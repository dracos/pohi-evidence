Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




1.       Executive Summary

         1.1.1     The Horizon IT System envisaged modernising the UK's Post Office branches. This was an
                   ambitious goal: placing hardware and software in c. 18,000 branch locations to allow
                   subpostmasters and subpostmistresses ("SPMs") the convenience to reliably store and
                   transmit electronic records of their daily business activities.


          1.1.2    The technical aspects of the Horizon IT System were significant but did not account for all
                   of the complexities of a successful implementation. There were additional organizational
                   factors that required attention. Both the technical and organizational dimensions of the
                   Horizon IT System also required vigilance. An IT system is a "living" entity. It needs care
                   and attention beyond its initial rollout.


          1.1.3    The Horizon IT System had multiple constituencies that needed to be both strategically and
                   tactically aligned. Sponsors and suppliers all played key roles in defining and delivering the
                   Horizon IT System.


          1.1.4    The Horizon IT System's design and implementation needed to account for real-world
                    contingencies. Many designs are very elegant, but they only maintain their elegance if the
                   implementation withstands practical realities and concerns.


          1.1.5    The Horizon IT System's user support mechanism needed to assist the users as they
                   migrated from a paper-based process to a computer-based process or switched from using
                   one system to another. Continuous training for all versions of the Horizon IT System needed
                   to be available. The support structure needed to cater to end-users (e.g., the SPMs and
                    clerks working in the branches) who might struggle to adapt to changes from the manual
                    processes they had undertaken for many years. The support structure needed to be able to
                   service a high volume of users. The support structure needed to be designed to adapt to the
                   needs of the users as the IT system evolved through its different versions.


          1.1.6    The Horizon IT System's internal error resolution mechanism needed to be able to quickly
                   resolve reported errors through identifying root causes, methodically correcting these errors,
                   and distributing the remedies in a timely and efficient manner.


          1.1.7    The Horizon IT System's functionality needed to maintain accounting integrity. The Horizon
                   IT System was the origin of sales and inventory information that flowed into the financial
                   systems of Post Office Counters Limited ("POCL"). Consequently, it was intended to be a
                   "source of truth" for these fundamental accounting facts. Any errors deriving from the
                   Horizon IT System would, if not otherwise rectified, be reflected in all downstream processes
                   and systems.


          1.1.8    Throughout my review, I identified shortcomings in each one of these key areas:


                   (a)    Constituency alignment: The tenuous relationship between ICL Pathway, its
                          suppliers, and its sponsors were often topics of concern for ICL Pathway's
                          management team; the Helpdesk was often the root of Service Level Agreement




                                                                                                               4
                                                                                                                 EXP00000001
                                                                                                               EXPG0000001


Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




                          ("SLA") issues with POCL; Acceptance Incidents ("Al") were a gating issue to the
                          financial success of ICL Pathway;


                   (b)    Design and implementation: Hardware issues were prevalent during national rollout;
                          many post offices were disconnected for extended periods of time; the persistence
                          of reference data mismanagement degraded the integrity of the Horizon IT System;


                   (c)    User support: SPM training experienced difficulties during national rollout; the
                          Helpdesk was often the root of SLA issues with POCL;


                   (d)    Error resolution: The System Management Centre ("SMC") was frequently cited for
                          not properly filtering calls to the System Support Centre ("SSC"); the SSC was
                          overwhelmed with escalated issues, as captured in PEAKs and PinICLs ("PPs"), but
                          were earnest in their efforts to perform their duties; and


                   (e)    Accounting integrity: The persistence of reference data mismanagement degraded
                          the integrity of the Horizon IT System. A persisting issue related to Al 376
                          (accounting integrity); payment and receipt imbalances were common symptoms
                          with varied causes.


          1.1.9    In my opinion, the stability of the Horizon IT System was affected by these shortcomings.
                   The sometimes-conflicting expectations between ICL Pathway and POCL introduced a
                    disruptive element at the management level. The effects of these disruptions manifested
                   itself throughout the implementation of the Horizon IT System. Other ICL Pathway self-
                   inflicted wounds included suboptimal support from ICL Pathway's program for training of
                   SPMs, the Helpdesk support of SPMs, and the Helpdesk support of ICL Pathway's error
                   resolution function.   A noticeable symptom of these issues was a recurrent balancing
                    problem experienced by the SPMs, which directly degraded the accounting integrity of the
                   Horizon IT System.




                                                                                                          5

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




2.       Introduction and background

2.1      My biography

          2.1.1    I, Charles Cipione, have been appointed by the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry ("the
                   Inquiry") to act as an Expert Witness to independently review and analyse evidence the
                   Inquiry has received on the Horizon IT System.


          2.1.2    By way of introduction, I am a Managing Director within the Risk Analytics group at
                   AlixPartners. I have been a Managing Director at AlixPartners for over fifteen years. I have
                   over thirty years of experience in information technology.


          2.1.3    I started my career at Arthur Andersen within their Information Systems Risk Management
                    business unit where I performed various general controls and application controls reviews.
                   At Arthur Andersen I also developed and implemented various database applications and
                   analyses related to litigation and bankruptcy clients.


          2.1.4    I left Arthur Andersen to start my own consulting venture, Cipione & Associates.       This
                   venture designed, developed, and maintained commercial software.         This software was
                   originally DOS-based (pre-Microsoft Windows) but was then versioned to migrate to the
                   Microsoft Windows platform. My preferred development environment for Microsoft Windows
                   applications was Microsoft Visual Basic.


          2.1.5    In 2001 I joined AlixPartners to help establish the Claims Management Services business
                   unit.   Our responsibility was to develop and operate systems to support the reporting
                   responsibilities of U.S. Chapter 11 (bankrupt) clients. Examples of these clients include
                    WorldCom and General Motors. This involved interrogating, collecting, and organizing vast
                   amounts of disparate financial and operational data from our clients' systems. I am the
                   original architect of AlixPartners suite of claims management systems. These systems are
                   currently still utilized.


          2.1.6    Utilizing my software design, development, and implementation background, I also have
                    been retained by clients to provide factual and expert testimony regarding the efficacy of
                   application systems and the management and analysis of data sets pertinent to various
                   litigation and regulatory issues.


          2.1.7    I hold a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and a Master of Business Administration from
                   Texas A&M University.


2.2      Background to the Report

          2.2.1    My review was conducted between the months of June 2022 and September 2022. I have
                    been supported by a team from AlixPartners.


          2.2.2    The evidence I have reviewed has been provided to me by the Core Participants, principally
                   Fujitsu Services Limited ("Fujitsu"), in response to formal requests made by the Inquiry
                   Legal Team. In addition, the Inquiry Legal Team have directed me to certain public




                                                                                                             6

                                                                                                                       EXPG0000001



Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

                    documents that have provided me with background information on the Inquiry as well as
                    background information, from prior legal judgements, on the Horizon IT System. As part of
                   my review, I have had the opportunity to pose questions to the Inquiry team, which have,
                   where appropriate, been passed to the relevant Core Participant to respond to. A list of the
                   information that I have relied on as part of my review is included in Appendix A.


          2.2.3    Based on my review of the available evidence I have produced this expert report, which
                    contains my observations and conclusion ("the/my Report") and I will provide oral expert
                   testimony ("the/my Testimony") to the Inquiry on this in due course.


          2.2.4    The intended audience for the Report is primarily the Chair of the Inquiry, and as part of
                   this it will be made available to the Core Participants in the Inquiry as well as to the public.


2.3      My instructions


          2.3.1    My work has been informed by a formal set of instructions provided to me, in two parts, by
                   the Inquiry Legal Team:


                   (a)    An initial set of instructions dated 27 May 2022 which were provided to me on 02
                          June 2022.


                   (a)    An addendum to these Instructions dated 27 July 2022 which were provided to me
                          on 27 July 2022.


          2.3.2    Collectively these two documents are my instructions from the Inquiry ("the/my
                   Instructions"). Whilst the Instructions provide the basis for determining the scope of my
                   work, I have, as an independent expert, been responsible for developing my own approach
                   to responding to the questions posed in my Instructions.


          2.3.3    Broadly, my Instructions state that my Report and Testimony should include:


                   (a)    An introduction to the Horizon IT System and other key terms that will assist the
                          Inquiry in understanding the substance of my Report, and potentially other future
                          submissions that are made to the Inquiry. I was instructed that this introduction of
                          the Horizon IT System should be tailored so as to be understandable to the Inquiry,
                          the Core Participants to the Inquiry, and to members of the public, who may not have
                          prior knowledge of the Horizon IT System;


                   (b)    Analysis to identify and illustrate any themes in the problems that were being
                          experienced by users in the period up to and including the roll out of the Horizon IT
                          System, including how these problems were resolved or escalated, and the key
                          individuals who were involved in these processes.


                   (c)    Any overall observations or conclusions, that are within my professional expertise,
                          as to the themes I identify and the potential reasons for these.


          2.3.4    The purpose of this Report is therefore two-fold, which I will set out in two distinct parts:




                                                                                                                   7

                                                                                                                       EXPG0000001


Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




                    (a)     Part 1: To provide an introduction to systems design and development and to the
                            Horizon IT System specifically, with the express purpose of providing a suitable
                            foundation of knowledge for an audience that does not have prior knowledge of the
                            Horizon IT System such that they can better understand both this Report, and the
                            subsequent phases of the Inquiry; and


                    (b)     Part 2: To set out, in detail, the information I was provided with, how I reviewed
                            this information, and the observations and conclusions I have reached.


          2.3.5     Whilst I was born in Europe, I have spent all of my professional working career in the United
                    States of America. I am very conscious that the vast majority of the people reading this
                    Report will be from the UK, and therefore I have adopted UK English spellings and have,
                    with the help of my UK-based colleagues, attempted to ensure I use a style that will hopefully
                    be familiar to a UK audience.


2.4      Scope of work and information relied upon

          2.4.1     The Inquiry is approaching the hearings in phases and there are seven phases that have
                    been defined (a full list of which can be found on the Inquiry's website under 'Phases of the
                    Inquiry' section'). In addition, the Inquiry has identified a list of 218 issues (the "Completed
                    List of Issues") which reflect the key themes on which the Inquiry intends to focus its
                    investigative work. The Completed List of Issues is available on the Inquiry's website'.


          2.4.2     My Instructions specifically relate to Phase 2 of the Inquiry, which deals with "Horizon IT
                    System: procurement, design, pilot, roll out and modifications." The Instructions also
                    identified that issues 1 to 28 from the Completed List of Issues are relevant to Phase 2 of
                    the Inquiry.


          2.4.3     The Inquiry has adopted the definition of the Horizon System which was used by Mr Justice
                    Fraser in his Judgment (No. 6) "Horizon Issues", being:

                            "the Horizon computer system hardware and software, communications
                            equipment in branch and central data centres where records of
                            transactions made in branch were processed'.


          2.4.4     My Instructions adopt the same definition of the Horizon IT System. It is worth noting that
                    the terms "Horizon system" and "Horizon IT System" are often used interchangeably:
                    they refer to the same thing, as defined above. In this Report I will use the term Horizon IT
                    System as I believe this to be a more fulsome description.


          2.4.5     In section 4 of this Report I will explain, in summary terms, what the Horizon IT System is,
                    what it did, how it was structured, and how the system evolved over time. At a very high
                    level, the Horizon IT System is an Information Technology ("IT") system that was installed,
                    in phases, into every Post Office branch in the United Kingdom (UK). The Horizon IT System
                    was installed into Post Office branches in the period 1999-2000 and is still in use in branches

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




                   today. Its function was to help digitise certain activities that took place in Post Office
                    branches, that is to say moving branches' processes away from paper-based systems to a
                   system where all transactions undertaken in a branch, as well as the resulting financial
                   accounts, were recorded electronically in the Horizon IT System. As with any IT system (old
                   or modern) the Horizon IT System had been updated frequently to add new functions and
                   to fix some identified issues (commonly referred to as "software bugs") in the system. Whilst
                   there have been numerous updates to the Horizon IT System over the years, it is generally
                   agreed that there have been three major versions of the Horizon IT System:


                   (a)    The original system, which was introduced into branches from 1999 onwards and
                          which was active until c. 2010. This is commonly referred to as "Legacy Horizon".


                   (b)    The first major iteration of the Horizon Online system (referred to as "HNG-X"),
                          which was introduced in 2010 and was active until c. 2017.


                   (c)    The second major iteration of the Horizon Online system (referred to as "HNG-A"),
                          which was introduced in 2017 and is still active and in use in branches today.


          2.4.6    Part One of this Report will provide further detail on the Horizon IT System and its various
                   iterations. The important point to note however is that my work, and therefore my Report
                   and my Testimony, is focused solely on Legacy Horizon, in accordance with my Instructions
                   and the temporal scope of the documentation that I received.


          2.4.7    My work, and therefore the observations and conclusions in this Report, are based solely on
                    documentary evidence and data provided to me by the Core Participants, being primarily in
                   this case, Fujitsu. The information I have been provided with are primarily contemporaneous
                    documentation and data that were created in the period 07 July 1996 to 31 December 2000
                   and are therefore between 21 and 26 years old as of the date of this Report. A list of the
                    documentation I have relied on as part of my review is listed in Appendix A.


2.5      Approach

          2.5.1    Three primary categories of documents were provided for me to review. These documents
                   represent the different lenses available to me as I collected observations and developed
                   themes about the Horizon IT System.


                   (a)    Monthly Reports ("MRs") —Various internal ICL Pathway management reports as well
                          as some joint ICL Pathway and POCL implementation reports.


                   (b)    PEAKs and PinICLs ("PPs") — ICL Pathway's error logging and remediation tickets.


                   (c)    Known Error Logs ("KELs") — ICL Pathway's known errors.


          2.5.2    I will describe these documents in greater detail further in my Report, but I wanted to
                   highlight that these documents are my main source of facts for accumulating observations
                   and synthesising themes. All other documents cited in this Report were used to gain an
                   understanding of the concepts and terms resident within the MRs, PPs and KELs.




                                                                                                              9
                                                                                                                      EXP00000001
                                                                                                                    EXPG0000001


Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




          2.5.3    In addition to reading, I incorporated a series of computer-assisted technologies to assist in
                   reviewing these documents. These methods will be described later in the Report, but the
                   volume of information required me to utilise multiple approaches to efficiently manage the
                   volume of content provided. A brute force approach to reading over 55,000 error log entries
                   was not only impractical, but inadvisable.


2.6      Structure of the Report

          2.6.1    The balance of my Report is organised in the following manner:


                   (a)     Part One:


                           (i)     A General Overview of Systems Design, Development, and Implementation


                           (ii)    A Description of the Horizon IT System


                           (iii)   A Description of ICL Pathway's Error Logging and Remediation Policies and
                                   Procedures


                           (iv)    A Description of the Materials Reviewed


                   (b)     Part Two:


                           (i)     A Description of how I organised the materials for further analysis


                           (ii)    An overview of Analyses Performed


                           (iii)   An itemised discussion of observations and themes


                           (iv)    Supporting Appendices


2.7      Limitations

          2.7.1    The primary documents in this review generally spanned the time frame of 1996 through
                   the end of 2000. Up to a quarter of a century has passed since these documents were
                   written. Many of these documents were intended for internal consumption by ICL Pathway;
                    consequently, I must account for the authors' possible intentions and motivations. These
                    documents were not written with me as the intended audience; they were written for
                   audiences with an intimate understanding of the technological, operational, and political
                    considerations of their era.


          2.7.2    As the documents provided only relate to the period 1996 to 2000 my review solely concerns
                   the roll-out of the Legacy Horizon IT System, not that of subsequent iterations of the system
                   (e.g., Horizon Online).


          2.7.3    As my review progressed, more questions came to mind: I asked the Inquiry to provide
                   more supporting information or clarifications. As this supporting material arrived, it often
                    generated more questions. This iterative process could have proceeded indefinitely, but




                                                                                                              10

                                                                                                                    EXPG0O000O1

                   time constraints limit the amount of "peeling the onion". A deeper understanding of the
                   system is always possible, but practical concerns demand a point of closure.


          2.7.4    These documents focus either on high-level managerial issues (as captured in the MRs), or
                   very detailed discussions of specific perceived errors (as captured in the PPs and KELs). They
                   only provide a partial view of the actual design, development, and implementation of the
                   Horizon IT System: they do not cover every facet of the technology's inception through
                   realisation. These documents overwhelmingly described the problems within the Horizon IT
                   System implementation; their purpose was to rectify problems, not laud accomplishments.


          2.7.5    The volume of documents, particularly the PinICLs and PEAKs was high. My review did not
                    consist of reading every one of these documents as I believe this would not be pragmatic or
                   an efficient use of time. I used a targeted approach for my review.


          2.7.6    The PinICLs, PEAKs, and KELs are very technical. The esoteric nature of these documents
                   (see example in Appendix C) means that nuances could have been missed. Conclusions
                   have been reached based on a review of the available material and my interpretation of
                   these. Others with different or specific experience may have differing interpretations of
                   these issues.


          2.7.7    I have not been able to quantify the frequency of occurrence of specific issues with the
                   Horizon IT System, other than based on the available materials. As described later in the
                   Report, the PPs relate to the activities of the third line of IT support. The first and second
                   lines of IT support are responsible for filtering out and de-duplicating reported incidents so
                   only a subset reaches the third line; therefore the PPs only present a partial picture of the
                   reported issues. I was not provided with the records relating to the first and second line of
                   IT support, which would presumably contain information on all of the IT incidents being
                   raised by the SPMs.


          2.7.8    Most of these documents represent ICL Pathway's perspective. Other than a few of the
                   Monthly Reports that were jointly issued by ICL Pathway and POCL, I do not have any insight
                   into POCL's view during this time period.

3.       The theory of system design and development

3.1      Enterprise Execution

          3.1.1     To properly understand software systems, it is important to appreciate how they fit into the
                    overall execution of the enterprise they support.          Software systems are enablers, not
                    panaceas. In the best situations, software applications can decisively improve the execution
                    of the enterprise's strategy by streamlining operations.           This often includes providing
                    complete and accurate reporting that informs decision makers in a timely manner. In the
                    worst situations, mismatched expectations and/or faulty designs and implementations
                    degrade the execution of the enterprise.


          3.1.2     The following five component model is intended to illustrate how software systems fit into
                    the broader execution of the enterprise:


3.2      Model Components

         Strategy:

          3.2.1     The enterprise's purpose for existence and ability to persist is guided by its strategy. High
                    level concepts such as mission and purpose statements are the guidelines that inform all
                    other aspects of the enterprise. The following text is the UK Post Office's purpose as of the
                    time of this writing3:


                            "We're here, in person, for the people who rely on us


                            Our Purpose has three equally important but distinct parts.


                            The first - "We're here" - recognises that Post Office is unique as the only
                            retailer in each nation and every community across the UK. With over
                            11,500 branches, we're at once universal and yet fundamentally local. And
                            this is only possible because our Postmasters are here for our customers
                            - much as Post Office is here to serve and support our Postmasters.
                            Without our postmasters, there would be no Post Office.


                            Next - "in person' Located in communities across the UK, Post Office
                            remains a vital part of the British high street even as many retailers
                            continue to leave it. Despite the recent acceleration of digital services
                            brought about by the pandemic, the simple reality is there will always be
                            some things that you can't do easily online - whether sending a parcel or
                            having a chat face-to-face. Our Purpose highlights the human connection
                            - the personal touch - we offer as a business.

                            And last, but certainly not least, we're there "for the people who rely on
                            us". Although the Post Office is for everyone, we know some parts of
                            society rely on us more than others. For the people that need us most,
                            we're proud to provide vital, trusted services that allow them to operate
                            in cash, pay their bills in person, verify their identity, and more as their
                            needs change."


         Tactics — Business Operations:

          3.2.2    To execute the strategy, it is important to have a mature and well-understood set of policies
                   and procedures.      Designing, developing, and implementing the tactical playbooks that
                    control the day-to-day business operations across all aspects of the enterprise takes
                    considerable effort. The balance between aspirational goals and realistic constraints is the
                   responsibility of those put in charge of making "real-world" decisions that affect how an
                   enterprise is operated.


         Software Systems:

          3.2.3    Supporting technologies buttress the business tactics defined by the enterprise's policies
                   and procedures. A software system's sole purpose is to efficiently reinforce the business
                   operations.


         Data Management (Facts):

          3.2.4    Software systems collect data (facts) relevant to the operations of the business.         The
                   management of these facts requires alignment of the software systems to the business
                   operations and anticipates downstream analytics and reporting.


          Analytics and Reporting:

          3.2.5    The enterprise consumes the facts, as represented by its data, through analytics and
                   reporting. This component of the model represents how the enterprise understands the data
                    collected and managed through a series of manipulations and summarisations of the facts.


3.3      Component Interdependence

          3.3.1    As implied by their definitions, there is a strong relationship between the components of this
                   model.     The strategy guides the tactics. The software systems support the tactics and
                    collects the facts. The data management organizes these facts. The analytics and reporting
                   interpret the facts. The tactics and strategy components then consume these interpretations
                   and adjusts as necessary based on these interpretations. In a healthy enterprise, this cycle
                   is transparent. All components understand and support each other.


3.4      Component Hierarchy

          3.4.1    It is important to understand that a clear pecking order exists between these components.
                   Strategy guides tactics. Tactics selects software systems based on their ability to conform
                   to defined business operation requirements. Data management is governed by the design




                                                                                                              14

                   specifications of the software systems. Analytics and reporting rely on the rules employed
                    by the data management function.


          3.4.2    Considering this hierarchical relationship, two concepts should be considered that affect a
                   healthy long-term relationship between the components: adaptability and complexity.


                   (a)    Adaptability:


                          (i)     The downstream components should respond to the requirements of the
                                  upstream components, not dictate them (e.g., the reporting requirements
                                  should not dictate the business's strategy) otherwise, instability would be
                                  introduced vis-a-vis the "tail wagging the dog".


                          (ii)    An example of an unstable situation would occur if the Analytics and Reporting
                                  component took on the responsibility of collecting ancillary data that was not
                                  represented by the requirements defined by the business operations. In this
                                  example, Analytics and Reporting would be infringing on the responsibilities
                                  that should be the purview of other components.          This would be a clear
                                  violation of the proper segregation of duties. The collateral consequences of
                                  this type of situation are inefficiencies of communication, maintenance, and
                                  costs.


                   (b)    Complexity:


                          (i)     Current efficiency and future flexibility benefit from complexity being localised
                                  as far downstream as possible.      Strategy should be high-level and easily
                                  comprehended. Tactics should be well-defined and as simple as possible to
                                  achieve strategic goals.    Software systems should strictly conform to the
                                  business's operational needs. Data management should be tightly governed
                                  by a set of data definitions. These definitions should anticipate the need for
                                  reference information for future analytics and reporting updates. Analytics
                                  and reporting should assume the responsibility for as much complexity as
                                  possible. This waterfall approach optimizes the responsiveness capability of
                                  the model.


                          (ii)    An example of not adopting this philosophy is represented by the Tactics
                                  component requiring the recording of information by the software system that
                                  could easily be derived through downstream methods.            Let's consider a
                                  requirement that wanted to isolate the reporting of sales by groups of postal
                                  codes. The business operations might put forth a requirement to the software
                                  system to not only record the postal code, but to also record whether those
                                  postal codes were offshore isles. Given this requirement, the software system
                                  would need to not only create the ability to record this data item, but also
                                  create the appropriate user input screens for the input of these indicators.


                          (iii)   Obviously, the offshore isle indicator is strongly aligned with the postal code,
                                  and therefore is redundant with the postal code. This complexity should not
                                  be the responsibility of either the business operations nor the software




                                                                                                                 15

                                     systems. Rather, this is clearly the responsibility of the data management
                                     component.      A reference table located within the data management
                                     component could be created to store this indicator that could then be used by
                                     analytics and reporting. The expected consequences of having this complexity
                                     too far upstream is the increased cost of implementation along with the
                                     possibility of faulty data due to the fact that users can input errors.


3.5      Systems Development

          3.5.1    At the outset, I want to clarify the distinction between the terms software and system.
                   Software is a computer program (application) that directs the operation of a computer's
                   hardware (e.g., monitors, hard drives, printers, networking equipment). System is how the
                   software and hardware perform in a holistic manner.              Unless specifically discussing a
                    computer program, I will use the more universal concept of a system.


          3.5.2    Systems development can be difficult to comprehend. This is understandable. The terms,
                    concepts, and methodologies are esoteric, myriad, and evolving.             Consequently, I am
                    dedicating a few paragraphs to expound on a few fundamental topics and how they can be
                   apprehended.


          3.5.3    Basics:


                   (a)       At the most abstract level, everything in a system can be characterized as building
                             blocks: input, processing, and output. Let's consider a simple electronic calculator.


                             (i)     The input is the keypad where you enter the keystrokes "2+2=".


                             (ii)    The processing is the computer chip that performs the arithmetic calculation.


                             (iii)   The output is the panel that hopefully displays "4".


          3.5.4    One might think of a "System" as being an extremely expansive network of these atomic
                   elements: input, processing, and output.


          3.5.5    Hardware devices:


                   (a)       At a tangible level, systems can be categorized by their hardware devices.          My
                             examples span across time and are intended as a representative, not comprehensive.


                             (i)     Input Devices — Keyboards, mice, touch screens, card readers, Storage
                                     Devices


                             (ii)    Processing Devices — Central processing unit ("CPU") (the "brain" of the
                                     computer)


                             (iii)   Storage Devices — Hard drives, memory (e.g., RAM), CD-ROMs, magnetic
                                     tapes




                                                                                                                 16
                                                                                                                    EXP00000001
                                                                                                                  EXPG0000001

                          (iv)   Communication Methods and Devices — Modems, ISDNs (Integrated Services
                                 Digital Network), the Internet, Bluetooth


                          (v)    Output Devices — Monitors, Printers, Storage Devices


                   (b)    Note: Storage Devices could be either an input or an output. For example, I might
                          want to save a spreadsheet to my hard drive today, only to retrieve it for further
                          work tomorrow. Today the hard drive would be considered an output because it is
                          the destination of my processing. Tomorrow, it would be considered an input as I
                          retrieve my spreadsheet for further processing. Then, as I save my changes, the
                          hard drive would once again revert to its output function. In both instances it is a
                          Storage Device, but Storage Devices can perform both the input and the output
                          function.   I am using this example for the purpose of illustrating the need for
                          understanding the contextual nature of the use of terms. Even in this very basic
                          explanation, we can foretell the bleeding of meanings.


3.6      Software Types

          3.6.1    As stated above, software is a computer program that directs the operations of the
                    computer's hardware. There are many different types of software, and they sometimes
                   interact directly with the hardware, sometimes interact with other pieces of software, and
                   sometimes they interact with the users.


                   (a)    Operating System ("OS") Software — The OS is the low-level software that allows all
                          other software to interact with the computer's hardware.          Examples include
                          Microsoft's Windows, Linux, and Apple's MacOS.


                   (b)    Database Management System ("DBMS") Software — DBMS software specializes in
                          managing large amounts of data, usually (but not always) in a structured set of
                          tables. This type of organization allows other programs and users to query and
                          analyse the data resident within and across these structures. Examples of DMBS's
                          include Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database.


                   (c)    Application Software — Application software, as the name implies, is software made
                          for a special purpose and is the type of software computer users interact with most.
                          Microsoft's Word and Excel are examples of application software.        The Counter
                          component of the Horizon IT System (described in detail later in this Report) is also
                          a type of application software.


                   (d)    Application Development Software — This is a type of software used by people and
                          teams to create application software. It allows teams to efficiently manage the
                          division of labour throughout the development process and assists with version
                          control (the ability to identify the exact code related to each application program
                          release).   Examples of application development software include Microsoft Visual
                          Studio and Android Studio.


          3.6.2    Certainly, there are many other types of software, but these four categories allow me to
                   illustrate how software types interact with each other.

          3.6.3    Let us consider an accounting application. This piece of software would have been developed
                   using an application development software and would likely be supported by a DBMS to
                   record and retrieve the accounting transactions entered by its users. Both the accounting
                   application and the DBMS will rely on the OS to coordinate all interactions between the
                   individual software and the hardware.


3.7      SDLC

          3.7.1    SDLC can stand for either Software Development Life Cycle or Systems Development Life
                   Cycle.    Software Development Life Cycle is narrowly focused on the development of the
                   software application. Systems Development Life Cycle casts a wider net and includes the
                   associated hardware being directed by the software. For purposes of this explanation, I will
                    be referring to Systems Development Life Cycle.


          3.7.2    There are a variety of approaches to SDLC. Different teams determine which is appropriate
                    based on their situation. I will explain SDLC across seven commonly used stages.


                   (a)      Planning - This stage of the life cycle includes determining what is being requested
                            and putting together a project plan to deliver the requested system. The project plan
                            estimates the amount of resources (people, time, and cost) required to complete the
                            remaining stages of the life cycle.


                   (b)      Analysis - This stage is where the design team gathers as much information as
                            possible about every detail of the requested system. This covers issues such as
                            functionality, performance, equipment, and cost.


                   (c)      Design - After the planning stage is complete, the technical design of the system is
                            documented. This is also the stage where it is determined what functionality will be
                            designed and developed internally, and what functionality exists externally and can
                            be purchased and incorporated into the overall solution. If an external resource is
                            determined to be appropriate, an integration portion of the design will be
                            documented. This also includes hardware selection. All other stages are dependent
                            on clear communication between the design team, the client, and the development
                            team. If there are miscommunications, functionality, time, and money will be at risk.


                   (d)      Development - Using the technical design document from the previous stage, the
                            development team will transform the design into a functioning system.


                   (e)      Testing - This phase is used to ensure that the results of the development phase
                            align with the expected functionality, performance, and hardware described by the
                            technical design document. There are usually two levels of testing.


                            (i)    Quality Assurance ("QA") - Carried out by a separate group of professionals
                                   associated with the development team prior to exposing the system to the
                                   user community.      QA must approve the efficacy of the system before
                                   promoting it to the next testing level.




                                                                                                              18

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




                          (ii)   User Acceptance Testing ("UAT") - A small group of users from the group
                                 requesting the system then performs "real world" testing to make sure that
                                 the system meets their expectations.


                          If there are issues at either level of testing, the development team is engaged to
                          remediate the issues, or to discuss any miscommunications that might be the source
                          of the identified issues. Oftentimes, there are certain benchmarks that define whether
                          the system can be promoted to the deployment stage. In other words, the system
                          does not need to be perfect to be deployed, but it does need to be acceptable to the
                          user community.


                   (f)    Deployment - Once the system has been promoted from the testing stage, it is then
                          ready to be deployed to the wider user audience. This can be done all-at-once, or in
                          stages. This is usually decided in the planning stage of the SDLC. As the system is
                          deployed, users also receive documentation and training on the use of the system
                          along with a contact mechanism for the system's helpdesk.


                   (g)    Maintenance - Issues missed in testing, new desired requirements, and general
                          operations questions are identified as a wider audience of users interact with the
                          system. These are usually captured and addressed by two support groups related to
                          the development team.


                          (i)    Helpdesk - This is the first point of contact for any user having issues with the
                                 system. General operational questions are addressed directly. Requests for
                                 new functionality are logged.     Perceived errors in the system are initially
                                 assessed. If the perceived error goes beyond the ability of the helpdesk to
                                 resolve, it is promoted to the error logging and remediation team.


                          (ii)   Error Logging and Remediation - A perceived error promoted from the
                                 helpdesk is further evaluated by this function.      If the perceived error is
                                 deemed to be valid, it is sent to the development team for remedial treatment.
                                 Depending on the type of error, the remediation could be quickly addressed,
                                 or require an indefinite amount of time to resolve. A communication back to
                                 the helpdesk occurs so that the reporting user can be alerted to the status of
                                 the remediation. If the perceived error is considered not to exist, advice is
                                 then reverted to the helpdesk. Important to the process is the ability to track
                                 symptoms and causes as the errors are identified and resolved.


          3.7.3    As the last stage of the SDLC initiates, it connects back to the planning stage to assess its
                   efficiency and to determine if new functionality should be pursued vis-a-vis new versions of
                   the system. If new versions of system are deemed appropriate, the process starts again.


3.8      Approaches to SDLC

          3.8.1    Over time, there has been an evolution of how the stages of the SDLC are modelled. The
                   oldest model, waterfall, required each step to be performed in sequence. Newer models
                   (e.g., Agile development) allow for subdividing the system and moving pieces to UAT as

                    quickly as possible. These approaches are iterative in nature, but benefit from increased
                   feedback from users to developers.


3.9      Possible Points of Failure

          3.9.1    As you might already have surmised, systems development covers a wide range of
                    considerations:   hardware,   software,   desired   functionality,   SDLC   approach,   clear
                    communications between constituencies, adherence to timelines and budgets, etc.


          3.9.2    Any missteps within or across any of these considerations will create a situation where the
                   system appears to be (or could in fact be) deficient. Constant attention to all details is a
                   necessary and understood regimen to delivering a stable system.




                                                                                                              20

4.       Introduction to the Horizon IT System

4.1      Overview

         4.1.1      The Horizon IT System is an information technology ("IT") system that was implemented
                    by the Post Office and installed into an estimated 18,000 Post Office branches throughout
                    the United Kingdom ("UK"), between 1999 and 2000. The system is still in use in Post Office
                    branches today, although it has been upgraded several times during its 20+ year lifetime.
                    Later in this section I will describe the Horizon IT System in greater detail, but before I do I
                    would like to provide some background to the Post Office and the services that its branches
                    supported, as this background will make it easier to understand the role and purpose of the
                    Horizon IT System.


         4.1.2      There have been a great many changes to the Post Office since 1999/2000, both IT-related
                    and non-IT related, and it is therefore impractical to encompass all of these in this
                    background section. This background section focuses on the structure and services of Post
                    Office branches in the period 1999-2000, being the period in which the Horizon IT System
                    was being introduced into Post Office branches for the first time.


         4.1.3      This section draws heavily on five documents that I was provided with:


                    (a)    the 'Technical Appendix to Judgment (No.6) "Horizon Issues" ("TAB)")4 ;


                    (b)    the 'Horizon System User Guide / Balancing with Horizon Guide' ("HSUG"), version
                           1.0 dated 28 July 20005;


                    (c)    the 'Technical Environment Description' ("TED"), version 4.8 dated 22 October
                           20026;


                    (d)    The 'Horizon OPS Reports and Receipts' ("HRR"), version 8.0 dated 08 August 2000;


                    (e)    The 'HNG-X Architecture - Counter Business Application' ("HXA"), version 5.0 dated
                           04 August 20178; and.


                    (f)    The 'Horizon Online Induction Training' presentation ("HOIT"), which is not dated
                           but is believed to have been produced in around August 20099.


         4.1.4      I have endeavoured to summarise these documents to what I consider an appropriate level
                    of detail for the Inquiry, but this has necessarily required me to omit some of the extensive
                    technical details of the system (the HSUG runs to some 819 pages, and the TED runs to

                    some 476 pages). I trust the readers will forgive, and indeed hopefully appreciate, this
                    simplification.


4.2      The Post Office and its branches

         4.2.1      The Post Office is responsible for operating a network of branches throughout the UK through
                    which it offers postal and other services to the general public. Although the formal company
                    name and structure of the Post Office have changed several times over the years, it has
                    remained, in essence, a government-owned company, and remains so today. For the
                    purposes of the period that is relevant to this Report, the Post Office had two main formal
                    names:


                    (a)    Between 1986 and 2001: Post Office Counters Limited ("POCL"); and


                    (b)    From 2001 onwards: Post Office Limited ("POL")


         4.2.2      In this Report where I refer to a "Post Office" I am referring to the physical branch and the
                    activities that took place there, rather than the actual organisations described above. Where
                    I do need to refer to the Post Office organisation, for ease and to avoid confusion, I will refer
                    to this as POCL.


         4.2.3      A Post Office branch is a physical location (albeit mobile branches also support some rural
                    communities) that members of the general public can visit in order to use various services.
                    Post Office branches can be classified into three broad groups, depending on who was
                    responsible for operating them:


                    (a)    Crown Post Office branches: these branches are directly managed by POCL and are
                           known as "Crown" post offices. They are run by employees of POCL (commonly
                           known as "Crown Office" employees).


                    (b)    Agency Post Office branches: these branches are owned by SPMs who are agents of
                           POCL. These were typically located within a shop or other small business. The SPM
                           receives payment from POCL for running the local branch, with their level of
                           remuneration depending upon the amount of business which is performed at the
                           branch. In some cases, the SPM would be supported by a manager or assistant.


                    (c)    Outreach services: these are typically small part-time branches that may use a village
                           hall or mobile van to provide post office services to communities that might not
                           otherwise receive them.

         4.2.5          The figure above shows that that vast majority of Post Office branches are Agency branches.
                        However, a POCL statement in 2003 indicated that, despite Crown branches only
                        representing some 3% of branches by number, they accounted for over 20% of the
                        transaction volume". In 2000 the Post Office had around 28 million customer visits each
                        week, across its branch network"Z.


4.3      Services available to customers at Post Office branches

         4.3.1          A Post Office branch provides a wide range of products and services to its customers. It is
                        estimated that a Post Office branch offered in excess of 170 different products and services13
                        Examples of services that a customer can use at a branch include:


                        (a)      Send parcels


                        (b)      Purchase stamps


                        (c)      Purchase lottery tickets


                        (d)      Pay utility bills (such as British Telecom ("BT") telephone bills)


                        (e)      Pay their car (vehicle) tax


                        (f)      Withdraw and deposit cash into their Girobank14 account

                   (g)     Withdraw and deposit cash into their account that they hold at certain high-street
                           banks.


         4.3.2     The above are all examples of transactions that a customer could complete in a Post Office
                    branch. In this Report, when I refer to "transactions," I am referring to any event in which
                    a customer used a Post Office service in a branch that needed to be recorded in a system.
                   For example, when a customer purchases stamps and pays for this purchase in cash. These
                   transactions would not include a customer doing something that did not result in the need
                   for this to be recorded in a system. For example, making an enquiry about the cost of
                    stamps. These transactions would also specifically not include the customer making a
                    purchase of items from the shop (such as bread or milk) in which the Post Office branch
                    happened to be located in.


         4.3.3     Customers could pay for their transactions using several different methods, such as:


                   (a)     Cash


                   (b)     Debit card


                   (c)     Cheque


         4.3.4     A Post Office branch would commonly have a shop associated with it, typically selling
                    everyday items, such as bread, milk, and newspapers. Transactions associated with the shop
                    would be kept separate from that of the Post Office branch, as they were, in effect, run as
                    two separate businesses. In fact, it was common for branches to have two physically
                    separate counters, one for shop transactions and one for Post Office transactions. Each
                    counter would have its own till for recording transactions and keeping cash and receipts. If
                    a customer wanted to buy a loaf of bread and also pay a BT telephone bill, they would need
                    to complete two separate transactions, each at different tills.


         Figure 4.2 A Post Office branch located within a local shop




         4.3.5     The majority of Post Office branches were Agency branches, owned and managed by SPMs.
                   As such, the cash and stock in the branch were owned by POCL but managed day-to-day by
                   the SPMs. Both cash and stock could periodically be sent centrally from POCL to the Post
                    Office branches if they were running low and could also be returned if the branch was holding
                   too much stock or cash.

         4.3.6       As can be seen from the list of services above, not all transactions that a Post Office offered
                     were internal to POCL. POCL was also providing services to other entities, both public sector
                     (e.g., Driver and Vehicles Licensing Agency ("DVLA"), Department of Work and Pensions
                     ("DWP")) and private sector (e.g., Camelot, BT and Girobank). POCL referred to these other
                     entities as "Clients". As such, some of the money transacted in the Post Office branch would
                     need to be subsequently sent to or obtained from Clients by POCL (e.g., if cash had been
                     deposited into a Girobank account by a customer of Girobank then POCL would need to send
                     this money to Girobank).


         4.3.7       It was important to keep a record of all transactions that were occurring in the branch, so
                     that POCL could work out which Clients it needed to pay money to, or claim money from, as
                     well as ensuring that its cash and stock could be accounted for.


         4.3.8       Prior to the introduction of the Horizon IT System, a Post Office branch would record
                     transactions in paper-form, and/or enter them into their own electronic point of sale
                     ("EPOS") system. I understand that prior to the introduction of the Horizon IT System some
                     branches used the ECCO+ EPOS system"


4.4      The Horizon IT System

         4.4.1       The Horizon IT System was installed (also referred to as being "implemented") into all Post
                     Office branches across the UK. The system was introduced in stages (also referred to as
                     "rolled out") between 1999 and 2000. The objective of the Horizon IT System
                     implementation was to modernise the point-of-sale and managerial accounting functions
                     across the network of Post Office branches. In modern terms this might be described as the
                     process of digitising' the Post Office branch network.


         4.4.2       The Horizon IT System is still in use in Post Office branches today, although the system has
                     been updated on many occasions throughout its 20+ year lifetime. Whilst there are many
                     different upgrades that have been made to the system, it is generally accepted that there
                     are three major versions of the system:


                     (a)     Legacy Horizon IT System ("LHITS"): First introduced in 1999


                     (b)     Horizon Online HNG-X ("HNG-X"): Introduced in 2010


                     (c)     Horizon Online HNG-A ("HNG-A"): Introduced in 2017


         4.4.3       Legacy Horizon, when it was first introduced, was known as the Horizon IT System, the
                     Horizon system, or simply Horizon. I assume that it became known as Legacy Horizon when
                     it was superseded by Horizon Online in 2010. The following section focuses on the structure
                     and workings of LHITS. In a later section I will briefly describe my understanding of the two
                     versions of Horizon Online.

4.5      Legacy Horizon (LHITS)


          A brief history of LHITS:

         4.5.1      The table below briefly outlines some of the key events in the development of LHITS:


         Table 4.1 A brief history of LHITS

 Date              Event
 May 1996          The Department of Social Security'6 ("DSS") and Post Office Counters Ltd ("POCL")
                   jointly awarded a contract to ICL Pathway Limited ("ICLPL" or "ICL Pathway") under
                   the Private Finance Initiative ("PFI") to develop an IT system that would:
                   •    replace the existing paper-based method of paying social security benefits; and
                   •    automate the national network of Post Offices.
                   The project was called "the Pathway Project", and the IT system it was to develop is
                   variously referred to as "Pathway Horizon", "Pathway", "Horizon IT System",
                   "Horizon system" or "Horizon".
                   At this time ICL Pathway Limited was a wholly owned subsidiary of International
                   Computers Limited ("ICL"). Fujitsu Limited ("Fujitsu") acquired 80% of ICL's shares in
                   1990, later purchasing the remainder in 1998. ICL was fully integrated into Fujitsu in
                   2002 and renamed Fujitsu Services Limited.
 September         A limited pilot stage known as "Initial-Go-Live" was implemented in 10 Post Office
 1996              branches in Stroud, Gloucestershire. The initial pilot was an interim system for the
                   payment of Child Benefit only and did not offer full functionality.
 November 1997     The IT system was extended to over 200 post office branches in the North-East and
                   South-West of England but still only provided for the payment of Child Benefit. The
                   deadline for completion of the operational live trial of the IT system was missed by ICLPL.
 March 1998        An interdepartmental working group was established to review the viability of the Pathway
                   Project and the consequences of cancellation. The working group comprised officials from
                   the Treasury, Cabinet Office, the Department of Trade and Industry ("DTI") and the DSS.
 July 1998         The interdepartmental working group reported that the Pathway Project remained feasible
                   but required successful re-negotiation of the contract with ICLPL.
 October 1998      Attempts to renegotiate the terms of the contract between the DSS, POCL and ICLPL
                   failed.
 May 1999          The original PFI contract awarded to ICLPL by DSS and POCL was terminated. The DTI
                   announced a new partnership agreement between POCL and ICLPL.
 July 1999         POCL and ICLPL agreed a fixed payment contract to automate the national network of
                   Post Offices.

 Late 1999         The roll-out of the Horizon IT System commenced in Post Office branches nationwide
                   (referred to as the "National Rollout").




16       Now the Department of Work and Pensions ("DWP"). Note that ICLPL also referred to this as the Benefits Agency
         ("BA") which was an executive agency of the DSS.

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




         Functionality of LHITS

         4.5.2      The Horizon IT System delivered in late 1999 was designed to provide two functional
                    services:


                    (a)     Electronic Points of Sale ("EPOS"): this function was to record, via electronic (rather
                            than paper) means:


                            (i)     purchases of Post Office products (such as stamps and stationery) made by
                                    customers of the branch; and


                            (ii)    transactions carried out by customers in the branch for the purchase of
                                    products or use of services provided by the Clients of the Post Office (e.g.,
                                    banks, National Lottery, DWP, DVLA etc).


                    (b)     Management accounting: this function effectively provided the SPMs and POCL with
                            accounts which summarised the cash and stock positions and payments and receipts
                            activity within a branch.


         4.5.3      The data processed by LHITS is high volume (in 2003 POCL stated that Horizon processed
                    nearly two billion transactions per year17) but is computationally relatively simple, that is to
                    say, it does not need to perform complex calculations on the data in order to fulfil its role.
                    Nonetheless, due to the number of branches, products, and customers it supports, the
                    Horizon IT System has been characterized as highly complex, but no more complex than
                    those used by multi-national banking institutions18. It is estimated the Horizon IT System
                    had over 3.5 million lines of programming code19 and that its documentation runs to more
                    than 100,000 documents20. Fujitsu had publicly stated that when they were awarded the
                    contract, in May 1996, Horizon was "...Europe's largest non-military IT contract"21.


         4.5.4      It is worth noting however that the Horizon IT System was created specifically for the
                    purpose of servicing the Post Office branches. It did not have the burden of integrating
                    existing technologies, except where it chose to do so, which limited the possibility of extra
                    complexity.


          Ambitious scale and scope

         4.5.5      In my view, the project to deliver the Horizon IT System was ambitious in both its scale and
                    its scope. It is worth reflecting on the state of technology around 1999, when the LHITS was
                    rolled-out:


                    (a)     The best-selling mobile phone of 1999 was the Nokia 321022. This had a monochrome
                            screen, did not support touch-screen navigation, and did not support internet access

                            2007 23.


                    (b)     In 1998 it was estimated that only 31-33% of UK adults had a personal computer
                            ("PC") at home24.


                    (c)     In 2000 it was estimated that only c. 30% of the UK adults had internet in their
                            homes 2s.


                    (d)     Modern social media had not yet been invented (Facebook was only founded in 2004).


                    (e)     The IT sector had invested heavily in addressing the "Millennium Bug" (also known
                            as the "Y2K" bug). At the time, some systems in use only stored the last two digits
                            of a year instead of the full four digits (e.g., 99, instead of 1999). If was feared that
                            at the turn of the new century this could cause code to malfunction. The original
                            reason for only using two digits was to save memory, as memory was expensive and
                            limited in the early days of computing.


                    (f)     The prevailing IT development methodology was the waterfall model in which
                            development progressed monolithically through a linear process, from design, to
                            build, to test and then to release. The modern concept of agile development was not
                            mainstream at that time.

         4.5.6      Some of the aspects of the LHITS development that I believe drove the complexity of the
                    system and its implementation were:


                    (a)     The need to design a system that connected all Post Office branches to a central
                            server but could also withstand a loss of connectivity, without impairing the ability of

                            the SPMs to serve their customers and allow the system to correctly synchronise once
                            connectivity to the central server was re-established.


                    (b)     The need to integrate a variety of software (e.g., Riposte and Tivoli) and hardware
                            (e.g., touch-screens, printers, communications equipment, bar code scanners, weigh
                            scales, PIN pads etc).


                    (c)     The need to accommodate hardware failures, as hardware components in the 1990s
                            were not as reliable as they are nowadays.


                    (d)     A large and diverse user base in the SPMs and the staff they employed, which would
                            have included varying levels of comfort using 'modern' IT systems. Fujitsu notes itself
                            that "Training was provided to 63,000 staff members from the age of 16 to 87 with
                            various skills levels."26 This would have presented, I believe, a significant training,
                            roll-out and support challenge.


                    (e)     Between August 199927 and December 200028, over 14,000 branches had LHITS
                            installed (see Table 4.2 below).


                    (f)     The physical challenges of installing bulky IT hardware into branches.


                    (g)     The need for the system to be very secure, as it dealt with the transfer of money as
                            well as holding personal details about Post Office customers 29.


         4.5.7      All of these challenges made, in my view, the design, build and roll-out of the LHITS very
                    ambitious.

         LHITS high-level design

         4.5.8      In systems considered modern in the late 1990s, architecture often was enacted among
                    three layers: user interface, business logic, and data. The business logic layer controls the
                    flow of data to and from the user interface layers. This division of labour sets boundaries of
                    responsibilities between development teams, consequently speeding the delivery of the
                    unified product.


         4.5.9      These systems, including LHITS, used data-driven logic as much as possible. Data driven
                    logic is where the mechanisms for computer algorithms refer to values stored in data
                    structures, rather than referring to application source code. This allows for changes to be
                    made to the data in the structures, without the need to alter existing application source
                    code. When applied properly, this approach bypasses source code related testing and
                    distribution activities, which often are very time consuming.


         4.5.10     An example will illustrate how data-driven logic compares to source code encapsulated logic.


         4.5.11     Let us consider the sales price for three products: hammer, screwdriver, and pliers. For the
                    purposes of this example, the sales price for a hammer is £5. The sales price for a
                    screwdriver is £7. The sales price for pliers are £6. Let us also assume a customer wanted
                    to purchase two hammers, three screwdrivers, and one pair of pliers.


         4.5.12     A computer application could deal with these prices in its source code. I will use pseudo-
                    code (a plain language description of what the code is supposed to do) to represent how the
                    source code might work.


                           Set the total basket amount to £O
                              If the product is a hammer, then
                                  Multiply the quantity of hammers by £5 and add this amount to the
                                  total basket amount
                              If the product is a screwdriver, then
                                  Multiply the quantity of screwdrivers by £7 and add this amount to
                                  the total basket amount
                              If the product is a pair of pliers, then
                                  Multiply the quantity of pliers by £6 and add this amount to the total
                                  basket amount




                                                                                                               ET

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




                                 If the product is not a hammer, screwdriver, or pliers
                                     Send a series of alert messages to rectify the issue

         4.5.13    This process would perform as intended. However, if the sales price for any of the products
                    changed, a change to the source code would be required. For simple computer applications,
                   this would be a trivial task that could be performed in a small amount of time. Conversely,
                   if the application was complex, changing, testing, and deploying the new version could take
                   a significant amount of time.


         4.5.14    Since price changes can be frequent, a data-driven logic approach is appropriate. In this
                   approach a data table with the item names and their prices is maintained and made available
                   to the computer application.


         Table 4.3 Product Master Table

                     Product                 Price
                     Hammer                    £5
                     Screwdriver               £7
                     Pliers                    £6



         4.5.15    The code for the application could now resemble.


                              Set the total basket amount to fO
                              For every product purchased
                                 Look for the product in the Product Master table
                                 If the product is found
                                           Multiply the quantity by the price and
                                           add the amount to the total basket amount
                                 If the product is not found
                                           Send a series of alert messages to rectify the issue

         4.5.16    In this approach, price changes are dealt with by maintaining the Product Master table:
                    changes to the source code are not needed. This does imply that the functioning of the
                   system is reliant on the integrity of information in the Product Master table. If the table is
                   updated in a timely manner, and maintains its informational integrity, the system is more
                   responsive to price changes.


         LHITS high-level structure

         4.5.17    There are many ways to describe the structure of the LHITS, but for simplicity I have
                    categorised these into four main components:


                   (a)        Counter and peripherals: These were the system components that were located in
                              branch, consisting of hardware and software;


                   (b)        Communications network: This was the network connection (functionally akin to the
                              communication role of an internet connection) which allowed data to be sent between
                              the branch and the LHITS Campuses (see below). This was commonly an ISDN




                                                                                                              31
                                                                                                                    EXP00000001
                                                                                                                  EXPG0000001

                           connection (a type of communications connection), although some rural branches
                           used a satellite link;


                   (c)    Messaging system: this was the software and protocols responsible for encapsulating
                           data that was then communicated between branches and the LHITS Campuses (see
                           below); and


                   (d)    LHITS Campuses: these were locations that centrally collected, stored, and processed
                           data on transactions from across the Post Office branch network and communicated
                           with POCL's systems and those of POCL's Clients. These campuses were located in
                          Bootle and Wigan.


         4.5.18    This diagram shows a simplified representation of how these components worked together.

                      (ISDN/satellite link)




         4.5.19    The system was designed to operate with an available network connection ("Online
                    mode"), but also to allow the Post Office branch to carry on serving customers, even if the
                    network connection was not available ("Offline mode"). In this Offline mode the Counter
                    was designed to accumulate transactions and synchronize with the broader system once the
                    communication connection had been re-established. The Counter kept enough information
                   to perform most tasks, regardless of connectivity status, but not all transactions could be
                    completed in Offline mode. Two notable transaction types that required the system to be in
                    Online mode were:




                                                                                                            32

                   (a)    Network Banking Service ("NBS"): Withdrawals of cash from the customer's high-
                          street bank accounts required an active network connection as funds availability
                          verification prior to withdrawal was only possible when in the Online mode.


                   (b)    Debit Card Service ("DCS"): Use of debit cards to pay for transactions also required
                          an active network connection as transaction authorisation was only possible when in
                          the Online mode.


         4.5.20    I will now explain in more detail components A, C and D. A further explanation of component
                   B (the communications network) is not, in my view, necessary in order to understand the
                   LHITS. The communications network was provided by a combination of BT and Energis and
                   was essentially a purchased service that the LHITS made use of, in much the same way as
                   a household pays for the use of an internet connection.

         Component A - Counter and peripherals

         4.5.21    The physical components of the Horizon IT System that were located in branch were:


                   (a)    Counter: A personal computer ("PC") running the Windows NT operating system.
                          This was loaded with various pieces of Horizon software, most notably Riposte;


                   (b)    Screen: A 10-inch colour touch screen or 12-inch flat panel screen;


                   (c)    Keyboard: A specialised financial keyboard with magnetic stripe reader and Smart
                          Card reader;


                   (d)    Bar code reader: A handheld bar code reader that could be used to read pre-printed
                          barcodes on items such as utility bills;


                   (e)    Weigh scales: Scales for weighing postal items (e.g., parcels);


                   (f)    Tally roll printer: A printer used for producing customer receipts as well as some
                          summary reports for the SPM;


                   (g)    PIN pad: Number pad used by customers for entering their Personal Identification
                          Number ("PIN") to verify debit card transactions; and


                   (h)    A4 printer: A printer used by the SPM for non-customer administration tasks (e.g.,
                          printing summary reports).


         4.5.22    I understand that approximately 46% of branches had only one Counter installed, with
                   approximately 33% having two Counters installed, and the remaining having three or more
                   Counters. Some branches had twenty Counters installed. Across the approximately 18,000
                    branches in which the LHITS was installed there were approximately 38,000 Counters. At
                   any given branch there was only one Counter that was connected to the LHITS Campuses;
                   this Counter was referred to as the "Gateway Counter" or "Gateway PC".


         4.5.23    In order to use a Counter the SPM or a member of the branch staff (collectively referred to
                   hereafter as "Clerks" or "Counter Clerks") would need to log in to the Counter using their
                   assigned username and password.


         Single-Counter branches

         4.5.24    Smaller branches, such as those located in rural villages, would typically only have one
                   Counter in them. The diagram below shows the Counter setup in a single-Counter branch,
                   along with the other devices connected to it (e.g., keyboard, screen etc, collectively referred
                   to as "Peripherals"). Also included below are photos of the LHITS Counter and Peripherals
                   in a branch.

         4.5.26    Multi-Counter branches could make use of additional LHITS functionality, such as the ability
                   the transfer an open session between Counters, that is to say if a Clerk starts serving a
                    customer on one Counter (Counter 2), but then logs on to another Counter (Counter 3), the
                    current customer session, containing the purchases they have selected so far, is
                   automatically transferred to Counter 3 and the Clerk is automatically logged out of
                   Counter 2.


         Software - The Riposte Desktop

         4.5.27    The Counters ran on the Windows NT operating system, but a user was prevented from
                    directly accessing Windows. Instead, when logging in to a Counter they were automatically
                    directed to a piece of software that had been specifically configured for the Post Office, the
                    Riposte Desktop. This was largely based on a commercial product named Riposte from the
                    Escher Group. The Escher Group is a separate company from ICLPL and Fujitsu. The Counter
                    User Interface ("UI") was designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible and is
                    specifically tailored for use in a retail environment. The intention is that unless absolutely
                    necessary, the Clerk should not have to type in any data on the terminal. Many transactions
                    are initiated automatically by the Clerk swiping a magnetic card or reading a bar code using
                    the Counter's bar code reader. Interaction with the system is achieved by using the keyboard
                    or the touch screen.


         4.5.28    The screen is split into two parts. The left-hand portion contains a number of menu buttons
                    which are valid in the context of the transaction (though some may be marked with a "stop
                    sign" which indicates that they cannot be used in this particular transaction.) The right-hand
                    side of the screen is a "stack" showing, for example, the purchases made by the customer
                    so far.




                                                                                                               36

         Stock Units

          4.5.29      An important concept to understand is that of Stock Units ("SUs"). A Stock Unit is a unit,
                      created on the LHITS system to which cash and stock (e.g., stamps and stationery) are
                      assigned and to which transactions are associated. The Stock Unit mirrors how stock and
                      cash were physically managed in the branch (i.e., they could, depending on how the branch
                      was managed, represent the contents of the till tray). Each branch will have at least one
                      Stock Unit, and multi-Counter branches may have multiple Stock Units, possibly aligned to
                      the different Counters. Stock Units are a way of managing cash and stock and these Stock
                      Units can be allocated by the SPM on a medium-term basis, to individual Counter Clerks.
                      The Counter Clerk is then responsible for ensuring that the Stock Unit balances at the end
                      of the week, or whenever the Stock Unit is de-allocated from them. I describe the process
                      of Stock Unit balancing in section 4.7. Stock Units are assigned identifiers such as "DD" or
                      "AA". The SPMs can transfer stock between Stock Units using a function on the Counter.
                      Stock Units can be individual (i.e., assigned to one Counter Clerk only) or can be shared
                      between multiple Counter Clerks. In some circumstances the SPM may choose to allocate a
                      Stock Unit to certain specific stock, such as Lottery scratch cards.


          Modes

          4.5.30      Another important concept to understand is that of modes. The Counter supports the concept
                      of Modes. Examples of modes are "Serve Customer" ("SC"), "Transfer Stock In" ("TSI"),
                      "Rem      Out         Supply      Division"          ("ROSD"), "Rem In Supply                   Division" ("RISD")   and
                      "Housekeeping" ("HK"). The mode is selected by the user on the Counter applications as
                      they see fit. The current mode is indicated at the top left-hand corner of the Desktop screen




                                                                                                                                           37

                         (e.g., in Figure 4.8 the Counter is in the "Serve Customer" mode as indicated in the top left-
                         hand corner of the screen). A Counter is in only one of a small set of predefined modes. A
                         mode may have the effect of making certain desktop functions unavailable. For example,
                         the Logout function is not available while the Counter is in Serve Customer mode; the Clerk
                         has to settle (complete) the current session before they can log out.


              Remming in and remming out

              4.5.31     The Counter supported the activity of recording the movement of cash and stock from the
                         branch to POCL or vice versa. Stock and cash might be returned to POCL if the branch was
                         carrying an excess, or certain stock items had expired (e.g., stamps being taken out of
                         circulation). The term used for accepting a delivery of cash or stock from POCL by the branch
                         is called "remming in"; the term used for delivering cash or stock from the branch to POCL
                         is called "remming out".


              Horizon Transaction Data

              4.5.32     There are three types of transactional data in the Horizon IT System31: Manual entries, TCs,
                         and Fujitsu entries:


                         (a)     Manual entries are the data entered by the SPMs through the normal course of
                                 utilising the Counter.


                         (b)     Transaction Corrections ("TCs") are produced by the Post Office to be accepted by a
                                 user at the Post Office branch to correct discrepancies in accounting.


                         (c)     Fujitsu entries are injected into the Horizon IT System directly by Fujitsu and may be
                                 used to balance discrepancies.


              Coding of the Counter in LHITS

              4.5.33     LHITS was coded in Visual Basic, C, and C++. LHITS also utilized Oracle development tools
                         and the Riposte product.


              Component C - Messaging system

              4.5.34     The Counter uses a messaging infrastructure provided by a system called Riposte (and later
                         WebRiposte), provided by Escher. Everything that Riposte handles is stored as a message.
                         Messages are constructed using a format known as Attribute Grammar. This is a self-defining
                         and nested record format that is technology independent. Data fields (or attributes) are not
                         positional but are identified by a preceding attribute name. They are a tree-like structure
                         and could be considered a proto-markup language (akin to the XML format we are more
                         familiar with today). Attributes can be optional and new attributes can be added over time
                         without existing applications being affected. Applications use just those attributes they are
                         interested in and are not 'aware' of the rest.

         4.5.35    Let us continue to use our hammer, screwdriver, and pliers transaction to illustrate what a
                   tree-like structure might look like. As a reminder, a purchase of two hammers, three
                   screwdrivers, and one pair of pliers is our example.


         4.5.36    The tree-like structure might use the relationships.


                          Sales transaction
                          Customer
                          Items Purchased
                          Item I
                          Item I Quantity
                          Item I Price
                          Item I Total Purchase Amount
                          Item 2 ....
                          Item 3 ...
                          Total Basket Purchase Amount

         4.5.37    In our example, this could be represented as follows.


                          <Sales Transaction Start>
                          <Customer Name> "John Doe"

                          <Item 1 Name> "Hammer"
                          <Item 1 Quantity> 2
                          <Item 1 Price> £5
                          <Item 1 Total Purchase Amount> £10
                          <Item 2 Name> "Screwdriver"
                          <Item 2 Quantity> 3
                          <Item 2 Price> £7
                          <Item 2 Total Purchase Amount> £21
                          <Item 3 Name> "Pliers"
                          <Item 3 Quantity> 1
                          <Item 3 Price> £6
                          <Item 3 Total Purchase Amount> £6
                          <Total Basket Purchase Amount> £37
                          <Sales Transaction End>
         4.5.38    An example of an Attribute Grammar is contained in Appendix B.


         4.5.39    Normal transactions at the Counter take place within a customer session. Each physical
                   transaction with the customer (e.g., stamp sale, benefit book encashment, postal order sale)
                   results in the creation of one or more messages depending on the complexity of the
                   transaction. For example, a stamp sale has one message, and a postal order results in two
                   messages (one for the postal order and one for the fee). None of these messages is normally
                   written to the message store until the customer "settles" the session. This results in an
                   additional transaction for each Method of Payment ("MoP") used. A key feature of each
                   session is that they are 'zero-sum' that is to say the debits and credits of the transactions
                   must sum to zero (e.g., if a session has transactions for the purchase of £5 of stamps and
                    £2 of envelopes then the same session must contain a payment, such as cash, for £7).




                                                                                                             39

                                                                                                                     EXPG0000001

         4.5.40      When a Clerk completes a session then the resulting transactions, in the form of Attribute
                     Grammars, are saved locally on the Counter in the "Counter Message Store" (also known
                     as the "Riposte Message Store"), a local repository of all transactions executed on that
                     Counter. Where there is more than one Counter in an Outlet, the Riposte Message Store is
                     replicated across all of the Counters. Where there is only one Counter, the Counter contains
                     two mirrored disks, one fixed and one exchangeable, so that the message store can be
                     recreated on a replacement Counter if necessary (e.g., in the case of a hardware failure).


         4.5.41      Riposte had a data replication facility. In the event the wide area network was unavailable,
                     the Counter would accumulate messages in the Counter Message Store until the
                     communication facility was reconnected. When the reconnection was established, the
                     Counter's messages would be synchronized with a version of the message store saved on
                     the LHITS Campuses, in their Correspondence Servers (the "Correspondence Server
                     Message Store").


         4.5.42      Much of the data required by Counter applications, including much of the way in which they
                     operate, is passed in "Reference Data", which is distributed via the same Riposte
                     messaging mechanisms. Reference data originates with either:


                     (a)      POCL: reference data from POCL providing, for example, product lookup data
                              containing prices etc.;


                     (b)      Client: reference data from Clients containing information specific to them, such as
                              Stop Lists32; or


                     (c)      Application: reference data from LHITS itself which tells the system how to operate
                              (e.g., what options to make available in certain screens).


         4.5.43      This Reference Data is distributed to all relevant branches. It enables the construction of
                     "soft centred" (data driven logic) applications whose operation can very easily be modified
                     by changes to the Reference Data (as discussed earlier). A copy of the Reference Data is
                     saved locally on each Counter in the Counter Message Store. This local copy enables the
                     branch to carry on operating and completing customer transactions, even if the connection
                     with the LHITS Campuses is not available (for instance, if the network communication is
                     lost).

         Component D - LHITS Campuses

         4.5.44     The LHITS Campuses are actually a collection of different IT components that supported the
                    'back-office' of the Post Office. They were located at two sites referred to as "Campuses"
                     located in Bootle and Wigan. Resident within the Campuses were several important
                     functions/processes:


                    (a)     The Correspondence Layer;


                    (b)     The Agent Layer;

                    (d)     Reference Data Management System; and


                    (e)     Data Warehouse.


         4.5.45     Two important external services33 that the LHITS Campus supported were:

         4.5.46     The Correspondence Layer handled communications of the network. The Correspondence
                    Layer and Counter Layer share the use of the Riposte Message Service ("RMS"), a message
                     storage and replication mechanism, as previously                described, which runs on the
                    Correspondence Servers and the Counter. This supports a shared, distributed message store

         I note that it could be argued that some elements of these services were contained within the LHITS Campus, but for
         simplicity I describe them as external services.

                   to ensure that information generated at the Counter is replicated in the Campuses and vice
                   versa. These Riposte mechanisms interact directly with the Agent Layer. A specialised
                   Riposte Archiver, running on the Correspondence Servers, is used to ensure that all Riposte
                   messages are written to tape for audit purposes.


         4.5.47    The Agent Layer is responsible for transforming the message-based view that is appropriate
                   for the Counter application into a file view of the Host Layer. It provides facilities to pass
                    data in both directions: from the Host layer to the Counter, and vice versa. It also provides
                   facilities to pass messages directly to third party Clients, and to return the Client response
                   to the Counter. The Host Layer applies any business rules to the information being received
                   from or sent to the external client system.


         4.5.48    The Reference Data Management System ("RDMS") manages all reference data such as
                    product information and operational elements. POCL's Reference Data Management Centre
                   ("RDMC") supports the loading and release of reference data. The Reference Data
                   Distribution Service ("RDDS") distributes reference data to all branches and data centres.
                   RDMS is utilised by many elements of the LHITS. It is an example of LHITS's data-driven
                   logic; therefore, its integrity is important for the proper operation of LHITS.


         4.5.49    The Data Warehouse is a database, or set of databases, used by POCL for querying and
                   reporting purposes. The Data warehouse is populated from different sets of information
                   flowing through the hosts.


         4.5.50    The Transaction Processing System ("TPS") harvests transactions from the Counters at all
                    branches and passes them along to POCL's Transaction Information Processing ("TIP")
                   system via the TIP interface.


         4.5.51    The Management Information Services ("MIS") is a component built onto the Data
                    Warehouse to detect errors (including programmatic errors) in the LHITS through a series
                   of reports and spreadsheets.


         4.5.52    TIP was a system used by POCL to collect transaction records about all transactions that
                   occur at all branches. Transactions are gathered in the first instance by the TPS (once the
                   Counter has set the End-of-Day ("EoD") marker) which collects all messages that result
                   from Counter transactions, stock unit balancing and branch cash accounting, and feeds them
                   into the TPS database, from where they are fed to TIP. TIP was used to feed POCL's
                   accounting system and to reconcile transactions with its Clients. While LHITS is not an end-
                   to-end accounting system, the data it passes to POCL and its Clients must be sufficient to
                   enable them to balance their own books and settle accounts between them.

           Updates to LHITS

           4.5.53     I understand that there were several software updates made to LHITS between its initial
                       roll-out in 1999-2000 and Horizon Online being introduced in 2010. Paragraph 97 of the
                      TABJ lists these updates; however, little detail is provided as to the nature and content of
                       these updates. I will highlight a few of these updates.


                      (a)     Starting in August 2000, the Core Systems Release ("CSR") introduced Automated
                              Payment Service ("APS"). APS supports payments by customers to utility companies
                              (e.g., BT, electricity companies, water companies etc) and other Clients of POCL using
                              bar-coded bills, magnetic cards or smart cards. In addition, this release introduced
                              reconciliations between the APS data harvested by the APS Agents and the data
                              harvested by TPS. I understand that there was a subsequent Core Systems Release
                              Plus ("CSR+"), however I do not have information as to the nature of this software
                              update.


                      (b)     In February 2001, an upgrade to LHITS, called Maintenance Release M1, was rolled
                              out. The main purpose of this upgrade was enhancements of the CSR+ applications.


                      (c)     In June 2001, the S06 Release Day D rectifications were released. This included,
                              amongst other things, a receipts and payments fix.


                      (d)     In 2002/2003 Network Banking Service ("NBS"), Debit Card Service ("DCS"), and
                              Data Reconciliation Service ("DRS") were introduced.


                              (i)     NBS provides facilities for customers of selected banks and building societies
                                      (those with which POCL had reached an agreement with) to withdraw money
                                      from and deposit funds into their bank accounts.


                              (ii)    DCS enables customers to pay for goods and services using Debit Cards. A
                                      card may be used for some or all of the value of a customer session. The
                                      transaction is verified by online reference to a merchant acquirer who either
                                      approves or declines it.


                              (iii)   DRS takes information relating to all NBS and DCS transactions and reconciles
                                      the different data flows. It maintains data about transactions until they are
                                      reconciled (this may take some days) and for 90 days thereafter.


                      (e)     I note that the TED states that NBS and DRS were delivered as part of release BI3
                              and that DCS was delivered as part of release S30.


                      (f)     In 2004 the Post Office Ltd Finance System ("POLFS"), a SAP accounting system,
                              was implemented. LHITS TPS delivered data directly to POLFS.             The following text
                              comes from an Operations Manual dated December 200634: "The introduction of the
                              Post Office Ltd Finance System (POLFS) in Product and Branch Accounting (P&BA),

                          accounts on site. The adjustments have to be made at your branch and are necessary
                          when branch transaction data does not align with client or supplier data.".


                   (g)    Although no date is explicitly cited in the TAB], at some point in 2004, I believe, a
                          programme called IMPACT was delivered. This programme included several updates
                          to LHITS35, including:


                          (i)     rollovers will subsequently be based on a Trading Period ("TP") that lasts 4 to
                                  5 weeks instead of the weekly Cash Accounting Period ("CAP") used
                                  previously in the LHITS;


                          (ii)    non-value stock declarations were removed and stock balancing no longer
                                  checked that such declarations have taken place;


                          (iii)   the new concept of Local Suspense account was introduced for the processing
                                  of variances (or discrepancies as they were formerly known);


                          (iv)    Stock Units will subsequently no longer be allowed to carry discrepancies over
                                  and any discrepancies will be moved into Local Suspense when the Stock Unit
                                  rolls over;


                          (v)     Additional checks were carried out in order for the final Stock Unit to roll over:
                                  (1) the last Stock Unit was not allowed to roll over if there were outstanding
                                  Transaction Corrections (TCs); (2) Local suspense must be cleared (settled)
                                  before the final stock unit could roll over to the next Trading Period; and


                          (vi)    Changes to the data server were made to reduce the number of times that
                                  the message store was scanned to pick up transactions during balancing. A
                                  Riposte mechanism known as "Notifications" was used to add new transactions
                                  to the existing totals as further transactions were generated during the
                                  balancing process 36


                   (h)    In around 2010, POLFS and SAPADS were merged to make POLSAP. I understand
                          that SAPADS was POCL's stock control system (in conjunction with the Logistics
                          Feeder System ("IFS")), responsible for ensuring that branches maintained adequate
                          and appropriate levels of stock and cash.

4.6        Horizon Online

           4.6.1      I understand that the original Horizon Online system (HNG-X) was piloted in late 2009 and
                      rolled out in the spring of 2010. HNG-X replaced LHITS. I understand that there were several
                      reasons for the release of HNG-X, including:


                      (a)     Reducing the cost of running Horizon: A Post Office branded document titled
                              'Introducing Horizon Online' and dated September 2009 contains the following
                              passage37: "Why is the Post Office@ making changes to Horizon. The Post Office in
                              recent years has made significant losses. The current Horizon application contributes
                              to this financial position by being a major cost to the Post Office. Horizon Online will
                              cost significantly less to run, maintain and change. These savings will improve our
                              commercial position increasing our opportunities to retain current work and to bring
                              in new business."


                      (b)     Taking advantage of improved communication technology reliability: The
                              improved reliability of network technology meant that it was feasible to have
                              branches that were "online" the vast majority of the time. This benefited a wider
                              change in the business as an increased proportion of transactions involved NBS and
                              DCS, which required an active connection to the Data Centre.


                      (c)     Simplify the design of the User Interface: A Post Office branded document titled
                              'Introducing Horizon Online' and dated September 2009 contains the following
                              passage38: "Horizon Online has a more logical grouping of products and services as
                              well as fewer product screens to navigate overall. This means that the buttons for
                              the majority of products and procedures may be found within three screens."


                      (d)     Simplify business process: I understand that HNG-X also simplified some of the
                              processes that an SPM was required to complete as part of the back-office
                              administration of the branch. A Post Office branded document titled 'Introducing
                              Horizon Online' and dated September 2009 contains the following passage39: "...the
                              maximum number of branch reports that may need to be produced has been reduced
                              from 85 to 44".


           4.6.2      In describing the differences between LHITS and HNG-X I will revert to the four component
                      model I used to describe LHITS.


           Component A — Counter and Peripherals

           4.6.3      The hardware components of HNG-X were almost identical to that for LHITS. I understand
                      that new Tally roll printers were installed but beyond that the hardware remained largely
                      the same and the Counter continued to run the Windows NT operating system.


           4.6.4      One important change was that every branch received a new router, a piece of hardware
                      which allowed the branch to connect to the Data Centre. This router had a physical line

                    connecting it to the Data Centre but it would automatically switch over to a mobile backup
                    network, via either Orange or Vodafone (subject to network coverage) if the primary
                    communication link went down. A related change was that multi-Counter branches were no
                    longer connected to the Data Centre via the Gateway PC, they connected directly to the
                    router.

         4.6.5     HNG-X's new architecture had four layers: Presentation, Interaction, Business, and Services.


                   (a)        The presentation layer is responsible for displaying information to the user and
                              accepting user inputs.


                   (b)        The interaction layer provides the foundation for the presentation layers, such as
                              menus. The combination of the presentation and interaction layers was a replacement
                              for the Riposte technology.


                   (c)        The business layer provides the business applications in an object-oriented manner.


                   (d)        The services layer provides a set of software objects that support many business
                              applications. Within the service layer exists a process engine. The process engine
                              provides a simplified sequence of steps for the counter to deliver services.


         4.6.6     Some data is stored persistently at the Counter, such as reference data, process definitions,
                    and report definitions. Customer transactions are not stored at the Counter.


         4.6.7     The service layer is the only layer that communicates with the data centre. The service layer
                    also provides the interface for on-line services, which includes banking, the use of
                    debit/credit cards, and mobile phone services.


         4.6.8     The biggest change to a Counter Clerk would have been the UI, which changed significantly.

         4.6.9                     In addition, I understand that there were some changes to the available functionality, for
                                   example the ability to transfer sessions between Counters was removed in HNG-X.


         Coding of the Counter in HNG-X

         4.6.10                    HNG-X was coded predominantly in Java, replacing the Visual Basic components used in
                                   LHITS.


         Component C - Messaging system

         4.6.11                    As HNG-X only stored transaction data at the Data Centre, and not locally on the Counter,
                                   the Riposte message store was no longer required. Reference data was still stored locally
                                   on the Counter. The messaging system used the XML format (instead of Attribute Grammars
                                   used in LHITS) and used the TCP/IP protocol (instead of UDP/IP in LHITS) to send data
                                   between the Counter and the Data Centre.

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




         Component D — HNG-X Data Centres (nee Campuses)

         4.6.12     As part of the move to HNG-X there were various updates made to the Data Centre, however
                    for the purposes of simplicity I will highlight only two. The Branch Access Layer ("BAL")
                    and the Branch Database ("BRDB") were new elements introduced in HNG-X. BAL's function
                    was to exchange messages with the counter software and to perform audit and validation
                    functions.     BRDB was a high-performance Oracle database used to store customer
                    transactions from all branches.


         Updates to Horizon Online

         4.6.13     I have only been provided with very limited documentation related to updates made to HNG-
                    X and therefore the below is by no means a comprehensive list of the changes, let alone
                    changes that I might consider to be material enough to warrant highlighting.


                    (a)     In 2012, a fix was introduced (known as the "Ping fix") which was related to Camelot
                            accounting for the National Lottery. I understand that as part of this fix Transaction
                            Acknowledgements ("TAs") were introduced. TAs are non-counter transactions and
                            typically initiate from somewhere else. This is from another area outside the Horizon
                            IT System. These transactions are typically relayed to POCL or Fujitsu and need
                            "accepting" into Horizon before forming part of the branch's transaction data. This
                            is done by means of TAs sent to each branch. The SPM does not have the option to

                    (b)     In 2017 a new version of Horizon was released, HNG-A. I have not been provided
                            with any substantial documents which detail the changes delivered as part of this
                            upgrade; however, I understand that one of the major changes was that the
                            operating system that the Counters used was upgraded from Windows NT to Windows
                            10. This was necessary due to the obsolescence of Windows NT.



4.7      Balancing and Roll-over


         4.7.1      POCL procedures required that SPMs undertake various regular processes on the LHITS. One
                    of the prominent ones I see referenced in the PEAKs, PinICLs and KELs ("PPKs") is in relation
                    to the Cash Account Period ("CAP"). This was a weekly cycle that started at the start of
                    business on a Thursday and ran through to close of business on the following Wednesday40
                    (in 2004 I understand that POCL moved to a monthly Trading Period ("TP") cycle, with
                    months made up of 4 or 5 weeks4").


         4.7.2      The CAPs are numbered sequentially, (e.g., CAP1 is followed by CAP2, and so on) and mirror
                    the financial year of POCL which starts at some point in March each year and runs to 52 or
                    53 weeks. The CAP is of particular interest as it acted as a weekly reconciliation point for a
                    branch. The data stored in LHITS was compared to the cash and stock physically held in
                    the branch at the end of the CAP. I understand that this weekly reconciliation process is
                    referred to as "balancing", and this was undertaken for each Stock Unit in the branch. Only

                     once the SPMs had balanced all of their Stock Units were they permitted to roll-over the
                     branch to the next week (i.e., the next CAP). The process of balancing their Stock Units and
                     moving to the next CAP were commonly referred to as "roll-over" or "rolling over".


         4.7.3       A CAP is further divided into Balance Periods ("BPs"). Each CAP must have at least one BP
                     but can have more than one. BPs allow an SPM to balance their Stock Units without rolling
                     over to the next CAP. This could be used, for example, to perform an interim mid-week
                     balancing, or to balance a shared stock unit when one Clerk handed this over to another
                     Clerk.


         4.7.4       The CAP and BP were displayed on the LHITS screen (see Figure 4.8)42 and the TP and BP
                     were displayed on the HNG-X screen (see Figure 4.13).


         4.7.5       In order to balance and roll-over an SPM had to undertake various steps, a summary of
                     which I have reproduced here43. This process would be undertaken for each Stock Unit that
                     the branch operated:


                     (a)      check all of the stock (e.g., envelopes etc) they held in branch against the system
                              held values and adjust these values in the system where required;


                     (b)      declare the stamps that they held in branch (i.e., count up each denomination of
                              stamps they held and enter these into the LHITS);


                     (c)      declare the cash they held in branch (i.e., count up each denomination of coins and
                              notes in the till and enter these into the LHITS);


                     (d)      produce the 'balance snapshot report' and complete all mandatory checks, making
                              adjustments to transactions or stock and cash declarations where inconsistencies are
                              identified, or accepting any discrepancies that LHITS identified between its calculated
                              values and those from the declarations; and


                     (e)      confirm in LHITS that they wished to roll-over the Stock Unit to the next CAP.


         4.7.6       Any loss or gain that was identified through this process must be either posted to the
                     Suspense Account (pending a correction to the system or an agreement to repay the
                     amount) or had to be corrected by the SPM adding funds to the till (if a loss) or removing
                     funds from the till (if a gain)44.


         4.7.7       The posting of discrepancies to the Suspense Account was only made once the Stock Unit
                     had rolled over to the next CAP45.


         4.7.8       Once all Stock Units have been balanced and rolled-over an SPM would produce the Cash
                     Account report for the branch, which would summarise the position across all Stock Units.




42        After the IMPACT change was implemented the screen would have shown the TP and BP, as CAP was no longer used.

                     The SPM would check this report and if they were happy with this would roll over the branch
                     to the next CAP.


         4.7.9       Whilst this is not intended as a comprehensive list of the tasks an SPM was required to
                     undertake to roll-over, it is intended to provide an overview of what steps were followed as
                     part of roll-over and provides the context for the process of checking that receipts and
                     payments matched.


         4.7.10      The Stock Unit balancing process consists of accumulating all the receipts for the Stock Unit
                     and all the payments for the Stock Unit in the period for which the report is being produced
                     and ensuring that the total value of receipts matches the total value of the payments. When
                     this state is reached, the stock unit is said to be 'balanced'46.


         4.7.11      I understand the definitions of payments and receipts to be:


                     (a)     Payment: "... a transaction resulting in a payment to the customer (for example,
                             Alliance & Leicester Giro withdrawals, National Savings withdrawals, Co-op cheque
                             encashment)"47 "Customer Payments"); and


                     (b)     Receipt: "... a transaction resulting in a payment from the customer (for example, an
                             MVL, TV Licence, Alliance & Leicester Giro deposit, Insurance)"48 ("Customer
                            Receipts").


         4.7.12      Ordinarily it is not intuitive that payments and receipts should match one another, however
                     it is my understanding that the balancing of payments and receipts factored in the cash and
                     stock balance at the start of a CAP (the so-called "brought forward balance") as well as
                     the cash and stock balance at the end of a CAP (the so-called "carried forward balance").


         4.7.13      Payments and Receipts balancing also factors in remittance (remming) activity, revaluations
                     of stock and internal transfers made between Stock Units.


         4.7.14      The balance equations for a Stock Unit are therefore49:


                     (a)     Receipts = Customer Receipts + Transfers In + Remittances In + Revaluations Up


                     (b)     Payments = Customer Payments + Transfers Out + Remittance Out + Revaluations
                             Down


                     (c)    Total Receipts = Receipts + Brought forward balance


                     (d)    Total Payments = Payments + Carried forward balance

          4.7.15     The process of reconciling payments and receipts is perhaps best explained through an
                     illustration using a simplified and fictional payments and receipt account for a specific Stock
                     Unit and CAP, in this example Stock Unit AA and CAP15. Note that in this example all
                     transactions are settled for cash.

          4.7.16     There are a few important assumptions I have made as part of this example:


                     (a)      the 'brought forward balance' is obtained from the LHITS, based on the agreed
                              position when the SPM rolled over from CAP14 into CAP15.


                     (b)      the 'carried forward balance' is calculated by the LHITS based on the manual cash
                              and stock declarations made by the SPM at the end of CAP15 and any discrepancies
                              they accepted as part of the processS1.


                     (c)      the payments and receipts are those that have been recorded in the LHITS by the
                              Clerks; and

                   (d)       as the purchase of stamps by a customer is a purchase of stock, then the item needs
                             to appear as both a receipt of cash and a payment (representing the value of the
                             stamps 'paid' to the customer).


         4.7.17    In this example the total for the Receipts (£5,930) matches that for Payments (£5,930) so
                   this Stock Unit is balanced and can therefore be rolled-over without the need for further
                   action.


         4.7.18    The format of an actual Stock Unit Balance Report produced by LHITS is somewhat different
                   as it was, for example, produced on the Tally printer and is therefore a sequential list, rather
                   than a table.

5.       ICL Pathway's error logging and remediation

5.1      Organisational design

          5.1.1    As part of the incident management process for Legacy Horizon, ICL Pathway utilized a
                   Fujitsu proprietary call management system for logging errors and defects. The system,
                    known as PinICL, was created from another ICL custom program with changes made at the
                   request of ICL Pathway. PinICL was accessible to all Pathway members and used from 1996
                   to 2003, prior to the PEAK system being introduced.


          5.1.2    Internal issues were raised directly into PinICL. These could have been identified during
                   testing or routine monitoring of the system by ICL Pathway. POCL could also raise incidents
                   that they themselves found or which could have come from feedback from SPMs. External
                   users, SPMs, who experienced issues would contact the Horizon Systems Helpdesk ("HSH")
                   who log the incident via their own dedicated system ("PowerHelp"). If the issue was
                    deemed necessary for escalation, it would then be recorded in PinICL.


          5.1.3    The HSH was the first line of support and were responsible for recording the details of the
                   incident, diagnosing the problem and attempting to resolve the issue. If the HSH was unable
                   to resolve the problem, the incident would be routed to a second level support group called
                   the System Management Centre ("SMC").


          5.1.4    The SMC would determine if the incident was a software code problem. If the problem was
                   a known error, the SMC would determine if there was a workaround recorded in the KELs.
                   If so, the workaround was communicated to the customer. If no workaround was available,
                   the SMC ensure there were no duplicate calls for the same problem. If a duplicate call was
                   identified this incident would be attached to the existing duplicate call. If no duplicate
                   incident was identified, and the incident was identified to be a software code problem, the
                   SMC would follow internal procedures and route the call to the System Support Centre
                   ("SSC"), considered third level support. Hardware issues were generally not routed to the
                   SSC, although exceptions to this rule exist.


          5.1.5    The SSC was responsible for resolving the incidents promoted by the SMC.           This was
                   recorded in the PinICL system. The maintenance of PinICLs was the responsibility of the
                   SSC through resolution and closure with communications passed back to PowerHelp. If
                   additional evidence was required, the SMC would be engaged to gather the evidence.


          5.1.6    The SSC was tasked with resolving any incidents to the best of their ability and then passing
                    back the resolution to the SMC. The SSC would triage the incident to determine what other
                   internal development groups were needed to resolve the incident.         Once incidents were
                   resolved, communications back to the SMC were provided.           The SSC also assisted in
                   maintaining the KELs.


          5.1.7    In the event the SSC needed assistance from third party vendors, they escalated calls to
                   "4th line support" which dealt with technology from outside suppliers. The "4th line support"
                   was also responsible to the SSC in terms of updating PinICLs and entering resolutions into

                   the KEL database. They ensured fixes or workarounds have been tested prior to passing to
                   the SSC.


5.2      PinICLs and PEAKs

          5.2.1    Each incident logged in the PinICL system is referred to as a PinICL.          As noted above,
                   sometime in 2003 ICL Pathway began using the PEAK system for incident management and
                   thereafter each logged incident was referred to as a PEAK. There appears to be no significant
                    difference in content between a PinICL and a PEAK. The only difference is the PEAK system
                   was a web-based system and utilized Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).


          5.2.2    As new PPs are logged by a Team Member ("TM") they are assigned a unique reference
                   number. Additional attributes are captured such as who logged the PP, when it was opened,
                   the last update date, open/closed status, summary of the issue, and product group.              If
                   available, information is captured relating to work packages, fixes, other PPs to reference, etc.


          5.2.3    The body of a PP is chronological and typically begins with the TM describing the issue that
                   was identified, assigning a call priority, call type, estimated completion date, and routing to
                   a Team Leader ("TL"). The TL reviews the call, provides approval or rejection (return to TM
                   for further action or close if not valid) then routes the call back to the relevant TMs as defined
                    by the products being impacted.


          5.2.4     When a TM received a PP, they attempted to diagnose the error and identify a fix. If more
                   information was required, they would request additional evidence when needed to recreate
                   the incident. TMs also checked KELs to ensure that the incident was not already addressed.


          5.2.5    Calls were passed between TMs as they diagnosed the issue and attempted to resolve it. Often
                   this would be represented with an update to a Response Category recorded within the PP.


5.3      KELs

          5.3.1    ICL Pathway and Fujitsu maintained a knowledge base of information that included known
                   issues in the Horizon IT System. This knowledge base was referred to as the Known Error
                   Log ("KEL"). Individual entries are referred to as KELs. KELs contain information on how
                   to address or rectify issues that have previously been identified within the Horizon IT
                   System.


          5.3.2    KEL maintenance is the responsibility of both the SSC and "4th line support." They can be
                   referenced during the resolution of a PP. They contain structured attributes such as type,
                   summary, open/closed date, status, and visibility. The body of a KEL contains information
                    covering the symptoms, problems, solutions, and related evidence.

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




6.       Materials provided to me

6.1      Overview

          6.1.1    This section of the Report outlines the documents and data (collectively referred to as
                   "Materials") that I was provided. These materials were provided to me by the Inquiry.


         6.1.2     I characterize the Materials into two categories:


                   (a)    Primary Materials: These relate directly to the period up to and including the Roll Out
                          of the LHITS; and


                   (b)    Background Materials: These provide both background on the LHITS system and
                          processes and procedures.


         6.1.3     In summary, the Primary Materials include:


                   (a)    Extracted IT incident tickets ("PinICL(s)") from Fujitsu's original proprietary call
                          management system ("the PinICL System");


                   (b)    Extracted IT incident tickets ("PEAK(s)") from Fujitsu's successor proprietary call
                          management system ("the PEAK System");


                   (c)    Two archived PinICL databases (in Microsoft Access format) (the "PinICL archive
                          databases");


                   (d)    Extracted records ("KEL(s)") from Fujitsu's knowledge management tool ("the KEL
                          System"); and


                   (e)    A collection of monthly reports prepared by ICLPL in relation to the development and
                          roll-out of the Horizon IT System ("the Monthly Reports").


         6.1.4     I understand that documents from the PinICL System, the PEAK System, the KEL System,
                   and the Monthly Reports were produced by Fujitsu in response to the request submitted to
                   them by the Inquiry.


         6.1.5     The main Background Materials I relied on are those documents referred to in section 4.1.3.


         6.1.6     In addition, the Inquiry directed me towards the following publicly available documents as
                   further Background Materials:


                   (a)    The 'Terms of Reference (updated)' for the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry;


                   (b)    The 'Completed List of Issues' for the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry;

          6.1.7     An inventory of all of the documents I relied on in producing this Report is provided in
                    Appendix A.


6.2      PinICLs and PEAKs


         PinICLs

          6.2.1     The PinICL System was the customised incident logging and resolution tracking system
                    adopted for use by ICLPL to support the Horizon IT System during the period 1996 to 2003,
                    prior to the introduction of the PEAK System in 2003 52.


          6.2.2     Each ticket logged on the PinICL System is referred to as a "PinICL" within my Report.


          6.2.3     PinICLs recorded (amongst other things) incidents:


                    (a)     identified by ICL Pathway in test systems;


                    (b)     identified by ICL Pathway during routine system monitoring;


                    (c)     raised by POCL, some of which may have resulted from feedback received from SPMs;
                            and


                    (d)     resulting from certain calls made to the Horizon System Helpdesk by SPMs, which
                            were deemed necessary for escalation through ICL Pathway's incident management
                            process.


          6.2.4     The standard format of a PinICL is divided into four major sections:


                    (a)     the header which contained summary level information;


                    (b)     the reference table, which contained data points such as customer reference, fast
                            track, and work numbers;


                    (c)     the products table, which contained product groups, product names, and product
                            versions; and


                    (d)     the activities log, which contained the running commentary about the PinICL.

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




          6.2.5     An example PinICL is included in Appendix C.


          6.2.6     There were 56,489 PinICLs produced to me, and all were provided as PDFs.53 The PinICLs
                    provided were opened between 7 July 1996 and 31 December 2000. I understand that
                    Fujitsu chose the upper date limit (31 December 2000) when deciding which documents
                    were responsive to the Inquiry's Rule 9 request. I understand that the PinICL System
                    allowed a user to attach supporting documents to each PinICL, however these supporting
                    documents were not readily available54 and therefore, they were not included as part of the
                    production by Fujitsu.


         PEAKs

          6.2.7     In 2003, ICLPL replaced the PinICL System with the PEAK System. The PinICL System was
                    archived and open tickets from the PinICL System were migrated (transferred) to the PEAK
                    System.


          6.2.8     Each ticket logged on the PEAK System is referred to as a "PEAK" in my Report.


          6.2.9     It is my understanding that the PEAK System served a similar, if not identical purpose, to
                    the PinICL System and therefore the origins of the tickets within it would be much the same
                    as those identified above for the PinICL System. As the function and content of the PinICLs
                    and PEAKs are the same I will refer to these collectively in this Report as "PP(s)".


          6.2.10    The standard format of a PEAK is similar in layout to a PinICL with the main exception being
                    the layout of the activities log.


          6.2.11    An example PEAK is included in Appendix C.


          6.2.12    There were 16,530 PEAK related documents produced in various file formats (HTM, DOC,
                    XLS, BMP, and TXT) 55 .      I understand that the PEAK System allowed a user to attach
                    supporting documents to each PEAK. These documents were produced by Fujitsu.                    This
                    document population represented 13,442 PEAKs and 3,088 supporting documents.


          6.2.13    The PEAKs provided were opened between 29 May 1997 and 31 December 2000.


         Replacement PinICLs and duplicate PinICL/PEAKs

          6.2.14    During the initial review of the PinICLs two observations were made:


                    (a)     An issue with the ordering of the 'Activities' table 56 was identified. This issue meant
                            that it was not possible to easily read the entries within the comments field.


                    (b)     The 13,442 PEAKs were duplicated in the PinICL population.

          6.2.15     These observations were raised with the Inquiry who then communicated them to Fujitsu.
                     Fujitsu responded that:


                     (a)     They had identified 17,537 PinICLs with the ordering issue and subsequently
                             reproduced 17,537 PinICLs.


                     (b)     They recommended I use the PEAK versions.


          6.2.16     None of the 17,537 Replacement PinICLs had duplicate PEAKs versions (i.e., these two
                     document sets were mutually exclusive).


         PinICL archive databases

          6.2.17     In response to queries raised with Fujitsu, two archive databases (in Microsoft Access
                     format) were produced:


                     (a)     'PinArchivel', being a .MDB file; and


                     (b)     'PinArchive2', being a .MDB file.


          6.2.18     Collectively these two databases are referred to as the "PinICL archive databases".


         6.2.19      PinArchivel contained 12 different data tables, while PinArchive2 contained 127 different
                     data tables. Fujitsu confirmed that both databases were archives from the PinICL system,
                     these standalone archives do not share PinICL reference numbers with each other (i.e., the
                     PinICL records they contain are mutually exclusive), and the PDF PinICL documents provided
                     were derived from these databases.


         6.2.20      The PinICL archive databases were received late in my review. I therefore decided, in
                     consultation with the Inquiry team, not to fully investigate the databases as this would have
                     unduly delayed the completion of this Report, which could have had knock-on consequences
                     for the Inquiry's timetable. In addition, I noted that Fujitsu had not produced these PinICL
                     archive databases in response to the original Rule 9 request submitted by the Inquiry in
                     December 2021. Therefore, I deduced the incremental information not to be responsive to
                     the original request from the Inquiry.


         Summary of the PP data used to undertake my review

          6.2.21     The dataset changed over the course of the review as I received multiple copies of the same
                     (or very similar) data across different deliveries. I therefore had to make decisions as to
                     what datasets to use. I also had two analysis workstreams, which were at different states
                     of progression when some of the additional data was provided.                   I decided that these
                     workstreams should, in some cases, use different datasets. The two workstreams were:




57       Fujitsu cited two reasons for this recommendation - (a) PEAK is a live database and will therefore capture any updates
         to the equivalent PinICL record after it was migrated; and (b) Records extracted from the PEAK database also contain
         their attachments as family member documents, where available. No such attachments are readily available in
         relation to records held in the PinICL archive.




                                                                                                                            60

                          (a)       Analytics: This workstream was focused on structuring the PP data using the
                                    Microsoft Azure services so it could be analysed en masse for the entire PP population.


                          (b)       Document Review: This workstream was focused on using industry standard
                                    document review and machine-learning tools, in conjunction with manual document
                                    reviews, to analyse the unstructured components of the data (i.e., the human
                                    generated comments) to identify themes within the PP population.


              6.2.22      This table summarises the PP documents and data that I relied upon as part of my review:

              6.2.23      Neither the Analytics nor the Document Review workstreams used the following documents
                          sets:


                          (a)       Al, as it was agreed with Fujitsu that these contained errors and were therefore
                                    replaced by document set A4;


                          (b)       A2, as it was recommended by Fujitsu that I use the PEAK versions of these,
                                    contained in dataset B1.


              6.2.24      The Analytics workstream solely relied on the PinICL data that was obtained from the Archive
                          PinICL databases (A5), as the objective of this workstream was to structure the data, as


56   This database also contained PinICLs that were opened on or after 01 January 2001.

                        best as possible, before analysing it. The Archive PinICL databases were better structured
                        than the PDF PinICL documents provided, so it was decided to use the databases for this
                        workstream. Owing to the non-standard format of the PEAK attachments these were not
                        used in the Analytics workstream.


             6.2.25     Upon analysis of the contents of the PinICL archive databases it was discovered that all
                        13,442 of the PEAKS were also contained in them, which is consistent with our understanding
                        that these were open PinICLs at the point of migration to the PEAK System. It was decided
                        to use the data from the PinICL archive database for the PEAKS to undertake quantitative
                        analysis, as this was in a readily interrogable format59.


             6.2.26     The Document Review workstream was already well advanced by the time the Archive PinICL
                        databases had been received and analysed. In addition, this workstream required data files
                        to be produced from the Analytics workstream to consolidate the searchable text (principally
                        the 'Comments') into a single text string. For these reasons I decided that the Document
                        Review workstream should continue to use the PDF PinICL documents (datasets A3 and A4)
                        and the HTM PEAK documents (dataset B1) as its data source. In addition, the PEAK
                        attachments (dataset B2) were made available to the reviewers in the Relativity platform.


6.3          Known Error Logs ("KELs")

             6.3.1      The "Known Error Log" was a knowledge management tool used by both ICLPL and Fujitsu
                        to explain how to deal with, or work around, issues that arose in the Horizon IT System.


             6.3.2      It is my understanding that the KEL system was available (in read-only mode) to the
                        following support teams: the Horizon System Helpdesk ("HSH") and the System
                        Management Centre ("SMC"). Only the System Support Centre ("SSC") team were
                        permitted to create new KELs and update existing ones.


             6.3.3      The structure of a typical KEL contains the following sections:


                        (a)    Header: This section contains the meta data for the KEL including the name of the
                               Fujitsu employee who raised it, identifier for the PEAK or PinICL that originated the
                               KEL, version number of the KEL, etc.


                        (b)    Symptoms: This section describes the issues experienced by the SPM in the Horizon
                               IT system.


                        (c)    Problem: This section describes the underlying cause for the symptoms experienced,
                               as diagnosed by the SMC or SSC. This would also be reflected in the underlying PEAK
                               or PinICL.


                        (d)    Solution: This section explains how to deal with, or work around, the issues that
                               arose in the Horizon IT System.




     Checks were performed to compare equivalent records in the PinICL archive database against those from the HTM PEAKS
ss




             documents.




                                                                                                                     62

                   (e)    Evidence: This section generally lists the log files reviewed to investigate the issue(s)
                          and provide the solution(s).


          6.3.4    I note that not all sections are completed in all of the KELs, indicating that not all of the
                   sections were mandatory when creating or updating a KEL. The typical naming convention
                   for the KELs is as follows: <Initials of first name of the Fujitsu employee who raised the
                   KEL><Last name of the Fujitsu employee who raised the KEL><3-4 numbers><A letter>
                   e.g., "SParker538M". A KEL can have multiple versions during its lifecycle. For example, KEL
                   "rcoleman1253j" appears to have two versions.


          6.3.5    An example KEL is provided in Appendix C.


          6.3.6    The term Known Error Log or KEL was replaced in around July 2019 by the term "Knowledge
                   Base" or "KB".


          6.3.7    There were 656 KELs produced in HTM format.


          6.3.8    The KELs provided were opened between the dates of 26 May 1998 and 28 December 2000.


6.4      Management Reports ("MRs")

          6.4.1    105 management reporting documents were produced.


                   (a)    19'Pathway Programme Monthly Reports': These documents summarize the business
                          development activities of the Pathway Programme.


                   (b)    13 'Monthly Joint Implementation Reports': These documents are implementation
                          reports jointly issued by ICL Pathway and POCL.


                   (c)    4 'ICL Pathway Customer Service Reports': These documents contain summaries of
                          the performance of the ICL Pathway Customer Service Business Support Unit.


                   (d)    44 'Pathway Monthly Reports': These documents are comprehensive management
                          reports for ICL Pathway ranging from October 1996 through December 2000. I was
                          not provided reports for every month in this time range. Two Managing Directors
                          were the approval authorities for these reports.      J. H. Bennett was the approval
                          authority up to November 1999; M. Stares was the approval authority beginning in
                          January 2000. They typically cover the following areas:

                   Four of these reports appeared duplicative of other reports in the set; consequently, forty

7.            Pre-processing of documents

7.1           Overview

              7.1.1       This section describes how the source data I received was processed, in preparation for it to
                           be analysed.


7.2           Analytics workstream

              PEAKS and PinICLs

              7.2.1        A DAT file (a structured text file) was provided that served as a manifest for the delivery of
                           PPs and KELs. The original file name acted as the reference number. Additional metadata
                           fields including a custodian field which indicated the report type (e.g., PEAK, PinICL, or KEL).
                          The DAT file also provided parent child relationships which associated supporting documents
                           to their PP.


              7.2.2       The PPs were processed through Microsoft Azure's Form Recognizer ("Form Recognizer")
                           service to organize the components of these reports for further analysis.


              7.2.3        Form Recognizer is an Artificial Intelligence ("Al") service that applies advanced machine
                           learning to transform unstructured documents into actionable datapoints/data sets by
                           extracting text, key value pairs, tables, and structures from documents.


              7.2.4        Form recognizer can accept many different file formats; since the largest portion of delivered
                           documents (PinICLs) were PDFs, it was decided to standardize the PEAKs (and KELs) into
                           PDFs. The PEAKs and KELs were in HTM format.


              7.2.5       The transformation of PEAKs and KELs was accomplished through a series of Python libraries
                           that rendered the HTM files into PDFs.


              7.2.6        Once form recognizer processed a document, the OCRfi" text, key value pairs, table
                           structures, and named entities were returned in a structured text format known as a JSON
                           file. One JSON file was returned for every document put through the form recognizer. These
                           JSON files were then ingested into a Microsoft Azure Databricks repository for further
                           analysis.


              7.2.7       This process was successful for 57,137 documents.            Seven documents could not be
                           processed, despite multiple attempts to reformat the files. They were omitted from further
                           analysis.

7.3      Document Review workstream


         Introduction - Software used to analyse the PPs

          7.3.1     Owing to the number of PPs to be reviewed and their esoteric nature, it was quickly
                    determined that a linear review would be impractical and inefficient. The following industry-
                    standard software platforms were used for the analysis and review of PPs:


                    (a)     Relativity is a market leading document review platform used to display metadata
                            and enable searching and review of documents in an efficient and audited manner.
                            Relativity allows for multiple people to look at documents concurrently and to save
                            decisions in coding fields to classify and group documents accordingly.


                    (b)     Brainspace is an advanced data analytics platform available for investigations,
                            eDiscovery, intelligence mining, and compliance reviews. Brainspace uses machine
                            learning technology to provide information on a set of documents.


         PPs - Document Review Setup

          7.3.2     The documents and the related DAT file were loaded into Relativity for searching and review.
                    Further fields which had not been provided in the DAT file were extracted from the PPs by
                    the Analytics workstream. Additionally, the primary content of the PPs were processed for
                    consumption by Brainspace. This was necessary because the original format of the PPs was
                    not an optimal format for Brainspace to analyse.


          7.3.3     As mentioned above, there were seven PinICLs which were not included in the Brainspace
                    build as their text extraction caused errors.


          7.3.4     In order to facilitate the review of the PPs, a set of Response Categories and Defect Causes
                    were extracted from the following source documents, as described in correspondence
                    received from Fujitsu 61:


                    (a)     Section 15 of the 'PinICL Incident Management Process', dated 30 January 199861


                    (b)     Section 8 of the 'PinICL User Guide', dated 15 February 200063


          7.3.5     Searches were run to identify instances of Response Categories and Defect Causes within
                    documents which were then highlighted in the Relativity document review screen so that
                    they could be easily identified when undertaking manual review, as illustrated here:

         KELs - Document Review Setup

          7.3.6      As with the PPs, the raw data provided by Fujitsu was loaded into Relativity for searching.
                     Based on an initial review of the KEL documents it was decided that analysis in Brainspace
                     would not yield meaningful insight. Relativity was used to undertake a review of the KELs.


         Supervised Learning using Brainspace

          7.3.7      Supervised learning (a type of machine learning) is a process through which Brainspace is
                     provided with examples of relevant and non-relevant documents. Using those examples,
                     the system identifies other documents which are conceptually similar and may also be
                     considered "relevant." This process involves the following steps:


                     (a)      Seed set documents are identified, to include both positive and negative examples of
                              an issue, usually referred to as "Relevant" and "Not Relevant" documents
                              respectively.


                     (b)      A Continuous Multi Modal Learning ("CMML") model is set up within an existing
                              dataset, using the seed set documents which are compared against the rest of the
                              population.


                     (c)      The CMML model assigns a relevance rank to all documents which can be analysed
                              within the population, where the scores depict the following:


                              (i)     Relevance rank 0.0 to 0.4: Documents are likely to be Not Relevant;


                              (ii)    Relevance rank 0.4 to 0.6: The model requires more information to make a
                                      decision on these documents; this is known as the "uncertain zone";


                              (iii)   Relevance rank 0.6 to 0.8: Documents are likely to be Relevant; and


                              (iv)    Relevance rank 0.8 to 1.0: Documents are very likely to be Relevant.


                     (d)      The CMML model continues to be trained through further review of documents and
                              identification of both positive and negative examples




                                                                                                               68

              7.3.8      The model also tracks consistency of review, to identify examples of documents which are
                         inconsistent between how the model believes it should be tagged, and how a reviewer has
                         tagged it.


             Keyword searches using Relativity

              7.3.9     In order for the PPs to be searched with keywords, the Extracted Text field (that is, the body
                         text of the PP) was added into an index using dtSearch; an industry standard search engine
                         used by Relativity.


              7.3.10     Specific keywords were selected to target PPs which were likely to provide examples of a
                         theme, such as searching for the following keywords to identify PPs relating to connection
                         issues experienced:


                         (a)    (network OR isdn OR polling) AND (issue OR error OR failure)


              7.3.11     PPs returned by these keywords were subsequently reviewed and coded where a good
                         example was identified.


7.4          Review Approach


              Monthly Reports

              7.4.1      I reviewed these documents using a manual process. This manual process consisted of
                         reading each document, assessing the information in the document, noting sections that I
                         wanted to revisit, and then organising these notes for further review. I then iterated through
                         the documents again to refine my notes that eventually resulted in the themes and
                         observations documented later in this Report.


             PinICLs and PEAKs (PPs)

              7.4.2      PPs that were identified for review (either by Brainspace's Supervised Learning or Relativity
                         key word searches) were manually reviewed in Relativity. Each PP would be classified as
                         'Relevant' or 'Not relevant' depending on the particular theme that was being investigated.


              KELs

              7.4.3      In order to focus the review of the KELs, an analysis of the PPs was performed. This analysis
                         used a Regular Expression (regex) pattern to identify KEL references within the PPs. A regex
                         is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text.


              7.4.4      This resulted in 1,380 KELs identified in the text of the PPs, only 332 of these were contained
                         within the KELs produced to me.


              7.4.5      In response to my question on the missing KELs, Fujitsu explained, in their correspondence
                         dated 12 August 2022, that some KELs may have been deleted and therefore only the
                         recoverable KELs for the Relevant Period64 were provided.

          7.4.6    The 332 KELs were manually reviewed in Relativity and were classified in two ways according
                   to the element of LHITS that they related to:


                   (a)    Responsiveness: This is a classification of whether the KEL related to a recognised
                           issue in any part(s) of the LHITS. The two different options were:


                          (i)      Responsive: If the KEL did relate to a recognised issue in any part(s) of the
                                   LHITS then the KEL was classified as "Responsive";


                          (ii)     Non-responsive: If the KEL did not relate to an issue with LHITS then the
                                   KEL was classified as "Non-responsive". The scenarios identified were as
                                   follows: the KEL related to identified human errors by branch staff; the KEL
                                   related to a clarification of the exact process required to correctly operate the
                                   Counter system; or it was not possible to determine from the text of the KEL
                                   what the KEL related to.


                   (b)    Nature of the KEL: For responsive KELs this is a classification of the part of LHITS
                           that the KEL related to, or for non-responsive KELs it was the reason the KEL was
                           determined to be non-responsive. The different options for responsive KELs were:


                          (i)      Hardware: A recognised issue with the hardware components of LHITS;


                          (ii)     Software: A recognised issue with the software components of LHITS;


                          (iii)    Download / Synchronisation / Roll-out: A recognised issue with the
                                   synchronisation components of LHITS that exchanges data or updates

8.        SPM training experienced difficulties during National Rollout

          8.1.1      As noted in my theory section, systems raison d'etre is to serve the enterprise's business
                     processes. An important aspect of this endeavour is that the users of these systems
                     understand how they operate. Training is the first step of this educational process. It is
                     apparent from reading the ICL Monthly Reports that there were significant problems in
                     training the SPMs as they adopted the Horizon IT System.


          8.1.2      In addition to the challenge of training users on the Horizon IT System, there was also a
                     challenge of training users on computers in general, as acknowledged publicly by Fujitsu in

                     their case study for the Horizon IT System 65:


                             "Before Horizon can be installed, a great deal of groundwork has to take
                             place. Each Post Office branch is surveyed and prepared, with the new
                             electrical cabling and counter space being installed where necessary.
                             Counter staff receive a        day's training and office managers and
                             subpostmasters attend a one-and-a-half day course, delivered around the
                             country. At the height of automation, over 300 branches were automated
                             per week. Training was provided to 63,000 staff members from the age of
                             16 to 87 with various skills levels (this number includes 2,000 staff
                             members who were over 80 years old). Approximately five thousand calls
                             were received each week by the Helpdesk, due to the Counter staffs' lack
                             of computer experience." (emphasis added).


          8.1.3      As illustrated in the following table, ICL Pathway was aware of the importance of training
                     the SPMs.     They noted early (April 1999) in the national rollout that SPMs were facing
                     difficulties in moving from a paper based balancing process to the automated balancing
                     process resident in the Horizon IT System.            To address this situation, ICL Pathway
                     emphasized the importance of increasing the training available to SPMs. However, as the
                     summer months proceeded, these balancing issues persisted. By the autumn of 1999, a
                     joint report issued by ICL Pathway and POCL acknowledged that training continued to cause
                     major difficulties. These difficulties continued into 2000 resulting in ICL Pathway believing
                     that POCL was so dissatisfied with training (among other issues) that POCL would pursue
                     commercial remedies.


          8.1.4      The following tables contain verbatim extracts from the monthly reports (MRs) and PinICLs
                     and PEAKs (PPs) which I relied on in identifying this theme. I have intentionally not made
                     any corrections to grammar or spelling. Where I deemed it helpful, I have highlighted certain
                     sections in bold. The views expressed in these extracts are that of the authors, being
                     principally ICL Pathway, but in some cases ICL Pathway and POCL.

                                                    balancing process to automated balancing. To address
                                                    this concern improvements in training have been made
                                                    to put a greater emphasis on practical experience in
                                                    balancing. HFSOs, supporting first office balances,
                                                    have received a refresher course with the focus being

                                                    has been extended to two days, with the extra half day
                                                    being used to provide additional time on the topic of

                   Monthly Report -                 to perform reliably. POCL's perception is dominated by

                                                    system replacement was imminent. During September
                                                    the training scheduling system crashed resulting in a

                                                     don't expect them to want to do that, but they can be
                                                     expected to use the 'default' as a lever to force us to

 FUJ00058197       ICL Pathway        December-      A settlement for the projected shortfall in training
                   Monthly Report -   00             courses against the contracted number, arising from
                   December 2000                     low course occupancy levels, has been agreed with the
                                                     Post Office. As part of a package to achieve relaxations
                                                     against existing service SLAs, Pathway will pay the
                                                     first £1M of the training shortfall. Beyond this PON and
                                                     Pathway will share the shortfall equally. Measures to
                                                     improve occupancy levels have been implemented and
                                                     consequently reductions in the estimated shortfall
                                                     have been achieved in each of the last three months.
                                                     Initial occupancy levels in January are also favourable.
                                                     The cost of the projected shortfall has therefore fallen
                                                     from £1.3M to £1M. Efforts continue to improve this
                                                     with the aim of reducing Pathway's contribution. This
                                                     improvement however represents a £300K saving
                                                     compared to last month's financial forecast.


          8.1.5    A review of the PPs reinforces the theme that the SPMs were reporting that the lack of
                   training was problematic in their execution of business activities. Additionally, SSC staff
                   were also raising concerns about the ineffectual nature of training. In these examples, I
                   have emboldened some sections of each entry, but have included wider passages for
                   context.

9.       Hardware issues were problematic during National Rollout

          9.1.1      Failure of hardware components in a system can frustrate users and impede the utility of
                     the system.


          9.1.2      In the national rollout of the Horizon IT System, there was a discrete period (August 1999)
                     where hardware issues rose to the level of being a "serious acceptance incident." According
                     to ICL Pathway's Monthly Reports, some issues persisted through October 1999, but appear
                     to have subsided to acceptable levels by January 2000.


          9.1.3      The following tables contain verbatim extracts from the monthly reports (MRs) and PinICLs
                     and PEAKs (PPs) which I relied on in identifying this theme. I have intentionally not made
                     any corrections to grammar or spelling. Where I deemed it helpful, I have highlighted certain
                     sections in bold. The views expressed in these extracts are that of the authors, being
                     principally ICL Pathway, but in some cases ICL Pathway and POCL.

 FUJ00058185      ICL Pathway      August-99      As anticipated last month, the problems experienced by the
                  Monthly                         live trial outlets with the Epson back office printer 'hanging'
                  Report -                        during the production of the weekly cash account became a
                  August 1999                     serious acceptance incident which is proving extremely
                                                  difficult to resolve.
 FUJ00058186      ICL Pathway      September-99    Another problem, which occurred at the same time, was
                  Monthly                          disk time-outs being reported on the Wigan Correspondence
                  Report -                         Server. This is suspected as a hardware fault and is being
                  September                        investigated as such.
                  1999
 FUJ00058187      ICL Pathway      October-99      298: (Tony H and Dave H) The four week observation
                  Monthly                          period will start on 21/10. (CCN555 has been raised to
                  Report -                         make the observation Cash Account Week integral.) All fixes
                  October                          are available and a tracking document to record progress
                  1999                             set up. On the cut off date of 1/10 the test-sample was
                                                   established as 782 eligible rolled-out outlets representing
                                                   1777 eligible counters. The target is a figure of merit of four
                                                   units per counter per year, a unit being an authorised
                                                   reboot or various numbers of workaround. The CAP 28
                                                   figure result was around five units on a very good trend. For
                                                   CAP29 the result rose to around seven units because of
                                                   376-type issues (see above), new offices not being brought
                                                   up to current software revision levels immediately before
                                                   first use and some offices not yet equipped with fixes for
                                                   printer incidents.
 FUJ00058188      ICL Pathway      November-99    I was very pleased that we were able to meet the
                  Monthly                         demanding reboot levels categorised under acceptance
                  Report -                        incident 298. This was achieved in spite of the serious
                  November                        Energis switch problem which generated a large number of
                  1999                            NT blue screen incidents. The team is now focusing on one
                                                  outstanding counter printer issue, which if resolved, will
                                                  ensure that the level of reboots is well within the long-term
                                                  objectives.

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




10.      Many Post Office branches were disconnected from the
         central system during national rollout.

         10.1.1      The ambition of the LHITS was to allow branches to communicate their information to a
                      central system (the LHITS Campuses, as described in section 4.5). It also allowed for
                      software and reference data updates to be distributed from the campuses to the branches.


          10.1.2     To accomplish this design feature, a telecommunications system was incorporated into
                      LHITS. The telecommunications design depended on ISDN lines (or in some cases satellite
                      links) being installed at each branch with BT and Energis providing the backbone
                      infrastructure to utilize this hardware. It also relied on each branch's equipment to be
                      available for polling (a term that is used when a central system tries to communicate with a
                      remote system, in this case the hardware installed at the branch).


          10.1.3     The Monthly Reports indicate throughout 1998 and 1999 that ICL Pathway was concerned
                      with their ability to effectuate this design feature: they were concerned with BT's coverage
                      of the UK as well as other technical issues related to their standards.


          10.1.4      During the national rollout these problems were realized. Hardware, network availability,
                      and user issues combined to create a situation where ICL Pathway was occupied with a
                      higher-than-expected amount of non-polling branches. This was problematic because the
                      LHITS relied on this telecommunication design aspect to not only to collate and centralise
                      information on all of the activity of the branches, but to also allow for efficient updates of
                      software to the branches.


          10.1.5      Additionally, ICL Pathway was compelled to raise and resolve an issue for any branch whose
                      non-polled status was 24 hours in duration. It is important to understand that this situation
                      included branches who simply powered down their equipment for a day.


          10.1.6     The following tables contain verbatim extracts from the monthly reports (MRs) and PinICLs
                      and PEAKs (PPs) which I relied on in identifying this theme. I have intentionally not made
                      any corrections to grammar or spelling. Where I deemed it helpful, I have highlighted certain
                      sections in bold. The views expressed in these extracts are that of the authors, being

                   Report - March                     increase our implementation costs but have still to find an

                                                      am concerned that BT are failing to implement ISDN

 FUJ00058170     Pathway Monthly    March-98     The inability of the current counter configuration to work
                 Report - March                  with BT's new ISDN standard is of considerable concern.
                 1998                            We are considering proposals for resolving this but in the
                                                 mean-time our ability to deliver operational business
                                                 change is significantly hampered.
 FUJ00058186     ICL Pathway        September-   The expansion of the live estate has meant that the
                 Monthly Report -   99           number of outlets not returning transaction details to TP,
                 September 1999                  due to ISDN problems or simply that the terminal is
                                                 powered down, has increased. This is becoming a job in
                                                 itself to track and resolve. We are obliged under the
                                                 rectification plan for AI376 to raise an incident on each
                                                 office that hasn't polled. This is time consuming and
                                                 probably pointless for those offices only down for 24
                                                 hours. Richard Brunskill is due to talk to the customer
                                                 (with the Requirements team) to try and find a more
                                                 efficient way of tackling this problem.
 FUJ00058186     ICL Pathway        September-   The number of non-polled Post Offices has been increasing
                 Monthly Report -   99           in line with rollout. The task in managing these is
                 September 1999                  increasing and we need to improve the process and root
                                                 cause analysis before we have a significant increase in the
                                                 numbers.
 FUJ00058186     ICL Pathway        September-   A very busy month in the incident management and MIS
                 Monthly Report -   99           areas. We have been dealing with a large number of 'non
                 September 1999                  polled' Post Offices as the live estate has rolled out,
                                                 causing a bottleneck of incidents which we are only now
                                                 beginning to clear. As more offices have become live, the
                                                 demands on the MIS team have increased, as there is a
                                                 need to monitor the performance of the system for the
                                                 acceptance rectification plan. There has also been a
                                                 significant amount of time spent re-working SLAs to
                                                 portray the accurate values for the SRB.
 FUJ00058187     ICL Pathway        October-99   Energis/BT have just informed us that there are many
                 Monthly Report -                more Post Offices which cannot be connected to the ISDN
                 October 1999                    network despite all their previous work over the last three
                                                 years. We are now pressing hard to get a clearer
                                                 understanding of the issue and to work out what a
                                                 resolution plan would need to be.
 FUJ00058187     ICL Pathway        October-99   A fault has been identified in the EICON card which
                 Monthly Report -                supports the ISDN communications protocol. This is
                 October 1999                    seriously impacting our ability to distribute software
                                                 updates to the counters in an efficient manner. It is also
                                                 responsible for generating many unnecessary and long
                                                 calls resulting in additional network charges. We have
                                                 been in contact with the European Service Organisation
                                                 and EICON support in Montreal to help resolve the
                                                 problem quickly.
 FUJ00058188     ICL Pathway        November-    As part of the AI376 rectification plan, MSU presented to

                                                 received from TIP were favourable and they applauded

 FUJ00058188     ICL Pathway        November-    Non-polled offices are still creating a large number of
                 Monthly Report -   99           incidents. MSU are identifying where there is a specific
                 November 1999                   system problem preventing the Outlet from polling.
                                                 However there is still the problem where MSU suspect that

 POL00029222     Monthly Incident   March-00     The most numerous incidents were for the Non-polled
                 Review - March                  incident class, accounting for 245 incidents received or
                 2000                            56.5%. This was followed by "receipts and payments"
                                                 (migration) comprising 140 of all incidents received, or
                                                 32.3%. Please refer to table and reports 3.1 to 3.3 for

                 Monthly Report -                offices has been successful in removing all FADs that were
                 May 2000                        not polled for over 10 days and the effort is now geared to
                                                 get those over 5 days removed.

                 May 2000                        using the revised processes to initiate the resolution of
                                                 problems causing Outlets to fail to poll. Early indications
                                                 show that the number of non-polled Outlets appearing on
                                                 the non-polling report in excess of 5 days is now reducing.

                                                 should give earlier warning of Outlets that have lost

 FUJ00058196     ICL Pathway        November-    The second problem is the increase in the number of post-
                 Monthly Report-    00           offices remaining on the non-polled list. This is mainly due
                 November 2000                   to problems in SMC staffing due to sickness and time
                                                 spent on counter migration activity. A number of

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




11.      Financial concerns were considered by ICL Pathway
         throughout the time period reviewed

         11.1.1    ICL Pathway is a profit seeking entity. I assume that ICL Pathway was motivated to deliver
                   the system and make a profit.


          11.1.2   The ICL Pathway Monthly Reports had two sections ('Commercial and Financial Report';
                   'Business Development Report') that assessed how the Horizon project was tracking against
                   internal financial goals and how the Horizon project could be used for other commercial
                    pursuits.


          11.1.3   The financial success of the Horizon IT System relied on ICL Pathway orchestrating many
                    different constituencies: sponsors, suppliers, and their many internal groups. Benchmarks
                   relating to acceptance, the timing of rollout coverage, and adherence to SLA requirements
                   were topics of discussion as they were directly connected to revenue, cost, and profit
                   realisation. The balancing act between operational and technical activities and their financial
                   ramifications was highlighted in the April 1998 report: "Should the pressures mount, the
                   temptation to hold to NR2 dates at all costs is immense. If we were to (purely theoretically)
                    compromise NR2 quality in order to hold the timescales, we would almost certainly be worse
                   off in the long run."


          11.1.4   Acceptance was achieved on 24 September 1999, triggering the first invoice to be issued by
                   ICL Pathway. The rollout coverage incentive for 1,800 outlets was achieved on 5 November
                   1999. The first payment (F-105 million) was received in early December 1999.


          11.1.5   The items I have included in this table illustrate some financial wins and some financial
                   losses from ICL Pathway's perspective.       Financial concerns were weighed against the
                   resource allocations to deliver the Horizon IT System. It is my opinion that the financial
                   aspects of delivering the Horizon IT System affected the decision-making process.


          11.1.6   The following table contains verbatim extracts from the monthly reports (MRs) which I relied
                   on in identifying this theme. I have intentionally not made any corrections to grammar or
                   spelling. Where I deemed it helpful, I have highlighted certain sections in bold. The views
                   expressed in these extracts are that of the authors, being principally ICL Pathway, but in
                   some cases ICL Pathway and POCL.




                                                                                                               89

 FUJ00058160     Pathway Monthly       February-97      We have issued the next full risk report on the
                 Report - February                      programmed and this now includes not just the high
                 1997                                   level risks but the comprehensive analysis of all known
                                                        risks. This at a high level shows that we start the year
                                                        with some £80m worth of risk and that if we pursue our
                                                        mitigation actions as currently defined, we can bring
                                                        this down to £27m by the end of this year. There is the
                                                        management view that there is scope within this to be
                                                        more aggressive in reducing risks and this will be driven
                                                        through during Q2, Q3 this year.
 FU300058161     Pathway Monthly       March-97         The Change Control process is now underway. Suppliers
                 Report - March                         have been given planning data from which to assess the
                 1997                                   impacts of the delays. The Suppliers Forum has been
                                                        notified of the solid state of the Replan and committed
                                                        itself to facilitating the changes. However, the
                                                        indications are that we will come under pressure to
                                                        recompense suppliers for moneys lost today, never
                                                        mind the claw back in eight years time. As predicted
                                                        last month, this is likely to be a tough round of
                                                        negotiations.
 FUJ00058166     Pathway Monthly       December-97      Holding our suppliers is becoming increasingly costly
                 Report - December                      and fraught for them and our own people who have to
                 1997                                   deal with them. We must strike a balance between
                                                        saving money and keeping core programme
                                                        capability intact. On the one hand, we must resist
                                                        paying people simply to stand by and filling warehouses
                                                        with equipment we do not need for another year. On
                                                        the other, we cannot afford to throw away supplier
                                                        goodwill or make life impossibly difficult for our own

 FUJ00058166     Pathway Monthly       December-97      We declared our contractual position formally on 19th
                 Report - December                      December. In short, we have said that to compensate
                 1997                                   us for the programme delays we require either:
                                                        o A 30% price increase, or
                                                        o A 5% price increase plus a 5 year extension of term.
 FUJ00058169     Pathway Monthly       February-98      We are now in major dispute with POCL on the
                 Report - February                      condition of their physical estate. This has been building
                 1998                                   up for over a year and we now have facts and figures to
                                                        substantiate the argument that the total cost for
                                                        putting their estate into a fit purpose for automation is
                                                        on the wrong side of £40m. They appear to have
                                                        provided no budget for this, yet their contribution needs
                                                        to be close on to £20m.

 FUJ00058171     Pathway Monthly       April-98         NR2 versus NR2+: Should the pressures mount, the
                 Report - April 1998                    temptation to hold to NR2 dates at all costs is
                                                        immense. If we were to (purely theoretically)
                                                        compromise NR2 quality in order to hold the
                                                        timescales, we would almost certainly be worse
                                                        off in the long run. We are only allowed 11 high or
                                                        medium severity Acceptance faults in total: if we fall
                                                        foul of Acceptance, we will have to do remedial work
                                                        and go round the loop all over again: the delay would
                                                        be greater than if we had got it right first time. Unless
                                                        NR2 is truly scalable it will need to be replaced very
                                                        quickly. If we push too much work out of NR2 into 2+,
                                                        the time gap between 2 and 2+ will inevitably increase.
                                                        Having NR2 available early but with a dependency on a
                                                        rapid follow-on NR2+ does us no good whatever. There
                                                        is no point starting rollout unless we know we can keep
                                                        it going: start/stop/start would kill us.
 FUJ00058173     Pathway Monthly       May-98           The design and build cost profile of the business case
                 Report - May 1998                      has deteriorated further as a consequence of the cost
                                                        increases, placing further demands on additional
                                                        funding. Submissions are being prepared to secure
                                                        these. The Treasury review will play in.
 FUJ00058158     Pathway Monthly       August-98        We continue to underspend forecast because of
                 Report - August                        recruitment lag. In August, the underspend was Elm
                 1998                                   out of £10m. That saves us money in the short term
                                                        but means we are not consuming the work at the
                                                        required rate.
 FUJ00058158     Pathway Monthly       August-98        The cost to date of putting back the programme in
                 Report - August                        terms of subcontractor settlements now runs into many
                 1998                                   £m's. We have budgeted for more to come over the
                                                        next 18 months.
 FUJ00058198     Pathway Monthly       December-98      We have also included within our business plan
                 Report- December                       contingency funds to cover the critical known risks. The
                 1998                                   single largest of these is any risk or delay to the

                                                        contingency plans are an essential component of Risk

 FUJ00058187     ICL Pathway           October-99       The 'upside' roll out target of 1800 post offices was
                 Monthly Report -                       achieved on 5th November, enabling us to invoice the
                 October 1999                           higher figure of £90m. rather than the alternative Of
                                                        £80m for 1600 post offices. An invoice for the
                                                        £105,162,500 including VAT was couriered to POCL on
                                                        Monday 8th November, and POCL's confirmation of
                                                        receipt was received on 9th November. Payment is due
                                                        on 5th December, which is another Sunday.
 FUJ00058187     ICL Pathway           October-99       As doubtless reported elsewhere by my colleagues,
                 Monthly Report -                       there has been intense activity on the post Acceptance/
                 October 1999                           pre January roll out decision front, and this will intensify
                                                        further in the run up to 24th November and beyond.
                                                        Reference data is the big issue. Some resolutions must
                                                        be found before roll out can safely restart on 24th
                                                        January. As a measure of the exposure, we face a claim
                                                        from POCL (which we are disputing on the grounds that
                                                        they authorised it) of some £300k in respect of just one
                                                        reference data error.
 FUJ00058189     ICL Pathway           January-00       £105m payment for the full first Roll-out milestone was
                 Monthly Report -                       received on time in early December.

 FUJ00058191     ICL Pathway           May-00           Weekly service performance is a key issue and recent
                 Monthly Report -                       problems with Help Desk service have significantly
                 May 2000                               dented PO confidence. March and April were disastrous
                                                        months on OSD service levels, driven by major
                                                        resource issues (staffing levels) on the Horizon System
                                                        Help Desk. Nearly all Of the SLA's have been missed
                                                        and significant penalties incurred. This is an own goal
                                                        and should have been prevented. As reported last
                                                        month it is on Red Alert and OSD have reacted
                                                        decisively and professionally to implement corrective
                                                        action. Their management has been changed and over
                                                        40 new help desk staff recruited along with a plan to
                                                        recruit at a pace to handle the weekly increase in Post
                                                        Offices and to cover for attrition. This has driven a
                                                        dramatic improvement and this week we are now back
                                                        on target with 7 of the 10 key SLA's. The sensitivity of
                                                        this situation cannot be overstated. It is highly visible
                                                        and has brought firm reaction from PO Directors. It will
                                                        take week on week, month on month good performance
                                                        to recover our position.
 FUJ000S8195     ICL Pathway           October-00       Weekly service performance remains a key issue and
                 Monthly Report -                       although we are back on track and demonstrating
                 October 2000                           consistent performance we are missing some of the
                                                        very challenging SLA's: As expected PO have now
                                                        placed us in formal Breach of Contract (they can do this
                                                        if we miss any three quarters in 24 months) although
                                                        they currently appear to be genuinely seeking
                                                        contractual compliance rather than financial
                                                        recompense. A meeting is fixed for mid November with
                                                        the customer to try and finalise a way ahead on this.
                                                        My concern is that we have breach and termination
                                                        hanging over us on an ongoing basis. Also that we
                                                        establish a methodology that avoids the withholding of

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




12.      The tenuous relationship between ICL Pathway, their
         sponsors (BA and POCL) and suppliers were often topics of
         concern for ICL Pathway's management team

         12.1.1    ICL Pathway dealt with many different groups during the design, development, and
                    deployment of the Horizon IT System. Throughout this period, I noted that ICL Pathway
                   had recurring communication and expectation management concerns with these groups.


          12.1.2   Early in the process (1997) ICL Pathway's interactions focused mainly on sponsors. It is
                    clear from the March 1997 entry that ICL Pathway believed much of the responsibility for
                    preparing the branches for automation lies with the Post Office network itself. This indicates
                   an initial mismatch in the expectations of the Horizon project.          ICL Pathway was not
                    comfortable with the Post Office network's position on its readiness.


          12.1.3   The timeline slippage also concerned ICL Pathways' suppliers, who had invested in
                   equipment and were now told they need to keep this inventory longer than expected.


          12.1.4   Continuing the timeline slippage motif, August 1997 saw the three partners (ICL Pathway,
                   POCL and the Benefits Agency ("BA")) experiencing damage to their business cases. At this
                    point ICL Pathway speculated that POCL and BA might be considering alternatives.


         12.1.5    In February 1998, ICL Pathway's difference of opinion with POCL about counter space
                    problems rose to the level of sending "legal letters."


         12.1.6    In May 1998, ICL Pathway predicted more supplier issues over the summer due to
                    cumulative delays in the timeline.


         12.1.7    In December of 1998, ICL Pathway and POCL targeted August 1999 for national rollout. In
                   January 1999, BA "unilaterally" pushed out their timeline by six months. ICL Pathway and
                   POCL represented against this decision, "some of it quite legal in nature".


         12.1.8    In April 1999, BA (DSS) removed themselves from the Pathway project.


         12.1.9    In May 1999, ICL Pathway found itself needing to "rebuild customer relations following the
                   traumatic arrangements that brought the new contract into force".


         12.1.10   In June 1999, ICL Pathway indicates that POCL still harbour negative feelings toward them,
                    believing that POCL blames ICL Pathway for the way POCL has been treated publicly.


         12.1.11   In October 1999, POCL accused ICL Pathway of resorting to undue escalation related to
                   addressing reference data issues.


         12.1.12   These relationships needed to maintain a healthy hygiene of clear communication and
                   orchestrated manoeuvring as issues presented themselves. It is my opinion that at several
                    points in time, the parties' individual goals and expectations were at odds with each other.
                   This diversion of focus could not have benefited the implementation of the Horizon IT
                   System.

                    on in identifying this theme. I have intentionally not made any corrections to grammar or
                    spelling. Where I deemed it helpful, I have highlighted certain sections in bold. The views
                    expressed in these extracts are that of the authors, being principally ICL Pathway, but in
                    some cases ICL Pathway and POCL.

 FUJ00058161    Pathway         March-97        As we survey the first 200 offices the extent of this problem
                Monthly                         is becoming clearer and worse. We have formally lodged with
                Report -                        PDA that the Post Office network is not fit for the purpose of
                March 1997                      automation and that this responsibility clearly lies with the
                                                sponsor. Difficult negotiations must be anticipated.
 FUJ00058162    Pathway         June-97         The programme review has been presented to PDA, POCL,
                Monthly                         BA, ITSA and SSA [Northern Ireland]. The consistent
                Report -                        response has been one of disappointment and shock that yet
                June 1997                       another slippage has come to the surface so soon after two
                                                previous replans.
 FUJ00058162    Pathway         June-97         We have fully briefed our principle suppliers on the current
                Monthly                         position and not surprisingly this causes many of them
                Report -                        serious problems particularly where they have invested in
                June 1997                       equipment, resources and capability against a plan which has
                                                moved smartly to the right. Different mitigation actions are
                                                called for with different suppliers but this will be a rough task
                                                to get straightened out before we can move forward with
                                                confidence.
 FUJ00058163    Pathway         August-97       This has been another difficult month for Pathway, BA and
                Monthly                         POCL. There have been further programme delays and
                Report -                        difficulties with Release 1c and the potential release date for
                August 1997                     Release 2. This has caused further damage to the business
                                                cases of all parties and within the Sponsors there is a body
                                                of people who are pressing and looking for a way out the
                                                contract.
 FUJ00058163    Pathway         August-97       We know that the BA and POCL business cases have been
                Monthly                         badly damaged and that there are elements within both
                Report -                        organisations which are now looking for out or at least are
                August 1997                     thinking about alternatives. BA will maintain that they have
                                                not slipped since the last replan in April (CCN105):
                                                essentially true as far as we can tell.
 FUJ00058163    Pathway         August-97       Another very difficult month for the programme. There is no
                Monthly                         disguising the perception that we are in the dock for the
                Report -                        latest slippage and the fact that the damage to business
                August 1997                     cases all round is immense. On the plus side, our new
                                                openness and realism about the state of the programme has
                                                been met with a positive response from the other side and a
                                                preparedness to work with us to find a way through.
 FUJ000S8169    Pathway         February-98     The counter space problem has been better defined and is
                Monthly                         more serious than we had previously thought. We have gone
                Report -                        on the attack with legal letters, which make it clear that,
                February                        beyond a certain point, we consider this to be a matter for
                1998                            POCL to face up to (and pay for). The current prognosis for
                                                an early and amicable resolution is not good. Meanwhile, we
                                                need to be even more creative and determined to find ways
                                                to address the problem (moneys aside).

 FUJ00058173    Pathway        May-98         More supplier tensions are probable over the summer.
                Monthly                       Cumulative delays are testing their patience and they are
                Report -                      increasingly looking for near term cash returns.
                May 1998
 FUJ00058198    Pathway        December-98    The key event is the start of National Roll-out, since this is
                Monthly                       the time when we begin to implement the critical
                Report-                       infrastructure in the Post Office Network and on the
                December                      completion of this, then the revenue flows to ICL-Pathway
                1998                          begin in earnest. We and Post Office Counters Ltd are in
                                              agreement that August 1999 is the appropriate date to start
                                              National Roll-out with sufficient contingencies to cover the
                                              likely problems we will encounter. We believe that National
                                              Roll-out can begin in early August, where as POCL view that
                                              it is more likely to be the last week in August. We continue
                                              to press for a more aggressive plan to avoid any
                                              unnecessary delay to this activity.
 FUJ00058168    Pathway        January-99     All plans work towards a National Roll-out date for NR2 in
                Monthly                       August 1999. Nevertheless there has, during the last two
                Report -                      weeks, been a major confrontation with the Benefits Agency
                January                       who have abruptly and unilaterally moved their multi-benefit
                1999                          Model Office plans by six months. Following strong
                                              representation from ourselves and POCL some of it quite
                                              legal in nature, DSS have become defensive and attempt to
                                              retreat on the issue. Nevertheless the issue remains untidy,
                                              could lead to press leaks and needs rapid and complete
                                              resolution. This will need to be watched extremely carefully.
 FUJ00058182    ICL Pathway    May-99         We need a major programme to re-build customer relations
                Monthly                       following the traumatic arrangements which brought the new
                Report -                      contract into force. We have a substantial way-to go on this
                May 1999                      with POCL before this contract is in good order.
 FUJ00058182    ICL Pathway    May-99         The withdrawal of DSS from the Agreements removed seven
                Monthly                       of the 25 Acceptance areas. In addition Horizon has indicated
                Report -                      that a further area will not now be pursued. The DSS
                May 1999                      withdrawal has also removed the two Acceptance
                                              Specifications that DSS and POCL refused to approve, and
                                              several of the issues that were previously a concern.
 FUJ00058183    ICL Pathway    June-99        Although we are now some six weeks into the new contract
                Monthly                       arrangements POCL continue to remain negative and critical
                Report -                      towards the programme and have not yet got over their
                June 1999                     bitterness on the way they have been treated within the
                                              public sector, for which unfortunately they continue to hold
                                              us partially to blame. We have to work at this as we make
                                              progress with the commercial, financial and programme
                                              matters in order to find a more positive and long term
                                              relationship.
 FUJ00058187    ICL Pathway    October-99     We were unable to convince POCL of our case over reference
                Monthly                       data without resorting to what POCL regarded as undue
                Report -                      escalation. That went down badly and caused a negative
                October                       reaction. The right actions now appear to be underway but
                1999                          we need to establish new conduits for better day to day
                                              communication and step-by-step escalation'. The actions
                                              have Operations leading, with Programmes in support: this is
                                              a significant change which calls for changes in the ways we
                                              do things internally as well as between ourselves and POCL.
 FUJ00058189    ICL Pathway    January-00     We must keep pushing for a joined up campaign internal to
                Monthly                       Post Office to promote Horizon. There are far too many
                Report -                      misconceptions about which vary from out-of-date
                January                       technology to a batch system to "it will take 3/4 years to
                2000                          complete roll-out."

 FUJ00058190    ICL Pathway      February-00   There were no Network incidents requiring Energis
                Monthly                        involvement during the reporting period. However there have
                Report -                       been occasional incidents at Post Offices that are taking too
                February                       long to resolve. A letter of complaint has been sent and a
                2000                           meeting is planned with Energis and BT in order for both to
                                               explain their lack of action.
 FUJ00058192    ICL Pathway      June-00       On a broader front in the Post Office, business is proving
                Monthly                        difficult and ICL is not seen as a strategic supplier in Parcel
                Report -                       Force nor Royal Mail. We are still tarnished with the history.
                June 2000                      Our PC Supply contract has hit severe difficulties this month
                                               with supply issues from MVC and PO have expressed major
                                               dissatisfaction.
 FUJ00058194    ICL Pathway      August-00     There are some supplier issues also
                Monthly                        •   Flat screen quality - Optoma have produced a firmware
                Report -                           mod but site visits are required - there is bound to be a
                August 2000                        fight over costs (estimated at circa £1m)
                                               •   Ntl final payment - £800k claim of which we judge
                                                   perhaps 25% to be fair
                                               •   KPL - our claim in respect of wasted course places (as
                                                   above - their share could amount to £400k)
                                               •   Celestica - mobiles cost- £130k disputed cost hike
 FUJ00058195    ICL Pathway      October-00    We have invoked Masons to write to ntl: to knock them back
                Monthly                        from their £800k claim for standby charges. We feel strongly
                Report -                       that their claim should be more like £250k. Our action may
                October                        provoke some reaction because ntl: are a strategic customer.
                2000                           We will also be writing to Energis to claim back costs which
                                               have resulted from what we assert were their breaches of
                                               contract with respect to ISDN line installations.

                Report -                       challenging SLA's and as expected PO have placed us in
                December                       formal Breach of Contract (they can do this if we miss any
                2000                           three quarters in 24 months). We are trying to negotiate a

                                               up the training occupancy issue. A proposal is currently being
                                               considered by the Post Office and we appear to be homing in

                Report -                       ongoing. An offer of £50K has been received and rejected on
                December                       the basis that it is a significant under estimation by Energis
                2000                           of the costs incurred.

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




13.      The persistence of reference data mismanagement degraded
         the integrity of Horizon

         13.1.1       ICL Pathway designed the Horizon IT System to utilise data driven logic.         This design
                      feature's benefit was to efficiently update the Horizon IT System's functionality without the
                      need to develop, design, test, and deploy new versions of the software.


          13.1.2      POCL was responsible for maintaining portions of the Horizon IT System's Reference Data.
                      Reference Data maintained pricing information for the different types of stock sold at the
                      branches. It also contained behind-the-scenes information that was needed by the Horizon
                      IT System to map accounting transactions properly.


          13.1.3      The advantages of data driven logic rely upon its custodianship. If the "data" in the data
                      driven logic is not timely, accurate, and complete, the system it supports will not operate as
                      intended.


          13.1.4      In early 1997, ICL Pathway identified the need to incorporate POCL's Reference Data into
                      the Horizon IT System. By late 1997, ICL Pathway characterised its contractual obligations
                      regarding Reference Data as "poorly defined" but acknowledged the significance of the issue
                      as crucial.


          13.1.5      The Pathway Monthly Reports clearly represent that ICL Pathway believes the maintenance
                      of some of the Reference Data is the responsibility of POCL.       These same reports also
                      describe a litany of instances where, according to the ICL Pathway reports, POCL failed in
                      this responsibility. The resulting Reference Data issues caused errors in the Horizon IT
                      System.


          13.1.6      The following tables contain verbatim extracts from the monthly reports (MRs) and PinICLs
                      and PEAKs (PPs) which I relied on in identifying this theme. I have intentionally not made
                      any corrections to grammar or spelling. Where I deemed it helpful, I have highlighted certain
                      sections in bold. The views expressed in these extracts are that of the authors, being
                      principally ICL Pathway, but in some cases ICL Pathway and POCL.

 FUJ00058160       Pathway Monthly     February-97     There is potential issue concerning the acquisition and
                   Report -                            distribution of BPS Reference Data. It needs to join the
                   February 1997                       POCL Reference data stream at some point.
 FUJ00058166       Pathway Monthly     December-97     Reference data is poorly defined in the contractual
                   Report -                            requirements but is crucial for the proper control of
                   December 1997                       changes to outlet/product data. POCL are only now
                                                       realising its significance and we must be vigilant if we
                                                       are to avoid requirements creep.

 FUJ00058169    Pathway Monthly    February-98     The CARs were brought up to date. I sent a letter
                Report -                           withdrawing our approvals for CARs relating to
                February 1998                      Reference Data. The subsequent muscular
                                                   correspondence has led to a letter to Tony 0 asking him
                                                   to intercede with me on the customer's behalf. This
                                                   issue will either resolve itself with deliveries by POCL of
                                                   satisfactory Reference Data by the end of March or will
                                                   become a severe embarrassment to POCL if they miss
                                                   either or both of the quality or the date.
 FUJ00058170    Pathway Monthly    March-98        As reported in last months report, the focus of attention
                Report - March                     is now the main pass stages of BPS and EPOS system
                1998                               testing. These activities have been seriously impacted
                                                   by a series of problems related to the mapping of
                                                   'reference data to the EPOS counter application. A
                                                   number of corrective actions have been implemented
                                                   and recovery options are now being evaluated. The

                                                   POCL (RDMC & TIP) has gone well and we are now
                                                   poised to start the final stage (i.e. DIT2).
 FUJ00058170    Pathway Monthly    March-98        The last month has not been an easy one for the work
                Report - March                     on New Release 2 planning and progress. Severe
                1998                               problems with EPOSS testing within Pathway and linking
                                                   through to reference data within POCL have caused a
                                                   delay of between three and five weeks to the schedule.
                                                   A mitigation plan has been drawn up although this has
                                                   high risk and low confidence and discussions are now in
                                                   hand with the sponsors to open up the debate on a
                                                   better plan to get to LiveTrial in January 1999. This area
                                                   will remain extremely difficult for some time.
 FUJ00058171    Pathway Monthly    April-98        This has been a busy month to reshape the NR2
                Report - April                     planning to achieve the January Live Trial date, which,
                1998                               due to stress points within EPOSS/Reference Data, has
                                                   meant a moving around of internal milestones and the
                                                   need for all parties to reconnect on a different schedule
                                                   for Model Office testing. The most difficult area here, will
                                                   be with BA who saw the contingency owned more by
                                                   them than by us and are therefore somewhat reluctant
                                                   to co-operate.
 FUJ00058173    Pathway Monthly    May-98          For ICL Pathway the stress points in this plan are the
                Report - May                       satisfactory completion of the EPOSS system testing
                1998                               which has been a difficult area with its tight interfaces to
                                                   the POCL reference data system. In addition we are
                                                   scheduled to enter the direct interface testing of our
                                                   systems with POCLs starting on the 16`h June and
                                                   currently we have a small number of critical software
                                                   fixes to complete.
 FUJ00058174    Pathway Monthly    June-98         We have received updated versions of the Reference
                Report - June                      Data from POCL but the quality is below that expected.
                1998                               Meetings have been arranged with POCL in an attempt
                                                   to resolve these problems before the start of model
                                                   office rehearsals.
 FUJ00058175    Pathway Monthly    July-98         The quality and the change control processes associated
                Report - July                      with POCL reference data is causing a considerable
                1998                               amount of rework for the programme. This is delaying

                                                   Rem'ing in and out, transferring stock between stock
                                                   units and scales functionality. This was diagnosed as the
                                                   office details having a change in the Reference Data
                                                   pipeline that caused a previous change to be released
                                                   with an end date on the data when the actual change
                                                   containing this end date had not been released.
                                                   Although the Rem and scales problems were resolved,
                                                   the stock transfer amendments were not made until
                                                   Monday, which resulted in the number of outlet calls
                                                   raised on that day. A resolution plan is in place to
                                                   ensure there will be no cash account balance problems
                                                   on Wednesday.
 FUJ00058186    ICL Pathway        September-      The performance of delivering reference data is cause
                Monthly Report -   99              for concern. The impact of reference data failure has
                September 1999                     been evident over the past two weeks where recent
                                                   failures have had a major impact at the Post Office
                                                   counter. Given an estate of 20,000 Post Office outlets
                                                   any reference data failure will cause enormous problems
                                                   for the postmaster, the HSH and support teams. The
                                                   end-to-end reference data System needs to be fault
                                                   tolerant - at present it is not.
 FUJ00058187    ICL Pathway        October-99      Too many reference data errors are being distributed to
                Monthly Report -                   the counter. End to end design reviews are being held to
                October 1999                       establish what action can be taken swiftly to prevent
                                                   these occurring in the future. These are having a major
                                                   impact on Acceptance Incident 376. In addition, the
                                                   performance of the data distribution process is
                                                   inadequate and must be improved before roll-out
                                                   commences in late January 2000.
 FUJ00058187    ICL Pathway        October-99      As doubtless reported elsewhere by my colleagues,
                Monthly Report -                   there has been intense activity on the post Acceptance/
                October 1999                       pre January roll out decision front, and this will intensify
                                                   further in the run up to 24th November and beyond.
                                                   Reference data is the big issue. Some resolutions must
                                                   be found before roll out can safely restart on 24th
                                                   January. As a measure of the exposure, we face a claim
                                                   from POCL (which we are disputing on the grounds that
                                                   they authorised it) of some £300k in respect of just one
                                                   reference data error.

 FUJ00058187    ICL Pathway        October-99      We were unable to convince POCL of our case over
                Monthly Report -                   reference data without resorting to what POCL regarded
                October 1999                       as undue escalation. That went down badly and caused
                                                   a negative reaction. The right actions now appear to be
                                                   underway but we need to establish new conduits for
                                                   better day to day communication and 'step-by-step
                                                   escalation'. The actions have Operations leading, with
                                                   Programmes in support: this is a significant change
                                                   which calls for changes in the ways we do things
                                                   internally as well as between ourselves and POCL.
 FUJ00058187    ICL Pathway        October-99      The monitoring of the three big Acceptance Incidents
                Monthly Report -                   (AI298, A1376 and AI408) have all run into difficulties ii
                October 1999                       varying degrees with the common theme being the
                                                   potentially unsafe state of operation of Reference Data
                                                   within the end-to-end model. As mentioned already the
                                                   end-to-end workshop is the critical process for finding
                                                   an acceptable resolution to this complex area.
 FUJ00058187    ICL Pathway        October-99      Too many Reference Data errors are being distributed tc
                Monthly Report -                   the live estate which has been causing major problems
                October 1999                       with reconciliation and cash account production. We are
                                                   pressing for a full end-to-end review across Horizon as
                                                   well as Pathway such that solutions can be found and
                                                   implemented prior to a roll-out restart in January 2000.
 FUJ00058188    ICL Pathway        November-       The "big three" Acceptance issues have been reduced tc
                Monthly Report -   99              the "big two" with the clearance of 298 (Counter
                November 1999                      Stability). Actions have been developed for handling the
                                                   issues on EPOSS Reconciliation and Reference Data
                                                   sufficient to get us to the decision to restart the rollout
                                                   on 24 January. There are new starts on Network
                                                   Banking and Euro study.
 FUJ00058188    ICL Pathway        November-       The third meeting of the Reference Data get-well plan
                Monthly Report -   99              was held last week. Attendees included Keith Baines,
                November 1999                      Tony Qppenheim, Mike Coombs and Martin Riddell. The
                                                   meeting was very positive and hopefully increased the
                                                   onus on POCL to produce specific action plan to address
                                                   data quality issue. Data assumptions document has
                                                   been sent to POCL. CS has received POCL Business
                                                   Rules document and comments have gone back to
                                                   POCL. There is a problem relating to change in passport
                                                   price data received from POCL on 29th November. The
                                                   price change was linked in to other changes for which
                                                   additional work was required and for which we had an
                                                   OLA of 4 weeks. The change is required for 16
                                                   December. There is a risk that we will be unable to
                                                   complete this change for the 16th December. POCL have
                                                   been informed and a response is awaited. SIP 16 data
                                                   has been delivered to all outlets and a selected number
                                                   have been supplied with the code and activated.
                                                   Development work on CP2298, the change to
                                                   RDDS/RDMC is reported to be progressing to plan.

                Monthly Report -                   PO and another from an error in Pathway's systems, it
                January 2000                       was clear that the processes for Reference Data

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




 URN               Title              Date            Extracted Text
 FUJ00058189       ICL Pathway        January-00      There have been a number of problems with the
                   Monthly Report -                   processing of Reference Data in the last two weeks.
                   January 2000                       These include: A number of files were sent to RDMC that
                                                      were thought to be benign to the Horizon system. This
                                                      was not the case as it caused some changes to occur in
                                                      the Horizon counters that may not have been expected.
                                                      The problem was due to POCL failing to supply required
                                                      data to a previous OBC in September 1999 to ensure
                                                      that a change in AP client names was propagated to all
                                                      associated AP tokens. The Reference Data Comparison
                                                      tool successfully identified this problem. A number of
                                                      files were sent to RDMC that contained a change to the
                                                      Cash Account type for both live and non-Live outlets.
                                                      Unfortunately a process issue had allowed these
                                                      changes to he supplied by POCL as Help Desk changes
                                                      only and RDT were also not informed that the files
                                                      contained such data. As a consequence RDT were
                                                      unaware of the urgency with which the files were
                                                      required and had not progressed them for release. The
                                                      problem was further complicated in that some of the
                                                      files had dependencies on others for which RDT were
                                                      awaiting action both from POCL and from ICL Pathway.
                                                      RDT were able to progress the files slightly later than
                                                      required but we believe that this has not caused any
                                                      problems to Live outlets. The underlying cause of the
                                                      problem is being addressed and additional processes are
                                                      being established within POCL to ensure that this does
                                                      not happen in the future. An outlet's FAD code was
                                                      changed in anticipation of-the outlet moving to a new
                                                      location and franchise however the actual change was
                                                      delayed but this was not reflected by POCL within the
                                                      Reference Data. This caused problems for ICL Pathway
                                                      data processing. The immediate problem was overcome
                                                      by provision of corrective Reference Data however the
                                                      underlying issue is still under investigation.
 FUJ00058190       ICL Pathway        February-00     Late delivery of Reference Data or Reference Data
                   Monthly Report -                   Amendments by POCL causes Pathway problems in
                   February 2000                      maintaining the scheduled timescales. A process is
                                                      being. introduced to trigger an E-Mail to POCL QSG
                                                      every time they are. late with these deliveries.
 FUJ00058192       ICL Pathway        June-00         There are still concerns regarding the quality of
                   Monthly Report -                   Reference Data received from POCL, in particular
                   June 2000                          regarding the actual volume of errors and the amount of
                                                      rework resulting from last minute changes. It is difficult
                                                      to identify ownership within POCL to take this forward.
                                                      This is being addressed through the HSRF.
 FUJ00058194       ICL Pathway        August-00       There is concern over the performance of the Data
                   Monthly Report -                   Centre with large volumes of non-core Reference Data
                   August 2000                        remains, even with 64 Agents at CI_4. Changes may
                                                      need to be made to the processing mechanisms. This is
                                                      being monitored.
 FUJ00058196       ICL Pathway        November-       Quality of Reference Data from POCL and time taken to
                   Monthly Report-    00              resolve the problem remains a concern. This has been
                   November 2000                      escalated within POCL.
 FUJ00058197       ICL Pathway        December-00     Quality of reference data remains an issue. Insufficient
                   Monthly Report -                   progress is being made by POCL in this area and has
                   December 2000                      been escalated to BSM.


          13.1.7      A review of the PPs supports the contention that Reference Data was a cause of problems in
                      the Horizon IT System.

                                           under the reference data change in wp 5760 & 5817, that

                                          This had a knock on effect on TIPs calculation of the CAP 29

                                          between 1st and 4th October were incorrectly recorded in the
                                          message store (caused by the deletion of the Transfer reference
                                          data) the values of transferred items of STOCK (not Cash) were

                                           cash settlement was mapped to the CA, but the corresponding

                                           totals was caused by the fact that non-core reference data was

                                           primary mappings for these products these products could not be
                                           mapped to the cash account at stock unit rollover." "All the

          13.1.8      I surveyed the PP population for any Product at Fault value where Reference Data was
                      indicated. I identified the 1,863 PPs in the chart below, whose legend itemizes the Product
                      at Fault values. Reference data problems began manifesting in 1998 and were prevalent
                      during the national rollout period. Interestingly, a Product at Fault value of"POCL Reference

                      portion of the chart. Prior to this period, more generic descriptions are used.

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




14.      The Horizon IT System Helpdesk was often the root of SLA
         issues with POCL

         14.1.1      The HSH was responsible for frontline support to users of the Horizon IT System.
                     Contractually, ICL Pathway's SLA included items regarding the HSH, such as time to answer
                     a call and carrying through with a call (not abandoning it). The ICL Monthly Report discussed
                     the failings of the HSH, in regard to SLA requirements, for a significant amount of the review
                     period. Concerns were first raised in September 1998 and carried through the national
                     rollout. The same issues that triggered SLA concerns also "dented" confidence from POCL.


          14.1.2    In May 2000, ICL Pathway declared an "own goal" based on HSH performance.                  The
                     management team was replaced, and improvements were noted in June 2000.


          14.1.3     The following table contains verbatim extracts from the monthly reports (MRs) which I relied
                     on in identifying this theme. I have intentionally not made any corrections to grammar or
                     spelling. Where I deemed it helpful, I have highlighted certain sections in bold. The views
                     expressed in these extracts are that of the authors, being principally ICL Pathway, but in
                     some cases ICL Pathway and POCL.

                                                        ways in which the service targets could be more

                                                        (Pathway to POCL, and Pathway to OSD). The
                                                        document sets out 18 recommendations for action.
                                                        Legal opinion is that although repeated failure to
                                                        meet the SLAs concerned will nor give grounds for
                                                        termination by POCL, it can hold our feet to the fire
                                                        and suspend the rollout.
 FUJ00058191      ICL Pathway Monthly    May-00         POCL are shaping up to hit us on SLAs and
                  Report - May 2000                     Training. This was predicted for about now on the
                                                        basis that, in the case of help desk metrics, we will
                                                        have failed to meet all criteria for three successive
                                                        quarters. That gives POCL the right to terminate
                                                        the contract. We don't expect them to want to do
                                                        that, but they can be expected to use the 'default'
                                                        as a lever to force us to do better and make
                                                        concessions.
 FUJ00058191      ICL Pathway Monthly    May-00         Weekly service performance is a key issue and
                  Report - May 2000                     recent problems with Help Desk service have
                                                        significantly dented PO confidence. March and April
                                                        were disastrous months on OSD service levels,
                                                        driven by major resource issues (staffing levels) on
                                                        the Horizon System Help Desk. Nearly all of the
                                                        SLA's have been missed and significant penalties
                                                        incurred. This is an own goal and should have been
                                                        prevented. As reported last month, it is on Red
                                                        Alert and OSD have reacted decisively and
                                                        professionally to implement corrective action. Their
                                                        management has been changed and Over 40 new
                                                        help desk staff recruited along with a plan to recruit
                                                        at a pace to handle the weekly increase in Post
                                                        Offices and to cover for attrition. This has driven a
                                                        dramatic improvement- and this week we are now
                                                        back on target with 7 of the 10 key SLA's. The
                                                        sensitivity of this situation cannot be overstated. It
                                                        is highly visible and has brought firm reaction from
                                                        PO Directors. It will take week on week, month on
                                                        month good performance to recover our position.
 FUJ00058192      ICL Pathway Monthly    June-00        As previously reported, weekly service performance
                  Report - June 2000                    is a key issue and recent problems with Help Desk
                                                        service have significantly dented PO confidence.
                                                        However, I am pleased to report that OSD service
                                                        levels are now much improved and we are getting
                                                        back towards a reasonable SLA performance. The
                                                        poor service in Q1 has cost ICLI- over £200K in
                                                        penalties. It is intended to remove the Red Alert
                                                        within the next three weeks once we have
                                                        demonstrated consistent performance. It will take
                                                        week on week, month on month good performance
                                                        to fully recover the confidence of PO Directors.



         14.1.4    Based on my understanding of the content of the PPs, I do not believe any of their content
                   would be relevant to ICL Pathway's helpdesk concerns, and therefore I did not undertake
                   searches of the documents for this theme.

Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




15.      The Horizon SMC was frequently cited for not properly
         filtering calls to the SSC. This lack of filtering delayed the
         SSC from resolving technical problems

         15.1.1       ICL Pathway had an error escalation process. Users that experienced problems with LHITS
                      were first directed to the HSH who logged the incident via PowerHelp.         The SMC was
                      responsible for determining if the problem required the SSC to become involved. If the issue
                      was deemed necessary for escalation to the SSC it would then be recorded in the PinICL
                      system.


          15.1.2      The SSC was responsible for the maintenance of PinICLs.


          15.1.3      The ICL Monthly Reports discuss the topic of the SMC not properly filtering calls.
                      Consequently, the SSC was responsible for resolving an excess of PinICLs. The purpose of
                      the SSC was to resolve technical issues with the LHITS. The fact that the SMC did not filter
                      lower-level issues meant that the SSC was burdened with performing this triage. This extra
                      work delayed the SSC from addressing the true technical issues within the Horizon IT
                      System.


          15.1.4      This problem persisted throughout the national rollout.


          15.1.5      The following tables contain verbatim extracts from the monthly reports (MRs) and PinICLs
                      and PEAKs (PPs) which I relied on in identifying this theme. I have intentionally not made
                      any corrections to grammar or spelling. Where I deemed it helpful, I have highlighted certain
                      sections in bold. The views expressed in these extracts are that of the authors, being

 FUJ00058186    ICL Pathway            September-      The workload pressure on SSC has intensified through
                Monthly Report —       99              September with high volumes of calls being received.
                September 1999                         SSC are struggling to contain the workload: the WIP is
                                                       in three figures. Also a number of additional tasks were
                                                       undertaken to support the resolution of Acceptance
                                                       Incidents. SSC had significant involvement in the
                                                       management and resolution activities for the
                                                       Correspondence Server index corruption problems that
                                                       occurred over the last week of the month. A major
                                                       factor in this is the overall performance of the SMC. A
                                                       pre-scan function is being put in place to ensure that
                                                       calls get the appropriate level of attention, but a
                                                       tougher stance will be taken on "invalid" calls passed
                                                       across by SMC. A RAR has been raised to recruit
                                                       additional resource.
 FUJ00058187    ICL Pathway            October-99      The SSC remains under enormous workload pressure.
                Monthly Report -                       The number of calls received in October was 1123
                October 1999                           (compared with 815 in September and 536 in August).
                                                       Poor filtration at SMC is a major contributor to this
                                                       problem and that aspect is part of the current OSD Red
                                                       Alert. A number of management and working level
                                                       meetings have been held with OSD and although a plan
                                                       to address the SMC failings is expected imminently
                                                       from OSD its appearance seems slow. As a temporary
                                                       measure overtime arrangements are being put in place
                                                       within the SSC to help handle the extra load.
 FUJ00058188    ICL Pathway            November-       Filtration at SMC remains a concern although the
                Monthly Report -       99              implementation of a higher level of checking prior to
                November 1999                          calls being escalated to SSC has certainly helped to
                                                       reduce the flow. A short secondment of one of the key

16.      The SSC was overwhelmed with PPs but was earnest in its
         effort to perform its duties

         16.1.1       The SSC was responsible for the resolution of PPs. The SSC also maintained the KELs. The
                      SSC was tasked with resolving PPs to the best of its ability and then communicating
                      resolutions to the SMC.


          16.1.2      The ICL Monthly Reports often call attention to the workload of the SSC.


          16.1.3      Over the course of reviewing the PPs provided to me for this Report, I recognized the
                      complexity of some of the issues the SSC was responsible for resolving. Throughout the
                      course of my review, most of the entries I read appeared to be written by SSC staff and
                      demonstrated to me that they were earnest in their efforts to resolve these issues.


          16.1.4      The following table contains verbatim extracts from the monthly reports (MRs) which I relied
                      on in identifying this theme. I have intentionally not made any corrections to grammar or
                      spelling. Where I deemed it helpful, I have highlighted certain sections in bold. The views
                      expressed in these extracts are that of the authors, being principally ICL Pathway, but in
                      some cases ICL Pathway and POCL.

          16.1.5      The following figure's line shows the open balance of PPs by day. There are maximums in
                      the autumn of 1997 and the autumn of 1998. There is a noticeable downward trend that
                      produces a minimum in July 1999, followed by a steep rise, cresting in May 2000. This is
                      followed by a moderate reduction through September 2000. The remainder of the data
                      shows another rise until the end of 2000, which is where the PP production ends. The
                      remainder of the figure's line shows how this PP balance is fully closed in November 2002.
                      For the review period, the average open PP balance was almost 1,400. In my opinion, this
                      is a high amount.

              16.1.6      The persistent high balance was a combination of new PPs being raised and the amount of
                           time it took to resolve existing PPs. The following figure shows a distribution of the amount
                           of time to fully close PPs. On average, 43 days were required to close a PP, with almost
                           3,000 PPs requiring more than 180 days to resolve.

17.      Acceptance Incidents were a gating issue to the financial
         success of ICL Pathway. A persisting issue related to Al
         376.

         17.1.1    Acceptance was the term used by ICL Pathway and POCL to indicate the Horizon IT System
                   operated in a manner that was acceptable by POCL. Acceptance Incidents ("AIs") were
                   identified shortcomings of the Horizon IT System that required resolution prior to Acceptance
                    being confirmed by POCL.


         17.1.2    Acceptance was financially significant to ICL Pathway.        ICL Pathway was paid once
                   Acceptance was achieved. It received a high degree of attention by ICL Pathway.


         17.1.3    The Monthly Reports describe existing AIs, and ICL Pathway's efforts resolve them. Al 376
                   (Accounting Integrity) caught my attention.         Accounting integrity is a fundamental
                   requirement of the LHITS. Al 376 was one of the final AIs to be closed.


         17.1.4    24 September 1999 marked the day Acceptance was granted, triggering a £68m invoice
                    delivered to POCL on 27 September 1999 to be paid in 30 days.


         17.1.5    In November 1999, at least one full month and possibly two full months after acceptance
                   was granted, ICL Pathway reported that "POCL have come round to the understanding that
                    dealing with residual Al 376 concerns in the short to medium term will rely on processes
                   and tools but no new software features as such."


         17.1.6    In January 2000, ICL Pathway states "If pressed POCL would agree that AIs 342, 372, 376,
                    378, 218, 391 are Closed / incapable of further update. Their Acceptance Manager is leaving
                   the project at the end of February." Further in the same report it states "The outturn on
                   AI376 was 0.06% Cash Account Discrepancies, exactly an order of magnitude better than
                   the target. Under this activity John P made significant contributions to the Third
                   Supplemental agreement, specified the committed CS Repair Facility, aligned the operating
                   agreement on Reconciliation to support the contract, and sorted out the necessary PinICLs
                   to clear."


         17.1.7    In February 2000, ICL Pathway declared that the POCL Acceptance Manager has left the
                    project and transferred the residual actions to "business-as-usual".


         17.1.8    It is unclear to me what exactly took place to close Al 376. The reading of these entries
                   leaves much room for interpretation.


         17.1.9    Regardless, the fact that accounting integrity was a persistent issue in the national rollout
                   of the LHITS cannot have been the intention of the sponsors nor the goal of ICL Pathway.


         17.1.10   The following tables contain verbatim extracts from the monthly reports (MRs) and PinICLs
                   and PEAKs (PPs) which I relied on in identifying this theme. I have intentionally not made
                   any corrections to grammar or spelling. Where I deemed it helpful, I have highlighted certain
                   sections in bold. The views expressed in these extracts are that of the authors, being
                    principally ICL Pathway, but in some cases ICL Pathway and POCL.

 FUJ00058187    ICL Pathway Monthly       October-99       376: (John P) This area is of particular concern. The
                Report - October 1999                      six-week observation period has started. The work is
                                                           in three parts: fixes yielding a target stability figure

                                                           facilities; and new Operational Business Change
                                                           (OBC) procedures. Although all fixes are
                                                           implemented, problems arising from Pathway

                                                           several new people are now involved and are not yet

 FUJ00058187    ICL Pathway Monthly       October-99       Too many reference data errors are being distributed
                Report - October 1999                      to the counter. End to end design reviews are being

                                                           having a major impact on Acceptance Incident 376.

                                                           process is inadequate and must be improved before

 FUJ00058187    ICL Pathway Monthly       October-99       Managing the Acceptance Resolution Plan during the
                Report - October 1999                      balance of 1999 will be critical to our clean start in

                                                           end concerns are the most important and do require
                                                           a positive joint attitude from POCL as well as careful

 FUJ00058188    ICL Pathway Monthly       November-99      The focus of work has remained the resolution of
                Report - November                          residual Acceptance incident hurdles such that both
                1999                                       POCL and Pathway are happy for roll out to re-
                                                           commence on 24th January. POCL have confirmed
                                                           that that is still their intention subject to being
                                                           satisfied as to progress on Al 376 in particular.
 FUJ00058188    ICL Pathway Monthly       November-99      The most serious issue on acceptance resolution
                Report - November                          concerns AI376 and the integrity of accounting data
                1999                                       being managed from the end to end basis with
                                                           Horizon. This in turn requires more disciplined and
                                                           strict accounting integrity controls, some of which
                                                           can be achieved through the EPOSS reconciliation
                                                           software and others through process and
                                                           independent tools and the balance through stronger
                                                           end to end control of the reference data processes.
                                                           The plan to handle the main problem area and indeed
                                                           the lower level actions across a range of Al issues is
                                                           well constructed, being followed and is capable of
                                                           achievement. However, there is little contingency in
                                                           the plan with respect to timescale and we do need a
                                                           formal agreement with POCL, particularly in the case
                                                           of reference data procedures which have been
                                                           defined during workshops. These need to be drawn

                                                           Red Flag issue is that TIP has apparently not

                                                           There is a short list of PinICLs that we must deal with
                                                           to clear up the Acceptance Resolution Timetable and

                                                           individual elements. This will be circulated

                                                           ready for closure. A more detailed description of
                                                           POCL's intent was provided on 30/11, in effect asking
                                                           for Payments and Receipts to be forced equal
                                                           through some form of automated suspense account
                                                           entry.
                                                           The only current instances of Payments and Receipts
                                                           being unequal are where the Horizon system has to
                                                           inherit a manual or ECCO system that was
                                                           unbalanced before migration.
                                                           The issue was discussed on 2/12 in a full forum and
                                                           POCL reconfirmed its position that such unbalanced
                                                           migrations were preferable to making an automated
                                                           suspense account transfer.
                                                           Closure continues to be sought.
                                                           342: POCL commented to ICL Pathway on 1/12 that
                                                           TIP references 986 and 995 had occurred and were
                                                           awaiting analysis and rectification plans.
                                                           In the case of reference 986 the office was on an
                                                           extended CAP, which should have been known to
                                                           POCL. Reference 995 was caused by the outlet
                                                           having fewer counters installed than were previously
                                                           scheduled and the system controls will not initiate
                                                           polling until all counters have participated in a first
                                                           end of day. In summary, there is no problem with
                                                           ICL Pathway software.
                                                           Closure continues to be sought.

                                                           as scheduled.
                                                           376: The POCL action to approve clearance of all
                                                           incremental fixes installed by 14/9 from field
                                                           evidence remains open.
                                                           The Pathway procedures for manual input were
                                                           presented to TIP/TP on 1/12 and material for the test
                                                           of manual input has been prepared. However, POCL

                                                           POCL will request DSS to close this incident.
                                                           There were 119 impounds in the first three weeks.
                                                           ICL Pathway understands this is a slightly lower rate

                                                           POCL commented to ICL Pathway on 1/12 that it
                                                           required an update on Pathway's investigations into
                                                           the problem of bar-code reading after a manual
                                                           scales transaction. An update was provided at the
                                                           Delivery Meeting of 24/11. A PinICL to resolve the
                                                           issue of scanning after manual scales is in progress.
                                                           A simple workaround is available. POCL also stated
                                                           on 1/12 that Pathway had failed to produce statistics
                                                           for the first two weeks of the four-week trial as
                                                           agreed. In fact ICL Pathway had delivered the
                                                           statistics POCL had asked for covering the first two
                                                           weeks on 30/11. POCL has since asked for a daily
                                                           level of analysis. The final two weeks totals will be
                                                           available in a few days time - the daily OBCS
                                                           transaction counts will also be provided.

 FUJ00058188    ICL Pathway Monthly       November-99      POCL decided not to stop roll out on 24th November

                                          two stock units for a total value Of £428.10. The transfer appears to
                                          have caused an imbalance in the office during CAP 35 with the total
                                          Payments being greater than total Receipts by £528.20 (twice the

18.       Payment and receipt imbalances were common symptoms
          with varied causes

18.1      Background


          18.1.1     The accounting integrity issue highlighted in the previous section directed me to identify
                     examples of accounting issues within the PPs. This section of the Report explores the
                     selected examples of accounting issues as represented by payment and receipt imbalance
                     issues.


          18.1.2     Section 4.7 of this Report provided an overview of the balancing and roll-over process that
                     was used in LHITS. I have reproduced the example from that section for ease of reference,
                     but I have updated it to show how a payment and receipt imbalance could occur.


          18.1.3     In this example a bug in the system causes the brought forward balance to be incorrectly
                     calculated as three times the correct value (later in this section are details of a PP
                     (PC0027139) where it is documented that a scenario akin to this occurred in LHITS). The
                     brought forward balance was calculated as £16,500, rather than the correct value of £5,500
                     (the red text shows where the error occurs).

          18.1.4   This shows an imbalance of £11,000 (payments greater than receipts). If the LHITS error
                   was not known, this would appear as a shortfall of £11,000.


          18.1.5    What is also apparent from this example is that there are various other issues that could
                   result in an imbalance, for example:


                   (a)    There are payments that were not recorded in the LHITS, or payments that were
                          erroneously recorded in the LHITS;


                   (b)    There are receipts that were not recorded in the LHITS, or receipts that were
                          erroneously recorded in LHITS;


                   (c)    The carried forward balance was incorrect because the cash and/ or stock were not
                          correctly declared by the SPM, or there have been cash and stock changes that cannot
                          be accounted for.


         Methodology

          18.1.6    Working with the PPs loaded into Brainspace, an initial search was run over the PPs to
                   identify those which contained the Concepts of: error, cash, issue, fail, and others as shown
                   in the figure below:


         Figure 18.1 Brainspace concept search results




          18.1.7   This search returned 38,803 PPs, however only a small number of these were weighted
                   highly relevant to each of the displayed concepts.


          18.1.8   Reviewing those at the top of the distribution revealed an issue mentioned in several PPs,
                   namely cash or stock not balancing, with a common phrase used being "receipts vs
                    payments". This was input into a new, more focused search, which included the following
                   additional concepts as being closely linked:




                                                                                                            132

          18.1.9    It is worth noting that "EnteredBBF" is commonly found in the PPs when pasting in error
                    messages from a manual migration ("MiMan") message store.


          18.1.10   This search returned 67 documents, which were manually reviewed in order of descending
                    likely relevance. Once 11 documents were identified as relevant, a CMML model was created,
                    which identified a set of documents likely to also be relevant to the same concept.


          18.1.11   Three additional rounds of training were undertaken, as set out in the table below:


         Table 18.2 Verbatim extracts from Monthly Reports

 1        Manual    22:           1,334         Example documents were provided to the model for the first round,
                    11 / 11                     resulting in a high number of likely relevant documents and
                                                additional refinements required.


 2        Top       32:           576           The ten documents with the highest scores were reviewed,
          Scores    16 / 16                     resulting in five documents being coded positive, and five
                                                documents coded negative.
 3        Top       42:           955           The ten documents with the highest scores were reviewed. This
          Scores    26 / 16                     time all 10 documents were coded positive.
 4        Diverse   51:           386           To further refine the model, we ran a "diverse active" round to
          Active    28 / 23                     sample a mixture of ranked documents. Two were coded positive,
                                                and seven coded negative. The model was refined and resulted in
                                                386 documents being ranked in the highest relevancy tier.


          18.1.12   Due to the differences in how each system stores the rank number (Brainspace assigns a
                    cut-off from 0.8000 whereas Relativity rounds up from 0.7950), there were 399 documents
                    ranked 0.8 or higher (highly relevant to this concept). This is not necessarily all "relevant"
                    documents however it is the set which are most likely to be relevant based on the seed
                    documents provided to Brainspace.


          18.1.13   Of the 399 PPs, 137 were selected for review by my team, which identified 127 PPs as
                    relevant to the concept of payment and receipt imbalance. The following section contains
                    an analysis of this population.

                    (b)     Defect cause (note this term is used interchangeably with 'root cause'o9):                 I
                            understand this was captured for the purpose of supporting root cause analysis so as
                            to "... ensure the same errors do not occur twice.". A defect cause value is mandatory
                            for all new calls and the defect cause may change during the life cycle of the call as
                            investigation matures and a better view of the problem is identified70.


          18.1.15   Since the 'Response Category' and 'Defect cause' are refined during the lifetime of a PP, I
                    selected the final chronological values for these analyses.

          18.1.17    Whilst I do not have formal definitions for the values shown in the figure above, I conclude
                     that 19% of the closure reasons (Administrative Response, Other) do not provide much
                     insight into the investigation process.

          18.1.19    Based on this data I make the following observation:


                     (a)     A significant proportion of these PPs had defect causes that were recognised as being
                             related to the design or development of LHITS (45%)71. This indicates to me that
                             there were acknowledged bugs, errors, or defects in LHITS that were capable of
                             giving rise to a payment and receipt imbalances.


         Days to resolve:

          18.1.20    The figure below shows how long the reviewed PPs remained open.




J1       Whilst formal definitions of these defect codes were not available to me, I have assumed, prima facie, that the defects
         of 'design - high level design', 'Development - code', 'Development - low level design', and 'Development - reference
         date' all relate to acknowledged bugs, errors, or defects in the LHITS.

18.2     Qualitative observations

         18.2.1    PPs are technical documents: their interpretation is sometimes difficult. I have provided an
                   example PinICL and PEAK in Appendix C in order to fully illustrate the challenges of
                   interpreting these.


          18.2.2   To illustrate the payment and receipt imbalances that occurred during the national rollout,
                   it is useful to examine individual PPs. Therefore, in this section I have selected seven PPs
                   that highlight the varied causes of the payment and receipt imbalances.


          18.2.3   For the benefit of the reader, I have structured my review of the seven PPs into the following
                   form:


                   (a)     Summary — High-level information relating to the PP


                   (b)     Chronology — Selected excerpts from the PP's comments


                   (c)     My observations


          18.2.4   Based on my review of these documents I make the following general observations:


                   (a)     Many of these PPs seem to have been raised as a result of internal reconciliations.


                   (b)     There does appear to be an earnest effort, on the part of the SSC, to investigate
                           these issues, identify a root cause, and mitigate future recurrences.


                   (c)     The tickets show that different teams were involved when investigating these issues.


                   (d)     In the majority of these PPs, it is not evident that the identified issue was resolved.


                   (e)     In a majority of these PPs, the root cause is related to LHITS.


          18.2.5   The following tables contain verbatim extracts from the PinICLs and PEAKs (PPs). I have
                   intentionally not made any corrections to grammar or spelling. The views expressed in these
                   extracts are that of the authors.

 (Garrett Simpson)           10:19:31    This is an illustration of the stupidities that ECCO software allows.
                                         A clerk can transfer cash and cheques between stock units without
                                         bothering to make sure they match up. The result shows up when
                                         the transaction data is migrated to Horizon which insists on clear
                                         demarcation between cash and cheques. In this case the critical

                                         exactly equals the discrepancy noted.

 (Steve Warwick)             18:01:56         It may be of interest that the value of the discrepancy
                                              between the TIP and Pathway figures appears to
                                              correspond to 2 x £230.63. During the balancing of
                                              stock unit AA on 18.8.99, a stock adjustment was made
                                              to reduce the value of Cheques (Product 2) by this
                                              amount, with a corresponding increase in Cash. These
                                              two stock adjustment records were later individually
                                              reversed, generating a further 4 transactions for
                                              £230.63, 3 against Cash (Product 1) and 1 against
                                              Cheques (Product 2). Therefore in total 4 Cash
                                              transactions (two positive, two negative) and two
                                              Cheques transactions (one positive and one negative)
                                              were written.

                                              Given that there have previously been issues with TIP's
                                              rejections of 'Existing Reversal' transactions where the
                                              reversal settlement contained no cross-reference details,
                                              is it possible that this has caused the reconciliation
                                              failure? According to the message store data, the Cash

 (Steve Warwick)             15:58:10         From further information received from TIP, the
                                              sequence of events seems to be as follows:
                                              1.   At 17:21:20 on 18.8.99 a stock adjustment was
                                                   carried out to reduce the value of cheques by
                                                   £230.63. This wrote two transactions - one to
                                                   reduce the value of cheques (17:21:20), one to
                                                   increase the value of cash (17:21:20) by the same
                                                   amount, both transactions carried the mode 'SAN'
                                                   (TIP - 18).
                                              2.   At 18:22:27 on 18.8.99 a reversal of THE CASH
                                                   SETTLEMENT transaction for the Cheque adjustment
                                                   took place resulting in two transactions being
                                                   written against Cash, one to reduce the value of
                                                   cash (18:22:27) and one to increase the value of
                                                   cash to settle the reversal (18:22:49), both

                                                   transactions carried the mode 'ER' (TIP - 1 with
                                                   reversal indicator).

                                              3.   At 18:24:32 on 18.8.99 a reversal of the CHEQUE
                                                   ADJUSTMENT transaction (see 1 above) was carried
                                                   out, generating two transactions - one to increase
                                                   the value of cheques (18:24:32) and one to reduce
                                                   the value of cash by the same amount (18:24:37).

                                              These transactions are recorded in the message store
                                              with the correct signs. From the information supplied by
                                              TIP it seems as though they have received/treated the
                                              transaction at 18:24:32 (a reversal of a previous
                                              reduction in the value of cheques) as though it was a
                                              reduction in value rather than an increase in value,
                                              therby calculating a discrepancy of twice the amount.

                                              Either the sign on the transaction value sent to TIP was
                                              incorrect, or TIP have misinterpreted the data sent.

 (Jim Anscomb)               13:48:14         Looking at the tip file there were 2 reversals for 230.63
                                              in quick succession, the first is translated for tip as
                                              balancing + and - entries, the second however is
                                              translated into two + entries, which would account for
                                              the error. See extract of tip file and message store

 (John Moran)                                           This difference in the receipt and Payment totals was
                                                        caused by the fact that non-core reference data was
                                                        not delivered to this office in time. The reference data
                                                        was for OBCS products 177 to 185. As this reference
                                                        data included primary mappings for these products
                                                        these products could not be mapped to the cash
                                                        account at stock unit rollover. This is what caused the
                                                        difference in the receipt and payment totals.

 My observations
 Was the immediate issue    Whilst the text states that a BIM was raised and the impacted transactions were
 fixed?                     identified and included with the BIM, it is not possible to determine, from the PP,
                            whether the transactions were updated to map them correctly. If I assume that
                            the BIM process would rectify this issue, then it appears that the appropriate
                            steps were taken to rectify the issue.
 Was a defect/ root cause   The text indicates that this was a known issue and a clear root cause is provided
 identified?                (i.e., the product reference data required to correctly map the transactions to
                            the cash account had not been delivered to the branches, so the transactions
                            were not mapped).
 Was this defect/ root      The root cause recorded in the PP is "General - Unknown". The root cause is
 cause correctly recorded   clearly defined in the PP and therefore a root cause more akin to 'Product
 in the PP?                 reference data not delivered in time' would seem like a more accurate and useful
                            root cause.
 Is there evidence that     The text references the fact the branches had now received the required

                                                      is almost certainly related to an MVL transaction

                                                      transactions took place in the week and there was
                                                      also a Loss declared the previous week for this value
                                                      against Cash. The value of £155 was also

                                                      and a gain of £155 was recorded when balancing at

                                                      written. This meant that transactions carried out on
                                                      the stock unit totalling £155.00 (Declaration

 EDSC                      1999-09-16 10:51:32        I have told the originator that the cause of this
 (Garrett Simpson)                                    problem was the deletion of the relevant stock unit
                                                      and asked him to agree closure. He wanted to know
                                                      if there is going to be a change in the software to
                                                      prevent such deletion and when it is going to arrive.
                                                      It sounded as though he would agree closure once
                                                      he has a date.

                                                      This is not relevant to this call: we have explained
                                                      the discrepancy in the figures which is what, strictly,

 (Garrett Simpson)                                    David Salt rang back. I had spoken to Steve Warwick
                                                      in the meantime and found that the fix to prevent
                                                      such stock unit deletion went out to the live estate
                                                      on 15-Aug - so it has been in place now for a month.

 (Steve Warwick)                                      The original response given to TIP was based on the
                                                      fact that the symptom of the call appeared to be
                                                      similar to other calls which had been identified as
                                                      being signing problems. This initial view was
                                                      provided along with the statement that the incident
                                                      was still under investigation and that once the
                                                      evidence had been examined the root cause would
                                                      be setermined. The root cause has now been
                                                      determined and John Pope has updated the
                                                      spreadsheet shared with POCL re. AI376. Closure
                                                      will be agreed between John Pope and Calum Craig

 My observations
 Was the immediate issue   FADs 230511, 13523 and 101114:
 fixed?                    If I assume that the issuing of the RED 515 notice to the customer resolved the
                           PP, then yes.

                           FAD 278523:
                           From my reading of the text, I do not see clear evidence that the deleted Stock
                           Unit ZZ issue being fixed for this FAD. However, David Salt agreed to close the

 Was a defect/ root cause   FADs 230511, 13523 and 101114:
 identified?                The root cause was identified as mode attributes on the transactions had 'null'
                            values, which resulted in the transactions not being sent to TIP.

                            FAD 278523:
                            The root cause was identified as a stock unit ZZ deletion before the EOD marker
                            had been written, which resulted in transactions not being sent to TIP.
 Was this defect/ root      The defect cause recorded was "14: Development — Code". I assume that this
 cause correctly recorded   applied solely to FAD 278523. If this assumption is correct, this seems like an
 in the PP?                 appropriate defect code for FAD 278523. It is unclear whether this also applied
                            to FADs 230511, 13523 and 101114 which were a different issue.
 Is there evidence that     FADs 230511, 13523 and 101114:
 this defect/ root cause    There is no discussion in the PP related to any action being taken to investigate
 was addressed?             why the mode attribute values were "null."

                            FAD 278523:
                            The root cause for FAD 278523 was addressed through the fix rolled out on 15
                            August.
 Observations on the        The PP is somewhat difficult for me to follow as two distinct problems are being
 management and closure     discussed on a single PP. Regardless, it does appear that the SSC properly
 of the issue.              closed the two problems discussed.


 Observations on defect /   FADs 230511, 13523 and 101114:
 root cause                 This PP contains no information regarding "null" values present in the mode
                            data.

                            FAD 278523:
                            The root cause is clearly identified and based on the text of the PP, would be
                            prevented in the future via an update to LHITS.

Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




                                                      Initial investigations have shown that the problem
                                                      arose at the time that the Office Trial Balance report
                                                      was produced. On the Office Trial Balance report
                                                      the brought forward value was £71k instead of £14k.
                                                      This appears to have been caused by the creation of
                                                      a correctional stock unit (Stock Unit 22) which was
                                                      additional to the normal stock unit (AA). Due to an
                                                      error in the code, when the stock unit balance
                                                      records are read the first stock unit (22 - first in
                                                      alphabetical sequence) is correctly identified as
                                                      having no 'Brought Forward' value from the previous
                                                      week, the system then incorrectly assumes that this
                                                      must be the migration week and generates a
                                                      brought forward value for the stock unit which is
                                                      incorrect. This error is being investigated for urgent
                                                      correction.

                                                      Further investigation of the discrepancy on the Cash

                                                      only issue at the root of the problem.

                                                      and a mis-match of £5709.01 (Payments lower than
                                                      Receipts). This appears to be an error in the CA
                                                      preparation process since the same set of records

                                                      Re-running the message store data on our
                                                      development system did not replicate the problem
                                                      and the Cash Account was correctly produced in a
                                                      balanced state.

                                                      Investigation of how this occured will continue,
                                                      however in the meantime if the office has not yet
                                                      rolled into CAP 14 then I suggest that they re-run

                                                      On the evidence we have seen, I would expect this
                                                      to produce a correctly balanced Cash Account.

 (Steve Warwick)                 10:32:04       "The cause of the problems in all three CAPS at this outlet was the
                                                fact that Stock Unit DD's rollover records from CAP 5 to CAP 6
                                                represented a 'nil' balance (the total stock holding was nil, no
                                                receipts or payment transactions were recorded) despite the fact
                                                that the stock unit had been trading normally during the period.
                                                This issue was raised in PinICL 43811 and is still under
                                                investigation within the EPOSS Development team.

                                                The fact that Stock Unit DDs transactions and stock holdings were
                                                omitted from the CAP 5 Cash Account meant that the Brought
                                                Forward value for the Office in CAP 6 was incorrect. This caused
                                                the CAP 6 Cash Account to misbalance. I am still investigating why
                                                the CAP 7 Cash Account misbalanced, but I note that the office
                                                returned to a balanced position in CAP 8.

                                            equivalent to these amounts. This failure will have compounded

                                            theis incident happened in mid may. What was the point of the

 (Diane Rowe)               09:12:03        Development have given you an answer, but I'm not sure that it
                                            helps.

                                            What do you think?
 MSU                       2000-07-12       F} Response :
 (John Moran)               09:47:52        1. I need to know what the correct Cash Account figures should
                                            have been were it not for the Dataserver failure. Can these be
                                            derived from the transactios in the message store, or the trial cash
                                            account.

                                            2. The diagnostic code which was delivered before this incident
                                            happened was promised to aid in investigating the cause of this
                                            problem. Has this code helped? How?

                                            3. At some point a WP was delivered that would alert the user that
                                            there was a problem with the SU roll over and the user woulf be
                                            promted with a message to re do the roll over. Has this been
                                            delivered? If so why did the roll over process not cease and promt
                                            the user to try again?
 EDSC                      2000-07-12       I have been asked by Walter Wright to submit more detail and I
 (Martin McConnell)         12:29:00        also note John's queries; in response to these first:
                                            1. We can reconstruct the Cashaccount at some point but I do
                                                 not believe this to be an 'L1HOT' issue, I think this will have to
                                                 queued up and reprioritised (or cloned specifcally for this

Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione, dated 14 September 2022




                                            3.   Code has been issued at CI4 which will back the user out from
                                                 key phases of rolover should the system detect that rposte
                                                 readied retrievals have failed to yield data.

                                            I don't think I'm being premature in revealing that we think we
                                            know know why these failures with Dataserver are occrring. Steve
                                            Warwick experienced such a failure on a rig he was testing against
                                            and found the root cause was that Archiving was active during a
                                            riposte query; this only occurs 'out-of-hours' at the end of each
                                            working day. Archiving will occur 'in-hours' should the counter
                                            have been switch off over night for 7 condecutive days and hence
                                            the sprordic nature of these incidents (or where PM's do their
                                            balancing near the archiving time at 10pm.)

 (John Ballantyne)          14:35:34        I have spoken to Martin McConnell who advised call to be routed
                                            to EPOSS-FP for assistance to re-produce the Cash account as per
                                            John Moran's requirements.

 (Gerald Barnes)            14:18:44        It proved to be very difficult to resurrect the cash account data for
                                            week 5. Steve Warwick's analysis tool showed that not only was
                                            stock unit DD corrupt but also stock unit XXX. EPOSS nodes
                                            91579999 and 90029999 were missing and had to be resurrected.
                                            In the end the reconciliation code was adapted to give data for
                                            every CashAccLine with the exception of 99990001 which is the
                                            receipts balance bought forward; but that can be calculated by
                                            looking at the receipts total from the previous CAP CashAccLine
                                            99990700. The resurrected figures are given in the attached file
                                            CAPS. The lines containing

                                            <Application: EPOSSWeeklyDump>
                                            <DumpOf:AccumulatedFigures>


                                            give the recalculated values for each CashAccLine. They contain
                                            the CashAccLine number with a prefix giving the table number.
                                            Note that lines 99990701 and 99990702 can not be trusted
                                            absolutely but their sum will be correct for the overall discrepancy
                                            table value. An alternative way of looking at the results is to look
                                            at the lines
                                            Containing

                                            <Application: EPOSSWeeklyRecon>
                                            <EPOSSTransaction: <TranType: WeeklyCAErr>.

                                            They give the original and recalculated CashAccLine data for each
                                            line that was wrong - all other lines in the cash account would
                                            have been correct. Note that lines 99990701 and 99990702 are
                                            not included in this set.

 (Gerald Barnes)            14:43:18        I am not sure it is worth spending time trying to resurect the other
                                            CAPs. The method I have derived assumes that the CashAccLines
                                            for the previous CAP. I see from Steve Warwicks's analysis that
                                            CAP 6 was not correct as well. Now if I rerun the tool I have
                                            developed on CAP 6 it will use as its base line the CashAccLine
                                            figures in CAP 5 which we know are wrong and I have just
                                            recalculated. I think therefore that enough time has been spent on

Appendix Cl - Example PinICL

Shown below is an example of a PinICL with some of the challenges of interpreting this highlighted as call-outs.
We have deliberately selected an example PinICL which contains more fulsome descriptions (some PinICLs are a
lot more challenging to interpret). It is important to note that a PinICL was written for internal tracking purposes
by the team trying to investigate and resolve the identified issues. They were, presumably, not written is such a
way as to provide a complete and accurate explanation of all investigatory steps such that someone reviewing
these some 20+ years later could fully understand what had occurred. The PinICL should be viewed with this
context in mind, but nonetheless the challenge of interpreting these documents remains relevant to my review
and therefore the approach adopted.
