1am employed by Post Office Ltd. a part of the Royal Mail Group as an Auditor
working within the Security & Audit section and have been so employed for

approximately 4 years though have been employed by the Post Office for about 8 years.

The role of the audit team is to carry out routine audits of Post Office Branches in order
to carry out verification of cash and stock as well as conduct certain compliance checks.
At times audits are specifically requested by the Retail Line Manager or by members of

the Investigation section.

On Tuesday 14'* January 2003, I was part of a team of four auditors who attended
Rugeley MSPO, 18 Anson Street, Rugeley WS15 2BF on the request of the Investigation

section, this team was lead by Mr Glyn Burrows the Audit Manager.

Part of my role was to carry out the verification of the ‘AM’ stock unit which I was
aware was the Manager's stock and I also verified the ‘PH’ stock unit (philatelic stock).
The AM stock unit was the cash and stock held in the two safes in the back office, one of

these safes held mainly the bulk coin whilst the other safe held the banknotes.

Continyation of statement of Kevin ORGILL

In order to carry out this verification I would interrogate the Horizon computer system
and print off a Balance Snapshot for AM stock unit. This I did at 0819 hours and I
produce this printout as item number KO/01. This printout illustrates the amount of
cash and stock which should be held by this stock unit and it can be seen that this
printout indicates that there was £ 72,159.03 in cash, £ 282,000.00 in Foreign Currency
and £ 1,449.00 in National Lottery instant game cards, giving a total of cash and stock
within AM stock unit of £ 355,608.03.

I would initially start with counting the cash on hand and as I count each denomination
I note it down on a form called the Security & Audit - Cash Summary, I now produce
the form I used for the cash verification as item number KO/02. I initially reached a
total figure of £ 68,916.98 as shown in the 1st column, however, some further
amendments were required which lead to the figures shown in the 2"4 column equating
to £ 69,191.98. Subsequently this figure was further changed when a further £70.96 was
located bringing the final figure up to £ 69,262.94.

At the time, I wrote on the Balance snapshot (item KO/01) -2967.05 next to the cash
declared figure of £ 72,159.03, however, the final cash difference to what was indicated
on the snap shot was £ 2,896.09.

I then looked for the £ 282,000.00 worth of foreign currency, however I could not locate
it within either of the two safes and the staff who were present at the office were asked
if there was anywhere else that stock or cash for the AM stock unit was stored, they
were not aware of any other stock or cash in relation to the AM stock unit and therefore

I puta cross sign next to the figure of £ 282,000.00.

Continuation of statement of Kevin ORGILL

The figure for the National Lottery instants changed by £10 making a total of £ 1,459.00
which meant that the physical amount of cash and stock held by the AM stock unit as of
14% January 2003 was £ 70,721.94 as opposed to what the snap shot declared of

£ 355,608.03, giving a difference of £ 284,886.09 of which £ 282,000.00 was as a result of

no foreign currency being on hand within this stock unit.

I then passed these figures and paperwork to Mr Burrows and then proceeded to verify
the PH stock unit which again was slightly different to what was declared on the

snapshot but not to any great extent, the figures were within £ 50 of each other.

Continuation of statement of Deborah Alison EDWARDS

In order to carry out this verification I would print off a command 2 and a command 3
printout from the Forde Moneychanger equipment. I did this at 0811 hours and
produce the printout as item number DAE/01. I should point out that the printout
indicates 0911 hours, however, the clock on the machine had not been adjusted and

therefore was one hour ahead.

The command 2 printout indicates all of the Foreign currency on hand together with the
travellers cheques, it lists each foreign currency type, the number of notes and travellers
cheques and the sterling value of the notes for that currency. At the bottom of this
printout it gives a total sterling value of all of the various currencies held and in this

case that figure was £ 21,263.79.

The command 3 printout provides a summary of the transactions which have taken
place that week such as a total sterling value of Buy Notes (BN), Sell Notes (SN) and
Balance. The printout then also lists each of the currencies and shows how much was

bought and sold.

It can be seen that at the time of this printout the Forde Moneychanger was indicating
that there had been 21 transactions where notes had been bought (BN) to a sterling
value of £ 5,594.24 and that there had been 44 transactions where notes had been sold to
the sterling value of £ 371,082.58. The Balance is shown as a sterling value of

£ 21,263.79 which matches the total on the command 2 summary and should be the

sterling value of foreign currency held in the Bureau till.

I then commenced physically counting each of the currencies within the Bureau till and

wrote down the figures I found on a piece of paper which I now produce as item
number DAE/02. It can be seen that some of the figures agreed with the command 2
printout and others did not and I have indicated on DAE/02 the differences. There

wasn’t any huge discrepancies, just the odd amount here or there.

There were some other foreign currency amounts which I needed to transfer into the
Forde Moneychanger in order to obtain a final balance which I did at 11:51 hours (12:51
as indicated on the printout), I produce this printout as item number DAE/03. I then
printed off a new command 2 and command 3 printout, which I now produce as item
number DAEF/04 which indicates the amendments made and shows a total sterling
value of £ 21,642.20 which is the sterling value of the foreign currency held in the
Bureau till at that time. The command 3 printout shows the balance in sterling of

£ 21,642.20

During the course of the audit, I was made aware of the fact that the ‘AM’ stock unit
had indicated that it held £ 282,000.00 worth of Foreign currency which could not be
located and therefore to keeps things tidy as it was indicated as foreign currency it was
decided that it should be transferred from the ‘AM’ stock unit to the Bureau (BU) stock
unit which I did at 12:21 hours as indicated by the printout produced by the Horizon
computer system which I now produce as item number DAF/05. I also noted the
transfer of this amount on the ‘AM’ stock unit balance snapshot (item KO/01) and it is
my handwriting which appears on this printout indicating Foreign currency

“Transferred to BU”.

I then produced a command 10 (weekly summary) printout from the Forde

Moneychanger, I now produce this printout as item number DAE/06. This printout

shows the total cash held value of £ 22,938.72 and it is this figure which is input into the
Horizon system, the figure is made up of the figure of £ 21,642.20 which is the foreign
currency sterling value held and a revalue figure of £ 1,296.52. The revaluation figure is

as a result of the fluctuating exchange rates over the course of the week.

I then verified the cash (sterling) held within the bureau till by counting what was
physically held in the till and noting down the different denominations on a form called
a Network Audit - Cash Summary and then entering these amounts into the Horizon
system to produce a ‘Declared Cash’ Horizon printout, I now produce both as item
number DAE/07. It can be seen that the amount of sterling on hand in the Bureau till
that morning was £ 11,373.01.

With the above two figures of Foreign currency held £ 22,938.72 and the cash sterling
held £ 11,373.01 together with any further stock items, you get the ‘TOTAL STOCK &
MOP’ figure which in this case was £ 34,491.73.

In order to then obtain a final balance for the Bureau stock unit, you are required to
feed into the horizon system all of the figures relating to ‘RECEIPTS’ which is anything
which has been paid into that till, for instance Remittance items (REM) received from
Hemel Hempstead, etc including in this instance the figure of £ 287,000.00 as a transfer
in, £ 282,000.00 of that having been transferred in from ‘AM’ stock unit. Also all of the
figures in relation to ‘PAYMENTS’ must also be input into the Horizon system and this
would include any amounts such as Remittances out ete. In this particular instance I
was given a figure by Mr Burrows of £ 642,258.79 to input into the payments sections
and I believe this figure related to the value of several cheques which had been

removed from the Bureau till by the Police on the previous evening.

the input of data into the Horizon computer system in order to complete the office cash

account.

One of the initial actions I would perform at such an audit is to log onto the Horizon
computer system and request an ‘office snapshot’ printout. I can confirm that I
requested such a printout at 0831 hours on 14* January 2003, I produce this printout as
item number GB/01. The office snap shot printout provides a summary of all of the
cash and stock which should be held at the office at the time of the printout, it will also
provide a summary of all receipts and payments in relation to transactions conducted at
the Post Office since the beginning of business on Thursday 9 January 2003 up until

the time of the requested printout.

For instance the office snapshot, GB/01, states that the amount of cash that should be
present at the office at 0831 hours on 14th January 2003 is £125,458.72. It also provides
the sterling value of the amount of Foreign currency that should be on hand at the office

at that time of £389,005.30.

It is then a process of verify the cash and stock which is actually on hand at the Post

office and seeing if it agrees with the office snapshot.

I was made aware early on during the audit of the office by Mr Manish Patel, of the
Investigation team, that several cheques to the value of £638,675.65 had been removed
from the Bureau Till by the Police, therefore this amount immediately became a known

office shortage as the cheques were physically not on hand at the office.

Continuation of statement of Glyn Burrows

As each team member verified particular stock units, the results were provided to me
and I collated our findings via the P32 accounting sheet on my laptop. In particular, Mr
Kevin Orgill carried out a verification of the ‘AM’ stock unit and Ms Alison Edwards

carried out the verification of the Bureau Stock unit (BU).

In relation to the ‘AM’ stock unit, ! was made aware by Mr Orgill that the Horizon
snapshot (K0/01) in relation to this stock unit indicated that there should be £282,000
worth of foreign currency, however, this amount was not on hand, there were also

some other discrepancies found in this stock unit by Mr Orgill.

As the declared figure £282,000 related to an entry against Foreign currency, it was
decided that this amount should be transferred to the Bureau (BU) stock unit as J was
already aware that there would be a shortage in this stock due to the removal of the
above mentioned cheques. I also provided Alison with a figure in relation to the
missing cheques. Alison required this information in order to balance the Bureau stock,
the reason for Alison needing this information was that the overall discrepancy would
be transferred to our accounting team in Chesterfield known as Late Accounts, who

deal with the recovery of assets.

The reason for transferring the amount to late account was that we were not in
possession of the cheques and we did not know at the time if when presented the
cheques would be honoured. If the cheques were honoured then the amount would be
credited to the same late account to be offset against the discrepancy declared during

our Audit of accounts.

As each stock unit was verified it would then be ‘balanced’ and any shortages or

surplus found were adjusted with the main ‘AM’ stock unit, which as a result

ultimately balanced showing a shortage of £ 3086.39.

The Bureau stock unit was finalised and showed a shortage of £642,258.79 which was
made up of the value of the missing cheques (£638,675.65) plus an additional £3,583.14
which was differences in sterling and currency on hand compared with the Horizon

snapshot for that stock unit.

Therefore the audit declared a total shortage for the office of £645,345.18, which was the

amount, transferred to Late account.

At 1406 hours I produced another Horizon office snapshot which now showed the new
figures following the verification carried out by my team, as a result it can be seen that
the amount of cash on hand was now £123,649.03 as opposed to £125,458.72 as indicated
on the earlier printout GB/01, a difference of £1,809.69 and the foreign currency on
hand as verified by my team was now £22,938.72 as opposed to £389,005.30 as indicated
on the earlier printout GB/01, a difference of £366,066.58. I now produce this Horizon
snapshot printout as item number GB/02. I can also confirm that the writing that
appears at the top of this printout is that of my colleagues Mr Kevin Watkins, which
shows the office shortage figure of 645345,.18.

As mentioned previously I would also input the relevant data onto an electronic P32a
spreadsheet using my laptop computer, which indicates cash and stock figures as well
as figures in relation to transactions performed that week. It also shows the final audit
balance of the office, which in this case was a shortage of £645,345.18, I now produce a

printout of the electronic P32a form as item number GB/03.

Further to my statement of 14" January 2003, I wish to cover some of the aspects
regarding the office balance. Each clerk including myself would have a stock unit
which basically is the cash and working stock. There were 6 stocks at that time, mine
being stock unit 02. There were three other stocks, one the Bureau till, the second was
the philatelic stock and the third the ‘AM’ stock which was Carl Page’s stock which is
all the stuff in his safe and the back office.

On a Wednesday evening after the office had closed for business each clerk would
balance their own individual stock unit and verify their cash and stock to ascertain if
the stock balanced, or there was a shortage or surplus. I would on occasions balance the
philatelic stock though sometimes that would merely be rolled over into the following

week.

As Far as I know, Jayn would balance up the Bureau till as far as she could and Carl
would balance te ‘AM’ stock (Manager's stock) on the Thursday morning. On the
Wednesday evening when each of the counter stocks were balanced, if there was a

shortage or surplus, Carl had instructed me to transfer this to the ‘AM’ stock unit so

that at the end of the evening on the Wednesday, each of the counter stocks would
show a balance and could be ‘rolled’ over into the following week. This would mean
that all of the figures relating to the counter stocks would have been entered into
Horizon and would only require Carl to Balance the ‘AM’ stock on the Thursday

morning in order to balance the whole office.

The final office accounts were not always finalised on the Thursday and if Carl wasn’t
at the office the accounts had to wait until his return. There were times when the cash

account had not been finalised until Friday or even Saturday.

Once Carl had entered his figures onto Horizon, he would either print of the final cash
account or would ask me to do so. On the occasions I had been asked to print off the
final cash account, I would do so and then datestamp the form and sign it at the top
before one of the copies was sent away to Chesterfield. I would not check any of the
figures declared on the cash account as I did not have control of the ‘AM’ stock and I

assumed Carl had checked the figures and that they were correct.

T have been shown today, several cash accounts relating to week numbers 19, 20, 23, 25,
26, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, for the year 2002 which bear my signature. I have been
asked to comment on the figure which appears on the 2"4 page of the cash account, in
table 5, line 52 which is the foreign currency on hand figure. I took no part in obtaining

this figure and do not know where or how this figure is obtained

There would be times when Carl and I would go through the office ‘snapshot’

produced by Horizon and check off the correct entries.

Further to my statement of 26" March 2003, I have been asked by Mr Patel of the Post
Office Investigation section to clarify certain issues which he has raised with me if ] am

able to so.

I do know that there have been times when Rugeley Post Office has either been running
very low on a particular type of Foreign Currency or we have run out completely and
on those occasions Carl Page would ask Jayn normally to order the currency from the
local Co Op Travel outlet in Rugeley. Although I know that this has happened at times

I have only ever to been asked to do this myself on a couple of occasions.

On the occasions I have done this, I would take the cash from the Bureau till in sterling
for the amount, which we needed to purchase from the Co Op. I would then telephone
the Co Op travel and normally speak to a lady called Gwen who works there and place
an order with her. Shortly after placing the order I would go to the Co Op'travel and
purchase the currency, which had been requested. The rate.that this currency was sold
to me would be the Co Op’s normal selling rate, they would not provide us witha

better rate and I would not know the exchange rate prior to arriving at their outlet.

Having purchased the required currency from the Co Op, I would take the currency
and the Co Op till receipt back to the Rugeley Post Office. I used to place the receipt in
the Bureau till in case it was ever needed and I would then book the currency into the
Forde moneychanger. I would book the money in at the same exchange rate as it had
been purchased from the Co Op and I would book the whole amount in as one

transaction, I would not break them down into smaller transactions.

Tcannot now remember the amounts involved or the specific currency types I would
have purchased from the Co Op but it would have more than likely been euros and
probably for several hundred pounds worth and I would only perform these
transactions for customer who had already ordered currency and were noted in the

black diary which we kept by the Bureau till.

2002. There would appear to be 5 transactions one after the other amounting to 77,500
euros, I am fairly confident that I did not do that transaction as I would not have broken

the full amount down into several smaller amounts.

As previously stated in my first statement I did not have a great deal to do with the

Bureau till or the transactions but on the occasions when I take a cheque from

correctly, I would not take a post dated cheque fromt_

customer at the Post Office.

As far as I can recall any transactions which I have conducted wit! ifor

the purchase of Euros, he has always paid for by Cheque, I personally have never taken
a cash amount from him for such transactions nor part cheque and part cash, the full

amount has always been in the form of a cheque.

There is definitely one occasion when Jayn made me aware of some o:
cheques which had not been despatched at the end of the cash account week, however I

cannot now recall when that was, I believe it was towards the end of 2002.

In relation to the cheque taken for transactions other than for the Bureau, these cheques
would be despatched on a daily basis from this office for processing, there might be
some occasions when due to pressure of work they were not despatched that day but
would then go the following day, they certainly would not be held for a week like the

cheques for the Bureau were.

aware of how to perform a large part of the weekly office balance I do not know the full
procedures and there are certain areas, which J could not do such as balancing the
Bureau till and amalgamating the figures with the AM stock. Before Carl left to go on
holiday he told me to go as far as possible with the weekly balance and that he would
then finish it of on Sunday when he got back from leave, I believe he also told me to

give him a call should the auditors turn up whilst he was away.

On the morning of Thursday 27% June 2002, Jayn and myself arrived in the vicinity of
Rugeley Post Office and noticed a number of smartly dressed people waiting outside
the Post Office which I automatically assumed they were the auditors so both Jayn and I

sent Carl a text message using our mobiles phone.

We then opened up the office and allowed the auditors in and explained to them that
Carl was not here and that the office was not balanced as I did not know how to
complete it. Shortly afterwards Carl rang the office telephone number and I spoke to
him and he wanted me to do something with the Bureau till, I cannot specifically
remember whether it was to do with transferring an amount from the AM stock to the
Bureau, or Bureau to AM and it may have related to some cheques but I do not
remember now and at the time I did not understand what Carl wanted me to do nor did
I particularly want to do anything whilst the auditors were there. Within about 15 to 20
minutes of the 1s telephone call Carl had rung the office again twice to ask me if I had
done what he had asked and I explained that I had not been able to do it. I would say
that he sounded concerned when I had told him I had not been able to do it and
therefore he eventually asked to speaks to one of the auditors so I passed the telephone

over t0 the head auditor whose name I think was Glyn.

i should state that I did not feel it was my responsibility to do what Carl was asking me
to as if it was something he should have done then I did not see why I should have

become involved.

The auditors then continued to try and balance the office and eventually they left at the

end of the day, I cannot recall how the office balanced that week.

been so employed for approximately 4 years. During this time Mr Carl Page has been
the Subpostmaster and Margaret Pearce who is also employed at this post office
usually performs some of the roles of subpostmaster when Mr page is away from the
office. When I initially started employment at this office, I used to work on a part time
basis on given days of the week, which I cannot now recall. At that time, Mr Page's
wife used to also work at the office, a lady called Debbie and the majority of the time Mr
Page or his wife performed the day to day Bureau de Change transactions with the
customers. I at that time had not been trained to perform this task and therefore did not
perform bureau de change transactions. I! commenced performing Bureau de change
transactions about 3 years ago, though initially I did very little in the way of bureau
transactions as Mr Page and his wife normally dealt with them. At that time I was
shown the basics of how to perform these transactions by Mr Page and how to use the

Forde Moneychanger machine. At that time Mr Page played a full role at the office, he

believe that Mr Page performed the office accounts and Margaret assists him up to a
certain point and Mr Page finalises the accounts. I have not taken part in known how to
complete the weekly post office accounts. Around Christmas 2001, Mr Page's wife
Debbie left the post office and I then took on a greater role of performing bureau
transactions, though Mr Page still performed a number of these transactions although I
would say to a lesser extent as he started to remain at the office for shorter periods
spending sometime away from the office. When Mr Page or I was not available, then
Margaret would perform the bureau transactions. In order to perform bureau
transactions the office requires exchange rates for the selling and buying of different
types of currency that the post office deals with. I am aware that First Rate, the bureau
de change organisation that the post office uses, fax through on a daily basis the
exchange rates that the office should use for transactions that day. The fax either
comes through the evening before or on the morning of the day for which the rates
apply. There are exchange rates for a number of currencies for both selling and buying
currencies and for the sale and buy back of foreign currency travellers cheques which
are at a slightly different rate to cash transactions. I have also noted that the fax, which
is relevant to a Saturday, makes specific reference to a special exchange rate in
relation to US dollars and Euros for any transactions above £5000 sterling. Although I
am aware of this fax with the exchange rates, I have never been required to or asked to

enter the exchange rates into the Forde Moneychanger, which is used to perform the

bureau transactions. As the main transactions at this office involve US Dollars and
Euros, I am aware that these exchange rates for cash transactions are changed daily
on the Forde Moneychanger machine, however, the other currency is not changed daily
and is only update to the current value as and when a customer requests this type of
currency. The Post Office does not physically hold all types of currency at the office
and the vast majority of the “non popular” currency such as Hong Kong Dollars etc.
needs to be ordered specially from the post office cash centre in Hemel Hempstead.

Mr Page keeps a small AS size black diary specifically for bureau transactions and to
record when a customer who has previously ordered currency will be coming into collect
it. On these occasions when a customer comes into collect pre ordered foreign
currency, I will enter that days exchange rate into the Forde Moneychanger at the time
of the transaction. On most occasions Mr Page enters the new exchange rates into the
Forde Moneychanger himself, on the occasions where I have set the exchange rates
for US Dollars and Euros, the most popular currency types I have asked Mr Page what
rate I should enter into the machine for the selling only of these two types of currency.
The travellers cheques and the buying back of cash currency is set as per the daily fax.
I am aware that Mr Page sets the rates for both US Dollars and Euros to a slightly
higher rate than what the First Exchange fax stipulates and this has always been the
way Mr Page has operated the bureau since I have been here. I am aware that the
notes in relation to the two above currencies for selling is higher and therefore the

customer gets more foreign currency for each pound, however, I have not queried this

connected up to a display board which displays on the customers side the rate of
exchange for various types of currency, however the display board in this office has not
been working for several months. When I serve a customer, they enquire as to the
current exchange rate, which for Euros I would know that day as it is a popular
transaction or if I didn't know it the Forde Moneychanger when interrogated will print out
the exchange rate. If the customer wishes to proceed, I would then take the cash
sterling from them and enter the amount into the forde moneychanger once I had
entered which currency was required. I then press a button labelled reverse sell which
automatically works out the amount of the currency the customer should get which is
printed out on a till roll attached to the machine. This till roll is a duplicate roll and the
top part of it is torn off and given to the customer together with the foreign currency and
the undercopy remains attached to the original roll so that at the end of the week there
will be a whole roll or more for bureau transactions performed that week. These rolls
when complete for one cash account week ( Thursday to Wednesday) I store in the
bottom drawer by the bureau de change work station. During the time that I have been

The normal procedure for the acceptance of cheques for payment of foreign exchange

Further to my statement of 26 March 2003, I have been asked by Mr Patel of the Post

Ican confirm that there have been times when Rugeley Post Office has either been
running very low ona particular type of Foreign Currency or we have run out
completely, on some of those occasions Carl Page would ask me to contact via
telephone the Co Op Travel outlet in Rugeley and order a certain amount of the
currency that we required. I should state that the main currency which has been bought
form the Co Op Travel in Rugeley would be euros though other currency types have

case. I would then telephone the Co Op travel and normally speak to a lady called
Gwen who works there and place an order with her. Shortly after placing the order I
would go to the Co Op travel and purchase the currency, which had been requested.
The rate that this currency was sold to me would be the Co Op’s normal selling rate,
they would not provide us with a better rate and I would not know the exchange rate

prior to arriving at their outlet.

Having purchased the required currency from the Co Op, I would be given a till receipt
and I would take both back to the Rugeley Post Office. The receipt obtained from the
Co Op was not retained and normally just thrown away, the currency was then booked
into the Forde moneychanger. Carl had told me to book the currency into the Forde
moneychanger at the same rate as we had purchased it for from the Co Op so if they
had sold us euros at an exchange rate of 1.5, I would book the euros into the Post Office
Forde Moneychanger at 1.5. Carl had also told me to book in the currency in several
amounts for instance if I had just bought 5000 euros, I would book them in at 1000 euros
ata time. This would mean there were five (5) transactions, the reason Carl gave me for
doing this was because he would get paid by the Post Office for each transaction and so
rather than it being one transaction it would be five transactions for which he would get

paid more.

I cannot be certain of the amounts involved but Carl would generally give me between
£500 and £4000 to buy the currency from the Co Op but it was not always euros that

were purchased. I should also state that it is not always me who goes to the Co Op

Travel, Carl has been himself and I believe others at this office have also been.

cheques, however, the times I have served him I would always put in the transaction as

GRO requesting the amounts to be broken down into smaller

transactions nor has Car] asked me to enter them in as a number of transactions on the

Forde moneychanger.

Ihave been shown a schedule identified as item number MP/3 by Mr Patel who has
asked me to comment on five transactions for the purchase of euros on Friday 7* June
2002. There would appear to be 5 transactions one after the other amounting to 77,500

euros, I am fairly confident that I did not do that transaction as I would not have broken

the full amount down into several smaller amounts.

Office and then it was noticed that the office did not have many euros left and sol

of Foreign Currency from the Cash Centre in Hemel Hempstead and I would generally
also book the money in when it arrived at Rugeley Post Office. This would entail
collecting it from the Royal Mail building next door as the currency would arrive in
several Royal Mail Special Delivery pouches, opening each pouch and verifying the
amounts enclosed agreed with the enclosed advice note. I would then book this
amount in onto the Forde moneychanger by entering the amount and type of currency
into the machine together with the exchange rate supplied on the advice note from

Hemel Hempstead.

There was a period in September 2002, I cannot recall the exact dates but Carl was away

on Holiday for a weekI I and during this time I decided to despatch the Bureau
cheques away properly on a daily basis. When Carl returned from his holiday he told

me again not to send away any of the cheques taken for the Bureau transactions.

As mentioned in my previous statement, I perform some of the balancing for the
Bureau on a Wednesday and then leave the remainder for Carl to complete. There is
definitely one occasion which was during the latter part of last year (2002) when after a
cash account week upon my arrival at the office on the Thursday of the new cash

account week I had notice a number of! GRO } cheques were still in the

Bureau till and I made mention of this to Margaret.
