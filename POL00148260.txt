Subject: FW: Decision taker in POL prosecution

Chris
I refer to recent conference with Brian Altman QC. Where he was of the view that decision Maker in POL
prosecutions should be should be a qualified lawyer NOT as present head of security.
The background is that The Crown Prosecution Service is the principal prosecuting authority in England and
Wales. It is responsible for prosecuting criminal cases investigated by the police but is independent from the
police. By applying the Code for Crown Prosecutors which gives guidance on the general principals to apply
when making decisions about prosecutions, the CPS can be seen to prosecute cases independently without
bias, from the police or other agencies, whilst still being in a position to work closely with them.
Counsel Simon Clarke of Cartwright King on page 6 of the Draft Prosecution policy recommends the in POL
prosecutions decision-taker should be:

i. A qualified lawyer.
This practice mirrors the approach of the Crown Prosecution Service, and is designed to ensure that the
decision to prosecute is taken by someone who is independent of the victim/loser and of the investigation.
The decision maker would have overview of the whole business. He would be acting on the advice of
specialist qualified lawyers, in the circumstances the risk to individual or business is negligible.
a).POL seeks independent advice in respect of its prosecutions from specialist qualified criminal lawyers
Cartwright King.

b). They provide advice on charging decisions in respect of cases investigated by POL by reference to the
Code for Crown Prosecutors.

c). Any prosecution undertaken by POL will therefore have been independently reviewed by lawyers who
have considered that there is sufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and if so that it
is in the public interest to prosecute.

I“

d). CK act as a fire” wall “ this avoids criticism and risk to POL.

I agree with BAQC and recommend the decision-taker should be a qualified lawyer as discussed it likely
tobe me.
Can we discuss.
