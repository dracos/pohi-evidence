achievement.

2. ISSUES ARISING FROM SERVICE REPORT

Highlights of previous period’s service statistics, concentrating on failures to meet required service levels, including major incidents reported, service

trends and service achievements

e Helpdesk - Liz Tuddenham noted that call volumes are dropping at the Helpdesk and there is now a gap with the NBSC call volumes.
Paul Westfield confirmed that ICL Pathway are still increasing their staffing as planned and the Wakefield site is opening on 1/12/00.
He also confirmed that they have no plans to reduce staffing as they are trying to get to 2.2 calls per outlet per month. Current figures
are 2.6 calls from mature offices and 5.6 calls from new offices per month.

e Helpdesk Services/System Services - due to the Rectification actions which are starting to be implemented improvements should soon
be seen in these figures.

¢ 20 Minute On Site Repair - figure for the SRB is 84.9 against a target of 50. This is based on 1 months data and has been extrapolated to
give a 4 month figure. However Richard Brunskill would like to re-check the figures as he is not convinced that the calculation is
correct. Richard also agreed to calculate the figure based on the previous 4 months data. Liz Tuddenham stated that she would like to
look at a sample of the calculations and work through them with Richard and Peter to aid understanding of the way the SLA is being
measured. It was agreed to hold a sub meeting after the January SRB has been issued to do this. (see AP001102).

3, REVIEW EXISTING LIVE SERVICES
To review the on-going actions, such as fault corrections, agreed service changes and POCL related work.

System Running Slowly
Graham Shervington expressed concern about the number of slow running outlets (18 known). This is being managed as a Problem and

Paul Westfield confirmed that ICL Pathway are trying to identify what the issues are.

Ghost Transactions

Graham Shervington also expressed concern about the number of offices reporting ghost transactions on daily reports (15 known,
anecdotally hundreds) . This is a Known Error and Paul Westfield explained that ICL Pathway are proposing to rectify this in M1 (due
March/April time). Paul agreed to provide details in writing of why this is happening so PON can assess whether they require
rectification to take place before M1 due to the impact on PON. (see AP001103)

Complaints/Flag Cases

Liz Tuddenham explained that Flag Cases which are dealt with by PON are high level complaints which have been sent to Directors or
MP’s etc. PON have an agreed process to deal with these complaints and requested that a fast track route is built into ICL Pathway’s
complaints procedures. Liz agreed to send copies of the complaints to Paul Westfield so that he is aware of them and Dave Law agreed to
work with Mark Haynes on developing a process to include responsibilities etc to enable a quick turnaround. (see AP001104)

7. ANY OTHER BUSINESS

Continuity Test (switch to Wigan from Bootle)

Graham Shervington expressed concern as to why the continuity test failed and Paul Westfield replied that the root cause of the failure
was not yet understood by ICL Pathway. Paul also explained that a re-test would be carried out once the root cause had been identified.
Graham Shervington understood that agreement has already been made to carry out the re-test in early January, on a weekend to
minimise any impact. Liz asked for confirmation that there was no impact on OBCS data delivery and Richard Brunskill agreed to check.
(see AO001105) Forum to monitor progress.

Business Continuity
Graham Shervington asked if PON could have sight of ICL Pathway’s Business Continuity Plans as copies of these have been refused. Paul

Westfield replied that he did not understand why this had been refused but he will investigate with Martin Bennett and feed back to the
next meeting. Mike Balmer also agreed to check the contract to establish if anything was detailed about access to the Plans. (see AP001106)

Remedies

Liz Tuddenham explained that PON is now ina position to agree March Hardware and Netware figures of £51091.90 and confirmed that
the BIMS figure for the quarter ending August 2000 is agreed as £27900.00. Paul Westfield expressed concern about the time taken to clear
the backlog and Liz explained that an adjustment factor principle has now been agreed which should speed up the resolution of these
figures, Richard Brunskill and Liz Tuddenham agreed to work closely to get the remedies standardised and sorted out. After some
discussion it was agreed to issue a credit note for the quarter ending August 2000 subject to any adjustments, by either PON or ICL
Pathway, arising from the checking of remedies. (see AP001107)

Richard also produced a summary report of remedies which he will amend to detail the adjustments and continue to supply on a monthly
basis for each HSRF.

Feedback from Operational Review Forums

Liz Tuddenham explained that a brief report giving feedback from each of the Operational Review Forums had been developed. It was
agreed to send out an initial example copy with these notes and in future to send out each monthly report with the agenda. A standard
agenda item will be included each month to deal with any issues arising from the report on an exception only basis. (see AP001108)
