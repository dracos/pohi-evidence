All

I thought I would give you a quick overview of the work we are doing to look at how we validate the integrity of the
Horizon system. This work is needed by the PO lawyers who have to have confidence in the system for prosecution
cases, it will also provide a baseline which can be used when IT expert witness statements are required for criminal
cases. As wellas legal cases I believe it will provide greater confidence within the PO teams who support challenges
made by SPMR’s (via Mediation, Second Sight or in internal investigations).

We will work closely with our criminal layers at Cartwright King and also employ and independent expert (likely to be
from Imperial College) to work with Fujitsu to perform this review.

One of the challenges we have faced has been how we validate a system as large as Horizon with its many interfaces to
other systems. The attached document describes what I think will become the scope of the system under the review. If
you have any question about this work or its scope let me know but given the current ExCo focus on the prosecution
process and the Mediation scheme I thought you ought to have some sight of what I am doing.

Regards

Andy
