Winsford Relocation - Timescale of events

26/01 Due to later than planned install of power supply to unit (due to bad weather),
Grant puts back project by 1 week. We couldn’t move the project back any further as
the Horizon Online embargo window came into force the following week after (for 3
weeks). If project were put back 4 weeks or more, then Grant would have incurred
further rental charges on the existing unit.

28/01 BT Confirm line install of ADSL & ISDN for 09/02 & 22/02 (my original
request was for 03/02)

01/02 Romec F&S confirm they will start alarm works 22/02 — 26/02

11/02 BT install line. POL get line checked only to find “issues”. I visit site and coil
up line and box above false ceiling metal framework.

01/03 Romec NPG conduct electrical survey. All OK.

04/03 Romec NPG visit site for Horizon Kit deinstall / reinstall with 4 engineers,
however each one has to leave for a period of time during the day to attend a driver
safety course. Delays incurred as existing staff are still using Horizon kit at existing
site and then when kit is deinstalled at old site, PO area not fully ready at new site
(plasterer in new financial room & electrician in fortress area for lighting). Romec do
their best but can’t complete job in 1 day.

05/03 Romec return with 2 engineers at extra cost of £337.26 to finish reinstall off.
Trainer (Richard Cross) also on site. Romec F&S try to install Redcare on line but
fail. Grant Ok for Redcare to be installed on his private line.

06/03 Despite trying to persuade otherwise, Grant opens for business, but Node 3
terminal down and Node 6 at retail area down (screen freeze). Also No Pin Pad /
cradle at Gateway (Node 1) terminal.

08/03 1 visit to find office very busy. Fujitsu engineer turns up but he says he can’t
do anything as the cradle needs to be installed by Romec (and he can’t do this). He
also tries GSM communication on the system but it fails to work (possibly because
the new site has a steel roof). Liam Jones completes an OBC20 for Romec to re-visit
on 11/03. BT turn up to install ISDN (back up for ADSL) but can’t do as they want to
tap off ADSL (which isn’t working fully) and say they will return the following day.

09/03 BT fail to turn up. A later report states that the engineer called at the old site,
despite this unit being empty and a poster saying that the Post Office has re-located 25
yards away. BT re-appointed for 16/03 or 17/03. They re-visit on 18/03

11/03 Romec return to fit Paypole to counter.

12/03 Fujitsu visit.

15/03 Fujitsu visit again and install Pin Pad (into cradle) and Config terminal.

19/03 I visit site. Node 3 terminal working but scanner down.

As a result of the above, the Paystation couldn’t download and thus the terminal was
suspended for a period of time.

On 06/04 Fujitsu report that there had been issues with the servers at Wigan which
could have impacted on ISDN sites.
