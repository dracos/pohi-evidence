Subject: Second Sight Part Two and the Workplan - for tomorrow's meeting with Second Sight

All,

Andy Parsons is sending a comparison document between the part two report second Sight sent round last night and
their previous one. (Andy, could you please send to this copy list for the moment).

We need a handling plan to put to Jane and Mark about how to respond and also how to handle tomorrow's meeting
with Second Sight in terms of the workplan arrangements Jane set out in her letter to Second Sight

If everyone’s in agreement could I suggest that Amanda sets up a meeting for this pm inviting recipients of this email
and perhaps we could use Jane’s room and also have dial in details for those not in the building .

Rod, would you be able to send round the final version of the legal letters as given to Second Sight

Georgia, could you please send round the list of cases you were preparing in relation to what might reasonably fall
within the notice period.

We also need to make a decision about Huddle access going forward for Second Sight and when to change the existing
arrangements which presently leave Second Sight with the access they have always had (no problem with that but we
need to make changes going forward.

Angela, I’ve added you to the list for this in case you want to join or leave it to us for now and we will update you.

Best wishes
