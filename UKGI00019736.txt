Subject: “Post ‘Office mediatio! response to letter from BIS Select Committee

Attachments: 150318 submission Post Office horizon mediation scheme reply to Adrian Bailey.doc; 150318 response to Adrian
Bailey MP.docx; Chair to Vince Cable - Post Office mediation.pdf

Tara, Claire

Please see attached submission and proposed draft response for the Secretary of State to send to Adrian Bailey as Chair
of the BIS Select Committee, regarding the Post Office mediation scheme. I also attached Mr Bailey’s original letter.

In terms of timing, it would be good practice for SoS to reply before the last sitting day of Parliament, so it would be
helpful if the letter could issue on Monday or Tuesday next week if possible.

Very happy to provide any additional information that might be helpful.

Thanks

Laura
