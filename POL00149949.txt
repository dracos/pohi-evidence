Subject: Re: The One Show URGENT

Suggested lines but happy to be talked down:

"It is unfortunate and deeply regrettable that the BBC continues to report on this issue in such a skewed fashion.
The Post Office cannot for legal reasons comment on individual cases and is therefore placed in a intolerable
position when faced with unfounded accusations.

"The business has full confidence in the Horizon system, which deals with xxx transactions a day and is used by
tens of thousands of people without difficulty.

"Given our responsibility to our people, we have agreed to examine the very small number of cases put to us
where postmasters past and present feel they have been unfairly treated. We have set up a Mediation scheme to
consider such cases and even paid for postmasters to prepare their cases.

"In two and a half years since we set up an independent review there is simply no evidence of any systemic issue
with the Horizon system - none at all. Any suggestions to the contrary are extremely serious, without foundation
and damaging to the interests of our millions of customers and all those who use the system every day without
difficulty.

"The Post Office has gone beyond the call of duty in examining these matters and is committed to completing
investigations into all those cases raised with it as part of the Mediation Scheme."

Dear Melanie,

lam sending the detail you requested as an attachment from Nick Wallis and would appreciate it if you
could reply to me (ideally copying Nick in) so that we can properly accommodate the Post Office
response in the film which is transmitting on The One Show this week.

Many thanks,

Jane French
