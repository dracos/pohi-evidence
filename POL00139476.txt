NOTING PAPER: UPDATE ON CMC AND FUTURE WORK STREAMS

This Paper provides an update on the CMC held on 19 October 2017, the directions ordered by the Court
and future work streams. This paper is for noting only.

1. SUMMARY

At the CMC on 19 October 2017, Post Office obtained most of the orders that it was seeking. It secured
its preferred issues for trial and avoided (for now) the Claimants requests for massive disclosure of
documents from Post Office.

The two areas where we were unsuccessful were that (i) the Court re-opened the litigation to new
Claimants and (ii) it refused to order the Claimants to give further information on limitation and settlement
issues.

The full Directions Order is attached. The general thrust of the directions is as follows:

. There will be a Trial in November 2018 regarding the enforceability and fairness of Post Office's
standard contracts. To provide a structure for the evidence to be heard at trial, the parties will
select 6 Lead Claimants. A limited amount of documents with be disclosed in relation to the
Lead Claimants and in relation to certain discrete "generic issues". The Lead Claimants will then
present their claims and Post Office will submit defences to them. The parties will then attempt
to agree a Statement of Agreed Facts for use at tral, failing which each party shall submit its
own evidence by way of witness statements. There will be a further procedural hearing in
September 2018 to check on the preparations for Trial 1.

° There will be a second Trial in March 2019. The parties will submit proposals for the scope of
Trial 2 at the end of July 2018 and the Court will decide on that scope at the procedural hearing
in September 2018. Further directions will then be made for the preparation for Trial 2 through
the period October 2018 to March 2019.

. In parallel with the above, the parties will continue to discuss whether further documents should
be disclosed. There will be disclosure hearings in January / February 2018. These may
indirectly shape and change the scope and preparations for Trials 1 and 2.

. Various other incidental orders were made that were generally advantageous to Post Office.

Overall, the Court has set an intense timetable of actions and given a clear instruction that deadlines
cannot be missed. Although this is manageable, it will require prompt engagement from the business
and may require more PLSG meetings than previously.

2. COMMENTARY ON KEY DIRECTIONS

7 Cut-off date: The Claimants asked the Court to re-open the window in which Claimants may join
the Group Action until 21 December 2017. The Judge decided that the Group should remain
open until 24 November 2017 and we expect that at least 70 more Claimants will join the
litigation (in addition to the current 510). During this period we would expect Freeths to carry out
further advertising.

Post Office's Counsel argued that the Group remaining open was disruptive to the litigation
process and Post Office's business and placed a marker that further extensions of the window
would be inappropriate. The Judge however believed that it is in the interests of justice to allow
as many Claimants into the litigation at an early stage as possible.

4A_37328512_1 1
POL00139476
POL00139476

. Trial 1: A 20 day trial of the Common Issues (see Schedule 1 of the Order) has been scheduled
for 5 November 2018.

The Judge agreed that"Common Issues" should be tried and substantively agreed with the list of
issues proposed by Post Office, which all relate to Post Office's standard contracts.

Prior to the CMC, Freeths conceded that NT Contracts should be considered alongside the 1994
Subpostmaster Contract and at the CMC the parties only had substantively differing views on 6
of the 26 Common Issues. The Judge reached a compromise position on the majority of these
and agreed that the third parties rights claim being brought by those Claimants who are
assistants should be included (an issue which was opposed by the Claimants).

. Pool of Lead Claimants: Going into the CMC, the Claimants were seeking a pool of 10
Potential Lead Claimants from which 6 Lead Claimants would be selected. Post Office sought a
pool of 20 from which to select 10 Lead Claimants. The Judge ordered a pool of 12 Potential
Lead Claimants and 6 Lead Claimants.

We remain concerned that 6 Lead Claimants may be insufficient to cover the Common Issues
and this has been raised in correspondence with Freeths. Please see the separate paper on
Lead Claimant selection process and criteria for further details on this matter.

For the sake of clarity, the Court will not be making decisions on the merits of the claims of the
Lead Claimants. These Lead Claimants are simply vehicles for testing factual propositions to be
determined in relation to Post Office's factual contracts (eg. whether Post Office provided a full
copy of the terms to postmasters before the contracts were signed, etc.)

. Disclosure: The Judge agreed with the disclosure proposed by Post Office, namely disclosing
limited categories of information relating to the Lead Claimants, the documents returned by
Second Sight at the conclusion of the Mediation Scheme and access for the Claimants' expert to
inspect the technical documents held by FJ.

The Judge did not order disclosure of the massive volumes of documents sought by Freeths.
However, the Judge did order that the parties complete an Electronic Disclosure Questionnaire
which will set out in detail the potentially disclosable documents which Post Office holds, the
locations of these and proposals for further disclosure.

Further hearings will be held in January / February 2018 to consider these proposals.

There is therefore still a live risk that Post Office may need to give large volumes of disclosure in
the future.

. Evidence: The Court has ordered that the parties attempt to agree a Statement of Facts to be
used at trial. These are the facts that will set out the background context against which the
Common Issues will be determined.

We are doubtful that the parties will agree this statement given Freeths difficult behaviour to
date. Full witness statements will therefore be needed for trial.

A major point of dispute is the breadth of evidence that is admissible at Trial 1. When
interpreting contracts, there are rules on what types of evidence a Court may take into account.
Broadly speaking, this is limited to evidence of facts that existed before a contract is signed.
However, Freeths are relying on post-contractual issues such as breach of contract by Post
Office and termination of contracts.

Post Office's Counsel set down several markers at the CMC about the importance of this point.
If all of Freeths' evidence is admitted, this would significantly increase the amount of evidence
needed for Trial and may delay the trial date.

° Further Information: The Judge ordered that the Claimants were required to provide further
information on the value of their claims.

4A_37328512_1 2
They were also ordered obtain their medical records to substantiate claims for personal injury.

POL00139476

POL00139476

Whilst the Claimants are not required to disclose these records, it is hoped that obtaining the
records will bring to Freeths' attention that the personal injury claims may well be unsustainable.

The Judge was not willing to order further information to be provided in respect of false
accounting, limitation or settlement agreements. We had hoped to secure this information in
order to setup a basis for striking out claims. He did however make clear that these were
important issues, but that he did not want to deal with them at this stage. There may be an
opportunity to revisit these matters at Trial 2.

4. ADDITIONAL WORK STREAMS

In addition to the above, there are a number of additional pieces of work to be undertaken outside the
scope of the Court ordered actions.

Live Postmaster Claimants. There will be continuing correspondence with Freeths in relation to
Claimants who are live postmasters (i.e. recovery of shortfalls, suspensions, terminations, access to
branches, etc). Please see the separate paper on this matter for further details.

Preparation of evidence. In order to be ready for pleadings in May 2018 and witness statements in

August 2018, we recommend that we being preparing that evidence now. This will involve interviewing

4A_37328512_1
POL00139476
POL00139476

witnesses across the business and potentially some who have left (e.g. Lin Norbury). We anticipate that
this may require interviews with between 30-50 Post Office staff. We will be preparing a list of witnesses
and a timetable of interviews, but would welcome support from across the business in making sure that
Post Office staff are available when needed.

Strike out of claims. Post Office needs to decide whether to strike out the claims of conspiracy and
contravention of human rights — please see the separate paper on this matter for further detail.

Strike out of Claimants. Under the GLO, Post Office has a right to object to any Claimant who does not
fall within the scope of the GLO. Post Office objected to approximately 50 Claimants on the basis that
Post Office was unable to identify them and verify they had a claim which falls within the parameters of
the Group Action. Further information on these Claimants is being sought from Freeths but if this
information is not forthcoming then consideration will need to be given as to whether to strike out these
Claimants. Updates will be provided on this topic as it progresses.

Horizon. Deloitte's work is nearing completion and they have generally reached positive conclusions
that Horizon is robust. However, Deloitte have not reviewed the whole of Horizon and during their work it
was suggested that there is a separate part of Horizon that is notunder the control of Fujitsu. Further
work is ongoing to scope this area and then a plan will be presented to the PLSG for further
investigations if needed.

Merits Advice. Womble Bond Dickinson will be instructing Counsel to prepare a Written Advice on Post
Office's prospects of success at Trial 1. This will be produced in March 2018 once Lead Cases are
known and documents disclosed. It will be updated in September 2018 before Trial 1 but after all
evidence has been filed. This will allow commercial, legal and operational mitigations to be built around
any risk areas.

Settlement. Post Office should consider again whether there is merit in trying to settle this litigation. In
particular, there is an obvious window for a mediation in September / October 2018 to explore the
possibility of settlement before Trial 1 and in light of any risks flagged by Counsel's advice. We will
return to this point in a separate paper at a later PLSG meeting.

General resource planning. Following this PLSG meeting and the decisions on the papers presented,

a resource planning exercise needs to be undertaken, both in terms of internal staff resource at Post
Office and external legal costs. This will be brought back to the PLSG at a latermeeting.

SCHEDULE 1

COMMON ISSUES

References to Subpostmasters in this Schedule are to Subpostmasters who were subject to
either (1) the Subpostmaster Contract (“the SPMC”), or (2) the Network Transformation
Contract (local branch or main branch types) (“the NTC”).

(1)

(2)

(3)

Relational Contract

Was the contractual relationship between Post Office and Subpostmasters a
relational contract such that Post Office was subject to duties of good faith,
fair dealing, transparency, co-operation, and trust and confidence (in this
regard, the Claimants rely on the judgment of Leggatt J in Yam Seng Pte v
International Trade Corp [2013] EWHC 111)?

[GPOC 63, Defence 103]

Implied terms

Which, if any, of the terms in the paragraphs listed below were implied
terms (or incidents of such implied terms) of the contracts between Post

Office and Subpostmasters?
(i) GPOC, para 64 [Denied at Defence, paras 104-106]
(ii) Reply, para. 96.1

(For the avoidance of doubt, the implied terms admitted at Defence para

105 are agreed)

If the terms alleged at GPOC, paras 64.16, 64.17, 64.18 and/or 64.19 are to be
implied, to what contractual powers, discretions and/or functions in the

SPMC and NTC do such terms apply?

Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982

Did Post Office supply Horizon, the Helpline and/or training/materials to
Subpostmasters (i) as services under “relevant contracts for the supply of
services” and (ii) in the course of its business, such that there was an
implied term requiring Post Office to carry out any such services with
reasonable care and skill, pursuant to section 13 of the Supply of Goods and

Services Act 1982?

[GPOC para 63A, Defence, para. 104]

Onerous or unusual terms

Were any or all of the express terms in the GPOC paragraphs listed below
onerous and unusual, so as to be unenforceable unless Post Office brought

them fairly and reasonably to the Subpostmasters’ attention?

(i) para 51.1 and 51.3 (rules, instructions and standards);
(ii) para 52.1 and 52.3 (classes of business);

(iii) para 54.1 and 54.3 (accounts and liability for loss);
(iv) para 56.1.a. and 56.2.a (assistants);

(v) para 60.1 and 60.3 (suspension);

(vi) para 61.1 and 61.3 (termination).

(vii) Para 62.1 and 62.3 (no compensation for loss of office)

[GPOC, para 66; Defence, para. 108]
If so, what, if any, steps was Post Office required to take to draw such

terms to the attention of the Subpostmaster?

IGPOC, para. 66; Defence, para. 108(2)]

Unfair Contract Terms

Were any or all of the terms at paragraph (5) above unenforceable pursuant

What is the proper construction of Part 2, paragraph 4.1 of the NTC?

[GPOC paragraph 49 and 55; Defence, paras 93-94]

Agency and Accounts

Post Office as agent
Was Post Office the agent of Subpostmasters for the limited purposes at

GPOC paragraphs 82 and 83?
[Defence, paras 124-125]

If so, was the Defendant thereby required to comply any or all of the

obligations at GPOC paragraph 84?
[Defence, para 126]

Subpostmasters as agents

Was the extent and effect of the agency of Subpostmasters to Post Office
such that the principles of agency alleged at Defence 91 and 93(2) and (3)

applied as Post Office contends?
[Defence paras 90-91; Reply, paras 59-60]

Did Subpostmasters bear the burden of proving that any Branch Trading
Statement account they signed and/or returned to Post Office was

incorrect?

and/or on what basis was Post Office entitled to terminate on notice,

without cause?
[GPoC, paras 49, 61 and 64, Defence para. 100]

True Agreement

Do the express written terms of the SPMC and NTC between Post Office
and Subpostmasters represent the true agreement between the parties, as to
termination (in this regard, the Claimants rely on Autoclenz v Belcher [2011]
UKSC 41)?

IGPOC, paras 50, 69-71; Defence, paras 86, 110-112]

Compensation for loss of office

On a proper construction of the SPMC and NTC, where Post Office
lawfully and validly terminated a Subpostmaster’s engagement, on notice
or without notice for cause, was the Subpostmaster entitled to any

compensation for loss of office or wrongful termination?
[See GPOC, para. 62; Defence, para. 101]

On a proper construction of the SPMC and NTC, in what, if any,
circumstances are Subpostmaster’s breach of contract claims for loss of
business, loss of profit and consequential losses (including reduced profit
from linked retail premises) limited to such losses as would not have been
suffered if Post Office had given the notice of termination provided for in
those contracts?

[GPOC, para. 131; Defence, para. 171; Reply, paras 81-82]
Subsequent appointments

On a proper construction of the SPMC and NTC, what if any restrictions
were there on Post Office’s discretion as to whether or not to appoint as a

Subpostmaster the prospective purchaser of a Subpostmasters’ business?

[GPOC, para. 62; Defence, para 102]

Assistants

Did SPMC section 15, clause 7.1; NTC, Part 2, clauses 2.3 and 2.5 and/or any
of the implied terms contended for by the parties and found by the Court
purport to confer a benefit on Assistants for the purposes of section 1 of the
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, and if so which of these terms did

so?
