3. Minutes and Matters Arising
4.1 The minutes of the meeting held on 15 July were agréed.

1.2 The status of the Action Points was noted and the meeting was updated with particular
reference to:

Action Point 1: Mr Crahan advised the meeting that the planned detailed presentation of the
future structure of the PDA was no longer appropriate at this time. The way forward would be
influenced bythe recommendations from the Independent Review to be presented at Agenda
Stem 2;

Action Point 2: The means of taking forward commercial negotiations pertaining to the re-plan

. had been discussed at the PDA Board meeting on 23 September. It had been agreed that Mr
Bennett would discuss with Mr Todd and come back with a proposed approach to Mr
McCorkell. It was accepted that the commercial negotiations would follow on from the agreed
plan, requiring strands to be brought together before a detailed approach could be agreed.
However, it was essential that ICL Pathway provided sponsors with early sight of the points of
principle, format and construction of their approach to the commercial] negotiation;

Action 1: Mr Bennett and Mr Todd to discuss their approach to taking forward the

commercial negotiations relating to the re-plan and come back to the PSC with their
proposals.

Action Point 3: Defensive briefings had been provided to all press offices on 6 and 22 August

respectively. Following the Independent Review, Mr Crehan had circulated a further draft
briefing for comment - to be lodged with press offices by the end of the week.

2. Indeperident Review

2.1 Mr Copping of PA Consulting presented a summary of the key conclusions and
recommendations from the Independent Review. Copies of the presentation slides were
distributed at the meeting. .

2.2 The meeting accepted the recommendations and agreed that there was an immediate primary
need to take forward and develop action plans to address the direct causes of slippage identified
in the report ( Tactical Solutions). The Strategic Risks which, whilst falling outside the remit of
the review, must be addressed if the Programme was to avoid any further problems and
command the full commitment of al] parties . The outcome of this work would influence the
evaluation of the strategic options presented.

2.3 In discussion it was agxeed that because of interdependencies, action plans to take forward
* the Tactical Solutions (whilst being addressed by each of the parties) must also provide the end
to end picture. To this end central co-ordination of plans was required.

2.4 Concurrently with the work on Tactical Solutions, all parties would prepare options on the
Strategic Issues and collectively address them. All this work would feed into a review of the
implications of the options contained in the report. A meeting of key influencers in October
would be convened under Chatham House Rules to consider how the Strategic Issues may be
addressed, possible solutions and their impact. It was agreed that Mr Copping would be asked to
facilitate this meeting and that Mr Wylie would act as central co-ordinator for all this next phase
of activity. . . “

2.5 A special meeting of the PDA Board would be convened during week commencing 29
September at which members would agree their action plans for implementing the tactical
recommendations and agree with Mr Copping plans and timescales for the Strategic Risks
Resolution Process, including the format of the Senior Managers’ meeting in October.

Astion 2; Mix Mathison’s office to co-ordinate diaries with Mr Sweetman and Mr Todd to
arrange the dates of the Strategic Risks Conference/Workshop.

Action 3: Mr Wylie to co-ordinate all activities relating to the Tactical Recommendations
Implementation Process and the Strategic Risks Resolution Process.

Action 4: Mr Bennett to arrange the venue for the Strategic Risks
Conference/Workshop.

2.6 The Chairman thanked PA Consulting for their report and confirmed that they had met the
terms of reference of the Review. There was no fundamental disagreement with the content, but
specific points of detail would be fed back to Mr Copping by Monday 29 September for the
final report to be issucd on Wednesday 1 October. The final repott would be annotated “

2.7 The meeting agreed that communications about the Independent Review within the PDA,
sponsor and supplier organisations would be positive. They would. reinforce the collective
commitment of all parties to the Programme proceeding and that, whilst work was being taker
forward to implement the recommendations, momentum must be maintained to deliver current
plans. Mr Crahan would draft a note to PDA Managers for verbal cascade to their teams. This
note would be copied to Mr Rich, Mr Gaskell and Mr Bennett as a template for use in similar

a Review of Testing had been initiated. The Review was being led by the PDA, but fully
involved BA, POCL and ICL Pathway. The joint working group was due to present their initial
findings to Mr Crahan on 30 September when they would also be presenting a plan for the
resolution of major issues. Subsequent to that, an updated version of the end-to-end testing
strategy and new tems of reference for joint testing wouild be produced for presentation to the
PDA Board.

3.1.4 Security Review

3.1.5 An Intemal Review of Security had been conducted and the findings had been discussed
with Mr Coombs of ICL Pathway. Subsequently representatives from ICL Pathway and PDA
Security teams had been tasked with producing joint proposals for ensuring that any security
related problems associated with ICL Pathway Release 2 were identified early and that
appropriate planning activity was undertaken to ensure that Acceptance was not prejudiced.
Joint workshops were being held to take forward this work which would eventually determine a
revised approach to security development and design for future releases.

3.1.5 National Audit Office
3.1.6 The PDA Board had agreed the outline Terms of Reference provided by the NAO for their
proposed study of the Programme. However, all parties considered the timing to be

inappropriate and Mr Crahan would be writing on behalf of the PDA Board and the PSC to the
NAO, via PFD, to advise them as such. .
