Linda, Sue,

Just to advise you I have now completed the appeal paperwork for the incident that took place
at Ibstock on 5/1/06 and my decision in this case is that the culpability amount should be zero.

A letter will go out to the SPMR to advising him of this today special delivery.
Please can you note your records accordingly.

Thanks

John
