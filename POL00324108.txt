Subject always to Post Office's proper observance of its obligations under this Clause,
Fujitsu Services shall indemnify Post Office against all claims, demands, actions,
costs, expenses (including but not limited to legal costs and disbursements on a
solicitor and client basis), losses and damages arising from or incurred by reason of
any infringement or alleged infringement (including but not limited to the defence of
such alleged infringement) in the United Kingdom of any Intellectual Property Right by
the use or possession of the Horizon Service Infrastructure, the Listed Documentation,
Horizon Design Documentation and any documents provided pursuant to paragraph 9
of Schedule 20 (for the purposes of this paragraph 18 together “documentation”) by or
on behalf of Post Office or in connection with the Services.

Fujitsu Services shall promptly notify Post Office if any claim or demand is made or
action brought against Fujitsu Services to which this Clause applies.

Post Office shall promptly notify Fujitsu Services if any claim or demand is made or
action brought against Post Office to which Clause 18.1 may apply. Fujitsu Services
shall at its own expense conduct any litigation arising therefrom and all negotiations in
connection therewith and Post Office hereby agrees to grant to Fujitsu Services
exclusive control of any such litigation and such negotiations. Fujitsu Services shall
consult with and pay due regard to the interests (including the commercial interests of
the Post Office Group and the public interest) and views of Post Office in the conduct
of any defence to any claim or demand hereunder, and shall, where it is reasonable to
do so, comply with such interests and views.

Post Office shall at the request of Fujitsu Services afford to Fujitsu Services all
reasonable assistance for the purpose of contesting any claim or demand made or
action brought against Post Office to which Clause 18.1 may apply or any claim or
demand made or action brought against Fujitsu Services to which Clause 18.2 may
apply. Fujitsu Services shall reimburse Post Office for all costs and expenses (including
but not limited to legal costs and disbursements on a solicitor and client basis) incurred
in so doing.

Post Office shall not make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the defence or
settlement of any claim, demand or action for infringement or alleged infringement of
any Intellectual Property Right to which Clause 18.1 may apply or any claim or demand
made or action brought against Fujitsu Services to which Clause 18.2 may apply.

If a claim or demand is made or action brought to which Clause 18.1 may apply or in
the reasonable opinion of Fujitsu Services is likely to be made or brought, Fujitsu
Services may at its own expense either:

18.6.1 modify any or all of the Horizon Service Infrastructure or the documentation or
the Services (as the case may be) without reducing the performance and
functionality of the same, or substitute alternative products or services of
equivalent performance and functionality for any or all of the Horizon Service
Infrastructure or the documentation or the Services (as the case may be), so as
to avoid the infringement or the alleged infringement but without disrupting the

performance of the Services, provided that the terms herein shall apply mutatis
mutandis to such modified or substituted items or services and such modified
or substituted items shall be acceptable to Post Office (whether by passing any
form of acceptance testing or otherwise), such acceptance not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall reimburse Post Office all
reasonable costs directly incurred by them; or

18.6.2 procure a licence to use the Horizon Service Infrastructure or the
documentation or Services (as the case may be) on terms which afford to Post
Office no more extensive rights than those originally applicable hereunder and
which are acceptable to Post Office and shall reimburse Post Office all
reasonable costs directly incurred by it.

The foregoing provisions of this Clause 18 shall not apply insofar as any such claim or
demand or action is in respect of:

18.7.1 any use by or on behalf of Post Office of the Horizon Service Infrastructure or
the documentation or Services (as the case may be) in combination with any
item not supplied or approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) by Fujitsu Services where such use of the Horizon Service
Infrastructure or the Listed Documentation or Services (as the case may be)
directly gives rise to the claim, demand or action; or

18.7.2 any modification carried out by or on behalf of Post Office to any item supplied
by Fujitsu Services under this Agreement if such modification is not authorised
by Fujitsu Services in writing; or

18.7.3 any use by Post Office of the Horizon Service Infrastructure or the
documentation or Services (as the case may be) in a manner not reasonably to
be inferred from the specification or requirements of Post Office.

If Fujitsu Services has availed itself of its rights to modify the Horizon Service
Infrastructure or the documentation or the Services (as the case may be) or to supply
substitute products or services pursuant to Clause 18.6.1 (or Post Office has
unreasonably withheld its acceptance of such substitute products or services) or to
procure a licence under Clause 18.6.2 and such exercise of the said rights has avoided
any claim, demand or action for infringement or alleged infringement, or if Post Office
has unreasonably withheld its acceptance of any items modified or substituted by
Fujitsu Services in accordance with Clause 18.6, then Fujitsu Services shall have no
further liability thereafter under this Clause 18 in respect of the said claim, demand or
action.

If a modification or substitution in accordance with Clause 18.6.1 above is not possible
so as to avoid the infringement and Fujitsu Services has been unable to procure a
licence in accordance with Clause 18.6.2, Clause 18.1 shall apply.

Post Office hereby warrants and represents that any instructions given in relation to
Fujitsu Services’ use of any third party item supplied directly or indirectly by Post Office
shall not cause Fujitsu Services to infringe any third party's Intellectual Property Rights

POST OFFICE RESPONSIBILITIES

Subject to the provisions of Clause 50 Post Office undertakes to provide at its own cost
and expense to Fujitsu Services, all information, services, facilities and responses
which it is expressed (which may be by cross reference to other provisions of this
Agreement or CCDs) in Schedule 16 that Post Office will provide. Post Office shall use
all reasonable endeavours to perform such Post Office Responsibilities in a timely
fashion in accordance with Schedule 12 and any other agreed timetable specified in
this Agreement. This Clause 26.1 is subject to the specific rules set out or referred to
in Schedule 16 in respect of the NBS or Debit Card.

Without limitation to Clause 26.1, Post Office shall use all reasonable endeavours to
ensure that its Agents co-operate with Fujitsu Services to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit Fujitsu Services to perform the Services. In the event that any
Agent fails to provide such co-operation, and Post Office is unable to secure such co-
operation within six (6) months after receiving written notice thereof from Fujitsu
Services, Fujitsu Services shall be relieved of liability for any failure or delay to perform
the Services which is directly caused by the Agent's failure to provide such co-
operation and shall be entitled to any reasonable additional costs and expenses which
Fujitsu Services can show were directly incurred by it as a result of the Agent's failure
to provide such co-operation.

Fujitsu Services shall not be liable to Post Office for any failure to perform or delay in
performing its obligations hereunder where Fujitsu Services proves that such failure or
delay has been directly caused by the failure of Post Office to perform any of its
obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement or any CCDs. This sub-Clause shall
not apply to Clause 31.2, which shall be governed by the specific rule stated in Clause
31.2.

services to the Post Office Group), or to any Branch any person employed or engaged
by Fujitsu Services, or by a sub-contractor, whose admission would be, in the
reasonable opinion of Post Office undesirable.

If and when directed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall provide a list of the names
and addresses of all persons who it is expected may require admission in connection
with the performance of this Agreement to any premises occupied by or on behalf any
member of the Post Office Group or to any Branch, specifying the capacities in which

may be admitted to such premises and at what times.

If and when directed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall secure that any person
employed or engaged by Fujitsu Services or by a sub-contractor, who is specified in the
direction or is one of a class of persons who may be so specified, shall sign a statement
that he understands that the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 apply to him both
during the term of and after the expiry or termination of this Agreement.

Fujitsu Services’ representatives, engaged within the boundaries of a Post Office Group
establishment or Branch, shall comply with such rules, regulations and requirements

for the conduct of personnel when at that establishment or Branch and when outside
that establishment or Branch.

The Parties acknowledge that the Key Personnel are essential to the fulfilment of
Fujitsu Services’ obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Clause 50, Post Office shall keep the CCD
entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel” (HR/CON/001) confidential in accordance
with the provision of Schedule 6.

Fujitsu Services undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Key
Personnel are not removed or replaced for the duration of the activities relevant to
them (described as “Tasks” in the CCD entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel”
(HR/CON/001). However, in the event that any of the Key Personnel become
unavailable for any reason (including without limitation death, injury, sickness,
promotion or resignation), Fujitsu Services shall have the right upon giving thirty (30)
days’ notice in writing (or such shorter period of notice as may be reasonably
practicable) to Post Office to replace such an individual with another individual whose
abilities and qualifications are appropriate for the services to be performed by such
individual.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that in order for Fujitsu Services to successfully
complete its obligations under this Agreement, additional key personnel may be
identified after the date of this Agreement. It shall be a responsibility of the Forums to
identify and agree any such additional key personnel (together with any activities which

reasonable and genuine pre-estimate of the loss likely to be suffered by Post Office.

in respect of any failure of that LDT and/or SLT; and

29.4.2 Post Office's Additional Costs or liquidated damages payable in respect of any

In the event of any claim or demand being made or action brought to which Clause
30.1 applies, Fujitsu Services shall be promptly notified thereof and Fujitsu Services
shall at its own expense conduct all negotiations for settlement of the same and any

doing and shall not make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the defence of

49. FORCE MAJEURE

49.1 For the purposes of this Agreement the expression "Force Majeure" shall mean any
cause affecting the performance by a Party hereto of its obligations arising from acts,
events, omissions, happenings or non-happenings beyond its reasonable control
including (but without limiting the generality thereof) (i) Governmental Regulations
(subject to Clause 49.7), (ii) fire, (iii) flood, or (iv) any disaster or an industrial dispute
affecting a third party. Any act, event, omission, happening or non-happening will only

CLAUSES Version 2.0
Page 41 of 55

49.2

49.3

49.4

49.5

be considered Force Majeure if it is not attributable to the wilful act, neglect or failure to
take reasonable precautions of the affected Party, its agents or employees, and only if
a substitute third party is not reasonably available (having regard, without limitation, to
the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation. In no event
shall any fraudulent act or omission by any third party or Party in relation to the
Services for which Fujitsu Services is liable under Clause 31.1 constitute a force
majeure event.

Neither Party hereto shall in any circumstances be liable to the other Party hereto for
any loss of any kind whatsoever including but not limited to any damages or abatement
of Charges whether directly or indirectly caused to or incurred by the other Party by
reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement which is due to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party
shall use all reasonable endeavours to continue to perform, or resume performance of,
such obligations under this Agreement for the duration of such Force Majeure event. In
the case of Fujitsu Services, the Parties shall agree an orderly process for such
continuation or resumption of performance (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and Fujitsu Services shall comply with such process. Fujitsu
Services shall remain liable to perform the Business Continuity Services, save where
such Business Continuity Services are themselves also affected by Force Majeure, in
which case Fujitsu Services shall be required to use all reasonable endeavours to
perform such Business Continuity Services.

If Fujitsu Services shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give
rise to or which are likely to give rise to any such failure or delay on its part it shall
forthwith notify Post Office within one (1) Working Day and shall inform Post Office of
the period which it is estimated that such failure or delay shall continue. If Post Office
shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give rise to any such
failure or delay on its part, it shall forthwith notify Fujitsu Services within one (1)
Working Day and shall inform Fujitsu Services of the period which it is estimated that
such failure or delay shall continue.

It is expressly agreed that any failure by Fujitsu Services to perform, or any delay by
Fujitsu Services in performing, its obligations under this Agreement which results from
any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations by any person, firm or
company with which Fujitsu Services shall have entered into any contract, supply
arrangement or sub-contract or otherwise shall be regarded as a failure or delay due to
Force Majeure only in the event that such person firm or company shall itself be
prevented from or delayed in complying with its obligations under such contract, supply
arrangement or sub-contract or otherwise as a result of circumstances of Force
Majeure and there is no substitute person, firm or company reasonably available
(having regard, without limitation, to the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform
the affected obligation.

If any Force Majeure event prevents any Party from performing its obligations
hereunder for a period in excess of ninety (90) consecutive days, Post Office may after
consulting with Fujitsu Services and taking into account Fujitsu Services’ views,
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Clause 34.1.5.

If the performance of this Agreement by either Party be delayed by reason of any Force
Majeure event (as defined in Clause 49.1), both Parties shall be entitled to a
reasonable extension of time subject to there being no entitlement to any additional
costs or expenses incurred as a result of the delay. The Party so delayed shall notify
the other Party in writing within one (1) Working Day of becoming aware of the Force
Majeure event.

Political Risk

Notwithstanding the provisions of Clauses 49.1 to 49.5, a change of, or new,
Governmental Regulation:

49.7.1 shall not entitle Post Office to terminate this Agreement under Clause 49.5, and
any such purported termination shall be treated as a termination for
convenience in accordance with Clause 34.6; and

49.7.2 shall not require Fujitsu Services to perform any additional obligations, or any
reduced or modified obligations resulting in increased cost to Fujitsu Services,
without its agreement in accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

CONFIDENTIALITY

Without prejudice to the application of the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 (where

relevant) to any Confidential Information Fujitsu Services acknowledges that any

Confidential Information (other than its own Confidential Information) obtained from or

relating to Post Office, or its servants or agents, is the property of Post Office.

Each Party agrees to keep confidential, and not to disclose to anyone else, Confidential
Information.

50.2.2 if and to the extent that the other Party has given prior written consent to the
disclosure;

50.2.3 to its professional advisers;

50.2.4 to the extent requested by H.M. Government;

50.2.13which is independently developed without access to the Confidential
Information.

From the earlier of 1 October 2008 and the date on which Post Office serves notice on
Fujitsu Services of its intention to terminate this Agreement, Post Office shall be
entitled to disclose Confidential Information to bona fide potential Next Suppliers of the
Services to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably required to enable any
potential Next Supplier to prepare a reasonably detailed tender proposal to Post Office
in relation to the provision of services equivalent to the Services. Post Office shall
ensure that prior to any Confidential Information being disclosed to any such potential
Next Supplier, such potential Next Supplier shall enter into an Agreed Form NDA and
shall immediately inform Fujitsu Services if it has reason to believe that the potential
Next Supplier is in breach of the undertakings contained in that confidentiality
agreement.

Fujitsu Services hereby agrees that (other than as required by law):

50.4.1 Fujitsu Services (and any person employed or engaged by Fujitsu Services in
connection with this Agreement in the course of such employment or
engagement) shall only use Confidential Information of Post Office for the
purposes of this Agreement;

50.4.2 Fujitsu Services shall take all necessary precautions to ensure that no
Confidential Information of Post Office is used other than for the purposes of
this Agreement by Fujitsu Services' employees, servants, agents or sub-
contractors including, without limitation, obtaining from any such agent or sub-
contractor a signed confidentiality undertaking on substantially the same terms
as are contained in this Clause; and

In the event that Confidential Information is disclosed by any Party to its professional
advisers, that Party shall procure that its professional advisers comply with the
restrictions contained in this Clause, mutatis mutandis.

Nothing in this Clause 50 shall prevent Fujitsu Services or Post Office from using data-
processing techniques, ideas and know-how gained during the performance of this
Agreement in the furtherance of its normal business, to the extent that this does not
relate to a disclosure of Confidential Information or an infringement by Post Office or
Fujitsu Services of any Intellectual Property Right.

REMEDIES CUMULATIVE

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all remedies available to
Fujitsu Services or to Post Office for breach of this Agreement are cumulative and may
be exercised concurrently or separately and the exercise of any one remedy shall not
be deemed an election of such remedy to the exclusion of other remedies.

law, enactment, order, regulation or other similar instrument relating to discrimination
(whether in relation to race, gender, religion or otherwise) in employment.
