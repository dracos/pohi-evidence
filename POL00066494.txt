Post Office Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme
Case Questionnaire

Case Number - M071

David Peter Yates

Introduction

1.1. This Case Questionnaire relates to myself, David Yates, and the issues I encountered whilst I
was employed as Subpostmaster at the Walton-on-Thames branch over the period of
approximately two years until I was audited and suspended on 9 March 2003.

1.2. The format of this document is that I firstly set out some background information that is relevant
to understand the basis of my complaint and my responses to the ten key questions set out in
the guidance notes. I then deal with each of the ten key questions in turn. Attached to this
questionnaire is a spreadsheet which summarises my calculation of the losses that I have
suffered as a result of these issues and the losses I continue to incur.

Background

24. went to work for the Post Office in 1979. Overall in one form or another I
worked for the Post Office for 24 years. I started off as a counter clerk and over time was
promoted until I ended up as the branch manager at the Walton-on-Thames Crown Post Office.
This closed as a Crown office in circa 1996 and I took it on, with a business partner from that

date.

2.2. When the post office was run using a manual process it worked fine. I then went to a
subpostmaster conference and saw a back office IT system for the post office which I acquired
and which also worked well. When Horizon was introduced I presumed it would work in a
similar fashion, Unfortunately this was not the case.

2.3, Unexplained differences starting occurring shortly, say 6 or 7 weeks, after Horizon was
installed. At first I rang the Helpline to see what they could do to help me. Unfortunately they
effectively told me to make good the difference myself.

2.4. It is now a long time ago so I cannot remember the precise details, but believe that I mostly had
cash rather than stock differences. As a branch we had significant cash movements as we
processed cash for a number of local supermarkets.

2.5. The differences increased to a point where it was impossible for me to make good the
differences anyway. Also I do not believe that a member of staff could have taken the money.
Eventually I was audited on 9 March 2003 at which point the difference was approximately
£350,000. I was suspended and criminally prosecuted and received a three year prison
sentence and never went back to the post office again. First of all I was held in Highdown
prison at Banstead for three months and then held at an open prison on the Isle of Sheppey for
a further ten.

2.6. The Post Office demanded repayment of the difference, but there was no way that I could ever
have paid this sum. Eventually I borrowed £41,000 from a friend and offered this amount to the

POL-0062973
POL00066494
POL00066494

Post Office in order to release the charge they had over my house, which they accepted as full
and final settlement. Once this was done I remortgaged in order to repay my friend.

27. could not maintain this once I had

She therefore

2.8. I came out of prison in December 2004 and from January 2005 I started working for my brother-
earned approximately £8,500 a year net from this.
However, he could not afford to keep me going and let me go after about 2% years. Given my
criminal record I found it difficult to get another job and so set up as a delivery a
earn approximately £20,000 a year doing this. My wife has also started to work’,

2.9. Clearly my reputation has suffered immensely and I feel it will never be possible to fully

compensate me for this. In terms of financial losses these are:

« The sum of £41,000 paid to the Post Office in full and final settlement for the difference

» My past and future losses of earnings from the Post Office to my planned retirement at 55.
Attached as Document 1 is a Schedule of Remuneration covering the period from March
2002 to March 2003. This shows that over the period from March 2002 to February 2003 my
net remuneration was £78,378,.70

« My past and future losses of earnings from the non-post office retail activities that were
carried on at the branch. Attached as Document 2 is a set of accounts for my business From
Pillar to Post which I operated at the post office with my business partner Mrs Smale. These
cover the period from 1 October 2001 to 12 March 2003 and effectively cover a period of 18
months. Over this period the business earned £29,261 of which my interest was 50%. This
excluded Post Office income. This additional profit indicates that my non-post office income
was running at something like £10,000 a year gross.

® The loss of capital value from the business that I set up and delivered. I am currently unable
to quantify this with any precision, so have included a relatively conservative estimate of
£100,000.

» My wife's reduction in earnings over a period which directly arose as a result of my
imprisonment.

* Sundry mileage and other expenses incurred as a result of my prosecution.

3. The ten questions

3.1. My specific response to the ten questions set out in the Case Questionnaire and Guidance
Notes is as follows:

What is the main issue or issues you wish us to consider that relate to Horizon or its
associated processes?
3.2. My key issues are as follows:

* The lack of competent and adequate support, via the Helpdesk or by any other means,
which meant that the differences I encountered could not be resolved.

* The inability to "park" and investigate differences and the suggestion that I simply made
good the unexplained differences without fully investigating them. At no point were any other
options made available to me.

POL-0062973
POL00066494
POL00066494

When did the incidents relating to the main issue or issues occur?

3.3. The differences started to occur a few weeks after the introduction of Horizon and continued
until I was terminated in March 2003.

What prior contact have you had with the Post Office in regard to the incidents/issues
that you are now reporting?

3.4. I initially contacted the Helpdesk, but abandoned this as the losses mounted given that they
effectively told me to make them good. I! assume that logs are maintained that could
substantiate my conversations with them.

How was the issue or issues resolved at the time they occurred?

3.5. To start with I tried to make good the loss. However, eventually they grew to the point where
this was no longer possible. Eventually I was audited and prosecuted as a result of the losses
established at that audit visit, which took place on 9 March 2003.

What is the monetary value of the issue or issues you are now reporting?

3.6. Attached is a schedule, which sets out my monetary losses. These include:

® The £41,000 that I borrowed from a friend to settle the claim by the Post Office to settle the
cumulative differences on Horizon of approximately £350,000.

« Sundry mileage costs for my wife to visit me in prison.

® My lost earnings from the Post Office from March 2003 to the present date, together with my
future lost earnings to my planned retirement date. I always intended to retire at 55 and so
have calculated this to 31 March 2017, which is shortly after my 55th birthday.

» My lost earnings from the other activities of From Pillar to Post which I undertook with Mrs
Smale.

» The capital loss of value from the Post Office and shop business that I would otherwise have
been able to realise at my retirement. I have not been able to obtain a detailed calculation of
this and so have included a relatively cautious round sum estimate of £100,000.

* My wife's reduction in earnings over the period during which I was in prison. I have not
included a monetary estimate for this at this stage.

» My legal costs which were in the order of £2,500.

3.7. The losses set out on the attached schedule also do not include any amount to compensate me

for the hurt and suffering and loss of reputation as a result of the inadequacies of the operation
of the Horizon system. I wish to be compensated for this, to the extent possible, as well.

Were you the subject of either civil recovery action or criminal prosecution regarding the
main issue or issues you are now reporting?

3.8. The scale of the differences and the pressure brought to bear meant that I felt I had no choice
but to accept a guilty plea.

How were these actions against you (if any) resolved?

3.9. I was sentenced to three years in prison. I served thirteen months in prison and thirteen weeks
‘on Home Detention curfew.

What is your explanation for the events forming the main issue or issues you are now
reporting?

3.10. I had worked since 1979 as a counter clerk, Branch Manager, and finally a Sub Postmaster. I
never had any problems with balancing until the Horizon system was put in. I know I acted
stupidly by not seeking help about the losses, but I thought the Horizon system would rectify
itself.

Did you request assistance from the Post Office regarding the issue or issues you are
now reporting?

3.11. [did not seek help which I know was a big mistake.
What assistance, if any was provided?
