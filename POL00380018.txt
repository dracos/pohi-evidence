Subject: BIS/govt meetings/read outs

Dear all

As we move towards a greater degree of co-ordination around stakeholder engagement and public affairs, we need as
a business to work more effectively at bringing together our collective knowledge, particularly in the Government
space.

Key to this is a greater degree of discipline around planning of meetings and co-ordination of messaging at such
meetings. Being more aware of what meetings are being held and when will enable us to ensure the right messages
are delivered, and that we can ensure clarity of messaging. There is real reputational risk at play when we don’t have
this oversight.

We also need to be better at sharing the outcomes and insights from key meetings once they have taken place.

Alongside this we are developing a more disciplined and co-ordinated approach to briefing materials, led by Mike
Granville. This will, in time, mean that the business will have to hand a live database — updated on a proactive basis —
setting out our position on all issues affecting us, and also the capacity to develop appropriate briefing on all relevant
issues as we need it.

I will go into more detail on this when I update ExCo on the wider changes to our communications approach. But as a
first step I would be grateful if you could ask your office and your team to ensure:

- That all government (including BIS) and other key stakeholder meetings are communicated in advance to
Leigh Parks, copied (Leigh oversees the planning grid we are developing and will, in turn, share this on a
regular basis with you and your team)

- That short read-outs of all such meetings are sent to Mike and Leigh for appropriate cascade

Your support will also be invaluable as we further develop and populate our database, and I look forward to discussing
further.

Mark
