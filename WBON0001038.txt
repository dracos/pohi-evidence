Subject: Letter of Response to Freeths - Legally privileged [BD-4A.FID26859284]

Kath, Shirley
Please find attached our draft Letter of Response (LOR) to Freeths on the Group Litigation.

This letter responds to the Letter of Claim from Freeths and presents Post Office's legal defence. In doing so, we set
out a number of factual points about Post Office and how it operates. Although this letter has built on the many reports
produced over the last few years, we wish to re-verify that the facts we are putting forward are correct. To that end,
would you both mind carefully reviewing the sections highlighted below to make sure that what we are saying is
correct?

Sections to be reviewed:

e — Section 4A: Factual background to the Post Office and postmaster relationship

¢ — Section 5 in full

e Schedule 4: Background to operation of a Post Office branch

* — Schedule 5: Contract Models and Variations

If possible, please could you provide any comments or amendments by track changes. Please err on the side of
caution — if you're not sure if something is correct, please flag it. Apologies for the short notice but I should be grateful
if could come back with any comments / amendments by cob tomorrow.

In order to preserve legal privilege, please do not circulate the draft LOR to anyone else. You may discuss it with
colleagues if necessary to do so but if you need to forward it to someone else for input, please can you speak to me
first.

Kind regards
Andy
