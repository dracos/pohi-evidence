Branch has a discrepancy of £24000. 4 other branches have had a similar problem in the last 2 months. 3 of
these resolved by remming out the excess. Since these were all branch-to-branch rems and there is no cross-
branch accounting within Horizon, this removes the discrepancy.

It just managed to reproduce this on a test system, by logging into a stock unit which required an immediate cash declaration,
then after printing a declaration receipt leaving the counter to timeout and log me off. Then logged back on, Pouch Delivery,
anual entry. After the 2 delivery receipts were printed I pressed Enter which printed the Rem In slip. Then instead of the
Remittances & Transfers Home’ screen being displayed, the Pouch Delivery screen was still showing, with Enter enabled. Pressing
enter again repeated the rem in and slip print.

jbon’t know whether this can be reproduced reliably, will retry.

f the examples we've seen so far, before the multiple rem ins:
2 counters had inactivity logout after cash dec

2 had system logouts due to lack of connectivity when settling TAs

ny kind of log-out *should* have resulted in ScriptControllerBLO.resetControler() being called (this listens to log off events),
Iso I'd be interested to understand why that's not being called or why the BLO stack is not being reset as a result of log out in
the cases that Anne outlines.

Date:15-Oct-2015 13:09:25 User:Anne Chambers
It have reproduced the second variant too, by creating a TA, logging on, then removing the network cable before pressing Process
TAs. This caused a System Logout. Then I replaced the cable, logged back on, processed the TA then did the rem in as before.

bate:15-Oct-2015 13:24:14 User:Steven Porter

i've had a further look at the code, and it seems to me that the code does not clean up properly if we are force logged off
turing the post-login-checks. More generally, if the user has been authenticated but not completed the log on process completely
(i.¢. has not yet reached the front office home menu) then force log off can leave the CBA in a bad state.

whe issue seems to be around BasichogOffBLO and ApplicationHelperBLO. It seems that ApplicationHelperBLO.abandonApplication() has
Ino effect if the user is in the middle of post login checks. Further careful analysis needed to understand where the issue is.

belts-n-braces change could be to add a call to resetController() when the “log off" event is received in ScriptControllerBLO.
