Bid Approval - Introduction
The Objectives of a Bid Approval Review are as follows:
Review/revise the win strategy as appropriate
Review the critical success factors for the opportunity
Confirm the baseline and ‘deliverability’ of the solution
To approve a price and the basis of the price to be quoted
Ensure that the resource is available to bid and deliver the solution
Secure the authorisation to make an offer or commitment to a customer

To facilitate the achievement of these, the sequence of slides in the presentation template should be retained and no slides
removed from the set. If any slide is felt to be unnecessary for a given opportunity, the blank template should be retained in

sequence.

Review context

« Update PSD on progress with 2 of RMGA's significant
opportunities

* Both opportunities are at an early stage, therefore we
don’t have all the answers

¢ Multiple review due to time constraints

« The success of the Account is dependant on securing
these opportunities — and then delivering them to the
plan.

Globe - UKR&RMG-JRU-55315

+ Business Requirements

+ POL want to introduce a mainstream current account (codenamed “Giobe”)
featuring internet banking etc. in May 2010, in partnership with Bank of Ireland

+ In the past, they've partnered with “White Label” product suppliers, thereby
relinquishing contro! of their sales processes and systems, and losing the
opportunity to invest in reusable I

+ But this new product is big enough to support some strategic investment in
parallel, so POL will underpin “Globe” with a new Service Oriented Architecture
SOA) codenamed “Plug and Play’ — this means an alternative to “White Label”
allowing POL to retain control, and improve IT reuse

POL want to use Globe as a vehicle to enable their Plug & Play strategy

+ POL believe this will make future projects quicker and cheaper to deliver, though
they haven't qualified this view

* The initial load for Globe is based on 85,000 users in year 1, 2 x Data Centres,
1,500 Use Cases, 7 year audit, ...

Opportunity Context

Importance to Post Office

+ Biggest single spend before 2011

* Critical to bringing Post Office into financial balance — a commitment made to
government

« Plug and Play architecture underpins POL's “11-16 Strategy” — increases speed-
to-market, reduces product development costs.

Importance to Fujitsu

+ SOAis the future for our Business Solutions, and a critical-enabler to growing
our AS business. (It was once called “TRIOLE for Applications”)

+ We're short on experience and references, and this project would make a
compelling case study

+ We need our best people on this, for the good of the account and for Fujitsu.

Key Sales Issues

* Credibility problem in Fujitsu delivery of major application projects

* This must become the accounts No.1 priority opportunity for
2009/2010. We must let POL know this.

+ There is a risk that “Plug and Play” (70% + of TCV) might be pulled,
because Globe alone could be delivered much more quickly and
cheaply

+ We know that some of POL’s costs are currently missing from the
business case

* SOA is not yet one of our core capabilities

« Further HNG-X slippage would impact Globe timescale.

Value Proposition (Internal, 1% draft and WIP)

¢ Fujitsu’s existing contract allows POL to avoid OJEU which saves them 3
to 6 months and £800k procurement costs

+ Fujitsu have a proven track record in Horizon delivery and service,
although this has been dented recently

* Fujitsu have the knowledge, capability and resources to link Globe into
Horizon Online, and we have unique experience in working with other
POL systems

+ We have insight and influence into Post Office’s IT strategy

* This prevents a competing apps developer from getting close to our key
customer.

Value Proposition:

Do we sufficiently understand the customers business drivers to ensure that they can see tangible value in our proposals?
True value means that the customer is wiling to ascribe a monetary value to the benefit it brings to them (or add cost to a
competitors proposal).

Can we articulate this in plain language that is easy to understand and assimilate?

It needs to communicated at all levels in the customer organisation with nothing left to chance

Importance to Post Office
* Facilitates independence from RMG and their suppliers
* Cost reduction both immediately and over time

+ POL are hugely supportive of our approach to Service — they want to move our

expertise across the entirety of their estate
+ Managing a single prime will reduce overheads within their business
+ Asupplier with a single view of their estate is seen as a big benefit.

Importance to Fujitsu

* This would protect our current Service from other suppliers

+ Over time this could generate £60m of new TCV

+ Making this a success would gain credibility for us with RVG
