Not quite sure I can see how these answers are going to close down this issue. Who's case is it, might be worth a call
with Fujitsu to discuss and understand more about his challenge.

Andy,

It's Mark Baker in relation to a Mediation Scheme application. He's not technical himself so he's obviously been fed the
questions to ask. He's trying to prove that the comms in branch is causing transactional data to be lost and therefore
resulting in losses to Spmr.

These are very technical questions. Who's asking - was it SS? If so they might well understand the answers. Might need a
call or at least a bit more context. Expanding the abbreviations won't make it any more understandable.

Happy to discuss
Andy

Andy,

This is a bit too technical for me. Are you able to get these answers expanded and without any
abbreviations please?

Thanks

Subject: CT1415a Mediation: Urgent requests

Hi Andy

The following details feedback from one of our’ Core’ Support Groups . If you require expansion or further discussion
via t-con on these updates then please let me .

1. Does Horizon use interleaving of the ADSL line as a default option or is it only used for problem
connections? Eg persistent noise on the line.
Lines use interleaving as default, however there will be sites out there that are on fast profiles due
to some fault investigation, analysis etc

2. Does Horizon use ARQ ( automatic repeat reQuest)
This is an error correction protocol primarily used for live video streaming service, and sits in the
transport layer (TCP, UDP etc) which usually is performed by the router, so very unlikely to be used
by Horizon.

3. Which method of Error Correction is used, Convolutional Coding or Block Coding or a combination
of both?
There are different layers to the service, physical, data link (DSL service) then transport which is the
router. ADSL as a technology uses FEC and CRC at the physical and datalink layers.
