Dear Mrs Williams
Re: Post Office®, Craig Y Don branch

“an essential part of everyday life” www.postoffice.co.uk

I promised to write to you once a comprehensive review had been
undertaken of the issues raised by your constituent, Mr Bates - ex
subpostmaster at Post Office®, Craig Y Don branch. That review has
been completed by a Senior Manager within Post Office Ltd, with
considerable experience in the handling of disputes and subsequent
appeals.

The conclusions of that review, which I fully endorse, are that the
termination of Mr Bates' contract with Post Office Ltd was done
following proper investigation, coupled with both proper warnings and
with appropriate offers of additional training and support. Additionally,
no evidence was found which, in any way, substantiates the various
claims being made by Mr Bates.

It is clear to me that the decision to terminate Mr Bates' contract was
not only correct, but that it was the only sensible option.

It is my view that the best interest of all involved with this matter would
be best served by considering the matter closed.

Yours sincerely

Richard Barker
General Manager, Commercial Network
