I should be grateful if could review the attached very short document, which will form part of our response to the Letter
of Claim. It addresses a very specific point around Post Office's / Fujitsu's capability to change branch data (which
overlaps with your work).

Apologies for the short notice but please could you again come back with any comments by close tomorrow.

Kind regards

Andy
