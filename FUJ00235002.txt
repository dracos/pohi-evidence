‘ion Service: Service Description

1. Service Summary

4.1. Fujitsu Services will provide a Reconciliation Service to ensure financial integrity across all
Transactions processed through the HNG-X System. Reconciliation of these Transactions is
completed (a) to ensure all Transactions processed by a Branch are correctly sent to the CFS
System and (b) to ensure that there is a reconciliation between:

1.1.1. Transactions sent to APS Clients and the CFS System; and
1.1.2. Transactions sent to Banks and the CFS System, namely:
a. deposits into and withdrawals from bank accounts;
b. Removed by CCN1725a;
c. debit and credit card Transactions; and
d. Electronic Top Up (ETU) Transactions.

1.2. The Reconciliation Service will provide a number of Reports to Post Office giving a statement of
reconciliation across the agreed boundary points within the HNG-X System.

1.3. Where Fujitsu Services is unable to reconcile any Transaction referred to in section 1.1 (such
Transaction then being referred to as an 'Exception'), such Exception will be identified and
reported to Post Office and progressed to resolution by the Reconciliation Service.

1.4. Where Post Office is unable to reconcile any Transaction referred to in section 1.1 (such
Transaction then being referred to as an 'Error’), Post Office shall inform Fujitsu Services and
such Error will be progressed to resolution by the Reconciliation Service.

2 HNG-X

2.1 Service Definition

In addition to the responsibilities detailed below, the Reconciliation Service is responsible for Transaction
Corrections received from Post Office being made visible to Branches via the Branch Database.

N.B. There is no formal reconciliation produced between the CFS System and the Credence transaction
stream. The Credence stream should therefore not be used to verify financial integrity and Post Office
should ensure the CFS System Transaction information is used for this purpose.

2.1.1. Removed by CCN1747

2.1.2 APS Reconciliation

2.1.2.1. The APS Report set and the APS reconciliation have been designed to ensure APS Transactions
completed in Branches are reconciled with the Transaction stream received by the CFS System to
enable settlement to be made with Clients. Full details of the format and content of this Report set
can be found in End to End Reconciliation Reporting (SVM/SDM/SD/0020).

2.1.2.2. Reconciliation of APS Transactions will include reconciling any zero value Transactions i.e. the
number of APS Transactions where there is no value attached. While these Transactions do not
affect financial reconciliation they will be reported in instances where they were not properly
transferred to APS Clients or the CFS System.

2.1.2.3. The APS Report set will be produced daily by the Reconciliation Service to reconcile those
Transactions sent to both the CFS System and APS Clients.

2.1.2.4. In addition to any Exceptions discovered by the Reconciliation Service within the APS Report set,
Errors may be discovered by Post Office when reconciling data within the CFS System or responding
to queries from APS Clients.

2.1.2.5. The investigation and resolution of APS Exceptions and Errors shall be dealt with through the
BIM reconciliation procedure. Such procedure shall be initiated by the creation of Business Incidents
(as defined in section 2.1.4) for one or more Exceptions and/or Errors in accordance with the
provisions of section 2.1.4.

2.1.2.6. Where an APS Exception or an Error does not affect reconciliation within the CFS System, no
liquidated damages shall be payable by Fujitsu Services.

2.1.2.7. There is no formal reconciliation between Credence and APS Clients. Financial integrity shall
therefore only be reconciled between the CFS System and APS Clients.

2.1.3 Banking & Related Services Reconciliation

2.1.3.1. The Banking & Related Services Report set has been designed to enable LINK, Global
Payments UK, and Epay transactions, or any other financial transaction identified by Routing
Gateway, completed in the Branches to be reconciled; to allow settlement to be made with Clients, or
direct settlement to specific Clients and/or Banks. Full details of the format and content of the Report
set can be found in End to End Reconciliation Reporting (SVM/SDM/SD/0020).

2.1.3.2. The Reconciliation Service will produce the Banking & Related Services Report set for each of
the Transaction streams referred to in section 2.1.3.1 of this Reconciliation Service: Service
Description, in accordance with the rules documented within End-to-End Reconciliation Reporting
(SVM/SDM/SD/0020).

2.1.3.3. The Banking & Related Services Report set will reconcile all the individual Transaction
components constituting a Banking & Related Services Transaction.

2.1.3.4. In addition to those Exceptions reported by Fujitsu Services within the Banking & Related
Services Report set, Errors may be discovered by Post Office when reconciling data within its own
systems or responding to queries from Clients.

2.1.3.5. The investigation and resolution of Banking & Related Services Exceptions and Errors shall be
dealt with through the BIM reconciliation procedure. Such procedure shall be initiated by the creation
of Business Incidents (as defined in section 2.1.4) for one or more Exceptions and/or Errors in
accordance with the provisions of section 2.1.4.

2.1.3.6. Where a Banking & Related Services Exception or Error does not affect reconciliation within the
CFS System, no liquidated damages shall be payable by Fujitsu Services.

Data Reconciliation Service

2.1.3.7. The Banking & Related Services reconciliation system shall enable reconciliation of Transactions
arriving at the Data Reconciliation Service Host (DRSH) from the following sources:

(a) [C12] data copied from the BRDB
(b) 4 separate types of files:
1) areconciliation file from VocaLink,
2) +anumber of EMIS files from Global Payments UK

3) aDTF file from EPay (i.e. D Messages and C4 Confirmations) (flows b and c are
alternatives), and

4) EPA files from Amex.
2.1.3.8. Removed by CCN1676a.

2.1.3.9. The Reconciliation Service shall monitor the Transactions and report Banking & Related Services
Transaction states which are:

(a) in error, in that their occurrence implies malfunction in end to end Banking & Related
Services Transactions; or

(b) in error in that an expected state has persisted for an unexpected duration (e.g. where C4
Confirmations are received from LINK, Global Payments UK, and Epay, or any other financial
transaction identified by Routing Gateway, but the confirmation from the counter has not
been received after an abnormal delay),

whilst identifying any such erroneous Banking & Related Services Transaction states which require
human analysis for resolution.

Complete Processing

2.1.3.10. The Banking & Related Services reconciliation system shall ensure that all data received
by it is processed and checked for completeness of Transactions together with reporting Exceptions
for resolution by the Reconciliation Service.

2.1.3.11. The Banking & Related Services reconciliation system shall not regard a Banking &
Related Services Transaction as complete until reported as such in accordance with End to End
Reconciliation Reporting (SVM/SDM/SD/0020).

2.1.4 Reconciliation and Incident Management

Business Incidents

2.1.4.1. A Business Incident is defined as the ‘symptom’ of an underlying cause — e.g. the effect of the
system fault on the resulting reconciliation or settlement information sent to Post Office.

2.1.4.2. A Business Incident can relate to one or more of the Exceptions reported within “End-to-End
Reconciliation Reporting” (SVM/SDM/SD/0020) or one or more of the reconciliation or settlement Errors
discovered by Post Office.

System Incidents
2.1.4.3. A System Incident is defined as the underlying ‘cause’ of a Business Incident.

2.1.4.4. A System Incident is created to track the root cause of a Business Incident. Depending on the
impact, nature and scope of the Business Incident the POA Problem Management Procedure
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0025) may be invoked. However, if the nature of the Business Incident is agreed to be
a low priority or a ‘one off’, the BIM reconciliation procedure will suffice. The choice of procedure shall be
determined by discussion and agreement between Post Office and the Reconciliation Service for specific
Business Incidents as they occur.

2.1.4.5. Where there are associated System Incidents and Business Incidents, their relationship can be
either:

(a) one to one;
or

(b) one to many, respectively.

Incident Originators

2.1.4.6. Business Incidents will be raised by:

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN

(a) the Reconciliation Service for Exceptions reported via the APS and Banking & Related
Services Report sets;

(b) Post Office for any other reconciliation or settlement Error discovered by Post Office that
has not been reported by the Reconciliation Service;

and

(c) the Third Line Support Service for any system fault, file or Transaction rejection which
cannot be repaired electronically or data base adjustment which is considered by Fujitsu
Services to have a reconciliation or settlement implication within Post Office.

2.1.4.7. Subject to agreement by Post Office and Fujitsu Services to the contrary, Branch raised calls to
the Post Office Limited IT Service Desk (ITSD) will not generate Business Incidents.

2.1.4.8. The ITSD will, however, monitor potential reconciliation issues from Branches if it is considered
necessary by Fujitsu Services.

Raising of Business Incidents

2.1.4.9. In line with the generic Incident Management Policy agreed between Fujitsu Services and Post
Office, Post Office generated Business Incidents will only be recognised as such if raised via the ITSD.
This ensures that the Business Incident is properly logged, enabling the Reconciliation Service to ensure
that corrective information can be supplied and any underlying system fault can be rectified.

2.1.4.10. In all cases the Reconciliation Service will raise a BIM Report to log Business Incidents in
accordance with the Working Document entitled Reconciliation and Incident Management, Joint Working
Document (SVIM/SDM/PRO/0012).

BIM Reports / MER

2.1.4.11. The BIM system has been designed to report the progress to resolution of a Business Incident
to allow Post Office to complete an accurate reconciliation or settlement with its internal systems, Clients
and Banks.

2.1.4.12. A BIM Report shall always include details of a MER and give details of the Transaction causing
the Exception or the Error. Depending upon the nature of the Exception or the Error, Fujitsu Services may
be liable to pay liquidated damages to Post Office in lieu of any financial cost that Post Office may incur
to resolve the Business Incident, either internally within the CFS System, or as part of a settlement
adjustment with its Clients or Banks. Details of how and when liquidated damages are applied to MER
are set out in section 2.3.4 of this Reconciliation Service, Service Description.

2.1.4.13. A BIM Report is deemed to be ‘cleared’ when the Reconciliation Service has provided the
information required to enable full reconciliation to take place.

Resolution

2.1.4.14. Where the Reconciliation Service corrects an Exception or an Error, one Business Incident will
be raised to cover each Exception or Error which has been corrected, or a group of related Exceptions, or
group of related Errors. A BIM / MER Report containing appropriate information will be issued relating to
that Exception or group of Exceptions, or Error or group of Errors.

Resolving the underlying cause of Business Incidents

2.1.4.15. If required, Fujitsu Services will complete a system fix to resolve the underlying cause of a
Business Incident. The Parties shall agree the implementation and timing of this system fix in
accordance with the Problem Management Procedure (SVM/SDM/PRO/0025).

Amending centrally held data

2.1.4.16. If the Reconciliation Service identifies that Transaction data held on the ‘central database’
located at the Data Centre is found to be inconsistent when compared to the records of the Transaction
that was completed at the Branch, e.g. a receipt, a Transaction log or a Branch accounting discrepancy,

the Reconciliation Service shall obtain authorisation from Post Office prior to the insertion of corrective
Transactions.

2.1.5 Service Management

2.1.5.1. Continuous Service Improvement

Post Office and Fujitsu Services will, as part of ITIL service management best practice, work together to
identify opportunities for elimination of duplicated effort and rationalisation of processes with the aim of
delivering improved efficiency and / or cost savings as referred to in section 1.4 of the CCD entitled
Service Management: Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

2.1.5.2. Service Reporting

The Reconciliation Service will, as required, provide service reporting for distribution to Post Office as
required under the Service Management Service described in the CCD entitled: Service Management:
Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

2.1.6 Notes on Reconciliation with CFS

The Branch Database is the initial repository of all HNG-X business transaction data and all other HNG-X
Systems and other systems that receive HNG-X data must reconcile with this source. In doing so, the
Reconciliation Service proves that each system reconciles with all the other systems.

Branch Database sends financial transaction data to CFS that is sourced from the daily transaction store.
In order to prove the completeness and correctness of the financial information, the Branch Database
also sends a product movement summary to CFS that is sourced from the branch ledger store. These
two interfaces will be compared by CFS and exceptions raised if there are discrepancies between the
two. Since CFS is nota service operated by Fujitsu, it is not the responsibility of Fujitsu to raise such
exceptions. Any incidents that POL would like Fujitsu to investigate will be dealt with as described in
