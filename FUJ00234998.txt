1 Service Summary
14 The Systems Management Service comprises:

@ An event management service;

* Asystems monitoring service; and

* A Software distribution service.
1.2 Each element described in section 1.1 is deployed to the HNG-X Central Infrastructure, but not

to the Replaced Branch Infrastructure, and for those elements of the HNG-X System migrated
to Post Office Cloud only for the HNG-X Application and not for the infrastructure used to
deliver the Post Office Cloud, according to a central service delivery capability within the
Systems Management Service. Logs of events from the Replaced Branch Infrastructure will be
collected and stored as part of the audit records.

For AppDynamics Agent Software installed onto platforms within the HNG-X System the
Systems Management Service shall not provide event management, monitoring services, or
software distribution services. None of the elements of the Service Management Service
described in section 1.1 shall be delivered for the AppDynamics Agent Software.

1.3 Operational staff will be appropriately trained to carry out the Systems Management Service.

1.4 The Systems Management Service is based on remote unattended resolution. Monitoring,
under the Systems Management Service will, seek to minimise interruptions to the normal
business operation of the Branch Infrastructure.

15 The System Management Service shall carry out system management of the Business
Capabilities and Support Facilities. The activities within each Business Capability and Support
Facility shall be co-ordinated such that, for example, changes and faults can be tracked across
Business Capability and Support Facility boundaries.

1.6 Changes to the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities shall be made on the request of
the Release Management Service in accordance with Annex A of the CCD entitled: “Service
Management Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

17 The Systems Management Service activities within the Data Centre shall be co-ordinated such
that, changes and faults can be tracked across the respective Business Capabilities and
Support Facilities.

1.8 Not used.

2.1 Service Definition

2.1.1 Event & Systems Monitoring

2.1.1.1 The Systems Management Service will provide event and systems monitoring of the HNG-X
Central Infrastructure and those elements of the HNG-X System migrated to and hosted within
the Post Office Cloud, that is only for the HNG-X Application and not for the infrastructure used
to deliver the Post Office Cloud. Events are the indications of conditions that have operational
significance. They include Software, Hardware or security conditions that may require
investigation and also include occurrences of particular, repeated events. Investigations will
involve either other relevant Operational Services or a defined recovery procedure.

2.1.1.2 All new platforms within the HNG-X Central Infrastructure will have the appropriate level of
performance monitoring Software installed and this will be available to the Systems
Management Service to enable systems monitoring to take place.

2.1.1.3 Fujitsu Services will ensure that all access to the HNG-X Central Infrastructure will be by
approved scripts that have predetermined functionality. Access is role based by SMC staff and
access is controlled by Safenet IKEY, which is fully audited by the CS Security Team.

2.1.1.4 The Systems Management Service includes the above Event & Systems Monitoring for active
POL Service Types (for example Collect & Returns Support Service).

2.1.2 Software Distribution

2.1.2.1 The Systems Management Service will distribute Software to the HNG-X Central Infrastructure
and to the Post Office Cloud for those elements of the HNG-X System migrated to and hosted
within it, in accordance with direction from the Release Management Service detailed within
Annex A of the Contract Controlled Document (CCD) entitled: “Service Management Service,
Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

2.1.2.2 Where an update to the Branch Infrastructure Software is required, new or updated Software
may need to be deployed and remotely installed across the HNG-X Telecommunications
Infrastructure to a specific Branch, all Branches, or a group of Branches. The distribution
process separates the transfer of Software from its subsequent installation, thus enabling the
installation process to take effect from a particular date or time. Updated Software can be
reversed out.

2.1.2.3 The Systems Management Service will maintain Software repository management through the
update of a Software inventory database which identifies which Software versions are stored on
the components of the Branch Infrastructure and the HNG-X Central Infrastructure.

2.1.2.4 The Systems Management Service includes the above Software Distribution for active POL
Service types (for example Collect & Returns Support Service).

2.1.3. Time Synchronisation

2.1.3.1 The Systems Management Service provides a time synchronisation service to, the Replaced
Branch Infrastructure, until such time synchronisation service is replaced by the time
synchronisation service provided by or on behalf of Post Office for the Post Office Cloud, and
the HNG-X Central Infrastructure. For the avoidance of doubt, the Systems Management
Service does not provide time synchronisation service to the infrastructure used to deliver the
Post Office Cloud. All platforms have access to an accurate time source and this access is
configured to ensure a consistent date and time across all Branches. This caters for the
handling of clock changes at the beginning and end of British Summer Time.

2.1.4 Operational Change Proposals

2.1.4.1 The Systems Management Service will create and/or impact Operational Change Proposals in
accordance with section 2.1.6 of the CCD entitled: “Service Management Service, Service
Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

The Systems Management Service will provide event and systems monitoring of the HNG-X
Service Infrastructure with status and system event notifications.

Where a system or network condition has been identified, the Systems Management Service
will raise an appropriate Incident via the Service Desk or directly via the Incident management
systems at the required severity to enable the issue to be resolved in accordance with the
document entitled: “POA Operations Incident Management Procedure” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018).

Major Incidents will be managed in accordance with the Working Document entitled: “POA
Operations Major Incident Procedure” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001).

Continuous Service Improvement

Post Office and Fujitsu Services will, as part of ITIL service management best practice work
together to identify opportunities for elimination of duplicated effort and rationalisation of
processes with the aim of delivering improved efficiency and / or cost savings as referred to in
section 1.4 of the CCD entitled “Service Management Service, Service Description"
(SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

Service Reporting

The Systems Management Service will provide service reporting for distribution to Post Office
as required under the Service Management Service described in the CCD entitled: “Service
Management Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD0007).

Capacity Management

Fujitsu Services will ensure that the system is capacity managed. To support this action, the
Systems Management Service shall be responsible for:

(a) Providing immediate alerting on performance issues that could jeopardise the live
service;

(b) Providing lower priority alerting for performance issues, which while not jeopardising the
live service, indicate a problem that needs to be investigated;

(c) Conduct medium and long term trending to allow potential problems to be forecast in
advance;

(d) Liaising closely with the Capacity Management Service, as documented within the CCD
entitled: “Service Management Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007) Annex
B, regarding the actual Data Centre performance with current traffic volumes;

(e) Reviewing, with the Capacity Management Service, the forecasted traffic volumes to
assess the future capacity requirements of the Data Centre Operations Service; and

(f) Ensuring adequate controls are in place to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to run
the Service.

Service Availability

The service is not directly available to Post Office. It is a service internal to Fujitsu Services and
is available 24/7, 365 days per year.
