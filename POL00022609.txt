have (SS’s original terms of engagement) is highlighted in yellow — do you have a copy of that?

Let me know if you think I have missed any.

Communication to Subpostmasters regarding raising concerns with Horizon for initial Second Sight Investigation
Press Release announcing the establishment of the Scheme

Letter to Subpostmasters about the Scheme

SS terms of engagement

Mediation Pack

Press Release announcing the appointment of Sir Anthony Hooper

I would like to attend if that's ok and there's nothing in my diary on Thursday which can't be shifted to another slot
currently.

Rod - please do feel free to send any drafts of the instructions if.you think I might be able to help.

Mark - could you send Rod the list of documents you and Lorraine had identified as constituting those which 'set up’ the
scheme ?

Thanks very much all
Patrick

Great.

Jonathan Swift is available for a con on Thursday, but sitting as a judge on Friday.

I'm sure we can get instructions to him by close of play Monday, so I'll contact the clerks to start teeing it up.
From our side, who do we want to go, and what is their availability like on Thursday?

It's hard to choose between the two QC's but I will go for Jonathan Swift. I am also content with the proposed scope of
the enquiry. So we can now set the wheels in motion.

Dear Tim
Project Sparrow

At our meeting on 25 September, you asked me for recommendations as to leading barristers who
would be well placed to advise and assist in your enquiry into the Post Office’s handling of this issue,
together with suggested wording to describe the scope of your enquiry.

QCs

Attached are the CVs of two leading QCs. Both are currently available and, would in my opinion, be
suitable to advise you having regard to the nature of the issues raised by Project Sparrow, Post Office’s
position as a corporate entity in public ownership, and your responsibilities as a new director and
Chairman of Post Office Limited. So far as Iam aware, neither of these QCs have previously advised Post
Office.

Subject to your views on these candidates, I recommend that we approach your preferred candidate on
your behalf next week such that he is available to advise you on the question of scope on your return
from holidays.

Suggested Scope
The following is my suggested text to describe the scope of your enquiry:

“To review the Post Office’s handling of the complaints made by sub-postmasters regarding the alleged
flaws in its Horizon electronic point of sale and branch accounting systems, and determine whether the
processes designed and implemented by Post Office Limited to understand, investigate and resolve those
complaints (including through the Complaints and Mediation Scheme), were reasonable and
appropriate.”

In order to provide your selected adviser with sufficient background to advise on the scope, I suggest
that we provide to him a copy of the letter from Baroness Neville-Rolfe, and a selection of materials
produced by both third parties and Post Office which outline the nature of the concerns that have been
raised by interested parties including Lord Arbuthnot and the Justice for Sub-postmasters’ Alliance, as
well as details of the process that has been followed.

On your return from holiday, the QC should then be in a position to provide you with advice on the
scope of the enquiry, how this is framed, the process by which such enquiry should be conducted, and
the nature of your final report to the Minister. To this end, I note your desire that the review be
completed by Christmas.

I look forward to hearing from you which QC you would prefer to brief, and whether the draft scope of
the proposed enquiry seems appropriate at this stage. My direct line is set out below if you would like
to discuss any of this first.

Kind regards,

Jane
