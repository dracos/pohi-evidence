Scanned document from mr7 (Post Office - list of potential witnesses) [WBDUK-AC.FID26896945]

Hi ladies

Would one of you be able to assist with this task?

From the pdf list, I have written next to paragraph numbers the individual witnesses who can speak about the topics
contained in the paragraphs. (Some paragraphs do not have anyone's name written next to them — please ignore
these paragraphs).

I have started to copy and paste the paragraphs the witness can speak to into the attached word document named
“List of potential witnesses" so that we have a summary for each individual about the key topics they can talk about.

Please could you complete this list. There should be a total of 13 potential witnesses.

Any questions, do give me a shout. If this could be done today, that would be a great help!

Many thanks

Mandy
