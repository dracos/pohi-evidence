I, SIMON GEOFFREY OLDNALL, of 100 Wood Street, London EC2V 7ER, say as

follows:
Introduction

1. I am the Horizon IT Director at Post Office Limited ("Post Office"). I have been
employed by Post Office since September 2020 in this role. This is my second
Witness Statement to the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry ("the Inquiry").

2. This witness statement has been prepared in response to the 48 " request made
to Post Office by the Inquiry pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006, dated
10 October 2023 (the “Rule 9 request"). I provide with this witness statement
a separate note from the Post Office in relation to questions 3(e) and (f) of the
Rule 9 request."

3. Consistent with the Rule 9 request, I use "Fujitsu" to refer to Fujitsu Services
Limited and ICL Pathway Limited, the latter having been acquired by Fujitsu Ltd
between 1990 and 1998 and re-branded from April 2002. I use Post Office to

refer to the current Post Office organisation and its predecessors.

4.1 have sought to include within this witness statement evidence relating to
matters or issues detailed in the Rule 9 request insofar as the relevant facts are
within my own knowledge. I have also prepared a glossary of terms referred to

in this witness statement.

5. The facts in this witness statement are true, complete and accurate to the best

of my knowledge and belief.

6. The Rule 9 request sought evidence relating to some matters and issues that
are not within my knowledge. As a result, where my knowledge has been
informed by another person or by documents that I have reviewed for the
purposes of preparing this statement, I will specifically acknowledge the identity
of the individual concerned or the nature of the documents. By way of example,
the Inquiry will see at paragraph 33 that I have set out in some detail the
approach that I took to preparing my response to questions 3(b)-(d) of the Rule
9 request, due to my lack of any personal knowledge of the matters that are the
subject of those questions.

7. I have been assisted in preparing this witness statement by Burges Salmon LLP
and Fieldfisher LLP (together "BSFF"), who act on behalf of Post Office in the
Inquiry (other external advisers also act for Post Office) and external counsel.

8. Where I refer to specific documents in this statement, copies of those documents

have (where possible) been produced to the Inquiry.

9. In drafting this statement, and as agreed with the Inquiry in correspondence

regarding the approach to the Rule 9 request, I have referred the Inquiry

3 POL00424366

Page 3 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

(whether in the body of the statement itself or in the footnotes) to a single or
small number of examples of documents that explain the processes and
procedures that Post Office had in place during the periods that are the subject
of the Rule 9 request.

10. In some instances, there are other examples of these types of documents that
have been located during the review process for this Rule 9 response. Where
Post Office has identified such documents, I have not referred to them all in the
statement but I confirm that Post Office has disclosed them to the Inquiry. I
make it clear at the outset that Post Office has not conducted searches in order
to identify every example of every type of document, e.g. every set of meeting
minutes or papers for every forum. As agreed with the Inquiry, such an exercise

was beyond the scope of the Rule 9 request.

My role at Post Office

11.1 joined Post Office in September 2020, prior to this I was employed for 20
years by a number of consultancy and technology companies, primarily
focussed on the delivery of technology enabled change programmes in the UK
and overseas. Before then, I spent 10 years in the UK civil service working for
the DWP, its predecessors and related agencies.

12. In my role as IT Director for Horizon, I am responsible for:

a. managing the Post Office Horizon Leadership team and working with
third party suppliers involved in the Horizon IT system (“Horizon”), which
is made up of various sub-teams which focus on different aspects of the

Horizon IT System (including Postmaster Experience, Commercial

Page 4 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Management, Quality Assurance, Horizon Live Services, Remediation
and Change as well as Security, Risk & Investigations).

b. designing and implementing changes following the GLO litigation to
ensure that Post Office IT takes steps to resolve issues identified in the
Horizon Issues Judgement.

c. supporting the Post Office Group Chief Digital Information Officer
(“CDIO”) and forming part of the Post Office Technology Leadership

team.

Question 3(a) - Post Office’s position on the nature and extent of the relevant

contractual obligations and how they changed over time.

13. In paragraph 2 of the Rule 9 request, “relevant contractual obligation” is defined
as meaning any contractual obligation owed by Fujitsu to Post Office Limited

(or its predecessors) in relation to:

a. the identification, investigation, recording and reporting of (i) bugs, errors
and defects in the Horizon IT system; (ii) other network and system
failures or (iii) the impact of such events upon branch accounts
(‘paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9 request”);

b. the adoption of measures to rectify bugs, errors and defects in the
Horizon IT system (“paragraph 2(b) of the Rule 9 request”);

c. the use of access rights and privileges by Fujitsu employees to remedy
errors in transaction data and branch accounts (paragraph(c) of the Rule

9 request).

14. There have been four overarching contracts between Post Office and Fujitsu,
which are as follows:

Page 5 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

a. Preliminary Contractual Agreements: 15 May 1996 — 28 July 1999

b. The “Original Codified Agreement": 28 July 1999 — 31 December 2002
[o The “2002 Agreement": 31 December 2002 — 31 August 2006.

d. The “Current Contract’: 31 August 2006 — present.

15. There is limited corporate memory and documentation in relation to the history
of the Post Office and Fujitsu contract. As a result, the detail and information
that it has been possible to include within this statement has been compiled
through the review of documentation that has been identified for the time
periods detailed above and through discussions with individuals who do still
have some corporate knowledge regarding the matters that are the subject of

the Rule 9 request.

Preliminary Contractual Agreements

16. On 15 May 1996, the Secretary of State for Social Security acting through and
on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Services for Northern Ireland
("DSS") entered into an agreement with Post Office for the development and
establishment of computer services by Fujitsu. The agreement consisted of

three individual contracts which can be summarised as follows:

a. An agreement between the DSS and Fujitsu for services relating to a

benefit payment card system ("the DSS Agreement").

b. An agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu for the provision of Post

Office infrastructure and other service ("the POCL Agreement").

Page 6 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

c. An agreement between DSS, Post Office, and Fujitsu for the supply of
other general services which applied to both DSS and Post Office ("the

Authorities Agreement").

17. Following delays to the development and deployment of services under the
Preliminary Contractual Agreements, a review of the project was carried out
and was led by HM Treasury and involved both the DSS and the Department
of Trade and Industry ("DTI"). Thereafter, on 24 May 1999, Post Office and ICL
Pathway entered into a Letter Agreement which set out how the relevant
aspects of the POCL Agreement and the Authorities Agreement would be
codified into a single agreement (not involving the DSS), to reflect a new
commercial relationship between Post Office and ICL Pathway. The Codified
Agreement was the result of the exercise carried out pursuant to the Letter

Agreement.

Original Codified Agreement

18. The Original Codified Agreement was in force from 28 July 1999 to 31

December 2002.

19. The Original Codified Agreement was subsequently amended through 11

different versions which are as follows:

a. Original Codified Agreement Version 1, 28 July 1999: POLO0399924.
b. First Supplemental Agreement, 20 August 1999: POL00393858.

(ol Second Supplemental Agreement, 24 September 1999: POL00325269.
d. Third Supplemental Agreement 18 January 2000: POL00324066.

e. Version 1.1, 28 July 1999.

Page 7 of 255

iG Version 1.2, 30 November 1999: POL00393858.
g. Version 1.3, 14 April 2000: POL00028202.

h. Version 1.4, 25 July 2000: POL00393914.

i. Version 2, 12 January 2001: POL00043749.

j- Version 3, 19 September 2001: POL00337516.
k. Version 4, 25 June 2002: POL00394103.

I. Version 5, 30 October 2002: POL00337524.

20. The relevant contractual obligations can, in the main, be found in the Original
Codified Agreement. I have therefore endeavoured to identify relevant
provisions within the Codified Agreement and the associated schedules that
contain those relevant contractual obligations. Where the nature and extent of
the relevant contractual obligations changed over time, pursuant to further
versions of the Codified Agreement, I have detailed the changes under a sub-
heading that specifies the Version or Schedule to the Agreement through which

the changes were made.

First version of the Original Codified Agreement

21.1 have detailed below the provisions from the first version of the Original
Codified Agreement (and the associated Schedules) that set out the nature and
extent of the contractual obligations. I have specifically listed any clauses,

paragraphs or annexes in which the obligations are contained.

22.1 have also set out, where it has been possible to do so, in respect of each
contractual provision, the corresponding contractual provision to which it relates

as detailed in paragraph 2 of the Rule 9 request.

Page 8 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

23. The provisions of the Original Codified Agreement that, in my assessment,
relate to relevant contractual obligations are detailed below. I assess that all the
clauses detailed below fall within the scope of the relevant contractual

obligations defined within paragraph 2(b) of the Rule 9 request.

a. Clause 210 - Further Releases — Sub-clause 210.2: "Fujitsu may
issue further releases of software as necessary to remedy defects in the
provision of the POL services for the purpose of maintenance of the POL
service infrastructure."

b. Clause 411 — Acceptance of Core System — Sub-clauses 411.2 to
411.4 (see paragraph 104(b) for acceptance requirements): "Fujitsu
agrees that if, following Core System Release ("CSR")* Acceptance, any
fault arises in connection with the Core System which was not identified
as an Acceptance Incident but might reasonably have been expected to
be identified as an Acceptance Incident prior to this agreement then
Fujitsu shall remedy such fault at their expense. Faults are categorised
at Schedule A11".

(om Clause 507 — Risk in Products — Sub-clause 507.3: "Fujitsu shall as
soon as possible rectify any loss or damage affecting the Core System
Products and proceed/complete the installation of the POL service
infrastructure and performance in line with this agreement."

d. Clause 810 - Limitation of Liability - Sub-clause 81.13: "/f in
connection with POL's performance of its responsibilities re in-office data

migration, there is a breach of integrity or any viruses enter any system

4 The original Horizon system implemented in 1999, which consisted of three major components as
detailed in ‘ICL Pathway Core System Release Contents Description’ (POL00393881): Automated
Payments Services, Operational Business Change Services and Electronic Points of Sale Services.

or disk which is provided by a Fujitsu laptop computer, then POL is not
liable to Fujitsu nor will it terminate the agreement as a result of any
delay or reduction in service levels if such breach or viruses could not
have been avoided or mitigated by Fujitsu."

e. Schedule A11 -— Acceptance Procedure for Core System. The
paragraphs of the Schedule as detailed below all, in my assessment,
engage the contractual obligations as defined in paragraph 2(a) of the

Rule 9 request:

i. Paragraphs 2.1-2.3: These paragraphs deal with the criteria that
the CSR must meet in order to pass the Acceptance Test. This
is the process, defined in an Acceptance Procedure, for
determining whether a Service meets the relevant Acceptance
Criteria, and is therefore sufficiently effective to be evaluated by
the Release Authorisation Board for national rollout. Paragraphs
2.1—2.3 stipulated that the associated thresholds for passing the
Acceptance Test may not be met if the threshold of Acceptance
Incidents is exceeded. Acceptance Incidents are an unusual or
undesirable occurrence, or a request for advice and guidance,
which are reported in writing by Post Office to the Contractor
(Fujitsu) for analysis. Schedule A11 divides Acceptance

Incidents into three categories® and stipulates the thresholds for

5 Schedule A Paragraph 7.1 defines these Acceptance faults as follows:
Category (a) failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion essential to the Deliverable or POCL
Service shall be designated a high severity deficiency;
Category (b) failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is highly desirable for the
Deliverable or POCL Service shall be designated a medium severity deficiency;
Category (c) failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is desirable for the Deliverable or
POCL Service shall be designated a low severity deficiency.

Page 10 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

failing the Acceptance Test. These are one or more high severity
(category (a)) faults or more than 20 category (b) faults generally
or more than 10 category (b) faults in respect of any one CSR
Acceptance Criteria. If faults were identified, then a CSR
Acceptance Test was repeated following corrective work by
Fujitsu and Post Office would have the right to test for and raise
new faults which may be caused by that corrective work or may
only come to light because of the corrective work.

Paragraphs 3.1-3.2: These paragraphs provided that if CSR
Acceptance was not achieved at the end of the trial review
period, Fujitsu would be entitled to a period of 3 months to
remedy the defaults at its own expense. Should CSR Acceptance
not be successfully achieved at end of the second testing period,
then Post Office would have the right to terminate the agreement.
Paragraphs 7.1-7.2: These paragraphs outlined that Fujitsu was
required to analyse each Acceptance Incident and categorise an
incident within the set of principles listed. To summarise, these
principles contain descriptions such as ‘essential’, ‘highly
desirable’ or '‘desirable' in relation to the deliverable or Post Office
service. Depending on the description applied, each Acceptance
Incident would be categorised as either 'low, medium or high
severity deficiency.’ Alternatively, it may have been classed as
another Acceptance Incident which did not fall under one of the
defined acceptance criteria detailed above, but which identified

a failure to meet any other obligation under the Codified

Page 11 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Agreement and represented a substantive equivalent fault.
These paragraphs also noted that an analysis of an incident by
Fujitsu will not by itself be sufficient by way of resolution. The
paragraphs go onto state that resolution will only occur when the
deficiency or fault has been corrected by Fujitsu and repeated
tests occur thereafter without failure.

iv. Annex 1 to Annex 11: These annexes provided detail around
the Acceptance Tests that have been referred to above, which
were tests to check whether any change or update to the system
achieved the targets detailed in the given Acceptance
Specification approved by Post Office. These tests were required
to take the form of one or more trials and reviews. Trials were
referred to as including inspecting, demonstrating, running a real
or simulated workload and monitoring a particular system being
tested over a trial period to verify the system is working correctly
and providing the required service to Post Office. A review was
defined as including inspections of a system or specific
deliverable and Post Office and Fujitsu meeting to review the

results.

Schedule A15 — Requirements, all of which I assess to engage the
relevant contractual obligations as defined in paragraph 2(c) of the Rule

9 request:

i. Paragraph 1.11 — Requirement 473 This requirement outlined

that any remote access or access to system should be restricted

Page 12 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

to users specifically authorised by Post Office. It also stated that
it shall be possible to restrict the functionality available at an
“outlet’. An "outlet" in this context refers to a Post Office branch.
There was also a provision that ensured there should be a secure
and reliable mechanism for users to suspend and resume access
to the system.

Paragraph 1.19 — Requirement 481: This requirement set out
that Post Office should provide instructions for transaction
support to outlets and details of what to do in emergency
situations such as the failure of the Post Office service
infrastructure.

Paragraph 1.58 — Requirement 524: This requirement outlined
that the help desk service should deal with calls relating to the
hardware including fault diagnosis, maintenance call out,

caretaking advice and configuration management.

Paragraph 1.60 — Requirement 526: All reported incidents were
required to be resolved in line with Service Levels — which was a
quantified and measurable standard defined in a series of
Service Level Agreements (“SLAs”) that were revised during the
term of the Codified Agreement.

Paragraph 1.70 — Requirement 537: This required Fujitsu to
carry out system management to ensure changes and faults
could be tracked across service boundaries and any changes
made to the Post Office services were made speedily and

accurately.

Page 13 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

vi. Paragraph 1.101 -— Requirement 698: Pursuant to this
requirement, Fujitsu was required to set up an organised security
infrastructure which encompassed virus control, control of
software, reporting incidents and the management of fraud and

risk during service operation.

vii. Paragraph 1.122.6 - Requirement 818: This requirement
provided that the Electronic Point of Sale Service ("EPOSS")
needed to include features to check internal consistency, report
errors, warn of non-critical errors and prevent critical errors,
refuse deletions if there was dependent business data which
would lead to inconsistency of data within the Post Office service
infrastructure, check data consistency and report exceptions.

viii. Paragraph 1.124 — Requirement 820: This requirement dealt
with EPOSS functionality which included providing a means of
controlling user access to data, processes and functions,
maintaining the integrity of the system, ensuring ongoing service
consistency and ensuring that following an incident there was no
corruption of secured data and that a full recovery was effected
as soon as possible in an auditable manner. Furthermore, the
requirement stated that EPOSS would ensure that the committal
process for a transaction was robust and consistent so that a
service interruption did not result in an unrecoverable error.
Further, it provided, in the event of any failure of any part of the
Post Office service infrastructure, that recovery should be

performed with minimum disruption to the user and EPOSS

Page 14 of 255
xi.

WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

would warn the user where there was a possibility that data had
been corrupted.

Paragraph 1.134 - Requirement 830: Pursuant to this
requirement, Fujitsu was required to ensure that all Post Office
services were supported by contingency plans including fallback
transactions that minimised or negated the impact of a failure in
any of the Post Office services based on impact and risk
assessments which included a testing strategy.

Paragraph 1.136 — Requirement 832: Fujitsu was required,
pursuant to this requirement, to agree with Post Office, before
the roll out of EPOSS, that the capture of data at the outlet was
complete, accurate and robust. This was necessary to ensure
that in the event of fraud, it should be possible to prove that Post
Office services were operating without defect and for appropriate
transactions receipts to be automatically generated for
customers, a copy retained in the outlet for customers, and a
copy retained to allow recovery or problem resolution. Further,
pursuant to this requirement, an outlet would be able to maintain
an audit trail in the event of any failure of the Post Office service
infrastructure.

Paragraph 1.149 — Requirement 891: Fujitsu was required,
pursuant to this requirement, to report reconciliation results to
Post Office, including any discrepancies. Any differences,
doubtful items or errors were to be resolved by Fujitsu and

reconciliation reports and the identification of doubtful items and

Page 15 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

errors were to be delivered to Post Office by 9am the following
day. Fujitsu was to make all reasonable endeavours to resolve
any doubtful items and errors promptly.

xii. Paragraph 1.150 — Requirement 894: Fujitsu was, pursuant to
this requirement, to provide Post Office with details of any Post
Office service infrastructure failure or file corruption and
information to enable Post Office to monitor and/or manage
service levels.

xiii. Paragraph 1.163 - Requirement 913: This requirement
provided that contingency and/or disaster recovery
arrangements and user documentation containing information on
what to do during a service failure should be available to all

users.

xiv. Paragraph 1.164 — Requirement 914: This requirement outlined
Fujitsu's obligations to provide a help desk service to Post Office
and how Fujitsu will be responsible for providing a problem

management system dealing with any failures in the system.

g. Schedule A16 — Solutions:

i. Reference Number 468 (which I assess to engage the
obligations contained within paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9
request): All faults were to be diagnosed with the aid of expert
systems by the Horizon System Helpdesk. This paragraph then
went on to set out that a field engineer would visit to assist with

any fault.

Page 16 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Reference Number 472 (which I assess to engage the
obligations contained within paragraph 2(b) of the Rule 9
request): The system was to ensure data security and integrity
was maintained in the event of failures of the Office Platform
Service ("OPS") which was the IT equipment provided by Fujitsu
that allowed for the entire range of business at Post Office outlets
to be performed.

Reference Number 523 (which I also assess to engage the
obligations contained in paragraph 2(b) of the Rule 9
request): Fujitsu was to provide agreed levels of support to
resolve problems associated with Fujitsu's operational services.
Reference Number 524 (which I assess to engage the
obligations contained in paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9
request): The Horizon System Helpdesk service was required to
manage all calls relating to the operation, configuration and end-
user support of counter terminal equipment, their operating
systems, software, application software and processes. Calls
were to be categorised and the Helpdesk would provide problem
and fault diagnosis and control any necessary hardware or
software maintenance activities.

Reference Number 526 (which I assess to also engage the
obligations contained in paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9
request): Fujitsu was required to ensure all reported incidents
were resolved within agreed service performance levels and in

conformance with agreed operational procedures. A

Page 17 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

comprehensive analysis of all incidents, their cause and
resolution and the service levels achieved was to be produced
for review.

vi. Reference Number 830 (which I assess to engage the
obligations contained in paragraph 2(b) of the Rule 9
request): This section dealt with contingency planning and
outlined that Fujitsu, in co-operation with Post Office, would
ensure Post Office services were supported to minimise or
negate the impact of failure in any part of the Post Office services
including but not limited to basing those plans on impact and risk
assessments.

vii. Reference Number 914 (which I assess to engage the
obligations contained in paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9
request): The Horizon System Helpdesk would provide
assistance and fault management to users and Post Office's
clients. It outlined the various categories of service calls and how
each different level would prompt a different action. By way of
example, the level 3 service was invoked when a call could not
fully resolve an issue and required escalation to a higher level of
technical support or an engineer to perform a maintenance visit.
It also provided detail around the operational services of the

Horizon System Helpdesk.

h. Schedule F05 — EPOS Service Management — Paragraph 6 (which I
assess also engaged the obligations contained in paragraph 2(a) of

the Rule 9 request): Fujitsu was required to provide Post Office with

Page 18 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

service management reports which included service failures, incidents
resolved and outstanding, and the review of ongoing actions such as
fault correction.

i Schedule G01 — POL Infrastructure Service Definition - Paragraph
6 (which also, in my assessment, engaged the obligations
contained in paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9 request): This paragraph
outlined the functions of the Horizon System Helpdesk Service which
included: acting as a central point of information on the working state of
the POCL Services; keeping customers notified of any scheduled
interruptions to the service; assisting in the negotiations between the
client and Post Office where interruptions were scheduled; and keeping
Post Office informed®. The information on the problem management
system was to be updated as the problem progressed, and each update
should have been accompanied by the details of when it was
implemented, what was changed, who made the change and if it was a
solution that was accepted by the customer.

j. Schedule G07 - POL Infrastructure Service Management —
Paragraph 6 and Schedule KO05- LPS Service Management —
Paragraph 7 (engaging again, in my assessment, the obligations
within paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9 request): These paragraphs

largely repeat much of the detail in Schedule FO5 above, in that they

6 Schedule G01 Paragraph 6.4.1 states that these include, but are not limited to: a) unique problem
serial reference, generated automatically by the problem management system; b) customer contact,
address, location and telephone number; c) date and time problem occurred; location and telephone;
d) date and time problem was reported to the Horizon System Helpdesk; e) Horizon System Helpdesk
contact ; f) description of the problem, including frequency of occurrence; g) serial references of similar
faults and previous occurrences; h) Hardware Equipment involved ; serial number etc .;i) Software
product and release version; j) assessed impact on customers business; k) priority for solution; I)
problem category; m) estimated elapsed time to solve problem; n) any change of referral point; 0) date
and time of referral.

Page 19 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

outline service reporting, the relevant time scales in which a report
needed to be provided and what it needed to include.

k. Clause 210 - Further releases — Paragraphs 3.3.1 and 4.3.1
(engaging again, in my assessment, the obligations within
Paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9 request): In the event that any of the
minimum acceptable service targets were not met, Fujitsu was required
to provide Post Office with an analysis of the reason for the failure and
both Fujitsu and Post Office were required to then agree a rectification

and improvement plan to address the failure.

First Supplemental Agreement

24. The First Supplemental Agreement amended some of the provisions of the
Original Codified Agreement. I have detailed the amendments that, in my
assessment, are or relate to the relevant contractual obligations referred to in

section 2(b) of the Rule 9 request below:

a. Amendment to paragraph 3.1 of the 1999 Original Codified
Agreement: As CSR Acceptance was not achieved by end of CSR
Operational Trial Review Period, Fujitsu was entitled to a period of three
months from 16 August 1999 in which to remedy the outstanding defaults
at its own expense and to re-submit the Core System Release in its
entirety for the second CSR Acceptance Test. However, the agreement
stated that the only elements of the Core System Release required to be
resubmitted for testing in the Second CSR Acceptance Test were those

relating to outstanding faults.

Page 20 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Amendment relevant to paragraph 7.1(a)-(c) of the Original Codified
Agreement: Paragraph 3.3 of the First Supplemental Agreement
addressed the categorisation of new faults that might arise during the
testing process. It stated that no faults that had arisen prior to end of
CSR Operational Trial Review Period could be raised as a Substantive
New Fault unless the nature of fault, in Post Office 's reasonable opinion,
had changed or its effect, impact, seriousness or frequency had been
greater since the end of CSR Operational Trial Period to the extent that
it had, in Post Office's reasonable opinion, a material adverse effect on
Post Office's business or operations. However, the provisions of the
Original Codified Agreement relating to faults appear to have been made
less onerous for the purposes of obtaining CSR Acceptance in the
Second CSR Acceptance Test. Although a Substantive New Fault
categorised as category (a) would prevent CSR Acceptance (and mean
that Post Office had the right to terminate the Agreement), no
Substantive New Fault categorised as category (b) would count towards
the threshold of 10 category (b) Faults in one area or 20 category (b)
faults overall (as detailed in para 2.2(ii) of Schedule A11) - thereby
making it less likely that the right to cancel would ultimately end up being
triggered. In addition, a failure to agree a timetable to resolve a category
(b) Substantive New Fault arising after 3 September 1999 would not
prevent CSR Acceptance — despite the provisions of para 2.1(iv) of
Schedule A11 of the Original Agreement. Any new category (b) faults
arising after 3 September 1999 needed, pursuant to the amendment, to

have a timetable for resolution agreed by the parties by 15 November

Page 21 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

1999, in default of which either party could request an expert to specify
such a timetable, which was binding on parties. If any substantive new
category (b) faults remained by 17 September 1999, Post Office would
not withhold its agreement to a timetable for resolution proposed by
Fujitsu, if the expert has stated in writing that Fujitsu's rectification plan
was likely to resolve the fault by date specified therein and resolution by
that date would not, in the expert's opinion, be likely to mean that the
fault would not have a material adverse effect on Post Office's business

or operations.

Second Supplemental Agreement

25. Two sections of the Original Codified Agreement were the subject of
amendment in the Second Supplemental Agreement. These sections, in my
assessment, are or relate to the relevant contractual obligations as defined in

section 2(a) of the Rule 9 request. They were:

a. Paragraphs 3.1-3.6: The paragraphs set out new arrangements and a
timetable for the resolution of faults that had failed the initial Acceptance
Test but had timetables for resolution (as referred to in Part B of
Schedule 1, with each Incident’s corresponding rectification Timetable
detailed at Schedule 2).’ Paragraph 3.6 introduced new obligations in
relation to errors in transaction records or cash account stream records
which were caused by faults with the Horizon system -- and not caused

by users inputting invalid data in outlets or erroneous reference data

7 Schedule 2 of the Second Supplemental Agreement details a rectification plan that is 5 pages long
which contains reference to various Acceptance Incident Numbers that were created pursuant to that
Agreement.

Page 22 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

supplied by Post Office. Specifically, Fujitsu was to issue a Manual Error
Report to Post Office.® If the number of errors exceeded 20 in any week,
Fujitsu was to review the process introduced by the accounting integrity
control release with a view to enhancing the process and correcting root
causes of errors. Thirty days after the end of each month, Fujitsu was to
pay Post Office for its costs in dealing with the Manual Error Reports in
relation to erroneous reference data provided by Post Office and to co-
operate with Post Office to investigate and resolve such discrepancies.
b. Paragraph 7.1 introduced an Integrity Checking Process for Post
Office's Transaction Information Processing System through which Post
Office would carry out a check of cash account discrepancies by
comparing data it received across the TIP Interface with electronic cash
account data it received from Fujitsu. This new paragraph imposed a
charge of £229 payable to Post Office by Fujitsu for each discrepancy

reported to Fujitsu.

Third Supplemental Agreement

26. Paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 of the Third Supplemental Agreement contained
provisions that, in my assessment, are or relate to the relevant contractual

obligations as set out in paragraph 2(b) of the Rule 9 request:

a. Paragraph 5.2 imposed a new contractual obligation on Fujitsu in

relation to incident types that were defined in Schedule 4. This obligation

8 The process of issuing Manual Error Reports concerned what are described as “reconciliation

principles’ and branch accounts were one of many streams of financial information that were processed

through the Horizon system and needed to be reconciled. As a result, it could be any aspect of that
financial information, including errors with branch accounts, that could be the subject of a Manual Error
Report.

Page 23 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

required Fujitsu to develop, test, deploy and provide Post Office ..with
reporting in relation to cash account discrepancies.? Fujitsu was also
required to develop, alongside Post Office, tools, processes and
procedures to address reference data issues in relation to certain listed
incidents under Schedule 4.

b. Paragraph 5.3 imposed a new obligation on Fujitsu to, at Post Office's
request, have an expert explain the root causes of Cash Account
Discrepancies that had not been detected by the Accounting Integrity
Control Release and set out measures that should be introduced to
prevent these in future.

c. Schedule G01 — POCL Infrastructure Service Definition —- Paragraph
2.2 established agreed improvements to the helpdesk and a timetable
for implementation of these improvements as set out in Schedule 1. One
of these improvements was a new Helpdesk Forum which was to have

a representative from Post Office.

27.\In preparing this statement in response to the Rule 9 request, I have also
reviewed the subsequent versions of the Original Codified Agreement but in my
view these subsequent versions do not contain any further provisions that are
new relevant contractual obligations or amend existing relevant contractual

obligations.

The 2002 Agreement

° The Codified Agreement defines “Cash Account Discrepancies’ as differences which arise when the
cash account composed by Post Office from individual transaction data sent across the Transaction
Information Processing (“TIP”) interface is compared with the electronic cash account retrieved from
Fujitsu.

Page 24 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

28. On 31 December 2002, the Original Codified Agreement was replaced with the

2002 Agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu. There were a total of 7

versions of the 2002 Agreement which are detailed below:

a.

Original 2002 Agreement, 31 December 2002 (POL00325101)

Version 2, 6 August 2002 (POL00324108)

Version 3, 5 November 2003 (POL00324122)

Version 4, 26 August 2004 (POL00324132)

Version 5, 5 July 2005 (POL00324165)

Version 6, 30 November 2005 (POL00324169)

Version 7, 15 August 2006 (POL00324187).

29. It is my assessment that only the following clauses from that version are, or

relate to the relevant contractual obligations:

a.

Clause 6.2: This Clause provided that Fujitsu could issue further
releases of software from time to time as necessary to remedy defects
in the provision of the services or for the purpose of maintenance of the
Horizon Service Infrastructure or the applications. It is my assessment
that this clause engages the contractual obligations contained in
paragraph 2(b) of the Rule 9 request.

Clause 9.3.1: All components of the Horizon Service Infrastructure were
required to operate in accordance with their respective specifications,

except that, for the avoidance of doubt, it was agreed that Post Office

Page 25 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

should have no remedy for a breach of this undertaking in relation to
errors or interruptions to services which were caused by a failure of a
Service Level Target (“SLT”) or an Additional Remedy Level (“ARL"®.”)
It is my understanding that what this meant in practice was that Post
Office would not be able to allege a contractual breach by Fujitsu (or
pursue Fujitsu for associated remedies for any such breach) but could
pursue it for SLT or ARL remedies. It is my assessment that this clause
engages the contractual obligations contained in paragraph 2(a) of the
Rule 9 request.

Cc. Clause 17.1:

i. Clause 17.1.2: Fujitsu was required to preserve the integrity" of
the Post Office’s data once Fujitsu has received it, and Fujitsu
was required to prevent any corruption or loss of that data. “POL
Data” is defined in the Interpretations section as any data that
Fujitsu was granted access to under the Codified Agreement;
which was generated by the Horizon system; or which Fujitsu

generated while performing its obligations under the Codified

‘° Schedule 15 to the 2002 Baseline Version defined "Service levels and Remedies". The Schedule
defined up to three thresholds in respect of each Service Level as follows:

1.1.1.The level of Service ("Service Level Target" or "SLT") required from Fujitsu Services by Post
Office. Not all SLT failures give rise to payment of liquidated damages.

1.1.2 The level of Service which, if not achieved by Fujitsu Services, shall give rise to payment of
liquidated damages by Fujitsu Services (the "Liquidated Damage Threshold" or "LDT"). Payment of
liquidated damages notwithstanding, a failure of any LDT shall not (on its own) constitute a Default.
1.1.3 The level of Service below the SLT and (if applicable) the LDT which, if not achieved by Fujitsu
Services, shall give rise to payment by Fujitsu Services of Post Office's Additional Costs or liquidated
damages as described (where relevant) in this Schedule (the "Additional Remedy Level" or "ARL".)
"In this context, I believe it would have meant that there was a requirement that Fujitsu ensured that
the data was not amended or changed.

Page 26 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Agreement. Therefore, this included, but was not limited to, the
financial data generated by SPMs using the Horizon System. '
ii. Clause 17.1.3: In the event that POL Data was altered, corrupted

or lost in the course of performing the services, Post Office had

the option, in addition to any other remedies, to:

a) Clause 17.1.3.1: require Fujitsu at its own expense to
restore or procure the restoration of the POL data; or

b) Clause 17.1.3.2: itself restore or procure restoration of the
POL data, and be repaid by Fujitsu any reasonable

expenses so incurred.

d. Schedule 15 — Service levels and remedies. The paragraphs of this
Schedule which I refer to below all, in my assessment, contain
contractual obligations of the kind defined in paragraph 2(a) of the Rule

9 request:

E Paragraph 2.4 provided that all levels of service should be
monitored on a weekly and monthly basis and any failure to meet
a service level assessed over that month should be reported to
Post Office by means of a monthly Service Review Book detailing
all Service Levels and the actual levels of service achieved.

ii. Annex 2 - Data delivery service levels:

"2 These include:
“Application Interface Specification Reference Data to Pathway for CSR+” (BP/IFS/010)
“ICL Pathway/Post Office Interface Agreement for Operational Business Change - Product”
(CS/PRD/058)
“ICL Pathway/Post Office Interface Agreement for Operational Business Change - Branch”
(CS/IFS/003)
“Debit Card MoP Functional Specification” (EF/SER/001)

Page 27 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Paragraph 1.4: This paragraph and sub-paragraphs detailed
Fujitsu's obligations to arrange and undertake a visit to a branch
to recover transaction records and to assess whether there had
been a failure of service levels. Where Fujitsu had been unable
to arrange a visit with a branch for reasons of delay on part of
the branch, then the period of delay would, pursuant to this
paragraph of the Annex, be disregarded and would not be held

against Fujitsu.

iii. Paragraph 3.3.3: If any of the Service Level Targets in this
paragraph were not met, Fujitsu was to provide Post Office with
an analysis of the reason for the failure. Fujitsu and Post Office
then were to agree a reasonable rectification and improvement
plan to address the failure.

iv. Annex 3 Banking Services — Paragraph 2.2.1: Fujitsu was
required to record and calculatie the number of Core Network
Banking (“NB”) Service System Faults which caused the NB
system not to be available in any one or more Branches. The NB
system is the application which supported banking transactions
in Post Office branches, which the Interpretations Schedule
states is defined in the CCD ‘NBS Definition’®

v. Annex 4 Miscellaneous Services - Paragraph 2: This

paragraph provided that the delay between the occurrence of a

8 POL00394114

Page 28 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

data error and the issue of a manual error report should not

exceed five working days.

Schedule 24 — Banking Implementation. The paragraphs of this
Schedule all, in my assessment, engage contractual obligations of

the kind defined in paragraph 2(a) and (b) of the Rule 9 request:

(i! Paragraph 5.3.1.2: Fujitsu was to provide Help Desk support to
resolve technical faults in Horizon Service Infrastructure.

ii. Paragraph 5.8.2: Fujitsu was to notify Post Office in writing as
soon as reasonably practicable after Fujitsu became aware of
any PP Dependency Failure or any matter which would result in
such failure. PP dependency related to the provision of PayPal
and PIN pad services in Post Office branches.

iii. Paragraph 6.3: The 2002 Agreement's provisions concerning
the Acceptance of the Network Banking Service were similar to
the 1999 Agreement’s provisions concerning CSR Acceptance
(see paragraph 104(b) for section on acceptance). If Fujitsu
failed to Achieve NBS Deployment by the NBS Release
Complete Date, this would represent a Default. Fujitsu would
have to agree a reasonable time in which to rectify the Default
with Post Office. If they failed to meet this revised deadline, the
Default would give Post Office the option to terminate the
Agreement under Paragraph 8.6.4. As was the Case with CSR
Acceptance, Network Banking Acceptance Incidents were

categorised according to their severity — and thresholds for each

Page 29 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

level of severity were established. If these thresholds were
exceeded, then the Network Banking Service would not meet the

criteria for Acceptance. Specifically, these thresholds were:

a. No outstanding High Severity NBS Acceptance Incidents at
the Release date;

b. Five or less outstanding Medium Severity Incidents at the
NBS Acceptance Date (which required an agreed
rectification plan);

c. There was no threshold for the number of Low Severity
Incidents — although these should have had a target date to

be resolved.

iv. Paragraph 6.4: This paragraph deals with the raising of NBS
Acceptance Incidents. It addressed how Fujitsu was to raise
these if a trial failed, a document subject to a NBS review failed
to meet the criteria or where any other trial or pilot did not meet
the criteria. It also included a table of severity classifications for
each incident and measures such as repeat testing, rectification

plans.

. [have reviewed Version 1 of the Current Contract and assess that the clauses
detailed below engaged the relevant contractual obligations. It is my
understanding that there have not been any revisions of these provisions

since.'4

a. Clause 12.2: This clause provided for further releases of software by

Fujitsu from time to time as necessary to remedy defects in the provision

‘4 As was the case with the Original Agreement, the Current Contract can only be amended in
accordance with the Change Control Procedure as set out in Schedule A3.

WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

of the services or for the purpose of maintenance of the infrastructure,
the Horizon Applications and the business capabilities and support
facilities. It is my assessment that this Clause engages the contractual
obligations as defined in paragraph 2(b) of the Rule 9 request.

Clause 15.1.9: All components of the infrastructure were required to
operate in accordance with their respective specifications, except that,
for the avoidance of doubt, it was agreed that Post Office should have
no remedy for a breach of this undertaking in relation to errors or
interruptions to services which caused a failure of a SLT or an ARL.
Clause 33.1 (which, I assess, engages contractual obligations as

defined in paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9 request):

i. Clause 33.1.2: Fujitsu was required to preserve the integrity of
the POL data once Fujitsu has received such data, and to prevent
any corruption or loss of that data. Fujitsu was not to be liable for
any loss or corruption of POL data nor for any failure to perform
the services if it could prove that such loss or corruption or failure
to perform the services was caused by POL data which was lost
or corrupted before Fujitsu received it, and that Fujitsu had

complied with the validation rules.

ii. Clause 33.1.3: In the event POL data was altered, corrupted or
lost in the course of performing the Services, Post Office had the
following options, in addition to any other remedies: (a) Post
Office could require Fujitsu at its own expense to restore or

procure the restoration of the POL data; or (b) Post Office could,

Page 32 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

itself, restore or procure restoration of the POL data, and, in that
instance, should be repaid by Fujitsu any reasonable expenses

so incurred.

d. Clause 43.19 (which, I assess, contains contractual obligations as
defined in paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9 request): Fujitsu was required
to provide to Post Office copies of or access to all relevant records
produced by Fujitsu in the course of performing the HNG-X Services
(records were to include, where produced by Fujitsu, operational change
proposals, help desk records, release notes, change logs, firewall logs,
event records, error logs and audit records) that Post Office assessed
were applicable in respect of such failure or delay.'®

e. Schedule B3.1 - HNG-X Services (which, I assess, contains
contractual obligations as defined in paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9
request): This schedule set out a table (Table A: Operational Services)

which included an obligation for Fujitsu to provide;

i. A Third Line Software Support (service number 9 in Table A)
service for the diagnosis of new software incidents occurring in

Branches;

‘5 Both of these Clauses introduce caveats to Fujitsu’s liability to Post Office for failing or delaying the
performance of their Service obligations:

43.18.1 states there shall be no liability where there is a failure or fault in the communications links to
CAPO or LINK — which were external Banks that Post Office provided banking services to. CAPO
supported Post Office account cards, and LINK provided the network of cash machines.

43.18.2 states there shall be no liability where the failure or delay is due to unauthorised access, hacking
or fraud through the CAPO or LINK systems.

Page 33 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

ii. A Reconciliation Service (number 12 of Table A) for incident
management procedures required to investigate, report and

resolve reconciliation and business incidents;

iii. A data centre and an Application Support Service line (number
14 of Table A) for software and system errors which could not be

resolved by the third line software support service; and

iv. A CMT service (number 15 of Table A) which was to provide a
value add function above the standard incident and problem

management.

Schedule B3.4 - Branch Infrastructure — Paragraph 3.4.4 (which, I
assess, contains contractual obligations as defined in paragraph
2(b) of the Rule 9 request): As an alternative to replacing a type of
equipment that had suffered catastrophic failure, Post Office could
request for Fujitsu to cease to provide or to modify services which were
affected by that catastrophic failure.

Schedule B4.2 - Existing Applications — Paragraph 8 (which, I
assess, contains contractual obligations as defined in paragraph
2(b) of the Rule 9 request): EPOSS, Automated Payment System
(‘APS”) and the Logistics Feed System (“LFS”), but not NBS (which had
a process of recovery of incomplete transactions in the event of a
counter failure) were to have fallback transactions that minimised or
negated the impact of failure in any of the applicable services which used

those Horizon Applications (paragraph 2(b) of the Rule 9 request).

Page 34 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

h. Schedule B4.4 — Existing Service levels (which, I assess, contains
contractual obligations as defined in paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9

request):

" Paragraph 2.2.5(a): In the event that an incident or a major failure
of the Production SAP System caused the Production SAP
System (situated in the live data centre'®) to be unavailable,
Fujitsu was to notify Post Office of such incident or failure as soon
as reasonably practicable. Post Office's advanced distribution
system which is installed in all branches. If the notification was
not in written form, Fujitsu was required to confirm in writing in
accordance with incident management. '”

ii. Paragraph 2.3: All levels of service were to be monitored on a
weekly and monthly basis and any failure to meet a Service Level
assessed over that month was to be reported to Post Office by
means of the Service Review Book produced on a monthly basis
detailing all Service Levels and the actual levels of service
achieved in that month.

iii. Paragraph 4 and 5: The Service Levels that Fujitsu were
required to meet could be adjusted if a volumetric threshold was
exceeded, for example if more than 13,000 calls were made to

the Service Desk in each calendar month. These thresholds were

‘6 The Interpretations section of the Agreement states that data centres are linked to Post Office
infrastructure. Later in contract, it is stated that a Live Data Centre should be linked to support business
capabilities and support facilities — which the Production SAP System was among. There was to be a
corresponding Disaster Recovery Data Centre which ensured business continuity in these

circumstances. The relationship between the two is defined in ‘Data Centre Operations Service: Service
Description’ SVM/SDM/SD/0003.

‘7 The normal practice for incident management was detailed in "Major Incident Process"

(SVM/SDM/PRO/0001).

Page 35 of 255
vi.

WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

detailed in Annex 5 of Schedule B4.4. The remainder of
Paragraph 4 stipulated the ways in which the Service Level was
adjusted based on the extent to which the threshold was
exceeded. Paragraph 5 then clarified that the volumes that would
exceed the threshold for specific services — for example EPOSS
or NBS — would be determined by the Contract Controlled
document (“CCD”) ‘Horizon Capacity Management and
Business Volumes' (PA/PER/033).

Paragraph 7.1: In the event that an ARL specified in Schedule
B4.4 failed, Fujitsu and Post Office were to agree a method of
rectification and timetable for the resolution of the cause of that
failure (a “Rectification Plan”).

Annex 2 - Data Delivery Service Levels — Paragraph 1.3: This
paragraph and the subparagraphs that follow dealt with when
Fujitsu was obliged to arrange and undertake a visit to a branch
to recover transaction records and assessing whether there has
been a failure of service levels. In summary, where Fujitsu had
been unable to arrange a visit to a branch for reasons of delay
on part of the branch, then the period of delay was to be
disregarded and would not be held against Fujitsu pursuant to
the terms of the Contract.

Annex 3- Banking Services: This Annex identified the way that
banking facility performance was to be measured, the
corresponding SLTs and ARLs and the calculations of the

amounts payable if Fujitsu failed to meet the obligation. Part A

Page 36 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

related to NBS. Fujitsu was to record and calculate the number
of Core NB System Faults which caused the NBS not to be
available in any one or more Branches. They were also required
to provide a weekly MIS Bank Analysis Report. Part B addressed
debit card SLTs and ARLs. It stated that Fujitsu was obliged to
provide Payment Files in accordance with the CCD ‘Debit Card
MoP Functional Description’ (EF/SER/001). Part B also
described the method of calculating any damages that arose
from a failure to meet this obligation.

vii. Annex 4 — Miscellaneous Services: This Annex detailed the
Service Levels and associated damages thresholds for services
which did not fall into the Annex 2 or Annex 3 categories. These
included TESQA"® and POL FS'°. The obligations that related to
the specific features of each service were detailed. The required
availability of each service, the timeframes within which queries
should be responded to and the location and time that data

generated by the services should all be uploaded.

18 This is defined in the Interpretations Schedule as ‘the software too! made available by Fujitsu
Services to Post Office which enables TESQA Users to access the Transaction Enquiry Servicé, which
“provides Users with 180 days of (read-only) historical Transaction details, and includes the production
of the Reconciliation and Settlement Reports and despatch of REC Files to CAPO and Alliance &
Leicester."
19 The services provided by Fujitsu, which are detailed in:

Schedule B3.1;

"Service description for the SAP Hosting Service" (CS/SER/022);

Annex C to the CCD entitled "Data Centre Operations Service: Service Description"

(SVM/SDM/SD/0003).

Page 37 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Schedule B6.3 — Acceptance (which, I assess, contains contractual
obligations as defined in paragraph 2(a) of the Rule 9 request (see

paragraph 104(b) for the section on acceptance):

i Paragraph 2.4.2: A Requirement for each aspect of the new
HNG-X system was for it to be allocated its own HNG-X
Acceptance Method. The objectives in allocating HNG-X
Acceptance Method(s) (as defined in Annex C to the Schedule —
see below) to HNG-X Requirements were to progress toward
overall HNG-X Final Acceptance as efficiently as possible - but
to simultaneously identify and resolve defects in the HNG-X
Acceptance Process as early as possible in order to reduce
overall development costs and risks.

ii. Paragraph 2.7 — 2.10: These paragraphs dealt with acceptance
incidents (where acceptance criterion has not been met) and how
fault reports were to be grouped for management and reporting
purposes.

iii. Paragraphs 4.5 — 4.6: These paragraphs and sub-paragraphs
outlined how progression of acceptance should occur once
various conditions had been satisfied, such as there being no
outstanding high severity acceptance incidents, or the number of
medium severity incidents being five or fewer and an agreed
workaround existed. There was also a workaround in the same
way for low severity incidents.

iv. Paragraphs 6.1 — 6.4: These paragraphs and sub-paragraphs

set out how incidents were to be managed, analysed and

Page 38 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

rectified. Fujitsu was to report incidents to Post Office who would
then jointly analyse and classify severity. Tests might then be
repeated and Fujitsu would then prepare a rectification plan.

v. Annex A This annex is an HNG-X Acceptance Incident Severity
Matrix which categorised each incident as 'High, Medium, Low,
Non-Incident.

vi. Annex C: This annex set out the HNG-X Acceptance Methods.
It provided a description to each type of method in respect to
acceptance criteria, for example solution tests that were owned
and managed by Fujitsu with collaboration from Post Office for
the purpose of verifying that Fujitsu's solution for the HNG-X
System satisfied the relevant acceptance criteria.

vii. It is important to note that Post Office’s remedies were
diminished in the HNG-X Acceptance process in comparison with
the CSR Acceptance process in the 1999 Agreement and the
Network Banking Acceptance process in the 2002 Agreement.
There is no clause that gave Post Office a right to terminate the
Agreement in respect of an Acceptance Failure that meant that
Fujitsu did not meet the Acceptance date — although clauses
were in place that prescribed how many Acceptance Incidents
would represent a failure to pass through the given Acceptance
gateway. Further, Clause 2.9 Clarified that an HNG-X
Acceptance Dispute was not a Dispute in the wider context of the

Agreement.

3(b) What, if any, internal or external measures were put in place to monitor

Fujitsu's compliance with the relevant contractual obligations

Introduction

32. The period that is the subject of question 3 of the Rule 9 request is 1 January
2000 to 16 December 2019 (“the relevant period”). As I have explained above
in paragraphs 11-12, I began my role as IT Director for Horizon within Post
Office in September 2020. I therefore do not have any direct personal
knowledge or experience of the matters that are the subject of question 3(b)-
(d). There is also limited corporate knowledge and associated documentary
material within Post Office of the matters that are the subject of those questions.

33. As a result, the approach that I have taken to preparing the response to

questions 3(b)-(d) has been as follows:

a. Post Office's external lawyers, BSFF, have conducted a review of more
than 330,000 documents that are responsive to search terms that have
been created in response to the Rule 9 request in an effort to identify
documents that may assist me in responding to questions 3(b)-(d).

b. Following that review, BSFF have, in conjunction with external counsel,
analysed those documents and prepared a draft statement.

Cc. That draft statement and the underlying documents have been provided
to me to consider with any associated knowledge gaps being highlighted
for Post Office to consider further internally.

d. I have reviewed the statement and made further enquiries within the Post

Office business as needed to satisfy myself to the best of my ability as

Page 40 of 255

WITN03680200

to what the position was within Post Office within the relevant period in
relation to the matters that are the subject of questions 3(b)-(d).

e. Where I have satisfied myself as to what the position was, I have set that
out in this statement. Where I had further questions, I have asked those,
and further investigations have been undertaken internally and
externally to answer them. However, where, despite the work detailed
above, I have not been able to achieve clarity in relation to matters that
are the subject of questions 3(b)-(d), I have made that clear in the
statement, so that the Inquiry is aware of the limits of my (and the wider

Post Office corporate) knowledge and understanding of those matters.

Summary

34.

35.

The ways in which Fujitsu’s compliance was monitored by Post Office varied
and evolved over time in line with system change, the nature of the services
being provided, and the changing nature of Post Office as an organisation.
From the outset of the Horizon system, it is therefore my understanding that
monitoring did not take place in isolation, but as part of an iterative operational
and contractual relationship.

It is my understanding that the monitoring of Fujitsu’s compliance with the
relevant contractual obligations during the relevant period as defined in the Rule
9 request fell within distinct phases of time. I have therefore described the
measures that were put in place to monitor the relevant contractual obligations
as defined in section 2(a) and(b) of the Rule 9 request for each of those time

periods.

Page 41 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

36. I have dealt with the measures that were put in place (whether internally or
externally) to monitor the use of access rights and privileges by Fujitsu
employees to remedy errors in transaction data and branch accounts (section
2(c)) as a distinct section, as these do not sit as clearly within the date ranges
described above because of the complexities associated with Post Office’s

understanding of those contractual obligations.

INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL MEASURES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE TO
MONITOR FUJITSU’S COMPLIANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS AS DEFINED IN SECTIONS 2(A) AND (B) OF THE RULE 9
REQUEST

1999 — 2006

(a) The identification, investigation, recording and reporting of (i) bugs errors
and defects within the Horizon IT system; (ii) other network and system failures

or (iii) the impact of such events on branch accounts.

37. In describing the internal or external measures that were put in place to monitor
Fujitsu’s compliance with the relevant contractual obligations below, the Inquiry
will note that I have not referred specifically to the measures that were used to
identify, investigate, record and report on the impact of events on branch
accounts. The reason for this is because the measures that were used by Post
Office to identify, investigate, record and report on bugs, errors and defects
(“BEDs”) and network and system failures (“NSFs”) would extend to the
impact of those events on branch accounts. There were not separate policies
or procedures in place in respect of the monitoring of the impact of events on

branch accounts.

WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

38. It is my understanding that the internal measures that were put in place to
monitor Fujitsu’s compliance with the matters defined in question 3(b) of the
Rule 9 request (in so far as sections 2(a) and (b) of the Rule 9 request are
concerned) can be summarised in so far as the 1999-2006 period is concerned

as follows:

a. Governance and Contract Management (paragraphs 39-58)

b. Service Reviews (paragraphs 59-102)

Cc. Testing and Acceptance Requirements (paragraphs 103-115)

d. Rolling reporting obligations that were placed on Fujitsu.
Governance and Contract Management

39. The relevant contractual provisions dealing with governance and contract
management during this period were contained within Schedule A047° to the
Original Codified Agreement, which provided for ‘Contract Management’ and
Schedule 4 of the 2002 Agreement, which provided for ‘Governance’.

40. Pursuant to the Original Codified Agreement Schedule, Post Office and Fujitsu

were required to establish the following boards/groups to facilitate that process:

a. Change Control Board

b. Contract Administration Board

(os Service Review Board (see paragraph 59 for Service Review section)
d. Contract Steering Group

e. New Business Board

2° POL00399922

Page 43 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

f. Release Authorisation Board?!

41. It is my understanding that both the Contract Administration Board and the
‘Service Review Board’”*, which were jointly attended by Post Office and
Fujitsu, played a role in Post Office’s monitoring of Fujitsu’s compliance with
the relevant contractual obligations.” I understand that the purpose of the
Contract Administration Board was to review and agree changes to the
contract, provide advice regarding Change Control Notices ("CCNs”) the
drafting of and consideration of Change Requests (”"CRs”). The purpose of the
Service Review Board was to review performance against contracted service
levels and to agree remedies payable arising from any failures to meet service
levels - which I will address in more detail in the Service Review section will set
out in further detail below (see paragraph 59).

42. By January 2000, Keith Baines, who in 1999 held the role of ‘Head of
Commercial’ for Post Office Counters Limited (“POCL”), drafted a discussion
paper that reviewed the structure of joint POCL and Fujitsu meetings, noting
that there had been “some apparent weaknesses in previous arrangements”.
By way of example, one of the weaknesses that was identified was that there

had been “many instances of issues being raised at more than one meeting,

21 POL00399922

22 Attendees at the Service Review Board were to be the POCL Head of Service Management and
others at their description, and Contractor attendees were to be the Customer Service director, and
others at their discretion.

23 The stated purpose of the Service Review Board was“to review performance against contracted
service levels/to agree remedies payable arising from any failures to meet service levels/to monitor
and review operations business change processes” The stated purpose of the Contract

Administration Board was “to review and agree changes to the contract to implement signed CCNs/To
discuss and resolve questions of the interpretation of the contract/To agree mechanisms to enable
new provisions to be drafted and agreed under CCN/To provide expert advice on draftingof CCNs/
Contract version control/Maintaining lists of current CCDs and CRDs/Maintaining lists of agreement to
agree their status.” It was also separately stated that one of the purposes of the Contract
Administration Board was “to discuss and resolve questions of interpretation of the contract.

Page 44 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

and lack of clarity in the process for escalation and resolution of difficult issues”.
It is my understanding that this was noted as being the result of overlapping
terms of reference.”4

43. In his review, Mr Baines proposed that the following committee structure of joint
Post Office and Fujitsu Boards, meetings and working groups was set up to
improve the ongoing arrangements between POCL and Fujitsu pursuant to the

Original Codified Agreement:

a. Joint Management Board

b. New Requirements Board

e. Joint Change Control Board

d. Joint Contract Admin and Commercial Board
e. Joint National Rollout Board

f. Joint CSR+ Programme Board

g. Joint Programme Boards for future Releases
h. Service Review Board (headed by the Head of Business Service
Management)

i. RollOut Working Group
j- Functional Meetings

k. Operational Service Working Groups”®

44. Annex A of the discussion paper appears to have proposed a replacement for
the scheme at Schedule A04 of the Original Codified Agreement.”° It is my

understanding that his proposals were then put to Fujitsu Finance and

24 POL00393888
2° POL00393888, p.4
2° POL00393888, p.4-8

Commercial Director, Tony Oppenheim for consideration?’ and that, thereafter,
some of the proposals were adopted (through, by way of example, some of the
work of the National Roll Out Board), and that in other respects the
arrangements set out in the 1999 Codified Agreement were maintained without
amendment.

45. In carrying out a review of documents for the purposes of preparing this
statement, I have had sight of correspondence which suggests that the primary
responsibility within POCL for the operation of the contract with Fujitsu appears
to have sat, up until 2006, with Keith Baines. It is my understanding that any
perceived non-compliance with the relevant contractual obligations (for
example, data loss by Fujitsu) would be raised on Post Office’s behalf in
ongoing correspondence between Mr Baines and his Fujitsu counterparts and
at meetings of the Contract Administration Board. 7°°

46. It is my understanding that any remedies or changes to the service resulting
from correspondence between Post Office and Fujitsu or discussions at
Contract Administration Board meetings would be expressed and formalised

through correspondence. °°

27 POL00393890

28 See, e.g., POL00401664, letter dated 27 June 2001; POL00401663, letter dated 10 August 2001.

29 I have reviewed correspondence that refers to concerns having been raised by Keith Baines at a
Contract Administration Board meeting regarding an apparent data loss by Fujitsu for a period of 7 days
in August 2000. Reference was made to this having been discussed at a meeting of respective audit
and security teams on 20 June 2001. During the course of the meeting, Post Officeexpressed concern
as to how long “an issue of this magnitude’ was taking to resolve and stated that Fujitsu should have in
place a process which alerts Post Office to any failure of their obligation to maintain a full audit trail,
irrespective of whether Post Office has requested data during the course of a particular period or not.
30 For example, in an exchange between Keith Baines and Colin Lenton-Smith in September 2001,
Fujitsu denied it was in breach of a term of the Original Codified Agreement (concerning the roll out of
pilots), but agreed to suspend its new keys pilot, saying itwould not recommence this unless it received
aCCN. (POL00401662; POL00401661). This appears to have led to discussions about whether timings
for calculating compliance should expressed afresh though a CCN after each ‘major release’
(POL00401660) and later a discussion about whether or not this particular CCNshould incur a new
charge to POCL (POL00401659). Later correspondence in the Spring of 2003 illustrates negotiation

Page 46 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

47. The purpose of the ‘Change Control Board’ (which I understand was also
sometimes referred to as the ‘Business Change Control Board) was “...fo
agree timescales for processing Change Requests (“CRs”) and CCNs”*", to
monitor and review reasons for the rejection of CRs and CCNs and to resolve
questions as to whether particular changes would require an amendment to the
contract via a CR or CNN, (a change amendment to the Codified
Agreement).3255

48. It is also my understanding that a range of other boards and forums also appear
to have been established in 2000 that were not directly referenced or provided
for in the Codified Agreement, but which still appeared to have had a monitoring
function in so far as compliance with the provisions of that Agreement were
concerned.

49. During the period between 1999 and 2006, it is my understanding that

responsibility for monitoring and operational matters relating to the service

review* of the Horizon system lay with the ‘Business Service Management’
department (”BSM”), which sat within the Post Office Network unit (“PON”).°°

BSM* was responsible for, among other things, incident management, problem

between Mr Baines and Mr Lenton-Smith about whether particular CCNs should attract charges or not
(POL00401658; POL00401657; POL00401656; POL00401655). I have viewed these pieces of

correspondence in isolation, and so cannot provide any further information regarding the context of that
correspondence or what occurred thereafter.

31 Schedule AO5 of the Original Codified Agreement, Schedule 5 of the 2002 Agreement and Schedule
A3 of the Current Contract state that this is the document that formally alters the provisions of the
Codified Agreement after a Change Request had been considered and agreed by both Post Office and
Fujitsu.

32 POL00399922

33 As defined in the table detailing the purposes, scheduling and attendees of various boards in the
Annex of Schedule A04 to the Codified Agreement.

* A service review would take place to consider the service levels provided for within the Codified
Agreement, progress against those levels by Fujitsu and agree a proposal as to how to monitor and
manage those levels going forwards.

management, service review and performance.*” I have had sight of examples
of Operational Level Agreements and an associated Strategy Statement that
make it clear that the review of reference data*®*® fell to BSM.

50. It appears from an SLA*° dated 23 April 20014’ that, following a
commencement of an internal trial within the Post Office, the responsibilities of

BSM were defined further to include:

a. managing the interface with Fujitsu, in respect of ensuring that SLAs‘
are reported on;

b. providing instructions that relate to Horizon for new and amended
transactions, and monitoring and reporting on the impact of the
introduction of such transactions;

c. carrying out Incident and Problem Management in respect of Incidents
and Problems that that arise in the operation of counter transactions;

d. Managing the review of services across the automated network including

the management of Fujitsu in relation to the provision of the Horizon

37 POL00394060, dated 2002.

38 Reference data enables applications to be customised using data driven changes as opposed to code
changes, thereby providing a mechanism for implementing operational business changes more quickly
and reliably.

38 SGO reference data changes are a change/update to parameters that drive various elements of the
Horizon platform (such as pricing data etc). Fujitsu receives these changes from Post Office and applies
them to the live system.

40 SLAs were agreements that set out the standards of service Fujitsu were required to meet in relation
to different aspects of the services to be provided pursuant to the main agreement.

41 POL00393987, ‘Service Level Agreement between Internal Account Management and Business
Service Management’ A further version of this document (dated 29 June 2001 v.1.0)extended the trial
to September 2002.41 These trials were underpinned in March 2002 by a set of formal (but internal)
Service Level Agreements and Requirements Catalogues for the Business Service Management unit
and extended to new products in the Business Services Management & Network Banking Integration
programme of work to catalogue the new requirements placed on the Business Service Management
unit.

42 Service Level Agreement Schedule A01 of the Original Codified Agreement, Schedule 1 of the 2001

Agreement and Schedule 1 of the Current Contract state that this is the quantifiable, measurable
standard required by Post Office for a given service as agreed by Post Office and Fujitsu.

Page 48 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

services as defined within Schedules E1 to E9 of the Codified
Agreement, “this will include the analysis of performance data and the
sourcing/provision of appropriate PON business information”,

e. Managing and supporting “a hierarchy of Service and Operational
Review forums, covering the full range of the Horizon Service, as well
as, subject to business approval, other services and processes within
the end to end process of which Horizon forms a part;”

f. Providing “standard reports and, on request, ad hoc reports, detailing the
performance of the Horizon Service;”

g. Producing and maintaining “the client impact scoring matrices on behalf
of Internal Account Management Team (“IAMT’) in relation to all
POCLICL Pathway Service Level Agreements and any others that may
subsequently be added to the Business Impact Model at a future stage ;”

h. Managing "a process focused on Horizon Outlets, whereby proposals for
improvements to any aspect of the Horizon Service can be raised, and

will be assessed, and where appropriate developed and implemented.”

51. It is therefore my understanding, following my review of that SLA, that the
function of BSM was to discharge the overall Service Management
Framework. The first Service Description of this Service was issued on 31
December 20024°, which coincided with the introduction of the 2002
Agreement. However, I have noted that the phrase was used but was not

defined in the Original Codified Agreement. It is my understanding that this

43 POL00394118

Page 49 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Service integrated several other services at meetings of the Service

Management Forum.

52. The Service Management Framework defined “the strategy, policy and
principles that govern the development of Service Management process
models and enable co-operative Service Management by POCL and ICL

Pathway” and was made up of the following disciplines:

a. Incident Management;

b. Problem Management;

(om Change Management;

d. Service Configuration Management;

e. Business Continuity Management;

f. Service Review; and

g. Performance Reporting and Management Information**

53. It was stated within the Service Management Service: Service Description
Contractually Controlled Document (“CCD”) that the purpose of the service was
essentially to monitor manage and maintain the delivery of Operational
Services.** It is my understanding that the Service Review part of this service
(which I will describe further below) that had responsibility for identifying and
reporting of BEDs, whereas the actual rectification and fixing of any identified
BEDs would be carried out as part of the wider Service Management
Framework described above, as part of the incident and problem management

process.

45 POLO0400131

WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

54. The Service Review Framework which was one aspect of the Service
Management Framework that I have referred to above established the
“definitions and policies that have been agreed for the provision of reviews of
the Horizon services by Post Office Counters and ICL Pathway.” The
arrangements were, as I understand it, underpinned by a series of Framework
documents which were settled between Fujitsu and Post Office. Essentially, as
I understand it, the purpose of the Service Review Framework was to monitor
Fujitsu’s compliance with requirements to fix identified problems within
specified timeframes. These were periodically reviewed and updated. As a
result, multiple versions of each document exist.*®

55. By November 2000, BSM had established formal sub-forums to facilitate
ongoing monitoring of Horizon and for there to be an iterative process of

improvement of Horizon in order to meet its responsibilities as defined above.

56. A document entitled “Service Management / High Level Process Description /
Service Improvement”’ dated 14 November 2000%*° illustrated the structure of

the forums in place,*° which shows that there were:

a. “PON Internal Meetings to address business issues:
b. Horizon Programme Board; Horizon Evaluation Review Forum;
c. OBC* (Network) Forum;

d. OBC (Product) Forum”

4° POL00398160

47 This document was drafted by Paul Martin (Process Design Manager) and was authorised by Harvey
Skipsey (Head of Business Service Management).

48 POL00393957

48 POL00393957, p.28

50 All other documents that I have reviewed that refer to this Forum suggest that the meetings were joint
with Fujitsu.

51 OBC was an acronym for "Operational Business Change”.

Page 51 of 255
WITNO3680200

e. “ICL Pathway / PON cross-domain® meetings to address Horizon

cross domain issues:

f. Horizon Commercial Forum;
g. Horizon Service Review Forum;
h. Reference Data Forum;

i. Transaction Data Forum

j. IRERF Forum [Incident Reconciliation Exceptions Review Form]
k. Problem Management Forum

I. AP forum [Automated Payments Forum]

m. LFS Forum [Logistics Feed System]”

n. “ICL Pathway Internal Meetings
oO. ICL Pathway internal review forum
p. Internal Operations Meetings”

57. However, whilst reference was made in that document to the meetings of the
Horizon Evaluation Review Forum being internal within Post Office, the other
documentation that I have reviewed for the purposes of preparing this
statement refers to the fact that the meetings were joint with Fujitsu.°° The focus
of these meetings was referred to as being “similar to that of the Horizon Service
Review Forum to assess the impact of NRO [national rollout] on the business” °4
In 2001, it is my understanding that the Forum’s focus changed as the rollout

of Horizon to outlets neared completion. As a result, it is my understanding that

the Forum was concluded and replaced by the Automated Services Forum.*>

82 I understand cross-domain to mean in this context, cross IT system meetings between Post Office
and Fujitsu.

58. The Horizon Service Review Forum’s meetings (between POCL, Fujitsu and
the Department of Social Security) were held to review the overall performance
of Fujitsu’s systems and services. It is my understanding that the forum
reviewed all services provided by Fujitsu under the general umbrella of the
Horizon system. Meetings are recorded as having included discussion of a
variety of Fujitsu’s contracted services, including the review of “major incidents
and/or significant outstanding problem,” “quantitative and qualitative
assessment of services” and “developing and monitoring of service

improvement initiatives”. ©

Service Review
The approach to Service Review

59. It is my understanding that “Service Review’ was the central internal measure
that Post Office used on an ongoing basis to monitor all of the contractual
obligations that Fujitsu had pursuant to the Codified Agreement. This included
the obligations that related to sections 2(a) and 2(b) of the Rule 9 request.

60. In the Codified Agreement, the services that Fujitsu supplied (“the Services”)
were divided into categories.*’ These Services were then broken down — and

each of the sub-categories had its own SLT (the ‘Service Level Sub-

5° POL00393875

57 In the Original Codified Agreement, the Services that Fujitsu provided were broken down into: the
automated payment service (Schedule E1— EQ), Electronic Point of Sale Services (Schedules F1—

FQ), POL Infrastructure Services (Schedule G1— G11), OBCS (Schedules H1 — H9) and the Logistics

Feeder Service (K1— K9)

In the 2002 Agreement, the Schedules that Fujitsu provided were broken down into: the Operational
Services (Schedule 19), the Development Services (Schedule 20), the Business Continuity Services
(Schedule 1), the Branch Hardware Implementation Services (Schedule 23), and the Banking

Implementation Activities (Schedule 24)

In the Current Contract, the Schedules that Fujitsu provided were broken down into Development
Services (Schedule B1.1—B1.3), HNG-X Services (Schedule B3.1-— Schedule B3.3), Transfer Services

(Schedule E)

Page 53 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Obligation” ) which was monitored in isolation. Therefore, when an SLT related
to a Service Level Sub-Obligation that, in turn, related to obligations relevant
to sections 2(a) and (b) of the Rule 9 request, the ongoing Service Review of
that SLT represented an important way in which Post Office could monitor
Fujitsu's contractual adherence to the relevant contractual obligations.

61.A Service Level Sub-Obligation that relates to the relevant contractual
obligations can be found within most Services because of how broadly BEDs
could affect those services (for example, a BED may have caused a failure in
relation to the automated payment service). There was not a separate or distinct
category of SLTs for the identification or rectification of BEDs.

62. I will use the SLTs relating to the Horizon System Helpdesk (“HSH”), which
was part of the Infrastructure Service, for the purpose of illustrating how the
SLTs were designed to work in practice. I have chosen this SLT as an example
because the Horizon System Helpdesk was the "the first point of contact for
Customers of the POCL Services" experiencing problems (which would include
errors that might be caused by BEDs) according to Schedule G01 of the
Original Codified Agreement. It is also my understanding that customer
reporting was the way that most BEDs were identified and so the operation of
this SLT directly relates to the relevant contractual obligations as defined in
section 2(a).

63. In the provisions of the Original Codified Agreement that deal with the HSH,
the Service Sub-Obligation to repair a problem (which may or may not have
been caused by a BED) in a given time (“Time to Repair”) was summarised in

the following table:

Page 54 of 255
WITN03680200
WITNO03680200

Tocal Tocal I intermediate I Intersediate I Remote Ronote
Non- Remedial I Non-Remedial I Remedial Yon-
Resedial Rezedial

Class
call

‘B’ ~T hour: 10 hours 10 hours 15 hours 12 hours I 24 hb

64. This table demonstrates that when a problem or incident was reported to the

HSH it was categorised by “Priority” and “Type of Branch” as follows:

a. Priority: ‘A Priority problems were those that impacted on all of the
counters in a Post Office. ‘B Priority problems were those that impacted
on one of the counters. In reality, it was unlikely that a problem would
impact only on a small number of counters when they were running the
same version of Horizon. It is my understanding that the division
between Priority A and B problems is likely to happen where localised
outages impact on counters in a particular geographical area.

b. Type of Branch: a branch was considered to be Local, Intermediate or
Remote based on its geographical location. Which category it fell into
was determined by postcode in the CCD ‘Definition of Remote and
Intermediate Locations.’*® CCDs are defined in the main agreement®? as
either documents referred to as CCDs in the main agreement, listed as
CCDs in a document titled “Contract Controlled and Referenced
Document List° or which can only be amended through the Change

Control Procedure.

59 2002 Agreement, v1.0
59 POL00393915

Page 55 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

65. The SLT for Time to Repair differed depending on what categorisation it was

given.

66. The table also differentiates between 'non-remedial and 'remedial' timescales.
The non-remedial column represents the SLT. For example, taking a category
B problem in a local branch- if the time to repair exceeded 8 hours, this was
deemed to be a failure of the SLT — which meant that Fujitsu had failed to meet
their associated contractual obligation. The columns that contain the phrase
“remedial” highlight the threshold at which point a remedy would become
available —which I will discuss and explain further in my response to question
3(d) below (see paragraph 369 onwards). In other words, if after the expiry of 8
hours from when the problem was reported, there was a failure to meet an SLT,
a remedy then became available after 12 hours.

67. Due to the sheer volume and complexity of SLTs within the period that is the
subject of the Rule 9 request, I have been unable to identify every SLT that may
relate to a relevant contractual obligation. However, I am able to confirm that
after the 2002 Agreement, the SLTs for all of the Service Level Sub-Obligations
were summarised in the CCD entitled “Service Level Targets for Horizon
Services”, which extracts the Service Levels from the Codified Agreement and

explains them.®"
Service Review Structure

68. Post Office implemented a Service Review Structure to monitor the degree to
which the SLTs for Service Sub-Obligations were being adhered to. It was in

place between 1999 and 2006 in various stages of completeness. In April of

®1 POL00400777

Page 56 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

2000, an Internal Audit of the HSH found that documents relating to the Service

Review Framework were incomplete and recommended that their "content be

finalised, agreed, approved and deployed without delay”.* It appears that it was

finalised at some point thereafter between 2000 and 2002. However, I have not

seen any finalised versions from this period. It is my understanding that it*was

subsequently further® updated.

69. The most definitive version of a document which describes the Framework is a

Service Review Framework Final Draft from March 2002°° which appears to

have been prepared while the revision process was ongoing. This document

stated that the Framework had three levels:

a. The Senior Management Level (Section 1)
b. Operational Level (Section 2)
c. Business Unit Level (Section 3)

70. They were structured as is shown in the diagram below:

The Senior Management Level

71. The Board with the overarching responsibility for Service Review was detailed
in the 'Governance' Schedules of the Codified Agreement.

72. In Schedule A04 of the Original Codified Agreement this Board was known as
the ‘Service Review Board’ or the ‘Horizon Service Review Board’. Its

responsibilities were:

a. To review Fujitsu's performance against contracted service levels

b. To agree remedies payable arising from any failures to meet service
levels (this process is explored further in the response to question 3(d)
of the Rule 9 request below at paragraph 364. )

c To monitor and review operations of operational business change

processes.

73.In Schedule 4 of the 2002 Agreement, the Board became the Service
Management Forum® or the ‘Horizon Service Management Forum' and was
also known as the ‘Horizon Services Review Forum’. The responsibilities of this
Board appear to have been similar to, but arguably wider than, those of the
1999 Service Review Board. The responsibilities that would appear, based on
my understanding to have related to the relevant contractual obligations in

relation to sections 2(a) and (b) are:

a. Reviewing performance against contracted service levels and agreeing

remedies payable (if any).

% This is implied by the progressive drafts of the 'Service Management Service: Service Description’, in
which Section 3.3 transitioned from ‘Structure of Service Review Board! into ‘Structure of Service
Management Forum' between Version 0.1 issued on 1 December 2002 and Version 1 issued on 31
December 2002 (in alignment with the new version of the Codified Agreement.

Page 59 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

b. Reviewing the operational reliability of Branch Infrastructure and
considering/recommending remedial courses of action (e.g. full or partial
technological refresh or service level relief).

[oe Resolving operational issues including, but not limited to, those arising
from non-conformance to contracted service levels

d. Ensuring continuous improvement in the ongoing/steady state/business

as usual Service Management environment.

e. Reviewing future change plans to ensure the live environment was
adequately prepared.

f. Capacity management.

g. Monitoring and reviewing operations of Operational Business Change
processes.

74. In Schedule A2 of the Current Contract, the Service Management Relationship
was the body with responsibilities for Service Review. However, I have been
unable to identify which precise Boards were set up by this Relationship (see
paragraphs 141-143).

75. During the 2000 — 2006 period, it is my understanding that the Service Review
Board and the Service Management Forum (together 'The Horizon Forums’)
were the "top level formal review between POCL and ICL Pathway" and had
the express purpose of "reviewing performance against contracted service
levels and agreeing remedies payable (if any)".©° They appear to have been the
key forums monitoring Fujitsu's compliance with the relevant contractual

obligations because they monitored Fujitsu’ adherence to all contractual terms.

§7 POL00393913
88 2002 Agreement, Schedule 4, Annex 1

Page 60 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

76. The Horizon Forums appear to have been attended by members of both Post
Office and Fujitsu, but the frequency of their meetings is unclear. Schedule A04
of the Codified Agreement provides for some of the attendees at these
meetings, specifically the Head of Service Management and Meeting Secretary
and others at POL’s discretion. However, version 5.0 provided for additional
attendees including the Service Operations Manager and the Head of Business
Service Management.

77. Contractually, the Original Codified Agreement stated that the function of the
Service Review Board was to meet monthly in Schedule A04; although a
meeting referred to as the Service Review Meeting was to occur quarterly.®? In
Schedule 4 of 2002 Agreement, it was also stated that that the Service Review
Board meetings were monthly.

78. I have had sight of a meeting schedule for a Service Review Board meeting
from 1999 which confirms that the meetings were monthly in this period.’° This
is reinforced by meeting minutes that I have also seen. In documentation that I
have reviewed from 2002, it appears that the meetings were less frequent and
occurred on a bi-monthly basis.”' However, by 2003, based on the documents

that I have reviewed, they seemed to have met monthly again.
Sources of Information for Service Review at the Senior Management Level

79. The Horizon Review Forums appear, based on the documentation that I have

reviewed for the purposes of preparing this statement, to have received reports

® Original Codified Agreement, Schedule E05, Paragraph 3.2.1
7 POL00394091
7 POL00394015

Page 61 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

in relation to the services provided by Fujitsu pursuant to the Codified

Agreement from two main sources. These were:

a. Reports provided as part of the Management Information Service — in
particular the Service Review Book (examples of which I have referred
to below between paragraphs 81-84).

b. Operational Forum Reporting (see paragraph 94 for Operational Level

section).

Management Information Service Reports and the Service Review Book

80. Throughout the contractual term, Fujitsu were contractually obliged to report to
Post Office on the degree to which they were meeting the contractually
stipulated SLTs.

81. The central means of doing so appears to have been through the Service
Review Book (also known as the Service Management Report), which Fujitsu
was contractually required to provide on a monthly basis under Schedule AO6
Paragraph 4.2 of the Original Codified Agreement, Schedule 15 Paragraph 2.4
of the 2002 Agreement, and Schedule B4.4, Paragraph 2.3 of the Current
Contract.

82.A document entitled 'The Management Information Service: Service
Description” (which I will summarise as “The MIS: SD” for ease of reference),
defined the contents of the Service Review Book and explained its purpose. It
stated it was the "primary input into the Service Management Forum on
performance against SLTs". It also detailed the other monthly reports that

Fujitsu was obliged to provide.

Page 62 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

83. It is my understanding that 8 versions of this document were produced during
the course of the relevant period and that the content of the Service Review
Book differed across those versions.

84. The Service Review Book does not appear to have materially changed
between the Codified Agreement coming into force and 18 November 2004.
Although version 1 of the MIS:SD was issued on 20 December 2002 (over three
years following the Codified Agreement), it referred to content that had been in
place since 1999. The document, during this period, was structured, in

summary, as follows:

a. SLT data — which was the comparison of Fujitsu's performance against
the SLTs.”
b. Management summaries detailing the highlights of the last month's

service delivery.

c. A high- level review of each of the supplied services.

d. Volumetric data.

e. A high-level review of problem management and cross domain problem
status.

f. A high-level review of release management including releases delivered.

g. Annexes identifying Engineer Service Failures attracting remedies

(including liquidated damages), with the following details relating to each
failure: “Incident reference”, “Degree of failure”; “Brief explanation of the
incident”; “Explanation of the cause of failure”; “Action planned to
72 POL00394102. The SLTs were broken down according to the following services in this period:

Helpdesk Service, System Service, Data Service, Transaction Service, Training services,
implementation and rollout and LF Service.

WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

mitigate further failures.” However, I have been unable to locate any
such annexes in the Service Review Books and packs that I have

reviewed for the purposes of preparing this statement.

85. It is my understanding that the key section of this document, in relation to
Service Review, was SLT Data ('A’ above) — which evidenced the degree to
which Fujitsu reported to Post Office that they had met their SLTs. I understand
that Fujitsu would classify its adherence to the relevant ‘Service Level Sub-

Obligation’ using the following colour coding:

a. Green: indicated performance on the part of Fujitsu that was above the

level required.

b. “>o. indicated a one-off failure with either an action plan in place or

not required.

c. Red: indicated a repeated failure.

86. An example of this colour coding system in practice can be found in the 2001
Service Review Book in which the HSH SLTs for Time to Repair (see paragraph

63) were tracked as follows:

87. The central column in white — with the heading ‘Call to Resolution’ (Remote)’
mirrors the SLTs for ‘Time to Repair (Remote)’ detailed in the Codified
Agreement — which are detailed in the table above: specifically: 8 Hours to
resolve Priority A calls and 12 hours to resolve Priority B calls. As stated above,
the ‘Remedial’ timescales will be discussed in my response to question 3(d)
below (see paragraph 372 onwards below).

88. The column entitled ‘MAT’ (Minimum Acceptable Threshold) shows the
percentage of cases that Fujitsu needed to meet the SLT in — so, Fujitsu needed
to repair a Priority A fault at a remote branch within 8 hours 95% of the time.

89. The left-hand side of the table, containing the colour coded squares, shows the
percentage of the time that Fujitsu met the SLT in the given month. For
example, September 2001 is coloured green because it was above the 95%
level. However, July 2001 is coloured yellow because Fujitsu only met the
expected level for the time taken to repair an issue in 60% of cases. I have not
been able to establish what, if any, tools were available to Post Office to monitor
if Fujitsu was accurately reporting its performance in the Service Review Books.

90. I will discuss the columns on the right hand of this table (entitled MAT and TRT)
further in the liquidated damages section (see paragraph 372 onwards).

9

. As subsequent versions of The MIS:SD were developed, Fujitsu's reporting
requirements also changed. This had an impact on the extent to which Post
Office monitored certain contractual obligations. I have detailed below the
version changes that contained provisions related to the relevant contractual
obligations (and the associated impact on Post Office’s monitoring of those

obligations) below.

Page 66 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

a. It is my understanding that, in Version 3, issued on 8 July 2005, an
important change was introduced in that Fujitsu were obliged to report
all failures against SLTs as well as Engineer Service Failures under 'G'
above. However, despite seeing numerous references to this annex in
documents that I have reviewed for the purposes of preparing this
statement, I have not been able to locate it to date.

b. In Version 4 (for which the official version title was reset to '1' (i.e.
Version 1) as it coincided with the Release of the 2006 Codified
Agreement), issued on 24 August 2006, 'Summary Service Overviews’,
were added to the Service Review Book. These augmented the 'High-
Level Reviews' for each of the Services that were required pursuant to
Version 1 released on 20 December 2002 ('C' Above) by adding further
graphs that drew out key information.”* In addition, a more extensive
narrative summary was added for each of the Services' sections.

c. I have reviewed a document’* which stated that the Service
Management Portal contained the following management information:

Real time Service Monitors:

i. SLT information — provided on a daily, monthly and quarterly

scale

ii. Registers of Customer Service Improvement Proposals

73 The SLT Performance by SLT Group showing the overall number of SLTs falling into the red, amber
or green category. The SLT Performance by SLT group for the reported month when compared against
the 12-month average. This would be labelled either—'Up' if it was higher or 'Down' if it was lower. The

monthly performance of services delivered to branches— as opposed to just those services delivered

to Post Office. The Customer service scorecard compiled of customer feedback— which would also be

compared against the 12-month average and be labelledeither — 'Up' if it was higher or 'Down' if it was

lower.

74 POL00395270

Page 67 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

iii. The Service Review Book

iv. Major Incident Reports

v. Weekly Service Management Report

vi. Operational Business Change Schedules
vii. OCP Information and Schedules

The SLT information described above gave Post Office real-time
access to the service level reporting of any SLT — and, therefore, it is
my understanding that Post Office could check the status of Fujitsu's
performance in relation to any Service Level Target that was relevant to
the relevant contractual obligations within sections 2(a) and 2(b), at any
time. In addition, Major Incident Reports were a key way through which
BEDs were identified and Post Office had access to those on the
Service Management Portal. Customer Service Improvement
Proposals were a means through which Fujitsu could propose an
improvement plan. However, it is my understanding that this was not a

means through which the rectification of BEDs would be taken forward.

Version 6 (the official title for which was Version 3), issued on 2
February 2010, removed the requirement for the following to be included

in the Service Review Book:

i. Volumetric data ('C' above);

ii. A summary review of releases ('E' above);

Page 68 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

iii. Annexes that detailed where liquidated damages were payable
for the month being reported on — or the details associated with
them ('F' above);

iv. The customer service scorecard.

f. From the point at which Version 5 was issued on 5 November 2013, the
Service Review Book only consisted of monthly SLT achievements
compared against the data in relation to the preceding 13 months
displayed in an excel spreadsheet. Management summaries formerly
listed at 'B' were to be provided in separate documents. These changes
remained in place as the CCD was not modified again until 7 January

2022.

92. The consolidated monthly reporting within the Service Review Book was further

provided for as follows:

a. Version 1, Version 2 and Version 3: Network Banking, Automated

Payments, Capacity Management;

b. Version 4 (the official title for which was Version 1) and Version 5 (the
Official title for which was Version 2) and Version 6 (the official title for
which was Version 3): Banking and Related Services, Automated

Payments

Cc. Version 7 (the official title for which was Version 4)

93. It is my understanding that, through an analysis of the sources of Fujitsu
management information that are described above, the Horizon Forums would
review whether Fujitsu had fallen beneath the SLT for a given Service Level

Page 69 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Sub-Obligation (which would include those that related to the relevant
contractual obligations). As a result, it is my understanding that the Horizon
Forums were a key measure which Post Office implemented to track and
evaluate Fujitsu’s compliance with the relevant contractual obligations, based

on the reporting that was provided to it by Fujitsu.

Operational Level —- Operational Level Review Forums

94. Itis my understanding that, Operational Level Forums (which had an oversight
role in relation to many areas of the Post Office business, and were the subject
of extensive restructuring between 1999 and 2006) played an important role in
monitoring and reporting on Fujitsu's adherence to Service Levels by
monitoring and relaying associated information to the Horizon Forums during
this period. It is my understanding though that they were not responsible for the
direct monitoring of compliance by Fujitsu with the relevant contractual
obligations but that their reporting assisted that monitoring by other Forums
which I will detail further below.

95. It is my understanding that Post Office’s Operational Level forums were
restructured extensively throughout the 1999 - 2006 period due to
organisational changes.

96. These forums were governed by Operational Level Agreements, the purpose
of which was to “underpin and support service levels as agreed in SLAs" by
"describing how a service or system will operate at an operational level." These

were non-contractual documents.”°

75 POL00394060

Page 70 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

97.In 2002, the Operational Level Forums included a Problem Management

Forum. It is my understanding that this forum discussed problems (which would

have included BEDs or other service failures that are the subject of the relevant

contractual obligations) and determine whether, as it discussed problems, to

check if they warranted escalation to the Horizon Service Review Forum.

98. It is my understanding that these operational level forums would produce

feedback forms that documented the level of service in the subject area that

each forum focused on and included reference to the issues that needed to be

escalated to the Horizon Forums that sat above them for review. For example,

the Horizon Help Desk had an Operational forum in early 200076 which I

understand was a key way through which Post Office was alerted to

malfunctioning software.

99. By way of example, the Live Environment Forum produced a periodic report

entitled “Horizon Programme / Business Service Management / Management

of the Live Environment’”’, which was referred to as the ‘MoLE Report’ and was

circulated to a designated group of recipients.’8”° I have only been able to

identify one such report. It appears that the purpose of this report was to provide

information in relation to, by way of example:

a. “(i); the management of the live environment and the effects of Horizon

on individual business units which would be an internal Post Office

b. (ii) critical success factors (CSFs) which were intended to highlight the
impacts on areas of key performance as defined by business units; and
c. (iii) performance statistics for the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH and
Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) to provide visibility of

potential problems.”

100. Other sections of the report detailed problems which had been open for 6
months or more and provided a number of specific examples which I have
detailed in the bullet-pointed section at the end of this paragraph. However, as
has been the case with a number of other documents that I have reviewed and
referred to in this statement, I have reviewed this report in isolation. As a result,
lam not able to comment on the context surrounding the examples that are set

out below or what, if any, further actions were taken as a result:

a. “Receipts and payments do not match ON Migration week ... 24/05/1999
- 30/04/2000 PON are continuing to identify a way forward for
progressing these problems and should conclude their strategy by the
end of May. It has become clear that there is nothing within the contract
that can enforce ownership to Fujitsu, therefore any changes will need
to be funded by PON. Given that 95% of the incidents are still attributable
to migration which has approx. 14 months to go, it is envisaged that this
will become a ‘known error’.”®°

80 A known error would be placed on a Known Error Log (KEL) when the root cause of a problem had
not been identified or repaired, but there was a workaround that had been developed. The log was

c. “Contingency for system failure when balancing Jonathan
Rogers28/09/1999- 04/05/2000Workshop to review proposed process -

16/05/00”

101. It is my understanding that another example of an operational level forum
relevant to the relevant contractual obligations that played a role in the
monitoring of the relevant contractual obligations was the Post Office Network
Executive Committee (“PONEC”). In 2000, the Committee received a package
of documents which highlighted failures associated with the Horizon rollout.
One of those documents, by way of example, was, an Update Paper report that
was produced on 17 May 2000. This report which noted failures during the
national rollout in the form of including an inability of frontline employees to
deliver Horizon to the required standards.*' A Performance summary was

generated which described Fujitsu's performance over the previous year was

available for consultation by staff at the SSC who could use the workaround that was described in their
advice to customers who made calls to the helpdesk.

81 POL00393898. Attendees at the PONEC meeting were David Miller, Alan Barrie, Tim Thorpe, Dave
Smith, Peter Turgoose, Eric Logan, John Main and Jon Millidge.

seen as poor on account of their service failures and failure to achieve key
deliverables. ®?

102. I have not been able to identify any further examples of similar meeting notes
(or associated documents) following the examples that I have referred to above,
so I am unable to provide further assistance to the Inquiry in relation to the way

in which the concerns that were raised were ultimately managed thereafter.

Testing and acceptance requirements

103. From the commencement of Post Office’s contractual relationship with Fujitsu
(with 28 July 1999 being the date of the Original Codified Agreement, as I have
detailed above at paragraph 18), it is my understanding that measures were
included into the Agreement that a given project or change to the Horizon
system was monitored through testing, a condition imposed under Version 1,
Schedule G01, Paragraph 5.3.3.3 of the Codified Agreement. 98485

104. It is my understanding that the testing regime was comprised of the following:

a. Joint Testing: A joint testing process had been engrained in Post Office
's contractual relationship with Fujitsu since the preliminary agreements
which, as I have outlined in my response to question 3(a) (see
paragraphs 16-17) preceded the creation of the Codified Agreement in
1999. A ‘Joint Testing Agreement’ dated 30 January 1998 stated that the
aim of joint testing was to enhance the quality of the test and enhance

Fujitsu's fault management.®°

WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

b. Acceptance Requirements: Post Office defined criteria that needed to be
met before products, software or services were released into the live
environment”, which were known as ‘Acceptance Requirements’. These
applied to both new services provided pursuant to the Codified
Agreement®® and existing services that Fujitsu were updating or fixing.

105. The Acceptance Requirements and Acceptance Procedure for new Services
introduced under the Codified Agreement were normally contained in a
Schedule of the Codified Agreement. For example, Schedule A11 of the
Original Codified Agreement described the Acceptance Requirements for CSR
(the core, fundamental Horizon system).

106. These included specifications like secure operation in the case of service
degradations®®, the use of audit trails, the preservation of system integrity, the
use of encryption to prevent unauthorised access to or modification of data and
the acceptable level of system resilience.*° By doing so, Post Office put in place
measures so that issues that were relevant to contractual monitoring which
were taken into account before the system or update went live.°' This appears
to have applied to entire systems, such as the HNG-X Generic Acceptance

9293,

Process”* and to smaller scale updates.

87 The live environment was the Horizon system as used within Post Office branches.

88 POL00397327

89 Secure operation would relate to maintaining the levels of security around the Horizon infrastructure
and applications. Service degradation may occur when, for example, security patches are not applied
in a timely manner.

%3 The HNG-X Generic Acceptance Process provided an agreed process to enable POCL to objectively
confirm (known as a “Release Acceptance”) that Fujitsu had fulfilled its obligations regarding the
delivery of BAU Releases (those initiated by a customer change request, subject to commercial
contractual terms and resulting in software application changes to the Live Post Office Estate). The
process was managed via stage progression through Acceptance Gateways i.e. formal assessments
of the required evidence. It also included mechanisms to rectify issues preventing the fulfilment of unmet

Page 75 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

a. Quality Gates: These were defined criteria that needed to be satisfied
before the next stage of testing occurred. These were defined in the
Codified Agreement™®® as being based on objective entry criteria, drawn
from generic checklists, to support the assessment of readiness,
timeliness, worth and risk.

b. Regression testing: fixes for bugs, errors and problems would also be
tested before they were implemented in the live environment to check
whether they had an impact on existing functionality to make sure that

the system was not adversely affected by the introduction of a change.

107. It was envisaged that before acceptance of the release of the software into
the live environment, Post Office would conduct a final review to ensure that
these various testing stages had been met.°°

108. It is my understanding that the review was the responsibility of the relevant
Release Authorisation Board, of which there were several. It is my
understanding that attendees at the Release Authorisation Boards varied and

may have been determined by the particular release that was the subject of a

Acceptance Criteria. The Generic process did not apply to all types of releases, including maintenance
releases, the PODG Client Connection Service, and the Reference Data Management Service.
Responsibility for managing the process rested with Acceptance Managers, who were either the
Release Managers or specific individuals appointed by Post Office and Fujitsu. They agreed an
Acceptance Plan which identified the timescales for provision of Acceptance evidence, which was
usually determined by the Acceptance Method. The process would then involve Design Walkthrough,
Document Review, Test and then Monitor.

% Current Contract, Schedule D1 (HNGX Design and Build), paragraph 15.2 which provided that’Each
test stage will have associated, documented quality gates (QGs) that will support the readiness review
process to decide whether it is appropriate to enter or leave the stage of testing to which the QGs
relate.”

Board’s meeting on a particular date.°” Whilst I have not seen reference to
something called a specific acceptance process, it is my understanding, based
on the information regarding the process described above, that this was such
a process. The acceptance process essentially amounted to a formal sign-off
following the completion of testing, the review of test exit reporting, a review of
any specific acceptance criteria (which would normally include things like defect
thresholds) and then a final sign-off, which, at the time, would need to have

been done by wet signature.

109. The Acceptance Requirements anticipated a level of system error and rolling
rectification, and to that extent the scheme anticipated that some BEDs should
not prevent system release and instead were to be recorded on a known error
log (‘KEL’). The KEL was used as a way of monitoring BEDs in the period
between identification and determination being made as to whether it could be
fixed. Once a BED had been remedied, it would be removed from the KEL.
Individual BEDs could be escalated for inclusion on the KEL if they were not
capable of being addressed prior to the proposed system release. Until around

2004, those individual BEDs were recorded as ‘PinICLs’.

97 By way of example, at a meeting of the s.52 Release Authorisation Board on 15 March 2004,
attendees included the Customer Service Director, the Operations and Support Service Manager, the
Infrastructure Services Manager, the Service Introduction Manager, the Security Manager, the Project
Manager, the Release Manager, the Business Continuity Manager, the Service Review Manager, the
Contract Manager (Fujitsu Services), the Release Implementation Manager, the Release
Implementation Support Manager and the Project Manager(POL00394339). At a meeting of a
separate Release Acceptance Board in 2017, the attendees were recorded as being Post Office
Project Manager, Post Office Business Analyst, ATOS Business Analyst, ATOS Project Manager,
ATOS Test Manager, ATOS Architect, FJS Programme Management, FJS Development Manager,
FJS Project Management, FJS Chief Architect, FJS Solution Architect, FJS Commercial, FS Release
Management, FJS Acceptance, FJS Operational Change, FJS Service and FJS Test Management
(POL00400280).

110. If the Horizon system was functionally defective as a result of a BED though,
that would be classed as an unacceptable error that could prevent release (see
also paragraphs 413-415 in which I confirm that this remains the position
today).

111. The procedure for the escalation of individual BEDs to the KEL is apparent
from documents associated with the release of software updates S50 and S60
around 2003 and 2004. Testing during mid-2003% identified certain areas that
were being affected by PiniCLs. Based on the documents that have been
identified as relating to the matters that are the subject of this rule 9 request, it
is my understanding that during this period lists of PiniCLs were regularly sent
by Fujitsu to POL on spreadsheets as part of the testing regime in anticipation
of the software updates, with occasional reference to the need to escalate a
particular issue to a KEL.°°

112. The process is illustrated in internal POL emails from September 2003 1°?

where Graeme Seedall of POL IT directorate said:
“Some existing defects have been unearthed as a result of S50 testing - they
will need to be added to the known error log. There will also be some unfixed
defects on the new services (such as Bureau). We should get a fairly definitive
view of the outstanding PinICLs at the end of testing next Friday - there would
normally be a review to go through them”.

113. The same email thread shows that by November 2003 it was identified that:

a) “There is a "Deferred PinICL list" for S50 which explains the outstanding
faults in business terms (we used to call it the Known Problem Register). A

new version has just come out with a few additions from RVT and LRDP,
also an explanation of the planned action.”
b) “There is a design log for each product which contains not just PinICLs and

their workarounds but known design flaws, missing requirements etc.”

114. There was a discussion, within that same email thread, about which team or
organisation should ‘own’ this document and I have not been able to establish
how this was ultimately resolved. However, I have reviewed a subsequent email
thread from February 2004 in which it was implied that ownership of this
document may have sat with Network Support'®', and I have seen emails
exchanged in July 2004 '°? which suggest that the KEL process was maintained

by Network Support and Fujitsu.

115. By 2004, PinlICLs were referred to as PEAKS. I have had sight of an email
from June 2004 in which Fujitsu proposed to POL that a list of “faults raised
during S60 functional testing which may have a business impact” should either
be deferred to a future release, or included in the KEL. '® The list itself is entitled
‘Outstanding Peaks from S60’.'It is my understanding from subsequent
emails that I have seen'®> that POL intended that those incidents would then
be handled by the Problem Management team, which is a process I describe

below at paragraphs 123-129.

(b) The adoption of measures to rectify bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon
system

2000-2002

116. As part of the review of documents that I have carried out for the purposes of
preparing this statement, I have considered reports that were produced for the
‘Problem Management Forum’ (also known as the ‘Problem Management
Operational Review Forum’) which I have referred to above in paragraph 56
as one of the sub-forums to the Business Management Unit, which were set up
from November 2000. This appeared to be the forum, prior to 2002, through
which measures that were required to rectify BEDs, in the Horizon system or
associated access issues or impact on branch accounts were discussed and
agreed between Post Office and Fujitsu. Fujitsu were obliged to establish
procedures like these under Post Office’s Requirement 914 in the Original
Codified Agreement.

117.A problem, for the purposes of this forum, appears to have been defined in
the same way as set out below (see paragraph 123 under subheading ‘Problem
management’). This definition would, as I understand it, capture BEDs and
system errors.

118. The ways through which problems could be escalated to the Forum are

detailed in the associated Terms of Reference '° as being:

a. Problem management database reports
b. Service improvement proposals
c. Issues raised to the forum from the Post Office Network or ICL Pathway

196 POL00393982

d. Minutes and Actions of a previous meeting.

119. By way of example, a meeting on 16 November 2001, attendees received the

following:'°”

a. a meeting agenda; 1°°

b. a ‘3 month old Problem Report’;'

c. a ‘Problem Management Status Report’ ;1"°
d. a ‘problem co-ordinator matrix’ ;!!'and
e. notes from the previous meeting!’

120.1 have reviewed the two status reports. In the report for August 2001,
reference was made to how outlets (which would be Post Office branches) are
“experiencing problems with daily and weekly cash on hand figures not
matching up” and that the Horizon Project “are working on a communication to
outlets”."'>

121. In the October 2001 report, it was stated, in summary, that:

a. the slow running of counter systems had been ongoing for a
considerable length of time; and
b. the current Fujitsu fix was not currently fit for purpose and needed to be

resolved before being released into the Horizon live system. '"*

2002 onwards

122. By 2002, it is my understanding that a formalised process for incident and
problem management had been finalised to fulfil Fujitsu's obligation to remedy
defects in the Horizon system under Clause 6.2 of the 2002 Agreement."*® The
process was detailed in a document entitled “ICL Pathway Problem
Management Procedures”.'‘° The respective incident and problem

management processes, as defined in that document, are summarised below.
Problem management

123. Problem management was required where a problem (which was defined as
“an underlying cause that may result in incidents”) caused an impact substantial
enough to warrant action to eradicate it. This would capture BEDs and system
errors.

124. The purpose of problem management was to identify and resolve the root

cause of issues that would otherwise create incidents.

125. It is my understanding that these types of problems were raised by Post Office
with Fujitsu’s daytime Duty Manager. Duty Manager is a Fujitsu role.
126. The Duty Manager would then contact the person who had raised the problem

(referred to as "the originator"). This could, for example, be a sub postmaster.

prove and could be user perception. However, the Adjust Stock & Slow Rollover has been known about
since April. A fix was devised for the problem but a side effect of this was that the order of reports
generated would be different. POL therefore said that the fix was unacceptable as it stood. Fujitsu
began working on the side effect to the fix. This had the effect of making the fix ‘bigger’ in size to the
system. The Counter_S10R_DELTA package, which contains the ‘Slow running Adjust Stock/Balance
snapshot' fix as one of its components was piloted on 30/10/01. The pilot offices were to be monitored
over the balance period and if the fix proves successful, it will be released to the rest of the live estate
- we are currently waiting for details of the suwess of the fix.”

15 POL00393981

16 POL00393981

Page 82 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

The purpose of the Duty Manager making contact would be to better
understand the issue and decide if it met the problem criteria, whether the issue
was a Major Business Continuity Incident and who was best placed to act as
the associated Problem Manager. It is my understanding that historically, this
role would be taken by a Fujitsu employee but that, from approximately 2012
onwards, Post Office employees could also take on the role of Problem
Manager.

127.A Problem Manager (who, in this example would have been a Fujitsu
employee)''” would be allocated to each problem on the basis of their
knowledge, expertise, responsibility and availability. Their role was to ensure
the problem was investigated and resolved and to provide progress reports.

128. Once allocated to a problem, the assigned Problem Manager would contact
the person who had raised the problem. If the Problem Manager accepted that
the issue was a problem, they would then pursue the ‘acceptance routine’,
which included checking Fujitsu’s problem database for previous reports of the
problem, recording supporting evidence and agreeing closure criteria and an
update schedule. The Problem Manager would then develop an action plan,
setting out actions to be taken by specific individuals in relation to the
identification and resolution of the root cause of the problem and the monitoring
of the solution applied.

129. Problems would be closed when the Problem Manager had determined that
the problem could be closed. This would be, as I understand it, reported to Post

Office by Fujitsu. The person who had raised the problem (which may have

"7 It is my understanding, by way of example, that, in 2012, Steve Bansal and Steve Gardiner, who
were both Fujitsu employees, both held the title "Problem Manager”.

Page 83 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

been a sub postmaster) would then be advised by the SSD that it had been

closed.

Incident management

130. Incidents‘"® that occurred with the Horizon system were, as I understand it, to
be managed via function-specific help desks, the focus of which was to resolve
incidents as quickly as possible and restore affected operations.

131. These helpdesks included the HSH, which dealt with ‘System and Technical’
incidents and the NBSC which dealt with ‘business incidents’. BEDs would
technically fall within the definition of System and Technical Incidents. However,
it is my understanding from discussions that I have had with Post Office staff
who were in post at the time, that postmasters would tend to call the NBSC with
most problems that they encountered, which meant that BEDs could also be
reported through the NBSC, even though a BED would not strictly fall within the
definition of a business incident.

132. It is my understanding that incident management would usually involve an
initial investigation (and possible deployment of a temporary procedure),
evidence collection, identification of the incident’s root cause and the

development, testing, release and monitoring of a solution.

118 POL00397084. The RGMA Customer Service Incident Management Process defined these as “Any
event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may cause, an
interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service”

Page 84 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

133. It is my understanding that Fujitsu would report to Post Office regarding
instances of incident management as part of the Service Reporting packs that

it was routinely providing.

Post Incident Review

134. In certain circumstances, a Post Incident Review would be carried out. The
circumstances in which this might occur would be if there was a particular issue
associated with the management of a particular problem or if such a review had
been requested by a third party. I have not seen any documentation that
provides me with further clarification as to who, in this situation, would be
classed as a third party. I anticipate that it is likely that it would be a party that

was not directly involved in the incident management process.

135. The Problem Manager would be responsible for managing the Post Incident
Review, which, as I understand it, involved producing a report to be used as a
means for authorising closure of the problem with signed agreement, of each
party. Any such post-incident reviews would, as I understand it, be reported to
Post Office by Fujitsu as part of the Service Reporting packs that I have referred
to above in relation to the reporting of the incident management process.

136. It is my understanding that the Fujitsu Problem Management Procedures
document was regularly updated as the procedures evolved and that an
equivalent process for incident management was finalised in 2006, entitled

‘RGMA Customer Service Incident Management Process’.''°

2006 — 2013
(a) The identification, investigation, recording and reporting of (i) bugs, errors
and defects in the Horizon IT system (ii) other network system failures or (iii) the

impact of such events on branch accounts.

137. It is my understanding that the internal measures that were put in place to
monitor Fujitsu’s compliance with the matters defined in question 3(b) of the
Rule 9 request (in so far as sections 2(a) and (b) of the Rule 9 request are

concerned) can be summarised as follows in so far as the 2006-2013 period is

concerned:
a. The introduction of new governance structures.
b. Routine testing.

The introduction of new governance structures

138. New governance structures associated with managing the contractual and
operational relationship between Post Office and Fujitsu were introduced by
Schedule A2 of the Codified Agreement in 2006, through what was described
as the Service Management Relationship’ which, as I understand it, was part
of a wider programme to introduce ’Relationships’ into the contractual
governance structure. '2° It is my understanding that, pursuant to the Current
Contract, more discretion was given to the newly created Relationships (in

relation to the frequency of meetings, by way of example). Their creation also

120 Codified Agreement 2006, Version 1, Schedule A2

Page 86 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

appears to have altered the role of the Boards (which I will describe further
below). The Boards, which had previously (pursuant to the 2002 Agreement)
been the subject of more stringent specifications and requirements were,
following the creation of the relationships, defined as the delegated authorities
of those relationships and appear to have been responsible for resolving any
associated day-to-day operational issues that may have arisen. ‘2

139. The four Relationships that governed the Codified Agreement were formed of
various Directors or leads from both Post Office and Fujitsu, which were
detailed in Annex 1 of Schedule A2 of the Current Contract. These four

relationships were:
Systems Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship

140. It is my understanding that this relationship was intended to monitor the
overall success of the relationship between Post Office and Fujitsu, including
the resolution of any disputes escalated for Executive review pursuant to the
Dispute Resolution Procedure (as defined in Schedule A2 of the 2006 Codified
Agreement) and monitor the performance of Fujitsu's obligations in connection
with this Agreement. It appears to have operated at a relatively high level and
was not concerned with whether or not Fujitsu was acting in compliance with

the relevant contractual obligations.

Service Management Relationship

121 Codified Agreement 2006, Version 1, Schedule A2, paragraph 3

Page 87 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

141. It is my understanding that Service Management was a day-to-day function of
managing the relationships with teams responsible for the delivery of the

service. It was also a process through which to, by way of example:

a. review network performance;
b. review operational reliability of Infrastructure
Co consider/recommend remedial courses of action (e.g. full or partial

technological refresh or service level relief); and

d. resolve operational issues including, but not limited to, those arising from
non-conformance to agreed Service Levels, among other important
functions. It also was intended to have the ability to impose financial
penalties, if Fujitsu failed to comply with the relevant contractual
obligations. Any such financial penalties would be in the form of “Service

Credits”, which were referred to in the contract as “liquidated damages”.

142. This forum was intended to meet formally on a monthly basis ‘2? . The monthly
meeting was equivalent to that of the former Service Review Board. The
meetings would discuss matters such as what fixes needed to be developed
and the associated timescales.

143. The information that was provided to the Board would, as I understand it, have
been created and generated by Fujitsu and would have been provided in the
form of a Service Management or Performance Report (which was a more
substantial version of the former Service Review Book, although it was still

prepared on a monthly basis).

122 Codified Agreement 2006, Schedule A2— 'Governance’

Page 88 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Commercial Relationship

144. It is my understanding that the purpose of this Relationship was to manage
and administer the Codified Agreement, agree amendments to it subject to the
Change Control Procedure, perform first level escalation for disputes, whether
about the interpretation of the Codified Agreement itself, or about other matters
such as invoices. It was also intended to monitor, review and report on events

and progress and issue resolution in respect of market testing.
Programme/Release Relationship

145. It is my understanding that the purpose of this relationship under Schedule
A2, Paragraph 4 of the 2006 Agreement, was to provide a governance structure
for the introduction of each new programmes or release (which would be a new
release of counter software elements of Horizon which may contain new
functionality or updates to existing functionality, including fixes for BEDS) by

creating three interlinked boards for it:

a. Programme and Release Boards had the responsibility of overseeing the
development of programmes and releases according to time, budget and
resource. They would manage new Horizon projects and review and
resolve any operational issues that arose during the design and testing
of new HNG-X programmes.

b. Acceptance Boards'*°'*4 were established for each release and were
intended to meet as required to resolve issues arising from Acceptance
activity and testing in accordance with the testing provisions of Schedule

"23 Codified Agreement 2006, Schedule A2- ‘Governance’

B6.3 of the Current Contract. Their purpose was to consider and resolve
Acceptance disputes, Acceptance of the relevant Release and provide
a recommendation to the ‘Joint Release Authorisation Board’ (see
paragraph 145(c) below). An example is the HNG-X Acceptance
Board,'° which had the primary purpose of carrying out testing,
measuring results against criteria and making a recommendation to the
JRAB as to whether software could be released into the trial or into the
Horizon system according to the stipulations of Schedule B6.3 of the
Current Contract.

c. JRABs were established to agree the criteria and processes through
which Releases would be authorised, following and acting on
recommendations from the Acceptance Board, for release into field trial
or live operation and carry out readiness reviews of stakeholders

accordingly. '26

d. It is my understanding that this Board would determine how and if to
progress new solutions or changes to solutions through to the
acceptance stage. This assessment appears to have been based on
whether the project as stand-alone entity was ready to be implemented.
This would necessitate considerations such as whether Fujitsu and
Post Office were ready for the proposed release and that associated

communications with postmasters and other internal stakeholders had

125 Another example of such a Board was the HNG-X Acceptance Dispute Board, the purpose of
which, I understand, was to settle Acceptance disputes.

126 Previously this function appears to have been carried out by the Service Management Forum (a
forum that included Post Office and Fujitsu members), which in accordance with the 2002 Agreement,
would agree the processes by which releases would be authorised for release into field trial or live
operation and would carry out readiness reviews.

Page 90 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

been completed. For example, they would decide when the Live Pilot

and Live Monitoring of releases would commence.

e. They would receive recommendations from the Acceptance Boards as
to whether the acceptance criteria had been met and if they had, asa

result, a change to the Horizon system could be approved. '2”
Routine testing

146. Routine testing remained a feature of the contractual relationship from 2006
onwards as stated in Schedule B1.1 and Schedule D6 of the Current
Contract. 176

147. It is my understanding that non-functional testing (which is testing that is
focussed on the performance of the system rather than the actual functions
created (such as how long it takes for the system to respond to a button press
against the question of whether Post Office has the right button to press)) was
conducted. This testing was conducted by the Vulnerability Management
Service'?®, which worked to identify and reduce vulnerabilities in the HNG-X
application. Although these tests were designed to identify potential problems
arising from malicious digital attacks (such as Viruses, Trojans and Worms),
vulnerabilities caused by configuration errors such as BEDs within software
were also identified.'°° This is described in the document entitled ‘HNG-X

Architecture — Security Architecture’ which was dated 24 September 2014.15!

148. There were, as I understand it, a series of tests which were used, which I
describe further below. I am able to describe the tests that were run, based on
the information that I have been provided with to prepare this statement.
However, I have not had sight of all of the test reports associated with those
tests. This means that I am unable to provide the Inquiry with any useful level
of detail as to the outcome of the tests.

149. The tests that were run were, as I understand it, as follows:

a. Quarterly Approved Scanning Vendor scanning'® - This involved
sample testing, carried out by an external party, of various aspects of the
Horizon Architecture (such as routers, servers and wireless access
points) for the purpose of ensuring PCI compliance (as described further
above). The external party would produce a report detailing adherence,
potential risks and suggested actions. '*>

b. Penetration Testing'** was required pursuant to the 2006 Codified
Agreement'®® and occurred either on an annual basis for all systems, or
when a significant change to a specific system was implemented. The
testing would use methods that might otherwise be used by hackers or
those wishing to cause harm to a system in order to be able to identify
faults or vulnerabilities in the system that required patching. '°°

c. Disaster Failover Testing occurred annually for the HNG-X systems
and would involve a deliberate failure of the main production datacentre

being engineered for the purposes of testing the resilience of the backup

site.197"5® It is my understanding that specific individuals would be
assigned to plan and conduct the testing. For example, in 2008, Brian
Pinder (Fujitsu) was given overall responsibility for testing the
vulnerability of the PCI datacentres'®® while Mark Harvard (an external
contractor from Computacenter) was instructed to develop the low-level

test plan.'4°

150. If penetration or vulnerability testing identified a BED, the Network Security

Management team assessed it and would either, as I understand it: "41

a. approve an immediate/scheduled IOS fix as bug was already known to

the project and the fix had already been tested and approved for

deployment;

b. interrogate the relevant logs to gather more information;

os notify the product supplier of the issue (using the standard support
route);

d. escalate the issue within the organisation following the project
procedures.

151. It is my understanding that significant findings from the testing were tracked
via a remediation plan and technical risk assessment and could be escalated
to the Information Security Management Forum (“ISMF”) Risk Register.

152. The testing that I have described above was carried out in accordance with

industry standards and, by way, of example, to ensure compliance with

Payment Card Industry Standards (“PCI”).142149144145146147146149 For example,
the process for card payments through the Horizon System was benchmarked
against the PCI council’s recommendations. 19°151152153154155156157158 Fujitsu
were also required to demonstrate their adherence to PCI standards in the
provision of the Horizon service to Post Office. It is my understanding that
sometimes, Post Office utilised the formal CCN procedure to make it a
contractual term for Fujitsu to meet these specifications. '°°

153. Post Office monitored Fujitsu's PCl compliance closely using Weekly
Highlight Reports for PCI compliance which tracked where Fujitsu were failing
to meet their auditing or build requirements. 1°""®2

154. Post Office also had a PCI Incident Response Plan in place from 18 February
2008, which set out key information relating to processes to be followed in
managing defined PCI Incidents, including definitions of Minor and Major

Incidents, roles and responsibilities at various stages of the Incident

management process, the method by which management would be informed

of an incident, and reporting and testing requirements. '°°

b) The adoption of measures to rectify bugs, errors and defects within the

Horizon IT system
PEAKs and KELs

155. I understand from a Terms of Reference document dated 30 July 2014, that
Fujitsu convened a Business Impact Forum, as part of the Customer Service
Improvement Plan, whose remit was to meet weekly to “govern the assignment
of PEAK Incidents”. I have detailed further below that I have been unable to
establish Post Office’s involvement with this Forum. PEAK was the incident and
problem management system used by Fujitsu to log, diagnose and track the
progress of reported Horizon incidents and problems from detection to
resolution. Each incident/problem was assigned a PEAK number. '°*

156. It is my understanding that not all PEAKS would have been taken to or
discussed at the BIF and it is not clear to me how Fujitsu determined which

PEAKS, if any, merited escalation to the BIF.

157. On the basis of the information that I have reviewed for the purposes of this
statement, it appears that for each PEAK being considered there should have

been one of the following outcomes:

a. (i) Approved by the BIF, and the PEAK was to targeted in the next part
of the meeting, being the Peak Targeting Forum. It is my understanding

that this means it was accepted there was an error so that the PEAK
could be added to the KEL;

b. (ii) Request further information (from originator or other) and defer
to a subsequent BIF; or

e (iii) Add to the KEL and close the Peak.

158. The processes appear to have been designed to consider a range of factors
associated with the control and assignment of PEAKs, including, severity of the
business impact, impacts of development, estimating, employment and costs
of resolutions. It is my understanding that a PEAK would be considered either
within the Business Impact Forum (if approved from a list of potential PEAKs to
be considered), and separately the PEAK Targeting Forum would “agree a
target release for a PEAK'® brought to the Forum”.‘®

159. The Terms of Reference document that I have referred to above appears to
have been Fujitsu-generated, and although it includes the Post Office logo, I
am unable tell from the document itself what Post Office’s involvement in the
BIF was. From a LinkedIn search that I have carried out as part of my
preparation from this statement, I have been able to confirm that all the
individuals listed amongst the membership and representation for the Business
Impact Forum in this document were Fujitsu rather than Post Office employees .
I also note that the document did not provide for any external circulation. I have
made enquiries with members of the Post Office business who were in post at

the relevant time to try and ascertain further information as to whether Post

Office was involved in this forum, and/or the degree of any such involvement
with and/or Post Office’s knowledge of the reporting from this forum, but
unfortunately I have not been able to ascertain any further information which
would enable me to assist the Inquiry further on this issue.

160. I have reviewed a set of Fujitsu PowerPoint slides dated (from an analysis of
the metadata) 18 December 2015. These slides appear to refer to the role of
the Business Impact Forum in the ‘lifecycle of a defect’ and set out proposals
for Post Office to become involved through a ‘Joint Emergency Business
Impact Forum’ which, it is stated, would be attended by Post Office Head of
Service.

161. However, as has been the case with many documents in this statement, I
have reviewed this document in isolation and have not seen any
contemporaneous related documents As a result, I am not able to confirm when
and to what extent the processes referred to in the slides were ultimately
established, but a later operational spreadsheet that I have seen indicates that
Post Office did authorise certain releases through a joint Business Impact

Forum (the example I have seen is from 2019).'®”

ATOS and the Tower Model

162. Fujitsu was, and remains, one of a number of IT contractors engaged by Post
Office to facilitate various aspects of its business infrastructure. Other
contractors, by way of example, included Accenture, IBM, Verizon,
Computacenter (the “Supply Chain Members”). These contractual
arrangements formed what was defined as the Post Office IT Supply Chain.

163. As was increasingly considered best practice across the public sector at the
time, Post Office concluded by 2013 that management of the Supply Chain
Members needed to be centralised and optimised, in order to facilitate better
oversight of the maintenance and service associated with Post Office 's IT
systems.

164. In 2013, following a successful procurement process, ATOS was appointed

to manage the overall performance of a number of these Service Towers.

165. It is my understanding, based on discussions that I have had with colleagues
who were in post between 2013-2019 (which I refer to further below) and from
the document entitled “Post Office IT&C Transformation Project Procurement
Guide® that ATOS was responsible for managing incumbent suppliers of
Post Office's IT systems, which included Fujitsu.

166. It is my understanding that ATOS’s approach, on appointment, was to adopt
System Integration and Management (SIAM) tools to track incidents,

problems and the change process across the Supply Chain membership. '©°

167. I have reviewed a document entitled, ‘POL S/SD governance Model: Terms
of Reference’ dated 21 March 2014,'7° which illustrates how the working
relationship between ATOS, Post Office and the Supply Chain Members was
intended to be structured through a series of forums, each of which would have
a focussed remit and report ‘upwards’. The forums were categorised into the
following levels: strategic, “S”, management, “M”, and operational, “O”. The

structure of these forums was, as I understand it, as follows:

168. The recollection of the colleagues that I have spoken to who were involved at

an operational level with these arrangements between 2013 and 2019 was that

the ‘O’, operational and ‘M’ management forums were all established and

implemented through regular meetings with formalised reporting structures.

However, in practice, the S1 (CIO Steering Committee), S2 (Enterprise

Architecture Committee) and S3 (Executive Relationship Forum) were not

formally stood up. The shared understanding and recollection from my

colleagues was that instead, the topics that should have been discussed at the

"S" level meetings were discussed at quarterly meetings at the executive level.

169. Having read the Terms of Reference for the SISD Governance Model, it

appears that the operational meetings were low level meetings, the outputs of

which were escalated to the management meetings (if required).

Page 100 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

170. Mandatory attendees at the ‘M4 - IT supplier & Service Committee’. from
Post Office were: IT Change Lead, IT Procurement Lead, IT Governance and
Controls, ISA Senior Compliance Manager, BRM Lead, and from ATOS:
Service Delivery Director, Service Managers, and CTO.

171. The objectives of the M4 forum included:

“a) Review effectiveness of the IT operation: - governance — services
performance — services scorecard and policies b) SISD Programme Level Issue
Resolution Level 3 Escalation — RUN/BAU Issues”, and “Establishes and
manage SLAs, Contractual Breaches to invoke penalties or incentive

payment”.171

172.The objectives also included a_ requirement to, “Manage
Commercial/contractual aspects of IT Suppliers (new and existing)” and
“Manage top-level service risks and issues”, but for the reasons set out below,
my understanding is that this would have applied to most Supply Chain
Members but not to Fujitsu.

173. The M4 forum was supposed to meet monthly, for 1 day, and to consider in

spreadsheet from:

“a) Supplier performance review (Operational Scorecard Summary with key
KPIs — consolidated service performance exceptions and resolution plans b)
Escalation from Issue Management Level 2: Escalated SISD Programme Level

issues — RUN/BAU issues (SSID 4.0 Governance & Assurance)” and “The

WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

detailed performance booklet of all the Incumbent SCM’s SLAs/Scorecards (IT

Service etc.)”.17?

174. M4 was tasked to produce, Minutes and a record of “/ssue Resolution or
Further Escalations to Level 4 (CIO Management Committee)”."7°

175. The mandatory attendees at M5 ISMF meetings were, as I understand it, in
so far as Post Office was concerned, the Information Security and Assurance
Group (“ISAG”) Senior Technical Assurance Manager'’*, and from ATOS:
Security Operations Manager, Risk Manager, and SISD Quality Manager.
Supply Chain Member representatives of Security Operations and Risk and
Audit Compliance were optional attendees. '7°

176. It is my understanding that, during the period of the ATOS contract, Post
Office would continue to attend ISMF meetings but that ATOS would chair the
meetings and the associated reporting would be in the ATOS proposed format.

177. The structure illustrated in the SISD Terms of Reference document that I have
referred to above was supported by a number of more detailed documents

which set out the nature of ATOS’s service provision.

178. By way of example, I have reviewed an ATOS prepared document entitled
‘POL Security Management Plan [Draft]’ from July 2013’'7° which outlined how

the provision of services by ATOS to Post Office would achieve an adequate

172 POL00398100, p.34

73 POL00398100, p.36

174 It is my understanding that this would normally be a project role assuring the build standards being
applied by technical development teams.

75 POL00398100, p.39

176 POLO0399459

Page 102 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

level of security. That document contained a number of specific examples as to

how that objective would be achieved in practice:

a. ‘Information Security Incident and Weakness Reporting’’’Page 33,
8.9.1 — ‘Accounting and Audit’,'7®

b. Under 8.11 ‘Fault Logging’,'”°

179. The development of ATOS’s role in managing the service provided to Post
Office by its Supply Chain Members is further demonstrated by the fact that, in
2012, Post Office produced its own IT & Change Weekly Highlights Report 1°
whereas by 2013 ‘risks and issues logs’ '*' were maintained and produced by
ATOS.

180. In a later IT&C Transformation Programme Executive dashboard dated 14
December 2012, it was stated that Fujitsu had retrenched from the proposed
obligations detailed in the Transitional Support Service contract to the
obligations and timelines detailed in the Codified Agreement. "8? This
appears to have delayed the implementation of “milestones” for the Tower

model as defined by the IT&C Board at the start of 2013.1

77 POL00401508, p.14. §4.2 “Any suspected Information Security incident or weakness associated
with the Post Office Ltd. Service which is identified/suspected by Atos staff will be reported to the
contract Service Desk who will then follow the escalation procedures for the Incident and Problem
Management, whilst ensuring reporting is escalated to both Atos, Post Office Ltd. And the Supply Chain,
where appropriate.”

178 POL00401508, p.33. §8.9.1 ‘The Atos Post Office Ltd. Security Operations Manager will review
physical and logical logs in order to meet service consumer requirements. Furthermore, as defined
within Schedule 2.5, Atos will conduct compliance reviews across the Supply Chain where appropriate
to ensure service levels are maintained.’

recorded in the Service Desk.”

181. By 2013, Post Office anticipated that the provision of the Horizon system by
Fujitsu would soon be replaced by an alternative system which was to be
provided by IBM. As a result, it is my understanding that the lack of agreement
from Fujitsu in relation to the Tower model structure that I have described above
was not assessed to be problematic at that stage.

182. It is my understanding that Fujitsu did report to ATOS in some respects, and
ATOS was responsible for large parts of monitoring of Fujitsu’s daily

compliance with its contractual obligations (at a service level).

183. However, it is my understanding that the underlying responsibility for
managing the Fujitsu’s contract, monitoring Fujitsu’s compliance with the
relevant contractual obligations and assessing and taking forward any
associated consequences in relation to the breach of those obligations
remained with Post Office throughout the 2013-2019 period.

184. As a result, there was a separation between the management and monitoring
of the service that was provided by Fujitsu pursuant to the Codified Agreement
and the management and monitoring of services provided to Post Office by

other IT suppliers.
ATOS monitoring and reporting in relation to the Horizon service as provided by
Fujitsu

185.1 have reviewed an ATOS “POL Service Level Tracker’, which includes a
consolidated table for Fujitsu’s monthly service level performance throughout

2017, including SLAs for exception and error resolution. '®*

184 POL00325396

Page 104 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

186.1 have also reviewed a draft document titled “Post Office SISD Contract
Handbook” which appears to indicate the different types of reports that ATOS
was supposed to provide to the Post Office. These included reports in relation
to performance management, such as monthly performance management
reports, quarterly summaries, continuous maintenance schedules and periodic
satisfaction surveys taken across the supply chain. '®°

187. It is my understanding that, in practice, during this period Fujitsu would attend
meetings and provide agreed reporting to ATOS'® but would not pursue
actions in relation to their contractual obligations unless instructed by Post
Office.

188. ATOS appears to have engaged, on a daily basis, with Fujitsu in respect of,
among other things, reporting, SLA achievement, problem management and
the Horizon service desk. ATOS regularly produced packages of data (for
example, Service Review Reports,'®? an ‘Atos Dashboard' and ‘Atos
Performance Summary','®® Service Desk Risk Logs,'® Service Level
Trackers'°°). However, I have not been able to establish the extent to which
Fujitsu’s compliance with the relevant contractual obligations was captured
within that reporting.

189. It is my understanding that there were no contractual provisions in place that
required ATOS to carry out monitoring of Fujitsu's compliance with the relevant
contractual obligations. It is my understanding that, during the period of the

ATOS contract, the Fujitsu/ Post Office problem management processes (which

are set out at paragraphs 123-129 above and which were used to monitor the
relevant contractual obligations in the period that pre-dated the Tower Model
and ATOS's involvement) appear to have been maintained and updated where
new functionality was introduced but otherwise came under the umbrella of the
Current Contract. It therefore was, as I understand it, through those processes
that Post Office monitored Fujitsu’s compliance with relevant contractual
obligations as defined in sections 2(a) and (b) during the period of the ATOS
contract.

190. I have detailed below, based on a review of associated documentation from

that period, how that process appears to have worked in practice.

191. In March 2013, a joint working document was prepared for review between
Fujitsu and Post Office titled ‘Operational Business Change — Branch
Operational Level Agreement’ v.1.4.'9' This document appears to have referred
to the interaction between Post Office and Fujitsu in the delivery of the OBC
Branch Service for changes in branches '®”. It was a non-contractual agreement
providing further clarification of the procedures used to deliver that service, and
the measures that will be reviewed to assess its effectiveness.

192.In the same month, an interface agreement (CCD) was prepared and
circulated for approval.'®* The purpose of the CCD was referred to as being to
“establish effective co-operation between Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd

for the timely efficient and cost effective delivery of Operational Business

191 POL00397932

182 The OBC process is a process used to make minor changes that would not require any
amendment to the Codified Agreement. The opening of a new branch would be one such example of
a minor change.

193 POL00397971

Page 106 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Change using Reference Data to HNG-X enabled Post Office counters”.'°* The
document was updated to reflect changes to the Reference Data Management
Service and provided that Fujitsu would work jointly with Post Office to “improve
the quality and effectiveness of the Reference Data interface”'®®. Pursuant to
this agreement, Fujitsu were required to “produce reports and send them to the
relevant PO unit, and PO are to check reports and if errors are found submit a
fresh change and should PO find an error during the 48 hour window a direct
request to Fujitsu (usually by telephone) may be made to stop the release of
the data. In this instance the release is no longer pre-authorised and becomes

a change which requires authorisation” .'°°

193. The document also set out the process for processing errors, specifically

outlining that all observed errors would be recorded as pre-live incidents. 1°”
There was also discussion within the document about processes for addressing
Peaks and the “agreed mechanisms for passing Peaks from the Fujitsu
Services Peak system to Post Office Ltd and entering responses from Post

Office Ltd into the Peak system’”.1%°

194.1 have also reviewed a document that was entitled ‘Security Management

Service Description’ dated 4 April 2014 which set out the approach to problem

reporting and compliance in respect of Security Incidents. '9°2°° In the sections

194 POL00397971, p.19

195 POL00397971, p.20

196 POL00397971, p.28

197 POL00397971, p.59

198 POL00397971, p.64

199 POL00393768

200 A Security Incident is described in Post Office policy documents (e.g. POL00395097 as "an
adverse event or series of events that comprises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of RAGA
information or information technology assets, having an adverse impact on Fujitsu Services’
reputation, brand, performance or ability to meet its reyulatory or legal obligations.” Such incidents
could include a cyber-attack, the loss of a secure asset or a report of password sharing (at the lowest

level).

Page 107 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

outlining the Security Management Services’ focus on incident reporting and
problem resolution,?°' it was “agreed between POL and FUJS these will be
produced and made available to the Information Security Management Forum
(ISMF) and Service Management Reviews (SMR)."

195. It is my understanding that some important aspects of the HNG-X did not have
Service Level Agreements and were developed and operated without reference
to ATOS. An example of this in practice can be found in the September 2014
‘HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture’ agreement between Post Office
and Fujitsu.2°? This agreement created an automated event reporting
mechanism that detected issues and created alerts and reports concerning
network-wide patterns that could suggest a network error or failure to the Fujitsu
account security team, which was known as the Security Event and Information
Monitoring ("SEIMS”) system. Any incidents would be escalated through the
ISMF, and if necessary, the major incident process.

196. I have also reviewed a document entitled ‘Description of Fujitsu’s System of
IT Infrastructure Services supporting Post Office Limited’s POLSAP and NHG-
X applications’, with iterations for the period April 2013 to December 20137
and April 2014 to December 2014? which describe particular mechanisms for
reporting, auditing and incident management of those services, apparently
without reference to ATOS.

197.In 2016, it is my understanding that the arrangements for Problem

Management interfaces were formally revisited to take account of the role of

201 POL00393768, p.12-14. §§2.1.8- 2.1.12.4.
202 POL00398421
203 POL00235089
204 POL00399609

Page 108 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

ATOS. A document entitled, ‘Fujitsu Services / Post Office Limited Interface
agreement for the Problem Management Interface’, dated 9 March 2016, set
out “the working relationship between Fujitsu Services and Post Office Limited
for the Problem Management interface between ATOS, on behalf of Post
Office, and Fujitsu Services Post Office Account [and defined] the interaction
required between ATOS, on behalf of Post Office and Post Office Account when
cross-domain problems are raised and reviewed.”*°> The agreement set out the

three parties’ respective responsibilities as follows:

“5 Responsibilities

5.1 Joint

Each party is responsible for maintaining and updating their own problem
databases.

When a new cross-domain problem is identified in either domain the party
who identified the problem is to submit a new Problem Record Template (See
Appendix 1) to the other party, thereby ensuring a consistent problem record
exists in both domains.

Both parties will maintain a shared cross-domain Problem Management
spreadsheet which is independently updated on a weekly basis by both
parties and reviewed on a weekly basis at a cross-domain Problem
Management review. This spreadsheet is to detail the problem record
reference for both domains.

Each party will nominate a problem manager for all cross-domain problems.

205 POL00401517

Page 109 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Each party will ensure their counterpart problem manager is appraised as
appropriate of the current situation/status of the problems. Both parties will
authorise Temporary Procedures/Authorised Temporary Procedures
impacting on the Post Office operating process for cross-domain problems.
Both parties will provide incident reference(s) from their respective service
desk calls to the associated cross-domain problems. Each party will ensure
their counterpart problem manager is notified if problem ownership changes
(i.e. if ownership changes from one FJ POA problem manager to another the
original problem manager must notify their counterpart problem manager and
vice versa).

5.2 ATOS Specific Responsibilities.

ATOS Problem Management will own the weekly problem report spreadsheet,
which should detail all ‘open’ problems, including those that it has been jointly
agreed should be on ‘monitoring’. POL will manage aspects of any problem
relating to the operating process within the Post Office front line e.g., office
process & back end systems e.g. CFS, etc. POL own management of any
planned communication with the branches, e.g., Message Broadcast Service.
5.3 Fujitsu POA Specific Responsibilities

Fujitsu Services POA will update and maintain individual problem records in
their Problem Management Database. Fujitsu Services POA will manage any
problems technical and physical originating in the Fujitsu domain. Fujitsu
Services POA will undertake an annual review of problem records from the

perspective of identifying from those records any trends for which underlying

Page 110 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

cause corrective actions could be implemented. E.g., Process improvements,

additional test methodologies, etc.’?°°

(b) The adoption of measures to rectify bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon

IT system

198. It is my understanding that the arrangements and measures that were put in
place to rectify BEDs in the Horizon system that I detailed above in paragraphs
155-161 continued until 2016 when the ‘Fujitsu Services/Post Office Limited
Interface agreement for the Problem Management Interface’ that I have referred
to above was introduced.

199. The Interface explained the processes for remedying problems in the Horizon
IT system which continued to involve the investigation of a problem’s root cause
(including through the introduction of temporary procedures as necessary?°’)

and the application of an effective solution.

200. Whereas problem management had previously been primarily the
responsibility of an appointed Fujitsu Problem Manager (see paragraphs 123-
129), under the Interface ATOS Problem Management and Fujitsu would
manage problems collaboratively and (as noted above in paragraph 192) both
parties would appoint problem managers in relation to cross-domain problems
which would include BEDs and other system problems. The Interface document

summarises the problem management responsibilities held by ATOS Problem

206 POL00401517, p.9.
207 POL00393885. Temporary procedures could be used as an interim solution for a problem until such

time as a permanent solution to the problem was established.

Page 111 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Management and Fujitsu in relation to the investigation of problems, information

sharing. agreement to temporary procedures and problem closure, as follows:

a. “Management of any cross-domain problem will include the following
stages:

b. Analysis (to determine root cause)

Co Control (TP or ATP implementation, escalation)

d. Resolution (review and closure)

e. Analysis —

f. The relevant domain (which would be the party that was required to carry

out the analysis, whether that was Fujitsu, a third-party domain? or
ATOS) will carry out the analysis to determine the extent and impact of
any specific problem. It may also mean the implementation of “traps” to
pick up any further occurrences before the root cause can be
established. Once the root cause has been established, a description
and date identified will be disseminated to the other business as an
effective measure of the Problem Management process. As the analysis
progresses initial perceived root causes may change.

g. Incident Matching - Both domains will exchange volumes of incidents to
associated problems to an agreed timescale which would normally be
on a weekly basis (dependant on the problem).

h. Control - This covers escalation of problems as necessary and the
introduction of Temporary Procedures (TP - exclusive to each domain

but does not impact the other domain in conducting it’s business as

208 It is my understanding that this definition could relate to a technical domain used to provide services.

Page 112 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

usual) or Authorised Temporary Procedures (ATP - Agreed between
each party). Audit trails will also be maintained within each domain that
enable tracking of actions or interaction between the two domains.

i Resolution — Cross domain problems can only be closed when both
domains agree that the closure criterion has been met without
compromising any other services. Both domains will provide a review of
all problems to determine if the solution provided has actually removed
the problem. Closure may be after a monitoring period and will be agreed

by both parties.’2°9

201. The document made detailed provision for associated processes, such as a
Problem Management Operation Review Forum, and a Post Problem
Implementation Review Meeting. There were provisions for escalation that
required ATOS ultimately to escalate to an ATOS senior manager a problem in

their domain, and Fujitsu to escalate directly to Post Office.

The ‘Horizons Issues Working Group’

202. Separately from these processes, a ‘Horizon Issues Working Group’ held a
call between July 2013 to around March 2019 and met broadly weekly initially
and fortnightly after 2014. From October 2013, the call came within the remit of
the Branch Training and Support Programme. The purpose of this Working
Group was to identify and discuss issues which might impact on or be impacted
by the points raised in Second Sight’s interim report.2"° It was set up so that the

209 POL00401517, p.11
210 POL00137533

WITN03680200

right people across the Post Office business had the appropriate level of
visibility to ensure a consistent approach was adopted to managing issues
raised with Horizon. Minutes show specific complaints from branches and other

sources were discussed, and their escalation and resolution tracked.

Monitoring by the Strategic Group Executive and the POL Board

Risk and Compliance Committee

203. Post Office’s Risk and Compliance Committee was, until 2012, a Board
Level Committee. However, from 2012 onwards, it was a Strategic Group
Executive (SEG or GE) level Committee. The references below to the
Committee relate to the period from 2012 onwards.

204. It appears that one of the purposes of Post Office‘s Risk and Compliance
Committee (in addition to monitoring Post Office’s PCI compliance (and wider
compliance with industry standards) 2"'), was also to monitor any contractual
non-compliance by members of the Post Office Supply Chain (including
Fujitsu), enforce compliance?’ and track any associated work undertaken by
the contracting party .21° 214 215 216 It is my understanding that formal internal
reports were occasionally produced 2'7*'® For example, ATOS were criticised

in a June 2016 Chief Information Officer (”C1O”) Risk and Issues Log for failing

205.1 have reviewed the minutes of a meeting of the Risk and Compliance
Committee which took place on 28 September 2016.22° This was attended by
(among others) CEO Paula Vennells, CFO Alisdair Cameron, GC Jane
MacLeod, and representatives from Ernst & Young. The Committee discussed
a Horizon outage that had occurred on 9 May 2016 and the ‘/essons learned’
from that, incident, including what changes were required to be made to IT
systems and incident management process. It was stated “clear information
flow and joint working has been established with ATOS”.?*1

206. The document suggests that by May 2017 Post Office was acknowledging
there were some difficulties in the arrangement with ATOS. The minutes of a
Risk and Compliance Committee meeting on 4 May 201722suggest that the
committee was informed that, “Problems are actioned and then closed by Atos
without PO’s knowledge or briefing. Once a call is logged there is no visibility
for PO as to how it is dealt with. The problem management process needs to
be further improved as Atos do not review problems from suppliers out with
their tower arrangement.”

207. It is my understanding from the conversations with colleagues who were in
post between 2013-2019 that it eventually became clear that there was a list of
services that ATOS was not able to fulfil pursuant to the Tower Model. This was
because ATOS consistently failed to deliver a sustainable service, improve
technology, manage the IT Supply Chain or add value across the service lines

by communicating effectively and performing effective root cause analysis.?2°

208. As a result, Post Office incrementally began to end the services being
delivered pursuant to the ATOS contract and conducted a staged exit from that
contract between 2018 and 2020.

209. A document dated July 2018 indicates how Post Office analysed its position

at the time:2%4

“3. Lack of formal systems integrator and SLA monitoring Finding ...

The Branch Technology project?25 is heavily reliant on third party vendors, to

deliver the project. POL are following the Government's Towers Operating

Model to deliver the project. Computacenter are responsible for the hardware

base build and coordinating the installation of the terminals, via a further third

party (ByBox). Fujitsu have been responsible for the development of the
application and Atos are responsible for first line support. However, the review
identified:

a. There is no longer a systems integrator to coordinate the activities of the
third parties to support successful delivery. Project Team members have
tried to fill this role by meeting with vendors on a regular basis to fix
urgent issues. However, these activities are not centrally coordinated
and the outcomes of the meetings are not shared across the entirety of
the third party eco-system.

b. We were informed that POL have not been able to alternatively contract
without additional risk and cost, however this decision has not been

documented.

224 POL00400632

225 POL00400397 describes the Branch Technology Project as starting in 2015 and being "...initially

scheduled to deliver 22.500 counter terminals by June 2018 at a total cost of £49m' I understand, from

this document, that costs increased by 9% as a result of an incorrect estimate of the number of terminals
required and associated licensing costs.

c. We acknowledge that difficulties have been experienced with
Computacenter’s delivery of the project and contract managers receive
high level performance information but this is not detailed information
that is aligned to SLAs.

d. As a result, monitoring of SLA performance is not performed by the
project (due to lack of SLA knowledge) or by contract managers (due to
lack of detailed information). The contract managers are also not part of
the project management team.

e. Risk.”

There is a risk that POL pay for services that are not delivered or contractual
requirements are not fulfilled.’226

210. ATOS's role in the service management of or reporting in respect of Fujitsu

was one of the first services that was stopped.

211. The structure illustrated in the SISD Terms of Reference document that I have

referred to above at paragraph 165 was supported by a number of more

detailed documents which set out the nature of ATOS’s service provision.

212. Whilst Post Office was able to structure its contracts with most of its Supply

Chain Members to facilitate each of them reporting to and engaging with ATOS

under the Tower scheme that I have described above, Fujitsu did not agree to

amend the terms of the Current Contract to facilitate it engaging with ATOS in

the same way. I have reviewed an IT and Change (“IT&C”) Programme

Transformation Programme Board Update from 16 April 2012 which refers to

the fact that a low level of engagement from Fujitsu was causing issues to the

Page 118 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

successful management of the procurement process for the IT&C
Transformation programme.”2”

213. However, when it subsequently transpired that the Horizon system would not
be replaced by an IBM product, it was necessary to instead extend Fujitsu's
provision of Horizon. The consequence of this was that Fujitsu’s delivery of the
Horizon system did not sit effectively within the Tower Model.

214. As a result, there was a separation between the management and monitoring
of the service that was provided by Fujitsu pursuant to the Codified Agreement
and the management and monitoring of services provided to Post Office by
other IT suppliers.

215. ATOS appears to have engaged, on a daily basis, with Fujitsu in respect of,
among other things, reporting, SLA achievement, problem management and
the Horizon service desk. ATOS regularly produced packages of data (for
example, Service Review Reports,??® an ‘Atos Dashboard' and ‘Atos
Performance Summary’,?° Service Desk Risk Logs,?°° Service Level
Trackers?*'). However, I have not been able to establish the extent to which
Fujitsu’s compliance with the relevant contractual obligations was captured

within that reporting.

216. ATOS's role in the service management of or reporting in respect of Fujitsu

was one of the first services that was stopped.

Contractual updates relating to Post Office’s internal monitoring of Fujitsu’s

compliance with the relevant contractual obligations as defined in sections 2(a)

and (b)

217. On 3 July 2017, schedules of updates to the Current Contract recorded the
agreed process for recording whether Fujitsu was fulfilling its delivery
obligations in respect of Project HNG-X.?°? It included a mechanism for
managing ‘rectification activities’ that were required to fulfil any Acceptance
Criteria that Fujitsu had not met. It described the ‘incident severity matrix’ which
was, as I understand it, used to categorise incidents based on their severity and
impact on the HNG-X Acceptance Process.?°°

218. To summarise, these were:

a. High Severity: Incidents that result from HNG-X or associated changes
causing defects which rendered critical elements of Business
Capabilities, Support Facilities, or Infrastructure unfit for operational use.
Examples include preventing transactions, hindering business inputs or
outcomes, or causing performance issues that breach service level

targets.

233 POL00393769, p.22, Annex A

Page 120 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

b. Medium Severity: Incidents resulting from HNG-X changes causing
defects that do not stop operations but create problems in using certain

transaction types.

c. Low Severity: Incidents caused by HNG-X changes resulting in defects
without any adverse operational impact or those that can be resolved by

Fujitsu Services without affecting Post Office operations.

d. Non-Incident: Cases investigated and no defects, unrelated to HNG-X

changes, or not part of the HNG-X Acceptance Process.

219. Annex C of the document described a number of ‘acceptance methods’
through which Post Office could satisfy itself that Fujitsu had met the service
levels required of it pursuant to the Current Contract.?54

220. It is my understanding that HNG-X Acceptance the status of an incident. If
they could not agree then the incident would be escalated to the HNG-X
Acceptance Dispute Board for resolution. In the event that an HNG-X
Acceptance Dispute cannot be resolved by the Dispute Board, it would be
escalated for Executive Review and dealt with in accordance with the Dispute

Acceptance Procedure.3>

Senior/Board monitoring of Fujitsu’s contractual compliance (whether through

direct oversight or receiving reporting).

221. I have not been able to establish a clear picture of the extent to which the

Post Office Board, the Board sub-committees, the Strategic Executive Group

234 POL00393769, p.24, Annex C
235 POL00325152

Page 121 of 255

WITN03680200

(formerly Group Executive) and its sub-committees were involved in the
monitoring of Fujitsu’s compliance with the relevant contractual obligations as
defined in sections 2(a)-(b).

222. From the documents that I have reviewed, it does appear that there was some
monitoring at those senior levels.

223. To the limited extent I have been able to establish it (and locate assoc iated

documents) I have detailed this further below.

POL Fujitsu Executive Steering Board

224. It is my understanding that the Post Office / Fujitsu Executive Steering Board
appears to have met between January 20147°° and September 20167%” with the
purposes of acting as the primary technology leadership group and the most
senior open?** forum in Post Office’s technological infrastructure.

225. It is my understanding, based on the limited associated information and
documentation that has been able to be located for that period, that the purpose
of the Board was to bring the technological leadership teams from the two
organisations (Post Office and Fujitsu) together, act as a point of escalation for
disputes and to oversee financial and service performance.?°°

226. It is my understanding that, for the meetings held by this Board, PowerPoints
were produced which included analyses of: Fujitsu's performance against

service levels (such as those relating to branch network services and data

236 POL00398082
237 POL00400086
238 I have not been able to establish what "open” means in this context despite making internal enquiries
within Post Office.

centre operations);?“° the identified risks within the contractual relationship;

contractual compliance;7*' and current service descriptions.242

227. It is also my understanding that the group commissioned external reviews and
considered the extent to which actions needed to be taken pursuant to the
findings of those reviews. 24° It is also my understanding that the group
specifically discussed ways in which BEDs and NSFs may arise, for example,
as a result of inefficient capacity testing.244 The group appears to have
recommended actions and assigned owners to specific risks that specifically
related to the relevant contractual obligations within sections 2(a) and (b) of the

Rule 9 request, such as functional issues caused by legacy operating

systems.745
Reporting to the Post Office Board

228. I have reviewed the Minutes of a Board Meeting which took place in January
2015, with a pack of papers for a Board Meeting that was scheduled to occur

on 25 March 2015.246

229. In those Minutes, it is recorded that an update was provided to the Board by
the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (“ARC”). Minutes of meetings of the

ARC were also included in the papers provided to the Post Office Board.”4”

230. I have also reviewed a set of Post Office Board Minutes from a meeting that
took place on 25 July 201674*. In those minutes, reference is made to the
Chairman of the ARC updating the Board in relation to IT Security and a Horizon
outage. It is my understanding, from those Minutes, that the Board requested a
further strategy update in January 2017. However, as has been the case with
other documents in this statement, I have reviewed this set of minutes in
isolation and, as a result, have not been able to ascertain whether that update
was ultimately provided to the Board.

231.1 have also reviewed a set of papers that were provided to the Post Office
Board by the ARC on 28 November 2016. In the section of those papers that

was titled “Governance and compliance” reference was made to the following:
a. Risk and governance structures are in place and being embedded.

b. The most significant risk issue remains the operational oversight by Post

Office of its branches.

Further examples of matters being escalated to Post Office’s Senior Leadership

232.1 have reviewed examples of Service Performance slide packs that were
prepared by Post Office’s then Head of IT Andrew Garner produced Service
Performance Slide packs”“® between June and September 2016. These were

sent to some members of Post Office’s Senior Leadership Team. For example:

a. The March 2016 slide pack was sent to Rob Houghton?®? in an email

dated 21 June 2016 and to Kevin Gililand, Angela Van-Den-Bogerd,

248 POL00399587

Nick Beal and Owen Woodley and others in an email dated 22 June
2016.51

b. The June 2016 slide pack was sent to_Kevin Gililand, Rob Houghton,
Nick Beal, Owen Woodley, Angela Van-Den-Bogerd, and others in an
email dated 20 July 2016.25? Some of the slides were included in a wider
presentation at a ClO Operations Board Meeting at which Rob
Houghton, Joe Arakji and others also delivered sections on 25 July
2016259

c. The September 2016 slide pack was sent to Kevin Gililand, Angela Van-
Den-Bogerd, Nick Beal, Owen Woodley and others in an email dated 19

August 2016.254

233. These slide packs analysed individual high severity incidents and tracked 7°
them against the service levels expected of Fujitsu by answering the questions
‘what happened to service performance?’, ‘what was done to improve it?', and
‘what is service performance doing now?’. They aimed to evaluate whether the
incidents were caused by known errors, propose ways that service
management could be improved based on the findings of investigations into
specific incidents, and continually track the number of incidents of different
severities. Importantly, they ostensibly considered whether Fujitsu's
performance of these service levels represented breaches of their contractual

obligations.

234. It is my understanding that Risk Logs were also produced internally within
Post Office for review and consideration by Post Office’s Cl0.2°° These Risk
Logs included dashboards which categorised, quantified, and analysed
identified IT risks and issues. These logs also included details in relation to each
individual identified risk and its severity. For example, in a log from June 2016,
the potential ineffectiveness of the failover system and the associated
degradation of the Horizon system, which was leading to instability and

increased failure rates, were flagged.?5”

External Monitoring of the extent to which Fujitsu was complying with the
relevant_contractual obligations within sections 2(a) and (b) of the Rule 9

request.

235. It is my understanding that, during the period that is the subject of question
3(b)-(d) of the Rule 9 request, Post Office would periodically commission
external reports which appear to have reported on (amongst other matters) the
extent to which Fujitsu was complying with the relevant contractual obligations.

236. A key example of such external engagement and associated reporting was
the annual commissioning of an audit?>* by Ernst and Young to ensure that the
Horizon system maintained its PCI Accreditation in relation to: ISAE 3402 —
which details the standards for control measures like monitoring, risk
assessment, performance management, system integrity and the governance
of these activities. I have referred to these audit reports and the limited

understanding that I have been able to establish regarding the associated

256 Chief Information Security Officer

258 POL00398199

Page 126 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

actions taken internally within Post Office as a result below (see paragraphs
299-364).

237.1 also understand that bi-annual reviews were scheduled to ensure that
security controls consistent with the International Standard 1S027001:2005
Code of Practice (formerly BS7799) for Information Security Management were
deployed for the Post Office Card Account?°® (POca) system.?© 261 However,
the reports were also intended to identify measures that would maximise
customer experience and service level adherence. In 2013, Post Office
commissioned Infosec to conduct this review. Infosec produced a risk action
and treatment plan which was intended to be a living document that tracked
actions against risks, provided details of compensating controls, and included
confirmation of acceptance of risk or mitigation and closure.

238. I have not been able to identify any documentation that refers to what, if any,

action was taken within Post Office as a result of this review.

REMOTE ACCESS RIGHTS

Question 2(c), 3(a) and 3(b): Regarding, “the use of access rights and privileges

by Fujitsu_employees_to_remedy errors _in_ transaction data_and_branch

accounts” (definition 2(c)), address, “the Post Office’s position on the nature

and extent of the relevant contractual duties and how they changed over time”

259 These accounts were basic bank accounts for DWP to pay government benefit payments into.

(3(a)) and “What, if any, internal or external measures were put in place to

monitor Fujitsu’s compliance with the relevant contractual obligations” (3(b))

239. There is in any large commercial IT system a requirement for provision to be
made for some technical users to have privileged access to databases. This is
necessary in order for those users to carry out system maintenance and
problem solving. The Horizon system included such facilities. The exercise of
those access rights carried obligations intended to maintain the security and
auditability of the system. Provision was therefore made that such access was
only to be afforded to qualified and specified individuals, that supervision was
in place when it was being exercised, and that it was auditable. I describe the
relevant provisions for the existence of that capability and the processes
surrounding it (see paragraphs 244-292), and for the requirements of
supervision and auditing. In doing so, I describe both the contractual obligations
set out in the Codified Agreements and CCDs and some of the relevant
processes and expectations set out in Design Documents. I then separately set
out the structures that were in place for Post Office to receive the regular reports
that Fujitsu was required to make pursuant to these provisions (see paragraphs
292-297).

240. Having reviewed this material, it is my understanding that Fujitsu were
required to monitor, document and report on their own exercise of access rights
to the extent that Post Office were dependent on Fujitsu’s assurances of its
system’s inbuilt integrity controls and auditability. It does not appear that there
was any mechanism for Post Office itself to independently assess the accuracy

of Fujitsu’s reporting about its compliance with these obligations.

Page 128 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

241. Following my review of these provisions I summarise the external reviews that
Post Office commissioned by way of periodic monitoring and review of Fujitsu’s
access rights, often as part of a wider audit of the integrity and security of Post
Office's IT systems (see paragraphs 298-364). Where relevant, I summarise
the formal steps that it appears Post Office took by way of internal response to
concerns raised about access rights within those reports.

242. I understand that the facts and opinions expressed in this part of my statement
will be of relevance to Phase 5 of the Inquiry and raise questions about historic
public representations that Post Office has made about privileges and access
rights, and about the stance that Post Office took about this during the GLO. I
make clear that I have confined my statement on these issues to the questions
posed in R9(48) and I do not attempt to anticipate or respond to any such

questions in this document.

Processes in Codified Agreements and CCDs for remedying errors in

transaction data and branch accounts

243. The contractual provisions that provided the outline obligations for affording
the accesses required to enable remote remedying of errors in transaction data
and branch accounts working within the Horizon System are set out below from
paragraph 245.

244.1 would note that whilst the question I am asked is about the remedying of
errors in “transaction data and branch accounts” I have included in my review
contractual provisions and documents that relate to the power to alter ‘data’,
even where it may be that the text refers to ‘data’ generally, and therefore may

relate to broader category than specifically ‘transaction data’ or ‘branch

Page 129 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

accounts’. That is because, particularly in respect of CCDs, policy, manuals and
service descriptions, the documents have tended to describe facets of Horizon
and its interfacing systems often do not distinguish between specific sub-
categories of data within that system. As a result, where documents include
references to forms of remote access to data or the correcting of data, it is not
always clear to the reader whether or not those references are inclusive of
transaction data specifically or are referring to that relevant part of the Horizon
system. I also understand that the Inquiry is interested in whether access rights
to data may have been misused, or used more widely than intended. I have
therefore taken an inclusive approach rather than run the risk of erroneously

excluding relevant provisions.
Codified Agreement
245. Original Codified Agreement

a. Schedule A15 Clause 3.3.4.3 stated that the Transaction Management
Service (“TMS?**) shall provide links into client systems operated on
behalf of clients as required to support POCL.

b. Schedule A2 Clause 4.16 stated that “The confidentiality, integrity,
availability, and completeness of data shall be maintained throughout all
storage, processes, and transmissions, including during periods of
Service Failure and recovery from Service Failure.”

c. Schedule A16 Reference Number 812 stated that:

d. Schedule A16 Reference Number 827 stated that the Pathway solution
could support links to external computer systems. Such links were
already in existence and were achieved through the use of a service
specific TMS agent.264

e. Schedule A16 Reference Number 800 detailed one of the processes
for remedying an erroneous transaction. It stated that corrections to a
transaction within the current customer session would normally involve
a simple modification applied directly to the transaction, in which the
original transaction would be reversed and the correct transaction would
be inserted.

f. Schedule A16 Reference Number 804 stated that that ‘a Joss or gain

transaction may need to be generated to account for any cash (or other

These were used to identify reconciliation exceptions for investigation
and corrective action.

d. Schedule 18 Clause 2.9.1 stated that the Reconciliation facilities are
composed of various tools that reconcile the data generated between

b. Schedule B4.2 Clause 121.9.1 stated that the Horizon Reconciliation
Facilities comprise a set of applications which will support Post Office in
effecting reconciliation between itself, its clients and third parties. These
facilities will also support the reconciliation of accounting transaction
data processed at a Counter Position with the details passed to the Post
Office.

c. Schedule B4.4 Clause 134.4.5.2 stated that the interfaces between the
Data Centres and Post Office or Client systems shall support real and

delayed time initiation of activities.

249. Further and more detailed provision for the capability and perceived need for
privileged access for the remedying of errors in transaction data and branch
accounts was made through CCDs, policy and design documents, which I have
detailed below.

250. By way of example, the ‘Access Control Policy’ stated that remedial action
would be required as part of the monitoring of the system by Security
Management and Operational Management, and that ‘human’ intervention

would only be required in “exceptional circumstances” and usually as a

response to Incidents.7°? For example, SSC would generate flat files of
transaction adjustments that would then be transmitted into data centres.
Version 4 of the document, issued in July 2002, stated that auditors may also
require access.?’°

251. The ‘Reconciliation Service: Service Description’ explained that Fujitsu would
provide a ‘Reconciliation Service’ to ensure financial integrity access all
transactions in HNG-X.2’" It provided for a mechanism in which the
Reconciliation Service would raise a ‘BIM Report’ (Business Incident
Management Report). The BIM Report was to contain the details of the repaired
transaction file or files (if a single BIM required multiple amendments)?” When
making these changes, the Reconciliation Service were permitted to make
corrective assumptions concerning the data based on previous patterns or
types of data and communicated to Post Office.?’° 2”4 However, from December
2013 onwards, Version 4 of the document stipulated that the Reconciliation
Service was required to seek permission from Post Office before inserting
corrective transactions to address inconsistent records.2”°

252. There is a difference between Version 1 of the document dated 24 August
2006 and Version 4 of the document dated 3 December 2013.

253. Version 1 which provides at §2.1.4.17:
“If the Reconciliation Service identifies that any Transaction data held on the

‘central database’ located at the. Data Centra is found to be inconsistent

sentence instead reads, “... prior to the insertion of corrective transactions.”

255. This process was discontinued on 3 June 2020.?”8

256. The ‘HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture’ CCD was in place
throughout HNG-X's rollout, from Version 2 released on 8 January 20092’ to
Version 4 released on 24 September 2020.”°° This is summarised again below
in respect of how access rights were exercised, but it provided that there would
be a connection between the Fujitsu Corporate network and the Horizon-Online
infrastructure which would be used for “support and reporting purposes.”

257. The ‘Customer Services Support Services Manual’ issued on 7 November
2000 stated that there were only two reasons for accessing the live system

which were:2"

a. Assisting in diagnosis of problems on the live system; and
b. Correcting data which has become corrupted subject to an Operational

Correction Request which was required for this action.

258. The ‘Operations Manual for the Customer Services Directorate,’ which
was released on 24 August 2006, provided that access to the live system to
correct data would only be permitted when data had become corrupted and
only if an Operational Correction Request was submitted. *°2285 These were
Fujitsu generated documents circulated to Post Office apparently for
information only.
259. Version 2 of the Policy, released on 24 February 1998, stated that individuals’
roles had specific permissions associated with them. This was known as ‘Role
Based Access.’ 7*4 The system was intended to perform a check on whether
the action an individual was attempting was compatible with their
permissions.”®° It was intended that only some individuals had permission to
use the tools that could impact branch accounts such as Tivoli and Oracle.
260. Role Based Access also extended into which areas of the system an
individual could access. For example, Post Office Systems and Branch
Systems were segmented, and only people with the appropriate level of
seniority could access them.?®” In order to access the system, there was an
authentication procedure.7°° Systems or tools capable of more significant
impact required further authentication.

261. It is my understanding that, in the case of management roles associated with
management tasks like remotely accessing branch accounts, a physical token

was required.2®° Administrative and ‘super-user’ access required two-factor
authentication.2° Access to the live environment required a high level of
seniority and therefore a high level of authentication.

262. The ‘Community Information Security Policy for Horizon’ was first issued
on 8 June 2005.29" It was a CCD which required Fujitsu to cooperate with Post
Office and assist Post Office in complying with the standard set out in the policy,
and to operate in accordance with ISO/IEC 17799:2000, Information Security
Management: Code of Practice for Information Security Management as a
baseline, together with other approved technical and procedural standards
where appropriate. There was no specific requirement to undertake certification
to ISO/IEC 17799:2000 but it was the domain suppliers' responsibility to identify
and comply with the relevant standards. Successive versions of the document

referred to the prevailing ISO standards. The Policy required that,

“Access to Horizon information processing facilities must be controlled. There
must be a demonstrable need for third party access. A risk assessment must
be carried out to determine the security implications and control requirements

for any forms of physical and electronic access by third parties.”

263. The ‘Horizon Security Policy’, released on 24 February 2006, referred to the
principles of the Security Architecture and Access Control Policy. It stated that
a written request was necessary to gain access to systems and networks. This

would be approved by the duty or owner of the business unit and retained

according to internal standards.?% It required Fujitsu to maintain lists of
individuals and their specific access rights by System Administrators who
ensured that these reflected the principles in the Access Control Policy.?°°
264. The ‘Security Management Service -— Service Description’ refined this
process in 2008 to specify that the individuals with Remote Access Rights —
including TES-QA users, global users, and Audit and Engineer users — should
be limited and stringently documented.? It stipulated that appropriate security
measures should be applied to all remote access to Post Office systems, stating

that:

“All remote access to Post Office Account systems, applications and data, i
rrespective of access route, must be restricted to authorised users, and only
to services, applications files or data for which those users are authorised.
Such remote access must require verification and authentication of UserlDs,
passwords, tokens, biometrics and where possible location details before

connection is allowed.”

265. It provided that active monitoring was to take place to ensure that no
unauthorised or abusive access was occurring.2°° Periodic Checks were
required to take place to identify inactive accounts and any user who changed
roles or accounts was to be removed immediately.*°° The summary of these

roles and the access permissions are contained in Appendix A of the Policy.

266. It is my understanding that across the period that is the subject of question 3
of the rule 9 request, those who had sufficient power to remotely access the
live environment included: application Support Managers;?9’ Fraud Risk
Managers (although only in pursuit of resolving fraud);*9° Business Function
Auditors;?°° Security Event Auditors;*°° System Management;°°' SSC Support
Managers;°°2 SSC Support users;°°? non-dedicated Fujitsu Support Staff.°%

267. The ‘Post Office Account User Access Procedure’ was a Fujitsu document
intended to establish the controls that applied to user access in order for Fujitsu
to fulfil its contractual requirements to Post Office in this respect, for example
version 4 of the document dated 18 October 2011 provided that “only
authorised individuals have access to the assets that their role requires” and
“the access provided is managed, monitored, reviewed and controlled”.5°°

268. The ‘HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture’ set out the principles that
the Security team operated under. It appears this sought to apply to the
principle of ‘Least Privilege’ access, which was defined as “that which is not
explicitly granted is denied” or a “default deny” stance which granted only the
permissions necessary to carry out the action being performed.°°° This was
echoed in the Counter Architecture design document.°”

269. The ‘Remote Support Secure Access Server High Level Design’ was a
design document for the remote access server released on 24 October 2016.

It appears to have echoed the principle of tightly controlled access and

authentication, stating that:

“HNG-X users shall not have any access to add, modify, delete or execute
any operating system or application files without first being properly
authorised, authenticated and audited. Controls shall be in place to prevent
this requirement being bypassed by any new or upgraded application or

system build.”2°8

270.1 have also had sight of the ‘Systems Support Centre (SSC) Operations
Manuals’ ,°° first released on 7 November 2000. Having reviewed these, it is
my understanding that they show that the SSC had access to the live estate to
correct data on the system when it had been corrupted in some way.°'°

271.1 have also reviewed the ‘End to End application Support Strategy’ release
in July 2011 and which refined the role of the Support Services. This stated
that; “Direct access to live Post Office counters is currently only available to the
SSC’ and “depends on access to the SSN servers and the use of a passphrase

which allows public key authentication to a fixed user on the counter” .>"

Conditions_under which individuals could exercise access rights to remedy

errors in transaction data and branch accounts

272. The Codified Agreement contained some provisions which had the effect of

requiring:
a. authorisation; and
b. maintenance of records of access rights being used to remedy errors in

transaction data and branch accounts.

273. It is my understanding that these obliged Fujitsu to maintain an audit trail that
accurately recorded the details of amendments, remedies or new transactions.
It is my understanding that these were further clarified in CCDs, particularly the
‘Audit Trail Functional Specification’, to which the Codified Agreement cross-

referred in every iteration.

Codified Agreement

274. Original Codified Agreement

a. Schedule A16 Reference Number 804 stated that process of inserting
the loss or gain transaction which negates and amends the original
erroneous transaction must be carried out by the office manager within
the office administration function.

b. Schedule F01 Clause 4.4.1 stated that all transactions and actions
undertaken in EPOSS shall be recorded in an audit trail by use of, and

maintained by, the POCL Infrastructure Services.

c. Schedule G01 Clause 2.6.1.1. stated that full logs of transactions and
significant events within OPS shall be maintained and an audit trail of
interactions with, and actions within, OPS shall be maintained.

d. Schedule G01 Clause 2.6.1.2 stated that all data captured at an outlet
either as part of a Counter Position Transaction or as an administration
function shall form part of a unique transaction which shall be given a
unique reference number by Riposte and details stored in the journal.
The format of this journal entry shall vary according to the Transaction
type but will typically contain: Post Office ID; Counter Position ID; Unique
Transaction ID; Date; Time; User ID; Application; Transaction Details.

e. Schedule G01 Clause 2.6.1.4. stated that once data are stored in the
journal, they shall never be altered and that new transactions should
always be appended to the journal.

i Schedule G01 Clause 3.2.2 stated that the role of TMS shall be to
provide a secure and resilient messaging and journalling service which
shall support the transfer of data between OPS and POCL Client
services, and the POCL Services.

g. Schedule G01 Clause 3.4.7.1. stated that Fujitsu should maintain a full

audit trail of all TMS activity.

275. 2002_ Agreement

a. Schedule 17 Clause 6.6.1.1 stated that all data captured at a Branch
either as part of a Transaction performed at a Counter Position or as an
administration function shall form part of a unique Transaction which

shall be given a unique reference number by Riposte and details stored

Page 143 of 255
WITNO3680200

in the message store. The format of this message store entry shall vary
according to the Transaction type but will typically contain: Post Office
ID; Counter Position ID; unique Transaction ID; date; time; User ID;
Application; and Transaction details.

b. Schedule 17 Clause 6.6.1.3 stated that Once data are stored in the
message store they should never be altered. New Transactions should
always be appended to the message store.

(om Schedule 17 Clause 7.2.2 states that the role of TMS shall be to provide
a secure and resilient messaging and journalling service which shall
support the transfer of data between OPS and Post Office Client
Services, and Post Office Services.

d. Schedule 18 Clause, 2.8.2 stated that the Audit facilities enable the
recording of an operational audit trail and a commercial audit trail°'? as
such terms are referred to in the CCD entitled “Audit Trail Functional

Specification” (CR/FSP/006).
276. Current Contract, Version 1 (2006)

a. Schedule B3.2 Clause 32.9.1 and Schedule E Clause 107.1 stated
that the Audit Support Facility enables the recording of an operational
audit trail and a commercial audit trail as defined in the CCD entitled
“Audit Trail Functional Specification" (CR/FSP/006)

b. Schedule B4.4 Clause 62.2.2 states that the role of TMS shall be to

provide a secure and resilient messaging and journalling service which

312 These are, respectively, the audit trail associated with the operation of the services which make up
the Horizon solution and the audit trail associated with that part of Post Office Account’s internal
commercial records to which Post Office Ltd's Internal Auditors or Agents may have access.

Page 144 of 255

shall support the transfer of data between OPS and Post Office Client
Services, and Post Office Services.

c. Schedule B5 Clause 8 states that Reconciliation Facilities are provided
by the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities.

d. Schedule B5 Clause 8 states that Reconciliation Facilities are provided

by the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities.

277. Current Contract Version 11 (2016)

a. Schedule B5 Clause 1.1.1 states that the role of TMS shall be to provide
a secure and resilient messaging and journalling service which shall
support the transfer of data between OPS and the HNG-X Service
Infrastructure.

b. Schedule D1 Clause 90.1 and Schedule B3.2 108..9.1 and Schedule
B5 Annex 2 Clause 7.1 and 7.2 stated that the Business Capabilities
and Support Facilities provided by Fujitsu Services relating to the audit
trail of transactions undertaken in branches are provided for in Schedule
B3.2 and the provisions dealing with the operational audit trail set out in

the CCD entitled “Audit Trail Functional Specification” (CR/FSP/006).
CCDs

278. The ‘Access Control Policy’ stated that the changes that could be made by
some individuals were subject to controlled conditions and authorisation
procedures.5'° In Version 1 of the Policy, released in April 1997, it was stated

that the operational management of the machine facilitating the remote access

313 POL00400776

Page 145 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

would confirm the need for access.°'4 Similarly, Version 2 of the Access
Control Policy released on 16 July 2002, stated that updates to code or data by
support staff was to audited.>"5

279. The ‘Audit Trail Functional Specification’ set out Fujitsu’s obligations to
maintain and provide access to audit trails. Version 3 released on 1 July

1999°"® provided that:

“1.1.1. The operational audit trail includes that generated by the
mainstream operational services and the Reconciliation Exceptions
Database (RED)... The RED provides an auxiliary audit trail which
separately covers the treatment of exceptions encountered within the

mainstream operational services.”

"3.1.1 RED is free-standing from the mainstream Pathway Solution. It is
a record of the activities undertaken by the Pathway Customer Service
Business Support Unit to make necessary adjustments to

transactions, typically to effect accurate reconciliations."

280. It is my understanding that this meant that reconciliation exceptions — for
example, transaction corrections — should have been separately captured
within the audit trails provided for. In a subsequent version of this document

released on 15 October 2001, the term ‘RED’ had changed to ‘BIMS’.3'7

281. The SSC ‘Operations Manual’ set out expectations for the processes that
individuals were to follow for “every change to the live system.”*'® This was
echoed in the Operations Manual for the Customer Services Directorate *'°
The procedure required a Duty Manager, Problem Manager, Business Support
manager or SSC Staff Member to complete an Operational Correction Request
Form, which would document the affected part of the system. The process
required that changes to the live system should only be made in the presence
of two people. The OCR form required to be signed, sequentially, by the
individual who made the change and the two people who witnessed them
making it. I note that in Version 4 of the Document, released on 16 July 2002,
the requirement to submit an Operational Correction Request seems to no
longer apply, although two staff members were still required to be present. 22°
The Operations Manual also repeated provisions set out elsewhere in respect

of security policy, as it stated;

“Security policy mandates that all users requiring access to the live system
have to be approved by CS Security. This is a fundamental security access
control requirement. The procedure involves the completion of an application
form, which is authorised by the individual's Business Unit Manager. This is
forwarded to CS Security who validates the request and sends to ISD

Operations via the ISD mailbox for activation on the system.”>"

282. Version 7 of the ‘Access Control Policy’ dated 14 April 2005 stated:

a. “Note that no application support users have access to Post Office
counter systems except as allowed for in 4.5.5.2 below.
b. 4.5.5.2 SSC access to the counter estate via SSH and may download

data from the Data Centres to an appropriate test rig where this is
required to assist in diagnosing application problems and testing new
software to fix the problem.

c. 4.5.5.3 Support users should have only read access to the supported
systems, except for: SSC support managers (not normal SSC support
users) “correcting” data under controlled conditions. (Data may need to
be corrected where it has been corrupted by faulty code.) Correction of
data must be subject to agreed authorisation procedures.

d. 4.5.5.4 In all cases, updates to code or data by application support staff
require two staff to be present when the change is made and all such
changes to be audited, identifying what has been changed (before and

after values) and the individual who made the change.” **

283. The ‘Horizon Security Policy’ released on 24 February 2006 provided that
Line Managers must have implemented a formal process for requesting,
authorising, granting, reviewing and revoking access rights to Post Office
Account business information, systems and networks. Business Managers

were also subject to this responsibility.°?° The policy provided that:

“Security audit trails are required to provide traceable evidence of all activities
affecting information system, application and network resources. This must

include both transaction and system audits. The audit trail must include all

322 POL00400790, p.39-40
323 POL00401642

Page 148 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

violations and exceptional events as required by both the owner and audit
functions. The audit logs must be retains for a minimum period commensurate

with the requirements of the system or any regulatory authorities."°*4

284. Several design documents also emphasised that the maintenance of audit
logs was a condition of the exercise of accesses to remedy errors in transaction
data and branch accounts. For example, the ‘Security Architecture’
documents stated: “all actions performed on the system will be recorded to
establish an audit trail’ and specifically stated that ‘super-user’ access was to
be audited.°*° They specified that the person who made a specific change was
meant to be identifiable.°*° In Version 6 of the document, released on 12 July
2017, a PEAK reference was required to be part of the audit trail which would
have ensured that the action could be tied to a specific Incident or Problem.°2”

285. The ‘End to End Application Support Strategy’ released on 28 July 2011,
stated that the teams that had the ability to change data like the SSC were

prohibited from also editing the audit trail. The document went onto state that: 22°

“The audit servers provide a full audit trail of all information on the HNGX
system. In order to ensure that this audit trail is irrefutable the teams which
have the ability to change data (i.e. SSC) must not also have the ability to
change the audit trail. For this reason, Audit server 3rd line support rests with

the Audit development team and not the SSC.”°?°

286. I have reviewed a number of documents, from which my understanding is that,
from 2008, the stringency of the requirements that access to the live system be
auditable was reduced.

287. I noted firstly that the ‘Remote Support Secure Access Server High Level
Design’ Version 2 issued on 13 May 2008 re-drafted a clause about audit, so

that it read as follows:

“Although no active command logging or keystroke logging is done but we are
keeping the record of people logged on to SAS (SSN) server through double
authentication and OS security policies for state servers. Security policy is

implemented to raise alert when any file is copied or deleted to SAS (SSN)
server. Also no user account is allowed to install any software on SAS (SSN).

FTP folder will be maintained manually by SSC team.”5°°

288. Version 1 of the same document, issued on 10 January 2008, stated that; “A//
access through the Secure Access Server should be audited. A command
logging service will be provided to create audit logs of all support sessions.”**"
My understanding is that this preserved the need for auditing of which users
accessed records of branch transactions but it meant that there would not be
auditable records of what those users did. My understanding is that this design
document is the origin of the documents that became known as the ‘Privileged
User Access’ logs (or ‘PAU logs’).

289. Version 2 of ‘HNG-X Architecture: Security Architecture’ ,°°? issued on 8

January 2009, stated, in Paragraph 5.1.1 that: "All access to the SAS Server is

30 POL00396665, clause 3.1.2
331 POL00395680, clause 4.1.2
382 POL00397112

Page 150 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

audited though command line auditing of SSH sessions has been removed."
This differs from Version 1°°°, issued on 16 February 2007, which stated at
Paragraph 5.8.3 that "Auditing is turned on including command line auditing for
Super-user access via SSH."

290. The difference between the two versions seems to me to be potentially
significant because SSH facilitated the secure link between the SSC and the
counter infrastructure. The command line was the means through which
changes could be made to transaction records. My understanding has been
reinforced by Version 2 of the ‘Remote Support Secure Access Server High
Level Design’ (in effect when Version 2 of the Security Architecture CCD was
issued) which states that the SSH server "will provide a secure link for support
access"*** and identified®®° as a risk that the command line auditing had not
been developed in time for the release of the HNG-X System.

291. It is my understanding that at the same time there was recognition within the
SSC that the tools in place for making balancing transactions were powerful
and not without risk. The Fujitsu document ‘Branch Database High Level
Design’, Version 1 of which was issued on 17 November 2009,°°° described

the Balancing Transaction tool BRDBX015 as follows:

a. “There is a requirement that the SSC will have ability to insert balancing
transactions into the persistent objects of the Branch Database. There

are reasons for SSC having to do so e.g. to rectify erroneous accounting

data that may have been logged as a result of a bug in the Counter /
BAL.

b. Any writes by the SSC to BRDB must be audited. The mechanism for
inserting a correction record must ensure that the auditing of that action
performed must be atomic. There also needs a level of obfuscation to
ensure that the audit mechanism is robust.

c. The above-mentioned requirements suggest that there is a need for a
correction tool to be delivered which performs the correction, audits it
and saves both changes.

d. A simple low-cost solution for the tool is to provide a Linux shell based
utility, which calls a PL/SQL package to perform the changes. The
package will allow inserts to the following transactional tables in the
Branch Database Live schema with the exception of the Message
Journal. All inserts will be audited in the table
BRDB_TXN_CORR_TOOL_JOURNAL.”*37

“7.2.12.6 PROCESSING DETAILS

e. Warning: The use of this powerful tool has inherent risks. If the SQL
statement is incorrect or badly written, it is possible to cause unintended
consequences, some of which may cause serious problems to the
Branch Database. It is expected that only a small number of skilled staff
will run this tool and that they will have detailed guidance as to when and
how to use the tool.

f. The correction tool places a number of constraints on the contents of the

transaction file. These are necessary in order to provide a defined

baseline upon which it can base its operation. If any of the constraints
are violated then validation will detect it and abort the run with a

meaningful error message.”*°>

Regular mechanisms of monitoring

292. It is my understanding that monitoring the usage of access rights was
therefore intended to be a key part of the security architecture. Throughout the
relevant period, the function of monitoring Fujitsu's operational-level access to
the system was outsourced to Fujitsu's security team, who would in turn report
to Post Office. Post Office treated the Fujitsu security team as independent of,
and able to monitor, the Fujitsu SSC employees. I understand from discussions
with colleagues that, at the time, it was viewed as an unremarkable aspect of
the ‘software as a service’ model, and this is consistent with my own knowledge
and experience of working within the IT community during the same period. It
meant that, in effect, Post Office was dependent on Fujitsu for the provision of
information about the extent to which Fujitsu was complying with its contractual
obligations around privileged access rights, including the auditing and
supervision thereof.

293. The service that Post Office commissioned from Fujitsu in respect of the
security for the Horizon system was set out in the CCD ‘Security Management
Service: Service Description’®*°, Version 5 of which was issued on 4 April
2014. Versions*° of this document provided, among other things, that Fujitsu

should liaise with Post Office in accordance with the CCD ‘Post Office HNG-X

Account Information Security Policy,’ run monthly internal Information
Security Management Reviews (ISMR) providing agreed monthly reports; and
attend monthly customer ISMF meetings, providing agreed monthly reports.

294. A Management Assertion from February 2013°*" (contained within Fujitsu's
description of the IT infrastructure services supporting Post Office 's POLSAP
and HNG-X applications throughout the period 1 April 2012 to 31 December
2012), stated that: "Controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that remote
access is appropriately restricted to authorised personnel."

295. In November 2013, a meeting took place between the Post Office Information
Security and Assurance Group (ISAG) and Fujitsu, the minutes*4? of which

record that it was intended:

"To record and review any changes to privileged user access on a monthly
basis and to undertake a full review twice a year. It was previously agreed
that a User review would be undertaken at this meeting. However the

information was not made available at the time of this meeting."

296. Fujitsu's Management Assertion from February 2014%° (contained within
Fujitsu's description of the IT infrastructure services supporting Post Office's
POLSAP and HNG-X applications throughout the period 1 April 2013 to 31
December 2013), repeated the previous year's statement that; "Controls exist
to provide reasonable assurance that remote access is appropriately restricted

to authorised personnel."

297.1 have reviewed an e-mail from February 2014 from Alastair Kay at Fujitsu to
Kathryn Alexander at Post Office concerning access to information and branch
logs, in which Mr Kay stated that; "The data from the branches are saved on
the Central dbase. Therefore Support are the only team who have read access

to the data for Logs etc."*44

Internal and external mechanisms of monitoring — audits and reports

298. The management summary of an audit of the Horizon Data Centres and
Belfast Operations by ICL Pathway in 2001%45 found (amongst other things)

that:

"Non-approved tools are being used to remotely administer the live estate
resulting in an inability to audit individual user activity as is required by agreed
policy. Alternative options are already being considered by Pathway to
address this issue. User account administration should be reviewed and
enforced to obviate the need to by-pass approved account policies by using

Administrator privilege."

299. Ernst & Young LLP (‘EY’) then prepared an Audit Report in respect of Royal
Mail for the year ended 30 March 2008. That report included the following
comments in relation to Royal Mail’s IT processes and the robustness of its IT

infrastructure:

a. “Following the challenges experienced in performing our IT audit in prior

years, the audit process was greatly improved ... as the ownership within

34 POL00401632
45 POL00394026

Page 155 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

the Group IT function for managing third party suppliers and delivery of
audit information requests becomes clearer as individuals are more
accountable.

b. “The most significant finding related to the SAP system. Whilst we are
Satisfied that the mechanism for granting access rights to Royal Mail
employees is appropriate, we identified 61 third party programmers at
the year end [sic] (and a further 76 during the year) who had unlimited
access to the Group’s SAP systems as a result of having the all powerful
[sic] ‘SAP-ALL’ profile for which there was no audit log or other such
mechanism to monitor the use of this access”.

c. “In our experience, where IT systems and processes are outsourced, it
is not unusual for third parties to have super access to an organisations
systems in order to discharge their contractual responsibilities. However,
the number of individuals with these rights are usually relatively few and
they are known to the company. Where it is necessary to provide this
level of access rights to additional contractors, authorisation is required

for the company prior to execution by the supplier’.

300. The Audit report identified two specific examples of third-party access
including the following comment in relation to POL-MI, MDR / FRS: “A limited
set of users have access to manipulate data as it is loaded into these
databases. Our extended procedures were designed to address the risks

arising from this and the ineffective change control issue for SAP-ADS.

Page 156 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

This extended testing also represented our alternate approach to
Horizon.’*46
301. It is my understanding that the Royal Mail Holdings Audit and Risk
Committee meeting in March 2008 was informed of a presentation to the Royal
Mail Holdings Board in which it was explained that the IT capabilities of Royal
Mail were “inadequate for the current and future environment".*4” Concerns
appear to have included those relating to system access. The Committee
decided the IT control environment should be a regular item at future Audit and
Risk Committee meetings so that the Committee could be updated on progress.
302. The Royal Mail Holdings’ Audit and Risk Committee meeting of May 2008
summarised EY's findings as follows: "Following the challenges experienced in
performing the IT audit in prior years, the audit process was greatly improved,
as the ownership for managing third party suppliers and delivery of audit
information was much clearer and individuals were more accountable. The
most significant finding had been the unlimited access to the SAP system by
third party programmers. The findings were consistent with the broad themes
and challenges in relation to the Group's IT environment presented to an earlier
meeting of the Committee."*4®
303. The Committee concluded it could not reach firm conclusions about the
control environment until the IT strategy had been developed further and it
requested an update at the Audit and Risk Committee meeting in September

2008.

304. It is my understanding that a presentation was prepared for the September
2008 meeting which identified access control as a critical point of focus. The
steps taken to address this weakness were described as disk encryption and
firewalls.*4° The minutes state a further update would be provided in March
2009 but, pursuant to the searches that have been carried out for documents
to assist me in responding to the rule 9 request, I have not been able to find
any minutes from that month.

305. In May 2010, EY reported: "Whilst some improvements were noted in the POL
IT audit process, we continue to face difficulties in obtaining accurate
information from Fujitsu, one of the outsourced providers of POL IT systems."*°°

306. In was further stated by EY that; "POL has made significant changes to its IT
environment in 2010, resulting in the inclusion in scope of the Credence
application for the first time, replacing POL-MI and the Reference Data System.
During 2010, POL also worked with Fujitsu to deliver a new version of the
Horizon application used at, and in support of, Post Office branches. This new
version of Horizon was also included in scope."*>"

307. EY also referred to difficulties in performing IT general control procedures with
Fujitsu in 2009 and noted these difficulties continued, reporting that; "While the
controls operated by Fujitsu on behalf of Post Office were appropriately
designed an exception was noted in the revocation of user access. Access was

immediately revoked by Fujitsu when this was identified."°5?

308. As part of the Royal Mail Holdings plc audit conducted by EY,° a
Management Letter for the year ended 27 March 2011 was prepared which

said as follows:

a. “In POL, our audit identified significant IT control weaknesses, which in
our view reflects a need for improvement by the outsource provider
Fujitsu but also a change in approach on the part of POL. However, we
ultimately obtained mitigating audit evidence to rely on the IT control
environment.”

b. “... there is no one Fujitsu or POL person who has full knowledge of
POL’s end-to-end processes or access to documentation and other
evidence to support the operation of key controls which result in certain
information which we could consider routine not being available”.

c. “The main area we would encourage management focus on in the
current year is improving the IT governance and control environment.
Within the IT environment our audit work has again identified
weaknesses mainly relating to the control environment operated by
POL’s third party IT suppliers. Our key recommendations can be

summarised into the following four areas:

i. Improve governance of outsourcing application management;
ii. Improve segregation of duties within the manage change
process;

iii. Strengthen the change management process; and

53 POL00030217

Page 159 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

7 Strengthen the review of privileged access.” °°4

309. The report noted that “the recommendations we have made in this report
should be seen as refinements rather than fundamental control deficiencies in
comparison.”355

310. Section 3 of the report, which concerned strengthening the change
management process, which had been deemed by EY to be a high priority area,
included a review of and raised concerns in respect of privileged access to IT
functions.

311. The first of these concerns was; “We reviewed privileged access to IT
functions including access to user administration functionality across all in-
scope applications and their supporting infrastructure. Our examination
revealed:

312. The second was; [...] HNGX - There are inappropriate system privileges
assigned to the APPSUP role and SYSTEM_MANAGER role at the Oracle
database level on the Branch Database server (BDB) supporting HNGX;

313. The third was; [...] System privileges assigned to the APPSUP role and
OPSS$TPS account are inappropriate °°

314. The fourth was; “Unrestricted access to privileged IT functions increases the
risk of unauthorised/inappropriate access which may lead to the processing of

unauthorised or erroneous transactions” °°"

57 POL00030217, p.34

Page 160 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

315. The fifth was; “There are no monitoring controls in place for privileged IT
access to HNGX.”$®

316. The 2011 Management Letter included a number of recommendations for
Post Office in relation to privileged access including that “management
conducts a review of privileged access to IT functions across all in-scope
applications and their supporting infrastructure to determine whether the level
of privileged access granted is appropriate” and, “Management should consider
the implementation of a POL owned periodic review of appropriateness of
access to in-scope applications and their supporting infrastructure” and, “The
above review should include all user accounts including those privileged user
accounts owned by IT and vendors.”

317. Post Office “Management Comment’ in the 2011 Management Letter noted
that “work has commenced on the strengthening of the change management
process” and noted a number of future steps to be taken including “POL to
review the current BAU governance to ensure the change management
principles are being applied and monitored” and “reporting and evidence to be
agreed regarding BAU reports of Privileged Access abuse to provide POL with
the assurances they require.” “Fujitsu senior management ... to review rights
of their staff and their appropriateness every quarter. Quarterly BAU Assurance
reports to POL concerning reviews that have occurred across the account will
be governed by the Audit Control Governance Board.” There are no harmful
events in relation to change management and permissions noted in the 2011
management letter nor is there an instance of irregular or unauthorised remote

access recorded.

WITN03680200

318. EY prepared their Audit Results Report for the year ended 27 March 2011
for Royal Mail Holdings Plc in May 2011.°°° That report made a number of
observations in relation to IT control weaknesses, noting that (amongst other

matters) in so far as POL-SAP was concerned there were:

a. "Accounts with access to both develop and deploy changes to the live
environment";

b. There was: "Access to deploy changes for inappropriate
individuals/leavers" .

c. There were “multiple generic accounts with highly powerful privileges.”

d. There was a “lack of periodic review of appropriateness of user access.”

319. In relation to HNG-X, additional concerns were raised, which included the

following:

a. There were “developers with access to migrate changes to the live
environment.”
b. “Leavers with access to promote changes to the live environment not

being removed.”

G There was evidence of “/ack of periodic review of appropriateness of
user access.”
d. There was evidence of “passwords for privileged generic accounts being

shared with multiple users.”

320. In response, it is my understanding that there was a de-brief session between

Post Office and Fujitsu regarding the “difficulties faced during the audit.” Lesley

9 POL00030217, p.36

Page 162 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Sewell engaged “...with the Fujitsu account leader to highlight Post Office’s

desire to implement a required controls framework and explore options for the

conduct of the audit in future”. From these discussions, Post Office understood
that “...Fujitsu has accepted that control improvements are required and has
initiated a project to address the security issues.” What were described as

“high-level action plans” were agreed by Fujitsu, Post Office and EY to improve

the audit process for the following year.°°° Post Office established an audit

steering group to implement EY's recommendations.*°"

321. It is my understanding that, in September 2011, a ‘Post Office Board Paper
- POL IT Audit Update,’ presented by the then Chief Operating Officer,
explained that an Audit Steering Group had been established for IT related
audits which he said provided the appropriate level of governance and oversight
to ensure that the audit actions were completed as agreed and the alignment
of all Post Office’s compliance audit requirements. The paper explained that a
project team had been established within Fujitsu to manage all activities which
were on target for completion by end of October, within which Fujitsu had
completed two of the recommendations, namely strengthening the change
management process and improving the problem and incident management
process. He reported that, in light of the finding that in respect of the level of
oversight and assurance of control processes within Fujitsu, Post Office were
“working with Fujitsu to build a reporting process to ensure visibility of Fujitsu’s
control environment is transparent to POL through regular reporting activity.”

He noted that five of the recommendations relate to user management and

360 POL00238126
61 POL00029438

Page 163 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

access rights to Post Office’s systems, and said, “A complete review of this area
is underway and is on target for completion”. He said Post Office were working
on three actions independently of Fujitsu, which refer to improved user
management controls within the Post Office finance system for cash services,
a review of the testing process for maintenance / business as usual (“BAU”)
changes (to ensure that a consistent approach exists and is followed, with
regular audit to monitor compliance) and the creation of a central store of
approvals.

322. I have also had sight of email correspondence between Neil Lecky Thompson
(Head of Programmes and Planning, Post Office) to Lesley Sewell and Sarah
Hall dated 21 March 2012 which contained a summary of Post Office’s internal
views of the issues raised in the audit and made reference to a lessons-learned
exercise being conducted.

323.In the summary described above, some recommended management
responses to findings made in the report. However, I have not been able to
establish the extent to which these findings were ultimately implemented. They

were as follows:

Finding Recommended Management response

324. Shortly thereafter, on 23 March 2012, Post Office's Internal Audit and Risk
Management Report, which was entitled “Internal Audit & Risk Management:
Review of Key Systems Controls in Horizon” was circulated internally.*°° In that

report, it was stated;

a. “Unrestricted access to privileged IT functions increases the risk of
unauthorised/inappropriate activities which may lead to the processing
of unauthorised or erroneous transactions.”

b. “We recommend that management conducts a review of privileged
access to IT functions across the in-scope applications and their
supporting infrastructure to determine whether the level of privileged
access granted is appropriate. Where access is deemed to be

inappropriate, this access should be revoked immediately.”

325. In May 2012, the 2012 EY Audit Report stated that: "In conjunction with our
IT specialists, we have assessed the manage change and logical access IT
controls to be ineffective, which was the same conclusion we reached in the
prior year. However, through additional compensating testing we have been
able to rely on the IT systems supporting the POL financial statements."°®4

326. A presentation to the Risk and Compliance Management Committee on 14
May 2012°°5 stated (amongst other matters) the following in relation to

privileged user access:

363 POL00142948. The report is noted as having been circulated to the following individuals: Susan
Crichton, Legal and Compliance Director, Christopher Day, Finance Director, Kevin Gilliland, Network
and Sales Director, Dave M King, Senior Security Programme Manager, Neil Lecky-Thompson, Head
of Programmes and Planning, John Scott, Head of Security, Lesley Sewell, Head of IT and Change,

327. It is my understanding that a final draft of the “E & Y Post Office Limited:
Control themes and observations for Year ended 25 March 2012”°°°
contained a number of recommendations, to which Post Office Management
responded. The recommendations were that Post Office Management should

(i) conduct a review of privileged access of IT functions to determine whether

366 POL00143524 (covering email from Sarah Hall (Financial Controller, Post Office) to Rod Ismay and
Lesley Sewell) and POL00143525 being the report itself.

Page 167 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

the level of access is appropriate; and (ii) where access is deemed to be
inappropriate, this access should be revoked immediately. It was also stated
that “Management should implement monitoring controls to help ensure that
controls operated by the third party service providers are in place and are in
operation, for example, monitoring of appropriateness of access to privileged
users/profiles.”

328. In response, Post Office is recorded as having stated, °°”

"This observation and recommendation, repeated in previous audits, has
been successively addressed by increasing levels of control. Since the
last audit the use of Generic Privileged Accounts is monitored continually
by Fujitsu. The granting of this privilege must be justified; is time-bound
and is reported monthly to the POL Information Security Management
Forum (ISMF) for approval by the head of Information Security. In
addition, where users have access to this privilege, their ability to ‘SUDO’
(switch privileges inside user session) is additionally monitored. As for
previous years there is a continuing need for certain key system activities
to be executed by these admin teams with these privileges. For out of
hour's support it is not possible to predict the privileges required for
support, therefore the use of elevated privileges is justified. [...JFurther
additional controls do not appear to be justified. However the rigor of the
monthly check at the ISMF will be tested to ensure it is adequate, if not

Steps will be taken to optimize the checking of these accounts.”

67 POL00143525, p.13-14.

Page 168 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

329. Post Office went onto state that; “The issues around privileged access are
focused on the possibility that a privileged user may abuse their access. Post
Office believes that the existing process provide sufficient transparency and
accountability to deter such activity. Post Office accepts that deterrence is not
as strong as prevention. Consequently, Post Office’s attention will address
enhancing the process to ensure that lapses in record keeping cannot easily
occur in the future; and that attention will be given to enhancing this
accountability and transparency where possible.”

330. A meeting of the Risk and Compliance Committee in September 2012
received a summary of the Management Control audits performed over the
previous two years by EY. It recommended that controls in place were sufficient
to mitigate the existing low risk exposure. It proposed that the Committee
should agree the acceptance of the risks associated with the audit findings.

331. A report was made to the Risk and Compliance Committee in November
2012 providing an update on the progress of the IT audit rectification plan

following the 2011/12 EY Audit.*®? The report noted the completed actions from

the EY report (which included those in relation to privileged access, being:

a. review of privileged access to determine if the level of privilege is
appropriate;
b. consider implementing monitoring controls to ensure that robust security

practices are in place; and

WITN03680200

c. implement a Post Office owned periodic review of appropriateness to

determine if there is any inappropriate access.

332. The report also noted a number of actions from the EY report that required
endorsement by the Committee including that: “there is a risk that people make
unauthorised changes to the systems and affect our data integrity.” The steps
taken in mitigation were listed, as was the basis for why these were thought to
be acceptable. It is my understanding, from my review of this report, that Post
Office believed at this time that the controls in place were:“... adequate to
mitigate the risk of unauthorized changes, they are: 1. Post Office reviews all
privilege access requests; Usage is monitored and reviewed. 3. Changes to

IDs are reported immediately to the Post Office. 4. Periodic reviews take
place to re-approve all such IDs.”3”°

333. In December 2012, Post Office ‘Internal Audit & Risk Management -
Horizon System Control Assurance Review’?”’ was carried out to assess the
degree to which the issues raised in the 2011/2012 EY Management Letter had
been addressed by Post Office's management. The review reported that:
"Generic privileged accounts remain in use on Horizon by Fujitsu. A paper was
presented to the November POL Risk and Compliance Committee where any
residual business risks associated with this control were accepted by IT and
Change on behalf of the business. Implication: Accountability in the application
may not be fully controlled, leading to a risk of inappropriate activities being

undertaken within the system".

WITN03680200

334. An Audit and Risk Committee meeting in May 2013 recorded the following
in its minutes that: “They [Ernst & Young] congratulated the business for the
improvements in the IT controls, stressing that this had been driven by good
governance and a tight control framework. The co-ordinated audit between
Finance and IT was highlighted as a success and Sarah Hall and Lesley Sewell
were to be thanked for their input.’°’2

335.1 understand that, in early 2013, Post Office agreed with Fujitsu that at
Fujitsu’s cost they would separately engage EY to assess its controls and
produce a ISAE 3402 report, in order to provide a description of Fujitsu’s total
IT support processes and controls operated in managing the Post Office
Account for Horizon on-line and POLSAP.%7° The report produced on 4 March
2013 was entitled, “Fujitsu and E&Y: ISAE 3402 report: Description of Fujitsu’s
System of IT Infrastructure Services supporting Post Office Limited’s POLSAP
and HNG-X applications”.°”4

336. This was a very detailed report which gives the reader the overall impression
of a robust system with substantial controls in place, which had been spot
tested and validated by EY. It referred to the "Managed Service Change (MSC)
operational change" and said that "In summary, MSC is a Fujitsu toolset that
allows a securely accessed, time stamped auditable system to record change,
provides Service Delivery Units and Service owners with audit trails and gives
reasonable assurance that modifications to software and infrastructure are
assessed for risks & impacts. The changes are authorised by the Service owner

and Change Manager, are tested by appropriate methods. Teams are approved

to be deployed to a live environment subject to testing results, they are
implemented by the authorised and approved teams and the changes are
documented into new or existing documentation."

337. The report further explained that, "The principle of “least privilege” is used to
restrict the access rights of users whether human or non-human" and the role
of the "The Information Security Monthly Forum (ISMF) [as] a formalised
monthly forum where Post Office and Fujitsu Security production risk and
control concerns / issues are raised and progressed with the necessary
stakeholders" who have a role in reviewing the "Active Directory User Access
Review" of users and their associated privileges. It explained that certain users
within Fujitsu had "access to administer POL's databases" which were said to
be "restricted to appropriate Fujitsu personnel required to have this level of
access by their role." The section went on to explain that "Database access
control also requires individual role-based accounts for each class of user, both
for controlling the actions a user can perform and for helping to ensure
administrative and other actions are traceable to an individual to provide a valid
and informative audit trail." It stated that controls existed to provide reasonable
assurance that remote access was appropriately restricted to authorised
personnel.

338. My understanding is that this report was made available to Post Office and
that Post Office relied upon it as assurance of the security and integrity of the
exercise, monitoring and auditability of Fujitsu's access rights. The ‘EY Post
Office Limited: Report to the Audit and Risk Committee 2012-13 Audit

Results Report’ dated 14 May 2013°”° stated that; “No significant findings were

375 POLO0144637, p.197

Page 172 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

noted in the ISAE 3402 report commissioned by Fujitsu, and we have therefore
been able to rely upon it for our IT audit. We were also able to place reliance
on the effectiveness of automated controls within HNGX and POLSAP for
financial statement audit purposes.”

339.1 have reviewed an e-mail sent on 24 April 2014 enclosed a PowerPoint
presentation entitled ‘Follow Up Review of Key System Controls in Horizon’
prepared by Internal Audit & Risk Management for presentation to Post
Office’’®, which stated that: "Through consultation with Fujitsu, POL
management have confirmed that privileged generic accounts are controlled
and will not be replaced with individual accounts. The residual business risk
associated with this control was accepted by IT and Change at the November
POL Risk & Compliance Committee on behalf of the business."

340. Subsequently, in 2014, it is my understanding that Deloitte were engaged at
the request of the Post Office Board to conduct a desktop review of certain
Horizon matters raised in the context of the Initial Review and Mediation
Scheme.

341. At the Board meeting on 30 April 2014, the outcome of this review by Deloitte
(referred to as Project Zebra) was discussed.*”” Deloitte’s proposal paper for
Phase 2 of Project Zebra was stated to have been devised to assist Post Office
in answering questions that included: “what assurance could be provided over
how the system records and maintains the transaction logs” “...in the context of
Specific allegations regarding non-traceable, “phantom” transactions existing in

Horizon”.

376 POL00398154
377 POL00021524

Page 173 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

342. In May and June 2014, Deloitte produced two documents for Post Office as
part of Project Zebra entitled ‘Horizon: Desktop Review of Assurance
Sources and Key Control Features’ and an accompanying ‘Board Briefing’.
It is my understanding that Deloitte did not test any of the relevant Horizon
features and were not required to revalidate the work supplied to them.

343. The Board Briefing notes 2 means by which appropriately authorised Fujitsu
users could theoretically remotely alter branch transaction data which were as
follows:
a.through the processing of a certain type of centrally generated

transaction, ‘Balancing Transactions’; and
b. database access privileges allowing the theoretical deletion and
replacement of data in the Audit Store. Deloitte observed that this was a

matter contrary to Post Office's then understanding.°”°

344.On 4 June 2014, Deloitte produced a Board Briefing®’® following their
‘Horizon: Desktop review of assurance sources and key control features’

report dated 23 May 2014. The briefing stated that:

a. "POL is reliant on the features identified being implemented and
operating as described. In particular evidence based testing is not
available relating to relevant business processes and inbuilt controls,

other than access controls.

378 POL00399614
379 POL00030451

Page 174 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

b. Assurance evidence no longer remains available from the original
implementation project. POL’s historic comfort is therefore sourced from
assertions from POL and Fujitsu staff.

[oe Data is permanently deleted from the Audit Store after seven years. We
understand that some allegations relate to periods older than seven
years.

d. It is possible for Fujitsu staff with suitably authorised privileged access
to delete data from the Audit Store.

e. Sub-postmaster reports showing detailed transactions of their Branch
are limited to the current accounting period and part of the prior
accounting period, and are not drawn from the Audit Store.

f Digital signatures and digital seals are a key control feature underpinning
the integrity of Horizon. In considering the design of the Horizon
Features, we would expect that there would be activities or testing
performed to verify it had been implemented as designed; the need for
those controls is borne out by the fact that one of the features has not

been implemented as expected."

345.A Post Office action summary from June 2014%®° referred to the risk of
someone with remote access being able to delete data. I have not been able to
establish if this summary was seen by the General Counsel team. The summary
proposes setting up a "Horizon Management Council" with representatives from
Post Office and Fujitsu and notes that:"... it was possible for ‘someone with

privileged access to delete data from specific areas of Horizon. This is always

380 POL00401635,

Page 175 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

a risk with individuals using admin or power user accounts and is a persistent
risk, one that needs to be catered for in almost any organisation. Due to the
sensitive nature of the information contained in the databases, monitoring of
those databases should be put in place using technology to detect and record
deletions and administrative changes to the databases. If possible, alerts
should also be generated for mass deletions and high level risk changes to
database schemas."

346. On 21 July 2014, the Risk and Compliance Committee received a paper
that summarised the findings and recommendations of Deloitte’s Project Zebra.
The paper outlined Post Office management's proposed actions concerning
testing controls around Balancing Transactions, improvements concerning the
FSC documentation processes, and a review of the risk and control framework
around the Horizon system.

347. The Risk and Compliance Committee was invited to support the proposed
actions. However, as with other documents in this statement, I have reviewed
this document in isolation and have been unable to establish through the review
of further documents whether the RCC did ultimately do so.°°"

348. I have had sight of an internal Post Office ‘ClO Risk Log’*®? from April 2016
which noted that: "There is a risk that unauthorised individuals have access and
those who have left the business may also still have access, which will result in
potential security violations and consequences to the Post Office business".

349. A review was subsequently commissioned by Post Office’s then Chairman, to

be conducted by Jonathan Swift QC and Christopher Knight, which reported in

381 POL00206524
82 POL00401633

Page 176 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

February 2016.°*° This referred to Deloitte’s reporting in May and June 2014
and noted that: "Deloitte’s Board Briefing highlights two aspects of Horizon
which are relevant to this part of the Review and which we found to be more
clearly set out than in any other document we have seen on this subject.”

350. It was also stated by Deloitte that, following a review of the technical
documentation, the ISAE3402 and verbal discussions with Post Office and

Fujitsu it had identified:

a. database access privileges which “would enable a person to delete a
digitally signed basket’ do exist,but are “restricted to authorised
administrators at Fujitsu”.

b. Those privileges “would enable a person to create or amend a basket

and re-sign it with a ‘fake’ key, detectable if appropriately checked”.

351. Deloitte had not identified specific controls to prevent a person with the
appropriate authorisation carrying out the exercise described above in an
unauthorised manner.

352. The document went on to state that administrators had the ability to “delete
data from the Audit Store during the seven year period, which was a
matter...contrary to POL’s understanding...This could allow suitably authorised
Staff in Fujitsu to delete a sealed set of baskets and replace them with properly
sealed baskets, although they would have to fake the digital signatures”. When
we spoke to Deloitte, they described this functionality as resulting, in essence,
from the level of security contained in Horizon being a level down from the

maximum.

83 POL00030452

Page 177 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

353. The document went on to state that:

a. “We have seen a response from Fujitsu concerning this aspect of
Deloitte’s investigation, which is based upon a summary of it provided
by POL rather than the original Board Briefing itself. Fujitsu appear to
accept that Deloitte’s interpretation is technically correct, but emphasise
the wide range of security measures in the software, hardware and
environment which reduce the risk of interference. Fujitsu also, properly,
stress that there is no evidence that any such action has occurred and
that likelihood of all the security measures being overcome is so small
that it does not represent a credible line of further enquiry.”

b. “The fact that such activity is possible does not, of course, indicate that
it has actually occurred. We find it difficult to see why it would have done

So.

354. Pursuant to their instructions, Jonathan Swift QC and Christopher Knight
made two recommendations concerning further investigations into remote
access that should be carried out by Post Office. These were, in summary, that:

Post Office instruct a suitably qualified party to carry out:

a. a full review of the use of Balancing Transactions throughout the lifetime
of the Horizon system, insofar as possible, to independently confirm from
Horizon system records the number and circumstances of their use; and

b. a full review of the controls over the use and capability of authorised

Fujitsu personnel to create, amend or delete baskets within a sealed

Page 178 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Audit Store throughout the lifetime of the Horizon system, insofar as

possible.

355. I have not been able to establish, based on my review of documentation for
the purposes of preparing this statement, if these recommendations were
carried out.

356. It is my understanding though that, thereafter, in 2016, Deloitte circulated a
preliminary ‘Project Bramble’ report. This observed that certain privileged
Fujitsu users were able to add, amend or delete transactions entered by branch
staff on Horizon outside the specific functionality of the system were considered
to be particular material.

357. Deloitte also circulated a draft "Project Sparrow" report for discussion in July
2016%* concerning the use of balancing transactions. Amongst other matters,
the report noted in respect of "superusers" that: "At various layers of the Horizon
infrastructure there exist accounts with privileged access rights which could be
used to modify or insert data relevant to transactions at branches should they
not be adequately controlled. For example, a superuser account on the Oracle
DB forming the nucleus of the Branch Database could insert transactions
directly onto the backend (effectively Balancing Transactions are a specialised
‘legitimised’ way of using such Oracle access)."

358. It is my understanding that Deloitte prepared a draft third version of the

Bramble report on 27 July 2016 and subsequently in October 2016°°.

84 POL00029984
85 POL00400064; POL00400125.

Page 179 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Thereafter, between October and December 2017, Deloitte produced further

drafts of the Bramble report®®®, which stated (amongst other matters) that:

a. "A limited number of authorised Fujitsu personnel (19 at the Operating
System layer and 26 at the database layer, at the time of testing - May
2016) have sufficient privileges to theoretically add / delete / change data
in the BRDB (Privileged Users). However, see paragraph 1.4.2.10 below
regarding the segregation of access conditions. These users may also
have access to other systems, such as the Audit Store, however in the
current circumstances access to the BRDB is the most important as it is
the BRDB that generates the branch accounts and is the source of the
data ultimately used to hold Postmasters liable for shortfalls.

b. Post Office personnel do not have this Privileged User access and
Fujitsu and Post Office have asserted that they have never had such
access, however there is no historic record of all the Privileged Users

that there have ever been, so this cannot be verified."

359. EY, in their capacity as "Independent Service Auditor", contained in the
‘Description of Fujitsu's System of IT Infrastructure Services’ for the period
1 April 2017 to 31 December 2017°°’, stated (amongst other matters) that:
”_..the controls related to the control objectives stated in the Description were
suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives
would be achieved if the controls operated effectively throughout the period 1
April 2017 to 31 December 2017 and if POL applied the complementary user

entity controls contemplated in the design of Fujitsu’s controls throughout the

86 POL00401550; POL00400287
87 POL00401634

Page 180 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

period 1 April 2017 to 31 December 2017.c. the controls tested, which, together
with the complementary user entity controls referred to in the scope paragraph
of this report if operating effectively, were those necessary to provide
reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the Description were
achieved, operated effectively throughout the period 1 April 2017 to 31
December 2017."

360. A further draft Bramble report wasprepared by Deloitte in February 2018°°.

In relation to Horizon Online and remote access, the report found:

a. "Fujitsu (but not Post Office) has the ability to add, amend or delete
transactions entered by branch staff on Horizon via Privileged Users
outside of specific functionality of the Horizon application.”

b. “A limited number of authorised Fujitsu personnel (19 at the Operating
System layer and 26 at the database layer at the time of testing - May
2016) have sufficient privileges to theoretically add / delete / change data
in the BRDB (“Privileged Users”)."

c. "Post Office personnel do not have this Privileged User access and
Fujitsu and Post Office have asserted that they have never had such
access, however there is no historic record of all the Privileged Users
that there have ever been, so this cannot be verified."

d. “Changes to a branch's transaction data in the BRDB by Privileged
Users would be visible to branch staff. The amended transaction would
show up in transaction reports produced in branch but would not be

flagged as a change by a Privileged User and to the best of our

388 POL00253246

Page 181 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

knowledge would appear like a normal transaction generated in branch
(although see paragraph 1.4.2.14 below around database logging of the
actions of Privileged Users).”

e. “We would expect a system such as Horizon to have this type of
Privileged User access as it will be used to undertake maintenance on
the system or to implement updates. Such access comes with a risk of
it being misused, either by accident or maliciously. It is impossible to
eliminate this risk entirely (within Horizon or any other IT system) and so
systems generally have controls over the use of privileged access so as
to reduce the risk or misuse or to make it detectable.”

fe “A key control in Horizon is the segregation of access permissions
between Privileged Users who can access the BRDB and those users
who may access the Key Management Server (KMS). The KMS holds
the digital keys that underpin the controls listed in paragraph 1.4.2.2.
Segregation of Privileged Users from KMS users means that a Privileged
User cannot get around the controls in paragraph 1.4.2.2 and therefore
cannot cover up any changes they make in the BRDB (Controls 1.4.2.2
b, c, d and e are of particular importance). If a proper segregation of
duties is in place, any changes by a single Privileged User to the BRDB
would be detectable in line with paragraphs 1.4.2.2 b, c, d and e above.
This does not eliminate the risk of misuse entirely as there could be a

conspiracy between a Privileged user and a KMS user."

361. It is my understanding that Deloitte was unable to carry out testing of Legacy
Horizon (named Riposte) but reached the following views on remote access by

carrying out interviews and reviewing technical documentation:

Page 182 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

"(a) On the Riposte system the data was held locally on a Branch Server
and then replicated to a cluster of central servers overnight. On HNG-X
a key principle is branch data is only held centrally (on the BRDB).

(b) A Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) function provided functionality
similar to the digital signature in that it provided a checksum capability.
A checksum applies a predetermined algorithm to a set of data to
produce an output. When transmitted or held with the data the checksum
algorithm can be reapplied to validate whether the dataset is complete
and accurate. Unlike the digital signature applied by Horizon to Counter
transactions, this is not cryptographically secure and_ technically
competent people can generate CRCs simply (i.e. it is at greater risk of
tampering).

(c) Once data was received from a branch server by the centralised
server farm it would be duplicated to all nodes in the farm (they were four
clusters), meaning that challenges in terms of altering the data would
likely still exist (as data would now be different between different nodes),
causing a data integrity issue which would be likely to generate system
errors and be noticed if only one location was updated.

(d) Riposte was a third party provided system, meaning that neither
Fujitsu nor Post Office would have been likely to have ready access to
the source code of the application. Access to source code is an
imperative requirement to being able to change the underlying code or
functionality of the application and the fact that Post Office or Fujitsu
would have probably had to approach the vendor in order to do so, would

inherently lower the risk of malicious changes to the application from

Page 183 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

privileged users (although not necessarily the amendment of
transactions data within the system).

(e)The Audit Store technology was largely identical to the instance
supporting Horizon HNG-X at the point of adoption (including the audit
server).

(f) Fujitsu have stated that due to (b), (c) and (d) above an application
would need to be inserted onto a branch server to manipulate
transactions prior to them being distributed to the datacentre and that
whilst there is a theoretical possibility this could be achieved, it is

considered by Fujitsu to be a ‘remote possibility’."

362.1 have had sight of an agenda and meeting pack that was prepared for a
meeting of Post Office's Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee in May
2019. In that pack, it appears to have been noted that user access was not
being removed on a timely basis, as well as concerns having been expressed
by PwC in relation to employees who were no longer working for Post Office
still having access to Horizon. 3°?

363. I have also reviewed a similar agenda from May 2020 which included an audit
report by PwC for the year ended 29 March 2020. The report summarised what
were described as key deficiencies in Horizon, which included user access
rights not being terminated in a timely basis following the users leaving the Post
Office®®°

364. In December 2020, KPMG prepared a draft setting out their findings following

an audit report of the Horizon system*®'. Amongst other matters, this audit

91 POL00031727

Page 184 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

noted that there had been no progress in relation to privilege or elevated access
controls within the Horizon environment beyond the basic user enablement and

access. It was also stated that Post Office used limited controls around remote

access.

uestion 3(c) — “In respect of any internal measures identified in relation to point

b), please set out the technical expertise of those responsible for monitoring

compliance.”

365. Due to the passage of time, and an associated lack of document retention and
corporate knowledge within the Post Office business, I am unable to assist the
Inquiry by comprehensively detailing the technical expertise of those
responsible for monitoring compliance through the internal measures that I
have described above in response to Question 3(b) of the Rule 9 request.

366. However, my colleagues within Post Office’s HR department have been able
to locate:

a. some examples of role profiles for those who I understand would,
during the 2000-2019 period, have played some role in Post Office’s
internal monitoring of Fujitsu’s compliance with the relevant contractual

obligations; and

b. some limited information in relation to the technical qualifications held by
particular named individuals who I understand would have played a role

in the internal monitoring described above.

367.1 have set out below, in a table, the details of the role profiles that I refer to
above.

368.1 have also reviewed a document that is entitled “Qualifications for IT

87 POL00401680

Page 189 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

which I have referred to above) who held an ITIL°° certification. An ITIL
certification is, a qualification that helps the holder to demonstrate an in-depth
knowledge of the IT Service Management lifecycle. It is also my understanding
that the Codified Agreement was drafted with the ITIL Framework in mind. It
was therefore beneficial for those with responsibility for monitoring and
managing the Agreement to have the associated ITIL certification, where

possible.

Question _3(d) — “Whether Fujitsu_incurred any financial penalties (for the

avoidance of doubt, including payments for damages) during the relevant period

as a result of non-compliance with the relevant contractual obligations”

369. It is my understanding that Post Office's monitoring of Fujitsu's compliance
with the relevant contractual (and wider contractual) obligations as part of the
Service Review Structure that I have referred to above was closely linked to the
calculation of associated financial penalties. Throughout the 2000-2019 period,
it is my understanding that Post Office used 'Service Levels Targets’ stipulated
in SLAs to measure whether Fujitsu were complying with their obligations
pursuant to the contract. Fujitsu were responsible for monitoring these Service
Levels and reporting the extent to which they met them using the Service
Review Book.

370. If Fujitsu failed to meet the SLT, this represented a failure to meet their
contractual obligations. However, if they failed to meet them to a significant
enough degree (specified by defined thresholds within certain SLTs) then

remedies became available to Post Office.

398 I TIL is a global framework of best practices for IT service management focused on reducing risk,
improving customer relations and supporting IT environments.

Page 190 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

371. Although the remedies and thresholds changed throughout the course of the
Codified Agreement, it is my understanding that the liability, remediation and

payment structure remained consistent throughout the 2000-2019 period.
Thresholds for Remedies

372. In the Original Codified Agreement, the different thresholds through which

Post Office could seek remedies for contractual non-compliance were:

a. The Minimum Acceptable Threshold (‘MAT’). Post Office was
entitled to the remedies in the given Service Level and Remedies
Schedule for the given Service if the MAT was breached.°99 For
example, Schedule G10 (which concerns Post Office infrastructure
services) stated if Fujitsu breached their HSH obligation to repair 'A
Priority’ problems or incidents within 12 hours, then liquidated damages
would become payable. This is shown in the table of "time to repair’
profiles in the table below at paragraph 378. In addition, unless
otherwise specified, if Fujitsu failed to reach the MAT for a particular
service for three quarterly Service Level Measurement Periods in any
24-month period, Post Office was entitled to terminate the Codified
Agreement.4°

b. In addition, if the level of service provided fell below the Termination
Review Threshold (‘TRT’) then Post Office was also entitled to
terminate the Codified Agreement.202 In addition, if the service fell

below the TRT, liquidated damages and ‘failure damages at large**”’

399 Schedule A6, 1999 Codified Agreement

400 Clause 902.2 — as per Paragraph 4.4, Schedule A6, 1999 Codified Agreement

401 This means that damages would be determined by a court after the breach rather than in the
liquidated form provided for in the Codified Agreement.

Page 191 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

would, in that instance, be payable. If Post Office decided not to
terminate the agreement, an alternative option was available for the
parties to agree a method of rectification.4°2

373. In Schedule 15 of the 2002 Agreement and Schedules B4.4 and C1 of the

Current Contract, the thresholds were expressed differently as follows:

a. The Liquidated Damage Threshold (‘LDT’) which, if not achieved by
Fujitsu, gave rise to the payment of liquidated damages in the same way
that they would have been payable in the event of a breach of the MAT

in the Original Codified Agreement.

b. An Additional Remedy Level (‘ARL’) was the level of service, below
the SLT and (if applicable) the LDT, which, if not achieved by Fujitsu,
gave rise to the payment of Post Office’s Additional Costs.*°° These
Additional Costs would be those that Post Office had incurred as a
result of breach of the service level — which could include additional

staff costs, help desk services or telephone calls.4*

374. The remedies that were available for different SLTs were summarised in the
CCD ‘Service Level Targets for Horizon Services’, which referred to the Service
Levels from the Codified Agreement but described them in a more user-friendly

375. It is my understanding that not every SLT for a Service Level Sub-Obligation
had associated remedies. As a result, it was possible for Fujitsu not to meet a
SLT without any financial consequences. By way of example, for the 'Hours of
Service’ Service Level Sub-Obligation, there were no liquidated damages

payable regardless of how far beneath the Service Level Target Fujitsu fell.

Monitoring of Liqguidated Damages and Monitoring of Service Levels

376. The monitoring of liquidated damages was closely linked to the Service

Review Process.

377. The Service Review Book contained an annex that detailed which remedies
were payable between Version 1 at the beginning of the term and Version 2
of the new series issued on 20 February 2008 — after which point this obligation
was removed.

378. In the Service Review Book, the performance tables listed which remedy was
available for each Service Level Sub-Obligation (as well as using colour coding
to reflect the extent to which Fujitsu had met the SLT). As I have explained
above in paragraphs 85-90, these are the columns in the right-hand side —
which mirror the thresholds for the Original Codified Agreement that I have
referred to above. This stated that the MAT would be breached where Fujitsu
failed the 12 Hour Time to Repair Obligation for Remote Branches in 95% of
cases; which reflects the Liquidated Damages provision in the 1999 Codified

Agreement Schedule G10, Paragraph 3.2.2.

Calculation of Liquidated Damages

379. Each Service Level Sub-Obligation would calculate damages in different ways
if the liquidated damages threshold was breached. The method of calculating
the liquidated damages due depended on which Service Level had been
breached, the scale of the breach (e.g. volume, duration) and the application of
any cap on damages. The exact method of calculation would be set out in the
relevant schedule of the Codified Agreement.

380. By way of example, Schedule G10, paragraph 3.2.4 detailed the calculation
for the HSH “Time to Repair” obligation. When the 12-hour Remedial
Timeframe for the “Time to Repair a Remote Priority A incident or problem” was

exceeded, the damages payable were then calculated as follows:

a. Downtime cost =

((Seconds of Outlet downtime - (12 * 3600)) * number of automated Counter Positions

in Outlet * pence) ;

381.1 have reviewed an example of how liquidated damages were calculated in

relation to the SLT that related to Branch and Counter Unavailability for the year

Page 194 of 255
WITN03680200
WITNO03680200

2013/2014*°”. In that instance, no liquidated damages were ultimately deemed

payable.

Financial Penalties for Failing to Meet Service Levels

382. Throughout all of its versions, the MIS:SD that I have referred to above at
paragraph 844° stated that if Post Office disagreed with Fujitsu's calculation of
liquidated damages this would, at first, be discussed at an Operational Level.
Should this fail, it would be escalated to the Senior Management Level (the
Horizon Forum (See paragraph 75)) and then the Commercial Level. The Board
that sat at the Commercial Level differed across the three Agreements. By way

of example:

a. In the Original Codified Agreement, under Schedule A04, it was the
Contract Steering Group who resolved issues that were no resolved at

the Horizon Forum;

407 FUJ00080297

414 This defined the contents of the Service Review Book and explained its purpose. It stated it was the
“primary input into the Service Management Forum on performance against SLTS. It also detailed the
other monthly reports that Fujitsu were obliged to provide.

Page 195 of 255
WITNO03680200

WITNO3680200
b. In the 2002 Agreement, under Schedule 4, it was the Commercial
Forum;
Ge In the Current Contract, under Schedule A2, it was the Commercial
Relationship.

383.Across the three Agreements, this was the Board that managed and
administrated the Codified Agreement as a whole — and it is my understanding
that Board meetings were attended by both party’s Contract Managers and
Commercial Managers/Directors.

384. Once Post Office and Fujitsu concluded that there had been a failure to meet
a Service Level, it is my understanding that Fujitsu was obliged to pay Post
Office in accordance with the applicable associated type of remedy (ARL or LD)
and the calculation stipulated in the Codified Agreement.

385. Specifically, Schedule 9 of the 2002 Agreement stated that payment would be
in the form of Credit Notes (or, at Post Office’s discretion, payments of cash) —
in accordance with Clause 29, which states that the payment should be within
30 days. Post Office needed to have actively exercised the option to receive
liquidated damages otherwise it would be deemed, pursuant to the Codified
Agreement, to have elected to receive Service Credits instead.4°° 41° 411

386. The Service Credits were required to be credited, or liquidated damages paid,

within 30 days of receipt of a valid claim made by the Post Office. 41? Any claims

409 1999 Codified Agreement, Clause 802.2

410 In terms of impact, Service Credit would be the same in practice as a Credit Note.

411 The way in which Service Credits would be credited would normally, as I understand it, be facilitated
through deductions from service charges (which are billed monthly).

412 Clause 802.5, 1999 Codified Agreement

for liquidated damages and Service Credits were subject to the aggregate
liability caps.4"°

387. It is my understanding that these credit notes were issued on a standard form
invoice, which detailed the Service Description and amount payable. These
invoices also tracked the number of Manual Error Reports throughout the given

quarter.4"4

Instances of Liquidated Damages being paid by Fujitsu for breaches of the

relevant contractual obligations.

388. It is my understanding, having spoken with colleagues in Post Office's
Finance Department, that responsibility for operating Post Office’s accounts
payable lay with Royal Mail Group until September 2014. Enquiries have been
made with Royal Mail Group who no longer hold any documentation associated
with that function. Efforts have also been made to contact HCL Technologies,
who were the associated software provider for the period up till 2014, but these
efforts proved unsuccessful. As a result, I am not able to assist the Inquiry in
identifying any instances of liquidated damages being paid by Fujitsu for
breaches of the relevant contractual obligations between 2000 and 2014.

389. It is my understanding though, having spoken with colleagues in Post Office’s
Finance Department, that 96 Credit Notes have been identified for the period
between 2014 and 2017. However, it is my understanding that, as the records
associated with those Notes were not complete, it is hard to determine exactly
what the Credit Notes related to. I have been advised that significant references

are made in the associated documentation to rebates being paid to Post Office

where time, materials or disbursements incurred by Fujitsu pursuant to their
contractual obligations were less than expected or the metrics delivered were
lower than estimated. As a result, on the limited information that has been
provided to me about these Service Credits, it would seem that they were not
examples of liquidated damages being payable by Fujitsu as a result of a
breach of the relevant contractual obligations.

390. It is my understanding, having spoken with colleagues who were involved in
Contractual management of the Codified Agreement during the period from
2017 onwards, that a credit deemed payable in relation to an SLA or SDT
breach would be deducted from the following month’s invoice as issued by
Fujitsu. A formal credit note would only, as I understand it, be issued at Post
Office’s specific request.

391.1 understand that SLA/SLT credits, if issued, would, from at least 2017
onwards, be recorded in the documents associated with the Monthly
Commercial Review Meetings and on the face of any invoices applying the
credits. However, I have not been provided with or identified any such

documents.

392. It is my understanding that, since 2017, there has only been one instance of
Fujitsu being required to pay liquidated damages for an identified breach of the
relevant contractual obligations. This occurred when Fujitsu failed to deliver

Automated Payment Service data files to the Post Office Data Gateway against
the SLT, as detailed further below.

395. In my role as IT Director for Horizon, I am responsible for:

a.

managing the Post Office Horizon Leadership Team and working with
third party suppliers involved in Horizon, which is made up of various
sub-teams which focus on different aspects of the Horizon IT System
(including Postmaster Experience, Commercial Management, Quality
Assurance, Horizon Live Services, Remediation and Change as well as
Security, Risk & Investigations).

designing and implementing changes following the GLO litigation to
ensure that Post Office IT takes steps to resolve issues identified in
the Horizon Issues Judgement (HlJ).

Supporting the Post Office Chief Transformation Officer and forming

part of the Post Office Technology Leadership Team.

In order to support my response to question 4 of the Rule 9 request, I
have included the diagram below that illustrates the teams that are

responsible for the processes outlined in my statement.

refer to below) which is part of Post Office’s wider IT function supports

Postmasters and wider Post Office staff.

My approach to responding to question 4 of the Rule 9 request

397. In Part 1 of this section of my statement, I have responded to Question 4(a)
which asks about changes made since 17 December 2019 to the present day
to the levels of testing, monitoring, compliance and reporting on i) BEDS in the
Horizon IT system ii) other NSFs and iii) the impact of such events on branch
accounts.

398. In Part 1, I have also responded to question 4 (b) and outlined changes or
improvements that have been made to the management, rectification and

reporting of BEDs in the Horizon IT system since 17 December 2019.

399. In Part 2, I have responded to question 4c) about changes or improvements
that have been made to any internal or external measures to monitor Fujitsu's
compliance with the Relevant Contractual Obligations (as defined by the Inquiry

in R9(48)) from 17 December 2019 to date.

400. In Part 3, I have responded to question 4d).

Summary

401. The overall performance and status of the Horizon platform is managed by
Fujitsu via our agreement for the provision of services from Fujitsu, the scope

of these services is detailed in response to question 3(a).

402. In terms of Questions 4(a) & 4(b), by way of high-level summary:

a. In January 2021, Post Office established a Horizon Testing Team of
11 Post Office IT employees who test changes made to the Horizon
platform and who are responsible for the testing of all changes made to
the system either by Fujitsu or by Post Office itself. Testing will occur
either when a change is proposed to the Horizon system or following
the identification and remediation of a BED. The Horizon Testing Team
have introduced a level of rigour to ensure that BEDs are identified
before a change is made to the live system. Any BED detected during

testing follows a strict process as outlined below.

b. In 2020/2021, following the HIJ, Post Office implemented AppDynamics
which is a system manufactured by AppDynamics Inc that is

independent of Horizon itself and provides automated monitoring &

Page 202 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

alerting capabilities that Post Office did not previously have to monitor
the performance of the Horizon system.

If a BED is detected in the live Horizon system (which is the system in
operation), it is reported into the ITSD. Reports can be made by a
Postmaster, members of their team or other Horizon users such as a
Branch Manager conducting a visit. The ITSD is managed by analysts
working with various sets of guidance and knowledge documents. The
analysts have a set of knowledge-based articles (“KBAs”) which is a
bulletin of things they need to know. For example, if there is a known
BED within Horizon, it will have been the subject of a KBA that the ITSD
analysts can refer to in the event that a problem associated with that
BED is raised with them. The BED would then be managed through the
Defect Management process (which is described further below) which is
operated by the Horizon Live Service Team. An investigation is
conducted by this team, this investigation is managed and monitored by
the Branch Technology Defects Lead.

The network that the Horizon system uses to communicate with Post
Office branches was managed by Fujitsu at the outset of the Horizon
service. However, on 21 May 2015, Post Office entered into a contract
with Verizon to take on this management and review function. As a
result, any network failures from 2013 to date would be picked up
through Verizon. However, on an operational level AppDynamics (as

described above) also ensures visibility of network system failures.

Page 203 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

e. The impact of any BEDs or system failures on branch accounts would

be identified and managed through the Defect Management Process
which I detail further below.

403. As stated above, I joined Post Office in September 2020. Before this date, I

am not aware of any coordinated effort to systematically implement a series of

improvements or changes in relation to the areas covered in this question.

The Horizon Issues Remediation Programme

404. Following the Horizon Issues Judgment (“HIJ”), Common Issues Judgment

and Hamilton judgments, Post Office embarked on a series of reviews, the
purpose of which was to identify what improvements were needed across the

Post Office business in order to remediate and improve on the matters set out
in the judgments.

405. As a result of the analysis carried out by Post Office following those reviews,

a programme of activity to thematically address all 15 of the findings from the

HIJ was instigated (the “Horizon Issues Remediation Programme” (‘the

fil

HlJ

“Programme’”)). For ease of reference, I have detailed each of those 15

indings below:

number

Defects caused apparent or alleged discrepancies or shortfalls relating

to sub- postmasters branch accounts or transactions.

Page 204 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Sub- postmasters were not informed about identified defects. Some
defects were not identified by automatic system check and as a result,

lay undiscovered for years.

Legacy Horizon and HNG-X were not remotely robust, as identified by

the number of defects found.

Data errors, arising from data entry, transfer or processing in both legacy
Horizon and HNG-X led to financial discrepancies. Errors in reference
data, and 3rd party data contributed to discrepancies in branch

accounts.

Transaction data reconciliation with 3rd party data leading to manual

corrective fixes and transactional corrections.

Legacy Horizon and HNG-X measures and controls did not prevent,
identify or report or reduce a) data entry errors b) data packet or system
level errors c) software coding errors or bugs d) transmission, replication
and storage of transactional record data errors e) data stored in the
central data centre was not an accurate record of transactions on

branch terminal.

considered inadequate.

12 How often was the remote and privileged access facility used by Post
Office and Fujitsu.

13 Appsup privileged access rights were very wide and had the potential to
affect the reliability of sub postmaster branch accounts.

14 Ability for sub postmaster to dispute a discrepancy via Horizon.

15 Over 100,000 Transaction Corrections issued since 2006; Post Office
does not have comprehensive records on how many have been
challenged. TCs used to correct branch accounts with no opportunity to

challenge.

406. Post Office identified 5 thematic categories from the 15 findings of the HIJ that

I have detailed above:

a. Management of Horizon Defects

b. Management of Core Horizon Data (incl. Reference and Third-Party)

407. The first stage of the Programme was a diagnostic activity to identify the
current processes in place for various aspects of managing the Horizon
platform, this included the management, rectification and reporting of BEDS,
the approach to testing the Horizon IT system, as well as the overall

governance measures that were in place for the management of the Fujitsu

contract. The subsequent programme phases have implemented a series of

improvements and changes as detailed below.

Improvements to Testing of the Horizon system

408. The testing of Horizon by Post Office has been executed in a number of ways
over the lifetime of the system. Between September 2013 and April 2021 this
was executed on Post Office’s behalf by Atos IT Services UK Limited (“ATOS’).
Further details about this are provided as part of my statement responding to
question 3 of the Rule 9 request.

409. In January 2021, Post Office began to establish an internal Horizon testing
capability (which was the Horizon Testing Team I have described above) and
in April 2021, following the creation of that team, the A TOS test resources were
transferred back to Post Office, supplementing the test capability. Testing takes
place every time there is a proposed change to Horizon to check the
functionality is operating as expected and to ensure that the impact of the
change does not adversely affect other parts of the system. A change to the
system may be required in order to implement new or updated functionality for
the Horizon system or where a BED has resulted in a need to change existing
functionality.

410. During the course of testing, the Horizon Testing Team’s objective is to
identify areas of functionality where the system is not working as expected or
the system does not meet the requirements which are set out by Post Office
when it has identified that new or amended functionality is required. The aim is
to ensure the number of BEDs identified gradually reduces as testing is

performed. It will never be possible to completely eradicate BEDs from an IT

Page 208 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

system, but the purpose of the Horizon Testing Team’s work is to endeavour to
reduce the number of BEDs, once identified, in accordance with industry good
practice and the defect thresholds set by Post Office that I will discuss further
below.

411. This helps to ensure that any proposed changes to the Horizon system have
to pass a series of review points before ultimately being released to the live

system.

412. The testing work that I have described above is now standard operational
practice for Post Office’s Horizon IT Team and is aligned to normal industry
practice for the management of change within systems that are akin to Horizon.
In addition to the testing work that I have described above, a further

improvement in testing have been implemented, which include:

a. Embedding consistent processes for the categorisation of BEDS.

b. The setting of threshold limits for BEDS, dependant on their impact and
severity (see below).

ce. Implementation of supporting systems using industry standards and
tools such as Jira (which I describe further below) for the recording of
testing activity to ensure transparency and reportability of testing

outcomes.

Testing: Embedding Consistent Processes to Identify & Categorise Horizon
BEDs

413.A common set of BED definitions has been established to help ensure

consistent terminology is used to identify system BEDs going forwards which

Page 209 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

describes the impact of the BED in question. BEDs are categorised by both

severity and business impact, as shown in the tables below.

Severity: Extent of impact a BED has on the development or operation on a

component or system

Defect Type I Definition

Urgent The BED would cause business processes or operations to halt or
mean Post Office are not compliant or meeting legislation and

therefore requires an urgent fix, ideally in the next release.

High The BED would have noticeable impact to the business, even with
workarounds. It can be fixed in upcoming releases; however, a

resolution needs to be included within the release.

Medium BED has minor impact to day-to-day business processes and

operations. The BED can be resolved after the current release.

Low Negligible impact to the business, considered a ‘want’ more than a
‘need’ for business process and operations. The BED can be fixed

if there is time.

Business Priority: How important business deem fixing a BED in terms of

process, system, compliance or legislative impact.

Page 210 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Defect Type I Description

Blocker The BED is preventing essential functionality or critical data from
executing. There is no workaround for this issue and the solution

cannot be implemented completely with the issue unresolved.

Critical The BED is preventing essential functionality or major data from
executing. However, there are processes by which the issue can be

worked around.

Major The BED affects major functionality or non-critical data. There are
practical and usable workarounds that can be temporally
implement, or the functionality is considered non-essential to the

business proposition.

Minor A minor aspect of the solution is not functioning correctly. There
are clear workarounds that will allow the user to easily navigate the
system or the functionality is not essential to the business

proposition.

Trivial The error is worthy of note but has no impact on the successful

implementation of the solution.

414. This standardisation of terms further enables Post Office to identify the impact
on branch accounts. BEDs with the potential to impact on branch accounts
would be categorised as urgent and/or high severity and as a blocker and/or

Page 211 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

being of critical priority to be addressed. These would be addressed as a
priority over other BEDs that may be identified. For example, a BED classed
as Urgent and Critical would be addressed as a priority over a BED classed as
Urgent and Major. The time taken to fix any BED depends on the nature of the
issue, the associated technical complexity and the delivery mechanism for

remediating the defect (i.e. fix and release).

Testing: Setting the Thresholds for BEDs

415. The setting of BED thresholds is normal practice in the delivery and quality
assurance of any technology platform. Thresholds are typically set in line with
the quality expectations and risk appetite of the organisation utilising
technology. BED thresholds that would typically reflect that every system is
likely to encounter BEDs over the course of its lifespan either at the point of
initial implementation or as a result of changes to the platform being made over

time.

416. In 2022, the work that Post Office undertook as part of the Remediation
Programme, including the review of the approach to testing was completed.
One of the outputs of this review was the creation of a Post Office***Quality
Assurance Test Strategy. The strategy was created for use by Post Office
project delivery teams, external partners (such as Morrisons and DPD and Evri
delivery providers), third-party suppliers (such as Fujitsu or Accenture), and

internal Post Office business stakeholders (such as the Retail Operations

418 POL00337565: D.09.19_POLQAStrategy_V1.0 -Copy

Page 212 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

Team), as a guide of the quality assurance and testing activities at Post Office.

The objectives of the document were to:

a. Ensure that there is a collective understanding of the test activities, terms
and responsibilities across Post Office.

b. Provide details to key Post Office business stakeholders of Post Office’s
test strategy (per programme or project) which will provide confidence to
the Post Office business. The purpose of this was to put in place a robust
process when Horizon changes are deployed into the production
environment.

e. Obtain sign-off from key Post Office business stakeholders that the
testing approach/plan is achievable, and responsibilities of testing

activities are understood.

417. As part of the outcome of this work, Post Office recognised the need for a
consistent and common list of thresholds for BEDs. This list was required to
ensure that following a risk analysis to identify the potential severity and impact
of identified BEDs, a consistent and objective approach was adopted to setting
limits on the volume of BEDs that would be within the specified tolerances (as
defined in the Quality Assurance Test Strategy referred to above) at each stage
of the process.

418. This methodology now forms part of the Post Office Quality Assurance Test
Strategy which all projects across Post Office are encouraged, pursuant to Post

Office’s Change Excellence Framework, to follow when conducting testing.

Page 213 of 255
Demand and Change

WITN03680200
WITNO03680200

419. Should a change not demonstrate that it can meet the specified thresholds, it

will not be implemented within the live platform so as to maintain the overall

integrity the system.

420. Where a change has not been implemented in this way, or if testing has
separately led to the identification of BEDs, further testing will then be carried

out until such time as the change can demonstrate it does meet the requisite

thresholds.

421. As a change progresses through testing, the BED thresholds are examined

at each stage as illustrated below.

stace2 stAces staces uot

422. This provides Post Office with an objective metric-based confidence in relation
to the Horizon solution which has been provided by Fujitsu and a basis for Post
Office’s Horizon Testing Team to continually review and assess future changes
that may be proposed or deployed to Horizon.

423. Once the change has reached the stage where it is to be applied to the live

system, the details of any BED that has been assessed as being within the

Page 214 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

specified tolerances of BEDs that can be within a system at any one time is
published to Postmasters in the same way as any BED that is identified through
the live operation, for example, if a BED were reported by a Postmaster. These

BEDs then follow the Defect Management Process that I describe further below.

Testing: Implementation of supporting systems for the recording of testing
activity

424. As part of the work that has been carried out since 2022 which I have
described above, Post Office has adopted standard systems for the tracking of
testing and the recording of any BEDS identified during testing. This ensures
BEDs can be managed consistently using one common tool, as opposed to the
multiple Excel spreadsheets and disparate processes that were used
previously.

425. During the preparation for the testing of any proposed change to the Horizon
system, test scripts are created that detail the testing and checks that will be
executed at each stage of the testing. The results of the tests are then recorded
within the Jira tool that I will describe further below and which can be used in
order to track progress, as well as to provide an audit trail of issues identified

during testing.

Analysis of Historic BEDs

426. The first stage of the Remediation Programme also examined the status of

historic BEDS that were specifically referred to in the HlJ.*'” Detail was

417 POL00337564: Horizon Review Report v4.2 Final.pdf

requested from Fujitsu that enabled Post Office to conduct an analysis of these
BEDs. This was provided in the form of a report. #1

427. A series of joint workshops were then held with Fujitsu staff which resulted in
a detailed analysis of the status of these BEDs in the current version of Horizon.

The analysis determined that:

a. Out of 63 historical KELs, 46 could be closed as the core system and
functionality had extensively changed since these occurred, and thus the
specific problems that had been experienced could not occur again.

b. Of the remaining 17 KELs, Post Office and Fujitsu determined that 3 had
been resolved and 14 required retesting, to validate they no longer
existed within the platform.

c. 3 of the 14 remaining KELs which were the subject of reports made by
individual Postmasters and had _ insufficient detailed technical
information to determine what caused the issue or what business
process they related to. No further action could be taken in respect of
these.

d. Testing of the remaining 11 KELs was successfully completed by Post
Office confirming these to have been fixed and no longer prevalent in

Horizon.

428. The outcome of testing of the remaining 11 KELs is detailed in the Historic
KELs Closure Report (which refers to all the KELs described above)*'° and this
report has been shared with Postmasters and the Postmaster IT Working

Group. This was an initiative through which Post Office sought the opinions of

Postmasters in relation to proposed improvements to the Horizon system and
to seek their input in relation to areas in which there could be further

improvements.

Management, Rectification and reporting Of BEDs

The Defect Management Process

429. As Part of the Remediation Programme work described above, from February
2020 onwards, there have been a number of updates to the process for

managing BEDs within Horizon which can be summarised as follows:

a. The process for the capture and reporting of BEDS and other system
errors has been enhanced to ensure that all BEDS identified via testing
or via a report from a user (such as a Postmaster, a member of their staff
or a Branch Manager who might be conducting a visit to a branch) of the
Horizon system are logged in the Post Office service management tool
(“ServiceNow”). The purpose of this is to ensure they are visible and
the progress towards resolution can be monitored.

b. This monitoring is carried out at a weekly Defect Management Forum.
Since January 2021, these meetings have been chaired by Post Office
and are attended by representatives from Fujitsu together with internal

teams from the Post Office**°business. At those meetings, every open

420 The required attendees for these meetings were: Post Office -Branch Resilience Manager, Head of
Horizon Live Services, Senior Service Manager IT Retail, Branch Technology Defects Lead, BRT
Operations Manager Branch Reconciliation Team and the Head of the Branch Operations Engagement
Team. From Fujitsu, the Defect and Quality Manager was in attendance and Service and Technical
Management staff were in attendance from all suppliers.

WITN03680200

BED is reviewed for progress, including those that have had a fix
identified and are awaiting their scheduled release, those under
development and any in respect of which a solution is still being sought.
The information that is considered at these meetings will have been
captured via ServiceNow but will also have been reported to the meeting
separately by the Branch Support Centre (“BSC”) and ITSD (as
described further below).

(om An article for publication to Postmasters is created informing all branches
of the new BED and this is published on BranchHub within 48 hours of
identification. If the BED has the potential for financial impact, Post

Office 's legal team are also advised.

430. The Post Office BSC and ITSD are what I would describe as level one support
and are the first point of contact into which users can report problems with
Horizon. Both BSC and ITSD are notified of all new problems via the Branch
Resiliency Manager.

431. Every update to the record created in ServiceNow is timestamped and all
actions and minutes are captured against the record, along with all evidence of
any email exchanges, closure notes, supplier updates and test validation sign-

off.

432. All problems that have been resolved through the Defect Management
Process go through a closure approval process which involves consultation with
each of the attendees at the Forum described above prior to being closed.
There must be approval from each attendee before a resolved problem can be

closed.

Page 218 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

433. Post Office measures the success of the Defect Management Process
through a series of key performance indicators, such as how quickly branches
are advised of problems and how quickly ServiceNow records are raised.

434. A new Executive level report has been introduced and is published monthly
to the Post Office Legal team, the Retail Operations Team and senior leaders
within the Post Office records.4#"

435. The overall Defect Management Process and the steps taken by Post Office
was reviewed by KPMG in June 2021. 42

436. In the KPMG report following that review, KPMG commented that:

a. “The Problem Management process area has been a focus area within
Post Office over the past 12 months. A detailed process has been
implemented along with the relevant roles and responsibilities to deliver
the process and is triggered by a Major Incident or escalated incident.
Work is proactively underway to continue to drive improvement in the
implementation of the process.”

b. “There is no universally required project management tooling in place,
and some projects are managed via spreadsheets and email, whereas
other projects are using an implementation of Jira just for the delivery of

that project.”

c. “There seems to be no overarching tool in place to facilitate the delivery
of a) project change or b) test management, which causes inefficient
control and coordination of change management. Similarly, there is no
coordination of metrics, MI, and reporting, and so the governance of
each project will be different, and more complex, than if there was a

prescribed tool which had to be used for project management.”

437. I will address the work that Post Office has undertaken to address these
comments from KPMG further below.

438. Other network errors and system failures are also managed pursuant to the
Defect Management Process. The process for managing major incidents, which
means any event that may be related to a failure in the network or other system
issue, is kept under review and the latest version was produced in July 2023. 42°
That process sets out the steps to be taken once Post Office becomes aware
of a major incident (either through our system monitoring, a report from a
supplier or from a branch via the service help desk).

439. Key elements of the major incident process include:

a. Rapid assessment of the event to determine its severity (including the

impact on branches and their ability to trade).

b. Triage of the issue and identification of the steps that are required to
remediate.
c. Drafting communications to issue to branches/Post Masters in order to

ensure that they are aware of the issue.

423 POL00337591: Major Incident Management SOP Version 1.1 (2).docx

Page 220 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

440. Once the steps detailed above have been completed, the incident will be
managed through records created in ServiceNow, which facilitates the clear
tracking of the progress of the process and the auditability of the steps taken to
address the major incident. If necessary, a record detailing any underlying
problem that led to the major incident will be created and linked to that incident.
This record will then be reviewed as part of the Defect Management Process,

as described above.

Assessing the impact on branches of BEDS and wider system failures on branch

accounts

441. In order to understand the impact of a BED or wider system failures on branch
accounts, a step was added to the Defect Management Process that requires
a meeting to be held within 48 hours of the reporting of a significant type of
incident that I have described above (whether a BED or a system problem)

which has the potential to impact on branch accounts.

442. This meeting is attended by the relevant supplier for the service areas that
Post Office believes have been impacted by the issue (the supplier would
primarily be Fujitsu), representatives from the Post Office IT Horizon Operations
Team and Retail Operations Team and the National Federation of Sub-
Postmasters (“NFSP”) representatives who are invited to build understanding
of the issue or incident concerned.

443. The overall aim of this meeting is to consider any initial workarounds or

potential resolutions for the issue that has been identified, and to gather enough

Page 221 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

information for investigation and effective communication regarding that issue

to take place.

444. Each BED is categorised as either having the potential to have a financial
impact to a branch or could lead to a poor experience for a branch. A criticality
score is also allocated to help understand the potential impact of the BED,
whether that be on operational capabilities or branch functioning. This enables
the Horizon IT Operations team to allocate priority and sequence the timing of

fixes.

Establishing more robust governance in Horizon BED Tracking & Resolution

445. Post Office has also introduced improved processes to ensure that BEDs,
once identified, are tracked and monitored through to resolution.

446. Post Office uses a number of tools to improve its processes in relation to the
monitoring and tracking of BEDs and other service failures, in line with industry

best practice. This includes:

a. Service Now - Post Office utilises the ServiceNow platform for the
execution of a number of our IT Service Management processes.
ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that specialises in IT Service
Management & Operations. This is the tool through which, as I have
described above, all BEDs are logged.

b. Jira - A software package designed to support the tracking and
management of BEDs throughout the testing process that I have
described above. This tool will also contain test artefacts, scripts and test

results.

Page 222 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

447. Cross-checking does occur between the systems, but this is not currently

automated, which means the two systems cannot yet talk directly to each other .
Instead, some of the process is automated and some of it requires manual
linking up of tickets and progress. Post Office intends to further mature the use
of these tools with an ultimate goal of greater levels of automation. This will
provide greater opportunities to identify and predict trends in defects and quality
management meaning Post Office is better able to monitor the Horizon system
and take appropriate action when issues are identified. This work is part of the
response to the issues raised in the KPMG report of June 2021 that I refer to

above.

448. All BEDs in the live system are now, once identified, logged in ServiceNow.

This ensures progress and activity can be tracked and governed by Post
Office’s Horizon Live Service Team in one central location, which ensures a
complete audit trail. The head of the Horizon Live Service Team and anyone
else within Post Office who has responsibility for aspects of the ServiceNow

monitoring process has access to the system.

449. A common set of definitions are then used in ServiceNow to categorise the

status and progress of the defect as efforts are made to try and resolve it, which

I have detailed below.

450. The weekly meetings of the Defect Management Forum play a key role in this

improved governance. The Forum's meetings are coordinated by the Branch

Technology BEDs Lead, who acts as a single point of contact within Post Office

to track, manage and prioritise resolution of a BED that has been identified.

This was a new role that was recruited into Post Office’s Horizon Live Service

Team. This represents another significant and positive change from previous

practices which were not managed directly by Post Office. Post Office are now

Page 225 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

engaged at both a strategic management level and at an operational level in
the tracking, monitoring and resolution of BEDs.

451. Forum attendees are asked to assess the potential impact of the identified
BED by completing a criticality scoring matrix, which I have included below.
This helps to provide a clear prioritisation for the BED, and its level of urgency

so work to resolve it can be organised accordingly.

A practical example of the improvements to testing implemented by Post Office:

Recovery scripts

453. In order to assist the Inquiry in understanding the improvements to Post Office
's testing of the Horizon system in practice, I include, as an example, the
approach that has been adopted in relation to the Horizon Recovery Scripts.

454. Recovery scripts provide Horizon with the steps needed to ensure that in the
event, for example, of a loss of connectivity or loss of power, the counter is
returned to the stage of a transaction that was being progressed prior to the
interruption to processing. An example of this would be, when a Postmaster is
processing a Forex transaction and there is a loss of connectivity or power. In
that instance, as monies may already have been paid by a customer pursuant
to the transaction, the purpose of the Recovery Script would be to ensure that
the Postmaster’s counter, when connectivity is re-established, is returned to the

exact point in the transaction that it was at prior to the loss of connectivity.

455. In January 2022, whilst testing a new element of Horizon, the i-movo voucher
encashment functionality, which allows branches to use digital vouchers for
benefit payments made via the Horizon Counter, the Horizon Testing team
identified a problem with the Recovery Script that had been in place. The
purpose of that Recovery Script had been to make sure this process worked

correctly in the case of a systems communications or power failure. As a result,

Page 229 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

the problem with that Recovery Script could have resulted in the counter failing
to return (as in the example of the Forex transaction I have given above) to the
exact point in the transaction that occurred prior to the loss of connectivity.

456. Exploratory testing was, therefore, carried out on a number of Recovery
Scripts, as a result of which it was determined that it was necessary to make a
change to a piece of software called the Branch Access Layer (BAL). The BAL
had been developed by Fujitsu to ensure i-movo transactions on the Horizon
Counter worked correctly but had yet to be activated. The output from this
exploratory testing was reviewed by the Horizon Solution Authority which is the
governance forum within Post Office responsible for oversight of Horizon
Design Changes.

457. The issue was promptly escalated via the Horizon Defect Management
Process with a recommendation to review all Recovery Scripts to identify
whether further defects existed. This also included validating any possible
associated financial detriments or operational impacts to Postmasters. This
was because a number of the scripts supported transactions with a cash value
and therefore had the potential to cause discrepancies in branches if they failed

to operate as required.

458. It was identified by the Horizon Solution Authority within Post Office that,
whilst making the proposed change to the BAL would resolve the immediate
issue with the i-movo Recovery Script, it could potentially also lead to scripts
used to support other payment transactions on the Horizon Counter for
products such as Drop & Go, Smart Metering and MoneyGram being affected,
exposing Post Office and Postmasters to similar operational risks.

Approximately 53 Recovery Scripts also supported transactions with a cash

Page 230 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

value, so there was the possibility that this issue could result in branch
discrepancies and financial detriment if they failed to operate as required.

459. To understand the extent of the issue, the Horizon testing team carried out a
sample regression test on 20 scripts. Regression testing is the re-testing of
targeted IT system functionality to ensure that any existing functionality has not
been impacted by any changes made in or to the functionality. There is a suite

of approximately 900 tests that are run during this process.

460. Through analysis of the results of this sample testing, it was determined it was
likely that some of the Recovery Scripts had never performed the appropriate
recovery actions they were intended to perform. It was agreed therefore that
further testing needed to be performed to fully validate this possibility and
identify all impacted Recovery Scripts.

461. Whilst initially identifying some 152 Recovery Scripts as being potentially
impacted, further analysis confirmed 88 of the scripts to be obsolete and not
linked to any extant processes, reducing the number to 64. A script was
deemed to be obsolete if it either related to a business process that was no
longer used by Post Office or supported the same recovery process as another
script already in use.

462. Where multiple scripts were identified to be performing the same recovery
steps, it was identified that this was likely to be due to historic changes to
business processes or removal of functionality, without the legacy script having
been updated or removed.

463. Testing of the remaining 64 Recovery Scripts was carried out by the Horizon
Testing team from March to August 2022. This was a particular cycle of testing

which, to be executed effectively, needed to simulate loss of connectivity and

Page 231 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

power at appropriate points in the transaction to ensure the script performed as
expected. This cycle of testing also now forms part of the overall testing
approach for any changes or new functionality that is deployed by Post Office
IT in relation to the Horizon system.

464. These steps provided a worked example of how more robust Horizon testing
processes enabled the issue with Recovery Scripts to be promptly identified,

understood and managed by the Horizon testing team.

uestion 4(c): Changes or improvements made to any internal or external
measures _to_ monitor Fujitsu's compliance with the Relevant Contractual

Obligations since 17 December 2019

465. The HlJ identified concerns with the extent to which Post Office was reliant
on Fujitsu for the management of Horizon and that Post Office had limited
control and oversight, from a contractual perspective, on the day to day running
of the system.

466. As a result, since the HlJ, Post Office 's IT Commercial Team has been
leading an initiative to review existing arrangements, from a commercial
perspective, that are in place with Fujitsu and third parties. The purpose of this
initiative has been to enhance the working relationship and improve the
robustness of the oversight of Fujitsu’s engagement and compliance with the
contractual obligations, in order to ensure and effectively support the smooth
delivery of Horizon operations.

467. The work that has been progressed pursuant to this initiative can be

summarised as follows:

Page 232 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

a. Maintaining the Horizon Agreement with Fujitsu in line with the Post
Office 's Contract Management Framework which came into force in
2020.44

b. Embedding a robust Horizon IT Commercial Governance model to
manage and maintain Fujitsu and other third parties which provide
Horizon services to Post Office.

c. Working with teams across Horizon IT Services to identify a key set of
Policies, Standards and Frameworks summarising the Horizon
Services that Post Office provides to Postmasters and colleagues.

468.1 have detailed the work carried out pursuant to each of the workstreams

detailed at (a)-(c) above below.

The Codified Agreement within Post Office’s Contract Management Framework

469. The Codified Agreement outlines the services which Fujitsu are contractually
required to provide to Post Office in order to maintain and support the Horizon
system.4?° The Codified Agreement is managed in accordance with the
principles and standards of the Post Office Contract Management Framework
(as referred to above). This Framework sets out a series of internal controls
and operational standards that apply to a supplier management lifecycle, as

outlined below, which Post Office Contract Managers must adhere to.

July 1999. FUJ00000071.

Page 233 of 255
WITN03680200
WITNO03680200

470. Through effective and consistent management of suppliers (including Fujitsu)
pursuant to the Post Office Contract Management Framework Lifecycle, Post
Office has sought to ensure more effective contract management by taking the

following steps in relation to all contractual suppliers:

a. Ensuring ongoing compliance with contractual provisions (see further
below).
b. Effectively delivering contracts at or under the agreed costs and rates

and identifying savings and revenue opportunities throughout the

contract management process.

[os Efficiently introducing new suppliers via an onboarding process (which,
in summary is when a new contractual supplier starts providing
services to Post Office) as well as managing the end of a contract
through an exit process (when that supplier ceases to supply services
to Post Office) to ensure continuation of products or services with a
minimum impact on customers. Contract Managers within Post Office
are responsible for the creation of an Exit Strategy. All contracts
should, as good practice, include an Exit Schedule which should

include obligations to produce (and keep updated), by way of example,

Page 234 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

a draft Exit Plan, to assist with the transition of the relevant service to
the next provider.

d. Maximising outcomes to Post Office by the ongoing management of
contractual performance, reducing the likelihood of disruption to

services to the business, contractual disputes, or reputational damage.

Post Office Horizon IT Commercial Governance

471. Previously, the services provided by Fujitsu pursuant to the Codified
Agreement were monitored through the contractual governance schedule

which is contained within Schedule A2 of the Codified Agreement.*?°

472. However, as part of the Remediation Programme work that I have referred to
above, a governance structure now exists, the purpose of which is to maintain
and review the Horizon IT Services which Fujitsu provide pursuant to the
Codified Agreement. This governance structure in so far as both Post Office
and Fujitsu are concerned is continually reviewed by the Horizon Commercial
and Contract Management Team to ensure that it is fit for purpose.

473. Prior to the HlJ, there was already in place a series of monthly meetings with
Fujitsu ("the Fujitsu meetings") which covered a variety of topics and issues to
ensure that Fujitsu were acting in compliance with their obligations pursuant to
the Codified Agreement. These meetings included discussions regarding the

requirement to maintain continuity of service with Fujitsu whilst New Branch IT

WITNO03680200

— the new system platform which will replace Horizon - came online, reducing

any impact to operations during this transitionary period.

474. As part of the Remediation Programme work, Post Office’s Horizon IT team
scheduled weekly meetings (to supplement the monthly more general
contractual meetings described above) to ensure that operational discussions
could take place between IT specialists within Post Office and Fujitsu regarding
Fujitsu’s performance in relation to the relevant contractual obligations and to
track Fujitsu’s progress on a weekly basis. Matters discussed at these weekly
meetings would and continue to be fed into the monthly contractual meetings .

475. I have included below a table that shows how the management of the Fujitsu
contractual relationship sits within the broader Post Office Supplier Relationship

Governance Model and the associated meetings that take place.

477. \n addition to the Fujitsu meetings that are described above, Post Office’s
Horizon IT team also identified two additional opportunities to ensure better

working and service delivery by Fujitsu. These opportunities were the creation

of:
a. A process of Commercial Governance Continual Improvement; and
b. An internal review of Horizon Service Frameworks, Policies and

Standards.

Commercial Governance Continual Improvement

478. As I have detailed above, the weekly Defects Management Forum has been
an important governance mechanism which has assisted in raising awareness
of BEDs with Fujitsu and Post Office stakeholder groups and ensure all open
BEDs are managed and resolved.

479. From a commercial governance perspective, the Horizon Live Services Team
(in its capacity as part of the Defect Management Process that I have described
above) worked closely with the Horizon IT Commercial & Contract Management
team to review the terms of reference of the weekly Forum meeting. This
ensured Fujitsu understood the changes to ways of working and the associated
impact on BED management but that control in relation to the associated

process remained, as I have described above, within Post Office.

480. In February 2022, Post Office 's Horizon Commercial & Contract Management

Team

conducted an internal review of the frameworks, policies and standards

in place across each of the Horizon IT service areas within Post Office. This

exercise consisted of the following work strands:

a.

Compiling a list of frameworks and policies across Post Office Horizon

IT on how each of the teams operate, their purpose and objectives*?’.

Identifying a key set of standards summarising the Horizon Services

that Post Office provides to postmasters and colleagues.

Reviewing the processes and tools that Horizon IT teams use internally,
as well as those which are delivered by Fujitsu to manage the smooth

running of Horizon operations.

481. A large volume of documents was reviewed to develop one consistent source

of information for the Framework Policies and Standards underpinning Fujitsu's

delivery of Horizon IT services to Post Office.4?° This work was conducted in

482. Where arrangements or processes that I have described above as having

been introduced from 2019 onwards remain in force within Post Office, I have

made that clear.

483. However, in addition to those arrangements or processes, additional

monitoring of Fujitsu's compliance with the Relevant Contractual Obligations

(as defined in Rule 9(48)) has and continues to be achieved through Post

Office's Horizon Solution Authority (which I have described briefly above). This

acts as an important check and balance through which all proposed changes

to Horizon must be successfully approved before any changes are progressed.

The members of the Horizon Solution Authority team within Post Office who are

responsible for monitoring Fujitsu’s compliance hold a variety of technical IT

qualifications which are set out in detail in documentation associated with an

internal audit that was carried out of Post Office IT staff's qualifications

484. I have described above in answer to Question 4(d)(i), how the process for the
management, rectification and reporting of BEDs in Horizon has been reviewed
and revised and how it currently operates so as to ensure that it effectively
monitors Fujitsu’s performance in relation to the relevant contractual obligations

and the existence and requirement to rectify BEDs that may be identified.

Question 4)d)iii) The use of access rights and privileges by Fujitsu employees

to remedy errors in transaction data and branch accounts

485. The improvement of Horizon security processes and protocols has been a key
area of focus for the Horizon Issues Remediation Programme. This work has

been progressed through improvements in the following areas:

a. Horizon Data Centre Security Reporting & Reviews - This is an
ongoing monitoring process of the physical and technical measures in
place to maintain security in Horizon Data Centres.

b. Horizon Global & SMART ID Account Reviews - These are reviews of
the allocation of access to Horizon provided via Global and SMART IDs
to ensure that access is appropriate and remains relevant to and
necessary for the roles of the individuals who have been granted that

access.

c. Cloud Security — This ensures that non-physical Post Office data
centres are protected with the same levels of security as physical data
centres.

d. External Independent Benchmarking, including Horizon Security
Penetration Testing & Horizon Security Audit - Both of these processes

are the responsibility of an external supplier outside of Post Office and

Fujitsu called Nettitude. Nettitude provide reporting to Post Office to

address the points detailed above.*°°

486. The overall aim of this work has been to give Post Office and Postmasters
more confidence in relation to who is accessing Horizon, when and for what

purposes.

Horizon Data Centre Security Reporting & Reviews

487. The following processes have been reviewed and improvements have been
implemented that have increased the robustness and transparency of access

to the maintenance functions associated with the management of the Horizon

platform.

488. Whilst carrying out this work, Post Office has also taken the opportunity to
initiate additional value add activities. These were not within the original remit
of the work carried out pursuant to the Remediation Programme but have

assisted in further enhancing the robustness of Horizon.

Fujitsu remote access solution

489. Work is ongoing to upgrade the Fujitsu remote access solution which is a
software package called Cygwin, through which Fujitsu can access the Horizon
counter within branch in order to maintain elements of the Horizon system. As
a first step in this work, a study has been commissioned to determine options
for the current End of Service Life (EOSL) component — a key element of the
existing remote access solution.

490. Due to the age of the component, it cannot be automatically upgraded to the
latest version. The study is therefore assessing how the upgrade can take place
whilst keeping the Horizon Counter secure and providing Fujitsu with the

minimum level of access that they require to provide continued support.

Page 248 of 255
WITNO3680200
WITN03680200

491.The remote access solution was upgraded in 2023 to protect against
vulnerabilities and further restrict the resources on counter devices that Fujitsu
have access to. This product allows Fujitsu users to connect via Secure Shell**
to the counter device and run scripts which allow the retrieval of log information.
This method of connection does not allow a Fujitsu user direct control of the

desktop or application within a branch.

492. Any remote access, should it ever need to be required, needs pre-approval
from senior Fujitsu management, Post Office’s Horizon IT and Retail
Operations Teams and also requires the involvement of the relevant
Postmaster. Any use of these capabilities, which is extremely rare, is
retrospectively analysed by the Post Office Horizon Technology Risk and

Security team to ensure that all approval steps were followed.

Horizon Global & SMART ID Account Reviews

493. Post Office needs to ensure, so that it can effectively manage remote access
to Horizon, that it has robust processes in place to monitor user accounts. By
doing so, Post Office will have assurance that accounts are up to date and
being used for the purposes they were intended for. The following initiatives

have been delivered within Post Office in support of this requirement:

494. A subsequent review of Global ID Privileges was also initiated to assess which
privileges were associated to each of the Global ID Roles. This followed a "least
privilege" principle whereby each Global ID user would only be assigned the

specific privileges needed to fulfil the duties of their role. The findings and

Page 250 of 255

outcome of the review were made available in Quarter 1 of the 2023 financial

year*®?.

495. Regular meetings between Post Office and Fujitsu to review Privileged and

remote access management initiatives have also been established. These

meetings are a key part of the overall ISMF within Post Office that is attended

by representatives from Fujitsu and which I will describe in more detail in my

response to question 3 of the Rule 9 request.

Cloud Security

496. There are some further initiatives that have also been instigated within Post

Office in an effort to improve the security and access privileges associated with

asmall amount of Horizon applications which Fujitsu support and have already

migrated to the Post Office Cloud, which I have detailed further below. Work

has also been done to update documentation around Appsup which is a

process that is used by Post Office to ensure any elevated privileges required

by Fujitsu to support applications they are responsible for in the Post Office

Cloud are approved by Post Office before access is granted. These are as

follows:

protocols (that relate to issues such as physical system security) in so far as

systems access is concerned. These initiatives were as follows:

put in place with Fujitsu to address, as a priority, critical and medium level
issues that have been identified.

499. As an additional value-add activity, an analysis of the Horizon Counter set up
within Post Office Counter Training Offices was commissioned and has been

carried out*®* which focused on assessing whether the correct security
