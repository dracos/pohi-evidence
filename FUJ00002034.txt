The Message Broadcast Service enables Post Office to communicate directly with
Branches, for the purposes of issuing instructions, advice or information urgently,
where paper and postal communications may be too slow or inappropriate. The
Message Broadcast Service only enables communications from Post Office out to
Branches; Branches are unable to respond or communicate to Post Office using this
Service.

Fujitsu Services will enable the distribution of Messages to selected user groups at
targeted Branches on receipt of a request from Post Office.

Each Message will be distributed to all the selected user groups and target Branches,
both as identified by Post Office.

Certain proscribed characters are not supported by the Message Broadcast Service
and cannot be used within the Message text. These are defined in detail in the
Working Document entitled: “Message Broadcast Service, Joint Working
Document” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0005).

Only Branches that are currently in communication with the HNG-X Central
Infrastructure at the time of the Message Broadcast will be able to access the
Message.

HNG-X
Service Definition

Process

For each Message Post Office requests to be broadcast, Post Office shall ensure the
Message (which covers the Message title and text) is conformant with the
specifications described within section 2.1.1.4 of this Message Broadcast Service,
Service Description.

For each Message Post Office will identify a list of the target Branches, the selected
user groups and the length of time the Message is to remain on the Message
Broadcast System after it has been read. Specifically, the control information
provided by Post Office with each Message shall include the following:

(a) Message title (up to 18 characters, including embedded spaces);
(b) Message priority (high or low);
(c) Message retention period (one (1) day);

(d) detail of the targeted Branches (these may be specified by region, Branch type
or Branch identification code); and

avoidance of doubt, “ANY” does not include users groups 'ENGINEER' or
‘SUPPORT & SETUP’ which are not part of the Message Broadcast Service
available to Post Office.

Where a Message relates to the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or
processes surrounding the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities, Fujitsu
Services shall verify the technical accuracy of the details within the Message where
possible.

Fujitsu Services will further verify that the Message conforms to the following criteria:

(a) no proscribed characters (as referred to in section 1.4 of this Message
Broadcast Service, Service Description) are used;

(b) no graphics, tables or text formatting (such as bold type, bullet points,
underlining or italic script) are used;

(c) the text does not include any leading spaces;
(d) _ the title does not exceed 18 characters in length, including any spaces used;

(ec) _ the overall Message length does not exceed 1670 characters, including spaces,
Service Desk details and any contact name but excluding control information
(as referred to in section 2.1.1.2 of this Message Broadcast Service, Service
Description);

(f) _ the retention period of I (one) day or greater, as requested by Post Office; and

(g) the Message indicates where applicable, whether any Branch queries should be
addressed to the Service Desk or the Post Office Network Business Support
Centre (NBSC)

Where necessary, Fujitsu Services will liaise directly with Post Office to obtain
suitable amendments to a Message before it is broadcast to ensure compliance with
the criteria in section 2.1.1.4 of this Message Broadcast Service, Service Description.

Fujitsu Services will provide a daily report to Post Office of Branches which may not
have been able to receive Messages during the previous day due to a communications
failure within the Branch Infrastructure or the HNG-X Central Infrastructure.

Fujitsu Services can propose Messages for Message Broadcast to Post Office, but the
final authority for wording and release lies with Post Office. However, where Fujitsu
Services notifies Post Office that a Message is of an urgent nature and is required to
restore Service or avoid further loss of a Service within one or more Branches, Post
Office and Fujitsu Services will agree the distribution of the Message in accordance
with the Service Management Service. Post Office shall ensure that the final authority
for release of this Message is not unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Reading Messages in a Branch

Users will be able to access Messages delivered to a Branch from any Counter
Position for the period specified as the Message’s retention period (as referred to in
section 2.1.1.2 of this Message Broadcast Service, Service Description).

Only Users who are members of the user group selected for each Message (as
referred to in section 2.1.1.2 of this Message Broadcast Service, Service Description)
will be able to access all or any part of that Message.

Messages shall be automatically deleted from the HNG-X Central Infrastructure once
their retention period has expired.

When a User of an appropriate user group is logged onto a Business Capability or a
Support Facility and a Message is stored for that user group, the Business Capability
or Support Facility shall indicate that a Message is available.

The Business Capability or Support Facility shall allow each User to view the
Messages stored for those user groups of which the User is a member. When viewing
a Message the User shall be informed of the creation date of the Message, its priority
and whether that Message has been displayed for that User previously. When the
message window is activated by the User, the Messages shall be displayed in the
sequence:

(a) never previously displayed, high priority;

(b) _ never previously displayed, low priority;

(c) _ previously displayed, high priority; and

(d) previously displayed, low priority.

If necessary, the User will be able to scroll backwards or forwards to view each
Message in turn.

New Messages arriving whilst the message window is active will be appended to the
top of the list regardless of priority.

Messages received by Branches can be printed on the counter printer at the Counter
Position if this is required.

The Message Broadcast Service is available during the hours of: 08:00hrs to 20:00hrs,
