6. ‘Agents’ Remuneration

Debbie Smith provided an overview of the paper. The development of the retail strategy had
originally been discussed by the Board in July 2018 since when the Common Issues Trial Judgment
had been issued, the Select Committee hearing on the Post Office network had taken place and calls
for increases in agent remuneration had increased. The fragility of the network, the struggle to
attract new postmasters and churn all supported the need review agent remuneration. An additional
£17m funding into the network had already been announced, largely linked to the increased
transaction fees supported by Banking Framework 2. We had already communicated that there
would be further announcements on agents’ pay in November 2019.

The executive had been discussing options and were moving to the view that we should be spending
a further £20m now and retaining £10m for potential further spend which might to link to incentives
for postmasters. This was seen as a minimum requirement to stabilise the network in the short term
pending a more thorough review. The proposals had been informed by insight from 50 postmasters
from different parts of the network. We were attempting to focus the most benefit in the right
places.

A number of points were raised, including:

* were the proposals sufficiently targeted at securing our desired outcome of stabilising the
network? To what extent was this a network subsidy payment driven by wanting to avoid any
postmaster operating below the national minimum wage and to what extent something we were
funding to drive growth?

* there was a danger of trying to do too many small things (for example, spending money on store
standards) and careful design would be required to achieve the outcomes we wanted. It was
noted that we would need to measure the outcome of the investments and look at what was
going to provide sustainable value in the longer term

* our starting proposition appeared to be that we were paying postmasters too little but could this
be evidenced (for example, other franchises like PayPoint had much less generous arrangements
in place on the provision of equipment and we knew that we were overpaying for some
transactions)? An 8% increase in the overall bill was significant. It was reported that the adverse
feedback on remuneration/ value associated with running a Post Office was coming for our
multiples as well as individual postmasters

* how did the figures map across to the most vulnerable areas? We needed to remember that Post
Office created significant footfall for multiples like the Coop

* that the retail team was handicapped by a lack of data about branch profitability and the position
of our multiples. Employment costs were key and there was a step change in costs for agents if
they had to employ an additional employee

POST OFFICE LIMITED BOARD MEETING
Strictly Confidential and Subject to Legal Privilege - DO NOT FORWARD

* that we were not solving the issues systemically and there was nothing to stop ongoing requests
for additional funding when we were already failing to operate profitably

* that the proposals were focussed on stabilising the network over the next couple of years. Gaps
would emerge as Banking Framework volumes dropped. We needed to consider whether we
wanted to restructure the network

* that we still needed a deeper review on remuneration rates

‘* the paper needed to be clear whether any element of the remuneration increases were
dependent on BEIS funding

* _anefficiency lens would be helpful because our attractiveness as a franchise was not just about
remuneration but also about how we make things simpler for postmasters. It was noted that part
of PSG work was looking at the simplification of setting up and running a Post Office and linking
everything back to our attractiveness as a franchise

* we were working on the assumption that these measures would allow us to maintain the network
at its current level but could this be substantiated? It was noted that it was difficult to evidence a
“tipping point” that led to a postmaster leaving and if we had a better understanding of the
triggers this is what we would be targeting

‘© whether this work had been aligned with the work on Starling (workers’ rights case). It was
reported that this had been factored in, including when looking at potential arrangements for
leave cover

* we were not thinking sufficiently about the future shape of our network when setting postmaster
remuneration. We needed to strike a sustainable economic relationship with our postmasters
and could not yet identify the “tipping point” for leaving Post Office or for being an attractive
franchise proposition

* we were a franchise operation overlaid by a social purpose but we had to be clear that social
purpose linked to customers rather than postmasters

* the narrative and communications for the announcement on the additional investment and
agents’ remuneration would be critical.

Chairman’s summary:

The Board was concerned that we could be committing to investments which would not achieve the

desired outcome. There was a danger of a continuing demand for additional funds that we could not

afford. Agents’ remuneration and network stability needed to be analysed further. Post Office

needed to be attractive as a franchise and be able to attract the right postmasters but we did not

know enough about financial situation of postmasters. We needed to be paying the right fee for the

right transactions and understand the different segments of postmasters and the challenges they

faced. As a starting point the Board would like to see the workings behind the model. A/ NB

The Board APPROVED an additional £20m investment in agents’ remuneration and support for
changes which would be introduced from April 2020. The Board DELEGATED AUTHORITY to the
Group CEO and CFO to finalise the list of initiatives included. The Board APPROVED holding a further
£10m in the budget for potential additional spend on agents’ remuneration and support which might
include incentivising desired behaviours. Any additional spend would first need to be approved by
the Board. The Board APPROVED the announcement of the changes in November 2019.

It was noted that the Group Chief Executive would be briefing the Minister in advance of the public
announcement.

Payzone Bill Payments Limited
Strategy and Update

Debbie Smith introduced the paper, explained the drivers for the acquisition and how we were
looking at the network. Some income had been received later than expected, revenue from ticketing
was under performing and integration costs were higher than estimated. However, while the shape
of returns was different we anticipated that the benefits would be realised overall.

A number of points were raised, including:
© that a 7% growth in market share through a non-Royal Mail pick up and drop off service (PUDO)
seemed low? It was reported that the PUDO market comprised 160m items a year. We had

around a 33% market share with RM with click and collect

* what impact would buying Doddle have on POL systems? It was reported that Doddle would
work outside Horizon. It was an application that would sit on the Payzone network and would
drive footfall

* that the acquisition had been rational and we were making progress in gaining market share but
we still had to consider whether this was an area we wanted to invest in when considering our
other investment options if the quantum was small

* were we committed to signing the contract with British Gas? It was reported that we had not
made an announcement but the position was already known publically because PayPoint had
reported its loss of the contract

how did we think PayPoint’s business would develop?

* that POL could not risk reputational damage linked to the operation of the Payzone business.
Therefore, the business and the risks needed to be managed in the right way with accountability
resting with its Managing Director

* would we make additional money from the BG contract? What were the incremental economics?
It was reported that the British Gas contract was an enabler and facilitator for future contracts

we needed to understand the future value we would be creating and understand all the
opportunities owning the network provided us. It was thought that we might be underplaying
these opportunities. It was noted that future value depended in part on IT costs because
development of the service hinged on us moving to the cloud

* the Board was being asked to take decisions without a full understanding of all the moving parts,
such as IT costs and it not been clear when we were bidding for the acquisition that we would
need to invest more to win additional contracts. It was noted that the risks of not moving to the
cloud were significant and the worst case outcome would be to sign up to the BG contract and
then only use Horizon integration Hub (HiH) for this, We would need to take a commercial view
‘on future deals and also consider how PayPoint was likely to react to Payzone acquiring additional
market share.

It was AGREED that a better explanation of how the integration costs had been developed compared AG
to the business case approved by the Board when the acquisition was made would be provided.

IRRELEVAN

Telecoms Strategy

Owen Woodley introduced the paper. A decision was sought from the Board to allow Fujitsu to
submit a de-unified bid and accept the risks associated with this approach. We were not bound by
full PCR (Public Contract Regulation) requirements but the process needed to be fair and transparent.
There was a possibility that we accepted the risk and Fujitsu nevertheless dropped out of the process.
If they were to drop out we would face exit and migration costs to a new supplier although the cost
savings might be significant. A further paper would be brought to the November Board meeting
with an update on initial bids received.

Meredith Sharples noted that there was a reasonable prospect that we would decide to sell the
business but that we would have no indication of sale price for some while and would need Fujitsu’s
ongoing co-operation. We had the option of stopping the RFP at any time but needed to inform
Fujitsu what we intended to do by 17 February 2020. Timings would be communicated to the bidders
today and as early December 2019 potential bidders would be notified of intention to seek a possible
sale. Bidders would be informed that we were seeking to maximise the value of the business on sale.
The Board noted that an ongoing involvement for POL in telecoms should only be considered if there
was a compelling offer from one of the bidders.

Tom Cooper asked how robust our RFP process was. It was reported that the Telecoms Team had
worked closely with the procurement team on documenting the process.

The Board discussed the option of a possible extension to the current agreement with Fujitsu which
would be pursued, partly driven by the uncertainty on the timescales for Government approval to any
outcome

The Board APPROVED the acceptance of the procurement risk associated with inviting the submission
of a disaggregated bid and DELEGATED AUTHORITY to the CEO - FST& and the Telecoms Director to
make a counter offer to Fujitsu and invite them to make a disaggregated bid

Next Steps on the Digital Identity Strategy

Owen Woodley introduced the paper. The Board NOTED the proposed short term approach and
APPROVED a short-term extension with Digidentity, with sign-off of the terms delegated to the Group
CEO and CFO. The contract expired in November 2019 but there was an option of a one year
extension.

Group Litigation Update — subject to legal privilege

Ben Foat introduced the paper. The figures under consideration for the mediation would be discussed
at the Postmaster Litigation Subcommittee. We would need to make a reasonable offer? to show that
we were entering the mediation in good faith. Part 36 offers would be made if we were not
successful and we would then need to go to a second mediation. The Horizon Issues Trial judgment
would be issued shortly and we would receive 24 hours’ notice of the embargoed judgment being
released. An update on the known evidence logs (KELs) had been sent to the Board last weekend.
The Court hearing on leave to appeal was taking place on 12 November 2019 and if we were
successful the claimants were more likely to consider settlement. Mr Justice Fancourt had recently
ruled on the Sheffield United case and had disagreed with Mr Justice Fraser’s view on relational
contracts in the Common Issues Trial judgment.

A number of points were raised, including:

* we needed to look at the whole picture including what costs might be associated with the
convicted claimants. Delegated authority should be sought for the total mediation figure. Alan
Watts reported that it was not necessarily a question of making an offer but looking at the figures
based on a 12 month termination figure. We did not think the claimants’ solicitors would be in a
position to go through claimant by claimant and we were giving serious thought to what
information we could share on our analysis of the claimants’ cases without releasing all the work
we had done. Our limiting factor was what we thought we would pay if we went through a court
process, the other sides was their funding position. There was a potential to agree a number with
the claimants’ solicitors which covered all claimants and they could decide how to share this
money

* how would a mediator assess all of the elements of the case such as expectation damages and
stigma damages? It was reported that the mediator would have to look at the gap in the figures
between the two sides. The absence of clear figures from the claimants would make it difficult
for the mediator. The mediator’s role was to help each party see the case through the other's
lens

* we needed to reach a view on sums that might be associated with stigma damages and other
elements that were more difficult to define

* a review of convicted cases had been discussed at the last Postmaster Litigation Subcommittee
meeting, had any work taken place? BF reported that we were considering how this work might
be undertaken and by whom. Any consideration of reviewing how Post Office Limited dealt with

2 Post-meeting note: POL’s Articles of Association require that Shareholder consent is obtained for spend above
£50m. However, we have been advised that BEIS/ HMT’s view is, that in the case of settlement, approval would
be required for any figure. This is for a number of reasons, including that the potential settlement amount
being discussed is only for part of the claimant group and so the eventual number could exceed £50m and that
the expenditure could be considered to be “novel, contentious or repercussive” circumstances under which
Managing Public Money guidance requires prior approval to be sought.

the convicted cases would need to be discussed with Ministers. AW noted that we would have to
satisfy ourselves that we had enough information to make those judgement calls and we were
unlikely to have enough information to consider that before the mediation. The Horizon Issues
Trial judgment would be issued shortly and the criminal claimants’ position would need to be
considered in light of that. Individual payments could not be made to convicted claimants. TC
noted that the primary concern of the convicted claimants was for their conviction to be
overturned. It was noted that these claimants had been convicted through the courts and we
could only seek to offer help if we had information to suggest that any of these convictions were
unsound.

The Board NOTED the updates in the paper including the approach being taken to mediation. The
Board AUTHORISED the Postmaster Litigation Subcommittee to delegate to the General Counsel
authority to make settlement offers at mediation on terms to be determined by the Subcommittee.

11. Starling (Workers’ rights case) Update

The Board NOTED the approach, update and next steps. It was reported that we were satisfied with
the 10 lead witnesses and our understanding of the risks associated with each case. Our witnesses
would be prepared properly.

The Board DELEGATED decisions (including instructions on settlement receipt of making offers) for
Starling to the Group Chief Executive Officer, CEO Retail and General Counsel. Significant decisions
should be referred back to the Board.

12. Noting and governance items
12.1 Horizon integration Hub

The Board NOTED the intention to continue with the development of the Horizon integration Hub in
order to deliver the next set of features that ensured delivery of services at scale to the appropriate
service levels.

It was noted that approval for the development of RPos had been granted as it was required for the
delivery of the British Gas contract. Self Service Kiosk development proposals (SSKs) had not yet been
considered because a number of Horizon system issues had first to be determined.

Dangerous Goods ~— penalties for non-conformance

There is no contractually agreed target or an agreed target between the CAA, Royal
Mail and POL. The ethos followed has been to seek continual improvement by P12 of
each year. There is no indication that this will change in the immediate future but
rules around the movement of items are tending to become stricter rather than
looser.

There is no financial penalty for mystery shop failure but Royal Mail reserve the right
to withdraw the authority for individual branches to transact any sales of parcels in
the event of non-compliance. This has so far not been implemented as POL have been
able to demonstrate that once a branch is identified as not complying there is a
process to engage with them and provide refresher training so that Dangerous Goods
acceptance improves.

BOARD DISCUSSION PAPER

Group CEO Report - -

Author: Nick Read
Meeting date: 26 November 2019

In, Lik

The Board is invited to note the report and highlight any issues where a future
discussion would be welcome.

As referenced in last month’s report, and in light of some of my early observations
around driving accountability cross the business I have implemented a new operating
rhythm and meeting cadence which focuses on ensuring we have much more
emphasis and control around our delivery, costs, accountability and across our
product lines. This new model will take effect from w/c 18'" November and comprises
of the following:

« Weekly CEO Lead Team meeting - shorter and focused on the week ahead
and horizon scanning

e Weekly Trading & Business performance meeting - attendees are key product
owners and focus is purely on weekly sales and performance

e Monthly strategic GE meeting - key focus is strategic and forward looking
items, as well as key business and decisions with time for strategic forward
looking discussion

e L40 huddles —- renamed Leadership Council - now scheduled every fortnight,
as opposed to every three weeks. Key focus is groupwide issues across the
business as well as culture, purpose and ensuring cross functional alignment

e Monthly UK Operation meetings - key focus is lowering costs, delivery and
improving our productivity across our network

e¢ Monthly Customer Plan - key focus is improving our customer proposition and
strengthening our brand across the network

¢ 10@10 - a weekly all staff townhall huddle, on Wednesdays at 10am for 10
minutes. Key focus is on company performance and topical issues of the day
and an opportunity for me to answer questions from colleagues. Held
primarily in Finsbury Dials, but will be held in other locations across the year.
Each session will be filmed and highlights from the update will be uploaded
onto a dedicated intranet site and cascaded internally.

As part of this new model, a new engagement plan for GE and our Leadership Council
is being created, to ensure we rapidly increase and improve our interactions with
postmasters and spend more time outside Finsbury Dials, with our regional colleagues
and in our branches with customers. I will share more details about our plans at the
next Board meeting. As an example, December's GE meeting will be in Chesterfield
and all GE colleagues will be ‘on the road’ in Christmas week meeting Postmasters and
customers.

Financial & Cash Performance

Trading Profit for the month closed £0.9m ahead of budget on an underlying basis,
swinging YTD performance £0.4m ahead of budget. Against the 6+6 forecast we are
£1.6m ahead, but the full year 6+6 falls around £3m short of target, and so further out
performance is required. Areas of focus include; whether we have the right balance
between short term Telco pricing and sale price, whether the results in protection
insurance will change our view of that business and re-assessing the network to seek
to stay above 11,600 branches this year.

Cash. NRF funding has returned to normal levels in Period 7, therefore we have
decreased our borrowing from BEIS accordingly by £152m from prior period, closing
the period with the government loan facility utilisation at £588m.

Key Business updates

Network & Christmas planning

Network development programme is still on track. Year to date we have delivered 54
DMB exits and almost 150 new network locations helping to maintain our network of
around 11,600 branches. We are also on track to deliver 15 of the new parcel shop
locations before Christmas with 14 already delivered. Early indications are mixed
regarding number of parcels being handled each week. We are now conducting a full
review of the initial pilots to inform future plans especially around branding and
operational execution.

We have now concluded Project Edgware. 72 branches have been delivered to date
with the remaining 2 branches on hold due to lease issues between WHS and their
landlord. (Gloucester and Chelmsford). £5.6m annual benefits will be delivered each
year over the 10 year contract term. We expect to have around 120 DMBs remaining
at the end of March and following GE discussion our plans for 20/21 will be to divest
as many as we can. The McKinsey analysis highlights how significantly loss making
the estate is and we must accelerate the divestment next year.

We continue to build on our contingency planning across the business as the political
landscape remains uncertain. There are various options currently being developed
which would enable Post Office to respond quickly to any emergency service issues
created in the network as a result of the GLO outcome or the potential collapse of a
large retail partner.

Five additional mobile vans are in the process of being equipped and are on track to
be ready for use by the 25th November. Additionally, the ‘Post Office in a box’ solution
(a smaller footprint, quicker and cheaper means of local service provision) is also on
track to be tested in five pilot locations across the UK by early December, in areas
where we are currently experiencing service issues. Following the pilot and
refinement, we plan to use this new concept more widely across the network as a
contingency.

Launch of Captial One Credit Cards

We have successfully launched two new credit cards with Capital One, only four
months after signing the agreement. Our MVP went live online on 5'" November (soft
launch), with digital marketing following from the 12". So far, anecdotal feedback on
the customer experience has been positive; we will share the first performance
metrics next month. In parallel, we are working on delivering a small branch pilot in
Q4, driving a second release of journey enhancements, and building our customer
understanding to refine the proposition set and features from the current MVP.

New Identity proposition

We have initiated a trial in 15 branches for a tablet-based solution for Digital Check &
Send (DC&S) passport applications which will run until December. Unlike the existing
DC&S solution available in 700 branches with AEI booths, this will cover all passport
application types, not just adult renewals. Assuming the trial is successful, we will
then roll out the solution to c.1,500 branches during the first half of 2020, eventually
decommissioning the AEI service to reduce costs. Following the update provided at
the October Board, negotiations are underway for a short-term extension of our
contract with Digidentity, pending the conclusions of the wider strategy review to
determine if digital identity is one of our ‘big bets’.

Christmas planning

The Christmas Campaign landed in branches on the 11" of November and is centered
on the theme ‘It’s Post Office Season’. The marketing material comprises of posters
(for those branches with poster space available), leaflets, window vinyl and pin-pad
advertising.

We are supporting Postmasters and Area Managers with access to a central app for
social media content distribution. The app will store compliant, on-brand content that
Postmasters can easily post on their social media channels to drive engagement and
footfall to their branches. The initiative is in pilot with 500 app licenses and due to
launch before the Christmas period.

Banking Framework 2

BF2 is still fully on track to launch on January 1st 2020. Barclays have reversed their
decision, and we therefore have full 100% migration from BF1 to BF2. Following their
climb-down Barclays will now ‘agitate’ from the sides - including pressurising Govt
(HMT) and regulators (FCA) to put Post Office under tighter regulatory control and try
to galvanise other banks to highlight issues/raise ‘noise’ to underline their concerns
about the service (their main complaint being that we are - in their words - ‘semi-
monopolistic’ and now dominant). We are aware of this and are actively planning a
‘phase 2’ of our successful reversal campaign, to work with HMT and FCA, gain
assistance from BEIS and make sure any input from them is balanced and positive.
Our next step is to work with FCA and HMT to understand the regulatory umbrella and
to develop plans with BEIS, CA and others to ensure continued buy-in.

ATM's

We currently host just under 2,200 ATMs located across the Post Office network. Bol
has notified us that it is withdrawing from the ATM market, and we are working with
them towards a contract end date of March 2022 by which time all devices will have
been removed. Bol are beginning the process of removing out of licence devices,
however some of these we want to retain due to their profitability. This means that if
we intend to ‘remain’ we need to agree a retention package with Bol to avoid the
removal of ATMs that we want to keep. At this early stage we believe that the case to
‘remain’ in the ATM market is strong. Early financial analysis shows that remaining in
the market would generate £80m cash flow over an eight year period from 20/21,
compared to £14m if we exited the market. To help inform our decision making we
are undertaking an OJEU procurement process which is currently underway and on
track for completion in April 2020. We will update the board after Christmas and
deliver final recommendations in Q4 19/20.

British Gas

As you will be aware we have now signed the contract with British Gas securing an
exclusive 5.5yr deal to retain the service in Post Offices, include the addition of the
Payzone retail network, and remove the incumbent PayPoint service. The service will
go live in Payzone stores from 1%t December, with the full transition and exclusivity
effective on Jan 1st, 2020. The contract will generate 72m additional transactions p/a
and serve ~1.8m customers.

Paypoint have responded as expected, encouraging BG customers to move to other
energy providers & targeting Payzone agents around contract restrictions. British Gas
are considering how to respond as this is a breach of Paypoint’s current contract. We
are now stepping up our marketing and communications to both agents and
customers.

Agents’ Remuneration ~ well received

Following the announcement earlier this month of further increases to Agents’
Remuneration, we have been monitoring press coverage and postmaster feedback.
Postmaster feedback via Area Managers has been very positive in the vast majority of
cases inevitably wanting more detail and to understand the benefits for their
individual branches, but very welcoming and recognising this is meaningful and in the
right areas. The most prominent press was in the Daily Mail who led with a positive
headline about the amount, welcoming the increases and implying that they have
helped achieve this. This largely positive coverage, particularly using the 10%
increase as a lead, was the pattern in the other press coverage. Other articles have
appeared in Daily Mirror, Daily Record, Convenience Store, Talking Retail, The Grocer,
Asian Trader, Post & Parcel News, Retail Newsagent, Scottish Grocer and Convenience
Retailer. We will be writing to branches next week confirming the detail of the rate
changes and will update with further feedback following this.

Hothouse Programme

The Hot housing programme to develop capability of Area Managers and Postmasters
to drive improved performance, has extended to a further 3 regions and will be
activated in 700 branches by the end of November. Results from branches in the 1%
two phases show a positive uplift in revenue relative to the control group. We are now
building a case for an accelerated programme to be on the ‘big bets’ list. The principle
of optimising our existing operation is increasingly looking like the best strategic
option. This is a reflection on core capability, our capacity to deliver change and our
culture of initiating something new, when results are hard to extract.

Change project spend

In P7 the Investment Committee approved additional spend for 2 large programmes:
Branch Hub (Agent Self Service) and RPOS (technology for whole estate deals). We
are noting this for the board but not seeking formal approval until we have completed
the strategic review (PSG Project) to understand if these programmes are aligned with
the long term strategy. For the moment, the programmes have approval to spend
until January Board. Spend and deliverables are as follows:

o Branch Hub has spent £9.6m to P7 of their current approved £9.7m
spend. The programme forecast £1.9m additionally to the end of
January to complete in anticipation of a full adoption plan at the end of
Q4.

o RPOS has spent £2.9m to P7. The programme forecasts spending £1.9m
to the end of January to obtain 70% product completion built on HIH, a
fully configured paystation device and clear Heads of Terms for The Co-
Op Group

Risks & Concerns

Royal Mail - Potential Industrial Action

On 13 November the High Court ruled that CWU's postal ballot of Royal Mail
employees for industrial action was unlawful, meaning no industrial action can take
place until a new ballot is completed. Whilst this means we can safely say that they
will not strike officially over the Black Friday, Cyber Monday weekend the CWU have
now appealed the judgement. If this fails they will likely re-ballot with the possibility
that if this is expedited then they could just feasibly take industrial action in mid to
late December. A verbal update will be provided in the Board meeting.

Post Office Industrial Action

A ballot for industrial action at Post Office for Christmas industrial action now looks
unlikely. Caution has been urged regarding any new DMB franchising announcements
in the General Election campaign period because CWU would likely make political and
industrial noise about this, however, with a 5 week lead in time from an
announcement of a ballot to a day of action, they would need to manufacture a trade
dispute by Nov 19th to call Industrial action on Christmas Eve (their traditional
target).

GLO

We continue to await the outcome from our application for permission to appeal to the
Court of Appeal in respect of the Common Issues judgment and the Horizon
judgment. Contingency plans are in place for when the Horizon judgment is handed
down. Work is continuing on preparing our Defence in the Further Issues trial which
will be filed on Monday 25 November. The mediation remains in place for 27 and 28
November notwithstanding that the parties may not have received either or one of the
judgments by this time. It would be helpful for Post Office to participate in the without
prejudice mediation in any event as it will provide an opportunity to gain further
insight into the Claimants strategy and expectations. A verbal update will be provided
in the Board meeting.

Purpose, Strategy & Growth (PSG)

Progress on our PSG strategy plans is on the agenda for later in this Board meeting.

BOARD DISCUSSION PAPER
October 2019 (P7) - Performance Overview
Author: Max Jacobi Sponsor: Alisdair Cameron Meeting date: 26 Novernber 2019

Executive Summary

Context

The purpose of this paper is to summarise our financial performance, with details in the
separate slide-deck.

Overview

Trading Profit for the month closed £0.9m ahead of budget on an underlying basis,
swinging YTD performance £0.4m ahead of budget. On a reported basis we are £4.6m
ahead YTD, before adjustments (mainly accounting change impacts, with details
summarised on Page 2 and 3 of the slides).

Against the 6+6 forecast we are £1.6m ahead, but the full year 6+6 falls around £3m
short of target, and so further over performance is required.

Retail performed well against budget and forecast in Period 7, with slight upsides in
Lottery from high jackpots in month, and payment services helped by a one-off
Santander true up. Q4 remains key for payment services with opportunities such as
British Gas crystallising. Overall, weekly customer sessions are ahead of target and
have increased 1.9% YoY.

Identity’s forecasted over budgeted performance continues, boosted by a £0.5m one
off payment from agreeing a better backdated price for Vehicle tax with DVLA.

FS&T is broadly in line with forecast, with slight upsides from the recent MoneyGram
incentive and increased FRES margins. Travel money is starting to recover in the lower
season, and online margins were also reduced to increase sales.

Telco continues to underperform against budget, with high levels of fibre churn
persisting, with this being further discussed in slides 13-15. The overall market mix is
weighting more and more towards high speed (75Mb+) connections and away from
slower ADSL. This is putting pressure on the oppositely weighted Post Office customer
base, and is driving (and will likely continue to drive) further high levels of churn to
fibre.

PO Insurance performed in line with 6+6 forecast, but continues to track below budget.
Protection cancellation levels remain an area of focus with Royal London.

Change expenditure continues to be incurred more slowly than budget and forecast,
£7m behind latest 6+6 re-forecast. In month Retail spend was particularly down
(against budget and forecast) due to slower than anticipated British Gas contract
agreement. Change benefits are (£6.3m) behind budget YTD, but on track compared
with latest re-forecast, where the impact of the Peregrine deal shift has been taken in
to account.

The full year change spend forecast still remains over budget, however, this is likely to
be driven down by prioritisation over the coming months, as the aim is to be below
budget for the year.

Cash. NRF funding has returned to normal levels in Period 7, therefore we have
decreased our borrowing from BEIS accordingly by £152m from prior period, closing
the period with the government loan facility utilisation at £588m. Working capital trends
are also being reviewed to further understand the impact the changes in withdrawals
and deposit profiles is having on our headroom.

We have ongoing communication with UKGI and BEIS regarding the receipt of the final
£42m investment funding sum.

Network numbers continued to decline, although at a slower rate, with new locations
ramping up after a slow H1, and a spike in temporary closures (further analysis provided
in slide 7). Whilst safely above our minimum requirement of 11,500, our current worst
case forecast for the year potentially trends slightly below our internal target of 11,600.
Further reviews have therefore been agreed to make sure we maintain at least 11,600
through next year.

Strong trading in Retail and one-off backdated vehicle tax price increase in Identity, have partially offset continued
underperformance in Telco.

+ Whilst there are signs that Travel is recovering, Insurance continues to suffer from very tough market conditions.

+ Property rebates and planned marketing savings have improved trading profit as part of a conscious push on costs, as the
current H2 forecast delivers a below target trading performance, necessitating tight cost control to improve full year profit.

+ Slight positive trading upside (after Agents Pay), boosted by non-staff costs savings, especially within marketing.

* Whilst this is a positive start to H2, the 6+6 full year forecast fell circa £3m short of Budget, therefore we need to
maintain focus on cost savings to ensure we overachieve on this forecast and get back on track.

In period 7 there have been 55 branches which were reported trading that did not in period 6 (e.g. NNL and reopening branches and
access point activity). These were fully offset by 60 branches which did not report a customer session in period 7. 41 of these were
branch closures, 15 branches were converting model, with the remainder driven by outreach / access points not recording trading
activity.

The end of year forecast is now below 11,600, as there are a number of closures planned in Q4 which are partly driven by multiple
partner resignations (McColl's and C) Lang). These are predicted to lessen the impact of the returning outreach services and remaining
Q4 delivery pipeline,

It is expected that there will be a increase toward period 9 as the mobile vans are re-established and the planned 26 ND branches are
opened.

Trading broadly in line with forecast, with slight upsides in Lottery from high jackpots in month, and payment services from a
one-off Santander true up.

Mails trading down on forecast, but remains 4% up YoY, predominantly driven by growth in Home Shopping Returns. Year to
date increased mails income against budget has led to higher Mails Distribution Agreement VAT accrual. This is the main
driver of the non-staff costs overspend.

Agents Pay in period includes £0.2m accrual catch up and £0.3m timing.

MoneyGram branch incentive ran from September to mid October, resulting in increased volume sales.

Travel Money online margin was reduced to increase sales, driving an increase in our revenue from transactional fees.

POL margins on EUR & USD were increased by 1% in Branch during P7, which resulted in an uplift in FRES profit share of c.

£0.1m.

Broadly, staff & non-staff costs are in line with forecast in P7; Agent’s Pay is adverse due to an accrual catch up from prior
period and volume assumptions on MoneyGram.

YTD non-staff costs vs budget are £0.9m adverse from cost stretch in budget and £0.4m project opex spend that the budget
had assumed would be CapEx (including Youth Strategy write off).

* Call demand still remains challenging and is 17% higher YOY.
+ Customer save rate increased to 82% up 6% YOY.

+ Increased Fibre attachment rates from 8% to 18% supporting
our approach to future proof the base - see slides 14 and 15.

Cost of Saving Customer:

+ Average Cost Per Save continues to decline, however these
gains are offset by increased YOY demand to churn or re
negotiate their contract.

+ Weare expecting to see further cost per save reductions in
Q3.

Telco Churn — Market Moves to Fibre
Post Office mix is lagging behind wider market, which is putting pressure on future

fibre strategy.

ADSL market has shrunk by 20% YOY and lower fibre prices and higher speeds have encouraged more customers to switch.

What this means for the Post Office is, that we are unable to currently compete seriously in this space due to poor commercials (which is
being addressed in the RFP).
The Post Office’s change to faster fibre products may need to accelerate to ensure that we are not left behind.

Travel Insurance income was slightly behind forecast in P7 due to market conditions e.g. competitors
bidding aggressively on our web search terms.

General Insurance income was ahead of forecast due to strong renewal performance on both Motor
and Home.

Protection income was slightly behind forecast in P7 due to prior month correction for an add-on and
higher provisioning rates.

Other Operating Costs were £0.1m higher than forecast due to a number of minor variances.

Home Office is slightly below forecast with residency permit volumes driving the downside due to
the end of student surge.

DVLA year to date over performance against Budget is driven predominantly by International
Driving Permit volumes upside (+£0.75m) due to Brexit, a one off payment from agreeing a better
backdated price for Vehicle tax (+£0.5m) with DVLA and an increase in 10 year renewal volumes
due to increased awareness and the renewal cycle (+£0.2m).

Identity Services year to date upside against Budget is driven by security authorisation and Post
Office Document Checking Service.

Trading Performance:

. Overall Supply Chain is broadly on track against updated forecast, with small timing impacts as outlined below.

. Stationery in line with adjusted 6+6 forecast phasing, with savings plans taking effect in Q4 we look to reduce branch
consumables and reduce ink waste.

. P7 includes additional Overtime costs to reduce unprocessed cash down from £38m to zero. This was achieved faster
than expected with costs forecast in P7 & 8.

. Higher costs related to Christmas stock distribution, reflected in higher income masking the impact on the new as yet
unsigned HVM contract.

Timing:

. Income - timing of HVMs contract signing. To be dealt with independently from wider Mails contract discussion to
ensure its signed by P8.

. £0.4m of Consultancy spend in relation to the ‘future of cash review’ by Reinvigoration — reviewing to move costs to
appropriate project.

. £0.2m of increased stock holding for Brexit Contingency. Expectation that this will be back to normal by year end, with
a risk depending on actual leaving date.

Overall, in line with budget YTD, with staff costs adverse due to Arrow data excellence contractors in addition to under recovery
of security and architects resources.

Non-staff costs are favourable to budget resulting from lower licences costs due to re-negotiated contracts for SAP and Success
Factors, with full year flow through in 6+6 re-forecast. This is partially offset by adverse variance on the ATOS contract, due to
the timeline of termination in the budget different to actual termination date.

Network Cash Inventory (Gross) was £713
million at P7. The improvement versus
forecast reflects a lower level of inward rems in
Cash Centres.

The level of Network Cash Inventory continues
to track in line with both Budget and Forecast
(the gross inventory level has been within £10
million of our Budget since P4). Over the next
two period ends we expect to see increases in
our Network Cash Inventory (Gross) as we
move into the holiday season and winter fuel
payment period. Holdings are expected to
increase to £746 million at the end of P8 and
then to reach a peak of £819 million at the end
of P9. These increases will increase our
funding requirement and hence reduce facility
headroom but we anticipate remaining within
the £750 million limit on loan drawings set by
the Board.

Bonds holdings have also increased by £113
million since P6 and we continue to monitor
the position carefully.

Working capital trends are also being reviewed
to further understand the impact the changes
in withdrawals and deposit profiles is having on
our headroom.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION PAPER

Cash and Facility Management

Author: Mark Dixon Sponsor: Ai Cameron Meeting date: 26 Novernber 2019

Executive Summary

Context

Post Office is funded by Government. We have been receiving investment funding to
pay for investment costs, network subsidy to keep unprofitable branches open and we
can borrow from BEIS and the Bank Of England to fund both our working capital and
branch cash holdings. Over recent years, as set out in the table below, there have
been a number of cashflow trends:

1. Trading profit has increased, offset by lower network subsidy.

2. We have deliberately invested more than our investment funding, especially in
2014-15 and 2015-16. Subsequently we have balanced this with cash efficiencies
and have reduced net borrowings in this 3YP period after a peak in 2017-18.

3. Working capital requirements have increased in each year.

Going forward, investment funding will cease and network subsidy is not agreed. We
will be constrained in the amount we can invest. Managing our cash resources will
therefore become increasingly important.

Questions addressed in this report

1. How does cash and borrowing work?

2. What progress have we made?

3. What further efficiencies can be delivered?

4, Looking forward, what are the constraints and what can be done about them?

Conclusions
We supply the cash for branches as well as our own working capital.

Our borrowing capacity has three primary limits: a hard limit on what we can borrow
from BEIS, a security headroom limit which ensures that branch cash and client debtors
exceed borrowing from BEIS and a limit on BoE borrowing based on cash withdrawals.

This security headroom is important to Government as it means that our borrowing is
accounted for on their balance sheet as working capital not debt.

Previously, we increased borrowing significantly over a two-three year period by
investing more in the business than we were receiving in funding. In the current three-
year period to 2021 we are not seeking to borrow to invest and we have managed down
borrowing through efficiencies in supply chain.

Further efficiencies can be gained and these would enable us to fund a material GLO
settlement. This view is subject to completing funding agreements with Government
after March 2021 on the back of an agreed 5YP.

Looking forward, we should be able to manage ourselves so that trading profit and
network subsidy can be largely converted to investment spend. However, while we can
maintain a healthy facility headroom, security headroom will continue to fall, potentially
sharply and we will be operating on fine margins of headroom.

This needs to form part of the funding debate with Government for the period after
March 2021. Our focus is to

Seek to credibly incentivise the business on cash earned rather than profit

Deliver further cash efficiencies

Significantly improve our understanding and ability to forecast working capital
Significantly improve cash flow forecasting and strengthen the team. We are working
with Accenture on a proof of concept for cash forecasting. This will require some
investment funding.

The Report

How does cash and borrowing work?

1. We issue c. £870m of cash a month to customers and recover a further £1,062m.
The trend is for falling withdrawals as declines in POCA and cash usage exceed
increases in our share of banking withdrawals. Deposits values are rising through a
higher banking share.

2. At 31 March 2019, a reasonably typical example day, we controlled £1,621m of
cash, of which £845m was held in our bonded warehouses and was owned and
funded by the Bank of England. We pay to insure this cash.

3, The remaining £776m was being used in our business: £524m held in branches,
including £52m of foreign currency, and £222m in cash centres, in branch safes
waiting to be picked up and in transit. The remainder, £33m, is other non-cash
methods of customer payment, mainly cheques, in the process of clearing.

4. We funded this from two sources: we borrowed from BEIS through our Revolving
Credit Facility (the “RCF”, £565m), and we borrowed “off-balance sheet” from the
Bank of England by moving cash onto their balance sheet overnight (the “NRF”,
£227m). The surplus funding was used to support our working capital and cash at
bank of £16m.

5. Our own working capital is relatively stable and relatively small, as you would
expect with £1b of commissions, monthly payrolls for agents and staff and supplier
costs.

6. The working capital flows in the underlying business are much larger and more
volatile. We set our borrowing under the RCF 2 days in advance and can access an
emergency facility of £50m for issues which arise in that 2 days. The RCF is
capped in three ways: the limit we can borrow is formally £950m. However, the
Board requires us to operate with a £200m buffer, reducing the limit to £750m.
Secondly, to protect its security, BEIS requires us not to borrow more than the
sum of Network cash, other cash and cash equivalents and client debtors less the
Santander creditor. Thirdly Santander requires the sum of our liability to them and
to BEIS to be less than cash, near cash and some additional assets.

7. At different points in the cycle, either the facility headroom or the security
headroom can be a greater constraint. In earlier years, we were holding at lot of
cash in branches and borrowing to fund investments. This increased the amount of
cash held and the borrowing, reducing headroom against both limits. As we have
reduced cash usage, we have widened the facility headroom which is just the
difference between our borrowing and £750m but not security headroom, where
reduced cash and borrowing net off.

8. The Bank of England Note Recirculation Facility (NRF) is a product of our
membership of the Note Circulation Scheme. We can place up to £350m overnight
on the Bank’s balance sheet rather than borrowing it as part of the RCF. We
average c. £210m because of an annual cap on usage relating to the amount of old

notes we process and issue. The £210m is down from £250m two years ago as
withdrawals reduce.

What progress have we made?

10.Comparing Total Cash in Use at the end of 2016-17 to the current position our
initiatives have resulted in c£200m of cash being taken out of the network
through efficiency which has protected facility headroom. However, security
headroom has fallen consistently.

What further efficiencies can be made

11.We believe that there are a number of further efficiencies possible totalling
£80-100m

e We have now received BoE permission to vary vault opening hours, enabling
us to remove inward and outward REMs at the cash centres by staying open
until 23.30 to process inward REMs and opening at 4am to process outward
REMs, removing both from our midnight balance sheet. This should be worth
around £30+m.

e We can be tougher on branches not returning excess cash and we believe
this could be worth up to £40m.

e Weare working to take more risk on “buffer stock” (i.e. the working stock
required (mainly coin because of lead times) to ensure that we can meet the
demands of the Network). Any reduction in this stock increases the risk that
a delay in obtaining stocks (due to stress in the industry or transport issues)
will result in branch orders not being fulfilled. The impact is expected to be
less significant than the first two actions above.

e We also need to understand working capital movements better so we can
refine our forecasts.

12. This will enable us to create an additional £80m+ of facility headroom which we
will retain for the GLO.

POL00030884

POL00030884

Page I6

13.However, this does not create additional capacity in security headroom. Indeed,
it worsens security headroom because cash in branches is reduced while
borrowing is maintained after the forecast GLO spend.

Looking forward what are the constraints and what can be done
about them?

14.We have done a first piece of untested modelling. The assumptions were:

« We make £100m of cash efficiencies in 2019-20

e We spend £100m of cash on the GLO in 2020-21

e We make operating profit of £90m in 2020-21 rising to £120m for the next
few years

e Cash withdrawals drop sharply as we exit POCA March 2021 and withdraw
from ATMs on the same timetable. The latter is not agreed, is in fact unlikely
but tests our ability to manage.

e We receive £30m of network subsidy every year after 2021.

15.As the table below shows, with the fall in withdrawals, access to the NRF falls
sharply. However, the overall impact on reducing withdrawals so materially is
not in itself disastrous.

16.The Bank of England has agreed to consider allowing us to borrow consistently
until they have re-considered the basis of NCS funding: our argument is that
basis NRF capacity solely on withdrawals is archaic. RBS will support such a
change ~ we would have to let both earn interest - and it is within the rules of
the scheme but not the spirit.

17.Even without sustained NRF funding, we can manage within the facility
headroom limit and the Board could release some of the £200m buffer.

18.The issue is that security headroom will be severely reduced to a minimal buffer
of c. £30m and increased NRF capacity doesn’t help that. That would inevitably
mean that at certain points we would exceed the security headroom. It is not
clear what the implications would be.

19.To avoid this, part of the funding conversation may be to re-negotiate the exact
calculation of security headroom to exclude the Santander liability, for example.
This would be easier if Santander agreed to waive their security in exchange for
higher borrowing costs but to date they have not been keen.

20.Alternatively, we could seek to extend creditor terms with other banks, perhaps
paying every 2-3 days rather than next day.

21.Otherwise, security headroom severely limits our room to invest in future and
this must form part of the conversation with Government and could force us

into asset sales.

BOARD DECISION PAPER

Borrowing Limits

Author: Mark Dixon Sponsor: Alisdair Cameron Meeting date: 26 Novernber 2019

Executive Summary

Context

POL manages its liquidity and funding risks by ensuring it has access to sufficient
committed funding and then monitoring its funding usage against an agreed
headroom buffer.

The Board has agreed a £200 million headroom buffer on drawings on the
Government Loan.

POL proposes to temporarily reduce this buffer over the holiday period.

Questions addressed in the report

Proposed Changes to the Headroom Buffer
1. What changes are we proposing to the headroom buffer and why?

Conclusion

We wish to temporarily reduce the agreed headroom buffer from £200 million to
£100 million for the period from 27 November 2019 to 2 February 2020 in order
to provide funding flexibility over the holiday period through to the end of Period
10 when network cash inventory is higher.

Input Sought

The Board is asked to approve a derogation to draw the Government Loan up to
£850 million (i.e. to reduce the headroom buffer from £200 million to £100
million), subject to approval by the CFOO, for the period from 27 November 2019
to 2 February 2020.

The Report

What changes are we proposing to the headroom buffer and why?

1. In 2016, 2017 and 2018 the Board agreed temporary increases to the Headroom
limit from £750 million to £850 million for Periods 9 and 10, subject to approval by
the CFOO. In 2016/17 overnight drawdowns were above £750 million on 2 days, 5
January 2017 (£771 million) and 6 January 2017 (£775 million). All other drawings
were within the £750 million limit. In 2017/18 and 2018/19 drawings were kept
within the £750 million limit.

2. As anticipated, in the 2019/20 financial year, the peak deterioration in headroom is
in Period 9 as we invest in higher network cash holdings over the holiday period.

3. At the end of Period 7 drawings on the Government Loan were £588 million and
usage of the NRF was £191 million. This compared to Budget figures of £588 million
and £200 million respectively. Our overall headroom was therefore slightly better
than expectations at the time of the Budget.

4. As in previous years we expect headroom to reduce in Period 9 due to higher
network cash balances held in anticipation of higher outflows due to winter fuel
payments and higher cash withdrawals from ATMs and across counters prior to the
holiday period. In the 6 + 6 Forecast we expect network cash at the end of Period 9
(£819 million) to be more than £100 million higher than at the end of Period 7 (£713
million). Network cash then reduces significantly by the end of Period 10.

5. Given our position at the end of Period 7 and our projected cash usage over
subsequent periods through to Period 9, we do not expect to need to draw beyond the
£750 million Board approved limit on the Government Loan in Period 9. This position
will improve after Period 9 and we expect to also be within the £750 million limit at
the end of the financial year.

6. However, this position is dependent upon the timing of capital and investment
spend and the receipt of grants from Government and, in order to be prudent around
this critical period, we are therefore requesting a temporary derogation for Period 9
and Period 10 (through to 2 February 2020).

7. We are requesting a derogation to draw the Government Loan up to £850 million

(i.e. to reduce the headroom buffer from £200 million to £100 million), subject to
approval by the CFOO, for the period from 27 November 2019 to 2 February 2020.

Group Litigation Update

Author: Ben Foat/Rodric Williams Sponsor: Ben Foat Meeting date: 26 November 2019

Executive Summary

Context

Post Office is awaiting decisions from the courts on the Horizon Issues trial (which is
now imminent), and on Post Office’s application for permission to appeal the March
2019 Common Issues judgment (which should be received on Friday 22 November
2019).

As reported to the Board on 8 November 2019, the “KEL Disclosure Issue” identified in
October 2019 has been resolved with the Court and the Claimants, and should not
impact delivery of the Horizon judgment.

On 25 October 2019 we received the Claimants’ individual Particulars of Claim (“IPOCs”)
for the third, Further Issues trial scheduled for March 2020. Post Office’s Defences
replying to the IPOCs must be filed by 25 November 2019.

Mediation to explore settlement with the Claimant group remains scheduled for 27-28
November 2019. On 29 October 2019 the Post Office Board authorised the Group
Litigation Subcommittee to delegate to the General Counsel authority to make
settlement offers at mediation, on terms determined by the Subcommittee.

Questions addressed in this report

1. What is the update on the Group Litigation (Horizon judgment; Common Issues trial;
Further Issues trial; future trials)?

2. What settlement authority has been provided for the mediation on 27-28 November
2019?

3. What are the next steps in the Group Litigation?

Conclusion

1. The Horizon judgment is now imminent. We expect to receive on 22 November 2019
the Court of Appeal’s decision on whether to grant Post Office permission to appeal
the Common Issues judgment. Post Office must file its Defences for the March 2020
“Further Issues” trial by 25 November 2019. The parties aim to exchange criteria
for selecting “Test Claimants” for future trials on 12 December 2019.

2. Post Office’s General Counsel has been authorised to make settlement offers up to
£65m, with shareholder approval required for any settlement above £50m.

3. The next key steps in the litigation are: attending to the courts’ decisions on the
Horizon trial and Post Office’s application for permission to appeal the Common

POL00030884

POL00030884

Issues judgment once received; filing Post Office’s Defences for the Further Issues
trial by 25 November 2019; and attending mediation on 27-28 November 2019.

Input Sought Input Received

The Subcommittee is asked to NOTE the This paper has been prepared with
updates in this paper and the next steps to the assistance of external legal

be taken in the litigation. counsel.

The Board is reminded to exercise caution when communicating about potential levels
of settlement. Communications about settlement should therefore only be held oraily,
but if that is not possible, advice should be sought from Post Office’s lawyers.

Litigation Update

Horizon Judgment

We have still not received the draft Judgment on the Horizon Issues trial, which is now
imminent. On 6 November 2019 the Managing Judge emailed the parties advising that
“intended dates for distribution of the draft will be circulated in due course”. The Board
will be updated on the judgment’s content and outcomes once it has been received.

The Claimants may seek to postpone the mediation scheduled for 27-28 November
2019 if they do not feel they have sufficient time to consider the judgment ahead of the
mediation. However they have not yet asked for this.

KEL Disclosure Issue
As separately reported on 8 November 2019, we have resolved with the Claimants and
the Court the issue which came to light in October 2019 concerning disclosure of the
Horizon “Known Error Logs” (KELs) for the Horizon trial:
- the Claimants have informed us and the Court that they do not want to take any
further steps on this issue; and
- the audit we commissioned on the completeness of Fujitsu's KEL disclosure did
not identify any further KELs which need to be disclosed or require Post Office to
change the submissions we made about Horizon during the trial.
The KEL issue should not therefore have any direct impact on the Horizon trial or delay
delivery of the judgment.

Common Issues Appeal

The oral hearing of Post Office’s application for permission to appeal the Common Issues
judgment handed down in March 2019 took place on Tuesday 12 November 2019. We
should receive on Friday 22 November 2019 the Court of Appeal’s decision on whether
permission to appeal has been granted or refused. The Board will be updated on the
outcomes from the application once we have received that decision.

Third / Further Issues Trial

On 25 October 2019 we received from the Claimants individual particulars of claim
(IPOCs) for four test cases (Abdulla, Bates, Stubbs and Stockdale, each a “Lead
Claimant” in the November 2018 Common Issues trial). The IPOCs set out the types of
loss each Claimant is claiming for the purposes of the March 2020 Further Issues trial,
which trial will determine whether those losses are recoverable in principle and, if so,
how they should be quantified.

The Claimants are seeking recovery of a very wide range of loss and damage, but have
not put any values on these claims in the IPOCs. The legal principles behind many of
the claims are not contentious, although the way which the Claimants seek to apply
them can be. The two claims we see as being most contentious are:
post-termination losses, which on the Claimants’ best case could be worth c.
£148m if payable up to the date of their retirement; and
litigation funding costs, which on Herbert Smith Freehills’ analysis could be
worth c. £72m (as at May 2020, assuming a 4x multiplier is applied to their
incurred legal costs).

Post Office must file its Defences to the IPOCs by 25 November 2019. Helen Davies QC
and Tony Robinson QC have been retained to lead this work. The Board Subcommittee
noted the approach being taken to the Defences at its 13 November 2019 meeting.

Future Trials

The parties have agreed to exchange on 12 December 2019 proposed criteria for
selecting “Test Claimants”, whose cases could be used as representative of the wider
Claimant group in a future trial on breach (i.e. whether Post Office acted wrongly),
causation (i.e. did that breach cause the Claimant's harm), and limitation (i.e. is a
Claimant's claim time-barred).

No other dates have been set for selecting Test Claimants, or for completing the
procedural steps required for trials on breach, causation and limitation. The parties will
be asking the Court to schedule a Case Management Conference in January 2020 for
this purpose.

Costs

As presented to the Board on 30 April 2019, £8m was initially included in the 19/20
Budget for the cost of the litigation. Since then, and as included in the October 2019
Quarterly Delivery Board Paper, this allocation in the 19/20 Budget has been increased
to £15m and as at P7, £7.7m has been spent. By the end of November 2019, we will
know whether we have permission to appeal the Common Issues judgment, the Horizon
judgment will have been received, and the first mediation meeting will have taken place.
A revised spend forecast will be provided at the January 2020 Board.

Mediation ~ Settlement Authority

Mediation with the Claimant group will take place at Herbert Smith Freehills’ London
offices on 27 and 28 November 2019, with Charles Flint QC and Stephen Ruttle QC
acting as mediators (whose profiles are available in the Reading Room). The key Post

POL00030884

POL00030884

PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT FORWARD OR SHARE

Office representatives at mediation will be General Counsel Ben Foat and Alan Watts
from Herbert Smith Freehills, with Post Office CEO Nick Read attending to make
introductory commercial remarks. We do not as yet know the make-up of the
Claimants’ mediation team.

On 13 November 2019 the Board Subcommittee considered advice from solicitors
Herbert Smith Freehills LLP that settlement at a level between £40m and £65m would
be a good result for Post Office, and authorised the General Counsel to make settlement
offers at mediation within that range, subject to shareholder approval for any offers
above £50m as set out below.

As Shareholder approval is required for any settlement above £50m, the Shareholder
is currently working through its approvals process, which it aims to complete prior to
the mediation. The Subcommittee has asked the Shareholder to put in place a
mechanism through which Post Office can seek its approval on an expedited basis
should that facilitate obtaining a settlement at an acceptable level during the mediation.

Next Steps
An overview of the main court and settlement-related activity in the Group Litigation
through to October 2020 is set out in the “Group Litigation Timetable” at Appendix 1.

Between now and December 2019 we will:
e attend to the Horizon judgment and Court of Appeal’s decision on our application
for permission to appeal the Common Issues Judgment once received;
e file Defences for the Further Issues trial by 25 November 2019;
e attend mediation on 27-28 November 2019; and
e draw up proposed criteria for selecting Test Claimants for later trials.

A timeline of the key milestones to January 2020 is set out at Appendix 2.

Operational responses to the Common Issues judgment and Contingency Planning for
the Horizon judgment are being reported separately.

= The PSG team has worked closely with Post Office Finance team to depict a picture of product and
channel profitability based on existing Post Office data

« As per last Board meeting, we are presenting product profitability using “Contribution”, a new
profitability view developed by the PO Finance team, which splits total overheads between “True”
overheads (e.g., finance, HR and legal) and Allocated Indirects (e.g., CIO and DMB costs, which are
otherwise part of total overheads)

» Channel profitability is presented on trading profit terms

« The analysis drives several insights:

& — Asof FY 2018-19, Post Office top revenue driver is Mails (35% of £1bn), while Financial
: Services is top contribution driver (46%, £65m) with best contribution margin (45%)

— Over the next two years, product contribution mix changes significantly: almost 50% of
contribution is expected to be driven by Cash & Banking (£84m), while only 25% (vs. 45%) is
driven by Financial Services. Mail contribution remains stable (~10% of total)

Executive summary — Where we make money: Product profitability

= As areminder, in FY2018-19, Post Office generated ~£1bn of revenues and £60m trading profits, a 6% margin

= In FY2018-19 the top 4 drivers of revenues were Mail (35% of total revenues), Cash & Banking (17%),
Telecoms (15%) and Financial Services (14%)

= Over the next 2 years, baseline forecasted revenue is expected to grow 3% CAGR with Mails remaining flat,
Cash & Banking growing at 24% CAGR and Financial Services shrinking at -10% CAGR

= An analysis of the Direct Contribution shows every product category made a positive direct contribution in
FY2018-19; FS the highest direct contribution margin at 71%

= Overall, Direct Contribution is expected to remain stable over next 2 years (+1% CAGR) in PO Finance
baseline forecast at £434m as Cash & Banking growth is offset by shrinking Financial Services and Identity

= The POL Finance team worked to refine the profitability view by splitting Total Overheads between Allocated
Indirect Costs and “True” Overheads, providing a view on Contribution (14% of revenues)

= Allocated Indirect Costs include ClO, DMB, Network Ops, Agent Fixed Remuneration and Marketing. These
can be allocated to product categories using standard assumptions

= Compared to “Direct Contribution”, the “Contribution” proportion of Mails is significantly smaller (16% vs.
36%), FS is almost double (46% vs. 24%) and Payments is loss-making

= Contribution is expected to grow ~11% CAGR by FY2020-21 in PO baseline forecast, at which point Cash &
Banking expected to drive almost half of Contribution while Mails and FS shrink, and Identity increases its

Summary of OHI findings and their potential uses

Diagnostic headlines
* Impressive level of engagement with the survey
* Bottom quartile organisational health indicating significant opportunity for improvement

= Accountability, work environment and motivation relative strengths (though still third quartile): relatively more effective in creating a
sense of community and belonging; practices around openness, trust, engaging leadership and ownership amongst most emphasised

* Purpose and direction not clearly understood, reinforcing need for current work on Purpose, Strategy & Growth

= Lack of consistent measurement and management of business and risk, or acting to address problems

= Lack of institutional skills and talent, external orientation and innovation/learning

= Overall, senior managers’ views most critical (especially innovation and learning)

= Current values centre around community, being of service, care and respect, but also hierarchy and bureaucracy; whereas desired
values include competitiveness, accountability, efficiency and being well organised

= Main purpose themes at Post Office are about being a trusted brand, with access for all, serving customer's mails, parcel and cash
needs

Uses of the OHI findings

* Syndicate the results internally to increase understanding of the challenges (both generally and for particular parts of the organisation)
= Start to create a narrative about the required change building on the quantitative and qualitative detail of the survey results

* Use the detailed information about where practices need to change to inform concrete improvement initiatives

= Once Purpose, Strategy & Growth are clearer, use OHI results to inform what is needed to enable the new strategy

= Track progress and course correct where/if needed

Organisational health is related to — but different from — organisational performance

The OHI survey digs deep to understand what’s happening under the surface and

Executive summary — postal market overview

« Postal players have been under increasing pressure. Several trends contribute to this:
« Structural and irreversible decline of the mail business

« Customers demanding higher convenience and service in the core products offered by postal
players, while often not being willing to pay higher prices (especially B2C e-commerce parcel

senders)
: » Disruptors are winning the postal players’ natural new growth segments (e.g. parcels and
2 financial services), in particular Amazon

« Regulatory pressure to maintain retail network coverage and USO requirements continue

impacting postal players’ economics; although most European players still enjoy some form of
subsidy

Executive summary — learnings from postal players

There are three pillars of learnings from other post players:

1. Winning in competitive growth areas requires adapting the retail network structure to better serve consumers
(e.g., DHL’s dense parcelshop network provides convenience to its e-commerce receivers)

~ Multi-tiered networks allow for improved economics without compromising on sales and convenience

2. Growing the top-line through non-core, third-party products usually fails to create sizeable revenue
streams. Most sizable growth areas are parcels and financial services. Sales performance programmes as
well as targeted incentives can be effective growth levers

3. Remaining competitive with a lean cost base requires consolidating footprint and different approaches to
ownership (e.g., franchise, dealers)

— Automation in selected areas, both in customer-facing activities and in in-store operations, is a key
lever to improve customer experience in a cost-effective manner, culminating in the “unmanned branch”
(Singapore, Finland)

— Strong partnerships with retailers (e.g. in Canada) have been successful, based on standardised
master franchise arrangements and clear understanding of economic benefits of having a post office (e.g.
15% sales uplift for retail)

@ Portugal’s CTT has moved up the FS value chain from distribution to creating

and broadening the product offering

Where CTT started

POL00030884

pe. ctt

* In 2015, Banco CTT was created as legal
entity with banking license provided by Bank
of Portugal

* Prior to this, CTT offered very limited
financial services

= CTT had a very strong existing mass market
postal customer base

* The initial approach was for a low risk
balance sheet strategy

i il
Dedicated counter space

) Key developments

The bank focuses on the mass market,

offering simple, transactional products

~ Principles of fairness, transparency,
low cost

Lending began as an intermediary, in

partnership with Cetelem

~  Itis gradually increasing its
exposure to credit risk and
broadening the product range

The initial 51 branches have expanded to

~200, built off CTT’s postal network

~ Branches have either multifunction
counters (with postal), dedicated
counters, or dedicated space

2) Successful postal peers transformed their branches in multi- tiered networks to
allow sales, convenience and lower cost

@ Sales focus
Large offices with a wide range of services

Primary goal is to provide the highest quality service and ensure a positive
brand perception

@ Service focus
Mid-sized offices with an optimal set of services

Primary goal is to provide fast, efficient and high-quality of large volumes of
transactions

© Local Access
Small offices with a narrow range of core services

Primary goal is meet the accessibility criteria/social needs or provide a response
to the competition

© Direct Channels

A set of alternative channels provides more options to the customer and increases the
quality of customer service — mainly websites, mobile applications, call centers

3) “Lessons learned” from other postal services companies yield several insights for
POL direction

@ Every post has made attempts to grow outside the core in “adjacent” markets. The vast majority of these
efforts has failed to create either sizeable revenue streams (more than £20m per annum) or profits. E.g.,
mailroom management, ID validation, secure email, digital letterbox, document archiving, warehousing, postie
add on services (meter reading) etc

@ The successes have been primarily from legacy assets, in particular growth of financial services and
mobile (e.g., Poste Italiane), as well as parcel markets

® Other posts have, in general, failed to incubate new businesses organically. There have been some
successes in making acquisitions, especially in two areas:

* Rollup of other express or parcel operators (DHL Express in Europe, UPS and Fedex globally)

* Acquisition of businesses which have subsequently been run at arm’s length in order to preserve different
culture and people processes e.g. Deutsche Post acquisition of digital marketing boutiques Nugg and Admail

* Pay out incentives frequently and more often to create

right frontline motivation

= Create gradual incentives to drive growth — don’t create
strong step function

* Ensure employees clearly understand how their
incentives tie to overall goals of the institution

* Prioritize strategic objectives (e.g., tiered quotas)

* Drive collaboration amongst sales teams (e.g., group
bonus)

« Use leverage in financial incentives to drive appropriate a
employee behavior 1 Post

* Provide attractive non-cash incentives to conveys
importance and special appreciation

* Build loyalty to the company through unique and culture-

Q

Insights
for POL

* Shoppers Drug Mart, a franchised organisation itself,
owns ~50% of Canada Post franchised branches

= Canada Post agrees a framework with Shoppers Drug
Mart but actual contract is signed on a store-by-store
basis — very specific formal contract with standard
terms and pricing

= The Master Franchisee is responsible for paying most of
the setup cost, i.e., standard fit-out, staging and
equipment

* The relationship between Canada Post and Shoppers
Drug Mart is renewed every 5 years

» Although Master Franchise models create a leaner agent
servicing structure, larger contract management teams
are required to ensure consistency among franchisees

= Fixed period contracts allow the franchised
organisation to update arrangement terms if desired,
making it easier to change franchise strategy

POL00030884

REMINDER: Big Bets will help shape the future of the Post Office

Research found that a significant and flexible reallocation of
resources to support “big bets” is one of the most important
drivers of revenue growth and profitability improvement

“Big bets” are initiatives that require significant resources and
investment (£10m+ of total CAPEX and exceptional spend over the
entire duration of the project) and will materially impact the strategy
and/or operating model of the Post Office

We developed a methodology by which we propose to assess and
choose a portfolio of “big bets” using 3 dimensions: financial
returns, ease of value capture and fit with the purpose of the Post
Office

Since the previous Board meeting, we have:
— Further developed our long list of potential Big Bets
— Assessed the Big Bets against the 3 said dimensions

— Started ruling out some Big Bets on the basis of poor
financials or low feasibility

POST OFFICE LIMITED BOARD PAGE 1 OF 14
PAPER
Framework Document & Articles of Association Update
Author; Mark Underwood Sponsor: Ben Foat Meeting date: 26 November 2019

Context

At the July Board, the CEO or CFO and General Counsel (GC) were given authority to finalise the
Articles of Association (AoA) and Framework Document (FD), subject to any further material
changes. In September 2019, the Board subsequently approved the outstanding Group Reserved
Matters in the draft AoA and for the FD to include a commitment for POL to comply with the
relevant guidance of the Public Sector Pay and Terms (PSP&T) as set out in a note from UKGI,
which had been discussed at the Remuneration Committee (RemCo) ahead of Board. In practical
terms and once the FD is adopted, this means POL will not offer private medical insurance (PMI)
to new joiners although, as was flagged at RemCo, the FD provides an open ended mechanism
for UKGI to apply further public sector guidance and seek a far wider application of the PSP&T.

Subject to confirmation from UKGI (and the subsequent HMG approval process), we now believe
the AoA to be final and in agreed form.

In respect of the FD, UKGI has since informed POL that it also wants the FD to include:

. The requirement to comply with the principles and provisions of the Financial Reporting
Council’s UK Corporate Governance Code (‘The Code’) and, to the extent that POL does
not intend to observe the Code, that the Shareholder Representative be notified in
advance. In large, and to the extent they are applicable to POL as a limited company, POL
already adheres to the standards set out within the Code and subsequent to being
discussed at GE on 28 September, we are comfortable with the inclusion as proposed by
UKGI.

. Two additional appendices that set out i) a detailed description of the Shareholder
Representative’s role which, as currently drafted, could be considered to extend into
executive territory and embeds the role further in the company’s constitution and
governance; and ii) POL will “observe” the PSP&T.

Questions addressed in this Report

1. Does the proposed description of the Shareholder Representative’s role reflect typical
shareholder rights within a government context and what are the recommended
amendments to the proposed draft?

2. How should POL’s commitment to comply with the relevant guidance of the PSP&T be
reflected in the FD?

Conclusion

1. Subject to the proposed amendments being accepted, the activities included within the
description of the Shareholder Representative’s role are not dissimilar to what one would
expect to see for other wholly owned subsidiaries with sole shareholders (particularly within
a government context). It is recommended that POL make some changes to the drafting

POL00030884
POL00030884

POST OFFICE LIMITED BOARD PAGE 2 OF 14
PAPER

proposed by UKGI to ensure these rights do not extend into executive management. Annex
1 sets out the proposed amended wording.

2. The inclusion of an additional standalone appendix in the FD, specifically for the PSP&T,
seems unnecessary given all other pieces of Corporate Guidance applicable to Public
Corporations are listed within Appendix 2 of the FD. Although the UKGI RemCo paper makes.
it clear that the PSP&T applies to POL in its entirety and that this was accepted at the
September POL Board - in practical terms the UKGI RemCo paper describes the current
‘enforcement’ or approach of this guidance to be limited to POL not offering private medical
insurance to future employees. The risk of enforcement of further requirements in respect.
of any public sector guidance (and a far wider application of the PSP&T than the pragmatic
limited impact set out in the UKGI RemCo paper) was discussed at the September RemCo.

The options are:

(a) Accepting the additional appendix (and its wording) proposed by UKGI (see annex
3 of this paper); or

(b) Refusing the additional appendix (and its wording), reverting back to the UKGI
with a request for the PSP&T to be re-inserted in Appendix 2 of the FD, along
with a footnote which limits the application or practical effect of the PSP&T to
private medical insurance (see annex 4 of this paper);

Input Sought Input Received
The Board is asked to: Linklaters LLP

- Approve the description of the Shareholder
Representative’s role and, its inclusion within the FD.

- Consider and decide how PSP&T should be reflected in
the FD, namely:

« Accepting the additional appendix (and its wording)
proposed by UKGI (see annex 3 of this paper); or

e Refusing the additional appendix (and its wording),
reverting back to the UKGI with a request for the
PSP&T to be re-inserted in Appendix 2 of the FD,
along with a footnote which narrows the recognition
of the current practical effect of the PSP&T to in
relation to the private medical insurance (see
annex 4 of this paper).

POST OFFICE LIMITED BOARD PAGE 3 OF 14
PAPER

UKGI's Proposed Inclusion of a Description of the Shareholder Representative’s
Role within the Framework Document

1. The FD, as currently proposed by UKGI, now includes a detailed description of what they
believe to be the role of the Shareholder Representative. Once the wording is agreed, its
inclusion will formalise the role and responsibilities of the Shareholder Representative and
bring clarity but also a degree of permanence to the scope of the role.

2. Broadly speaking, the activities included within the description of the Shareholder
Representative’s role are not dissimilar to what one would expect to see for other wholly
owned subsidiaries with sole shareholders (particularly within a government context).
However, POL will need make some changes to the drafting proposed by UKGI to ensure
these rights do not extend into executive management. A mark-up is included in Annex 1
of this paper.

3. If the Board is comfortable that the description of the Shareholder Representative’s role
reflects the intended ongoing relationship with the Shareholder Representative, it can be
included as an annex to the FD - subject to confirmation from UKGI.

UKGI's Proposed Inclusion of an Additional Standalone Appendix Setting out the
Application of the Public Sector Pay & Terms to POL

1. While the FD is not legally binding, given that it will be a public document, it will be difficult
for UKGI and POL to step away from its terms which govern the relationship between the
parties.

2. The current draft of the FD requires POL to have regard to the government wide corporate
guidance applicable to public corporations listed in an appendix to the FD and any future
relevant guidance as specified by Government to the extent that such guidance is applicable
to POL as a Public Non-Financial Corporation. This is a very broad obligation on POL and the
Board has been previously briefed on the risk that the Government will expect certain current
and future guidance to apply to POL despite the fact that legally POL may not be required
to apply this guidance.

3. This risk has been highlighted by the PSP&T which covers pay setting arrangements for
public sector employees, including departments, non-ministerial departments and agencies,
as well as for public sector workers in non-departmental public bodies and other arm’s length
bodies. The guidance provides a framework within which all departments will set pay, and
for departmental pay strategies and pay reporting, unless there is an existing multi-year or
other agreement in place. The guidance, which was updated on 22 July 2019, is expressed
to be a “reminder of the cross-cutting public sector pay and terms rules that are in place,
and the government's expectations on public sector employers".

POL00030884

POL00030884
POST OFFICE LIMITED BOARD PAGE 4 OF 14
PAPER
4. Whether POL is subject to PSP&T has been a live question since at least October 2018. It

was suggested three key documents could apply to POL:

a. The Senior Pay Guidance - Requires Chief Secretary to the Treasury approval for any
packages of £150k or above or bonuses of more than £17,500.

b. Civil Service Pay Guidance - Confers a power to make pay awards within the range of
1% to 1.5% (but not more).

c. Pay and Terms Guidance - Contains a reminder of the Senior Pay Controls, a restriction
against using contractors, a marker that the Government intends to cap exit payments
at £95k, limits use of confidentiality clauses, restricts use of salary sacrifice schemes,
requires prudent staff travel expenses, employment contracts of high earners to contain
an expectation that salaries will be published, restricts certain benefits including private
medical insurance.

POL took advice from Martin Chamberlain QC on 7 December 2018. Counsel’s view was: the
Senior Pay Guidance applied to POL but only to roles subject to ministerial approval, i.e. the
Chief Executive, Chairman and Directors; the Civil Service Pay Guidance did not apply; and
he did not believe the PSP&T currently applied to POL. UKGI was provided with this opinion
and POL’s view and POL invited the Government to indicate whether it agreed. POL is still
waiting on a response from HMT who have advised that they are taking legal advice on the
issue.

On 4 Sept 2019, UKGI, wrote to POL to confirm that the Senior Pay Guidance only applied
to ministerial appointments (ie Board directors) but not otherwise (ie no other employees),
and that the Civil Service Pay guidance did not apply to POL. They were of the opinion that
the PSP&T did apply to POL but explained, informally, what UKGI felt the pragmatic approach
would be, i.e. POL should not offer PMI to new joiners. Separately, pay in lieu of pension or
car allowances should not be offered to the CEO and CFO.

The September POL Board agreed to the FD including a commitment for POL to comply with
the relevant guidance of the PSP&T and that in practical terms, this meant POL would not
offer private medical insurance to new joiners (but that the cash equivalent could be built
into base salaries and employees could still participate in the private healthcare scheme
offered through the company at a charge). This commitment and what it means in ‘practical
terms’ for POL was set out in a UKGI Paper which was discussed at the RemCo ahead of the
September Board.

During a call with UKGI it was initially suggested by UKGI that the UKGI RemCo paper could
be appended to the FD in its entirety, but it was subsequently agreed that a footnote
describing how, in practical terms, the PSP&T would apply to POL would suffice.

On 6 November 2019, UKGI shared with POL a revised version of the FD, highlighting that
they had removed the reference to the PSP&T in Appendix 2 of the FD (which is where all of
the other various pieces of Corporate Guidance applicable to Public Corporations are listed)
and had inserted an additional Appendix, solely, to set out how POL will observe the PSP&T.

going forward. This proposed appendix and the UKGI RemCo paper are included in Annex
2 and 3 of this paper respectively.

8. Although the UKGI RemCo paper makes it clear that the PSP&T applies to POL in its entirety
and that this was accepted - in practical terms the UKGI RemCo paper describes the current
‘enforcement’ of this guidance to be limited to POL not offering private medical insurance to
future employees. The risk to accepting that POL was subject to the PSP&T, as was socialised
at RemCo, was that a far wider application of the PSP&T could be sought in the future,
including in relation to £95k cap on exit payments.

9. The Board is asked to confirm its position in respect of the application of PSP&T.

PAPER

Annex 2 — UKGI’s RemCo Paper

Public sector pay and terms: application to POL

HM Treasury looks to control and influence pay across the entire public sector to safeguard public
money and ensure that senior pay is proportionate and justifiable. The degree of control varies
across organisations but in general the trend has been for HMT to increase oversight and reduce
the degree of freedom that public sector entities are given to set their own policies.

Senior appointments

The Articles of Association require the Shareholder to approve the remuneration, terms and
conditions of ministerial appointments. This covers the CEO, CFO, Chair and Non-Executive
Directors. All aspects of pay and terms and conditions are subject to approval including
contractual terms, salary and salary increases, benefits, pension arrangements, performance
related pay (STIP and LTIP) and termination payments need to be approved.

CST is expected to continue to reject remuneration for ministerial appointments that include PMI
(see below), cash allowances and pay in lieu of pension.

Other staff

Historically, POL has had pay freedom in relation to other staff. HM Treasury has now made it
clear that they expect all public sector bodies to comply with Public Sector Pay guidance. This
guidance is attached (see Annex 5). It is distinct from the Civil Service Pay guidance, which
applies to a more limited set of public sector bodies, and not the Post Office.

It is worth reading the guidance in full. Some of the key points are:

- Private medical insurance (PMI) should not be offered to employees at any level of the
organisation. HMT understand that it is problematic to unwind this for current employees,
and that a pragmatic solution is not to offer PMI for new joiners.

- The 95k cap on exit payments does not currently apply to POL. HMT’s public position is that
they wish to extend this rule to the entire public sector in future. Any change would require

- The government expects every part of the public sector to demonstrate that it is using public
money efficiently and responsibly and to ensure that pay and terms are always
proportionate, justifiable and deliver value for money for taxpayers

- The application of these rules should be reflected in ALBs’ Framework Documents

It continues to be the case that the Civil Service Pay guidance (which caps pay growth for the
whole organisation) does not apply to POL.

On a practical level, the consequences are as follows:

- That POL should not offer PMI for new joiners.

- The Framework document will need to include a commitment from POL to comply with the
relevant guidance on public sector pay and terms.

Annex 5 ~ Public Sector Pay & Terms Guidance Note

Public sector pay and terms: guidance
note

Details

This guidance note is a reminder of the cross-cutting public sector pay and terms rules that
are in place, and the government’s expectations on public sector employers

There may be additional rules and processes in place for determining other elements of public
sector remuneration, such as the setting of average pay increases through the Pay Review
Bodies process or Civil Service Pay Guidance. Where appropriate and required. public sector
organisations should continue to operate within these rules

1. Guidance
1.1 Senior pay controls

The approval of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (CST) is required for civil service
appointments and appointments to public sector bodies which are subject to Ministerial
approval where the pay and remuneration package is £150,000 or above. CST sign-off is also
required for bonus arrangements worth more than £17,500. Any breach of the control process
may result in a deduction from the departmental budget or an increase in spending controls.
Further details can be found in the senior pay guidance.*

More generally, public sector employers should always ensure that senior pay
proportionate and justifiable and that terms and conditions are in line with other staff.
Contracts for senior staff should include the expectation that salaries will be published. For
local government, where decisions are for locally-elected members, ministers have said that
proposals to appoint staff on salaries of £100.000 or more should be subject to a vote of full
council

The government is committed to tackling all forms of tax avoidance and have taken forward a
wide range of measures to close down tax loopholes. It is essential that public sector
employers are able to assure themselves that their staff are meeting their tax obligations.
Arrangements set up explicitly to avoid tax would normally breach the principles set out in
Managing Public Money. *

Public sector organisations should not engage in. or connive at, tax evasion, tax avoidance or
tax planning. If a public sector organisation were to obtain financial advantage by moderating
the tax paid by a contractor, supplier or other counterparty, it would usually mean that the
Exchequer as a whole would be worse off - thus conflicting with the accounting officer’s
duties.

POL00030884
POL00030884

POST OFFICE LIMITED BOARD PAGE 12 OF 14
PAPER

Since 2017, public sector employers have been required by 1R35 legislation to deduct income
tax and National Insurance Contributions, where an individual would have been an employee
if they were providing their services directly and where the employer is the fee-payer to
individual. In addition to this, departments must abide by HM Treasury's off-payroll rule:
which are clear that the most senior staff should be on the payroll, unless there are
exceptional temporary circumstances.

13

xii payments

The government has legislated to cap public sector exit payments at £95,000 and to ensure
that high earning public sector workers who take a new job in the same part of the public
sector within twelve months of leaving will have to repay some of their exit payment.
Secondary legislation is required to bring these policies into force and the government is
currently considering options for implementation,

1.4 Confidentiality clauses

Confidentiality clauses should only be used in exceptional circumstances and not as a matter
of course. These clauses should not be used to stop, stifle or control individuals from raising
concems or to cover up cases of individual or organisational failure, As set out in annex 4.13
of Managing Public Money “any proposal to keep a special payment confidential must be
justified especially carefully since confidentiality could appear to mask underhand dealing.
Also, financial reporting requirements and Freedom of Information legislation should be
complied with”.

Guidance has been published for the Civil Service and Arm Length Bodies (ALBs)”* and for
local government.’ The government expects other parts of the public sector to follow a
similar approach where specific requirements have not been set out.

1.5 Salary sacrifice

Salary sacrifice arrangements mean employees and employers paying less income tax and
National Insurance on remuneration.

Public sector employers should consider their use of these schemes carefully, particularly
when considering any new schemes. New schemes are likely to be considered novel or
contentious and, for those bodies covered by Managing Public Money, Treasury approval
will generally be required before they are established.

1.6 Travel

Public sector employees should make sure that public money and other resources are used
properly and efficiently and that expenditure is reasonable and defensible. This principle
forms part of the Civil Service Code," and all employees across the public sector should take
a similar approach. Public sector employers should ensure that all travel is necessary and staff
use the most efficient and economic means of travel in the circumstances.

Travel by business or first class is only permitted if there is a strong business need to do so.

Government departments are required to be transparent about spend in this area, for example
by publishing details of senior officials’ business expenses, hospitality and meetings with

POL Board - 26

POL00030884

POL00030884

POST OFFICE LIMITED BOARD PAGE 13 OF 14
PAPER

external organisations, The wider public sector should take a similar approach to enable
taxpayers to see how public money is being spent.

1.7 Transparency

Openness and transparency have an important role to play in strengthening public
accountability and supporting public service improvement. As part of the government’s
transparency agenda, there are a range of requirements on public sector employers to publish
information to enable the public to hold them to account on senior salaries and expenses.

For example, the Cabinet Office publishes an annual central ‘high earners’ list"’ of
individuals in departments, agencies and Non-Departmental Public Bodies earning a full-time
total pay rate of £150,000 and above. Contracts for senior staff should include the expectation
that salaries will be published.

Public sector employers are also required to assure themselves that they are acting in
compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

1.8 Other benefits

When considering offering other types of pay and terms which are not covered above, public

sector employers should take into account paragraph 2.3.4 of Managing Public Money, which
makes clear that Treasury delegation ‘cannot extend to transactions which set precedents, are

novel, contentious or could cause repercussions elsewhere in the public sector’, alongside any
guidance specific to their workforce.

In particular, the government is clear that public sector employers should not offer private
medical insurance.

1.9 Complying with this guidance
As set out throughout the guidance, the government expects every part of the public sector to.

demonstrate that it is using public money efficiently and responsibly and to ensure that pay
and terms are always proportionate, justifiable and deliver value for money for taxpayers.

This guidance reflects rules which have been issued by the Treasury and form part of the
delegation framework for government departments and their arm’s length bodies. In central
government departments and their ALBs, primary responsibility for ensuring that these rules
are followed falls to the Principal Accounting Officers, who should also make arrangements
to satisfy themselves that their ALBs have systems adequate to meet the standards,

The application of these rules should be reflected in ALBs* Framework Documents, and any
proposal for public spending outside the agreed approach would be considered a breach of the
regularity requirements of Managing Public Money.

While loca! authorities, including fire and rescue authorities, are not covered by Managing
Public Money, the government is clear that they should operate to the same standards as the
rest of the public sector in relation to decisions on senior pay and reward.

Royal Mail (RM) MDA Negotiations

Author: Mark Siviter Sponsor: Debbie Smith Meeting Date: 26 November 2019
Executive Summary

Context

Since our update to the board in September we have completed a further, more
intensive round of negotiations with RM which have been both productive and held
in the spirit of collaboration with the aim of getting to a deal by 18 January 2020.
We now have a more detailed picture of the shape of an available deal.

Questions addressed in this report

1. What has changed since the September board update?

2. What have we achieved in the latest round of negotiations?
3. What are the remaining sticking points?

4. What are our recommended next steps?

Conclusion

1. On Tuesday 12'" November RM failed to have a record £50m fine from Ofcom for
abuse of dominance overturned, and on Wednesday 13'" November Royal Mail won
its legal challenge to prevent a postal strike after the High Court backed its
application for an injunction. On Thursday 215* November RM Half Year results will
be published and we forecast a positive top line story, but bottom line continued
headwinds that may add to investor and share price pressure.

2. We have agreed term, renegotiation events and exit, no restrictions in the new deal,
online subject to the details, and have closed the gap on the money to within 2%
like-for-like, taking the c£54m proposed discount from RM off the table.

3. The primary sticking points relate to the detail behind the money and closing the
2% gap, Post Office ability to sell RM products online on the basis of a level playing
field, and the approach to change management as RM are seeking to limit our ability
to refuse change requests.

4, We will continue with negotiations with a view to locking down an available deal for
the board to consider as soon as possible, and if required agreeing a short term
extension of up to 3 months to allow the deal to be done avoiding triggering the 2
year exit phase of the current MDA.

The Report

1. What has changed since the September board update?

On Tuesday 12 November RM failed to have a record £50m fine from Ofcom
overturned. The fine, announced in August 2018 related to its actions in 2014 when
Whistl, then known as TNT was trying to become its first competitor in wholesale mail
delivery.

Ofcom’s investigation followed a complaint by Whistl that RM had abused its dominant
market position.

RM challenged the fine, but on the 12"" November 2019 the Competition Appeal Tribunal
dismissed its application sighting that RM had pursued a deliberate strategy of pricing
discrimination against Whistl, which was its only major competitor for delivering
business mail.

In addition to the fine, press coverage suggests Whistl are now looking at options to
decide whether to seek damages.

Royal Mail won its legal challenge to prevent a postal strike after the High Court
backed its application for an injunction on Wednesday 13" November. The grounds for
an appeal are difficult to see, and whilst not impossible it is now increasingly unlikely
that industrial action will take place before Christmas. We do not see this topic
impacting our negotiations at this time.

Royal Mail half year results were announced on 21st November. Group revenue was
up 5.1% and UKPIL revenue up 1.8%, however, adjusted Group operating profit was
down 13.2% to £165m, primarily due to a decline in UKPIL profitability. UKPIL Parcel
revenue was up 5.6%, and volumes up 5%, with Tracked (incl Returns) up 20%.
However, addressed letter volumes were down 5%, and down 8% if you exclude
European parliamentary election mailings. This is outside their forecast range of 5-7%
decline. RMG Share Price initially sunk 17% on the previous day’s trading, losing over
£400m in their market capitalisation. It has since recovered some of those losses, but
it is still down 13% post-H1 Results announcement. These results are likely to place
increased price pressure on our negotiations with RM.

2. What have we achieved in the latest round of negotiations?

Our previously stated minimum requirements for a deal, set out in the May and
September Board paper were;

1. Along term deal with relaxed restrictions in Click and Collect and returns

2. The right to sell RM products online on PO website

3. Any new agreement to contain a level of fixed fee

4. The overall shape of the money to be no less than the current baseline

We have now agreed terms on a range of largely non contentious topics set out in the
table below, with some minor trades of order of magnitude of less than £1m impact
p.a.

Available shape of a possible deal - AGREED TOPICS

Right to sell RM Principle agreed, but working through the detail, and

Agents’ pay Work in progress, RM seeking increased
alignment/transparency

3. What are the remaining sticking points?

The primary sticking points relate to the detail behind the money, Post Office ability to
sell RM products online on the basis of a level playing field, and the approach to change
management

a. The money

The detailed structure behind the proposed move to commission fees for sales and per
item for acceptance is still in discussion, as RM’s proposal presents challenging edge
cases for the Network which would have to be resolved.

We have taken the circa £54m discount RM sought in their opening position off the
table, and are within 2% like-for-like, however through the detailed negotiations we
are looking to close that gap.

Royal Mail wanted to move to a totally variable fee linked to transactions, taking away
the fixed fee element we have today. We have now agreed in principle to support a
move from a Fixed Fee to a Network Access Fee tied to Network size which provides
some variability, but only if a) annual efficiencies that exist today in the Fixed Fee are
removed in the new agreement, and b) that there is no exposure to any discount in
the Access Fee unless our Network reduces to below circa 9,000 branches.

b. Online

In principle we can sell RM products online, but there are ongoing discussions as to
parity on product and proposition. For example if RM moves to offering an integrated
online tracking solution for customers then Post Office must have access to that
proposition. This is to avoid us being tied to an inferior online proposition to RM which
would disadvantage us, and similarly any product RM chooses to sell online that is
available to our customers, we must be able to also sell online, not just the products
we sell today in branch.

c. Change Management

Today the MDA has reasonableness clauses relating to Post Office accepting new
products or changes in its network, allowing sufficient control to protect our network.
Royal Mail is looking to limit Post Office ability to refuse any change requests,
particularly where their driver for a change is driven by regulatory requirements on
them. RM’s opening position was for us to provide any new products or customer
service improvements they require with no ability to refuse.

4. What are our recommended next steps?

We will continue with negotiations with a view to locking down an available deal
for the board to consider as soon as possible.

However to secure the best outcome for Post Office we may need time beyond
the 18'" January 2020 to get to an acceptable deal. In this event we would be
seeking support from the board to postpone the operation of the MDA exit
provisions (which remove restrictions and trigger the exit period) for up to 3
months.

In order to achieve this RM and Post Office would need to agree to an amendment to
the MDA.

For clarity even with a 3 month postponement of the exit provisions we will not allow
that timing to frustrate the opportunity of taking as long as is necessary to get the
best possible deal for Post Office.

RISKS

MITIGATIONS

Reaching a deal within the
renegotiation window set out in the
MDA - The exit provisions of the MDA will
enter into force in 2 months from now
(19'* January 2020), unless RM and PO
agree otherwise by amending the MDA, or
entering into an agreement replacing the
MDA before then.

In the event the exit provisions enter into
force the contract still has two years to run
without restrictions

Not reaching a deal by 18" January 2020
looks increasingly possible, and to mitigate
any risk Post Office proposes if required
extending the current MDA for up to 3
months to the middle of April to support
getting the deal done and avoiding
triggering the 2 year exit phase and the
removal of restrictions.

However Post Office only proposes doing
this where we believe there is sufficient
evidence and confidence that an
acceptable deal is available, as the 18* of
January date has helped provide some
leverage and a burning platform for the
parties to get the deal done.

Unintended consequences of signing
up to a long term deal — A number of
potential risks exist over the longer term,
examples including structural decline in
letters, changes to postal regulation,
increased competition, uncertainty over
future funding of Post Office, Brexit, anda
change of Government.

All these risks have been considered and
some mitigations are already in place,
however for certain risks outside of our
control it is difficult at this time to be clear
about the potential implications e.g. Brexit
or to be able to offer mitigations for those
risks.

However in support of any proposed deal
that we take to the Board for ratification
we will provide a detailed supporting paper
that will set out in detail all the risks and
available mitigations associated with
signing up to a long term deal together
with clear explanation as to why we are
still recommending a long term deal.

Approval of Capex for Telecoms
Customer Routers

Author: Colin Stuart, Finance Director FS&T Meeting date: 26 November 2019

Executive Summary
Context

As part of its Dual ADSL and Dual Fibre customer packages, Post Office provides new
customers with broadband routers and replaces damaged or obsolete ones. Post Office
retains ownership of those routers and requires customers to return them when their
contract ends.

For accounting purposes, the routers are capitalised and treated as fixed assets. This
treatment was put in place in 2013 when the Dual ADSL product was introduced and
extended to Fibre routers when Dual Fibre was introduced in January 2017. The
continued treatment of the routers as fixed assets has been confirmed by the Group
Financial Accounting team.

The Telecoms Budget for 2019/20 was approved by the Board in April 2019 as part of
its approval of the wider Post Office Budget. The Telecoms element of the budget was
for gross income of £158.5m and direct profit contribution of £28.4m. The associated
expenditure on customer routers of £4.83m was included in the capital expenditure
budget presented to the Board in May 2019 as part of the £7.3m “Telco investments”
line. The main drivers of this expenditure on customer routers were gross new Dual
ADSL customers of 112,127 and Dual Fibre customers of 6,857.

To the end of P7 we have spent £2.84m on customer routers, which is £0.22m higher
than budget due to more new Dual Fibre customers being added than budgeted. New
Dual Fibre customers are expected to be added at the current rate for the rest of the
year and, as a result, we expect to spend a further £2.72m on routers, making a total
of £5.56m for the year. This is £0.74m (15%) higher than the budget because more
effective customer acquisition activity is expected to deliver 21,085 new Dual Fibre
customers in the year versus the budget of 6,857.

Following internal audit recommendations made in the first half of 2019/20, the SPO
Governance Team tightened the controls and processes around the approval and
monitoring of funding for all change projects and all Capex and Exceptional Spend. As
a result of those changes and given that the expenditure exceeds £5m, specific Board
approval is required for the expenditure on customer routers.

Approval Sought

We seek specific approval from the Board for the forecast capex spend of £5.56m on
customer routers, which is £0.74m (15%) in excess of the budget amount which the
Board approved in April and May 2019.

Performance Review — Health & Safety
Author: Martin Hopcroft. Sponsor: Lisa Cherry Meeting date: 26 November 2019

Executive Summary

Context

Keeping our employees healthy and safe is fundamental to our success. This is reflected
in the Post Office Board’s legal responsibilities: members of the board have both
collective and individual responsibility for health and safety.

We have a rolling 3-year plan to drive compliance, targeting a reduction in safety
metrics including accidents; lost time accidents (LTIFR); days lost; and personal injury
claims. Our H&S reporting and safety management system has been externally audited
and we also recognise the importance that wellbeing can play in creating engaged and
motivated employees.

Questions addressed in this report

1. What are the trends on accidents and on violence across the Post Office?
2. Are there any significant risks emerging and what are we doing to mitigate?

Conclusion

Following last year’s increase in violent robberies and ATM rip-outs, we have invested
£2.5m in additional fogging and IP camera installations and £0.7m in gas suppression
kit for ATMs. Alarm upgrades are due to be completed by March 2020. The business
has seen a decline in the number of robberies over the last 6 months to Period 7 (50)
compared to the previous six months (93). We have also seen a fall in ATM rip outs and
a fall in losses as the suppression kit has proved effective. There have been 18 ATM
incidents during the 6 months to Period 7 (October) compared to 42 in the previous 6
months. We have two concerns: one immediate and one forecast. There have been 35
incidents so far this year where knives have been carried compared to 23 incidents last
year. We are working urgently through our response, which may require more fogging
equipment, and additional guidance provided to Postmasters. We are also meeting
industry experts to benchmark good practice and mitigation and to review our training
and guidance. In addition, following trends on the continent we are forecasting a shift
from gas attacks on ATMs to dynamite. Destroying cash is the best remedy and we are
close to testing a solution with a supplier.

Safety Performance. (see 5yr perf chart on page 1 of report).

Overall total accidents are down at 43 year to date, compared to 51 in 2018/19 (DMBs

7 in 18/19, a serious accident involving an employee who slipped in a hotel bath (61
days), two physical injuries in Supply Chain due to assaults (15 days) and a broken
wrist following a bracelet catching on a van door (20 days), have led to an increase in
total lost days (121 v 110). Action has been taken to remind colleagues to take care
and we have refreshed lone worker training in H&S Essentials. Lost days due to trauma
following an attack have reduced to 28 days YTD from 141 at the same point last year.

The Supply Chain Safety Plan is progressing well with safety champions sharing best
practice and improvement opportunities at their safety forums. Local risk assessments,
safe systems of work and training continue to be reviewed and strengthened. The BSIA
and Mitie have visited Midway and shared best their approach to ‘hearts and minds’
campaigns and H&S tools and will work with us in November to develop a campaign
which they will share with their wider membership. We met with the Occupational
Health MSK expert to commence an ergonomic review of handling coin and manual
handling activity to identify initiatives to reduce risks facing the ageing workforce.

Property Statutory Compliance (risk assessments / inspections) The overall position
is still being reported as minimal risk, with completed inspections at 96.24%, this
percentage has consistently stayed above 95% since the last quarterly report. The
latest CBRE engineer fabric surveys still suggest a satisfactory (low risk) outcome with
the principal areas still being water ingress through slipped roof tiles, failed flat roofs
and rotten windows. Severe weather in September caused a number of roof leaks,
internal flooding, and plaster and/or ceiling tile failures. We have communicated to
Postmasters, reminding them to check their signage and fascia ahead of the more
extreme winter weather. The latest external Fire Risk Assessments demonstrated
significant improvement in compliance and discussions are continuing with fire experts
Metro Safety to improve our local risk assessment. The latest external fabric surveys
(low risk) still suggest a satisfactory outcome.

Line Managers of support teams are currently completing local risk assessments ie.
workstation, driving and lone worker, to ensure their teams are working compliantly
and any known risks and concerns are mitigated through adjustments and / or provision
of appropriate equipment. The annual H&S module content has been reviewed for
Supply Chain with face to face training introduced for higher risk activities including
manual handling of coin, cages and correct use of equipment.

We have been able to analyse Supply Chain commercial driver telemetry data and
driving behaviour and drive improvement through 121 discussions and coaching. We
are developing a road risk ‘roadmap’ for Company Car drivers, checking licences twice
a year and introducing driver safety packs. Road traffic collisions are slightly down from
59 in 19/20 from 64 (18/19) with blameworthy at 36 (35), 10 of which have been
incurred by Mobile Post Office fleet drivers. Together with audit results, this has given
cause for concern. The fleet team are working with Network colleagues to improve.

The Board are requested to note the current safety performance.

Following an increase in violent robberies, the presence of firearms and a number of
ATM rip-outs earlier last year, funding was approved to install additional fogging kits
and CCTV. A further review of robberies and violence has been undertaken to help us
understand current trends, whether our approach to profiling risk and the current level
of intervention is sufficient, and whether our plan for upgrading branch security and
equipment is robust. Conclusions were shared with PO Board in September.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) and Association of Convenience Stores (ACS)
continue to highlight the increasing threat from violence and abuse in robbery incidents.
In addition to the general crime risk increase, we believe POL will become a more
attractive target as we continue to increase our banking framework due to us
concentrating cash in a number of POL locations on high streets.

Post Office Network robberies currently show a 20% increase YOY (12 month rolling,
143 v 119), however, there has been a reducing trend over the most recent 6 months
(50) compared to the previous 6 months (93). Injuries have been minor and have
slightly reduced from last year YTD (7 vs 9), with approx. 1 injury per 7 incidents.

We continue to see positive results in the ‘High Risk’ robbery programme where we are
installing fogging and IP cameras. Anti-robbery fogging (where activated) and gas
suppression continue to be 100% successful and evidence so far confirms where
activated, criminals will generally flee. Alongside this project, we are at the early stages
of developing a number of cash storage solutions to secure banking deposits simply,
quickly and safely potentially from Nov 19.

ATM gas attacks continue to show signs of slowing partly due to successful gas
suppression activations and lower cash holdings. A number of arrests / convictions
have been made in recent months. Industry and Police are working together to target
ATM crime as this if usually undertaken by Criminal Gangs who are involved in other
criminality (drugs) which ultimately affects the nation’s security. Significant trends
on the continent include using solid explosives, a trend likely to increase in the

UK which makes our roll-out of cash destruction (ink & glue) critical. If this
type of crime targets POL in the future our proposed cash destruction solution can be
upgraded to ensure criminals will not be successful in obtaining useable cash.

CViT robberies have reduced from last year, 35% down YOY (13 v 20) over the rolling
12 month period, and 33% down YTD (8 v 12). However, there were 3 incidents during
period 7. We have rolled out 116 body cameras, 65 CCTV vehicle streaming and 20
tracked I-boxes and our provider is currently developing a glue and ink method of cash
destruction. We are planning to pilot 50 of these across the Chester and Birmingham
areas. A risk assessment is currently being undertaken for the ‘case across counter’
procedure and an approach is being developed by Security, Health & Safety and Supply
Chain to strengthen the secure delivery / collection method at high and medium risk
branches, whilst allowing some flexibility for low risk and rural branches.

We continue to engage with the industry, and recent membership of Safercash will
provide greater access to both CViT and ATM crime data. Grapevine continue to scan
media and social media and we are working closely with the BSIA and other carriers to
review trend data and risk. We review our cross pavement risk assessment annually
and are working with our providers to source and pilot a suitable stab proof vest in
order to respond swiftly should the risk profile change in any particular area.

In response to abusive and aggressive behaviour, temporary IP cameras with automatic
aggression detection will be made on a case by case basis. We are also working closely
with the British Security Industry Association (BSIA) and in November will be meeting
their training partner who are supporting a Met Police programme to share best practice
and guidance across the industry.

What are our Health & Safety priorities for 2019/20

1. To progress the Safety Plan for Supply Chain, development of Safety Champions and
a Safety Forum to develop a ‘hearts and minds’ culture and share best practice.

2. Complete an ergonomic review of lifting and handling in Supply Chain and implement
a range of intervention to mitigate risk to the ageing workforce.

3. To continue the development of our Managers to ensure compliance with safety
calendar activities, completion of training and local risk assessments.

4. To develop branch risk profiling and progress the recommendations from the
Robbery and Violence review and Road Risk Action Plan.

5. Digitalise H&S tools including Accident reporting (ERICA) and the Safety Calendar.

6. Update training content and support the deployment of Harassment by Customers
policy, implementing procedures to reduce risk and likelihood and impact of violence.

7. To review lone working guidelines for Support Centres, guidance to alleviate driver
fatigue and compliance to the mobile phone whist driving policy.

8. Undertake an independent audit of the Property Compliance Framework with support
from HSL/HSE, building on our previous H&S audit.

9. To expand the ‘mental health first aid’ network to provide support to all colleagues.

10.Reintroduce mobile health checks for DMB and Supply Chain colleagues during Q4
and offer flu vaccinations to all colleagues across the business during Q3.
