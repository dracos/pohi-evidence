Model Office Testing Progress Report Final Pass

Progress Report for Model Office Testing - Day 15 & 16
Wednesday 03" and Thursday 04'* March 1999

Management Summary

¢ Test schedule has stabilised after migration activity

¢ A number of issues have been encountered surrounding BES. These are
under investigation, and most of them may be linked to a single
contributing factor

¢ Cash Accounts are still misbalancing, but the causes of each misbalance has
been previously identified, and was therefore expected, as no corrective
action has been applied to the software baseline or test plan

¢ All testing activity complete to schedule

Overall status of MOT testing: GREEN
The management summary status indicators are defined as follows;

Green — No major issues which require escalation outside of the testing arena
Amber _ Testing have serious concerns over quality
Red Major system difficulties have prevented progress

Planned ‘Key’ Counter Activity on day 15 & 16

¢ Stock Unit balancing at all outlets.

¢ Celtic reopens after Temporary closure

e Cash Account production at all outlets

e Planned reference data change - Amendment of product name

Actual ‘Key’ Counter Activity on day 15 & 16
e A number of issues were identified with BES;
¢ Several instances were 2 payments were expected, but only one
was available - initial Pathway investigation indicates a problem
with the PMS service - unconfirmed by CAPS/Horizon
¢ Foreign encashments being refused as ‘Unable to contact HQ’ -
Definitely due to PMS Failure - successfully retested
¢ GRI encashment restricted at counter but available via Helpdesk
¢ Collection of card generates ‘PUN presented at wrong PO’ -
possibly attributed to temporary office closure
¢ No EVP when attempting foreign encashment - again, may be due
to temporary closure
e All other AP, BES, EPOSS and OBCS activity completed without major
incident
