The cumulative performance in financial terms continues to underspend due to the settlement 14.00
of the paydeal below the budgeted level; this will continue throughout the year. The gross hour
‘overspend this month is primarily due to improved processes for the payment of overtime and aa
scheduled attendance payments earned over the Christmas period; this has accelerated
payments, and caused a misalignment with the budget. There have been high variable costs ta00
over the Christmas period, and this is expected to continue in the coming months as service
restoration continues following the industrial action. ‘noo
Permanent staffing is now beginning to increase, this should start to reduce the reliance on
