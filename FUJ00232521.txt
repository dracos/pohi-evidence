1 INTRODUCTION

The TIP Operational Review Book is issued to allow the monthly TIPORF to review the TPS service and the service for reconciliation and
resolution of business incidents.

The report addresses three aspects:

1. Business Incident Resolution performance details how efficiently business incidents are resolved, from receipt to clearance through
to final closure, within the 5 day SLA.

2. Business Incident Analysis identifies any significant root causes which need to be investigated and the actions taken to correct
them.
3. TPS file delivery and transfer times performance considers whether the delivery of SLAs & OLAs were achieved.

Interpretation of data beyond the report label classification can be further qualified by the author as required.

2 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

2.1 BIM Resolution Performance

¢ During October MSU received 20 reconciliation incidents, hence showing a slight decrease when compared to the 26 received in September.
A total of 22 incidents were cleared with I carried forward into September 2002

e Analysis of incidents received by MSU in October shows that the reconciliation SLA remained at 100%. There were 3 incidents suspended in
October.

2.2 BIM Analysis
¢ The report 3.4 OLA graphical analysis is still suspended until resolution of the Lotus laptop account.
e The most frequent type of incident category is APS Incidents of which there were 12 occurrences. Followed by 5 TPS incidents.

¢ The report in section 3.1 shows the ratio of incidents to outlets in October remained constant at 0.001.

2.3 TPS Data & File Delivery Performance

e File transfer times were all achieved before 02:00. All transmissions were achieved within normal timespans except overnight on Monday
28/10/02. There were no specific problems with TIP on that night. However there were problems reported with AP Client BT, whose
resolution would have held up the production of the Client transactions summary.

2.4 File Rejections and Incidents
e 3 file rejections were reported this month. On 1/10/02, the rejection was caused by incorrect reference data which had been applied to the TIP
system. On 9/10/02, a rejection was caused by a problem originating in an equipment swap (see section 5.5 for further details). On 31/10/02,

the problem was caused by incorrect reference data supplied by Post Office Ltd in connection with Hounslow District Council.

¢ Section 5.5 also includes clarification of a previous TIP rejection incident, where the root cause was incorrectly reported in the July service
review book.

Root cause clearance

E-0210020492

58 TIP files were rejected during the evening of 01/10/02. These rejections comprise

(PC0081962) 221 failed cash accounts. Each line of the Cash Account reports an invalid numeric at
field 5, which is the Cash Account Line Number and clearly is numeric. The origin of
this problem seems to stem from an incorrect RDS file that was processed during the
night of 01/10/02 by TIP causing a validation failure.

E-0211010120 52 TIP files have been rejected by the customer. The 52 files contain 1128 "Invalid

(PC0083292), Numeric Value" errors, these are to do with Hounslow rent card transactions. This is

a knock on effect from an error in reference data, whereby the service code for the
client was delivered in the wrong place within the PAN.
