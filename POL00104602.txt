2. INTRODUCTION

The completion of the national roll out of Horizon gives us the opportunity to
take stock of achievements and experiences and provide a means of
transferring incomplete activity to other functions. This process covers the
work to wrap up the project, primarily to prepare input to the Project Board
to obtain its confirmation that the project may close.

2.1. Scope

The purpose of this document is to detail the activity that will accompany the
end of the NRO project. The process to close the project will :-

* ensure that the objectives or aims set out in the Project Initiation Document
have been met

* provide formal confirmation that Horizon implementation activity is
complete

* ensure that adequate arrangements are made for the hand over of any
outstanding or residual activity

* capture lessons resulting from the project and identify any
recommendations for follow-on actions

* prepare a Post Implementation Review

¢ acquire formal project board consent to close and disband the project

2.2 Outputs

The outputs from this paper will be a high level plan which will define the
steps that the NRO project board and management team must undertake to
formally close the project.

3, PROJECT CLOSURE

To confirm that the project has delivered what was expected the NRO project
board will be asked to verify that:-

¢ Horizon implementation activity is complete and meets the needs of the
business

* satisfactory arrangements exist for the transfer of residual
responsibilities to other business units

¢ all project issues are closed or transferred to other functions to follow up
POL00104602
_POL00104602

HORIZON CLOSE DOWN REPORTING Version 0.1
HOR/IMP/STR/003 03/10/00

¢ all relevant project information is secured and archived or handed on as
applicable to permit any future audit of the project’s actions and
performance

* all involved or interested parties are aware that the project is to be
closed and resources disbanded.

The project manager has responsibility for the process and will maintain a
regular dialogue with the project board to ensure that there will be no
problems with its confirmation of the project closure

The key criteria to be applied are:

* Have all elements of the Project Initiation Document been delivered,
subject to any changes that may have been approved during the project
life cycle?

* Are any deviations from the Project Initiation Document addressed in
the project close down report and is the project board still prepared to
accept the project closure? Where appropriate, are any deviations
reflected in the follow-on action recommendations?

¢ Are the project board satisfied that any outstanding project issues have
been baton passed to others to pursue?

« Have gaining business units formally agreed to the transfer of residual
responsibilities and signalled their readiness to accept the work?

¢ Are the project resources and support services not being transferred
elsewhere no longer required?

* Are there any contractual implications when decommissioning the
project?

4. TRANSFER OF RESIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY

The arrangements for undertaking follow on work from the project have
been signed off by the project board and are defined in the Transfer of
Functional Responsibilities paper (PON/IMP/DES/001)

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW (PIR)

It is not strictly a project activity to produce the PIR only to plan it but the
NRO project team are best placed to undertake this. A more formal Post
Project Review to assess achievement of the benefits claimed in the business
case will be done later by the Horizon Commercial team.
HORIZON CLOSE DOWN REPORTING Version 0-1
HOR/IMP/STR/003 03/10/00

The PIR will be structured as follows:-

Background to the project
Performance against aims and objectives
Achievement of plan - timescales
- benefits

Performance - financial

- operational

~ technical
e Learning opportunities
¢ Follow up actions
¢ Recommendations

The following are a sample (not exhaustive) of the questions to be addressed
in the PIR;-

1. Has the project achieved the expected aims and objectives?

2. Are the users happy with all aspects of the specification and quality of
the product?

3. Were the project board arrangements sufficient in all respects to control
and monitor the project?

4. Were all implementation strands, including development activity, fully
and effectively planned, integrated and delivered?

5. Were supplier plans presented in a timely and efficient manner?

6. Did the liaison arrangements with suppliers work well?

7. Did the performance of suppliers meet requirements?

8. Were the field teams happy with what the organisational, management,
logistics and support arrangements for the project?

9. What unexpected problems were encountered during the project?

10. Was the correct calibre of staff used and supervision exercised?

11. Were there adequate arrangements for the recovery of failures and were
contingency plans exist?

12. Was all documentation comprehensive and easy to understand?

13. Did the procedures for managing change requests work effectively and
promptly?

14. Was the training administration and delivery adequate for all
categories of users?

15. Was there an adequate process for all aspects of the project including
remedial activity and compensation payments?

16. Were there any shortcomings in the use of project controls including

management of risks and issues?
17. Was the influencing and communications activity properly planned
and delivered to all relevant parties?

The report will also give:- /
* final statistics on activity undertaken during the project and quality work '

carried out /
* an assessment of the impact of what has been delivered :
* a view on how well the project was managed. '

The lessons learned element of the report will capture what can be learned
from NRO implementation and will be contributed to by everyone involved
with the project. Through this report it is intended to record the salient
highlights of the various management and supplier processes and procedures
which either made a significant contribution to the project’s achievements or
caused a problem. The aim of the report is to answer the question ‘What
should be done differently next time?’ A more detailed account of this
element is contained in Horizon Implementation Learning Points (reference
3).

6. Post Project Review

The Post Project Review, to be completed by the Horizon Commercial team,
will examine achievement against the business case particularly in the context
of benefits realisation and will identify:-

+ what benefit achievements are to be measured
« how the achievement can be measured
* whether any unexpected benefits have been found?

This review will be done after the NRO Project has closed at a time when
benefit achievement can be measured.

Subject: as] Re: HORIZON NRO CLOSE DOWN REPORTING

Don,

Just one comment. The business case for Horizon is wider in scope than the NRO project; hence
the review of benefits will cover the full scope of the business case, Suggested insertion in
section 5 as follows:

It is not strictly a project activity to produce the PIR only to plan it but the NRO project
team are best placed to undertake this. A more formal Post Project Review to assess
achievement of the benefits claimed in the business case will be done later by the
Horizon Commercial team. This PPR will cover the full scope of the Horizon Business
Case, including delivery of CSR and CSR+ functionality as well as NRO.

Regards,
Keith
