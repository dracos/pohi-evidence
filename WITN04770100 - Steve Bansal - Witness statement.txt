2. This witness statement is made on behalf of Fujitsu to assist the Post Office IT Inquiry

   with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request provided to Fujitsu on 11 March 2022



3. The topics set out in the Inquiry's Request of which I have knowledge relate to events

   that took place more than a decade ago. These topics principally relate to training

   and testing. I have tried to recall these events to the best of my ability. However, given

   the length of time, there may be certain matters where my recollection is more limited.

5. While at Peritas, I conducted training for various projects including Pathway. Given

   the events i discuss in this statement happened around 25 years ago, I cannot say

   with complete certainty which aspects of the training I delivered related solely to

   Pathway. I have drafted this witness statement to the best of my knowledge.

   to the sub-postmasters how the system worked and answering any questions that the



   that the attendees raised, but I would have answered any I could within the session

   or asked the attendees to write down their questions and have someone from the

   Peritas office answer the question.

7. After the training sessions sub-postmasters signed a form to confirm they had taken

   part and completed the training. I am not able to remember the content of the training

   or level of detail but I recall asking the attendees if they understood and felt

       was that the POL Training was aimed at providing a flavour of the activities

       undertaken by sub-postmasters in the branches and allow us to appreciate the

       manual tasks and form filling required and better support the sub-postmasters.



       attendees received any new counter terminals and whether the training I delivered

       was actually implemented. While I cannot comment on why this happened, I believe

       that the initial training materials that the Peritas team and I drafted were I believe



       developments from the system that came a year later. I never saw the content of the

       later training material so am unable to comment on which aspects of the training in

       rejoined, I started in the test team and later moved to the service team as a problem

       manager in around 2010, when I became a full-time employee.

TESTING

   a number of test environments, such as functional and non-functional test rigs.

   testing focused on components of the software) and then Component Integration

   move into System Validation and Integration ("SV&I") and live systems testing ("LST")

   for functional testing such as, Unit test (testing of smalllsingle software modules),

   Smoke test (testing stability ready for next phase), Regression test (testing existing

   code has not been impacted by changes in code) and non-functional testing such as,

   Failover (testing ability to move functions), Disaster Recovery (testing continuation of



   responsiveness and stability), and Volume (testing large volumes of data).

16. 1 was not involved in the entire end-to-end test lifecycle but would only be involved in

   the aspects that were relevant to my role at the time. In my role as trainee tester, I

   was given scripts to run in order to test the equipment and/or counter. I would then

   record the result of the test and feed the results back to the Fujitsu test manager. It

   is my understanding that the Fujitsu test manager would communicate the results of

   the tests with the relevant Post Office test manager.

17.Although I was new to testing at the time, with hindsight, the testing process seemed

   thorough from what I can remember. For example, there were regular reviews, which

   would highlight any areas that required further work, retesting and/or rescripting.

   When I ran the scripted tests that were assigned to me by my manager, I recorded

   those that passed, those that deferred (not able to run at the time) and those that

18. Asa trainer, we sought feedback from sub-postmasters in relation to the training they

   received. Once we had completed the training, the sub-postmaster would complete

   two forms. The first would state that the sub-postmaster had received the training,

   which they would sign to confirm this. The second was a feedback form, inviting the

   sub-postmasters to provide feedback on the trainers, which may have included

   from time to time, receive feedback reviews from my Peritas manager at the time,

   believe it covered areas such as course content, delivery of the training, speed of

   delivery of the training, physical environment of the training session, and overall

   postmasters understood the training.

20. I'm not able to comment if end users were sufficiently involved in the requirements

   definition, design or acceptance testing as I had limited exposure or involvement

   outside of my role at the time. What I can say is that over time Post Office have




   specific dates or names for this.

22. During my time with the test team, I was based in Feltham with a machine with

   restricted access. However interaction with the Fujitsu system teams was very good.

   The teams were always engaging, keen to discuss and understand issues first-hand.
