I assume that the papers will be with me tomorrow morning. If so I suggest that we have a con at say 11 AM
tomorrow as this will give me a chance to read them through properly.

Clare Wardle is now aware of this matter.
Iam attending a meeting with David Smith, Tony Utting and Clare on Friday to discus this case but also to plan a

way forward so this type of problem does not occur again. David is the General Manger for Information
Technology within Post Office Ltd and Tony is Head of Security for POL.

It will take place at Calthorpe House Go-eu-r eerie seh corenen-rrewn-eed this Friday at 10.30 and it may be

useful for you and or Stephen to attend.

I have called and left a message. I will try again later this afternoon.
The points I wanted to discuss are (in short form):

1) a full set of papers is being prepared for you.

2) I suggest that you Stephen Dilley and me have a con' call at your convenience to discuss and plan the next
steps in this matter.

3) an updated spread sheet is being prepared listing all Horizon related cases. From my end your are aware of
Blakey and Patel. We can discuss the level of information you require on each or all of the Horizon related matters
when we speak.

4) I have put out to the team the message that there are to be no proceedings issued relating to a Horizon based
claim without your knowledge and "ok".

Please let me know when it would be convenient to hold a con call as suggested above.
