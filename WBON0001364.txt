Dear Sirs

POST OFFICE GROUP LITIGATION
RE WAIVER OF PRIVILEGE POL-0218577

We refer to your letter dated 14 November 2018.

We do not understand how the word “Zebra” is said to be, or could conceivably be, privileged. The
redaction of this word raises concerns as to the approach to redactions taken more generally, in
circumstances in which the Court has sought an explanation of the basis on which redactions to
other documents have been made. Accordingly, we do not agree to the amendment of the document
title on Magnum, which has been visible to the Judge and the parties for many weeks.

Yours faithfully
