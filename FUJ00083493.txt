[Start of Response]

hen the variance is checked following a cash declaration, the system compares the declared amount against the expected amount
(i.e. the opening cash figure for the period adjusted by all cash movements since then).

Ii have checked the system figures again the declared figures for stock unit AA since the rollover on 7th November and can confirm
that all the variances reported since then have been calculated correctly. There are no known issues that would result in the
ariance being incorrect.

for example, on 7th Nov, the opening cash figure after rollover was £60125.

22300 was remmed in
6500 was transferred out
single SC transaction £11183.60 in

jo at this point there should be £87038.60 in the drawer
cash declared at 15:29: £81580 i.e. £5528.60 short (though the variance wasn't checked at this point)

fk can't tell why the declared cash doesn't match the expected cash figure, the branch need to make sure that what they have
jrecorded on the system is correct, and investigate the anomalies.

Please pass this information back to NBSC.
