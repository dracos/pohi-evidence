Executive Summary

1.1 Horizon Online Core Summary

1.4.4

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential — Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT

In assessing the Horizon Online system, our work has focused on a broad suite of controls which, in
collaboration, work to assure that the integrity of transactional data is maintained from branch to
Audit Store. The controls respond to the fundamental risks of data integrity which are:

1.1.1.1. Completeness - All data is transmitted from source to destination in its entirety.
1.1.1.2 Accuracy — Data is accurately transmitted from source to destination without change.

1.1.1.3 Validity - The data is valid and has not been doctored or changed such that it is no longer
representative of the information the original data was recorded to capture, or has been
created spuriously and not linked to a real life data generating event.

The system controls across the areas of the Horizon Online system we have examined are robust at
the point our work was conducted with minimal exceptions noted from our testing. They are
appropriate to a system the size and scale of Horizon, and the distributed electronic point of sale
(EPOS) function it performs. The system controls have been designed to meet a high standard of
control and have been assessed similarly in the reports of other independent assurance
organisations such as Ernst and Young (Service Auditor Report) - although not specifically in the
context of responding to these allegations.

Our work has focused on the core data flow within Horizon Online, from the Counter in branch to the
Audit Store. We focussed on this particular core data flow because it is this data flow which leads to
the initial capture of transaction data and its subsequent long term storage and, in the event of an
issue or challenge, data is downloaded from the Audit Store to enable Post Office to carry out an
investigation. This data flow is subject to industry standard cryptographic controls which are
automated, inherent system controls and they are applied by the system to each and every
transaction processed by the Counter. They represent the most reliable control type possible over
data integrity - they are hardcoded into the system and no manual intervention is required for them
to operate. As a consequence of being inherent to the technology they have been in operation
throughout the life of Horizon Online

Working together, the Digital Signature (paragraph 1.3.3.1 (d)) and JSN (paragraph 1.3.3.1 (c))
controls respond to the fundamental data integrity risks of Completeness, Accuracy and Validity and
make it extremely unlikely that the record of transactions contained within the Audit Store is not
representative of the transactions input by staff in branch. As with all large scale computer systems.
whilst it is theoretically possible that glitches and coding errors in the system could have resulted in
errors in the recording of transactions to occur, the likelihood of such errors occurring in a manner
which has adversely affected only certain branches materially whilst not affecting other branches at
all / minimally is in our view remote given the controls in place. The testing we have performed over
these controls was designed and executed to assess their operation in responding to these
fundamental risks. Noting the assumptions and limitations detailed in section 1.5, this testing has not
resulted in any matters being identified that would call into question the integrity of the core data
flow within Horizon Online from the Counter in branch to the Audit Store.

While we have identified an exception in the cryptographic controls (paragraph 1.4.2.10 and
1.4.2.11) which would theoretically allow a malicious actor to undermine them and potentially
change data, it is limited to a third party (Fujitsu) and would be technically very challenging to
achieve. It would require significant motivation for one of the limited set of Fujitsu staff members to
exploit this vulnerability given the technical challenges and risks of tripping monitoring controls and,
although we have not performed procedures in this area, it would almost certainly require collusion
with Post Office staff or Postmasters. Although our investigations have not been exhaustive, they
have been extensive and we have seen no such evidence of malicious misuse of the system.

1.2 The Allegations

1.2.1 Post Office and the legal firm acting on behalf of Post Office (Womble Bond Dickinson) have
informed us that the Claimants in the Group Litigation have asserted that Post Office / Fujitsu has
the ability to add / delete / change transactions recorded by branches without the consent /
knowledge of a Postmaster and that this may have been the cause of discrepancies in some of the
Claimants’ branch accounts. We understand that the allegation has been formulated in several
different ways:-

1.2.1.1 Post Office / Fujitsu have the ability to log on remotely to a Horizon terminal in a branch
so to conduct transactions.

1.2.1.2 Post Office / Fujitsu have the ability to conduct transactions (either remotely or locally)
under another user's ID.

1.2.1.3. Post Office / Fujitsu have the ability to insert transactions into a branch's accounts without
either a Postmaster's (a) knowledge or (b) consent.

1.2.1.4 Post Office / Fujitsu have the ability to amend or delete transactions entered by branch
staff on Horizon (and can do so in a way that is hidden from Postmasters).

1.2.2 More generally, we are informed that the Claimants also allege that Horizon makes errors in
accurately recording the transactions input by Postmasters.

1.2.3 We have also been told that the Claimants have made a variety of other allegations, principally
relating to Horizon providing a poor user experience or having insufficient safeguards against user
error. Testing the user experience and safeguards in place to protect against user error was not
within the scope of our work.

1.3 Overview of Horizon and Our Approach

1.3.1. Horizon is the core operational and Electronic Point of Sales platform for the Post Office network.
Although the system has been in use for over 15 years, it is important to note that in 2010 there was
a migration from the system commonly referred to as ‘Legacy Horizon’ to the online variant that is
operated today ("HNG-X" or "Horizon Online"). We have been informed by Fujitsu that the key
difference between the two variants is the way in which data is stored; local versus central. Below is
an overview of Horizon Online.

1.3.2 A diagram showing the high level flow of data from transaction origination through to the Audit Store
is set out in section 3 (Background). In summary:-

1.3.2.1. Transactions conducted on Horizon terminals in branches are bundled into virtual baskets
(i.e. one basket of transactions per customer) and securely transferred over the internet to
the Branch Database (BRDB). The BRDB is hosted on a central server farm operated by
Fujitsu (there is more than one BRDB server for resilience, and a set of gateway servers
collectively termed the Branch Access Layer (BAL) are also used).

1.3.2.2 Camelot, Paystation, and Post & Go transactions are conducted on their own separate
terminals (hence they are often referred to as Non-Counter transactions) and accepted into
the BRDB by way of Transaction Acknowledgments (TAs) on a daily basis.

1.3.2.3 The BRDB holds the live version of the transaction data used in day to day operations.
Fujitsu also hosts other centralised data services to support reporting activities which are
drawn from summarised data on BRDB.

1.3.2.4 From the BRDB, transaction data is fed into various other Post Office systems that then
connect to various third party systems.

1.3.2.5 The transaction records in the BRDB are also transferred to the Audit Store via the Audit
Server. The Audit Store is not involved in the live operation of a branch or Post Office's
business. It is the long term repository of transaction data. In the event of a challenge to
the integrity of any transaction data, the Audit Store is considered to be the master record.
In usual circumstances, it holds that data for 7 years but this has been extended to 10
years owing to the Group Litigation, and this is now reviewed on an annual basis.

POL00253246
POL00253246

1.3.3. There are a number controls in place to protect the integrity of transaction data within Horizon (i.e.

from the Counter to the Audit Store):-
1.3.3.1 Counter transactions:-

(a) must balance to zero (e.g. the value of payment taken or given by the branch equals
the value of goods and services provided);

(b) are atomically written (i.e. entirely or not at all) to the BRDB so that there can be no
partial transactions; and

(c) are each given a unique Journal Sequence Number (JSN) of 1 greater than the
previous transaction so that the completeness (density) of the flow of transactions from
a particular branch can be checked when data is extracted from the Audit Store.

(d) are signed by a digital signature, which in accordance with commonly adopted
cryptography techniques, is used to secure the integrity of transactional data once it
has been initiated at the counter and allows all transactions to be checked for
subsequent interference once they have left the counter.

1.3.3.2 I Non-Counter transactions:-

(a) must be accepted into the BRDB by branch staff by way of a TA in order to affect the
branch accounts. Branch staff can obtain reports from the Camelot, Paystation and
Post & Go terminals and compare those reports to the TAs that they are asked to
accept; and

(b) are digitally signed and subject to JSN fingerprinting by the Counter after being
accepted and those digitally signed files can be compared against raw data files that
are interfaced into the Audit Store in order to verify completeness when data is
extracted from the Audit Store (i.e. once they have been accepted by the Postmaster
non-Counter transactions are subject to the same data integrity controls as counter
transactions).

Due to the nature of the allegations and the investigations that they have necessitated, we have
carried out work in phases and, within each phase, scope areas. The main body of this report
contains a summary of the work that we have been asked to do, and then designed, in each phase
and scope area and that shows how the overall project has expanded and developed. However, the
purpose of this Executive Summary is to outline our overall findings and apply them to the
allegations set out in section 1.2 above. We also provide a summary of the procedures performed
and the findings of each stage of the work.

In broad terms, we have performed five methods of investigation:-

1.3.5.1 reviewing Horizon technical documentation provided by Fujitsu;

1.3.5.2 asking questions of key Fujitsu staff;

1.3.5.3 reviewing transaction and event data generated by Horizon;

1.3.5.4 testing controls, such as walking through some of the Horizon processes on screen with
Fujitsu; and

1.3.5.5 analysis of Horizon's source code.

1.4 Our Findings

1.4.1

1.4.2

As the way data was handled by Horizon changed materially in 2010 with the introduction of Horizon
Online, legacy Horizon and Horizon Online need to be addressed separately.

Horizon Online

1.4.2.1 When branch staff lookup transaction records, the terminal in branch contacts the BRDB
to retrieve the necessary information. Given that branch accounts (as seen and operated

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential — Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 4
POL00253246
POL00253246

in branch by Postmasters) draw on data from the BRDB, additions, edits or deletions in the
BRDB could impact upon branch accounts.

1.4.2.2 The integrity of transaction data (as recorded in branch and then communicated via the
BRDB to the Audit Store) is protected in the following ways-

(a) Counter transactions (i.e. those transactions that originate in branch due to the actions
of branch staff) are given a unique number of 1 greater than the previous transaction so
that the data can be checked for missing or duplicate transactions;

(b) Counter transactions are also digitally signed (i.e. a unique “hash” is applied to each
message) so that the accuracy and validity of the transaction data can also be checked;

(c) Non-Counter transactions (i.e. those generated by TAs that originate from Post Office)
must be accepted by branch staff before they enter into the BRDB. Once accepted, the
TA is digitally signed by the Counter and sent to the BRDB and then on to the Audit
Store;

(d) The original non-Counter raw data file in respect of non-Counter transactions is also
sent direct to the Audit Store and the digitally signed file from the BRDB can be
compared to the raw date file to check its integrity (this has been represented by Fujitsu
to be the case but not tested during the course of our work);

(e) When data is sent from the BRDB to the Audit Store via the Audit Server it is sealed
(while in the Audit Server) and a database of sealed files is maintained so that when
data is subsequently retrieved from the Audit Store, its integrity can be checked. The
mechanism to do this (MD5 hashing algorithm) was previously a well adopted industry
standard mechanism. Although this is now a technically obsolete (in that for encryption
purposes it can be cracked relatively easily) significant technical expertise would still be
required to exploit this vulnerability; and

Indirectly the integrity of the transaction data is protected by the interface of BRDB data
on a regular basis to downstream systems (some of these feeds for a number of
products are in real time) and therefore interception and adjustment of data would have
to concurrently update BRDB and downstream data sources to remain in alignment and
prevent being subsequently spotted.

1.4.2.3 Setting aside the "remote access" issues discussed below, in our view:

(a) controls are in place to support the integrity of the processing of data from the Counter
into BRDB and the Audit Store. The level and design of the controls is proportionate to
a system of the size, scale, usage and data sensitivity, of Horizon;

(b) it is very unlikely that the data input by branch staff and as recorded in the BRDB and
the Audit Store would be incomplete or inaccurate.

(c) in the event that data was incomplete or inaccurately recorded, the controls in Horizon
provide tools that can be used to effectively identify such issues; and

(d) therefore a suitably skilled and qualified person could review the raw data from the
Audit Store to determine whether any data was incomplete or inaccurate (as a result of
one of the actions set out at 1.2), and when data is extracted from the Audit Store a
number of checks are performed to validate the completeness and accuracy of the data
(none of which have been flagged to us as failing by Post Office or Fujitsu in the
extraction of data relevant to this case).

1.4.2.4 In response to the allegations referred to in section 1.2 above, we would highlight that our
testing supports the following assertions (subject to the limitations in section 1.5 below):

(a) Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu have the ability to log on remotely to a Horizon terminal
in a branch so to conduct transactions.

(b) Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu employee's! tor administrators have the abilitv.to
conduct transactions (either remotely or locally) under another employee 's 1D (unless
that employee Shares their password but this would be a breach of operational

procedure). As with the majority of computer systems there are some generic accounts
(service accounts, or other accounts named so not specifically assigned to a specific
employee!

(c) Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu have the ability to inject additional transactions into a
branch's accounts, through normal system functionality, without either a Postmaster's
(a) knowledge or (b) consent (however see 1.4.2.5 below).

This is with one exception for a small group of Fujitsu users (30 users) who may do so
via Balancing Transactions (BTs):

(i) BTs do not require formal acceptance through the Horizon terminal by branch staff
(unlike transaction corrections and transaction acknowledgements) and so can be
pushed into the branch accounts by Fujitsu.

(ii) We reviewed a population of B’ Ts since the inception of Horizon HNG-X extracted
from the Audit Store by [Fujitsu] and this highlighted that there had only been one
usage of BTs for general data correction in this period (at a branch not associated
with the allegations). BTs are used more routinely (although still infrequently — 1,643
instances during the period of approximately 6 years) to update a flag which can
become locked in the wrong binary setting (1, 0), preventing updates to stock units
within a branch.

Fujitsu (but not Post Office) has the ability to add, amend or delete transactions entered by
branch staff on Horizon via Privileged Users outside of specific functionality of the Horizon
application.

A limited number of authorised Fujitsu personnel (19 at the Operating System layer and 26
at the database layer at the time of testing - May 2016) have sufficient privileges to
theoretically add / delete / change data in the BRDB (“Privileged Users”). However, see
paragraph 1.4.2.10 below regarding the segregation of access conditions. These users
may also have access to other systems, such as the Audit Store, however in relation to the
allegations, access to the BRDB is the most important as it is the BRDB that generates the
branch accounts and is the source of the data ultimately used by Post Office to investigate
shortfalls.

Post Office personnel do not have this Privileged User access and Fujitsu and Post Office
have asserted that they have never had such access, however there is no historic record
of all the Privileged Users that there have ever been, so this cannot be verified.

Changes to a branch's transaction data in the BRDB by Privileged Users would be visible
to branch staff. The amended transaction would show up in transaction reports produced
in branch but would not be flagged as a change by a Privileged User and to the best of our
knowledge would appear like a normal transaction generated in branch (although see
paragraph 1.4.2.14 below around database logging of the actions of Privileged Users).

We would expect a system such as Horizon to have this type of Privileged User access as
it will be used to undertake maintenance on the system or to implement updates. Such
access comes with a risk of it being misused, either by accident or maliciously. It is
impossible to eliminate this risk entirely (within Horizon or any other IT system) and so
systems generally have controls over the use of privileged access so as to reduce the risk
or misuse or to make it detectable.

A key control in Horizon is the segregation of access permissions between Privileged
Users who can access the BRDB and those users who may access the Key Management
Server (KMS). The KMS holds the digital keys that underpin the controls listed in
paragraph 1.4.2.2. Segregation of Privileged Users from KMS users means that a
Privileged User cannot get around the controls in paragraph 1.4.2.2 and therefore cannot
cover up any changes they make in the BRDB (Controls 1.4.2.2 b, c, d and e are of
particular importance). If a proper segregation of duties is in place, any changes by a
single Privileged User to the BRDB would be detectable in line with paragraphs 1.4.2.2 b,
c, d and e above. This does not eliminate the risk of misuse entirely as there could be a
conspiracy between a Privileged user and a KMS user.

POL00253246

1.4.2.11 Through our enquiries, we have identified that 25 current Privileged Users have access to
the KMS such that they could theoretically cover up any changes made to the BRDB data.
This is a failure by Fujitsu to implement its own segregation of duties policy. We are
unable to determine how long this vulnerability has existed as records of historic users are
not kept and as far as we are aware it has not been fixed by Fujitsu.

1.4.2.12 Despite this vulnerability there are a number of other factors to consider in determining the
likelihood that actions by a Privileged User would be the cause of shortfalls in a branch.

1.4.2.13 First, Horizon has functionality (in the form of transaction corrections and balancing
transactions) to resolve the significant majority of imaginable operational errors in branch
or technical errors in Horizon. There is therefore little need to use privileged access to
manipulate transaction data to resolve an error — such use would be a last resort and
outside of mandated process (Balancing Transactions in particular are a deliberately
engineered process to support the exceptional corrective processing that less controlled
privileged access would typically be used for).

1.4.2.14 Fujitsu have advised us that there is a key split in dates around the audit trail of Privileged
User usage in July 2015:

(a) Pre July 2015 - only Privileged User log on and log offs were logged. However these
are expected to be of a low volume and would always (if valid ‘accesses’) be approved
by a documented access request form.

(b) Post July 2015 — fuller transaction audit logging was enabled by Fujitsu. A reviewer
could always see the last action by a Privileged User. If a Privileged User deleted their
actions, it would always leave a footprint of the deletion of logs. They could
theoretically remove what they have done, but they cannot remove that they have done
something.

1.4.2.15 Fujitsu have advised us during the course of testing that turning off audit logs completely
would ‘break’ the application, causing it to crash and become un-functional. We have not
performed any testing to validate this assertion. A ‘Delete’ record on the audit trail is likely
to be highly unusual and easy to spot, and should facilitate further testing should it be
required.

1.4.2.16 Second, subject to the circumstances described in paragraph 1.4.2.17 immediately below,
any change to a branch's transactions in the BRDB by a Privileged User would be visible
to Post Office, Fujitsu and branch staff through the reports available from the system.
Further, Fujitsu has the data and, they have informed us, the expertise to identify that the
root cause of the change was the actions of a Privileged User via interrogation of the audit
trails maintained on such activity and a likely lack of coherency between amended data
and the records of that data within other systems. This means that if a Privileged User
had materially changed a branch's transaction data via unauthorised mechanisms, it is
likely that it would be spotted and resolved; any unauthorised a User chi cf
regardless of materiality, would be identified by [describe the control: ¢ 4.2.17(d)) IF
transactions were checked.

1.4.2.17 Third, there is a theoretical risk of a Privileged User maliciously changing a branch's data
and successfully covering up that fact that those changes were made by the Privileged
User (due to Fujitsu's failure to segregate duties) but in our view the risk is unlikely to
crystallise because, in summary (a more detailed outline of the steps that a Privileged
User would have to take is in section 4.7.2 within the table).

(a) There are a limited number of Privileged Users (25 at the time of testing - June 2016)
who could theoretically (due to the segregation of duties breach between database
administration and the key management server) amend the Message Log for one or
more Counters in one or more branches and make the transaction/s amended, look
legitimate when it is retrieved from the Audit Store (through spoofing of the digital
signature);

(b) However , this would require an existing systems administrator with a large amount of

technical expertise and systems knowledge, it would almost certainly require a program
to be installed onto the Horizon online system and a release process would have to be

bypassed in order for this to be installed maliciously (and avoid file integrity checking
controls operated by Fujitsu);

(c) There is also a time restriction of under 24 hours where the amendment of the
message log would have to complete by (likely to be a much smaller time window of
opportunity for the majority of transaction types where there is real-time or near real-
time processing -for example a number of postal transactions generate a ‘Track and
Trace’ message as they are carried out in the branch and these messages are sent to
Royal Mail/Parcelforce in near real time). This is because such real-time or near real-
time processing would copy data to other data sources and as a result expose data
which had been edited post such transfer, through lack of coherency between differing
data sources;

(d) Further since July 2015 there will always be a record of a Privileged User amending
transactions in this way due to audit logging always logging DELETE actions (even if a
Privileged User deleted their actions this action would be logged). Pre-July 2015 there
will be logs of Privileged User log and log offs to the Horizon system databases,
Privileged User log on / offs should be inherently rare, and would (if legitimate
accesses) always be accompanied by a request for access and appropriate approvals;
and

(e) Although we have not performed procedures in this area, it would almost certainly
require collusion with Post Office staff or Postmasters and the impacts would be to a
branch’s accounts or Post Office’s P&L, rather than benefitting them persona

1.4.2.18 In light of the above, it seems unlikely that a Privileged User would have the motivation or
the ability to do this.

1.4.3. Legacy Horizon

1.4.3.1. The old Horizon system was named ‘Riposte’. This was a third party supplied product
which provided a similar functionality and service as the current Horizon system, but with a
number of important distinctions, in the context of the allegations detailed in Section 1.2 of
this Executive Summary above:

(a) On the Riposte system the data was held locally on a Branch Server and then
replicated to a cluster of central servers overnight. On HNG-X a key principle is branch
data is only held centrally (on the BRDB).

(b) A Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) function provided functionality similar to the digital
signature in that it provided a checksum capability. A checksum applies a
predetermined algorithm to a set of data to produce an output. When transmitted or
held with the data the checksum algorithm can be reapplied to validate whether the
dataset is complete and accurate. Unlike the digital signature applied by Horizon to
Counter transactions, this is not cryptographically secure and technically competent
people can generate CRCs simply (i.e. it is at greater risk of tampering).

(c) Once data was received from a branch server by the centralised server farm it would
be duplicated to all nodes in the farm (they were four clusters), meaning that
challenges in terms of altering the data would likely still exist (as data would now be
different between different nodes), causing a data integrity issue which would be likely
to generate system errors and be noticed if only one location was updated.

(d) Riposte was a third party provided system, meaning that neither Fujitsu nor Post Office
would have been likely to have ready access to the source code of the application.
Access to source code is an imperative requirement to being able to change the
underlying code or functionality of the application and the fact that Post Office or
Fujitsu would have probably had to approach the vendor in order to do so, would
inherently lower the risk of malicious changes to the application from privileged users
(although not necessarily the amendment of transactions data within the system).

(e) The Audit Store technology was largely identical to the instance supporting Horizon
HNG-X at the point of adoption (including the audit server).

POL00253246
POL00253246

(f) Fujitsu have stated that due to (b), (c) and (d) above an application would need to be
inserted onto a branch server to manipulate transactions prior to them being distributed
to the datacentre and that whilst there is a theoretical possibility this could be achieved,
it is considered by Fujitsu to be a ‘remote possibility’.

1.4.3.2 Our assessment of Riposte was largely dependent on interviews with Fujitsu SMEs and a
review of the available technical documentation. Given the time that has elapsed and
because there is no system to perform direct controls testing or substantive procedures on,
our ability to test this system was very limited.

1.4.3.3 We did perform some analysis of the baskets generated by Riposte which *Gentified
0.0015% of transactions had ‘errors’ and did not balance. It was subsequently
demonstrated these were false positives as set out in section 2.2.1 (i.e. they were not
actually errors). RS explained in section 4.5.2 below, further sample testing work was
undertaken on the 48 items and it was established that none of the items originally noted
were issues when looking at fresh extracts of the system data — the original extracts
provided were out of balance as they had not been extracted correctly.

1.5 List of Assumptions and Limitations

1.1.1. Where we have reviewed technical documentation we are reliant on the accuracy of the information
contained within the reports reviewed.

1.1.2 Where we have interviewed with Fujitsu and Post Office SMEs, we are reliant on the accuracy of
the information provided by these individuals.

1.1.3 We have only performed procedures over the areas of system functionality that we believe to be
relevant to the allegations set out in section 1.2, based upon the review of technical documentation
set out in Appendix 1 and interviews with Fujitsu and Post Office SMEs.

1.1.4. Our work has utilised sample testing to support the operation of controls and substantive
procedures. Whilst sample testing is a useful tool for assessing an overall population, there is a
possibility that our samples and the conclusions we have derived from them are not representative
of the overall population. Samples selected to support the controls testing were aligned to Deloitte's
standard methodology for sample selection, based upon the frequency of operation of the control.

2. Management Summary

2.1 Background and Scope

Post Office continues to respond to allegations that the Horizon IT system used to record transactions in Post
Office branches is defective and the processes associated with it are inadequate (the “Allegations”). The
Allegations span a period of over 15 years, some pre-date 2000 and others relate to the present day. In response
to the commencement of litigation proceedings, Deloitte was originally instructed to plan and execute procedures
and respond to three scope areas supporting Post Office’s ability to understand how Horizon (HNG-X) has been
operated to prevent incorrect system operation that could have resulted in Postmaster detriment.

After the completion of the initial procedures (Phase 0 and Phase 1) over the three scope areas, it was identified
that further investigations would be required following the identification of exceptions in key controls tested by
Deloitte and the identification of key areas of risk. As such, Deloitte was instructed to provide responses to specific
questions to aid Post Office's ability to understand a number of areas within Horizon (HNG-X), namely:

1. The usage of Privileged Users and the configuration of audit logs (specifically over the actions of
Privileged Users, including audit logs over Riposte); and
2. The control environment over Non-Counter Transactions.

All procedures performed throughout the various phases of work have been designed to assess the level of
relevant risks surrounding financial loss to Postmasters or levels of reliance that can be placed on data used by
case handlers.

It should be noted that this report is to be considered a ‘living’ document, and in its current format represents the
final format following the completion of Phases 0 — 4. Future updates may be required if additional work is scoped
in at a future date.

2.1.1 Phase 0 and Phase 1
The scope areas over which Deloitte was originally instructed to perform procedures are as follows:

1. Scope Area 1 - To carry out an analysis of the relevant transaction logs for branches within the Complaint
Review & Mediation Scheme (the “Scheme”) to confirm, insofar as is possible, whether any bugs in the
Horizon system are revealed by the dataset which caused discrepancies in the accounting position for any
of those branches (see 2.2.1).

2. Scope Area 2 - To carry out a full review of the use of Balancing Transactions throughout the lifetime of
the Horizon system and, insofar as is possible, to independently confirm from Horizon system records the
number and circumstance of their use (see 2.2.2).

3. Scope Area 3 - To carry out a full review of the controls over the use and capability of authorised Fujitsu
personnel to create, amend or delete baskets within a sealed Audit Store throughout the lifetime of the
Horizon system, insofar as is possible (see 2.2.3).

Against each of these three scope areas the main body of this report will outline further:

1. Background and context in relation to this engagement;

2. The approach Deloitte have taken to planning the procedures;

3. The testing procedures Post Office have, upon Deloitte’s recommendation and with agreement of Post
Office and their advisors, requested Deloitte undertake in response to the planning activities; and

4. Results of these testing procedures.

2.1.2 Phase 2

This additional phase of work constituted ‘Phase 2’, the ‘Further Investigations Phase’, whereby Deloitte performed
procedures it recommended and agreed with Post Office and their advisors in response to certain findings or
outcomes of ‘Phase 0’ and ‘Phase 1’ against the three scope areas examined during that phase.

The three additional scope areas were:

1. Additional Scope Area 1 — To perform an investigation of Privileged User Audit Logs from Branch
Database, the controls over them, and corresponding data extract and interrogation options (see 2.2.4).

2. Additional Scope Area 2 - To perform an investigation of analytics test results 1: ‘Identify Gaps in Audit
Logs Sequencing’, and 6: ‘Identify branches which are out of balance based on transactional data
available’ (see 2.2.5).

3. Additional Scope Area 3 - To perform an investigation of controls over the integrity of non-Counter
initiated transactions, e.g. Paystation (see 2.2.6).

2.1.3 Phase 3

This additional phase of work constituted ‘Phase 3’, the ‘Non-Counter Transactions Phase’ whereby Deloitte
performed procedures it recommended and agreed with Post Office and their advisors in relation to Non-Counter
transactions to provide an assessment against the following questions:

1. Are there any gaps in the controls around Non-Counter transactions that could call into question the
Integrity of the data generated in relation to these transactions? (see 2.2.7)
2. If there are gaps (see 2.2.8):

a. Could they be the cause of discrepancies in branch accounts (or could they mean that errors in
Horizon would not be revealed and those errors could then be the cause of discrepancies in
branch accounts); and

b. What is the risk of those gaps (or resulting discrepancies) materialising?

2.1.4 Phase 4

This additional phase of work constituted ‘Phase 4’, whereby Deloitte performed procedures it recommended and
agreed with Post Office and their advisors in relation to the Fujitsu Report ‘Database Security in Horizon Online’,
specifically:

1. Deloitte review of Fujitsu Report in conjunction with initial comments raised (see 2.2.9).
2. Workshop with appropriate Fujitsu resource (see 2.2.10) to:
c. Answer any outstanding comments / questions on the report.
d. Produce a detailed commentary on what steps would need to be taken to replace the message
log, as per Section 2 of the Fujitsu report (reproduced in Appendix 9).

2.2 Summary of Results

A summary of the key controls tested and the results of that testing are set out below for all Phases (1-4 - Note
Phase 0 was a planning phase to determine the procedures needed for Phase 1 and so did not produce testing
results in its own right, hence it is not referenced below). A full set of agreed procedures tested and associated
results has been included in Section 4 of this report. These should be reviewed in tandem with the assumptions
and limitations that have been included in Section 5 and at the end of this Management Summary.

2.2.1 Phase 1 - Scope Area 1

Scope Area 1: To carry out an analysis of the relevant transaction logs for branches within the Scheme to confirm,
insofar as is possible, whether any bugs in the Horizon system are revealed by the dataset which caused discrepancies in
the accounting position for any of those branches.

We have performed testing of key inherent system controls, together with a review of some of the source code
which supports the correct operation of the system in relation to ‘bugs’ (an error, flaw, failure or fault in a system
that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways) which, it is alleged,
could have caused shortfalls in branch accounts. These are controls which in our scoping discussion with Post
Office and Fujitsu have been determined to be fundamental to protecting the integrity of transaction data within the
system.

The key controls identified were:

1. All transactions on the Horizon Counter balance to zero — No Relevant Exceptions Noted.

2. Transactions are atomically (either in entirety, or not at all) written to the Branch Database — No Relevant
Exceptions Noted.

3. Digital signature controls are applied to the Message Journal during initiation of transfer to Branch
Database, ensuring the integrity of data. - No Relevant Exceptions Noted.

4. Access to mechanisms for managing the digital signatures are segregated from database administration
responsibilities (via system access rights restrictions), meaning that even if such access rights be abused
the digital signature that is included with every Counter and Kiosk transaction could not be spoofed. —
Relevant Exceptions Noted.

The exception noted was (at the point our testing was conducted — June 2016):

- ‘25 IT users (i.e. non-Branch staff) have access to mechanisms for managing the digital signatures (i.e.
access to the key management server and related technologies) and have database administration
responsibilities and access. This raises the theoretical risk of a user ‘spoofing’ the digital signature. It is
understood that for this risk to be realised, due to time limitations and volume of work required in order
to successfully ‘spoof’ the signature, a program would have to be written (see section 2.2.10)’

5. Transaction Acceptance (in relation to interface file receipt for non-Counter originated interface files) is
required by Postmaster’s in order to be accepted into branch accounting records. — No Relevant
Exceptions Noted.

6. Recovery processes are in place for transactions in the event of connectivity failure. - Relevant
Exceptions Noted.

The exceptions noted were (at the point our testing was conducted):

- ‘For one of the transaction recovery scenarios tested (whereby a user session is automatically logged
out after a period of inactivity - 59 minutes after the session screen being locked), it was noted that
Post Office business rules (as would be enforced by the system) are in place for Horizon to
automatically commit unprocessed transactions to the Branch Database tables. This would have the
effect of committing any unprocessed transactions within a basket to the Branch Database. However
when next authenticating into Horizon, after being automatically logged out, the user is immediately
presented with a till receipt confirming that the transactions had been committed to the Branch
Database.’

POL00253246
POL00253246

The first exception could lead to an increased risk that Postmasters are unaware of transactions being
posted in a power failure, although they are notified by receipt that this has occurred.

The above controls were tested at a recent point in time, as they are system controls. Given this limitation the
following procedures were undertaken over change control, as changes to the system are subject to the change
control process in place over the Horizon system:

1. A review of sources of assurance around change control was performed and it was noted that three
ISAE3402 reports were performed covering the period April-December in 2012, 2013 and 2014 by
professional services firm Ernst & Young LLP. The scope of the report was seen to include ‘Fujitsu's
system of IT Infrastructure Services supporting Post Office's POLSAP and HNG-X applications’. Within
each reports’ scope was a control objective relating to change management, and in each report reviewed
no deviations were noted against this objective, or any related controls.

2. Further it was identified through change documentation review, and discussion with Fujitsu SMEs that
various controls tested had specifically changed, either since inception of HNG-X (replacing Riposte) in
2010, or changed during the lifespan of Riposte. Please see Appendix 5 for a full list of controls tested and
a view on whether the controls have been consistent.

In summary, the major change affecting the operation of controls in relation to this scope area is the creation of
the Branch Database (BRDB) to replace individual Branch Databases (2010). This change fundamentally altered
the operation of many controls tested. Whilst Fujitsu have attempted to give a view on controls in operation in the
Riposte system, much of the knowledge of this system has left the business.

Whilst not causing an exception to one of the controls covered by the scope of our work, the following exception
relating to General IT Controls over Horizon was noted:

- One Fujitsu user has access to both development and live environments of HNG-X, contravening typically
expected segregation between environments in a change control process (note: this is a separate point to
the segregation of duties issue).

As a result they would have the technical knowledge and access rights to make changes to Horizon HNG-
X which were not sanctioned by management — this ability could theoretically be used to subvert the
controls over Horizon, or system functionality, for personal gain or other malicious outcomes.

Fujitsu stated that:

“Whilst we appreciate that there is lack of segregation of duties here for the <specified user> between Live
and Development, it is felt that there is a strong business need for this access for <specified user>. He
provides 4th line/final line support for the audit service and is in regular weekly contact with the Security
audit team to assist them in resolving queries with the audit service. He is the lead designer/developer and
system owner.

Additionally there are compensating controls in place such as CCTV, and the auditing (performed by
Fujitsu) we have in place (and the technical controls around not being able to change audit items for 7
years) acts as a safeguard against anyone with access trying to change anything in an unauthorised way.”

In addition to the system controls noted above, the following analytics procedures were performed to support this
scope area:

1. Review of the case data available (relevant to allegations) for transactions indicating items of risk from a
system functionality perspective. The analytical procedures outlined in Appendix 6 were undertaken, and a
number of items of interest were originally noted (see Appendix 6a for details and summary of initial
findings). One such initial finding of note was that 'there were 48 (0.0015%) session ids from a total of
3,124,140 which were out of balance based on the transactional data received. Those 48 session ids out of
balance related to 18 distinct branches from 118 in total. The session ids out of balance were all pre
system migration to HNG-X in 2010. As explained in section 4.5.2 below, further sample testing work was
undertaken on the 48 items and it was established that none of the items originally noted were issues

POL00253246
POL00253246

when looking at fresh extracts of the system data — the original extracts provided were out of balance as
they had not been extracted correctly.

2.2.2 Phase 1 - Scope Area 2

Scope Area 2: To carry out a full review of the use of Balancing Transactions throughout the lifetime of the Horizon
system, insofar as is possible, to independently confirm from Horizon system records the number and circumstance of
their use.

In performing our procedures against this scope area, we worked with Post Office and Fujitsu to identify other
methods of posting transactions which could impact a branch accounts, without the knowledge of the Postmaster
which, in the context of the allegations, could present similar risks to that of Balancing Transactions. This
highlighted other areas of potential risk, such as:

1. ‘Global Users’ — being central users who can access branches remotely for support purposes (by remotely
this means accessing a branch terminal without being physically present in the branch). Critically we have
been informed by Fujitsu and have verified as far as possible, that such users are not able to post
transactions remotely (i.e. view only access), and they can only make edits when physically in the branch.

2. Database and Operating System Users with sufficient privileges to post transactions directly to the
database from outside of Horizon, thereby bypassing the system controls to manage activity.

These areas were brought into scope.

In summary across each of these areas, including Balancing Transactions, controls were noted to be operating
effectively. In particular, based on the procedures we have performed:

1. Logical Access rights to these sensitive functions had been appropriately restricted. - No Relevant
Exceptions Noted.

2. Any writes by the Shared Service Centre (SSC) to the BRDB must be audited. The mechanism for
inserting a correction record must ensure that the auditing of that action performed must be atomic. — No
Relevant Exceptions Noted.

3. Access to these mechanisms is segregated from key management responsibilities (via system access
rights restrictions), meaning that should such access rights be abused the digital signature that is included
with every Counter and Kiosk transaction could not be spoofed. — Relevant Exceptions Noted.

The exception noted (at the point our testing was conducted — June 2016) was:

- ‘25 users have access to mechanisms for managing the digital signatures and have database
administration responsibilities and access. This raises the theoretical risk of a user ‘spoofing’ the digital
signature. It is understood that for this risk to be realised, due to time limitations and volume of work
required in order to successfully ‘spoof’ the signature, a program would have to be written.’

4. It was also noted via a control walkthrough that any Transaction Corrections created by Post Office
Finance must be accepted by a Postmaster at branch prior to affecting branch accounts. — No Relevant
Exceptions Noted.

5. Inherent system controls around Global Users were tested, notably that Global users with a Role of ADMIN
cannot log onto any Branch other than Global (including Remote access controls to branch infrastructure
(e.g. Counter)). — No Relevant Exceptions Noted.

6. SSC will have privileges of only inserting balancing / correcting transactions to relevant tables in the
database. SSC will not have any privileges to update or delete records in the database. — Relevant
exception noted.

The exception noted was:

‘This number, 26, is different to the previous figure of 25 quoted around privileged users with access to both

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential — Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 15
POL00253246
POL00253246

- ‘The control wording is not accurate. 26’ users (at the time of testing — May 2016) are granted
extended privileges which enable them to update / delete records. However the control is operating in
line with management's expectations. Access to the privileged role is restricted to users explicitly
authorised for this access. User actions are audit logged, but not proactively reviewed.’ (Note: This has
been raised as an exception as it is stating that 26 users within SSC also have backend database
access allowing them to directly insert transactions).

The above controls were tested at a recent point in time, as they are system controls. Given the limitations around
this, the following procedures were undertaken over change control, as changes to the system are subject to the
change control process in place over the Horizon system:

1. A review of sources of assurance around change control was performed and it was noted that three
ISAE3402 reports were performed covering the period April-December in 2012, 2013 and 2014 by
professional services firm Ernst & Young. The scope of the report was seen to include ‘Fujitsu's system of
IT Infrastructure Services supporting Post Office's POLSAP and HNG-X applications’. Within each reports
scope was a control objective relating to change management, and in each report reviewed no deviations
were noted against this objective, or any related controls.

2. Further, it was identified through change documentation review and discussion with Fujitsu SMEs that
various controls tested had specifically changed, either since inception of HNG-X (replacing Riposte) in
2010, or changed during the lifespan of Riposte. Please see Appendix 5 for a full list of controls tested and
a view on whether the controls have been consistent.

In summary, the major change affecting the operation of the controls tested is the creation of the BRDB to replace
individual Branch Databases (2010). This change fundamentally altered the operation of many of the controls
tested. It is not known whether balancing transactions existed in Riposte, as much of the knowledge of this system
has left the business.

An exception was noted relating to a core General IT Control exception around Segregation of Duties; please see
section 2.2.1 above where this issue is described in detail.

In addition to the system controls noted above, the following analytics procedures were performed to support this
scope area:

1. All available audit data over the use of Balancing Transactions was inspected (12/03/2010 — 28/05/2016)
and it was noted that only 1 ‘true’ Balancing Transaction was inserted, it did not relate to a branch involved
in the allegations, and the branch was made aware of the transaction prior to insertion. The insertion was
four new lines of transactions each for a value of £4000. Other uses of the tool used to insert Balancing
Transactions were noted, however they do not affect transactional data and relate to the update of a
specific flag (SU) to enable continued processing.

2. Additional context around the usage of this tool was obtained from ticket review:

a. The original TFS helpdesk ticket was obtained which is the legacy system used by Post Office
where branch incidents are recorded. The TFS ticket 2091569 was reviewed and it was noted that
this had been raised by Anthony Vasse (Service Desk) on 02/03/2010 and transferred to Cheryl
Card (SSC Product Specialist). Within the incident ticket it was noted that the after investigation
the clerk had incorrectly doubled a transfer of stock of £4000.00 to £8000.00; therefore creating an
incorrect loss to the branch of £4000.00. It was noted this issue was required to be fixed by
17/03/2010 as the branch was due to roll into the next transaction period; therefore meaning that
the branch required a fix to ensure the accounts were correctly recorded. An update was provided
by Cheryl Card on 11/03/2010 confirming that the issue had been resolved using the transaction
tool to insert transactions into the BRDB_RX_REP_SESSION and
BRDB_RX_EPOSS_TRANSACTIONS tables to reverse the incorrect £4000.00 charge. The ticket
confirmed that the Post Master had been advised to print a balance snapshot of the accounts
before and after the transaction correction took place to ensure the transaction had been reversed
correctly. A subsequent update was provided confirming that the balances had been correctly
fixed. The ticket was subsequently closed on 04/04/2010.

BRDB and the Key Management Server (thus contravening expected segregation of duties), as it relates purely to
SSC users with privileged access rights, contravening the above control wording.

POL00253246

b. Evidence was obtained of the Peak Incident ticket raised in relation to this balancing transaction
performed. Incident ticket ‘PC0195561' was raised by Lorraine Elliot (Service Desk) on 15/04/2010
in relation to a Post Master attempting to transfer £4000.00 when the system crashed resulting in
the post master being issued with 2 x £4000.00 receipts.

c. An OCP ticket was also raised which is the solution management system used by Fujitsu which
tracks issues and resolutions. From this OCP reference 25882 it could be seen that the branch
had performed a transfer out of stock for the value of £4000.00 but due to a system error this had
incorrectly doubled in value creating an imbalance of £4000. Therefore, a balancing transaction of
£4000.00 was required to correct the loss using the transaction correction tool. This was approved
by Emma Langfield (Post Office) on 10/03/2010 at 15:33. From this OCP ticket, it could be seen
that this incident was raised by Cheryl Card (SSC Product Specialist) on 10/03/2010 who
subsequently performed the work and inserted the balancing transaction.

2.2.3 Phase 1 - Scope Area 3

Scope Area 3: To carry out a full review of the controls over the user and capability of authorised Fujitsu personnel to
create, amend or delete baskets within a sealed Audit Store throughout the lifetime of the Horizon system, insofar as is
possible.

In performing our procedures against this scope area, we worked with Post Office and Fujitsu to identify how
baskets of transactions flow from creation at the counter, through the sealed Audit Store (See Section 3,
Background, for a high level overview).

[xia]
Further, we tested controls over the accuracy, completeness and validity of the flow of data into the Audit Store,

which is used as the master data source for audit purposes (and hence the primary source of data in relation to
these cases). We identified the following key controls during scoping as being fundamental to ensuring the

accuracy, completeness and validity of this data flow:

ihe

The flow of data from counter to Audit Store was mapped at a detailed level (See Section 1 for high level
overview). Security controls over data at rest (when held in an intermediate location), and completeness
and accuracy controls over data in transit (transfer of data from one holding location to another) including
exception monitoring were tested. - No Relevant Exceptions Noted.

Security controls over access to the audit servers, and Audit Store were tested, specifically that there are
separate roles and a clear segregation between audit server administration staff, who administer the
architecture, and Fujitsu service audit staff, who have access to retrieve data from the Audit Store via an
audit workstation. —- No Relevant Exceptions Noted.

Access to mechanisms for managing the digital signatures are segregated from database administration
responsibilities (via system access rights restrictions), meaning that even if such access rights be abused
the digital signature that is included with every Counter and Kiosk transaction could not be spoofed. —
Relevant Exceptions Noted.

The exception noted (at the time of testing — June 2016) was:

- ‘25 IT users have access to mechanisms for managing the digital signatures and have database
administration responsibilities and access. This raises the theoretical risk of a user ‘spoofing’ the digital
signature. It is understood that for this risk to be realised, due to time limitations and volume of work
required in order to successfully ‘spoof’ the signature, a program would have to be written.’

The ATS (Audit Track Scheduler) collects files for sealing and records a log of its activities to the ATD
(Audit Track Database). In sealing a file the seal is generated using a MDS hash algorithm. Once a file has
had a seal calculated the file is written to Centera and details are stored in the Audit Track Seal Database.
— No Relevant Exceptions Noted.

Audit tracks and seals are copied to the equivalent import area on the remote audit server as part of Audit
server overnight schedule. On arrival, the sealer on the remote audit server recalculates the seal value of
the imported audit track and compares it with the original value in the imported seal file. Assuming they
match, the file is then written to the remote Audit archive. If the seals do not match, the Audit track and
seal file are moved to a holding area and an event is raised. Manual investigation is necessary to
investigate the cause of the discrepancy (which could be indicative of tampering with the data in between
the two Audit servers). —- No Relevant Exceptions Noted.

Audit tracks that are gathered at one data centre are replicated to the Audit server at the remote data
centre. - No Relevant Exceptions Noted.

As Audit tracks are retrieved from the archive, their seals are checked (by re-application of the MDS
message digest function) to ensure that the source data has not been tampered with while it was stored in
the archive. The digital signature check is also applied at this point to ensure data integrity. - No Relevant
Exceptions Noted (reader should be mindful of the more general limitations of the MD5 algorithm as
highlighted within the executive summary).

8. The remote directories from which the Audit Server gathers Audit Tracks is configured so that only the
Audit Server (or an administrator who has been explicitly given permission) is able to delete files in the
directory. - No Relevant Exceptions Noted.

9. All users (including administrators) of the Audit Workstation and Audit Server log onto systems using two
factor authentication in conjunction with the HNG-X Active Directory system. Each user is uniquely
identifiable. - No Relevant Exceptions Noted.

10. The following operating system level events on the Audit Server are audited via the System Management
event monitoring facilities:

a. Log on/Log off (including unsuccessful log on attempts)

File Creation, Deletion and Modification (on selected files)

Modifications to system configuration (incl. software configuration and account details)

System start up and shut down

Change of user rights

gpaos

Relevant Exceptions Noted:

- ‘Review of the audit settings for the Audit Server noted that the audit policy change which relates to
change of user rights was set to log success events only, with failure not enabled.’ (i.e. a failed attempt
to update audit policy would not be reported on).

The above controls were tested at a recent point in time, as they are system controls. Given the limitations around
this the following procedures were undertaken over change control, as changes to the system are subject to the
change control process in place over the Horizon system:

1. A review of sources of assurance around change control was performed and it was noted that three
ISAE3402 reports were performed covering the period April-December in 2012, 2013 and 2014 by
professional services firm Ernst & Young. The scope of the report was seen to include ‘Fujitsu's system of
IT Infrastructure Services supporting Post Office's POLSAP and HNG-X applications’. Within each reports
scope was a control objective relating to change management, and in each report reviewed no deviations
were noted against this objective, or any related controls.

2. Further, it was identified through change documentation review and discussion with Fujitsu SMEs that
various controls tested had specifically changed, either since inception of HNG-X (replacing Riposte) in
2010, or changed during the lifespan of Riposte. Please see Appendix 5 for a full list of controls tested and
a view on whether the controls have been consistent.

3. In summary, it is understood controls relating to the audit server and store have been relatively consistent
throughout the lifetime of Riposte and Horizon. It should be noted that whilst Fujitsu have attempted to
give a view on controls in operation in the Riposte system, much of the knowledge of this system has left
the business.

An exception was noted relating to a core General IT Control exception around Segregation of Duties, please see
Section 2.2.1 above where this issue is described in detail.

In addition to the system controls noted above, the following procedures were performed to support this scope
area:

1. The process of Journal-Sequence-Numbering (each transaction is given a unique ID of 1 greater than the
previous transaction), whereby completeness checks are performed over these JSNs, is an optional
setting within the system (which assures the completeness of messages from the counter in the Audit
Store). Testing supported that this control has been enabled since 2010 and not turned off since inception
in 2010. This was determined via interrogation of the supporting log file settings.

2.2.4 Phase 2 - Scope Area 1

Scope Area 1: Investigation of Privileged User Audit Logs from Branch Database, the controls over them, and
corresponding data extract and interrogation options.

In performing our procedures against this scope area, we held a workshop with Post Office and Fujitsu in which the
approach was decided for future phases, and centred on a report produced by Fujitsu on how Privileged User
access is controlled by Fujitsu.

The key facts determined at this stage of the investigation (to be illuminated further by the production of the
Fujitsu report) were that:

1. Regardless of access rights to amend and delete audit logs, the digital signature controls should still allow
for the detection of data which had been modified, deleted or inserted subsequent to receipt from the
Counter (subject to the next point).

2. There are a limited number of users (25 at the time of testing - June 2016) who could theoretically, due to
a segregation of duties breach between database administration and the key management server, amend
the Message Log for one or more Counters in one or more branches and make the transaction/s amended,
look legitimate when it is retrieved from the Audit Store (through spoofing of the digital signature).

3. However to do this would require an existing systems administrator with a large amount of technical
fasspertise and systems knowledge, it would require a program to be installed onto the Horizon Online
system, and a release process would have to be bypassed in order for this to be installed maliciously (and
avoid file integrity checking controls operated by Fujitsu).

Given the above findings, Fujitsu were requested to prepare a paper outlining the steps a Privileged User would
need to take to subvert the digital signature controls, and this has been documented within our write up of Phase 4
(see below).

2.2.5 Phase 2 - Scope Area 2

Scope Area 2: Investigation of analytics test results 1: ‘Identify Gaps in Audit Logs Sequencing’, and 6: ‘Identify
branches which are out of balance based on transactional data available’.

We performed further investigations over certain analytics test results from Phase 1. Analytic 1 — ‘Identify gaps in
audit log sequencing’ and Analytic 6 ‘Identify branches which are out of balance based on transactional data
available (should not be possible based on inherent system controls)’. These further procedures highlighted in each
case that there was a reason for each of the results and they were not therefore indicative of a problem with the
operation of the Horizon system.

The original challenges highlighted were:

1. Analytic 1 —\n order to identify gaps in audit log sequencing, the transactions data was sorted into
ascending order on session id and txn id, and any gaps in the sequence at both the session and txn level
were identified. There were 212,372 (1.60%) gaps in audit log sequencing from a total of 13,666,238
transactions.

2. Analytic 6 - \n order to identify branches which were out of balance based on transactional data available
(which should not be possible based on inherent system controls), the transactions data was summarised
by branch (Group) and session id and those session ids that do not sum to zero were identified, and are
ordered by balance descending. The data used was filtered for transaction mode ‘SC’ only. There were 48
(0.0015%) session ids from a total of 3,124,140 which were out of balance based on the transactional data
received. Those 48 session ids out of balance related to 18 distinct branches from 118 in total. The
session ids out of balance were all pre system migration to HNG-X in 2010.

The results after responding to the challenges in the original analytic were:

1. Analytic 1 -The analytic logic was revised following discussion with Fujitsu and following this revision there
were no gaps in audit log sequencing.

2. Analytic 6 - There was a logic error in the production of the extracts originally provided by Fujitsu. A
sample of 15 items which were errored in the original data was investigated to confirm they were fixed
when looking at the revised data provided by Fujitsu and confirmed the root cause was issues with the
data extraction rather than the underlying data within the system.

Given the original discrepancies in these analytics were resolved, no further work against this area was
recommended or required.

Phase 2 - Scope Area 3

[ Scope Area 3: Investigation of controls over the integrity of non-Counter initiated transactions, e.g. Paystation.

Following our work for Phase 1, we understood that non-Counter transactions were not subject to the same level of
controls as counter transactions for the following three non-Counter sources:

1. Camelot (Current)
2. Paystation (Current)
3. Post and Go (Historic)

A key area of focus in the operation of these controls is the ability of the Postmaster to validate that the data being
received from these external data sources is correct, and this was incorporated within the procedures that we
suggested for inclusion and testing in Phase 3. In addition, a diagram highlighting the understanding gained of the

data flows, and the related controls understood from technical documentation has been included within Appendix
8.

POL00253246

2.2.6 Phase 3 - Question 1

Question 1: Are there any gaps in the controls around non-Counter transactions that could call into question the
integrity of the data generated in relation to these transactions?

This piece of work investigated any risk of data relating to non-Counter {hsactions not being complete / accurate
and being at risk of interference. It can be split into two parts:-

1. the controls applicable to data in respect of non-Counter transactions before it is accepted into Horizon by
branch staff; and

2. the controls applicable to data in respect of non-Counter transactions after it is accepted into Horizon by
branch staff.

Our procedures centred on:-

1. understanding data flows and controls over the current reconciliation process and how Transaction
Acknowledgements are utilised;

2. testing key reconciliation controls between key data sources within the data flow;

3. performing detailed walkthroughs of the Transaction Acceptance process to confirm the granularity of the
information Postmasters are provided with; and

4. performing an analytics pilot to assess the feasibility of performing a reconciliation between raw data files
received by PODG (Post Office Data Gateway — the interface hub utilised by Post Office for receipt of
external data files from Third Parties).

The first key area of interest from a controls perspective in relation to the completeness and accuracy of the flow
of data is around the sending, processing by, and subsequent receipt of data from third parties. The primary
control in relation to this is the requirement for Postmasters to accept ‘Transaction Acknowledgements’ in relation
to such data before it is accepted into their accounts, but the formalisation of the processes and controls ensuring
Postmasters reconcile their financial positions before accepting transactions has not been enforced. We have
reviewed supporting documentation, primarily from the Horizon Online Help, which Post Office has informed us is
available to branch staff which describe a number of reports which are available to assist Postmasters to reconcile
data received from third parties. We have not validated this.

Originally it was theorised there was a second key area of interest, being that no digital signature is applied to non-
Counter transactions, potentially opening up this category of transactions to greater risk of interference subsequent
to processing into the BRDB (as the digital signature is the primary control preventing downstream editing of
transactions once they have been processed by the Counter). However, further discussion with Fujitsu established
that when the BRDB receives non-Counter transaction data, it pushes it down to the counter for acceptance by the
Postmaster, at which point the Counter digitally signs the acknowledgement of the transaction and therefore in
theory a reconciliation between these digitally signed TAs and the raw data files received from the third parties
(which are interfaced into the Audit Store) should also be possible mitigating this risk. Note however that this
means the data is digitally signed only from the point it is accepted by the Postmasters and not prior to that point,
making visibility and reconciliation of the data back to source by the Postmaster at the point of acceptance even
more important.

2.2.7 Phase 3 - Question 2

Question 2: If there are gaps:
a) Could they be the cause of discrepancies in branch accounts (or could they mean that errors in Horizon would not
be revealed and those errors could then be the cause of discrepancies in branch accounts); and
b) What is the risk of those gaps (or resulting discrepancies) materialising?

In theory, if a third party incorrectly reflected the data they had received from a non-Counter system, and this
incorrect total was then downloaded into the Branch accounts, then in the absence of formal controls to reconcile
data transmitted to the third party, back to data received, this could cause discrepancies in the branch accounts.
However, Postmasters are able to challenge any transactions that they do not recognise / agree with through the
aforementioned Transaction Acknowledgement process.

Without a full investigation of the controls at the third parties, and any other mitigating controls which may exist, it
is difficult to quantify the risk exposure. However, the control which Post Office relies on to mitigate this risk is
Transaction Acknowledgements and, as noted above, Post Office has informed us that branches have access to
reports which assist with the reconciliation of data received from third parties (see 2.2.7).

2.2.8 Phase 4 - Question 1

[ Question 1: To perform a review of Fujitsu Report in conjunction with initial comments raised.

For this specific scope area our procedures centred on performing a review of the report produced by Fujitsu and
the initial comments raised by Womble Bond Dickinson.

In the context of the allegations, this was to:-

1. provide Post Office with an independent view of the Fujitsu report;
2. provide the expertise required to challenge it; and
3. identify the residual risks.

Following the review we provided an email which set out our views in line with the above. This was then
supplemented by the workshop and challenge described in the next section.

POL00253246

Phase 4 - Question 2

Question 2: Hold a workshop with appropriate Fujitsu resource to:
a) Answer any outstanding comments / questions on the report; and
6) Produce a detailed commentary on what steps would need to be taken to replace the message log, as per section
2.2 of the Fujitsu report.

For this specific scope area our procedures centred on holding a workshop with appropriate Fujitsu personnel in
order to answer specific questions on the Fujitsu report and address any outstanding comments. Further, we
provided a detailed commentary on next steps required to replace the message log as per section 2 of the Fujitsu
report (See Appendix 9).

Our review of the Fujitsu deliverable highlighted that Fujitsu have acknowledged (in drawing the conclusions
below, we have taken what Fujitsu have said on its merit) that:

1. There is a theoretical risk of Privileged Users making edits to the Branch Database without leaving an
audit trail, as Privileged Users can, in theory, delete the audit trail of any edits they may have made to the
Branch Database. Fujitsu have however also represented that audit trails cannot be ‘switched off; in their
entirety as this would ‘break’ the Horizon application i.e. any such attempt would be immediately
identifiable.

2. The audit trails have been limited to logon/logoff events prior to 2015. This limits the value of the audit
trail in trying to determine any misuse (or indeed legitimate use, of Privileged User accounts prior to this
date).

3. Based upon the above findings, the value of further work over Privileged Users is diminished due to the
lack of granularity of audit trail pre-2015, and the capability of users to only leave a trace audit trail (their
final delete action — as described in 1. above).

4. The Fujitsu report further highlighted that to take advantage of these deficiencies would require the use of
a program. See section 2.2.4 above for further details.

2.3 Fundamental Limitations and Assumptions

Any procedures performed during our work against each scope area are subject to a number of assumptions and
limitations.

2.3.1 Phase 0 and Phase 1

fhe

It should be noted that controls tested/to be tested for Phase 1 relating to the system were tested on the
system (HNG-X) operating at the time of our review, It must be noted that at the time of some allegations
the Legacy Horizon system was still in use. In performing our testing we have commented on the evidence
that supports the view that the control was operating in the relevant period where we were able to do so.
Further, all analytical procedures for Phase 1 were subject to the availability of data / evidence. A full
transactional audit log is available since October 2007. We have not interrogated this entire data set. Our
procedures have utilised data provided by Fujitsu extracted from this broader population. Also any controls
testing is subject to the availability of evidence.

Finally, our work performed for Phase 0 and Phase 1 are specifically limited to the three scope areas
outlined in the scope section above. Our work is focused on identifying, and performing procedures to
validate, the facts in relation to the Horizon system with regard to the three scope areas as above.

Please see Section 5 for a full list of assumptions and limitations.

2.3.2 Phase 2

ts

It should be noted that procedures performed for Phase 2 relating to the system were tested on the system
(HNG-X) operating at the time of our review. It must be noted that at the time of some allegations the
Legacy Horizon system was still in use. In performing our testing we have commented on the evidence
that supports the view that the control was operating in the relevant period where we were able to do so.
Non counter transactions work was dependent on technical documentation and our understanding was
based on these documents. Subsequent conversations with Fujitsu highlighted that in a number of cases
this documentation was out of date. Certain controls were originally scoped in for testing and then de-
scoped as a result of these discrepancies within the available technical documentation (see section 4.6.2
for details).

Further, all analytical procedures for Phase 2 were subject to the availability of data / evidence, and
reliance was placed on Fujitsu around the successful extraction of data. Procedures were performed to
support the completeness of the population of data provided by Fujitsu.

Finally, our work performed for Phase 2 was specifically limited to the scope areas outlined in the scope
section above.

Please see Section 5 for a full list of assumptions and limitations.

2.3.3 Phase 3

1.

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential — Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT

It should be noted that procedures performed for Phase 3 relating to the system were tested on the system
(HNG-X) operating at the time of our review. It must be noted that at the time of some allegations the
Legacy Horizon system was still in use. In performing our testing we have commented on the evidence
that supports the view that the control was operating in the relevant period where we were able to do so.
Further, all analytical procedures for Phase 3 were subject to the availability of data / evidence. A full
transactional audit log is available since October 2007. We have not interrogated this entire data set. Our
procedures have utilised data provided by Fujitsu extracted from this broader population. Also, any
controls testing is subject to the availability of evidence.

Our identification of non-Counter Transaction flows has been dependent on the availability of technical
documentation, and the accuracy of the facts and figures communicated within this technical
documentation.

Our testing of reporting available to Postmasters in branches was based upon testing at the Model Office
facility within Finsbury Dials, and we are therefore reliant on this being representative of the live
environment.
POL00253246
POL00253246

5. We have not been asked to validate or test controls at third parties such as Wincor, Ingenico and
Camelot, which would be a key component in managing the risks associated with completeness and
accuracy of the data flows associated with non-Counter transactions.

6. Finally, our work performed for Phase 3 is specifically limited to the scope areas outlined in the scope
section above.

2.1.4 Phase 4

1. Our work for this phase was based on a report produced by Fujitsu. We reviewed thaf seport and raised
questions on it which were answered, but we did not conduct any further testing on it.

2. Further, our work performed for Phase 4 is specifically limited to the scope areas outlined in the scope
section above.

3. Background

The Horizon system was developed by Fujitsu and is the core operational and Electronic Point of Sales (EPOS)
platform for the Post Office network. Whilst formal benchmarking data is not available, it is considered by
interviewed stakeholders to be one of the largest computer systems in existence in terms of the number of
transactions it processes on a daily basis, and it sits at the core of a complex systems estate with multiple
interfaces with other Post Office systems as well as third party systems.

The system has been in use for over 15 years and is audited by multiple parties for statutory audit, service auditor
reporting, and accreditation purposes. Given its size and scale, and the considerable intellectual property that
Fujitsu has built within the system, in relation to this piece of work, there is a significant quantity of documentation
articulating how the various modules and features comprising the system operate. Much of this documentation has
formed the focus of our review during Phase 0 and Phase 1 of the work.

In understanding Horizon it has been important to distinguish between features which are of relevance today, and
the time period to which that relevance applies. In particular we would highlight the migration between the system
commonly referred to as Legacy Horizon, and the online variant operated today, referred to as Horizon HNG-X.
The key difference between these two iterations of the platform is the way data is stored. In the Legacy version
data was replicated between the data centre and the branches (this system was called Riposte), whilst over the
course of 2010 a migration event occurred whereby the Riposte system was replaced by the Branch Database
model, the Branch Database being a data centre only database storing the transactional and accounting data for
the branches, with a Counter application held locally within the branch which connects to the Branch Database as
necessary. This change may have influenced the relevance of some of the controls in existence at the present
time and care must be taken to consider this when prioritising procedures.

The Branch Database (BRDB) is also key to understanding the flows of data to the Audit Store given that it acts as
a hub for all branch transactional and accounting records. The diagram below provides clarity on the high level
flow of data from transaction origination through to the Audit Store:

Indicative Data Flow Overview

Counter Front end of the system, located behind the ‘counter’ in
branches. Transactions are input here by the Postmaster.

SSK (Kiosk) Configured the same way as the Counter, but for Kiosk

BAL Transactions are bundled into ‘Baskets’ and sent from the
Counter / Kiosk to the BAL once they are complete. All
baskets must balance to 0 (Debit = Credit). Data is then
transferred from the BAL — BRDB in real time.

BRDB ‘The Branch Database is an Oracle database and sits at the
heart of the Horizon system. It receives transactions from
the BAL and also from other sources as illustrated.

This diagram shows most but not all of the data feeds associated with the Branch Database, but does show all of
the direct transactional feeds to the Branch Database. It demonstrates the convergence of the data flows at the
Branch database and the chain of subsequent data movements.

In considering these diverse data feeds a key concept is those which use a public key infrastructure (Counter) for
completeness and accuracy of the message journals to the Branch Database, versus those which use a
combination of interface controls (header and footer records) for completeness, combined with manual
interventions from Branch staff around the completeness of the associated data (being the data feeds external to
the Horizon infrastructure e.g. Paystation).

3 Scope and Approach

3.1 Scope of Work

3.1.1 Phase 1

POL00253246
POL00253246

We structured our work around the three scope areas Post Office asked us to review, as shown in the table below:

Scope Area #
1

Post Office Instruction

Post Office consider instructing a suitably qualified
party to carry out an analysis of the relevant
transaction logs for branches within the Scheme to
confirm, insofar as is possible, whether any bugs in
the Horizon system are revealed by the dataset which
caused discrepancies in the accounting position for
any of those branches.

Post Office instruct a suitably qualified party to carry
out a full review of the use of Balancing Transactions
throughout the lifetime of the Horizon system, insofar
as is possible, to independently confirm from Horizon
system records the number and circumstance of their
use.

Post Office instruct a suitably qualified party to carry
out a full review of the controls over the user and
capability of authorised Fujitsu personnel to create,
amend or delete baskets within a sealed Audit Store
throughout the lifetime of the Horizon system, insofar
as is possible.

Proposal

Post Office will instruct Deloitte to
determine whether such an
analysis/review is feasible, and if it
is, to provide an indication of the
cost, time and process that would
be incurred.

The approach to ‘Phase 2’ was to hold workshops with relevant stakeholders from Post Office to support the
delivery of the analysis described

3.1.3 Phase 3

This additional phase of work constituted ‘Phase 3’, the ‘Non-Counter Transactions Phase’, whereby Deloitte
performed agreed procedures in relation to non-Counter transactions to provide an assessment, as fully as
possible within the time allocated to this exercise, on the factors to consider, controls, and risks in answering the
following questions:

1. Are there any gaps in'thé controls around Non-Counter Transactions that could call into question the
integrity of the data generated in relation to these transactions?

2. If there are gaps:
a. Could they be the cause of discrepancies in branch accounts (or could they mean that errors in Horizon
would not be revealedyand those errors could then be the cause of discrepancies in branch accounts); and
b. What is the risk of those gaps (or resulting discrepancies) materialising?

We performed the following procedures:

1. Provisional workshop to corroborate understanding of data flows and validate the existence and
completeness of controls over the current reconciliation process, and how Transaction Acknowledgements
are utilised.

2. Review and test key reconciliation controls between key data sources within the data flow as highlighted
within separate table (Appendix 8).

3. Perform detail walkthrough of the Transaction Acceptance (TA) process to confirm the granularity of
information the Postmaster is provided with. Perform procedures to corroborate a TA is required for all
Non-Counter Transactions.

4. Analytics pilot to assess feasibility and then perform reconciliation between raw data files received by
PODG and the interpretation of these Non-Counter Transactions into the BRDB transaction files.

The approach to ‘Phase 3’ was to hold workshops and meetings with relevant stakeholders from Post Office and
Fujitsu to support the delivery of the analysis described above.

3.1.4 Phase 4
Deloitte performed procedures in relation to the Fujitsu Report ‘Database Security in Horizon Online’, specifically:

1. Deloitte review of Fujitsu Report in conjunction with initial comments raised.
2. Workshop with appropriate Fujitsu resource to:
a. Answer any outstanding comments / questions on the report.
b. Produce a detailed commentary on what steps would need to be taken to replace the message log, as

3.2. Summary of Approach and Work Performed

The work was performed in multiple phases. Phase 0 was ‘Discovery’ and Phase 1 was ‘Testing’ of the original
scope. Additional phases of work were commissioned and specific agreed procedures were performed to provide
clarity over the initial findings from Phase 1, against the three scope areas performed during that phase (Phases 2-

4).

3.2.1 Phase 0 - Discovery

This phase of work constituted ‘the ‘Discovery Phase’, whereby Deloitte performed initial enquiries and
investigations across the three scope areas to identify procedures which Post Office could undertake for each
scope area.

In performing work for Phase 0, Deloitte conducted the following procedures:

Reviewed relevant technical documentation as requested and provided by Fujitsu/Post Office during the
course of this engagement.

Held workshops with Post Office Finance staff in Chesterfield on 14th and 23rd March, and 18th April
2016.

Held workshop with Fujitsu staff in Bracknell on 14th April 2016.

Held workshop with Case Handlers in Chesterfield on 8th April 2016

The aim of these procedures was:

1.

To enhance Deloitte's previous understanding of the key concepts, processes, risks and controls
associated with the Horizon system, relevant to the:three scope areas highlighted above (see 3.1.1).
To identify the fundamental limitations and assumptions which will need to be made and considered by
management when deciding which procedures they wish to conduct during Phase 1 (see 1.5, 2.3 and
Section 5).

As a result of “1” and “2” above, the identification of possible procedures which could be adopted by
management in order to provide assurance over the potential risks posed in relation to the three scope
areas highlighted above (see 3.1.4). We identified three core procedure types which were then utilised
during Phase 1:

a. Analytics — Procedures using data tools to analyse large volumes of data for particular
characteristics of interest or the absence thereof. For example verification for a given set of case
data that the JSN sequence is complete.

b. Controls review/and testing — Verification through walkthrough, enquiry, and subsequent evidence
gathering that the controls relating to the Horizon system operate as expected or otherwise, to
support in mitigation of the associated theoretical risks. For example testing that the population of
Fujitsu users who can administer the Oracle DB estate underpinning Horizon directly is
appropriate.

c. Substantive procedures — Direct inspection of selected samples or information for confirmation of
its qualities or characteristics of note (Analytics is an example of ‘full population’ substantive
procedures). In this instance the main substantive procedures expected will be inspection of
source code to verify that the system functions as expected.

3.2.2 Phase 1 - Testing

Deloitte conducted the following procedures:

i.
2

Performed on-site review and visit to Fujitsu and tested controls between May 2016 and September 2016.
Reviewed case data provided by Post Office case handlers and tested for characteristics which could
illustrate the Horizon system has not operated as expected.

POL00253246
POL00253246

3. Reviewed relevant technical documentation as requested and provided by Fujitsu/Post Office during the

course of this engagement.

3.2.3 Phase 2 —- Further Investigations Phase

The objective of the further investigations phase was to obtain sufficient information and background on the
specific areas in response to findings in certain scope areas looked at in Phase 1, and report on the associated
findings from these procedures.

In performing work for Phase 2, Deloitte conducted the following procedures:

fe

Held workshops with Fujitsu personnel to investigate the controls over Privileged User Audit Logs from
Branch Database

Tested a sample of items from each analytic population, 1: ‘Identify Gaps in Audit Logs Sequencing’, and
6: ‘Identify branches which are out of balance based on transactional data available’

Held workshops with Fujitsu personnel to investigate controls over the integrity of non-Counter
transactions, e.g. Paystation

The aim of these procedures was to answer the following questions,posed by Post Office:

What exact information is logged by the Privileged User Audit Logs?

Would this logged information definitively reveal that:

a. A Privileged User had done something that could change a branch's accounts in the real-world; and

b. What that Privileged User had done (e.g..does it show the change in such a way that it could be
identified and either isolated or reversed out)?

If the Privileged User Audit Logs would not reveahall actions by Privileged Users that could affect branch

accounts, please describe (in detail) the types of ways that a Privileged User could amend a branch's

accounts in a way that would not leave behind a footprint of their activity?

What is the root cause of the gaps identified in analytics 1 and 6?

a. Are these root causes indicative of problemsjin Horizon / evidence of flaws in Horizon’s controls
around the core audit.process?

b. Would these issues causeidiscrepancies in the branch accounts?

Are there any gaps in the controls around Non-Counter Transactions that could call into question the
integrity of the data generated in relation to these transactions?

If there are gaps:

a. Could they be the cause of discrepancies in branch accounts (or could they mean that errors in
Horizon would not be revealed and those errors could then be the cause of discrepancies in branch
accounts); and

b. What is the risk of those gaps (or resulting discrepancies) materialising?

3.2.4 Phase 3 - Non-Counter Transactions

This additional phase of work constituted ‘Phase 3’, the ‘Non-Counter Transactions Phase’ whereby Deloitte
performed procedures agreed with Post Office in relation to Non-Counter Transactions to provide an assessment
as fully as possible in the time allotted by the exercise, on the factors to consider, controls and risks, in answering
the following questions:

The procedures performed were as follows:

1.

completeness of controls over the current reconciliation process and how Transaction Acknowledgements
are utilised.

Reviewed and tested key reconciliation controls between key data sources within the data flow as
highlighted within separate table.

Performed detailed walkthrough of the Transaction Acceptance (TA) process to confirm the granularity of
the information the Postmaster is provided with. Performed procedures to corroborate a TA is required for
all Non-Counter Transactions.

Performed analytics pilot to assess feasibility and then performed reconciliation between raw data files
received by PODG and the interpretation of these non-Counter transactions into the BRDB transaction
files.

Scope Area 1: To carry out an anal

insofar as is possible, whether any bugs in the Horizon system are Fevealed by the dataset which caused discrepancies in
the accounting position for any of those branches.

4.2.1 Work Performed, and Analysis Results

Our procedures centred on the workshops and documentation reviews highlighted in Section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. In
addition, specific to this scope area we reviewed the case. data which had been provided to us, and assessed the
feasibility of performing analytics.over the available case data in order to ascertain whether evidence of the
system not operating in accordance with expectations could be identified.

Our work highlighted a number of fundamental system controls designed to ensure the integrity of processing, and
correct functionality. Key principles/items identified include:

1. Ata holistic level, IT change control processes and procedures operate over the Horizon system, and the
related controls around testing, approval, and the overall software development lifecycle should provide
assurance over the correct operation of the system. The operational effectiveness of this control
framework has, since 2012 been assessed on a regular basis, via Service Auditor Reports (ISAE3402
produced by EY). Further sources of assurance is provided by regular ISO27001 certification and ongoing
audit and attestation regime, and ongoing IT focused Internal Audit and External Audit activity. Errors in
the system would be more likely in an environment with inadequate change control procedures, and the
level of comfort that can be gained over such controls provides a view on the inherent risk of such errors.

2. There are some fundamental inherent system controls, specifically designed to support correct processing
within the system. These include:

a. Journal Sequence Numbers (JSNs) are applied to each Counter transaction within the Horizon
system. These JSNs are generated using Public Key Encryption and are used by each piece of
Counter Hardware to ‘digitally sign’ a transaction. The digital signature is passed to all latter stages
of the infrastructure including the Audit Store (and beyond). This signing process provides two
critical control points over the data captured:

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential — Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 3
POL00253246
POL00253246

i. The completeness (‘density’) of the flow of transactions for a particular Branch, meaning that
completeness of the audit trail behind transactions can be ascertained.

ii. The validity and accuracy of the transactions as any changes to a transaction after the
application of the digital signature would invalidate the signature. The Audit Store extraction
routines check for this at the point of extraction.

b. Transaction Acknowledgements (TAs) — Whilst JSNs are a powerful inherent system control over
the correct origination and completeness of the Message Journals from the Counter, other feeds
to the Branch Database are not subject to this control. However as an alternative control
mechanism the interface files, which issue data to the Branch Database contain Header and
Footer records which allows Horizon to automatically check the completeness of data. In addition,
Branch staff accept these interface files into their Branch accounts via Transaction
Acknowledgements, meaning these staff are directly responsible for verification that the data
being received into the Branch Database via sources outside the Counter are valid and accurate.

c. Recovery Procedures — In acknowledging that the Horizon system is dependent upon connectivity
between a data centre, a branch, and various third parties, seven recovery processes have been
designed to combat instances when a loss of connection causes an error in the completion of
transaction processes. The recovery process used depends on the nature of the connectivity
issue. Recovery scripts designed by Post Office are an integral part of this process.

d. The commit of transactions to the Branch Database is all performed as one Oracle DB write
action, i.e. it is atomic in nature.

e. All transactions from the Counter are checked by Horizon to ensure they balance to zero (double
entry principle). If the Counter attempts to write a transaction which does not balance to zero, this
should be rejected via the Counter.

f. External file feeds (i.e. for data feeds not from the Counter or Kiosks) are received by the Branch
Database and into the database by Horizon before being sent to the Audit Store. Alongside this
data flow, the raw interface filesare also processed directly to the Audit Store.

3. Alongside the inherent system controls available for our review, we identified two tranches of data
analytics work that we performed to assess the»potential risk of system failure or ‘bugs’:

b. Using the caserdata_ provided (for all the branches with links to Postmasters for which this case
relates via Post Office’s file sharing platform ‘Huddle’) we performed specific profiling tests which
support the operation of these inherent controls or rule out the occurrence of particular risky
events (€.g.[non balancing session IDs] from within the relevant data set.

c. The BRSS (Branch Support Database) is a copy of the main Branch Database used by Fujitsu
staff for support purposes. This database contains the most recent six months’ worth of
transactional data (the Branch database itself contains only 5 days’ worth of unsummarised
transactions). Using tools already available via Fujitsu we were able to profile this data to look for
characteristics of potential risk (such as recovery situations, Balancing Transactions, transactions
posted by staff not related to a Branch etc).

Post Office Instruction
Carry out an analysis of the relevant
transaction logs for branches within the

whether any bugs in the Horizon system
are revealed by the dataset which
caused discrepancies in the accounting
position for any of those branches.

Procedures Performed
Identified relevant business processes and
areas of interest.

Review of existing technical documentation and
identification of key inherent system controls.

Workshops with Case Handlers (Post Office) in
order to understand how to interpret the case
data.

Workshops with Systems Architects (Fujitsu) in
order to understand how to interpret the case
data and technical documentation.

A walkthrough on-screen as to how the system
works.

What we have discovered
There are a set of inherent system controls within Horizon targeting the
completeness, accuracy and validity of the flow of data from Counter and
other in-branch data sources, onwards to Branch Database, and ultimately
the Audit Store.

Central to these controls is the digital signature applied to each message
journal of branch transactional data sent from Counter to Branch
Database and beyond.

Connectivity issues are managed via Recovery processes, and so issues
with loss of connectivity have been built into the design of the system
from the outset, in recognition this could be an area of potential data
corruption or loss.

A strategy for our analytic procedures was to profile the available case
data for characteristics of interest in relation to the correct operation of the
system.

Horizon is configured to automatically log the user out, ending a user session

logged out, the user is immediately presented with a till receipt confirming that
the transactions had been committed to the Branch Database. From review of
the printed receipt, an enhancement point was noted in that there is scope for
the till receipt to include further detail to the user, highlighting that an unattended

Support for the audit service and is in regular weekly contact with the Security
audit team to assist them in resolving queries with the audit service. He is the
lead designer/developer and system owner.

Additionally there are compensating controls in place such as CCTV, and the
auditing we have in place (and the technical controls around not being able to
change audit items for 7 years) acts as a safeguard against anyone with access
trying to change anything in an unauthorised way.”

Data

3. Review of the case data available (relevant to allegations) for transactions
indicating items of theoretical risk from a system functionality perspective.
The analytical procedures outlined in Appendix 6 were undertaken, and a
number of items of interest were noted, see Appendix 6a for details and
summary of findings. One finding of note is that ‘there were 48 (0.0015%)
session ids from a total of 3,124,140 which were out of balance based on
the transactional data received. Those 48 session ids out of balance
related to 18 distinct branches from 118 in total. The session ids out of
balance were all pre system migration to HNG-X in 2010.

The results after responding to the challenges in the original analytic were:

a) Analytic 1 -The analytic logic was revised following discussion with
Fujitsu and following this revision there were no gaps in audit log

looking at the revised data provided by Fujitsu and confirmed the root
cause was issues with the data extraction rather than the underlying

4.3 Phase 0 and 1 - Scope Area 2

Scope Area 2: Carry out a full review of the use of Balancing Transactions throughout the lifetime of the Horizon system,
insofar as is possible, to independently confirm from Horizon system records the number and circumstance of their use.

4.3.1 Work Performed, and Analysis Results

Our procedures centred on the workshops and documentation reviews highlighted in Section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2
above.

Balancing Transactions are exceptional processes used by Fujitsu support staff to correct exceptional errors in
system processing/fix issues or bugs in the recording of data. The inherent controls around the integrity of data
recording are designed to ensure that such issues manifest themselves in the data on an exceptionally rare basis,
and therefore volumes of Balancing Transactions should be inherently low (substantive procedures performed
support management representation there has been only 1 true Balancing Transaction since 2010).

Balancing Transactions should not be confused with Transaction Corrections which is a more routine process,
used to centrally correct issues by Post Office Finance staff, which are then subject to Transaction
Acknowledgement by Postmasters prior to being accepted into a branches accounts.

Fujitsu have advised that whilst there have been several hundred instances (circa 1,650) of Balancing
Transactions used throughout the known lifecycle of the HNG-X system, only one has been a complex usage of
the functionality, to correct a bug around double writing of a transaction, immediately subsequent to the migration
to Horizon HNG-X. The remainder relate to switching a flag on Stock Units (SU are a Counter concept to allocate
transactions to a particular ‘sub-branch’ area to enable users to process transactions on that stock unit (following
communications failure Stock Units occasionally become locked to editing).

Our work has highlighted a number of fundamental controls which are designed within the system to control the
use of Balancing Transactions and to ensure that the use of Balancing Transactions is recorded. Key
principles/items identified include:

1. Balancing Transactions are the only transactions that do not either originate at Branch, or have to be
acknowledged / accepted by branch. As such the use of Balancing Transactions is very rare.

2. Any writes by Fujitsu Support to BRDB must be audited (record created and stored in Audit Store). The
mechanism for inserting a correction record must ensure that the auditing of that action is atomic with the
insert of the record.

3. Fujitsu Support with access to post Balancing Transactions cannot amend the related audit files.

4. Fujitsu Support will have privileges of only inserting balancing / correcting transactions to relevant tables
in the database. They will not have any privileges to update or delete records in the database.

5. There are various inherent system controls around Balancing Transactions, notably that each Balancing
Transaction must only contain 1 transaction (single SQL statement) and the balancing transaction module
can only be run by limited appropriate personnel.

In assessing the risk posed by Balancing Transactions we have also enquired as to additional ‘privileged account’
transactions which could also be used to post transactions centrally without the knowledge of Branch staff. These
enquiries have highlighted two additional areas of consideration against this risk:

1. Global Users of the Horizon System — These are users that can log on at any HNG-X Branch, and are
used for a number of purposes including global user administration.

2. Other ‘Privileged Users’ - At various layers of the Horizon infrastructure there exist accounts with
privileged access rights which could be used to modify or insert data relevant to transactions at branches
should they not be adequately controlled. For example a Privileged User account on the Oracle DB
POL00253246
POL00253246

forming the nucleus of the Branch Database could insert transactions directly onto the backend (effectively
Balancing Transactions are a specialised ‘legitimised’ way of using such Oracle access).

A number of key controls were noted to operate on Horizon to mitigate these broader ‘Privileged User’ risks:

1. Global Users are subject to two fundamental controls reducing their risks. The first is that they cannot post
transactions in a branch unless they are physically present at that branch. The second is that the Global
Admins can only create users and there is therefore a Segregation of Duties between users who can
create users, and users who can post transactions.

2. Privileged User activity is monitored via log files which are transferred to the Audit Store following
aggregation by the Event Management System which collects log files from across the Horizon estate.
Regardless of this control, for transactions related to the Counter and Kiosks any attempt to insert
transactions into the database by an individual with the privileged access rights to do so, would be
identifiable due to the Digital Signature process applied to Message Journals from the Counter. To
circumvent this a ‘Privileged User’ would require the relevant access rights to the key management
infrastructure which controls the Digital Signature processes, and therefore the segregation of duties
between such infrastructure and the remaining Branch infrastructure is a key control.

Alongside the inherent system controls around balancing transactions, and the completeness and accuracy of the
audit log of Balancing Transactions available for our review, there are various data analytics procedures which can
be performed:

1. As discussed above Fujitsu highlighted that while the Balancing Transaction module has been used
several hundred times in the past 7.5 years, only 1 of these uses has been a ‘complex’ Balancing
Transaction. As described in our procedures below, analytical procedures were performed to validate the
number and nature of Balancing Transactions which have been performed in:

a. The Case Data available
b. The BRSS most recent 6 months data available
c. The full period of data available — (7.5 years)

Sample (or full population) testing could then be performed to validate that for all Balancing Transaction records
(except the 1 known Balancing Transaction, for which the branch was aware of) no transactional postings were
made using Balancing Transactions.

No issues noted

A direct observation of Fujitsu extracting Balancing Transactions was
performed and supported that the population of Balancing transactions
Fujitsu had originally extracted was correct. This direct interrogation of
the data supported that there had been only one ‘true’ usage of
Balancing Transactions for the available data period of HNG-X data
(12/03/2010 through to 28/05/2016 when the testing was carried out).
There were 1,644 Balancing Transactions utilised in total throughout
that period, but the others were all used to update the Recovery
Transactions flag in response to a known bug with the system where it
frequently gets set to the wrong value.

No issues noted. 1 Balancing Transaction identified (in the period where
data was available for review 12/03/2010 — 28/05/2016) which did not
relate to a branch involved in the allegations and was appropriately
approved and governed.

Additional context around the usage of this tool was obtained from
ticket review:

a. The original TFS helpdesk ticket was obtained which is the
legacy system used by Post office where branch incidents are
recorded. The TFS ticket 2091569 was reviewed and it was
noted that this had been raised by Anthony Vasse (Service
Desk) on 02/03/2010 and transferred to Cheryl Card (SSC.
Product Specialist). Within the incident ticket it was noted that
the after investigation the clerk had incorrectly doubled a
transfer of stock of £4000.00 to £8000.00; therefore creating an
incorrect loss to the branch of £4000.00. It was noted this issue

48
POL00253246
POL00253246

b. was required to be fixed by 17/03/2010 as the branch was due
to roll into the next transaction period; therefore meaning that
the branch required a fix to ensure the accounts were correctly
recorded. An update was provided by Chery! Card on
11/03/2010 confirming that the issue had been resolved using
the transaction tool to insert transactions into the
BRDB_RX_REP_SESSION and
BRDB_RX_EPOSS_TRANSACTIONS tables to reverse the
incorrect £4000.00 charge. The ticket confirmed that the Post
Master had been advised to print a balance snapshot of the
accounts before and after the transaction correction took place
to ensure the transaction had been reversed correctly. A
subsequent update was provided confirming that the balances
had been correctly fixed. The ticket was subsequently closed on
04/04/2010.

c. Evidence was obtained of the Peak Incident ticket raised in
relation to this balancing transaction performed. Incident ticket
‘PC0195561’ was raised by Lorraine Elliot (Service Desk) on
15/04/2010 in relation to a Post Master attempting to transfer
£4000.00 when the system crashed resulting in the post master
being issued with 2 x £4000.00 receipts.

d. An OCP ticket was also raised which is the solution
management system used by Fujitsu which tracks issues and
resolutions. From this OCP reference 25882 it could be seen
that the branch had performed a transfer out of stock for the
value of £4000.00 but due to a system error this had incorrectly
doubled in value creating an imbalance of £4000. Therefore, a
balancing transaction of £4000.00 was required to correct the
loss using the transaction correction tool. This was approved by
Emma Langfield (Post Office) on 10/03/2010 at 15:33. From
this OCP ticket, it could be seen that this incident was raised by
Cheryl Card (SSC Product Specialist) on 10/03/2010 who
subsequently performed the work and inserted the balancing
transaction.

4.4 Phase 0 and 1- Scope Area 3

Scope Area 3: Carry out a full review of the controls over the user and capability of authorised Fujitsu personnel to create]
amend or delete baskets within a sealed Audit Store throughout the lifetime of the Horizon system, insofar as is possible.

4.4.1 Work Performed, and Analysis Results
Our procedures centred on the workshops and documentation reviews highlighted in Section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2
above.

For this specific scope area our procedures focussed on understanding the specific controls and processes around
protecting the integrity of data from inception to Branch Database, and subsequently to the Audit Store. Our work
highlighted a number of core concepts relevant to understanding the related risks and controls during this data
flow:

In essence the data journey can be divided into a number of distinct phases:

1. Transaction initiation within either the Counter, Kiosk, or ‘third party interface source’, and subsequent
interface to the Branch Database.

2. Archival from the Branch Database to the Audit Server.

3. Sealing of Audit Tracks via MD5 Message Digest and Archive to the Audit Store itself (Now based on
Eternis technology).

4. Subsequent Retrieval of Tracks, validation via the ARQ (Audit Track Retrieval) process, and Investigator
validation on the received data.

5. Non-Branch Transaction Data Records of Relevance

A. Transaction Initiation within either the Counter, Kiosk or ‘third party interface source’

1. For Counter and SSK (Kiosk) initiated transaction data, the JSN remains a core element of control for the
Audit Store process as it validates the origination and completeness of data for a particular Counter and is
independent of the MD5 message digest elements.

2. Given the wealth of ‘data at rest’ (stored in a directory/database awaiting onward processing) and ‘data in
transit’, security controls over access to ‘data at rest’ and interface controls over monitoring completeness
and accuracy of ‘data in transit’ are both pertinent. However the JSN concept provides assurance
regardless given interruptions in the sequence, or mismatch between signature value and message
content, would highlight downstream risks of data corruption.

3. The other interfaces pertinent to our understanding have been represented by Fujitsu systems architects to
be:

5. For many of these interfaces the Post Office Data Gateway (PODG) provides the point of entry to Post
Office infrastructure.

B. Archival from the Branch Database to the Audit Server

1. Archival from the Branch Database of data take place to the Audit Server (which is the gateway to the
Audit Store infrastructure) in accordance to an automated routine which is central to the operation of the
Horizon system. If archival did not take place then very quickly the system would run out of available
capacity. Two intermediate directories are used to hold records prior to transfer to the Audit Server.

2. As referenced above both ‘data at rest’ and ‘data in transit’ controls are therefore relevant to this stage of
the process.

C. Sealing of Audit Tracks via MD5 Message Digest and Archive to the Audit Store itself

1. The Audit Track Gatherer (ATG) is a routine which is permanently scanning for new Audit files on the
upstream infrastructure (including the Branch Database) which are then copied to the Audit Server, sealed
by the Audit Track Sealer (ATS), using the MD5 message digest algorithm, copied to the Audit Store
Eternis architecture itself, and then purged from the Audit Server when copied across.

2. The Audit Server maintains a database of sealed files and their seal values, for later interrogation when
locating files, and validating their integrity has not been violated.

3. Therefore once again both ‘data at rest’ and ‘data in transit’ controls are relevant to this stage of the
process.

4. Once on the Eternis hardware which has now replaced the EMC Centera hardware solution, the data is
subject to a number of controls around access, deletion and amendment, all of which are designed to
maintain the integrity of the audit trail during storage. Both EMC Centera (historical solution) and Eternis
(current solution) are specialised hardware solutions for the storage of audit trail data intended to be used
forensically.

5. Previously there was a seven year limit to the retention of data in the Audit Store, after which it was
purged by the system in line with Retention schedules. Given recent history this policy has recently been
changed to indefinite retention of all Audit Store data. As a result all transactions should be available for
as long as the Audit Store continues to exist from 04/10/2007, and therefore a complete audit trail of all
transactions ever posted on Horizon HNG-X should exist (given the migration date).

D. Subsequent Retrieval of Tracks, validation via the Audit Track Retrieval (ARQ) process, and Investigator
validation on the received data itself

1. Extraction of the data from the Audit Store is via a defined process known as the ARQ process. A
specialised Audit Desktop estate is utilised to interrogate the Audit Server database, retrieve relevant
sealed files, process the data, and burn to CD (or email as a data file), whereby it is made available to
Post Office investigative staff.

2. There are a number of logical access controls operating over this process, including role based access
mechanisms, a strict ‘segregation of duties’ from Post Office staff and audit logs over the process.

3. Upon receipt of the data files Post Office investigators carry out a number of additional checks themselves
in order to validate the data integrity.

E. Non-Branch Transaction Data Records of Relevance

1. Alongside the Branch Database data flowing into the Audit Store there are a number of other relevant data
sources:

POL00253246

a. Interface files received from third party systems which are then processed into the Branch
database, are also sent directly to the Audit Store as raw files, allowing potential future
reconciliation between the two data sources.

b. The Event Management System captures System Audit Logs from across the Horizon estate, and
processes these to the Audit Store.

Given the above understanding of the process gained from our work to date, our approach to assurance against
this scope area is largely based upon controls assurance, in combination with some limited analytics procedures to

support completeness, security and integrity of the data throughout the relevant data flows.

What we have discovered
The Branch Database is a key point in the data journey at
which all Branch relevant data whether generated by the
Counter or by a third party data source external to Horizon will
interface to.

There are a number of intermediate points at which data is at
rest during the flow of data to the Audit Store, and
understanding the Security controls over such data will
support the integrity of data flowing into the Audit Store.

Regardless of the opportunity or otherwise for interception and
tampering of data pre its arrival in the Audit Store, for key
data originating from the Counter and the Kiosks, the digital
signatures should highlight any tampering with data prior to its
usage within the Cases.

The Case data provided can be reviewed with a view to re-
performing the key integrity checks performed by
investigators, over the completeness and accuracy of the
data.

The Audit Store controls should have remained relatively
constant over the period of allegations when considering those
relating to infrastructure downstream of the Branch Database.
This is due to the HNG-X project which has influenced a
number of other key control areas, leaving the Audit Store
architecture relatively untouched.

4.5 Phase 2

4.5.1 Work Performed, and Analysis Results

Our procedures centred on the workshops and documentation reviews highlighted in Section 3.1 above.

In particular the following procedures were central in each case to our understanding:
Scope Area 1 - Audit Logs for Privileged Users

1. Awork shop was conducted with Fujitsu in order to discuss Privileged Users, audit logs, and the controls
thereon.

Scope Area 2 - Analytic 1 and 6 Follow Up
1. Workshops were conducted with Fujitsu in order to determine the relevant root cause in each case.
2. Where necessary additional data was requested.

3. Analytics were re-run with revised logic and the issues found in the original analytic were found to have
been rectified by the changes made in each case.

Scope Area 3 — Non-Counter Initiated Transactions

1. Technical documentation was reviewed in order to determine the nature of non-Counter transaction
process flows, the related risks, and the responding controls for the three non-Counter transaction sources
(Camelot, Paystation, Post and Go).

2. Aworkshop was held with Fujitsu in order to validate this understanding.

3. Amemo was produced highlighting the proposed recommended procedures, which was then translated
into Phase 3b scope and approach.

Some basic findings were determined around the audit logs operating over
Privileged Users in order to support with these determinations:

a. Regardless of access rights to amend and delete audit logs, the}
digital signature controls should still allow for the detection of
data which had been modified, deleted or inserted subsequent
to receipt from the Counter.

b. There are a limited number of users who could theoretically,
due to a segregation of duties breach between database
administration and the key management server, amend the
Message Log for one or more Counters in one or more
branches and make the transaction/s amended, look legitimate
when it is retrieved from the Audit Store (through spoofing of
the digital signature).

c. However to do this would require an existing systems
administrator with a large amount of technical expertise and
systems knowledge, it would almost certainly require a programI
to be installed onto the Horizon online system, and a release
process would have to be bypassed in order for this to be
installed maliciously (and avoid file integrity checking controls
operated by Fujitsu).

4.6 Phase 3

Scope Area 1: Are there any haps in the controls around non-Counter initiated transactions that could call

into question the integrity of the data generated in relation to these transactions?

4.6.1 Work Performed, and Analysis Results

In commissioning this work Post Office asked for a Deloitte viewpoint on the below questions which we have
provided:

1.

Are there any gaps in the controls around non-Counter transactions that could call into question the
Integrity of the data generated in relation to these transactions?

The first potential area of interest from a controls perspective in relation to the completeness and accuracy
of the flow of data, is around the sending, processing by, and subsequent receipt of data from third parties.
The primary control in relation to this is the requirement for Postmasters to ‘Transaction Acknowledge’
such data before it is accepted into their accounts, but the formalisation of the processes and controls
ensuring Postmasters reconcile their financial position accepting transactions has not been enforced.
Reviews of the supporting documentation primarily from the Horizon Online Help references a number of
reports which are available to facilitate this and Post Office has represented that Postmasters can
reconcile data received from third parties.

Originally it was theorised there was a second key area of interest, being that no digital signature is
applied to non-Counter transactions, potentially opening up this category of transactions to greater risk of
interference subsequent to processing into the BRDB (as the digital signature control is the primary control
preventing this). However, further discussion with Fujitsu established that when the BRDB receives non-
Counter transaction data, it pushes it down to the counter for acceptance by the Postmaster, at which point
the Counter digitally signs the acknowledgement of the transaction and therefore in theory a reconciliation
between these digitally signed TAs and the raw data files received from the third parties (which are
interfaced into the Audit Store) should also be possible mitigating this risk.

If there are gaps:

a. Could they be the cause of discrepancies in branch accounts (or could they mean that errors in
Horizon would not be revealed and those errors could then be the cause of discrepancies in
branch accounts); and

Theoretically they could — if a third party incorrectly reflected the data they had received from a
non-Counter system, and this incorrect total was then downloaded into the Branch accounts, then
in the absence of formal controls to reconcile data transmitted to the third party, back to data
received, the branch could, theoretically, cause discrepancies in the branch accounts. The control
which Post Office relies on to mitigate this is the Transaction Acknowledgements.

b. What is the risk of those gaps (or resulting discrepancies) materialising?

Without a full investigation of the controls at the third parties, and any other mitigating controls
which may exist, it is difficult to quantify the risk of any exposure.

Procedures Findings

existence and completeness of controls over the current reconciliation process, and
how Transaction Acknowledgements are utilised As a result of the workshop the understanding that Deloitte had originally
obtained on the operation of the interfaces between the systems was validated
with a couple of amendments. The attached diagram (Appendix 8) displays the
finalised viewpoint in relation to the data flows.

As part of this review the decision to exclude ATMs from scope as non-CounterI
transactions was examined and it was highlighted by Fujitsu that all interactions)
between ATMs and the Counter/BRDB are by rekeying of the data — i.e. this is
not a system driven process. Therefore the original decision to exclude ATMs
from scope was adhered to.

Review and test key reconciliation controls between key data sources within the data Fujitsu discussion highlighted that one of the controls identified for potential

flow testing was only operated temporarily during the switch from Riposte to the
Branch Database, and as a result no control exists to test in the present day.
The remaining two controls are legitimate controls to test, as they are currently
worded, and one requires a wording tweak in order to test.

The below table captures the controls in scope, and the required updates to the
original control wording where required:

b. On Receipt of a TA the Postmaster must complete the
processing of it, before trading can continue.

c. If the Postmaster disputes the TA, then the TA ID should be
noted to dispute with the helpline after the TA is processed
(this could then trigger a further Transaction Correction).

2. Review of the Model Office counter for each of these transaction types, I

within the system to all Postmasters), confirmed that various reports on
the balances are available to allow reconciliation between the terminals

summary of the findings against each of the three transaction types
which have been represented by Fujitsu and Post Office to formulate

4.7 Phase 4

Scope Area 1: Deloitte review of Fujitsu Report in conjunction with initial comments raised.

4.7.1 Work Performed, and Analysis Results

For this specific scope area our procedures centred on reviewing the Fujitsu report in conjunction with the
comments raised, and providing commentary on residual question areas or concerns back to Post Office.

Subsequent to these procedures a workshop was held with Fujitsu staff, whereby residual questions and concerms
were dealt with.

These procedures confirmed that a Privileged User would, theoretically, be able to amend data in a manner where
it looked legitimate, and delete the audit trail of them carrying out such activity with minimal footprint. The
technical hurdles that would need to be overcome would be significant, and the user in question would likely
require access to a programme to do so. The Privileged User would then be required to locate the programme on
the correct hardware, and Fujitsu have pointed to the state monitoring software which should detect if unauthorised
programmes have been added to the relevant hardware, whilst recognising this is not a formal control.

jresponses (in italics)).
We have also produced section (c), which
includes, as requested recommendations on the Horizon Online
further work to be performed in relation to the

Fujitsu report. 1. Is the segregation of duties breach between database administration and the key management server, the only
way in which a weakness could be exploited to overwrite transactional information in a way where it cannot be
traced and looks legitimate to the system?

It is the only way known by Fujitsu staff. Fujitsu do however stress that there are numerous levels of security which
would make any way to break through very difficult.

2. Is 1am the following day stipulated as the date and time by which overwrite would need to be achieved by due
solely to the Audit Store, and if so are there other more timely data feeds which would highlight a discrepancy
between actual ‘transactional reality’ and what is recorded in the Audit Store or the BRDB?

lYes, 1am is when ‘harvesting’ of data from BRDB to the Audit Store happens (the job is scheduled to run at 1am, so
actual harvesting is likely to happen in the minutes after this time). Therefore the maximum time slot for manipulation
\would end at 1am.

In reality there are other interfaces which occur on a more frequent basis, (which would leave a footprint on another
\system / part of Horizon) however only certain products are involved in these interfaces (mainly transactions which settle
with clients, and are recorded in somebody else's system). Therefore any manipulation would have to avoid these

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential — Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 69
POL00253246
POL00253246

\specific products. This adds another layer of complexity, theoretically however these transactions in the session could
ibe replaced ‘correctly’ (like for like), and not leave a footprint if done before 1am.

3. For step 6 of the replacement routine, can you remind us the technical reasons for requiring access to the BAL
Private Key?

\The BAL private key signs messages which come from the counter. If you are going to create a fake counter key, you
ineed the correct BAL private key to make the digital signature look legitimate.

4. On step 9 on the Privileged User audit log — how long can this log be edited by the Privileged User? Same
1am window before transmission to the Audit Store? Also a reminder that it is the hardware protection rather
than the digital seal which is important on the Audit Store due to the usage of the cracked MDS algorithm for
sealing?

\It is a daily pull occurring at around 1am, therefore the window is as previously described.

5. On the point on editing the log, if I’m reading correctly it would always be possible to see the last action by the

Privileged User, even if they deleted all else?

described in section 2.2, the Privileged User would need Read access to the Key Store database which runs on the
\NPS and Read / Write access to the BRDB. Note that should the rogue application run on the BAL, then this isn’t
necessary as the BAL’s have access to the Key store based on the IP address.

You can always see the last action by a Privileged User, if a Privileged User deleted their actions, it would always leaveI
a footprint of the deletion of logs. They could theoretically remove what they have done, but they cannot remove that the;

jhave done something.
\Fujitsu note that turning off audit logs completely will ‘break’ the application.

(A ‘Delete’ record on the audit trail is likely to be highly unusual & easy to spot.

6. Could a Privileged User (theoretically) cover their tracks completely by removing log on / log off activity from
the audit log without leaving a trace? If not how feasibly is a comparison between all log on/ log off activities of
Super-Users’ and MSCs in order to detect un-authorised access?

\As above in answer to question 5, they would always leave a trace.

jt is noted that log on / log offs by Privileged Users on BRDB / BAL are likely to be very rare (limited to system upgrade:
land should always be approved by an MSC (record of the reason Super-User access is required and approval for this
jaccess).

7. Although the Database Audit tables are not regularly examined they were recently checked as part of an
external Audit of Horizon Online. — Could you provide further context on this audit? What was checked and
why?

\Fujitsu have confirmed that NCC Group conducted an audit of HNG-X security in 2014 and PCI DSS audits are
\conducted annually. Further detail on the coverage of these audits of the database audit tables has not been provided.

8. How often would the individuals who contravene access SoD between the NPS and BRDB tend to logon to the
NPS? Also does the point raised on not needing to logon with access to the BAL broaden this concern?

\Fujitsu advised they would not expect Privileged Users to log onto the NPS on a regular basis (limited to upgrades /
\changes etc).

9. For step 2, how big is the average message log associated with any log on session. (i.e. is a log on session
generally all day and therefore the message log will hold thousands of transactions?)

\Normally 2-3 hours if not all day. (Some quiet post offices it would be notably less)

A log on session likely to be hundreds / thousands of lines. (1 audit line for every customer been server plus few extras

POL00253246
POL00253246

for printing reports etc.)

However even if a session was a small number of lines, a program would still be required in order to effectively amend
transactions without leaving a footprint due to the complexity of re-creating the digital signature for 1 transaction /
locating a suitable transaction.

10. For step 4, are there any barriers to uploading this application onto Fujitsu systems (if this would be required).
Presumably this would be required due to the volume of work required?

There is a detailed release process which all releases should follow. However there are no preventative logical access
(controls preventing a user from releasing programmes outside of this process.

IHowever if someone tried to not follow this process then File Integrity monitoring is in place on BRDB & BAL. This
\checks if files appear on a platform and flags things which have changed, the security ops team then investigate.

11. On step 8, is there a formal control operated by Fujitsu which can be referenced which would provide evidence
for ‘any instance of slow running on the system would be investigated by the support teams’. If not can we
articulate how obvious this would be to evidence it would be picked up in BAU activity?

‘Fujitsu noted that if the system behaves poorly this would be very obvious to Fujitsu employees who monitor system
performance on an ongoing basis.

jposte

1. The Riposte product managed the Message Store and it did not allow any message to be updated or deleted. —I
Is there any further information available on this control?

\Each message also had an associated CRC, this was basically a checksum that was included to ensure that the
message had not become accidently corrupted. Note that this was not a cryptographically secure seal and it would be

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential — Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 72
POL00253246
POL00253246

possible for a sufficiently technically skilled person to alter a message and recalculate the CRC if they had access to
ithe message outside the message store. — i.e. the level of protection on Riposte was lower?

The message store was a specialised database designed so that all you could do was add messages on, not amend
imessages.

There is no known loophole by Fujitsu to amend transactions due to the nature of database.

\As soon as messages arrived centrally, they were copied into audit trail immediately.

2. The Digital Seal for the Riposte Audit Store remained the same as for Horizon Online — i.
hardware protection was applied the same as well?

MD5? And the

Yes

3. Due to the size of the Post Office Network, branches were split into 4 separate Clusters. Each Cluster included
4 Correspondence Servers (2 in each Data Centre), thus ensuring that there were normally 4 copies of the dataI
held in the Data Centres. — Does this mean you would need to duplicate corrupted data across 4 servers?

To inject rogue transactions theoretically a user would inject artificial messages into Riposte, as they could not amend
messages due to this replication.

4. In Detecting Changes to the Audit Trail the following is stated, however, if such data were injected at the
Correspondence Server, it would be clear that this had occurred since the Node Id associated with the
message would be that of the Correspondence Server at which the message had been injected and not a
normal Counter Node Id. This would be clearly visible in any audit extract. Could this not be spoofed?

IWould need to run application on the counter remotely to inject transactions from the counter.

very difficult but not impossible”.

(This was not a Fujitsu owned system, source code owned and managed by another third party. As Fujitsu did not own
jor manage the source code, changes to the source code of the system would have to be applied by the third party, this
ladds another step of complexity in running a rogue application).

\(b) Detailed commentary on what steps would need to be taken to replace the message log, as per section 2.2
of the Fujitsu report

In theory, a Privileged User, could amend the Message Log for one or more Counters in one or more branches. The
following describes what would be required to replace the Message Log for a single counter in a single branch. This
process could be repeated for multiple counters / branches if required.

1. To exploit this, the work would need to be completed before 1am the following day (since the Message Log is
extracted from BRDB at some point after 1am each night and the data is then sealed and held in the Audit
Server). As such there is a limited window of opportunity. A log on session can last up to all day for a counter
in a branch, and is essentially how long the counter machine is ‘logged into’ in any one sitting.

If a branch is still logged into a session, and performing transactions in that session whilst someone was
attempting to amend the transactions in the BRDB there are likely to be additional complications around
maintaining JSN continuity and order, and ensuring the digital signature for all transactions in the session are
valid and ‘match’.

2. The entire Message Log associated with a Log On Session that is to be corrupted would need to be replaced,
as a new Counter private key would need to be generated, and as such all messages would need to be signed
by this key.

This is because there is no known way to obtain the counter’s Private Key and so a new one would need
to be generated as described below.

3. The records being replaced would have to correspond on a one-to-one basis to the original records otherwise
there would be gaps or duplicates in the sequence of JSNs which would then be detected as part of the Audit
Retrieval process. There is an estimated 1 to 1 ratio between ‘records’ and transactions, as such there can be

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential — Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 74
POL00253246
POL00253246

4. hundreds of transactions in any one session; all of which would need to be re-signed. Amending or replacing
certain records relating to transactions which are involved in more regular interfaces from BRDB such as third
party systems would have to be specifically avoided (or replaced on a like for like basis — this is replacing the
transaction with a transaction which matches it exactly) otherwise they would trigger errors in other
reconciliations; this adds an additional layer of complexity to this process.

5. An application / programme would need to be run by a Privileged User in order to correctly construct the
revised Audit Records due to the high level of complexity involved in generating new private keys / digital
signatures, and the volumes of transactions these would be required for within the time limitations noted in
point #1.

There is a release process which would have to be bypassed in order to get an application /
programme onto the relevant systems. It is expected file integrity monitoring / checks would identify if
a user attempted to introduce a rogue application / programme onto the relevant systems.

6. This application would need to generate a Private / Public key pair similar to the one originally generated by
the counter. Called an “Attack Counter key” in the rest of the document.

7. The application would need to have access to the BAL’s Private Key. Since this is stored in the Key Store
which is an Oracle Database running on the NPS, then it is assumed that a Privileged User would be able to
read this value and make it available to the application. This would then enable the application to generate a
Log On Message Log message containing the fake Counter Public Key and to sign it using the genuine BAL
Private Key.

8. All subsequent messages for the session would then need to be amended as required and then re-signed usingI
the Attack Counter Private Key generated at step 5. An application would be needed to do this due to the high
complexity.

9. Having constructed all these false Message Log messages, the Privileged User would then need to delete all
the genuine messages from the Message Log in BRDB and replace them with the false messages on a one for
one basis.

POL00253246
POL00253246

10. Note that as stated earlier, corrupting the Message Log in this way has no impact whatsoever on the Branch
Accounts, since these never refer to the Message Log. The Branch Accounts are based on copies of some of
the data held in the Message Log being stored in “working tables” within the BRDB. Clearly any application that!
is capable of corrupting the Message Log in BRDB would also be capable of updating (i.e. corrupting) the data
used to calculate the Branch Accounts. Therefore the above steps, if followed, could theoretically amend the
Audit Store record without leaving a trace, however there would be no impact on branch accounts unless a
programme was also configured to make the same amendments to data used to calculate Branch Accounts in
order to impact on branch accounting. This adds another layer of complexity to this hypothetical and unlikely
scenario.

5.1 General Assumptions and Limitations
Our work has been subject to the following exclusions:
15 We have only verified and tested information and or assertions provided directly by Post Office or
directly or indirectly by third parties, where it is stated in the report;
R For scope areas across all Phases, only matters relating to Horizon Features? and Audit Store within
the Horizon processing environment have been considered during our workshops and discussions;
3. We have not provided a legal or any other opinion as to the completeness and accuracy of processing
of Horizon at any point throughout the work;
4. We have not had direct contact with any third parties other than named contacts that you have
provided to us (Appendix 1). These third parties have been limited to Fujitsu and Accenture;
5, We have not reviewed any contractual provisions in place between you and third parties;
6. Our review of technical documentation is limited to that provided to us by Post Office and Fujitsu and

as set out in Appendix 1. Our work was limited by gaps existing in the technical documentation
available, relating to both the granularity of information and the existence of the Horizon Features over
the entire timeline of operation of Horizon process documentation. The effect of which is that there are
gaps within what we are able to comment upon over this timeline;

7. We have not validated or commented on the quality of the Assurance Work’ supplied to us.

Our work was also based on the assumption that the documents provided and assertions made are a complete
and accurate representation of the Horizon design, and Audit Store process. We therefore cannot comment as to
whether other processes would need consideration in the context of the Matters.

We have performed work on control in place and operating at the time of the review, and not those operating at
the time of the allegations. Other evidence has been obtained, where available, to provide a view as to whether
the control was likely to have operated at the time of the allegations.

? “Horizon Features” is a term we have introduced to represent those features of the Horizon processing environment, including IT management and

business use controls, which provide that:
‘* Movements in Branch ledgers have the full ownership and visibility of Postmasters; and

* Audit trails kept by the system are complete and accurate.
5 Since its implementation in branches, Post Office has commissioned or has received a number of pieces of work relating to the Horizon processing
environment, to provide comfort over its integrity. This work, referred to in our report as the “Assurance Work’, provides documented assertions
relating to aspects of the design and operation of the Horizon processing environment. The Assurance Work includes IT project documents;
operational policies and procedures; internal and external investigations and reviews; independent audits; and emails confirming otherwise verbal
assertions.

Appendix 3a

Scope area 2 — Balancing Transactions Controls (Broader population)

Ref I Control Description
All inserts will be audited in the table BRDB_TXN_CORR_TOOL_JOURNAL.

B__ I The PL/SQL package PKG_BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION will be owned by Oracle user
“OPSS$SUPPORTTOOLUSER’.

Cc The PL/SQL package PKG_BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION will execute with the permissions of the
OPS$SUPPORTTOOLUSER account and can only insert rows into the transaction tables as controlled by
an entry in BRDB_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS. The account will not have update or delete privileges.

D Each of the transaction tables that are allowed to have balancing transactions inserted on them has an
associated template file. Each file contains a template of an INSERT statement for that table, in the
required format, and listing all of the columns on the table. Users should create their own transaction file
based upon the relevant template file, substituting the values they require into the SQL. Note that some
of the column values specified in the template should not be changed — these are annotated with
comments as appropriate.

= When execution is complete the file is then moved to directory ‘/app/brdb/trans/support/brdbx015/output’
and the log file is created in directory ‘/app/brdb/trans/support/brdbx015/log’. Log file will be named using
the following convention:

<transaction_file_name>_<CCYYMMDDHHMISS>.log

Access to these 2 directories is appropriately restricted.

F It is expected that only a small number of skilled staff will run this tool and that they will have detailed
guidance as to when and how to use the tool (For example by restriction of staff to
“OPS$SUPPORTTOOLUSER’).

G From the Unix command prompt, execute the following

./BRDBX015.sh MyTransactionFile.sq! 2001

where the first parameter is the transaction file name and the second parameter is the branch code where
the balancing transaction is going to be applied. Note that the branch code must exist in the database,
and must not be for a closed branch. If this is not the case, then an error message will be shown and the
run aborted.

H The correction tool places a number of constraints on the contents of the transaction file. These are
necessary in order to provide a defined baseline upon which it can base its operation. If any of the
constraints are violated then validation will detect it and abort the run with a meaningful error message.
The constraints are as follows:

« The transaction file must be less than 32K in size

e The transaction file must only contain Unix-style end of line markers (EOL), not DOS format end of
line markers (CR/EOL)

e The transaction file can only contain a single SQL statement. If more than one balancing transaction is
required then more than one transaction file must be created, each of which is executed with a separate
run of the tool

e If the transaction file contains an introductory comment, then it must be a ‘/* ...... */ style comment,
not a ‘-- ......’ style comment
« The closing ‘*/’ of the introductory comment must have a trailing space (i.e. ‘..... */‘)

« The run symbol at the end of the SQL must be a ‘;’ , not ‘/’, and must have a trailing space (i.e. ‘.....; ‘)
e The SQL must be a valid SQL statement according to the normal Oracle SQL parsing rules (e.g. valid

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential - Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 83
POL00253246
POL00253246

e syntax, objects accessible etc)

« The SQL must begin with ‘INSERT INTO OPS$BRDB.’ and be of the form ‘INSERT INTO .....
SELECT ..... FROM dual, (SELECT ..... FROM .... WHERE .....)’.

° The table name must be one of the tables named in the
BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION_ALLOWED_TABLES1 or
BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION_ALLOWED_TABLES2 configuration parameters

e All of the columns that exist on the table in question must be explicitly named. It is not necessary for
every listed column to be on a separate line, but this is advisable for readability.

e The values to be inserted must be provided by the ‘SELECT ... FROM dual ...’. Each value must be
on a separate line. Trailing comments are allowed, but must be a ‘~ ..... ’ style comment. Any such
comment must not include any commas. All columns must have values provided for them (even if that
value is NULL).

e Certain columns are common between a subset of the transaction tables. In some cases, these
columns should be set to the same value no matter what table is in use. With the exception of the bind
variables listed earlier, the value that the SQL will try to insert is under the control of the user (i.e. it is
determined by the value specified in the SQL). However, the tool can be configured to validate that the
value specified in the SQL matches that expected. In order to do this, set the
BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION_ENFORCED_VALUES configuration parameter to include the field and the
required value.

The parameter is populated as a comma-delimited list of name/value pairs, where the name is the name
of the column name, and the value is the value to be enforced. As released, this configuration parameter
is set to:
NODE_ID=99,APP_SERVER_NODE_NAME=999,BRANCH_USER=:bind_SSC_user,BRDB_INSTANCE
_NAME=:bind_instance_name

which, for example. ensures that if a ‘node_id’ column exists on the transaction table, it's value is
specified as 99. If there is no ‘node_id’ on the transaction table, then no value is enforced for that field.
Note that if the parameter does not exist, then no values are enforced in the SQL.

I The SQL statement being executed will be logged in the table BRDB_TXN_CORR_JOURNAL. The
format of the data to be written to the column JOURNAL_XML is:

“<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<Support_Insert>

<Unix_User>Unix User Name</Unix_User>

<Oracle_User>Oracle User Name</Oracle_User>

<Sql>SQL Statement</SqI>

</Support_Insert>”

where :

e Unix User Name is the Unix user name under which the user logged in

e Oracle User Name is Oracle user that is carrying out the actual insert i.e. SUPPORTTOOLUSER
e SQL Statement is the final (i.e. after substituting actual values for bind variables) SQL that is executed
to insert the balancing transaction

J As records are being written to the audit files, the process must optionally be able to monitor if the set of
Journal-Sequence-Numbers for a node in a Branch is dense. The check should only be performed when
the value of mandatory System-Parameter ‘JOURNAL_SEQ_DENSE_SET_CHECK_ENABLED is
“TRUE”. When a missing journal entry is encountered, a message should be written on standard output
along the lines of “...records between sequence numbers M and N are missing...”. Once the list of
auditable messages for a node is completed, an Operational exception should be raised to indicate the
count of missing sequence numbers. Duplicate records are not possible due to the primary key on this
table.

K Unix shell script BRDBX015.sh which is in the /app/brdb/trans/support/brdbx015 directory. It is
deliberately kept separate from the standard $BRDB_SH directory so that access to the script and the
associated components can be restricted to authorised users. The shell script calls the PL/SQL package

PKG_BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION.

L PL/SQL package PKG_BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION, which resides within the Branch Database and is
owned by Oracle user OPS$SUPPORTTOOLUSER. The PL/SQL package is the component that
validates, creates and audits the balancing transaction.

M If an Oracle node/instance failure occurs, the utility will fail with an error code of 99. For all other failures,
it will fail with an error code of 1 and log an operational exception in
BRDB_OPERATIONAL_EXCEPTIONS.

N The SQL in the transaction file is validated as follows. Any validation failures are displayed to standard
output and logged to the log file.

e Check that the file does not contain any carriage returns, indicating DOS format EOL markers

e Check that the SQL in the transaction file parses according to the standard Oracle rules (e.g. syntax,
privileges etc). This is done using the standard Oracle DBMS_SQL.PARSE procedure.

e Check that there is only a single SQL statement in the transaction file. Note that in most cases, this
will be detected by the previous parsing step. However, the fact that the parsing does this is not described
in the Oracle documentation, so it may be changed in future releases of Oracle. Therefore, this validation
provides security if the behaviour of the Oracle procedure is changed at a later date.

* Check that the SQL begins with ‘INSERT INTO OPS$BRDB.’

* Check that the table named in the SQL is one of the tables listed in the two
BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION_ALLOWED_TABLES<n> configuration parameters. Note that as long as the
privileges are set up correctly (i.e. OPS$SUPPORTTOOLUSER only has insert privileges on the allowed
tables), any attempt to insert a balancing transaction on a non-allowed table will cause the previous
parsing step to fail (because the user would not have the necessary privileges). Therefore, this validation
provides security in case the privileges are not correctly set up.

* Check that all the columns named in the SQL exist on the table, and that all the columns on the table
are named in the SQL

« Check that the values to be inserted are provided by a SELECT ... FROM dual, (SELECT ... FROM
... WHERE) i.e. not a VALUES

e Check that if any of the name/value pairs that are listed in the
BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION_ENFORCED_VALUES configuration parameter are present on the table,
they are set to the listed value.

[e} Balancing transaction audit files (BRDBCO033), unlike the files produced by BRDBC002, are not
compressed, but are still encrypted.

Appendix 4

Scope area 3 — Audit Store Controls Listing

Ref I Control Description

A Audit tracks that are gathered at one data centre are replicated to the Audit server at the remote data
centre. This replication process is managed by the Audit Track Sealer. As Audit tracks are secured to the
Audit archive, they are moved to an export area awaiting transfer to the remote campus. A second file,
containing the calculated seal value for the audit track is also stored in the export area.

B Audit tracks and seals are copied, using robocopy, to the equivalent import area on the remote audit server
as part of Audit server overnight schedule. On arrival, the sealer on the remote audit server recalculates
the seal value of the imported audit track and compares it with the original value in the imported seal file.
Assuming they match, the file is then written to the remote Audit archive. If the seals do not match, the
Audit track and seal file are moved to a holding area and an event is raised. Manual investigation is
necessary to investigate the cause of the discrepancy.

Cc There will be a single instance of the ATS that concurrently accepts files for sealing/seal checking from
ATG and ATR and notifies sealed files to the ATD and into the Sealer Database for subsequent use by the
Audit Track Extractor.

The ATS shall collect files for sealing via I-ATS-4 and shall write a log of its activities to the ATD via I-ATS-
2. In sealing a file the seal shall be generated using a secure hash algorithm, the MD5 algorithm has been
selected.

Once a file has had a seal calculated the file will be written to Centera and details will be stored in the Audit
Track Seal Database via I-ATS-5.

D Access to the Audit Track files for gathering shall be via Samba (for Unix systems) or NTFS (for Windows
systems). Access to the sub directory shall be limited to the application generating the Audit Track and the
Audit Track Gatherer. Audit track files should be written in write-append mode.

E All users (including administrators) of the Audit Workstation and Audit Server shall log onto systems using
two factor authentication in conjunction with the HNG-X Active Directory system. Each user shall be
uniquely identifiable.

F The remote directories from which the Audit Server gathers Audit Tracks will be configured so that only the
Audit Server (or an administrator who has been explicitly given permission) is able to delete files in the
directory.

G All Audit Server and Audit Workstation and Centera hardware shall be held in physically secure areas
where physical access to the systems is controlled.

H There shall be separate roles for:

. Audit Server (inc. Audit Workstation) Administration

. Fujitsu Services Audit Staff

The roles shall be mutually exclusive, i.e. no one individual shall be given access rights of more than one
role.

i The Fujitsu Services Audit Staff role shall not have any write, modify or delete access to the Audit Archive.
J The following integrity checks will be applied to the data

. Completeness of data — contiguous message sequence numbers

. Integrity of individual messages

° For Riposte data the message CRC should be checked

° For HNG-X data the message signature will be verified

Separate Riposte and HNG-X summaries of the results of the integrity checks are generated. They should
detail:

. Summary of the message sequence runs broken down by counter Id. This should include start and

end date/times and start and end message sequence numbers. Any gaps in the message sequence runs
must be highlighted.

. Summary of messages that have failed individual message integrity checks
Any failure of the data integrity checks will not prevent subsequent execution of the query. The audit
workstation user will be warned of the failure via the server process status notification mechanism.

K As Audit tracks are retrieved from the archive, they are seal checked (by re-application of the MDS
message digest function) to ensure that the source data has not been tampered with while it was stored in
the archive.

L Only authorised users may access the Audit workstation applications. Authorised users are required to log
on to the workstation using two factor authentication and the HNG-X Identity Management system. An
Active Directory group named AUDIT_USER will be created with the rights required to utilise the
workstation applications. Authorised users will be added to this group.

M All retrievals of audit data are performed using the Audit Extractor Client, and all such user actions are
themselves audited. It is not possible for users to access the archive by any other means.

N Audit workstations and Atalla NSPs are located in secure areas. Only authorised users are given physical
access to these areas.

e} All auditable messages logged during a calendar day will be made available to the audit system in
uncompressed form as a part of Branch Database batch overnight processing.

The message journal is implemented in the form of a single Oracle table named
BRDB_RX_MESSAGE_JOURNAL. Uniqueness is controlled at the level of a Branch counter using a dense
sequence known as the Journal-Sequence-Number

enforced for that field. Note
that if the parameter does

Case Data Analytics Overview

The below analytical procedures were performed on ‘Case Data’. 'Case data’ refers to transactional data provided by Post Office, which had been extracted by Fujitsu
from the Audit Store, and relates specifically to the branches involved in the ‘allegations’. The data extracted is in 1 month periods relating specifically to the period of the
allegations for each specific branch.

There was an error in the original analytic

duplicated transactions from the dataset but
was in actuality removing both the duplicates
and the original transactions from the data.

When the analytic was corrected for this it
was noted that there were no gaps in JSN
sequencing were identified based on the data
provided.

Analytic 2: Identify gaps in
transaction times during working
hours

In order to identify gaps in transaction times
during working hours, the transaction data
was ordered by branch, date and time.
Gaps that were significantly higher than the
average gaps in transaction times were
identified, only transactions with the same
date were compared. Transactions with a
stock unit of ATM, LOT, OOH or BUR were
excluded.

There were 49,320 (0.36%) gaps in
transaction times that were more than 20
times higher than the average transaction
gap of all stores with the same number of
positions from a total of 13,666,238
transactions

In less busy branches these could be
legitimate gaps.

Extensive further manual analysis
would be required to positively
conclude these findings are
indicative of issues which would
seem disproportionate.

Analytic 3 : Identify two user logon
events in sequence without the

expected logoff event in between,

In order to identify two user logon events in
sequence without the expected logoff event
in between, an indicator of a connectivity
issue the events data was ordered by date
and time and logon events (event code 12
or “EPOSSTransaction.Ti of Logon

seem disproportionate.

Analytic 4: Identify recovery
transactions

In order to identify recovery transactions the
eventDetailMsg column of the Events data
was searched for words like ‘successfully
recovered’ but not like 'No recovery
required."

There were 30 (0.00057%) recovery
transactions identified from a total of
5,289,369 transactions in the events data

This is a low volume and likely to be
indicative of expected system
functionality. Specific controls have
been tested over recovery
transactions, during our production of
this report.

Where legal counsel is aware that
part of the case may focus upon hard
reset of branch counter equipment
(e.g. by physical removal of network
connectivity), these transaction types
may support that this activity was
occurring.

Analytic 4a: Identify recovery
transactions that indicate a
connectivity issue

In order to identify connectivity issues of
none recovery transactions the
eventDetailMsg column of the Events data
was searched for words like ‘could not
recover’ and 'No recovery required.’

There were 258 ‘no recovery’ transactions
that indicate a connectivity issue from a total
of 5,289,369 transactions in the events data

This is a low volume and likely to be
indicative of expected system
functionality. Specific controls have
been tested over recovery
transactions.

Analytic 5: Identify zero valued
transactions

In order to Identify zero valued transactions,
all transactions with a sale value of 0, a
quantity not equal to zero and a mode of
either 1 or SC for ‘Serve Customer’ were
identified and a summary per item is
produced.

There were a total 1,344,773 (9.84%) zero
valued transactions with a quantity not equal
to zero from a total of 13,366,238. These
transactions were against a total of 432
products

The impact of a zero value
transaction is not likely to affect
branch accounts, unless a value
should have been present. Extensive
further manual analysis would be
required to positively conclude these
findings are indicative of issues
which would seem disproportionate.

Analytic 6: Identify branches which
are out of balance based on
transactional data available
(should not be possible based on
inherent system controls).

In order to identify branches which were out
of balance based on transactional data
available (which should not be possible
based on inherent system controls), the
transactions data was summarised by
branch (Group) and session id and those
session ids that do not sum to zero were
identified, and are ordered by balance
descending. The data used was filtered for

There were 48 (0.0015%) session ids from a
total of 3,124,140 which were out of balance
based on the transactional data received.
Those 48 session ids out of balance related
to 18 distinct branches from 118 in total. The
session ids out of balance were all pre
system migration to HNG-x in 2010.

None — following further work
performed.

119
POL00253246

POL00253246

transaction mode ‘SC’ only.

The root cause for the 48 transactions
appearing not to balance was determined as:

a. Some of the audit log
sequences were missing a
start time and hence were
not extracted properly.

b. Some of the audit log
sequences were missing a
SC (Serve Customer) record
and hence were not
extracted properly.

These issues were shown to have been
overcome by looking at the raw audit log
sequence data (as it was the extraction
logic performed by Fujitsu which was
causing records to be dropped).

It was confirmed through the walkthrough
with Fujitsu and through checking the 15
sampled files independently that there
were no session ids out of balance based
on the new transaction data provided and
it was concluded that the out of balance
session ids identified on the initial run
through were out of balance due to the 2
errors identified above in extracting the
data from the raw audit log sequence.

Analytic 7: Identify transactions
posted by non-branch users
without subsequent branch
acknowledgement.

In order to identify transactions posted by
non-branch users without subsequent
branch acknowledgement, any users whose
id did not take the usual format (6 digits - 1*
letter of forename followed by 1* and 2"
letters of surname and numeric 001) were
identified. A user id of *PS98 are Paystation
transactions and were ignored here, a user
id beginning with a * are identified as global

There were 19 (3.31%) users from a total of
574 users classified as non-branch users who
posted transactions

The specific transactions are listed
below in ‘Analytic 7 detail.’ Extensive
further manual analysis on the
population of transactions identified
would be required to draw
meaningful conclusions, as well as a
further understanding of the owners
of these 19 accounts. This would
seem disproportionate.

Appendix 7

Clarification questions

The below clarification questions and associated answers attempt to provide clarity on queries arising from the
content of this report.

Key questions

1. From the perspective of the Group Action, we are trying to understand:

a. Whether Fujitsu can edit or delete transactions recorded by branches in a way that could impact
on the branch's overall accounting position?

Yes — Transactions can be deleted at database layer (BRDB) by DBA’s.

Before Audit Store access locked down, transactions could be deleted at Audit Store level (and still
can be once a transaction has been in the Audit Store for 7 years), but this would not affect a
branch's overall accounting position unless there was a query that resulted in the extraction of
data. If data was extracted from the Audit Store and records had been tampered with or removed,
this would be flagged upon extraction by the process to report on data integrity, so it would be
transparent that the data has been edited. It should be noted the warning that the data integrity
check failed can be ignored by the operator.

b. How difficult it would be to do (a)?

Firstly, access to do (a) is restricted to appropriate personnel by Fujitsu. However, for users who
have DBA access on the BRDB, this could be done.

However the window of opportunity to do (a) in the BRDB is finite, if the edit/delete of the
transaction was not done before the data had been ‘collected’ by the Audit Server (typically every
15 minutes for some products with a maximum exposure in the order of 24 hours for others), then
this would not affect the record of data in the Audit Store. The Audit Store is the location where
data is retrieved from in the event of a dispute.

Any amendment to transactions after the BRDB, whilst potentially impacting the Audit Store record,
would not impact branch accounting, only the master record in the Audit Store. Further, if the
edit/delete of the transaction was performed prior to the data being ‘collected’ by the Audit Server,
whilst it would be reflected in the Audit Store data, upon retrieval of branch data from the Audit
Store, if a transaction had been removed, the ‘data density’ check would highlight a missing
transaction. If upon retrieval of branch data from the Audit Store a transaction had been amended,
the digital signature check would highlight an issue with the integrity of the data.

c. Whether (a) is possible without leaving a "footprint" that is visible to either (i) Postmaster or (ii)
Post Office / FJ.
POL00253246
POL00253246

i) Amendment / deletion of transactions would not be overtly notified to the Postmaster, however if
the amendment / deletion happened at the BRDB, this would affect the declarations made by
Postmasters (encouraged to do so on a daily basis) and also declarations are required to be done
in order to rollover into the next accounting period (typically 4-5 weeks). The monthly Branch
Trading Statement which a Postmaster must sign off on in order to roll into the next accounting
period would also be impacted by a change of this nature which would capture summarised totals
of transactional data, which could be reconciled by branch back to the granular transaction log
reports. All of the mentioned reports are mechanisms by which the Postmaster would be made
aware of any such changes.

Amendment / deletion of data in the audit server / store has no effect on branch accounting and
would only impact a branch (Postmaster be made aware) if data was retrieved from the Audit
Store. Further if upon retrieval of branch data from the Audit Store a transaction had been
removed, the ‘data density’ check would highlight a missing transaction. If upon retrieval of branch
data from the Audit Store a transaction had been amended, the digital signature check would
highlight an issue with the integrity of the data.

ii) Branch Database privileged Oracle user operations are audited by Oracle to the SYS.AUD$
table. This table is extracted into audit files every night by a batch job into a directory from which
the audit archiving system extracts the data. The audit data is currently stored for 10 years. This
table can be extracted from the Audit Store by Fujitsu.

Any amendment / deletion of data in the Audit Store would be visible to Fujitsu only when data is
retrieved. Upon retrieval of branch data from the Audit Store a transaction had been removed, the
‘data density’ check would highlight a missing transaction. If upon retrieval of branch data from the
Audit Store a transaction had been amended, the digital signature check would highlight an issue
with the integrity of the data.

As per the exception noted previously, there is a small theoretical risk of a user ‘spoofing’ the
digital signature, arising from a failure in SOD controls relating to the digital signature, thus there is
the theoretical risk transactions could be amended with no footprint left. However to do (a) without
leaving a footprint in the system would be a complex procedure, new ‘keys’ would need to be
generated for all messages in the session, which is a time consuming process, as such it is likely
a ‘programme’ would have to be written and performed in order to perform this.

d. Whether (a) has ever actually happened?

Audit logs of Privileged User access in the BRDB exist. Fujitsu have confirmed where amendment /
deletion of live database tables would be identifiable from this log.

Our work has not included obtaining logs for the relevant time period and performing analytics over
them to identify any instances where this has happened, and investigate if so. Such procedures
should be theoretically possible however.

2. The key points we need to understand are whether (i) Balancing Transactions and (ii) changes by
Privileged Users can effect branch accounts from the perspective of the Postmaster, in particular:

a. Are these changes visible to the Postmaster?

There is no system setting which would flag to the Postmaster when a change had been made by a
Privileged User.

POL00253246
POL00253246

The Transaction Log report gives the Postmaster a way of identifying Balancing Transactions, as
transactions that have been inserted can be identified as the associated user would be displayed as
“SUPPORTTOOLUSER99” (i.e. not a member of staff at the Branch)

b. Can these generate a shortfall in the branch accounts?

If used in a certain way, BTs or a Privileged User change could theoretically cause a shortfall in
branch accounts.

c. How would this impact on the making of daily cash declarations?

Daily cash declarations are a real time report generated by a branch (counter) which queries the
BRDB live database; therefore any balancing transaction inserted into the BRDB or change of
transactional BRDB data by a Privileged User, would automatically impact the daily cash rec
report (impact dependent on nature of BT / change).

d. How would this impact on "monthly" branch trading balances?

The monthly Branch Trading Statement, which a Postmaster must sign off on in order to roll into
the next accounting period would also be impacted by a change of this nature.

The monthly branch trading statement, reports on data live from the BRDB, and aggregated data
from the BRDB, therefore any balancing transaction inserted into the BRDB or change of
transactional BRDB data by a Super User, would automatically impact the daily cash rec report
(impact dependent on nature of BT / change).

As this report been through multiple instances, the following queries were raised by POL and their
advisors, they were deemed to be useful to the integrity / value of the report so have been left in.

[A2s]
1. Data flow overview:

a. Transfer of data from BAL to BRDB - Does this happen daily? If so when during the day? Is it
overnight?

BAL is a compilation of servers used for the transfer of data from Counter to BRDB, this
processing is done in a near real time manner. As such transfer of data from BAL to BRDB is
instantaneous once a basket is complete.

i. Given the daily polling of data from which source does the Counter pull data when the

Postmaster conducts an end of day cash declaration? (The above suggests the data must
be pulled from BAL as all other sources would not be up to date in real time?)

BRDB. A request from counter is raised (via the BAL) to BRDB using pre-defined SQL
scripts at the BRDB layer to generate this cash declaration report/process. When a cash
declaration is raised by a branch a message transfer is sent via the BAL which
communicates with the BRDB to query the live transaction tables using a pre-defined SQL
script

b. Transaction corrections generated by Post Office: Where does a Transaction Correction fit on this
diagram?

All other uses of the tool in this period updated the specific table
BRDB_RX_RECOVERY_TRANSACTIONS'’ (SU issue) and did not contain INSERT statements.

c. Will the branch be aware of the SU issue?

The Branch would not be notified of the tool being used for this purpose, however this process is
generally initiated by the branch when the branch is struggling to perform this task manually using
the counter.

d. Can the SU issue ever cause a discrepancy in the branch accounts?

The usage of the too! to update the transaction recovery table of an SU does not insert / remove /
amend transactions. So no.

5. BT audit files:

a. What do the "audit files" in relation to BTs track and show?

All usages of the tool used for inserting BTs. The logs show the actual SQL commands used to
insert the BT, and contain all fields updated and their respective values (quantities and product
ids). There are also user timestamps which identify the user who inserted the BT.

b. How far back do the audit files go?

The audit files commence at 12/03/2010

6. FJ access to conduct a BT

a. How many staff at FJ have permission to inject a BT?

31 (of these 31, 26 also have direct DBA access to the live BRDB database and therefore could
theoretically make changes to transaction tables as described in (10b) below.)

b. What is the process followed by FJ for using a BT?
The process followed by FuJ is:
An error is recognised by the branch and they raise a request/call to SSC.

A TFS/Peak Incident service desk tool is then used to record incidents raised by Post masters
(TFS has subsequently been retired and incidents all 1st and 2nd line branch incidents are now
recorded in Peak Incident Management).

This issue will then be investigated by SSC. If a BT is required then this is passed to Fujitsu for
further work and solution management.

If a BT is required this is recorded on the Peak Incident ticket.

Approvals are then sought by senior members of Post Office before this is executed which is
captured within the ticket request.

c. What operational controls are there around the use of BTs at FJ?
A branch would initiate the process described in (b) above for a BT to be executed.
Senior approvals are required by Post Office before this process can be completed.

Use of BT tool is audited and any transactions inserted would be recognised by branch through
transactional log reports.

The BT tool is restricted to a limited number of Fujitsu personnel who are independent to the Peak
incident process.

7. BT visibility
a. Would a BT show in the branch accounts from a Postmaster's perspective?

i. What report would a Postmaster need to run?

A Postmaster is not notified if a Balancing Transaction is inserted into the live transaction
tables.

There are various real time reports a Postmaster can run which would be affected by
something of this nature (notably the Transaction Log report, which is able to display
transactions that have been posted over the last 60 days.). Transactions in this report
would be identifiable by the user code “SUPPORTTOOLUSER99" (i.e. not a member of
Staff at the Branch).

Further any Balancing Transaction impacting a branch’s transactional data would impact
declarations made by Postmasters (encouraged to do so on a daily basis) and also
declarations are required to be done in order to rollover into the next accounting period
(typically 4-5 weeks). The monthly Branch Trading Statement which a Postmaster must
sign off on in order to roll into the next accounting period would also be impacted by a
change of this nature which would capture summarised totals of transactional data, which
could be reconciled by branch back to the granular transaction log reports. All of the
mentioned reports are mechanisms by which the Postmaster would be made aware of a
Balancing Transaction. The reporting functionality of counters was described by Fujitsu
and this understanding was corroborated by review of technical documentation, no
walkthroughs were performed of this process.

ii. How would it be identifiable from other transactions?

Transactions in the Transaction Log report would be identifiable by the user code
“SUPPORTTOOLUSER99’ (i.e. not a member of staff at the Branch).

b. Cana BT by back-dated (i.e. injected into the branch accounts at an historic date)?

Whether the Balancing Transaction would be successful or not is not known by Fujitsu as it has
never been attempted.

Fujitsu have stated ‘the answer has to be yes in the sense that if the fix involves inserting a record
with an associated date then the date would be chosen as part of the design to fix the problem.
The choice of date would have to be made carefully as transactions will only be harvested from
the Branch Database for processing by back-end systems if it meets the correct selection criteria —
hence the need to test any proposed fix. . The issue is simply that we would have to invent a
scenario from scratch and then check that out. I don’t see that such an exercise would add value
given that we have already carried out a walkthrough of the tool.’

c. Were BTs (or something similar) possible in Old Horizon?
Fujitsu have advised they have attempted to make contact to retired staff on the matter but are
unable to provide a definitive answer on processes in place pre HNG-X relating to Balancing

Transactions, only that the transaction correction tool used to inject BTs that has been used since
HNG-X implementation in 2010, was not used.

i. What controls were there around these?

Due to the response on the previous question from Fujitsu we cannot comment on these
controls.

ii. Were they logged?

Due to the response on the previous question from Fujitsu we cannot comment on these
controls.

8. Privileged Users

a. Can Privileged Users only access the BRDB or can they access other servers (i.e. audit server,
Audit Store)?

Privileged Users could theoretically access data at any other point in the flow of data from Counter
— Audit Store. This flow of data has been mapped by Deloitte and access rights at each point
tested.

i. In Deloitte's Board Briefing Paper dated 4 June 2014, on page 2, it notes: "It is possible for

Fujitsu staff with suitably authorised privileged access to delete data from the Audit Store."
Has this issues been addressed / will it be addressed?

Yes, once data is in the Audit Store it cannot be amended / deleted for 7 years, as
described in (1a) above.

ii. Would deleting data from the Audit Store have any effect on branch accounting?

No, unless data was retrieved from the Audit Store which would only happen in the case of
a query being raised / investigation. It would only impact usage of this historical data for
any purposes when subsequently extracted from the Audit Store.

All Postmaster reporting functionality is generated from the live BRDB transactional tables
(and tables which aggregate this data and store it for up to 60 days). Any amendment /
deletion of data in the Audit Store therefore has no effect on branch accounting and would
only impact a branch if data was retrieved from the Audit Store. Further if upon retrieval of
branch data from the Audit Store a transaction had been removed, the ‘data density’ check
would highlight a missing transaction. If upon retrieval of branch data from the Audit Store
a transaction had been amended, the digital signature check would highlight an issue with
the integrity of the data. As per the exception noted on page 3, there is a small theoretical
risk of a user ‘spoofing’ the digital signature, arising from a failure in SOD controls relating
to the digital signature.

b. If a Privileged User edits data in the BRDB, how might this affect the branch accounts from the
perspective of the Postmaster?

i. Where does the edited data flow to?

The edited data would remain in the BRDB transactional tables assuming that it was
entered in the correct logic.

The data in this table would then follow the normal data flow processes (i.e. BRDB > audit
server > Audit Store, BRDB > POLSAP, BRDB > Counter reporting etc.) if this transaction
had not already been picked up by the mechanisms which transfer transactional tables
downstream (e.g. Audit track gatherer which runs every 15 minutes.)

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential - Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 128
POL00253246
POL00253246

ii. Could the edited data cause a loss in a branch's accounts?

Yes, from a branch reporting perspective any change to data in the BRDB would affect the
real time reports ran on the counter, which are used for branch accounting, specifically the
monthly Branch Trading Statement which a Postmaster must sign off on in order to roll into
the next accounting period.

However if a branches data was retrieved from the Audit Store, any amendment to
transactional data would cause the ‘digital signature’ integrity check to fail, and Fujitsu
would be notified of this failure upon retrieval of the audit data. As per the exception noted
on page 3, there is a small theoretical risk of a user ‘spoofing’ the digital signature, arising
from a failure in SOD controls relating to the digital signature.

iii. Will the edited data be visible to the Postmaster?
A Postmaster is not specifically notified if a change had been made by a Privileged User.

Any changes to transactional data would impact declarations made by Postmasters
(encouraged to do so on a daily basis) and also declarations are required to be done in
order to rollover into the next accounting period (typically 4-5 weeks). The monthly Branch
Trading Statement which a Postmaster must sign off on in order to roll into the next
accounting period would also be impacted by a change of this nature which would capture
summarised totals of transactional data, which could be reconciled by branch back to the
granular transaction log reports. All of the mentioned reports are mechanisms by which
the Postmaster would be made aware of any such changes.

iv. Would the edited data be visible to Post Office / FJ?

Yes, as the data amendments would impact transactional records in the BRDB, and
subsequently this data would flow through to the Audit Store. Post Office / FJ would be
able to identify this through review of audit logs as described in 1C above.

4 C&ARV Processing of the files will commence when the last file is received. The last file is identified by ‘Y’ in the Last File Indicator field
in the File Trailer Record.
5 C&ARV Generic file receipt process (BRDBC038) will handle receipt of the different files that arrive at the external interface and will
perform registry of the files in the file audit trail and will move the files to the input directory and the audit directory.
6 C&AKV Any transactions that would have been incorporated in the Transaction Acknowledgement feed that are delivered in the

Paystation / Post&Go files will be automatically included in the Branch Accounts without being presented to the Postmaster for
acceptance. Transaction Acknowledgements for this transaction detail will be created at the same time for later acceptance by
the branches.

It also takes transactions that have previously been held aside due to the lack of Transaction Acknowledgement / Stock Unit
mapping or due to the SU being locked at the time of original posting and retries posting of these transactions.

7 c An automated Daemon process operates that starts to look for the arrival of the External Transaction files at hh:mm O'clock but
gives-up and alerts if not arrived by nnn minutes later. (This allows Horizon transactions to get processed if External Transaction
files are late). This process performs the necessary copy / rename and creates links to audit directory. Hh:mm will initially be
18:00 and nnn minutes will be 120 minutes.

8 C&A FILE PROCESSOR

+ If the file pre-processor returned with an error in the range of 102-105, then the table BRDB_FILE_ERRORS will have a row
added to it with an error value equal to the return value of the file pre-processor and the associated row in
BRDB_FILE_AUDIT_TRAILS will be updated to status ‘X’. No other error values are expected and, if they occur, the process will
abend and alert the Operations staff.

+ If the file pre-processor was successful, then the file validation and database upload process will be called and exit status
checked.

9 C&A FILE PRE-PROCESSOR
The pre-processor performs a number of operations including splitting the files according to parameters. In addition it validates:
* The first record is a header record

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential — Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 134

POL00253246

+ The last record is a trailer record

+ The number of sub-files in the file equals the count in the trailer record

+ The total value of sub-files (in the trailer) equals zero

If any of these validations fails, then the whole file will be rejected, a row will be inserted into BRDB_FILE_ERRORS and no
further processing is performed on the current file.

C&A

DATA LOADING & VALIDATION

This function is initiated by the File Processor. The 8 files generated in the previous process will be attached to Oracle as
external tables and the data therein will be validated and loaded into staging tables. It will validate data items such as product,
mode, branch etc. A log will be held for each file processed and each sub-file processed that will indicate the filename, status

(valid/not-valid), and history of the file processing. A separate error table will record each error type and error code encountered.

11

C&A

Ensure that the count and value of transactions equals the number recorded in the sub-file trailer and that the value of
transactions nets to zero otherwise record in BRDB_FILE_ERRORS with record type = STZ, Error Code = 108, Description =
“Sub-File Trailer totals incorrect”

12

C&A

Load the Transaction Data and Validate

At this point, the file structure has been validated and we now need to copy the data from the external files into the Branch
Database in preparation for Transaction Posting later-on in the schedule. During the copy process the data will be enriched with
missing attributes and validated against reference data held in the Branch Database.

During processing of each record, transaction-level validations will be performed and any errors found will be written to
BRDB_FILE_ERRORS with record type = OXZ and FAD Code and Business date = Sub-File details. The error code depicts the
type of error found.

15b

C&A

If there is an entry in the error file with error_code = 101, then the file is a duplicate. The previous file that was delivered of the
same name might have had errors recorded against it and, so as not to confuse matters, only the 101 error is returned in the
error file.

16

Completeness Check

A process will check the table BRDB_SUB_FILE_AUDIT to test whether data has been received from all external sources for
the current date. If it has not, then an alert will be raised that lists all External Transaction sources that have not provided data
so that relevant stakeholders can be notified.

18 c The final stage of External Transaction Posting is to copy the transactions for the current sub-file from the Staging/Holding
tables into the Branch Database Receipt tables ready for onward delivery to the TPS and the APS subsystems.

19 A&vV A validation process will be followed that validates the content and format of data and records errors against bad rows.

20 C&A Transfer of data to TPS & APS...
Reconciliation totals are generated to ensure that the data that is sent to TPS and APS matches with the totals of data within
BRDB.

21 A&V Rejected and Held-up Transactions Report
A report is produced which highlights any transactions that have been loaded into BRDB but withheld from processing due to
lack of Transaction Acknowledgement mapping or due to the associated stock units being locked. The report will also list those
Sub-Files that have been rejected and have not yet been re-delivered error-free. This report will execute in the
BRDB_EXT_REP schedule.

24 C&ARV External data imported into Branch Database is copied across into BRDB_REP_SESSION_DATA. This ensures that they are
picked up for any Branch reports and Branch accounting.

25 A&V In order to post the transactions to the branch accounts, two criteria need to be met:
+ A mapping of External System and Terminal Id for all transactions must exist in the Transaction Acknowledgement/SU
mapping table
* The stock unit for the branch must not be locked

26 c A report will be produced that lists any sub-files that have been held-back from processing for more than one day.

27 A&V Camelot ONLY:
Retailer data is required to validate that the Retailer Number is a valid. Validation includes a check that the Retailer Number
maps to the correct valid FAD Code.

28 A&V POLSAP Load process: The Post Office SAP load process in XI has some explicit checks (introduced to prevent files being
accidentally loaded more than once) that there will not be multiple sub-files with the same Branch / Trading Date combination.

29 A&V Validation should be performed such that when loading the data from external files it is checked that the Product can be

32 TPS Processing monitoring

A monitor job tests for successful completion of the TPSTIPL schedule at 03:00 and alert operations if not.

34 Vv PODG will be used to transfer data between the Fujitsu data centre and External Transaction Suppliers. For External
Transaction interface files, there needs to be an inbound route to the Branch Database and also there needs to be an outbound
route from the Branch Database to Suppliers for the retum of Error/confirmation files. Logical access rights to these holding
directories are appropriately secured.

35 Vv PODG to APS Interface

Old process:
APS already has links to EDG1 and EDG2 for the delivery of AP Client Files. Access to these directories is appropriately
secured.

New process:
APS configuration has been updated to deliver client files to revised directories that will be shared with PODG. Access to these
directories is appropriately secured.

36 A&V Post & Go: Post Office ETL will validate incoming files in terms of shape, structure and check totals.

37 Post & Go:
The Transaction Detail record will always contain a core of mandatory fields, and the records will be rejected if these fields are
not populated.

An alert will be raised within Wincor Nixdorf in the event that the file transfer fails. The Post Office Live Service (Team) will be
A&V informed and procedures invoked to rectify the problem.

38 Post & Go:
If the file and sub-files contain no errors, Post Office ETL will rename both the copy file held on Post Office ETL and create an
error file with records type OKZ, to be sent back to Wincor Nixdorf to indicate the file is good.

A&V
When Wincor Nixdorf have investigated and corrected the records in error a new / corrected file it sends with the same name as

POL00253246
POL00253246

the error file, as Post Office ETL will know it has sent the errorfile and will expect the corrected error file to be replaced.

NB: If Post Office ETL receives a duplicate transmission file and / or sub-file(s), Post Office ETL will report this error to Wincor
Nixdorf, and will also send these back to Wincor Nixdorf.

39 Post & Go: Validation criteria for received Post and Go Files are as follows:
+ Post Office ETL to reject a file should any error be found within the file, sub-file, or records within the sub-file that Post Office
ETL cannot accept. In such a case, Post Office ETL will create an error file specifying the errors found
+ Post Office ETL will return the error file to EDG to be picked up by Wincor Nixdorf, specifying any rejected files that need to be
corrected and resubmitted
+ Wincor Nixdorf will return repaired error records in a new file (and sub-file) for repaired records
+ Post Office ETL must inform Wincor Nixdorf of an error within 24 hours. Wincor Nixdorf must keep the source files for 7

A&V calendar days in case Post Office ETL require a file to be re-sent.

42 A&V Paystation:
The Transaction Detail record will always contain a core of mandatory fields, and the records will be rejected if these fields are
not populated.

43 A&V Paystation:
When Post Office ETL has processed the file it will rename the file as shown in Table 2 indicating whether:
a. The incoming file from Ingenico has been received OK (suffix .TPB)
b. Any errors have been detected in the file (suffix .TPX) together with an error file (suffix .TPZ)

44 A&V Paystation: Any files which are re-sent are to be given the same File Name and File Header information, with the ‘Transmission
Status’ set to RES. RES is to be used for whole file rejections only.

47 A&V Paystation: For reversal transactions, the original Transaction Mode is shown in the transaction details that are sent to Post

Office ETL. Post Office ETL will know if a reversal has taken place by referring to the reversal indicator within the transaction
line.

Database Security in Horizon Online

Introduction

This note has been prepared by the Author to provide some clarity as to the veracity of some of the
concerms raised by Deloittes in its report to the Post Office regarding the Horizon system and
specifically Super User access. The purpose of this note is to explore the extent to which it is
technically possible for:

1. Post Office / Fujitsu to have the ability to log on remotely to a Horizon terminal in a branch
so to conduct transactions.

2. Post Office / Fujitsu to have the ability to conduct transactions (either remotely or locally)
under another user 's ID,

3. Post Office / Fujitsu to have the ability to push transactions into a branch's accounts
without either a postmaster's (a) knowledge or (b) consent.

4. Post Office / Fujitsu to have the ability to amend or delete transactions entered by branch
staff on Horizon (and can do so in a way that is hidden from postmasters).

In the previous reviews by Deloittes they have concluded there was a theoretical possibility that a
limited number of ‘Super Users’ had a level of access that would allow some of the actions I to 4
above, or their equivalents, to take place.

This paper shows the steps that a “Super User’ would have to make in order to alter the Horizon
Online Audit Trails. It also goes on to discuss, if such modifications were made, how they would
be detected. This is covered in Section 3.

Section 4 then considers the equivalent mechanisms in the old, Riposte based, Horizon system.
Finally, section 5 considers things from the Postmaster’s viewpoint.

This document assumes that readers have some familiarity with the technical documentation that
has been supplied to Deloitte to support their reviews.

Executive Summary

Fujitsu’s view and conclusion remains that whilst such unauthorised amendments by Super Users to
the Horizon Online Audit Trails are theoretically possible (as in all IT systems) they would be very
difficult and even if they were made, would almost certainly be detected as a result of the
discrepancies in the relevant logs and audit trails. In addition, it should not be forgotten that the
various Horizon systems provide records of transactions as opposed to access to the funds
themselves and as such, even if one were to satisfy oneself that this theoretical risk were real then it
is difficult to imagine how someone exploiting this approach would be able to benefit financially
without detection. It is our reasoned estimation that to carry out the complex and detailed technical
steps necessary to over-ride the systems check and balances and then to make artificially generated
funds disappear is not credible.

Horizon Online

Section I describes how the Horizon Audit Trail is generated and secured. Section 2 then explores
how, in theory, a portion of the Audit Trail could be deliberately replaced by a Super User. Finally,
section 3 discusses how such changes could be detected.

1. How the Horizon Online Message Log is Generated and Secured

The Horizon Online Message Log is primarily a log of all auditable messages sent from the
Horizon Counter to the Horizon Data Centre where they are processed by the Branch Access
Layer (BAL) which in turn updates the Branch Database (BRDB).

Note, that not all messages sent from the Counter are audited. However, any that could impact on the Branch
accounts should be audited. Each message sent from the Counter to the Data Centre indicates whether or not
it is to be audited (i.e. the decision is part of the counter application and not the BAL).

The BAL configuration also decides which messages pass through the Audit Filter (which does the auditing).

It is part of the system’s design to ensure that the counter and BAL configurations are consistent in this
respect.

Specifically, messages have jsns if and only if they are auditable and so the checks on jsn sequences described
below ensure the completeness of the audit trail.

Each Auditable message sent from the counter includes a “digital signature” generated using the
counter’s Private Key. This key is generated by the counter as part of the Log On process. The
corresponding Public Key is included in the Log On message sent from the counter to the BAL
allowing the BAL to confirm subsequent messages in the session come from the same counter.
Unlike other messages in the Message Log, the BAL adds a wrapper to this Log On message
which includes a further digital signature (of the entire message including the counter’s digital
signature and the counter’s Public Key) generated by the BAL, using the BAL Private Key which is
obtained from the NPS Key Store by the BAL at start-up.

All auditable messages are written to a single table within the BRDB known as the “Message Log”.
Each day (at some point after 1am) the previous day’s Message Log is written to a number of files
which are then passed to the Audit system which then “seals” each file and stores them until they
are retrieved (if they ever are) or deleted. Note that each file will include records from a number of
different Branches and there may be multiple files for a single day containing the records for a
specific Branch.

Deletion of Audit records is currently suspended. They should be deleted after 7 years, but deletion was
switched off sometime in 2014 (I think). Therefore, all audit records since Horizon Online went Live in 2010
should be available.

This seal is cryptographically generated and is based on the entire contents of the Audit File. Any
subsequent change to the contents would then invalidate the seal. The seal is held in a seals
database separate from the Audit Data. A feature of the Audit System is that data cannot be
amended or deleted until the pre-defined “Purge Date”. Super Users do not have access to the
Audit data.

All updates to the BRDB will be based on the information held in the auditable message and the
accounts (both as seen in the Branch and also as passed to Post Office Ltd’s back end accounting
systems) are based on this information (and not on the actual auditable message). This means that
in order to corrupt the Branch accounts, it is necessary to corrupt a number of different records
within the BRDB and not necessarily the Message Log. However, any evidence provided by Post
Office Ltd is based on the Message Log — hence the need to corrupt the Message Log as well.

It is asserted that by going back to the audited data (i.e. the Message Log) sent from the Counter
to the BRDB, then all Transactions that that counter carried out and their implications on the
Branch Accounts can be re-calculated and compared with the reports produced by Horizon based
on the other data held in the BRDB and Post Office Ltd’s back end systems. This would enable
any corruption of the data used to create the Branch reports to be detected from examination of the
Message Log.

When audit data from the Message Log is retrieved for whatever reason, a number of checks are
carried out to ensure the completeness and integrity of that data. These checks are:

e Each entire Audit File is checked to ensure that the digital seal stored at the time the Audit
was produced (i.e. the day after the transactions took place) is valid.

Normally a Data retrieval will be for a number of days and so a number of Audit files will need to be
retrieved.

e The data for the Branch in question is then filtered out from these audit files and checks are
then carried out on a counter by counter basis as described below for the period of the
extract:

o No part of the Message Log is missing or duplicated. Each auditable message sent
from the counter to the BAL incudes a unique sequence number (the Journal
Sequence Number or jsn). The audit records for any counter over a period of time
should have no missing or duplicate jsns. The standard Audit Extracts into Excel
include a report indicating that this check has been successfully carried out. This is a
sheet labelled ‘Summary’ in the standard ARQ report provided to Post Office Ltd.

o The message audited as part of the Log On process, is checked and the Digital
Signature generated by the BAL is checked by using the BAL’s Public Key (which
is known to the Audit System). This shows that this message was signed by an
application which had access to the BAL’s Private Key. This then provides access
to the Counter’s Public Key for that Log On Session (as this is included by the
message audited by the BAL and was signed by the BAL’s private key).

o All subsequent messages sent from the counter to the BAL during that Log On
Session are then checked to ensure that their Digital Signatures are correct (using
the Counter’s Public Key obtained from the Log On message)

2. Replacing the Message Log

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential - Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 141
POL00253246
POL00253246

In theory, a Super User, could amend the Message Log for one or more Counters in one or more
Branches. The following describes what would be required to replace the Message Log for a
single counter in a single branch. This process could be repeated for multiple counters / branches if
required.

1. The work would need to be completed before lam the following day (since the Message
Log is extracted from BRDB at some point after lam each night and the data is then sealed
and held in the Audit Server

2. The entire Message Log associated with a Log On Session that is to be corrupted would
need to be replaced

This is because it is not possible to obtain the counter’s Private Key and so a new one would need to be
generated as described below.

3. The records being replaced would have to be in one-to-one correspondence to the original
records otherwise there would be gaps or duplicates in the sequence of jsns which would
then be detected as part of the Audit Retrieval process.

4. An application would need to be run by the Super Users in order to correctly construct the
revised Audit Records

5. This application would need to generate a Private / Public key pair similar to the one
originally generated by the counter. Called an “Attack Counter key” in the rest of the
document

6. The application would need to have access to the BAL’s Private Key. Since this is stored
in the Key Store which is an Oracle Database running on the NPS, then it is assumed that a
Super User would be able to read this value and make it available to the application. This
would then enable the application to generate a Log On Message Log message containing
the fake Counter Public Key and to sign it using the genuine BAL Private Key.

7. All subsequent messages for the session would then need to be amended as required and
then re-signed using the Attack Counter Private Key generated at step 5.

8. Having constructed all these false Message Log messages, then the Super User would need
to delete all the genuine messages from the Message Log in BRDB and replace them with
the false messages on a one for one basis.

Or this could be done just by updating the rows with the new data.

Note that the table in the database is set to allow ‘append’ access only and has been designed to be appended
to at all times. The Super User would need to amend the access rights to the table before records could be
amended or deleted, and this would change the performance characteristics of Oracle; this alone may be
sufficient to make such an attack detectable as any instance of slow running on the system would be
investigated by the support teams.

9. Note that as stated earlier, corrupting the Message Log in this way has no impact
whatsoever on the Branch Accounts, since these never refer to the Message Log. The
Branch Accounts are based on copies of some of the data held in the Message Log being
stored in “working tables” within the BRDB. Clearly any application that is capable of
corrupting the Message Log in BRDB would also be capable of updating (i.e. corrupting)
the data used to calculate the Branch accounts.

Note that the relationship between data held in the Message Log and the Branch accounts is e complex.
Therefore, a significant amount of knowledge and skill would be required to attempt this.

It should be noted that since R12 (July 2015) all access and actions carried out by Super Users to
any database is strictly audited to an Oracle Audit table. The records in the Audit Table records
the following information:

e User Id of the Super User
¢ Action (e.g. Log On, Execute a SQL command, Log Off etc.)

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential - Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 142
POL00253246
POL00253246

e Date and Time of the action
e Actual SQL statement executed (where applicable)

This Audit Table is again extracted from BRDB soon after lam and the data picked up and sealed
before being copied to the Audit Server.

Note that it is possible for the Super User to manipulate the Audit table (including removing entries
from the table). However, should the table be removed entirely, then the database would stop
working. If only old entries are removed, then the removal of entries will be recorded, thus making
it clear that the table has been manipulated though the details of the changes would not be fully
visible.

Prior to R12, when the BRDB was upgraded to run on a later version of Oracle, (i.e. from 2010 to
July 2015), only Log On and Log Off activities by Super Users were audited. For all planned
access, then an MSC (Managed Service Change document) would have been signed off and the
Logs of the Super User activities would have been attached to the MSC. Therefore, a correlation
of Log On / Log Off activities of Super Users against MSCs should detect any rogue activities.

3. Detecting Changes to the Audit Trail

In order to make the changes to the Message Log described in section 0, the Super User would
need Read access to the Key Store database which runs on the NPS and Read / Write access to the
BRDB. Note that should the rogue application run on the BAL, then this isn’t necessary as the
BAL’s have access to the Key store based on the IP address.

Note that the BAL Private Key only needs to be accessed once as the same key is used for a year.
However the BRDB would need to be accessed each day that the Message Log is to be corrupted.

All such access by a Super User would be audited in the Audit Table; since R12 such logs would
show the activities carried out whilst logged on, and prior to R12 the logon (and logoff) events
would be recorded.

Therefore, should there be any allegations that any data has been corrupted, an examination of the
Database Audit tables should ensure that this has not occurred. Although the Database Audit
tables are not regularly examined they were recently checked as part of an external Audit of
Horizon Online and no issues were reported.

Old Horizon

On the old Horizon system, the mechanisms were very different from those used by Horizon
Online. Section 4 provides an overview of how the Riposte Message store operates, then section 5
describes the Riposte Audit Trail. Finally section 6 shows how injections of messages by a super
users would be detected in the audit trail.

4. Overview of Riposte

All Counter data was held in a bespoke Message Store which was part of the Riposte product
supplied by Escher Inc. This data was replicated within each Branch to all counter positions and
from each Branch to the Data Centres where it was held in the Correspondence Server Message
Stores. Similarly, any data inserted into the Message Store at the Data Centre (e.g. Reference Data
or authorisations for Banking Transactions) would be replicated back to the Branch Counters.

Selected data was then extracted from the Correspondence Servers to update Post Office Ltd’s
Back End systems.

POL00253246
POL00253246

All accounting at the counter was carried out based on the data held in the Message Store. The
Riposte product managed the Message Store and it did not allow any message to be updated or
deleted. Therefore all that could be done to corrupt the data in the Message Store was to inject
additional messages which could then influence the Branch accounts. Such injections were possible
at the Correspondence Server for users with sufficient access permissions.

Each message included 3 key bits of information which together provided a unique identification
for each message:

e Group ID: this was the 6 digit FAD Code of the Branch with which the message was
associated

¢ Node ID: This indicated the Counter Position at which the message was originally written
for messages generated at the Counter or the Correspondence Server identifier for
messages generated at the Data Centre. Counter Node Ids where between I and 31, and
Correspondence Server Node Ids where between 32 and 63.

¢ Message ID: A unique number for each Group ID / Node ID. This number starts at 1 for
the first message written at that Node, and increase by I for each subsequent message. This
allows checks to be made that no messages are missing as that would result in gaps in the
sequence of Message IDs

The concept of jsns used in Horizon Online was based on this.

Messages also have an associated “Expiry Date”. This indicates the number of days after the
message is first written before it can be deleted. An archive process ran on each counter and
Correspondence Server at around 3am which deleted all messages that were past their Expiry Date,
thus ensuring that the Message Store did not continue to grow indefinitely.

Some special messages which are referred to as “Persistent Objects” did not expire in this way but could be
removed afier they were replaced.

However again they were all held for a minimum of 34 days and in general were not relevant to generating
the Branch Accounts,

In particular, Riposte was configured such that no messages where allowed to expire until they
were at least 34 days old. This was to allow for counters that were offline for a significant period.

Each message also had an associated CRC, this was basically a checksum that was included to
ensure that the message had not become accidently corrupted. Note that this was not a
cryptographically secure seal and it would be possible for a sufficiently technically skilled person to
alter a message and recalculate the CRC if they had access to the message outside the message
store.

Due to the size of the Post Office Network, Branches were split into 4 separate Clusters. Each Cluster included 4
Correspondence Servers (2 in each Data Centre), thus ensuring that there were normally 4 copies of the data held
in the Data Centres.

5. The Riposte Audit Trail

An Audit Application was run on the Correspondence Servers to take an audit copy of all data
visible to that Correspondence Server.

The Audit Application was run on one Correspondence Server on each Cluster in each Data Centre. This
means that there were two independent Audit Trails for each Branch. However when retrieving the data only
one Audit Trail was used.

This application read every record that was visible to that Correspondence Server (i.e. all data in
that Cluster) and wrote a text copy of that data to a text file. Each Audit application wrote data to
10 text files (based on one of the digits in the FAD Code) and when the text file got to a certain
size it was closed and a new file created for that text stream. The file included a hash value of the

© Deloitte 2018 Private and Confidential - Subject to Legal Privilege - DRAFT 144
POL00253246
POL00253246

file contents to ensure that should it be accidentally corrupted, then this would be detected. Also
around lam each day the file was swapped thus ensuring that data associated with a given day was
in discrete files.

Once these files had been written they became visible to the Audit server which would pick the files
up and Seal them and store them until they are retrieved or deleted.

This process was not changed for Horizon Online.

Deletion of Audit records is currently suspended. They should be deleted after 7 years, but deletion was
switched off sometime in 2014 (I think). Therefore all audit records since sometime in 2007 should be
available. Those from before that time are no longer available.

If the audit trail is retrieved, then similar checks to those carried out on Horizon Online were made,
namely:

e Each entire Audit File is checked to ensure that the digital seal stored at the time the Audit
was produced (i.e. the day after the transactions took place) is valid.

Normally a Data retrieval will be for a number of days and so a number of Audit files will need to be
retrieved. There would also normally be a number of audit files for each day.

¢ The data for the Branch in question is then filtered out from these audit files and checks are
then carried out on a counter by counter basis as described below for the period of the
extract:

o No part of the Audit Data is missing or duplicated. This is done by ensuring that
there are no missing or duplicate Message Ids for each counter / CS. The standard
Audit Extracts into Excel include a report indicating that this check has been
successfully carried out.

o The CRC is recalculated and confirmed as correct for the message.

6. Detecting Changes to the Audit Trail

If a malicious Super User wished to interfere with the Branch’s Data, then that would need to be
done by injecting messages into the Correspondence Server or Counter Message stores using the
Riposte APIs. Support Staff did have the capability (and occasional need) to do this at the
Correspondence Server. Processes where in place to ensure that any such messages included
information as to who had done this. Such information would not be visible in the standard audit
extracts (but would be visible in a detailed examination of the raw audit data). Clearly any
malicious corruption would be done without such trace information. However, if such data were
injected at the Correspondence Server, it would be clear that this had occurred since the Node Id
associated with the message would be that of the Correspondence Server at which the message had
been injected and not a normal Counter Node Id. This would be clearly visible in any audit extract.

Postmaster’s View

The Horizon system records all transactions and uses its records to generate a view of how much
cash and other items of value should exist in a branch at any time. Subpostmasters are required to
carry out daily cash balances where they should check that the cash they hold in their tills
corresponds to what the system says they should have. If the system has been manipulated to
present a false view of the cash they hold in the branch this should be immediately obvious when
they carry out these daily processes.

In the theoretical scenario that a Super User has manipulated the transactions for a Branch they
thus have to address the problem of making the physical cash or some other representation of
value, appear in, or disappear from, the Branch without triggering any investigation.
