As a result of assurances received, i.e. that when the rationalisation

Crown Office Network

We are still awaiting the meeting with the Post Office on the issue of
the consultation process.

A meeting was held with Mr D Brodala, PONU, Director of
Franchising, to discuss the Business idea for an “alternative to
franchising, of more benefit to the staff’. The Assistant Secretary will
give a verbal report at the PE meeting.

The Assistant Secretary met with the Bristol & District Amal Branch
to instigate a campaign following the announcement to franchise the
Queens Road Crown Office. The campaign will include contract with
press and media sources locally. In addition, the staff have been told
not to co-operate with the Post Office re-deployment plans and further
that we intend to ballot them for Industrial Action to oppose this
decision.

the probable losses as a consequence of AI. I have sought from Royal
Mail the Requirements document produced for the tender and for the
Contract and Solutions provided by Locheed Martin. Once we have
these documents we will be in a better position to evaluate the project.
