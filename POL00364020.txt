In that case, I’ll leave the matter in your hands. Unless you disagree, I won’t delve into long notes that you sent
me last night until you have bottomed this out, one way or the other. The explanation (it is not an an answer)
may be that when Fujitsu talk about not having any process for deleting branch transaction or financial data, they
mean deleting data relating to whole transactions that have been entered into and are recorded on the system. Is
the kind of deletion were talking about is nothing like that?

One of the problems with this kind of last minute firefighting is that takes us away from our priority jobs. I need
to spend the rest of the weekend reviewing the draft opening submissions.

Subject: RE: Data deletion

Dear Andy,

TP’ve been reviewing TG’s and SP’s witness statements and summarise below the things that they have each said
about remotely deleting transaction/financial data. In short, I don’t think the problem just lies with para 59 of TG
and it looks to me as if SP may have to correct at least his first statement and possibly his second also.

Until we know how this happened — which requires explanations from TG and Spink as to what they were
thinking — we cannot decide how or even whether we can present this to the court in a way that does not destroy
FJ’s credibility.

TG

TG (thankfully?) only deals with this in his first statement. In summary, he says the following things in the
following paras:

17. There are only four sources of transaction data. The fourth is via remote access — he specifies BTs on
Horizon online and transaction injections in Legacy horizon. No reference to remote editing or deleting.

57. He is not aware of any way that FJ could theoretically edit or delete transaction data. He also makes it clear
that this is all largely hypothetical — other than one BT, he is not aware of FJ ever having edited or deleted
transaction data.

58.10 Under the heading “Balancing Transactions”, having dealt with the one BT on Horizon online, he breezily
refers to Legacy Horizon transaction injections, implying that they happened but not saying so clearly and not
giving any sense of how often it happened.

59.1 Under the heading “Privileged Users”, he says (1) that PUs’ editing or deleting transaction data is only a
theoretical possibility which would require circumvention of controls, (2) that there is no policy, process or
practice calling for t Pus to edit or delete transaction data and (3) that as far as he is aware, FJ has never used PU
rights to edit or delete transaction data.

59.2 He says PU editing or deleting data is not part of the functionality of Horizon because other tools such as
TCs and BTs are enough.

59.3 He refers to PU changes to the BRDB as hypothetical only.
POL00364020
POL00364020

61. He indicates that as far as he is aware there is no other way FJ can remotely affect transaction data or other
branch account data.

Parker
In summary, Parker 1 says:
11. Roll’s account of editing and deleting branch data is incorrect and misleading.

19. The suggestion that FJ edited or deleted transaction data is not correct. He confirms TG1 para 37 that in
Legacy Horizon it was not possible to edit/delete messages committed to the message store.

55.4 Interestingly, Parker describes a form of remote data deletion here — deleting all the data in a faulty counter
in Legacy Horizon. So there may be a partially face-saving distinction to be drawn between deleting counter data
and deleting message store data. But I doubt that this distinction will help us with deletion in Horizon online.

55.6 He cannot think of any other incidents of remotely accessing counters.
In summary, Parker 2 says:

34. SSC is hugely reluctant to change financial data — not ther job and they recognised the seriousness of doing
so.

Below is a summary of the point we discussed earlier.

I've attached:

1. Our long briefing note on remote access — data deletion is covered at page 20. This note is still to vetted by FJ
but is built on all their mini reports.

2. The FJ original report on data deletion (that has been largely carried across into 1).

3. The key Peak with all the horrible stuff about FJ deleting data — which is very messy.

This matter has been escalated to Rob Houghton.

Subject: URGENT - support needed over the weekend

Matthew and all at FJ

I'm sorry to drop this late on Friday but we have come across a point that could be a major problem. We will
need this urgently addressed over the weekend as it may require an amendment to Torstein's evidence on
Monday. I'm around all weekend on my mobile if easier to discuss with someone.

At para 59.1 of Torstein's first statement he says that as far as he is aware a privileged user has never deleted
transaction data from the BRDB.

In the attached note (under Section 2 and Section 4) it appears that SSC are deleting transaction data when there
is a stuck session that is stopping a counter from working. If true this appears to contradict Torstein's evidence

because I understand that "a session" holds transaction data.

The associated Peaks make clear that this is happening using APPSUP, which as we determined yesterday is a
POL00364020
POL00364020

form of Privileged User access.

Hi

Due to the circumstances at the branch this session can be removed but the branch must be made aware that if
there are any losses/gains from removing it then they will be liable.

Please note, in future any requests of this nature that do not have the applicable form attached which shows what
the transaction was for, date etc will not be actioned by FSC until this form is received as this allows us to
investigate the incident.

Thanks

To resolve this I need to run the following SQL on a BRDB instance

delete from brdb_branch_user_sessions

where branch_accounting_code = 111832

and fad_hash = 124

and node_id = 2

and session_status = 'FAILED' or session_status = 'RECOVERING'

PLease can you authorise the unix team to grant me the "set role appsup" permission.

What is the next course of action then?

POL have previously authorised removal of a session that is not related to travel money card plenty of times in
the past.

There even appears to be an established process for this.

Hi Jackie,

Apologies for this late response.
We already sent to POL the session correction form and just awaiting for their approval.
We’ll let you know as soon as we have receive a response.

In the attached note from FJ (in response to Coyne 3.271), there is the following comment:

"For these types of incident Fujitsu have not affected any transactional information that has been committed by
the branch and therefore will not affect the branch accounts. Session and Recovery tables use transitory
information to provide standard recovery business rules, however they cannot be exercised in the case when a
counter has been removed. The only option is to remove such information."

Is there a distinction between what Torstein has said and what is happening above? When Torstein refers to
POL00364020
POL00364020

"transaction data" does he mean something different? Or is the above not transaction data?

Earlier in the same note (section 2), the following comment is made in relation to a different incident:

3.267 [Coyne] said: "It has previously been said by Post Office that whilst Fujitsu could modify transaction data
to perform corrective fixes, they would not have delete capabilities (see paragraph 9.24 of my original report)."

In this case the session recovery had to be marked as completed (which removed it from site at the branch but
not from audit)

Again, how is this different, if at all, from Torstein's statement that deletion of transaction data from the BRDB
cannot happen?

I would be grateful if a full explanation could be provided as a matter of urgency. I'd also be grateful for
Torstein's input on whether his statement needs correcting?

Kind regards
Andy

3. comments on WBD's paper on "Peaks with evidence of remote access"; - This is 3.277, I don’t believe I have

Matthew, Dave,

Please would you provide an update in relation to the remote access requests below? When can we expect to
receive the information requested?

We intend to use some of the information that we have already requested in relation to remote access to produce
an additional witness statement from Steve and/or Torstein. I'm producing drafts now with a view to circulating
them internally today and sharing them with you shortly after that. Can Torstein be available to review and
comment before Tuesday?

We also need Torstein to consider whether it is necessary for him to correct certain aspects of his first witness
statement in light of Coyne's supplemental report and the Claimants’ supplemental witness evidence. I will send
you a note on that shortly. I'm aware that he has Bond Solon training today — can we arrange for him to look at
this after that?

Kind regards
