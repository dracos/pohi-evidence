Terms of Reference for Independent Expert

Background

Horizon is the electronic point of sale IT system used in all Post Office branches. Each branch is
responsible for logging the transactions conducted within that branch onto the Horizon system.

On occasions, there may be discrepancies between the actual cash and stock levels in branch and the
recorded cash and stock levels in Horizon. These discrepancies can be either shortages or surpluses.

There are nearly 12,000 branches in the Post Office network. The majority of these are run by
subpostmasters. Under the standard subpostmaster's contract, a subpostmaster is liable for any
shortages in cash or stock in his/her branch caused by his/her (or their employeesâ€™) carelessness,
negligence or error.

Over the last few years, there have been a growing number of complaints from subpostmasters that the
Horizon system is unreliable. They allege that errors in the Horizon system have falsely created losses
that do not actually exist.

This ultimately led to the formation of a group called the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA). A
group of MPs lead by the Rt Hon James Arbuthnot MP also became interested in this issue after
receiving letters from subpostmasters in their constituencies.

In response, Post Office set up an independent inquiry into the Horizon system led by Second Sight (who
are independent forensic accountants and fraud examiners). Second Sight was tasked with investigating
whether there are any systemic issues and/or concerns with the Horizon system, including its training
and support processes.

Second Sight rendered its Interim Report on 8 July 2013. Its preliminary conclusion was that it had so far
found no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems with the Horizon software. However it did
highlight a number of areas in relation to wider support and training around the Horizon system that
required further investigation.

Post Office is now extending the Second Sight Inquiry into a Mediation Scheme so that individual
Subpostmasters have an opportunity to raise their concerns direct to Post Office. The Mediation
Scheme will be supervised by a Working Group comprising of Post Office, Second Sight and JFSA.
