Hi Paula

Quick update for you;

- as you know Susan has spoken to Alan Bates and also contacted Janet in JA's office

- both Susan and I have been in touch with Will Gibson and I will speak to him this morning to update

- in reference to your question about Mr Griffiths, his contract adviser was in touch with his family once he heard about this to
express our sympathy and concern. I have suggested he contacts again today to ask after him. No suggestion in those calls this was a
suicide attempt.

- we haven't had any media calls. Susan has arranged for specialist media law cover to be in place given the complexity of this case

- if we were to get a media call we would issue a holding line - "our thoughts are with Mr Griffiths and his family. We are urgently
investigating the background to this case."

- we would at the same time look for legal guidance around advice to any media organisation in relation to the background to the
issue

I will update you this morning.

Mark

He clearly doesn't (or doesn't want to) trust us. Who is closest to him do you think?

is, as we move to mediation and trying to build trust in that process for his members.

>> Alan has just rung back to say that the message re car accident was a mis-communication from a family member and that it was
definitely a suicide attempt.
>> Angela and I will agree how to handle this tomorrow, as the facts re the sub postmaster are not as represented by the email.
