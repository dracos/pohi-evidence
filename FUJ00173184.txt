Having all the events gathered together in a lump makes things very difficult for the prosecution team. What
it means is that any query for which there are days with no events must include the catch-up lump day.

[the Audit Data extract for July 01 to July 14 2015 fails with ‘Filtering Failed’ message. Perl Error log shows:

fhe supplied date Tue Jul 14 23:59:59 2015
dinus the largest message date found 20150706 is greater than 1. Files need to be extracted with a bigger upper date.

It ran the ARQ for 2 branches and the result was the same. When ARQ is run for the entire month the query completes and the gaps
lin the Events data is visible. The Events spreadsheet shows there are no events between July 3 and July 10 (see attached) but
there is transaction data between those dates.

It gathered the event data EVENTS EDS1 from 1st July 2015 to 31st August 2015 and then the problem became clearer.

It attach the spread sheet "Date Gathered” which illustrates the problem.

[tt has a column “Date Gathered". None are gathered from 7th July to 21st July but on the 22nd July you can see all the missing
event files, all of which are much bigger than usual.

It shall keep the original PEAK on the audit-dev stack for considering what to do about this issue from an audit point of view.

However something has definitely gone wrong with the event generation. There were no events to be gathered from 7th July to 21st
\fuly 2015 but then lots were gathered on 22nd.

Ir think the problem is down to the fact that the design is such that the product relies on a high water mark as the basis for
selecting the latest set of records. If the service has been down for any time, for whatever reason, then there will be a larger
set of records to retrieve and hence a larger file size will occur.

the script runs continuously as a service. It has a built in delay of an hour. Any modification would therefore require a design
change.

This issue goes back to 2015. We are not aware of any other, more recent service/monitoring issues.
s previously suggested any improvements would therefore require a design change.
