Dear Susan

| have spoken to the various clerks re availability/fees.
Cloth Fair Chambers

Both Nicholas Purnell QC (NP) and lan Winter QC (IW) are available next week though NP is away after next
Thursday so may struggle to do any follow up work after a conference. IW is around. | have their times of availability.

NP's hourly rate is £800. IW's hourly rate is £600.
If we assume 3 hours to read in followed by a 2 hour conference NP will charge c £4k. IW will charge c £3k
2 Bedford Row

Brian Altman QC (BA) is available and his clerk was the most engaged offering a free 20 discussion with Brian to set
things up.

BA is available next week on Tuesday - Friday and his hourly rate is £550. Conference with him will cost c £2.5k

He is no longer First Treasury Counsel (from 1 July) but he has the ear of the DPP/AGs Office
He is on holiday from 30 July for a few weeks.
QEB Hollis Whiteman

Mark Ellison QC (ME) - had a helpful clerk. He is engaged nearly full time in the Patrick Lawrence Enquiry and ME has.
told a select committee that he will spend most of his time on that though he is free to give advice from time to time.
He becomes free from the enquiry next January

ME is around next week until Thursday. Mark was First Treasury Counsel. His charge rate is between £250 - £550 per
hour

Interestingly his clerk said that if Mark's availability was too restricted she could offer Sir David Calvert-Smith.

http:/Avww.gebholliswhiteman.co.uk/queen-s-counsel/sir-david-calvert-smith.aspx

He has just stepped down as a High Court Judge and is a former DPP (1998 -2003). He is available to advise on
policy matters such as this. His charge rate is £350 - £400 per hour.

| hope this helps. Happy to talk through the options with Simon if you would like

Dear Susan

As discussed yesterday | set out below a list of possible candidates for you to consider:

From speaking to colleagues here at BD | understand that Cloth Fair Chambers are expensive (reassuringly?). They
do seem to me to have the right mix of criminal knowledge but acting for corporates.

Brian Altman QC is interesting in that he is First Treasury Counsel (though his practice is not big on fraud cases).
Simon points out the possible attraction politically of having First Treasury Counsel on board.

Mark Ellison QC is a big hitter with plenty of political experience.

The last two counsel | have added because of their financial services/crime backgrounds.

Our steer would be one of the first 4 above (and of course availability will play a major part of the decision)
Simon and | are happy to discuss in a call if that would help.

Advice on adjudications will follow today.
