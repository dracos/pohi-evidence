Status update - February

. Operational cost reduction: YTD savings as a result of the release of agency staff in TAM & Branch Standards teams (as at
end pd 9) is £52.8k. This activity generates savings of £143k for 14/15 with full year effect savings of £508k. Impact of the
changes to audit admin and training detailed within HR1 show reduction of 27 FTE FSA and 3 FTE FTL as a consequence of
Branch Support Programme, with a release date of 23" Feb 2015 for VR & CR. No pd 9 impact but in year effect for 14/15 is
£91k with full effect savings of £947k.

. Bureau de Change 2™ receipt: the transaction for customers paying by debit or credit card for bureau transactions was
changed in Sept 2014 to include an automatic re-print of the receipt which includes the card and identification details of the
customer, which needs to be presented in case of fraudulent use of the card. Since the change FSC has received 96
Chargebacks totalling £188k. 95 branches were able to provide a copy of the 2™ receipt, resulting in no chargeback to POL or
branch.

. Cheque Rem out: the end of day cheque remittance process has been reviewed and a new solution to drive out errors has been
identified. This should reduce calls into NBSC (650 per month) and the Transaction Corrections (c.570 pm periods 1-5 2014)
issued by Finance Service Centre. CAF has been processed detailing cost of £109k with savings of £85k pa from reduction in 3
FTEs at FSC and 0.5 FTE at NBSC however the go live has been delayed from March to May due to capacity issues in the
previous release. Recalculated savings for 15/16 are £63.8k

. HORIce : The pilot has proved that this is a valuable tool for focusing on any one particular branch. We are currently working
with Fujitsu to refine the outputs of HORIce so that it highlights anomalies in branch performance across the whole network. The
capabilities of HORIce were showcased in meeting on 6" Jan when the effectiveness of HORIce was fully assessed by the BAU
teams taking part in the pilot. Next HORIce pilot review meeting 3 February.

. On-line training: go-live for training has been rescheduled to 6" Feb to enable sufficient user testing to take place. This will not
affect the forecast savings as the HR1 timeline resource release is 23rd Feb. Project brief accepted by Gating forum 19"
December 2014. Project is on track.

. 15/16 savings: BSP activity in Dec and Jan - (1) NBSC have produced high level plan to identifying activity required to achieve
the forecast 25% reduction in call volumes (2) FSC to identify further efficiencies from a forecast reduction in the number of
Transaction Corrections issued and investigated

Baton Passing E>

* To ensure that forecast savings are delivered in 2015-16, activities need to be
baton passed to the appropriate budget holder and formal acknowledgment
gained

¢ 17 batons have been identified

¢ It is recommended that delivery of the these batons form personal objectives
for the budget holders, who will be expected to accept the baton with an
electronic signature

¢ Where roles have been removed from the 14/15 template this has flowed
trough to 15/16 template. If New Baton Owners want to put costs back in for
2015-16, new Business Cases will need approval

¢ Full Year savings start from 1 April 2015. Any slippage must be recouped later
in the year, so that the Full Year total is still achieved

¢ New Baton Owner is based on the current structure. If this changes, the baton
and objective will need to pass to the new budget owner

Top 8 ks

R001. Fujitsu and internal POL IT teams do
not have resource to deliver Programme
changes which is significantly impacting on
delivery date

R002. Majority of savings costs are through
people/resource savings, increasing risk of
surplus pool

ROO3. Other pressures on time creating
inability to mobilise work streams

R004. Subpostmasters and operators don't
embrace new on-line training methods

R005. Reduction in spmr suspensions,
increases net debt figure

R006. Perceived conflicting cost reduction
initiatives have resulted in lack of
engagement and support for BSP initiatives
in FSC and NBSC which may result in
failure to achieve forecast staff savings in
both areas

R007. Call reduction into NBSC may not be
realised

Plan to be produced by IT mapping areas for
change, priorities and resource required. Plan for
escalations within Fujitsu need to be made available
to stakeholders

Plan to be created across Programme where
resource efficiencies are identified. Vacancies to be
sourced on temporary basis or not filled where there
is a reduction

Steering group to review area representation on
Programme and ensure priorities are clearly
communicated

Involvement throughout in on-line build and testing
of solutions. Planned phases of delivery to ensure
buy-in. Engagement with Multiple business partners.

Number of suspensions, reasons and impact on
overall debt being monitored. HORIce will enable
earlier intervention.

Regular conversations with FSC and NBSC teams,
including offers of support, visits to Chesterfield and
Dearne 6" and 7" Jan 2015 to agree improvement
activities and subsequent efficiencies for 15/16
onwards delivery.

Review BAU operational plan with NBSC and
identify metric for identifying “exceptional activity”
