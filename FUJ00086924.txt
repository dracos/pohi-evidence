Hi Andy

You asked that we formally respond to the Draft Ernst and Young Management Letter Mark and I have undertaken a review of each
of their findings and below are our responses. One key point we do feel needs addressing though is the classification of these and
how this has been arrived at as Ernst and Young classifications may not be the same as PO Ltd’s or Fujitsu’s view.

1. Item 1 - Improve Governance of outsourcing Application Management — [i Is according to Don being rewritten we
agree to respond when we see the revised version

2. Item 2 - strengthen the password parameters— 4 The Password policy in SVM/SEC/POL/0003 RMG BU Security Policy
we need to amend section 11.2.5 in the next review of the policy, provided agreement is obtained from Architects, and if
there is a reason this cannot be met in any systems document the reason as a risk. — Action lan Howard, Amit Apte

Also we will send out a Cascade to all users especially SAP and Linux and remind them of the policy and guidelines .
Initialise a BAU monthly report concerning passwords to provide assurance to PO Ltd that this is being managed ongoing. -
action lan Howard and Donna Munro

3. Item 3 Review of Privileged Access— fai. A project has been established by Stephen Long to review all user management
and is being led lan Howard. — action lan Howard all areas of the account.

A clear segregation of duties guideline is required for Senior Management and Line managers/Assignment managers to
ensure that development and test are clearly separated from live in all technological and staff areas. If it is not possible to
do this then risks identifying why this is not the case should be documented and assessed. - Action lan Howard, Donna
Munro

segregation of Development and Test systems, a review of OLA’s, SLA’s , NDA’s and Contractual agreements is required to
ensure this. — Action lan Howard, Peter Beresford, Marc Daniel Lamaziere, Tony Atkinson, Peter Thompson.

Bill

Just been speaking to E&Y. They have to report to the Audit Committee at the back end of next week and they have asked for the
responses to the 10 recommendations. Now I reminded them that you had already stated that you couldn't start this work until the 9"
May due to leave / work pressures etc. but I think it would be prudent to make some statement against the individual
recommendations even if it is ‘ No concrete plan as yet, we are in the process of developing our plan of action.’ Or some such
phrase. It may well be that you have progressed a number of these to be able to state something more positive, but can you look to
get a response against each 10 recommendations by the middle of next week (18"" May), so we can agree this before its submitted.
I think a response, even if it is to say where we are, is better than none and gives more comfort.

As for the re-write that was worked up with Don and submitted to E&Y, I can’t say for a fact, but I believe they have removed the
whole summary part but left the rest, which would be the 10 recommendations. I'll let you know more when I do.

Regards

Andy
