are integrated with the owning class (i.e.: DSS, POCL, Customer). Where the enquiries are from
Beneficiaries, but do not relate to the delivered Horizon solution, they are integrated into class 4
(Other).

Other: Contains ‘Other’ enquiry type calls as defined above plus all calls made that arise from ‘Inappropriate’
calls such as ‘wrong telephone’ number connection.

POCL (Non-Serv): All calls placed with Horizon System Helpdesk that embrace non- System Service calls (currently
equates to Implementation, Environmental, Training, Advice & Guidance etc.)

Active: Cards which have been used for the cashing of benefits during the reporting period. Aggregated
Weekly.

e CALL TO RESOLUTION

‘A’ Priority: Logged calls that reflect a fault which has ‘resulted in substantial impact on all automated counter
positions in the outlet’.
‘B’ Priority: Logged calls that reflect a fault which has ‘resulted in substantial impact on an automated counter

position, but not all automated counter positions in the outlet’.

e OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS

Cumulative: Service level achievement, as a percentage, of the total actual time operational system has been
available to deliver service.
Discrete: Service level achievement, as a percentage, of the total actual time loss in discrete values of 15

minutes. When active will result in a percentage value of 0% and be declared as a discrete number
representing the ‘blocks’ of 15 minute time intervals occurring during relevant system failure.

« NETWORK SYSTEMS

Branch WAN: Represents the ISDN communications link into the post Office outlet.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. APPROACH

This document contains those reports and information necessary for the Service Management Forum to review delivery of the
contract by ICL Pathway.

The issue of this document is an interim solution to meet the need to have data presented at the Service Review Forum and as
such will have a short life span. It will be replaced during 1998 by the issue of a Service Review Book direct from the ICL
Pathway Customer Services Service Level Agreement Monitor (SLAM).

Until such time as SLAM Review Book establishment circulation in this current draft format will be limited and controlled
by the Author.

1.2 INTERPRETATION

Interpretation of data, beyond report label classification, can be further qualified by the author as required.

1.3 REVIEW BOOK CONSTRUCTION

This book is sectioned by those key areas against which initial Service Management Reviews will be conducted. Within
each key area there can be presented up to four elements comprising of:

Volumes & Profiles (Optional)
.

Service Performance (Mandatory - where applicable)
.

Exception Reports (Where applicable)

Ad-Hoc Reports (Where applicable)

Summary.

The Release 1C service remained stable during August, with no new problem reports being opened.

New Problem Reports

None

WIP Update

Incomplete Transactions

Incomplete transactions have been causing concern for some months. A number of causes for such instances have been
identified and there is close working between POCL Service Management and ICL Pathway towards resolution. Software fixes to
minimise the opportunity for error are nearing the completion of their testing. However, because amendments to counter
procedures will be involved a CP will need to be raised.

Authentication of Users to Helpdesks - One Shot Passwords

Discussions between Pathway and PDA Security have brought agreement on a procedure close. Dave King has requested that a
formal Change Proposal be raised to cover the process. This CP is being impacted within Pathway and the High Level Design for
the application to support the agreed authentication process has been prepared. Forecast closure - Oct 1998.

Cards expiring at Post Offices before being collected

Existing beneficiaries are being nominated for new cards long before their current order books expire. In cases where benefit is
paid four-weekly, the trigger point used by CAPS is 8 weeks in advance of the last foil being used. The system is required to
expire uncollected cards after 56 days (8 weeks) and so in many cases the card expires as soon as it is received at the post
office. As a temporary measure, in order to reduce unnecessary cost and inconvenience to customers and post masters, the card
expiry time has been set to 90 days.

3.4

CAPS raised a CR (C0073) to formalise the temporary measure and Pathway have responded with a CCN - CCN307a was
delivered to Horizon on 30/7/98 and a response is awaited. An optimum requirement is expected in due course.

Card Batch Reconciliation Procedure at Post Office

Card batch reconciliation is the process currently carried out by a post office clerk on receipt of a new card batch from De La Rue
Card Systems, prior to issuing a card to a customer. The purpose of this process is to check the integrity of the card batch.

Recent experience suggests that card reconciliation at the post office is onerous and time consuming for the post office clerk,
delays the issue of cards to the customer, and incurs an unnecessary cost for Pathway. Cards are being swiped through several
times. This causes a card and PUN re-order because the system then believes the card to be faulty or the card reader is faulty
(known as a Surplus to Batch Problem).

Action is required to reinforce the Batch Reconciliation Procedures at post offices.

CCN232, which seeks to modify this process at NR2+, was submitted to Horizon for approval and comments were received.
Following subsequent discussion with Horizon a new version of CCN232 (232b) has been provided to Horizon.

A response is awaited. Forecast closure - Oct 1998

Closed Since Last Report
Network Congestion

There were communication failures on 13" July in the South West due to network congestion on the Energis Waddon Switch.
High volumes of recalls/reissues had been initiated due to the DSS streamlining of other benefit databases with Child Benefit and
some 80 of these recall/reissues were affected. The relevant payments were thus not available for 45 minutes or so, rather than
the standard 15 minutes. The network congestion was caused by insufficient capacity being made available by Energis and this
has now been rectified.

DSS Changing Customer Details Triggers New PUNs and Cards

Apparently through DSS merging beneficiary details (where the beneficiary is in receipt of a benefit other than Child Benefit), such
changes to customer details trigger the issue of a new Card and PUN even if the beneficiary already has a valid card.
Beneficiaries are calling PCHL to ask why they have received a new PUN and there is unnecessary card and PUN production
activity. Although there is no fault with the system, Pathway have been investigating a change to prevent the automatic
production of new cards/PUNs in such circumstances. Such a change will be in place for NR2+.

Overall Comments
[The volume of general coded PCHL calls were slightly lower during August, reduced to 39% (July 40%) of all calls. Of these
calls, 42% were referred on to the DSS and an additional 29% were enquiry’s regarding the A1 Benefit Form, accounting for
16% and 11% respectively, of the total number calls.

The total volume of HSHD calls significantly increased during the month, primarily due to the level of implementation calls
(617). The increase in Environment coded calls for August was contributed to by the 38 reported power supply problems.

The level of Hardware coded calls also increased during the month due to the increase in printer and monitor problems. The
level of reported printer problems was contributed by the known ‘line-spacing’ error which has a work-around in place and the
resolution to the known ‘Monitor Fuse’ problem will continue over this quarter.

Operations coded calls decreased significantly during August to 57 (down from July’s 85) with reported Cash Account and
Daily reconciliation reported problems reduced by over 50% from July.

CALL TO RESOLUTION

Overall Comments

Hardware coded calls increased during the month of August. Printer and monitor problems remain the most
prevalent of the Hardware coded calls, however, a work-around for the known printer ‘Line-Spacing Error’ is
in place and the resolution to the known ‘Monitor Fuse’ problem will continue over this quarter.

The volume of reported Software coded calls also increased slightly during August, which was partly
contributed by ‘New user Login’ problems encountered by relief Post Office staff.

Network call volumes remain steady with 4 problems reported during August.

SLA’s relating to this section are listed. Reporting will commence progressively after evaluation of initial
results arising post- Release 1C implementation.
