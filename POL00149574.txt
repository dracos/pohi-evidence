Commercial in confidence - ExCo presentation
dodo (2) (2).pptx

Please find attached a selection of slides for possible use at ExCo tomorrow.

I am not sure how Paula will want to play this so this pack can be cut any which way. The only slides missing are costs
and Scheme facts and figures which I will add in tomorrow.

I did not plan to hand all these out to everyone — just have them as a prompt for Me/Mark/Chris depending how the
meeting goes. That is whether we discuss options or handling.

lll look over them again first thing and tidy up but this should give you the gist.

Best wishes
Belinda
