I have a few concerns regarding the office above as the amount of debt on the customer account is increasing by quite
large values each month, the current amount outstanding at the office is £28,191.03 which includes the amount being
recovered from remuneration. The total losses at the office since branch trading is £38,294.93.

2 weeks ago 3 TC were sent to the office regarding national Lottery
£10,208.00 Charge

£13,166.50 Charge

£4,032.80 Claim

The two charges have been settled centrally and the claim has been made good, there is also another £5k worth of
National Lottery TC's still to be issued to the office.

Witness Statement

(CJ Act 1967, s9; MC Act 1980, ss

and 5B, MC Rules 1981, r 70)

Statement of I GARETH IDRIS JENKINS

Ageifunder18 Over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18')

This statement (consisting of pages each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge

and belief and I make it knowing that, if it Is tendered In evidence, I shall be liable to .

prosecution if 1 have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe true.
Datedthe 8 dayof February 2010

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, working on the Post Office Account, formally ICL
Pathway Ltd, since 1996 as a Customer Solutions architect, involved in many aspects of design
and implementation of the computer system known as Horizon, This is a computerised
accounting system used by Post Office Ltd.

I have been asked if Issues found at Callender Square Post Office In Falkirk could have caused

“ the discrepancies in the case of SEEMA MISRA. At this stage, I am not aware of the details of

the problems in Callender Square Post Office in Falkirk. However I expect to be able to find out
the detalls of that case and also to compare the falling scenarios with the detailed logs that are
to be extracted for the SEEMA MISRA case and should then be able to make it clear if the
scenario is relevant. ,

I have been asked to make comments on the 3rd_Interim Technical expert's report to the
Court prepared by Charles Alastair McLachlan, a Director of Amsphere Consulting Ltd.

{ have listed below the statement contained within the above mentioned report in italics and
recorded my comment beneath In bold. For ease I have retained the original number
reference. .

1.2.1 Source of problem — End to end EPOSS transaction flow: the equipment failure
user guide provided identifies at subsection 14 a process for identifying lost EPOSS

Continuation of statement of GARETH IDRIS JENKINS.

transactions. The implication is that EPOSS transactions can be lost due to equipment
fallures. Without access to the sub post office data records and the intermediate data
records in the end to end process it will not be possible to identify the extent to which
this may explain the accounting discrepancies.

No request has been made to Fujitsu for any data relating to this branch. The logs would show
any equipment failures and replacement which might possibly relate to lost transactions.

1.2.2 Source of problem — Poor Integration: the helpdesk reports provided in Andy
Dunks 2nd statement Identify a serles of problems with the network, printer and the pin
terminal. It has not been possible to test whether this could give tise to inconsistent
data capture and transmission at the sub post office.

Not sure what this is about. What exactly is required?

1.2.3 Source of problem — systems Issues causing incomplete/inconsistent processing
of transactions between sub post office and central systems: the reports provided In
Andy.Dunks 2nd statement identify a number of cases in which the user was required to
‘re-boot’ ‘the terminal. It has not been possible to test whether this could give rise to
inconsistent data records In the sub post office.

Again without examining the logs it isn’t possible to progress this.

1.3. Hypothesis: Errors in operator data entry are not properly reconciled by the Post
Office finance function or by the Horizon system: without access to the system files it is
not possible to determine whether this is the case,

Again what is being requested? I've not seen any logs and I don't believe that they have been
requested so-how can this be progressed without them?

1.3.1. Source of problem — lack of reconciliation of EPOSS transactions end to end:

1.3.2 Source of problem =lack of reconciliation of other transactions end to end:
without access to the system data files it is not possible to determine whether this is the

case.

Agreed, so the Logs need to be retrieved and examined.

There is no reason to believe that the information in this statement is inaccurate because of the
improper use’of the computer. To the best of my knowledge and belief at all material times the
computer was operating properly, or If not, any respect In which it was not operating properly, or
was out of operation was not such as to effect the-information held on it. I hold a responsible
position in relation to the working of the computer.
