Subject: RE: [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE:COMMERCIAL] Submission on Post Office Horizon mediation
scheme

CLASSIFICATION: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE:COMMERCIAL
Laura,

The Minister noted the changes POL intend to make to the scheme and would be keen to get clarification on the
following points:

- Could you please clarify whether POL would mediate in any criminal cases and if so under what circumstances?

- Of the total number of cases (c109??) how many would not be mediated by POL (because they are criminal
cases)?

- Could the Minister please see an advance copy of the press notice/ press lines?

WMS: The Minister’s preference is to lay a WMS but, as this is a matter for the post office rather than the
Government, would like it to be a very short. Ideally it would be something along the lines of ‘I have received a letter/
document from Post Office with an update on the Horizon mediation process and I am placing a copy in the libraries
of both Houses’ — this would of course mean that we would need to liaise with Post Office to ensure that they
provided this to us in advance of the title being laid.

Hannah — Parly have advised that if were to lay a WMS we will need a grid slot — are you able to take this forward
please?

Thanks,

Claire

As discussed (and with thanks for the extension to the box deadline) please see attached submission for Jo Swinson on
the Post Office mediation scheme. I’d be grateful if this can go in the Minister’s box today flagged for her urgent
attention — in particular, we would welcome her early steer on whether she agrees with the decision not to table a
WMS for the day of this announcement.

Hannah in Comms has agreed our recommendation of a reactive, BIS-spokesperson line only.
Georgie — I'll be in touch separately about the WMS point.

Thanks
Laura
