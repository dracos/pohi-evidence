calculated using a tool called Flexible Planning, which
uses historical payment information

*Un-necessary costs are incurred to the business if
individual branches ignore the Flexible Planning

What you MUST do to manage IN @e)
cash effectively? Gee)

XHave cash on the counter in view of the public
XHold money “just in case”

XDo any more transactions in a stock after a cash declaration

the cash declaration has to be the last thing you do

XKeep un-useable notes and un-used coin in your branch —
remit these out as these still incur costs.
