1. Introduction
1.1 I have been instructed to prepare this report by Freeths LLP

1.2 My instructions are to produce a report that focuses on the agreed list
of issues as set out in the Schedule to the Court order dated 23 March
2018.

1.3 This report is based as far as reasonably possible on the Model Form of
Expert Report as developed by the Academy of Experts.

1.4 The report seeks to address the issues that concern the Horizon system
(as defined here) and which (a) arise on the parties’ generic statements
of case, (b) can be resolved by IT expert evidence, and (c) require

limited, if any, evidence of fact.
1.5 Definition:

“the Horizon System” is considered for the purposes of this list of issues
to mean “the Horizon computer system hardware and software,
communications equipment in branch and central data centres where
records of transactions made in branch were processed, as defined in
GPOC at §16 and as admitted by Post Office in itsDefence at §37."

1.6 This report provides a review of the Horizon system and its composition
from 1999 to present day.

Business Scope
1.7 The business scope of Horizon is recorded as :?
a. Point of Sale Application

b. Transaction Recording (and Auditing of transactions)

‘In accordance with the orders given by the Court at the CMC on 22 February 2018
? Witness Statement of Gareth Jenkins.pdf (Para 2.2), 5 October 2012 [C-0003632]

c. Posting Summary Transactions to POLSAP (Post Office Ltd.’s back
end accounting system)

d. Posting Detailed transactions to Credence (Post Office Ltd.’s back

end Management Information system)

e. Posting Remuneration Data to HRSAP (Royal Mail Group’s back end
Payroll system)

f. Delivering Client Data to Post Office Ltd.’s Clients (i.e. 3rd parties
that Post Office Ltd acts as an agent for)

1.8 Since branch accounts could be affected by data delivered to/from Post
Office back end systems and third-party clients, it is necessary to
consider all of these aspects in order to appropriately opine on issues
which are specific to branch accounts.

1.9 Within this report, the different issues have been grouped together in
order to address similar thematic issues within a single section. I
understand that Dr Worden will adopt a similar approach although he
may select a different method of grouping. The groups I have adopted

are:

a. Section 5 - ‘Horizon Bugs/Errors/Defects and Controls’ (Issues 1,
3, 4.and 6);

b. Section 6 - ‘Reconciliation and Transaction Corrections’ (Issues 5
and 15);

c. Section 7 - ‘Horizon Reporting - Facilities for Subpostmasters’
(Issues 2 and 14);

d. Section 8 - ‘Horizon Shortfalls - Data and Reporting for
Subpostmasters and Post Office’ (Issues 8 and 9); and

e. Section 9 - ‘Remote Access and Transaction Amendments’ (Issues
7,10, 11, 12 and 13).

1.10 The issues in numerical order are listed below for ease of reference.

Agreed List of Issues

Issue 1

1.11 To what extent was it possible or likely for bugs, errors or defects of the
nature alleged at §§23 and 24 of the GPOC and referred to in §§ 49 to
56 of the Generic Defence to have the potential to (a) cause apparent
or alleged discrepancies or shortfalls relating to Subpostmasters’ branch
accounts or transactions, or (b) undermine the reliability of Horizon
accurately to process and to record transactions as alleged at §24.1
GPOC?

Issue 2

1.12 Did the Horizon IT system itself alert Subpostmasters of such bugs,
errors or defects as described in (1) above and if so how?

Issue 3

1.13. To what extent and in what respects is the Horizon System “robust” and

extremely unlikely to be the cause of shortfalls in branches?

Issue 4

1.14 To what extent has there been potential for errors in data recorded
within Horizon to arise in (a) data entry, (b) transfer or (c) processing

of data in Horizon?

Issue 5

1.15 How, if at all, does the Horizon system itself compare transaction data
recorded by Horizon against transaction data from sources outside of

Horizon?

2. Background

2.1 This dispute arises from the action pursued by the Claimants
(Subpostmasters) against the Defendants, Post Office Limited (POL).

2.2 The Defendant (POL) currently operates a network of around 11,500
Post Office branches throughout the UK’, within which, a high number
of products and services are offered.

2.3 POL appoints a Subpostmaster (or manager equivalent) to run the

branch. The vast majority of Claimants are or were Subpostmasters.

2.4 In a number of limited circumstances, it is understood that some
branches have been run by a limited company through a Franchise
Agreement, or by a Crown Office employee, through a contract of
employment. For the purposes of this report, all categories will be

referred to as Subpostmasters.

2.5 Horizon comprises an Electronic Funds Transfer Point of Sale (EFTPOS)
retail and accounting system introduced by POL in Post Office branches
in or around 1999.

2.6 Post Office contracted with ICL Pathway Ltd (latterly Fujitsu Services)
and Horizon was initially piloted in 1996.

2.7 Horizon was updated frequently, at various periods with a major
amendment in 2010 known as “Horizon Online”, often referred to as
“HNG-X”.

2.8 After its introduction in 1999, many Subpostmasters reported
difficulties with the operation of Horizon.

2.9 It is reported by POL that Horizon processes 47 million transactions per

week.®

* Historically, at the launch of Horizon this number may have been 19,000 branches.

3. Executive Summary

3.1 In respect of Issue 1, it is agreed in the experts Joint Statement dated
4 September 2018, that bugs/errors/defects that existed within Horizon
have the potential to cause apparent or alleged discrepancies or
shortfalls relating to Subpostmaters’ branch accounts/transactions. It is
also agreed that evidence exists which shows that bugs/error/cfects
have caused actual discrepancies or _ shortfalls relating to
Subpostmasters’ branch account/transactions.

3.2 Each discovered bug/error/defect could have remained unresolved in
Horizon for varying periods of time. In my opinion there is the possibility
of other bugs/errors/defects existing within Horizon which have yet to

be discovered and resolved.

3.3 The sheer volume of Known Error Logs and reconciliation reports
confirm the wide-ranging extent of the impact of such
bugs/errors/defects. This evidence demonstrates that such
bugs/errors/defects would undermine the reliability of the Horizon

system to accurately process and record transactions.

3.4 In respect of Issue 2, as agreed in the experts Joint Statement, the
extent to which any IT system can automatically alert its users to bugs
within the system is necessarily limited. Whilst Horizon has some
automated checks which would detect certain bugs there are types of
bugs that would not be detected by such checks.

3.5 Horizon did contain alert messages that would notify a Subpostmaster
to certain instances of some counter level errors, but the wider
implications of the error would be unknown to the Subpostmaster.

3.6 However, there do not appear to be notifications issued either by
Horizon or by Fujitsu or Post Office where known bugs and defects have
been discovered. The exception may be in relation to the Suspense
account issue where Post Office say that Subpostmasters were notified,

although how they were notified has not been disclosed.

3.7 With regards to Issue 3, whilst the present-day version of Horizon,
supported by manual human support may now be considered as
relatively robust in the spectrum of computer systems used in
businesses today it has undergone major modifications in its history. It
is likely that in 1999 when it was first commissioned, and in 2010 when
it was significantly upgraded (to Horizon Online), it was less robust.
Horizon comprises a hugely complex estate of hundreds of interfacing

systems, each which exposes many potential points of error.

3.8 Post Office have stated that the Horizon system has changed 19,842°
times since its inception. I have identified that Horizon’s operation is
highly dependent upon timed system processes with reliance on data
messages being replicated until delivery which is often where faults

occur.

3.9 Fundamental in determining the robustness of Horizon is gaining an
understanding of the Post Office (and Fujitsu) manual business
processes applied when determining and handling the effects of
bugs/errors/defects. Therefore, when technical failures occur,
understanding the correlating manual processes, inputs and respective
fixes applied in each instance to remedy an imperfect system to a
reasonable level of robustness is key.

3.10 Horizon’s relative robustness does not mean that is thereby extremely
unlikely to be the cause of shortfalls. As agreed in the Joint Statement
between the experts, robustness does not mean perfection. We also
agree that the level of robustness may have increased or decreased
each time as the systems have changed. It is also known that
bugs/errors/defects have caused actual discrepancies and shortfalls in
branches.

3.11 Regarding Issue 4, it is agreed in the joint statement that the potential
exists for such errors in the data recorded within Horizon. Bugs errors

and defects that were known to Post Office, as well as those that were
not classified as “Known Issues” ultimately presented themselves as
errors in data entry, data transference and data processing. Due to the
nature of the complex and far reaching Horizon interfacing architecture

and real time services, such errors were unavoidable.

3.12 With regards to Issue 5, reconciliation (the nature by which Post Office
and Horizon compares transaction data recorded by Horizon against
transaction data from sources outside of Horizon) is a large and complex
facility. It involves many different streams of electronic processing from
both Fujitsu data centre computing components, multiple “external
clients”, Post Office and Fujitsu business process departments and
manual investigatory procedures (where corrective fixes are applied, if
necessary). If the reconciliation process identified a difference between
the sources being compared, then manual steps are taken to establish
and correct the errors and potentially issue Transaction Corrections as

a remedy.

3.13. The reconciliation process ultimately presents the possibility of further
error within the Horizon system whereby an inappropriate method of fix
was selected, and/or the corrective fixes may have been carried out
erroneously.

3.14 Regarding Issue 6, it is agreed in the joint statement that, whilst
Horizon contains measures and controls for detecting system integrity
concerns, the automatic mechanisms have failed in the past.

3.15 There are a range of measures and controls existing in Horizon each
designed to prevent, detect, identify, report and reduce the risk of
several multifaceted errors. It is likely that during the life of Horizon
system that these measures and controls improved. It is also reasonably
likely that in the majority of cases the measures and controls were

successful. However, there is also evidence to indicate that a

180503R1935 16 October 2018 Page 15 of 225

cost/benefit analysis was applied to the fixing of bugs/errors/defects
and that the possibility of error was not reduced as far aspossible.

3.16 Regarding Issue 7, documentation illustrates that Fujitsu could remotely
access transaction data recorded by Horizon. Several technical tools
exist with the specific purpose of allowing Fujitsu to carry out
modifications and corrective fixes to transaction data. In addition, a
number of external audit reports commissioned by Post Office reported
that such access could occur without adherence to the control
mechanisms in place.

3.17 With respect to Issues 8 and 9, whilst there are reports available to the
Subpostmaster for accessing and identifying branch transactions
recorded within Horizon; these reports would not necessarily allow them
to identify any discrepancies/or shortfalls that arose from errors
occurring within the processing of data within the Horizon systems, or
of a discrepancy reported by an external client. The experts agree that
other causes of apparent or alleged discrepancies and shortfalls may be
more difficult or impossible to identify from reports or transaction data
available to Subpostmasters.

3.18 Many Known Error Logs (KELs) identify that not all errors were
understood even by Fujitsu. In the circumstances, it is highly unlikely
that a Subpostmaster could interpret or identify the causes of any
bugs/errors or defects when Fujistsu themselves often did not

understand the cause of such or their full effects.

3.19 Post Office have a significantly larger repository of information available
to them than the Subpostmaster. Post Office could request further lower
level detail of data from Fujitsu and would have visibility of reports
beyond the counter level that were not available to the Subpostmaster.

3.20 Further agreed in the Joint Statement, identification of errors would
require cooperation of Post Office staff because of a Subpostmasters’
limited knowledge of complex back-end systems.

3.21 In respect of Issue 10, documentation illustrates that a wide range of
users at Fujitsu did and do have the ability and facilities to access and
modify transaction data. Fujitsu staff were able to implement changes
that had the potential to affect transaction data both without the
knowledge or consent of the Subpostmaster and/or Post Office. In
addition, a number of external audits commissioned by Post Office
reported that the appropriate control mechanisms to prevent mistakes

being made were not always followed.

3.22 As agreed in the experts Joint Statement, the very nature of applying
fixes within any IT system, including those implemented by Fujitsu have
the potential to affect transaction data or data in branch accounts.

3.23. Regarding Issue 11, business process rules and technical restrictions
should apply in relation to accessing and modifying transaction data. It
is reported that a documented audit log of each and every occasion of
live data access exists, however, this has not been made available by
Post Office.

3.24 Regarding how often transaction data was accessed (Issue 12), I have
asked for this information by way of Request for Information, but at the
date of submitting my report Post Office has refused, making reference
to the relevancy of my request. Post Office states that there are more
than 36,000 documents regarding how often the access was granted
(outside of actions not needing express authorisation that could also be
carried out to fix data), but these have not been made available for

review.

3.25 Regarding Issue 13, the implications of Fujitsu carrying out corrective
fixes to data within the Horizon system is that it could have the potential
to affect the reliability of Branches’ accounting positions.

3.26 Issue 14 and how Subpostmasters fulfilled certain processes is detailed
at section 7.

3.27. Issue 15 and how Horizon processes and records Transaction
Corrections is set out in detail at Section 6.48 of this report. For a
Transaction Correction to be processed, the financial value of the
correction is manually assessed by Post Office staff, before submission
to the Subpostmaster via Horizon.

3.28 Transaction Corrections can be issued to either rectify an error or
discrepancy deemed as a fault by the Subpostmaster (or clerk), or when
branch transaction data does not align with Post Office, or a Post Office
external client which may not be an error on the Subpostmasters’ part.
It is also possible that Transaction Corrections were issued as a result
of error in Horizon transaction data processing.

subcontracted to Escher’®.

4.3 Horizon, initially based upon Escher’s Riposte messaging system (and
later supported by the WebRiposte system to accommodate Network
Banking changes and the Network Banking Engine supplied by IBM),
was subsequently migrated to Horizon Online. Horizon is therefore
ultimately a composition of many sub-contracted components.'!

EFTPoS - Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale.

4.5

4.6

4.7

Initial work was carried out in 1997 to specify a high-level design
approach for the support of EFTPoS within the Horizon platform’? The
purpose was to accommodate new functionality to allow debit and credit
cards as an additional method of payment (MoP) for Post Office goods
and services, directly within the Electronic Point of Sale System
(EPOSS).

The requirement to introduce a Network Banking Service took priority

over (and subsumed) this requirement.

Post Office Counters Ltd (POCL) objective became to add debit card
payments as an additional method of payment to the Horizon Network
whilst the Network Banking Service was being delivered (initially
20021)

The Introduction of the Network Banking Solution

4.8

4.9

After the failure to introduce the Payments Benefit Card in 1999 ,13 POCL
and Pathway signed an agreement to automate post offices, and Post
Offices Network Banking Unit (PONB) introduced the requirement to
fulfil banking transactions at Post Office counters so as to offer services

for several different banking institutions.

In summer 2000, a ‘proof of concept’ was undertaken to investigate the
integration of internet technologies with the current Horizon System to
support the delivery of banking transactions'* (and subsequently to
replace the loss of the benefits card system). A primary facet of the

Network Banking Solution was the delivery of the banking transactions

installation and integration of this was the task of ICL Pathway.

4.10 WebRiposte was a message passing technology from Escher Group
which extended the functionality of the existing Riposte Message
Server'4 (which was responsible for storing all the data in the Post Office
branches and replicating it to the Data Centres).

4.11 IBM were selected for the supply of the Network Banking Engine which
was designed to handle the interface between the Horizon system and
the agreed Financial Institutions, which Post Office referred to as

“External Clients’.

4.12 I The introduction of network banking and EFTPoS developments brought
with it a more complex enhanced architecture within which further
systems to ensure transaction integrity and reconciliation could be
imposed.

4.13 However, it should be considered that ‘Horizon’ originally stemmed from
an inherited system and architecture with an initial, fundamentally

different design requirement.

4.14 Early documentation identifies that around 1998 and during a period
where Pathway Performance Technical Testing was to be conducted by
A&TC (assessing the system from a technical angle of suitability), there
were so many design changes that the totality of the testing had to be
re-planned into four stages'®.

4.15 The aim of the testing and various other relied upon documents was for

Pathway to produce a report to meet Horizon acceptance requirements.
4.16 The document further states (in relation to the testing conducted):

“It was not practical to build a performance test rig to replicate the entire
system architecture. The tests were therefore carried out on sub-systems

consisting of system components designed to represent the live system
as resources permit. The system definition, however, has changed
significantly over the test period and tests may not have run on the
current hardware definition.”

4.17 I have not identified nor reviewed a Horizon Acceptance Report. Nor
have I seen the output of the early tests conducted in relation to the
Horizon system. However, it is apparent that the initial system design

and architecture was an evolved and evolving landscape.
Horizon Components

4.18 Horizon is a complex multifaceted system. Core components that
facilitate its operation (an understanding of which are necessary for this

report) are summarised below.
Reference Data

4.19 Reference Data (effectively data about products and operational
elements) is a critical element of the Horizon system, which interfaces
with a wide range of Horizon components. Without Reference Data,
Horizon would not fully function, nor could Subpostmasters operate
their branches. It informs the operation of the Point of Sale system at
the counter amongst many other things. The management and
operations with regard to Reference Data has been outsourced from

within Post Office control toa sub-contractor (ATOS) since June 2014.

4.20 The integrity of Reference Data is critical for the correct operation of a
variety of systems within the Horizon architecture. Post Office’s
Reference Data Management Centre (RDMC) supports the loading,
storage and release of Reference Data within the Horizon system. The
Reference Data Distribution Service (RDDS) distributes Reference Data
to Post Office branches and other data centre systems. The POL
Reference Data Team is a team dedicated to delivery of Reference Data
and verification of operational business change through Reference Data.

Horizon counter Reference Data was distributed by the Riposte

messaging facility, although this was replaced by a different mechanism
in Horizon Online.

Despite the criticality of the integrity of Reference Data, a document
from July 2017 suggests that changes to Reference Data were not
subject to any appropriate change control process. The document?”

reports; “... we have now aligned that all Reference Data changes go
through the appropriate change process”. This is consistent with the
position that prior to July 2017 Reference Data could be changed

without any formal consideration as to what the impactmight be.

Transaction Data

4.22

According to Fujitsu, there are only four sources of transactions that

make up transaction data!®:
a. Those manually entered by a user in branch at the counter;

b. Transaction Corrections (TC) which are produced by Post Office to
be accepted by a user in branch to correct discrepancies in the

accounts;

c. Transaction Acknowledgements (TA) which are non-counter
transactions and typically initiate from another piece of equipment
(such as a lottery terminal). These transactions are typically
relayed to Post Office/Fujitsu and need accepting into Horizon
before forming part of the branch’s transaction data;

d. Fujitsu inserted transactions. These are known as _ balancing
transactions and are injected into branch accounts by Fujitsu in
order to ‘balance’ a discrepancy. These do NOT require acceptance

by the Subpostmaster as TC’s and TA’s do.

The Horizon Counter (1996 - 2010)

4.23

4.24

4.25

4.26

4.27

The processing of the Horizon counter detailed below has been taken

from the Witness Statement of Gareth Jenkins dated October 2012.*°

Horizon was initially designed to store all data locally on the branch
counter’s hard disk (see Appendix B Figure 1).

Once the data has been successfully stored there it is then replicated
(copied) to the hard disks of any other counters in the branch (or in the
instance of a single counter branch stored to additional external storage
on the counter). It is then passed on from the counter to the Horizon
data centre where it is stored in the CS messagestore.

The replication process was designed so that if the data was not copied
immediately (because of communications or hardware failure), then
further attempts are made to replicate the data at regular intervals until

it is finally copied successfully.

Once the data reaches the Horizon data centre a further copy is taken
by the Audit Agent which writes it to an audit file where it is available
for retrieval for up to seven years.

Transaction Auditability

4.28

4.29

Data in the audit trail was designed to be sealed with a secure checksum
that is held separately to ensure that transaction data has not been
tampered with or corrupted.

Horizon was designed so that every record written to the Transaction
Log at the counter should have its own unique incrementing sequence
number. Therefore, it should be possible to detect if any transaction
records become anomalous (where they are actually captured by the
Transaction Log in the first instance) .

4.30 Whilst a customer session was in progress, details of the transactions
for that customer session were normally held in the computer’s memory
until the customer session (referred to as the ‘stack’) was settled. At
that point all details of the transactions were written to the local hard
disk and replicated. When a stack was secured it was written in such a
way that either all the data is written to the local hard disk or none of it

is written.

4.31 The data for the stack will have been successfully secured to the local
hard disk before the screen updated indicating that a new customer
session can be started.

4.32 Although an attempt will have been made to replicate the data to the
messagestore, there is no guarantee at this point that such replication
will have been successful. For example, if there is a network failure
followed by a terminal failure there is a risk that transactions in the

intervening period could be lost.

4.33 Any failures to write to the hard disk after appropriate retries would

result in the counter ‘failing’ and needing to be restarted.

4.34 Whenever data is retrieved for audit enquiries several checks should be

carried out, namely that:

a. The audit files have not been tampered with and their Journal
Sequence Number (JSN) is incremental to the last one;

b. The individual transactions have their integrity checked to ensure

that no corruption has occurred;

c. Acheck should be made that no records are missing. Each record
generated by a counter has an incremental sequence number and

a check is made that there are no gaps in the sequencing.
Migration towards Horizon Online (Horizon Online 2010 - Present)

4.35 A document dated 2005 authored by Fujitsu records the requirement
for Fujitsu to provide a more competitive solution, since Fujitsu

accounted for 65% of the IT spending for Post Office”? The document
further notes:

“The original business case for HNG within Post Office was based on a
balance of cost reductions and improved capabilities. The new business
case is almost entirely based on cost reductions.”

4.36 Therefore, the major requirement for Horizon Online was to make
secure minimum changes to the legacy host systems whilst still
providing the end to end business needs?! Cost reductions in the
Horizon Online solution were to derive from (1) reusing legacy counter
hardware, (2) revised test and disaster resilience strategy, (3)
application re-engineering, (4) revised development processes, and (5)
utilising offshore programmers for software development.?°

4.37 Horizon hardware was recycled for continued use in Horizon Online,
there was an acknowledgement in a Board Report”? regarding design

considerations when implementing Horizon Online:

“While the architecture is generally designed for resilience, cost/risk
trade-offs were agreed in the move from the original Horizon system to
the new HNG-X one which mean that the service is not truly high
availability”.

4.38 Since analysis of serviceability issues within Horizon identified that the
two key areas of cost were (1) the stability and manageability of the
Riposte application and (2) the effort in recovering data stored locally
on counters, the Horizon Online objective was therefore to redevelop
the business applications and enforce a centralised model for data
storage.2° The counter hardware would remain and locally store

operational data (e.g., Reference Data) and business logic, but the

transactional data would be stored in the data centre rather than on the
branch counters.°

4.39 In order to further reduce the overall application development costs
within Horizon Online, substantial re-use of data centre application
components was proposed. The legacy host database applications (TPS,
APS, LFS, DRS and TES) were to remain largely intact, and a web service
interface was to replace Riposte messaging, and simplification of
security mechanisms.?>

4.40 The diagrams of data centre applications and Horizon / Horizon Online
migration shown in Appendix B (Figure 2 & Figure 3) illustrate the
changed components of Horizon to accommodate Horizon Online and

legacy components remaining, and the changes at branch counter level.
The Branch Database

4.41 Horizon Online brought significant changes to the counter processing as

described above.

4.42 For Horizon Online, all data is now stored in an online branch database
known as the BRDB (therefore, no longer stored on the counter hard
drive).

4.43 Transactions are carried out locally on the Horizon Online counters and
a ‘Basket’ is built up during a customer session. Each transactionshould

result in a Basket entry consisting of one or more accounting lines.

4.44 At the end of a customer session when the Basket has been completed
and all settlement items (or tender lines) have been processed and
added into the Basket as further accounting lines (in double entry
terms), such that the total value of the Basket is zero, the entire Basket
is sent to the data centre as a BAL message where the Branch Access
Layer (BAL) processes the message and all the accounting lines are

recorded and committed to the BRDB.** Horizon Online message flows
are depicted in in Appendix B (Figure 4).

4.45 The BRDB is the repository for all branch transactions and event data
captured. It also provides the storage mechanism for other branch data

such as Transaction Corrections.

4.46 Transactional data is written to the branch database (BRDB) via the
Branch Communication Application on the Branch Application Servers.
Logic in the branch communication application should then be able to
discern between the different transaction typesby passing over the data
stream and inserting the data into the relevant BRDB tables. The largest
single function performed by the branch communication application is
the capture of transaction and settlement information resulting from
completion of customer sessions and other activities within the branch
estate. The data needs to therefore be scanned to determine its type

before it is acted upon.?>

4.47, The branch communication application will then be responsible for
inserting transaction data directly into the ‘Main Transaction Store’
within the BRDB. The main transaction store then facilitates delivery of
appropriate data to Post Office Account external interfaces via the
legacy applications (See Reconciliation in Horizon Online Diagram

Appendix B - Figure 6).
Report Data

4.48 The branch communication application is responsible for inserting a
subset of transaction data directly into a Report Data Store (within the
BRDB) that is designed specifically to facilitate counter/branch
daily/weekly reporting.?>

Aggregated Data

4.49 Daily batch processes are responsible for aggregation of data from the
main transaction store. This is stored as aggregated data that should
facilitate calculation of the stock units and branch totals for declarations
and the information required for the rollover processes (transitioning
from one accounting period to the next). Declaration totals will also be
stored in this area.

Recovery Data

4.50 The recovery data store in the BRDB is used to capture events that need
to be recorded in case of errors mid transaction, to define the
appropriate behaviour of the counter on recovery.

Audit Data

4.51 A separate audit record of transactions and events is maintained that
contains the raw data received in the message from the counter. I
understand that this was archived.

Transaction Auditability

4.52 Horizon was designed so that auditable messages from the counter were
stored, together with their digital signature and other key attributes in
the ‘Audit table’ (also known as the Message Journal) in the BRDB. Each
day the contents of this database tableshould be copied from the BRDB
to a number of serial files. A check should be made that there was no
missing or duplicate Journal Sequencing Numbers (JSNs) for any
counter.

4.53 The files are then copied to the audit system where they are sealed
digitally and held for seven years during which time they may be
retrieved and filtered to produce the relevant audit for a particular

branch.?°

Legacy Horizon / Horizon Online Counter Processes

4.54 Whilst many core counter processes remained largely the same,
technical processing of certain counter activities changed through the

introduction of Horizon Online.

Recovery

4.55 Disconnections and screen freezes for Horizon Online are recorded as
being dealt with differently to Horizon (preHorizon Online).?”

4.56 Subpostmasters are informed through the above quick reference guide
to ensure they “do the right thing at the time the counter becomes

unavailable.”

4.57 Therefore, where a connection to the data centre is lost, users are
presented with a ‘Retry Communication’ message displayed on screen.
Users are encouraged to select the ‘Retry’ option a maximum of two

times to see if data centre connectivity has been restored.

4.58 The Recovery process is stated as one of the procedures to ensure data

integrity remains in the event of a failure.

4.59 In the event the data centre connection is not re-established from the
retry action, the system should settle the session automatically printing
three copies of a Disconnected Session receipt (unless there is a
hardware failure and/or system freeze). Where a connection to the data
centre has been lost before a Basket has been settled the system treats
the transactions as either:

a. Recoverable

b. Non-Recoverable”®

Reversals

4.61 Horizon Reversals are transactions that are effectively ‘undone’ either
initiated by a Subpostmaster or electronically through the system?°.

4.62 If a transaction has been entered and the customer sessi on completed,
the transaction can be reversed (for example, if the transaction has
been entered incorrectly, or if a customer requests a refund).

4.63 Reversals are also initiated following system failures. These are
documented later in this report as there is evidence that reversals were
problematic in Horizon and affected branch accounts".

4.64 Areversal does not result in transaction information in the journal being
amended but causes the insertion of additional, compensating and
correcting transactions .*°

incidents either by directly interacting with the user (typically the

Subpostmaster) or from monitoring systems. They document incident

symptoms and aim to resolve all issues where the cause is user training

or environment. ist line resolve incidents by the identification of

knowledge base entries and the application of defined scripts. A new

incident is raised for each critical event that is not already dowmented

and passed to 2nd line support teams for action.

Support Services Provision in 2001

4.72 In 2001, 1st line support to the Horizon system users was provided by
the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH), run by the Operational Services
Division (OSD) of ICL.

4.73 2nd line support was provided by System Management Centre (SMC),
also run by OSD.

4.74 3rd line support was provided by the Software Support Centre (SSC).

4.75 4th line support was provided by a combination of Pathway
Development, Escher, OSD and Eicon.

Support Services Provision in 2010

4.76 By 2010, HSH had been renamed to the Horizon Support Desk (HSD)

and was run by Fujitsu.

4.77. SMC had become more of a 1st line support unit and there was no
dedicated 2nd line support unit. Instead, the 2nd line responsibilities
were being fulfilled between the 1st line and 3rd line units providing a

“virtual” 2nd line function.
4.78 SSC continued to provide 3rd line support.

4.79 4th line support had been streamlined to the Fujitsu Application Support
Service (ASA). ASA would then liaise with Fujitsu Services’
subcontractors/suppliers, or Post Office's suppliers as appropriate.

Support Services Provision from 2014

calls were transferred back to second line support using the same

mechanism.

By 2010, the 1st and 2nd line support Powerhelp system had been
replaced by a system called Triole for Service (TfS) to record incidents
and PinICL had been replaced by PEAK, an in-house developed Fujitsu
services incident and release management system.*> An individual

incident so recorded is referred to as a PEAK.

OTI was still used to link the TfS and PEAK systems, although TfS has a
limit of 4000 characters within a single update which potentially
exposed a loss in information.

From 2014, all 1st line tickets were logged into Atos’ SDM12 service
desk application and if not resolved on first call, were transferred to a
2nd line (or higher) team within Fujitsu. This transfer was provided by
an automated interface into Fujitsu’s Triole for Service (TFS) tool*®

Known Error Logs (KELs)

4.87

The principle of the KEL has been used since 2001 to record information
and workarounds for known issues. This has evolved into a database
maintained by SSC that is available to all levels of support.

available workarounds before passing incidents on to 2nd line support.
Where no KEL is found, 2nd line support create a new KEL to record a
workaround or as part of raising a new incident on the PEAK system for
3rd line support to investigate.

4.89 Information on the KEL is updated by all levels of support as work to
resolve the incident progresses. Any creation or update of a KEL must
be authorised by SSC before it can be seen by all users.

4.90 All new PEAK incidents should be accompanied by a KEL.

4.91 It is possible for a KEL to be linked to multiple PEAK incidents and for a
PEAK incident to reference multiple KELs.

Release Management
4.92 There are three types of release :*”

a. Major Releases - these will normally be to deliver significant new
functionality

b. Emergency fixes —- implemented as required to resolve operational
bugs/errors and defect issues

c. Maintenance Releases - applied frequently to address minor
bugs/errors/defects or security issues and the mechanism by

which Fault PEAKs are usually resolved.

Fault PEAK Lifecycle38

4.93 The basic Fault PEAK Lifecycle is as follows:
i. Open - Initial state of a PEAK call
ii. Pending - Incident is being investigated

iii. Final - Investigations have finished -Final response is sent back

for approval
iv. Closed - Final state - call is closed on the PEAK system.

4.94 If a PEAK has been sent to a team it is that team’s responsibility to
monitor it, send it on for investigation, fix it or release it to the correct
PEAK stack (queue).

Assignment of PEAK Incidents to Maintenance Releases

4.95 Fault PEAKs are investigated and if a fix is required it is sent with an
assessment of the time to fix and any issues to the PEAK stack for the
Business Impact Forum (BIF).*° The BIF convenes weekly to review

outstanding PEAKs for consideration of the business impact.

4.96 If the BIF decide that a fix is not warranted for cost or other reasons,
the Known Error Log (KEL) is updated and the PEAK is closed.

4.97 If the BIF decide that the PEAK should be fixed it is submitted to the
PEAK stack for the PEAK Targeting Forum (PTF).

4.98 The PTF convenes weekly and considers new Fault PEAKs and PEAKs
that have previously been deferred, as well as PEAKs which introduce
business change associated with approved Change Proposals. These
PEAKs will be targeted to a specific maintenance release*° taking into

account timing, other development activities and a@sociated factors.

4.99 The PEAK is then sent back to Development to deliver the fix for
incorporation into the maintenance release.

5. Horizon Bugs/Errors Defects and Controls

Issue 1 - To what extent was it possible or likely for bugs, errors or defects of
the nature alleged at §§23 and 24 of the GPOC and referred to in §§ 49 to 56
of the Generic Defence to have the potential to (a) cause apparent or alleged
discrepancies or shortfalls relating to Subpostmasters’ branch accounts or
transactions, or (b) undermine the reliability of Horizon accurately to process
and to record transactions as alleged at §24.1 GPOC?

Issue 3 - To what extent and in what respects is the Horizon System “robust”

and extremely unlikely to be the cause of shortfalls in branches?

Issue 4 - To what extent has there been potential for errors in data recorded
within Horizon to arise in (a) data entry, (b) transfer or (c) processing of data

in Horizon?

Issue 6 - To what extent did measures and/or controls that existed in Horizon
prevent, detect, identify, report or reduce to an extremely low level the risk of

the following:
a. data entry errors;

b. data packet or system level errors (including data processing,
effecting, and recording the same);

c. a failure to detect, correct and remedy software coding errors or
bugs;

d. errors in the transmission, replication and storage of transaction
record data; and

e. the data stored in the central data centre not being an accurate

record of transactions entered on branch terminals?

5.1 There are several areas where Bugs, Errors and Defects could occur.
Some of these are set out below:

a. Failure of a software component (counter software, Horizon data

centre components)

b. Error in Reference Data

c. Failure of a hardware component at counter (CPU, PIN pad, touch

screen, keyboard, counter scanners, network router)

d. Failure of a hardware component at PO data centre (Database
servers, communication servers)

e. Errors in various communications which need to take place for

Horizon to function:
i. Transfer between counter and PIN pad,
ii. Transfer between counter and Branch Database (BRDB),

iii. Transfer between Branch Database and Post Office back end

systems,

iv. Transfer between Authorisation Agent and Post Offices External
Clients.

f. Those areas as set out in Section 5 ‘Horizon Robustness’ and
Section 6 ‘Reconciliation’.

5.2 As agreed in the Joint Statement of experts, evidence exists that
bugs/errors/defects have caused actual discrepancies and/or shortfalls
relating to Subpostmaster branch accounts.

5.3 Identified common failure points throughout Horizon are demonstrated
at Appendix H. This list is not exhaustive but is based on the review of
evidence undertaken to date.

Known Errors/Bugs Defects acknowledged by Post Office

5.4 It should be noted that there are several known bugs/errors/defects
previously acknowledged by Post Office that have affected branch
accounts. These are known as the “Payments Mismatch” defect,

“Calendar Square / Falkirk” bug, and the “Suspense Account bug”.*?

Calendar Square / Falkirk Issue‘!

5.5 This defect was discovered in 2005 and fixed in March 2006 and

involved Horizon failing to recognise transfers between different stock

units. In summary, stock units receiving transfers could not “see” them,

resulting in branch account discrepancies.

Payments Mismatch

5.6 This bug affected at least 62 branches and related to the process of

moving discrepancies into the local suspense account. The majority of

incidents are recorded as occurring between August and October 2010.

5.7 The bug was documented in a report from Gareth Jenkins 29 September

2010? where it was stated:

“This has the following consequences: There will be a receipts and

payment mismatch corresponding to the value of discrepancies that were

lost. Note that if the user doesn't check their final balance report carefully

they may be unaware of the issue since there is no explicit message when

a receipts and payment mismatch is found on the final balance (the user
is only prompted when one is just detected during a trial balance)”

5.8 This issue is reported as causing discrepancies showing at the Horizon

counter which disappeared when branches followed certain process

steps. However, these discrepancies still appeared within the back-end

branch account. It is noted that the issue occurred if a branchcancelled

the completion of the trading period and then, within the same session,

continued to roll into a new balance period.

5.9 PEAK PC0204765* is a “Master PEAK” that records branches which were

thought that have been affected.

5.10 KEL wrightm33145J* identifies the workaround but also states:

“Unfortunately the workaround cannot be done after the problem has
occurred at the office! In this case the branch accounts need to be
corrected.”

5.11 It is not clear how many corrections were required to fix all instances of
this (or even that all instances were indeed fixed) or when a full audit

was completed.4?

Suspense Account Bug

5.12 The suspense account bug caused Horizon to erroneously replicate
suspense account items. It appears that the bug caused Horizon to use
2010 monthly Branch trading figures for 2011 and 2012.

5.13 It is reported that POL later investigated and identified the same bug as
being the cause of the issue in January 20134 suggesting that the bug
may have been resident within Horizon foran extended period.

5.14 POL-0215998*° lists the 14 affected branches identified in the

occurrence of the bug in 2013.
Further Bugs / Errors / Defects not acknowledged by Post Office

5.15 The following errors are observed to have occurred within the Horizon
system, however they do not appear to have not been acknowledged as

system wide issues by POL in the same manner as those listed above.

Dalmellington

5.16 This defect relates to the example that occurred specifically in 2015 at
the Dalmellington Branch in which a Subpostmistress performed a cash
remittance from a core branch to an outreach branch.*° The acceptance
at the outreach branch resulted in quadruple remittance transactions”
resulting in a £24,000 discrepancy.

5.17. It is reported in the email thread between Atos and a Helen Baker of
CWU that the remittance team in Chesterfield were aware of the fault
(as this is noted as occurring a “couple of years ago”) and that
Transaction Corrections could be issued for the ‘extra’ remittances.

5.18 The email thread further states (by Atos) that the root cause was
identified as the user forcing log off when post log in checks had not
fully completed and it was therefore considered as a process issue and
not a technical one. However, this is not consistent with the event logs
that do not indicate it was as a result of forced log off.

5.19 Further, Atos refer to release of "a code change that will avoid further
instances of this across the estate”to be included within Release 13.05
to be deployed in March 2016 (five months after the incident). The fact
that Atos made a change to the Horizon system to prevent re-

occurrence is therefore consistent with this being a software bug.

Cash Declarations - Cash Management

5.20 I have identified several Known Error Logs (KELs) that document
occurrences of varying forms of cash declaration discrepancies having
the ability to affect branch accounts reportedly due to system problems.

5.21 KEL acha1233J* - Discrepancies between branch cash declarations and
the amount received by the cash management system (SAP) were
identified. In the data communication channel between Horizon and the
cash management system, an incorrect adjustment was being made
which added together the “branch cash in pouches overnight” figure to
what the branch has actually declared. The KEL states this is not a user
error or anything that can be corrected at branch level. This is therefore

consistent with the problem being due to the existence of software bug.

5.22 KEL achai717T*® - Whilst possible causes and a suggested process for
investigation of this issue by the support team is highlighted, there is
nevertheless an acknowledgement that there is the possibility that cash
declaration discrepancies could be due to an “Unknown system
problem”. It is worth noting what the Horizon support team consider a

discrepancy in this instance as:

“A discrepancy is the difference between the cash system thinks the
branch should have, based on a previous balanced figure and the
transactions recorded since, and the cash declared by the branch”.

5.23 There is also evidence of cash declaration discrepancies arising from
clerks duplicating remittance in transactions (“Rem-in”) because of
wrong messages being presented on the Horizon counter screen
(acha621P°°). This would result in incorrect cash amounts being
declared. This is again likely due to a bug because a software fix was
applied on 12 January 2016. However, this was not a retrospective fix
and therefore any similar, previous discrepancies were not remedied. It
is unknown how many other Post Office branches were affected or if any
communication was sent out by the Post Office to other branches to

prevent further occurrences prior to the fix being applied.

5.24 KEL LKiang3014S*! reports an issue with how the Horizon system
behaves when a Subpostmaster makes multiple cash declarations and
then runs a trial balance report. The calculation displayed for the
resulting trial balance was incorrect. The support department was
unable to identify the root cause of the discrepancy although it was
reported that a correction could be made at the Post Office counter level

by redoing the cash declaration using the same amount already

declared. The KEL remains unresolved and is also cross referenced by
Fujitsu with MScardifield2219S°*, which identifies the underlying
software bug being caused by “cached data” not being updated via
Riposte. This resulted in incorrect data being presented in any
discrepancy, variance and balance reports. It is reported that the
problem should clear itself overnight and/or a manual workaround was
possible. In either case this scenario is in my opinion likely to be
confusing for the Subpostmaster and could lead to them making
modifications which are unnecessary if they are unaware that the
problem should clear itself overnight It was stated in November 2007
that a fix was being piloted with a view to it being released in January

2008 but it is unknown if this took place and/or was successful.

5.25 Errors within cash pouch delivery could have also affected branch
accounts. In DSeddon5426P® a failure in pouch delivery resulted in a
cash gain when the Subpostmaster carried out a branch cash
declaration.

5.26 In achai94L™ a problem affecting around 15% of kiosk branches
prevented these branches from being able to automatically make cash
declarations. The message being presented (Code: 2303 - Incorrect
Transaction Amount) was misleading since the totals were in fact correct
and the transaction amount checks were failing due to incorrect data
types. A bug fix was proposed for the second half of 2015, but it is
unknown if this took place and what further communications went out

to affected branches.

5.27. Iam also aware from the witness statement of Pam Stubbs °° prepared
for the Common Issues trial that other potential problems with kiosk
operations could have potentially affected branch accounts.

Bureau & Decimal Point Issue

5.28 Post Office has disclosed a PEAK which highlights a fault with bureau
transactions where an omitted decimal point in the “euro” line caused a
discrepancy. In this particular PEAK®® the Subpostmaster declared
€57,865.00 (expressed as “euro 5786500”), but the sterling equivalent
was £0.00 (expressed as “0.00”). When the Subpostmaster tried to
reverse the transaction, the figure doubled. It was noted in the call log
this problem had been seen on a couple of other occasions and caused
significant accounting problems. It was due to be fixed as part of the

S80 release.
5.29 A detailed PEAK log is available at Appendix A.
Reference Data Errors

5.30 Reference Data is changed frequently within Horizon, I understand at
least once per day. Post Office reported that until 2017°’ the process of
changing Reference Data was conducted without being subject to formal
controls. Evidence suggests that Reference Data has been found to be
incorrect within Horizon and that this led to discrepancies within branch
accounts. Within the document, ‘Counter Type X Reference Data
Definitions”®®, it is explained that “Counter Type Reference data... will
usually only change on the back of a Change Proposal or Live PEAK fix”.
Examples have been found in KEL/PEAK records of Reference Data
having an impact upon daily counter activities (DSeddon314Q*). These

vary in severity and these errors are passed to the data reference team
for rectification.

Supporting Documentation

5.31 Errors in Reference Data and/or Reference Data validation has affected
counter activities in several different ways. By way of an example in
johnbascoG5222H® an Automated Payment transaction was reported
as having failed due to “Unknown Agent Code 3046”. Client account
code 3046 was found to not exist in Reference Data and the fault was
not reproducible when the problem was analysed and tested. It was
acknowledged that, due to the business impact, a fix would be provided
to check and validate the client account code exists in Reference Data

before the transaction is committed.

5.32 KEL acha10L® documents how branches were unable to accept cards
for rent and council tax payments due to incorrect Reference Data,
although in this circumstance no impact on the branch accounts in terms
of discrepancies would occur as the cards were just rejected completely.

5.33. KEL MWrighti458Q® illustrates where withdrawn products (with
withdrawn Reference Data) can affect a branch accounting position
because the Subpostmaster will have products that cannot be accounted
for as there is no remaining reference for them to later declare that
stock item in the accounts.

5.34 Identified in KEL wbra5353J®, the customer was charged twice for the
same transaction which was reported to be a side effect of errors within

Reference Data.

Duplicate Transactions

5.35

5.36

5.37

There is evidence of duplicate transactions existing within Horizon due

to incorrect processing.

The error appears to have occurred when payment data was being
harvested prior to being transmitted to an external client. The
harvesting process should have identified duplicate transactions and
dealt with these appropriately. However, any disruption in service can

cause the harvesting process to send duplicate payment transactions.

This would result in a discrepancy between POL and the external client
where client summary payment files were submitted to an external
client prior to the duplication issue being noticed.

Supporting Documentation

5.38

GMaxwell3651K® and surs357P°> both demonstrate that any failures or
interruptions in service with the harvesting process can cause
duplicated payment transactions to be processed. In the latter case
Streamline, the external third party, received a payment file with 835
duplicate payment transactions totalling £76,564.53. In this instance
Streamline identified the duplicates and prevented payment processing.
However, identification occurred after the transaction data had been
transmitted from Horizon and despite any processes designed to
prevent this.

Failed Recoveries

5.39

The recovery process is outlined at section 4.54 above and the
importance of this and the error scenarios where recovery might apply

mitigate against this a failed recovery report exists to set out any
instances where this has occurred.

5.40 The witness statement of Angela Burke®” documents a recovery process
failure within Horizon. Communication issues within Horizon resulted in
a transaction that authorised and processed at the counter failing to
recover within the Branch’s accounts. This subsequently resulted in a
discrepancy that Mrs Burke had to seek to reclaim from Post Office in

order to balance the discrepancy.

5.41 The Horizon KEL jharr832S® acknowledges that the recovery process is

a complex area:

“Clerk needs to follow POL business rules properly. It is a complex area
and various factors can affect whether recovery happens or not
depending on exactly when it crashes and what the clerk replies”.

5.42 KEL cardc464Q® reports the difficulty the clerk may have faced when
trying to process recoverable transactions. In this case, recovery was
attempted but failed. Whilst the recoverable transaction appeared on
the failed recovery report, it is now out of the hands of the
Subpostmaster. In this instance recovery failure had no impact on
branch or customer accounts as settlement had not written to the BRDB.
Had recovery run successfully, a zero-value transaction would have
been written to the database which should not affect branch accounts

as it is simply a record entry with zero financial value

5.43 KELs seng2037L & acha959T’°”! describe how various transactions
states may also indicate a failed recovery or an incomplete transaction

awaiting recovery.

5.44 dsed4733R” provides an example where transaction recovery failed due
to a wrongly named recovery script. This was a Horizon system error
arising because of incorrect Reference Data that had to be corrected by
the Reference Data team. It is unknown when this was corrected but,
in the meantime, SSC would need to have cleared the failed recoveries

daily.

5.45 There appears to be a high risk of failed recoveries arising because of a
failure to follow correct procedures or lack of understanding of the
recovery process. The failed recovery report should pick up these
recoverable transactions but by this point it is no longer something that

can be resolved at the counter.

5.46 There are a number of PEAKs”? PC0203676, PC0263451, PC0266575 &
PC0273046 (detailed PEAK logs available in Appendix A) which identify
recurring failed communications issues subsequently resulting in failed
recoveries and consequently branch discrepancies. In these situations,
manual reconciliation was required, and Fujitsu needed to clear the

failed recovery transaction.
Failed Reversals

5.47 Reversals are set out in Section 4.61. In summary, they are the

‘undoing’ of transactions to reverse the value of it.

5.48 Whilst there is evidence of failures in respect of the electronic processing
of reversals (discussed in Section 4 above), it is observed that there
were also issues with interpretation and identification of system
reversals.

5.49 The document (“Helen Rose report”)”* refers to an incident where a
Transaction Correction was issued which the Subpostmaster duly settled
financially despite the Subpostmaster denying conducting the reversal.

5.50 The report appears to show that the material that Post Office initially
reviewed did not identify that it was the system that initiated the
reversal rather than the Subpostmaster and therefore the Transaction
Correction making the Subpostmaster liable was issued in error. Since
this is effectively a failure to appropriately reduce the risk of error this
is also dealt with further at Section 5.167.

Supporting Documentation

5.51 There is evidence that there were software issues resulting in Horizon
applying the wrong mathematical sign when reversing transactions
(i.e., a plus (+) rather than a minus (-)). This was identified in
PSteed2847N’>. In this instance, the issue resulted in the doubling of a
remittance value in transactions that should have been reversed,
effectively to zero. It is unclear when this software bug was fixed or how
widespread the problem was.

5.52 KEL cardc5756N’° provides an example where the system failed to
reverse all items in a multi-line pouch and only the first item was
reversed. It was reported that the clerk had appeared to have followed
the correct process, but the problem could not be reproduced on a tet

counter. A Transaction Correction was required to reverse the remaining

further examples of this were reported.

Uncategorised Bugs/Errors/Defects

5.53 There are various KELs and PEAKs relative to errors that have not been
categorised as those above. Similarly, no cause or resolution is
identified within the KEL to assist with further determination.

Supporting Documentation

5.54 Foreign currency discrepancies were noted in GCSimpson1049L.”7 All
currencies on hand doubled up following successful balancing eight days
previously. The KEL record stated the issue as being “under
investigation” but there is no detail of the results of any analysis.

5.55 There is evidence that in certain investigations there was insufficient
diagnostic data to be able to fully diagnose an issue. In KEL
MHarvey35271’8 an apparent successful transaction failed to be
validated due to a change of mode. It was reported that the change of
mode that had occurred could not be explained as the APS code would
not allow this and there was no other way to diagnose the issue. The
associated PEAK (PC113202) was closed as no further progress could
be made and it was treated as a “one off”.

5.56 In CObeng1123Q”? unexplained discrepancies (gains) for different stock
unit types (Cash and Stamps) was reported. Horizon system memory
faults appear to be the suspected cause in this case, but no suitable
alternative causes or factors were analysed, and the incident remained
unexplained. No advice is detailed to have been provided to the

Subpostmaster.

5.57. There are a number of PEAK records (i.e., PC0063723 & PC0084116*°)
which were believed to be system related bugs causing discrepancy
transactions to be calculated twice. The examples highlighted both refer
to KEL DRowe1625K which (according to the log in PC0084116) was
never properly resolved. It is also worth noting that there are many
more PEAK records associated with this KEL and the examples
highlighted span a period from March 2001 to November 2002. This
appears to be an issue that has never been fully resolved despite having
been passed to development to analyse further. There appears to have
been a workaround put in place, but it is not known how the workaround
was communicated and if or when the underlying cause was ever

resolved. A detailed PEAK log is available at Appendix A.

5.58 Similarly, in PEAK PC0027887* a known but unresolved software error
caused a doubling up of values in cash account periods. It is not clear
from the call logs how Fujitsu resolved the branch discrepancies and the
PEAK was closed after 12 months with the following comment:

“Closing call on basis of insufficient evidence. As this is such an old call I
have not contacted the call originator. I suggest that this call remains
closed!”

5.59 In PEAK PC0203131* differences between volumes and values in a
branch office snapshot was identified as a bug in Horizon carried forward
to Horizon Online. Since this was a pre-migration bug (as acknowledged
by Gareth Jenkins) the PEAK was closed. It may be that this issue was
resolved in Horizon Online but this cannot be confirmed on the existing

evidence.

Hardware Errors

5.60

5.61

5.62

5.63

Throughout the lifespan of Horizon, it is observed (particularly through
Second Sight reporting commissioned by Post Office®?) that counter
equipment was unreliable. This observation was reinforced in a Post
Office IT risk register document® which identified branch IT hardware

as being very old and requiring urgent replacement .
The issues are broadly categorised as:
i. Printer failures

ii. Screen misalignment (pressing one on screen button but
resulting in the system selecting a differentfunction)

iii. Failed communications links

A detailed self-help manual®> for troubleshooting and replacing
peripheral hardware equipment (keyboard, printer, monitor and PinPad)
appeared to be available for Subpostmasters. However it is not known
how widely this was distributed to Subpostmsaters and how often it was

updated.

A Spot Review report®® conducted by Second Sight Support Services
Limited gives further credence to the possibility that hardware issues
could have been responsible for branch discrepancies (shortages and
surpluses). In the example highlighted in the report, following a sudden
spike in branch discrepancies the Subpostmaster implemented rigorous
control improvements including performing twice daily balances and
installation and review of CCTV and CCTV film. Despite this, no root

cause was ever identified and there was no evidence that POL had

conducted any root cause analysis. The Subpostmaster had suspected
that faulty Horizon equipment could be the cause, but no firm evidence
was ever provided. The Subpostmaster had asked for replacement of
old hardware, but this had been refused by Post Office. Subsequently
the branch was flooded, and hardware was replaced due to flood
damage. Following the hardware replacement and the reopening of the
branch with the same staff and processes no further shortages occurred
and all transactions balanced. If this evidence is correct, it would be
consistent with the Subpostmaster’s view that suspect faulty hardware

was responsible for causing his shortages.

5.64 Second Sight also considered hardware issues in their report®” and were
unable to draw a firm conclusion on whether faulty equipment could be
responsible for otherwise unidentified branch shortages, but they also
recognised this could be a possibility. I have noted that hardware
replacement often seemed to be a “fix” of last resort where no other
explanation could be given, and therefore there is certainly a possibility

that hardware was at fault.®°

5.65 Problems relating to the condition of the electrical power supply to the
branches has been acknowledged by Post Office, for example an internal
Post Office email POL-0030971 reports:

“..was too scared to accept a cup of tea in case the Horizon system
crashed cos [sic] the electric supply is still a live (excuse the pun) issue...
It is Horizon related - the problems have only arisen since install & the
postmistress is now barking & rightly so in my view’.

5.66 Further documentation also uncovers issues in respect of PIN pads and

base unit failures. In addition, unexplained system behaviour related to

branch hardware was also reported®®? and which lead to payments
crediting the wrong accounts. By a process of elimination conducted by
the Subpostmaster, this was narrowed down to a single branch terminal
card reader. The Romec engineer who subsequently visited advised this
was a “known Horizon error” and the card reader needed to be re-
booted. It is not known how widespread this issue was and how many
transactions were affected and/or when the underlying cause of this

error was fixed.

5.67 POL-0032853°% (authored in 2004) sets out the “/essons /Jearnt” in
respect of the entire lifecycle of the S60 (software) release of which
there are many hardware related issues. In particular, ID No 36
documents an “Epson Printer Issue” resulted in Subpostmasters being
unable to declare their cash accounts.

5.68 There is a recurring theme relating to errors arising from PIN pad
failures. A selection of these can be seen in the following KELs
dsed525Q91, surs3941P92 and BrailsfordS239K93. In each case there
was a failure in the Subpostmasters being able to transact various types
of transactions including payment transactions using a PIN pad. An error
message and code were generated, and a new PIN pad was the
recommended solution.

5.69 cardc219R™ appears to indicate that any PIN pad related issues would
usually result in the recommendation of a new PIN pad whatever the
error. In this case a transaction had been declined by the PIN pad but
did not get reversed. An older version PIN Pad (Hypercom) was being

case when or if a new PIN pad was issued and if this fully resolved the
issue. In this instance there could be an impact on branch accounts if
no reversal takes place and reliance then shifts to reconciliation reports

to pick up these discrepancies.

There are variety of other examples of counter hardware issues®> where
replacement equipment was the recommended solution. Hardware
(keyboard, screen & screen cable) replacement was also suggested as
a solution for an issue with “phantom” sales lines appearing on the

“Fujitsu Services have applied adjustments to base unit data to account
for known problems within the Horizon System Infrastructure, which have
caused spurious fluctuations which should be ignored for the purpose of
forecasting the annual change. During the distribution of release CSR+

Fujitsu Closed Problem Records

5.75 Post Office has disclosed a contemporaneous spreadsheet entitled
“Copy of Fujitsu closed problem records.xls”®® which sets out around 200
issues which have been closed by Fujitsuin one year comprising of both
hardware and software issues. For example:

a. Issue ID 19 in the spreadsheet states in relation to a reconciliation

issue:

“Issues with First rate control files provided by Fujitsu. First Rate Travel

Service (Third Party) reconciles all Bureau de Change Transactions and
are currently unable to reconcile reversals against original transactions

due to this issue. The issue currently is caused by HNG-X Bureau de
Change Transactions transferred from Branch Database to TPS host.”

b. Issue ID 78 refers to “Camelot file mapping issue causing

discrepancies”.
c. Issue ID 197 refers to token ID mismatches and states specifically:

“Following an AP Ref Data update being enabled on Wednesday 1st
February. Post Office Card Account (POCA) transactions were unable to
complete and token IDs matched incorrectly for a number of Automated
Payment (AP) transactions, E Top Up cards and bank cards.”

5.76 As above, there are nearly 200 other issues contained in this
spreadsheet which have been tracked by Fujitsu. However, the
spreadsheet only appears to cover the period relevant to 2010 and

2011. My assumption is that Fujitsu would have had these (or simi lar)

trackers throughout the entire period that Horizon and Horizon Online
have been live, as this is how issues are tracked and fixed on a typical
project (and that appears to be the function here as well). However, I
have not yet been provided with similar trackers for other years.

5.77. I have filtered the content that appears to be relevant to the issues in
this matter and have set them out in Appendix F below.

5.78 In consideration of various witness statements, predominantly Richard
Roll, there were a wide ranging variety of possible bugs / errors / defects

within Horizon.

5.79 In the witness statement of Richard Roll °° he recalls:

“Any errors made by the Subpostmasters would be relatively easy to
identify and would normally be picked up by 1 or 2" line support. If an
error was referred to us, then it was extremely unlikely to be due to a
mistake made by a Subpostmaster, the vast majority of errors I dealt
with were due to coding errors or data corruption.”

5.80 He goes on further to state at Paragraph 9:

“We regularly identified issues with the computer coding in the Horizon
system. We would then flag those issues to the Fujitsu IT software
developers. The developers would then work on a fix” while we monitored
whole estate in relation to that issue”

5.81 In respect of financial discrepancies at Paragraph 10 he states:

“My recollection is that the software issues we were routinely
encountering could, and did, cause financial discrepancies at branch level
including shortfalls being incorrectly shown on the Horizon system. If we
were unable to find the cause of the discrepancy then this was reported
up the chain and it was assumed that the postmaster was to blame.”

Horizon Robustness

5.82

5.83

5.84

5.85

For the purposes of this report, and in line with my definition given in

the Joint Statement, robustness is summarised as:

“The ability to withstand or overcome adverse conditions, namely, the
ability of a system to perform correctly in any scenario, including where
invalid inputs are introduced, with effective error handling.”
It is important to note that robustness does not equate to a guarantee
that software is bug or error free. A system’s reliability can be improved
by rigorous testing and debugging (provided no further bugs are
consequently introduced through this process)*°° however, complex
systems can never be completely tested or ever entirely free of bugs.!°

This is due in-part to the fact that no software can ever be truly perfect

The following statistics were reported in a Post Office presentation’?
created circa 2017:

a. More than 47 Million transactions per week were undertaken in

Post Office Branches from 18 Million customer visits;

b. 22 Million banking transactions every month and 2.5 Billion

transactions a year with a cash value of £100 Billion;
Cc Circa 11,800 Branches;

d. Post Office cash supply chain collect and deliver on average 42
Billion cash, foreign exchange and secure stock each year.

Office compares the error rate or “exception handing performance” of
Horizon compared to Horizon Online. In the document it is explained

that, "...the figures are averages over the whole system and do not claim
that they will be evenly distributed”.

5.86 Anumber of failure analysis statistics are reported:

a. Counter Peripheral failures [in Horizon Online] - These are largely
the same as Horizon, estimated at approximately 1 failure per

counter per year.

b. Counter PC Failures [in Horizon Online]- These are largely the
same as Horizon, estimated at approximately 0.1 failure per
counter position per year that could cause loss of data. Note that
Power failure at the branch accounts for 80% of these cases

c. Transient failures (< 2 minutes) impacting online transactions [in
Horizon Online]- These are reduced for Horizon Online (estimated
at 6 per counter position per year) compared to Horizon (estimated

at 11 per counter position per year).

d. Transient failures (< 2 minutes) impacting settlement [in Horizon
Online]- This is a new exception category for Horizon Online that
does not apply to Horizon. The estimate is 15 incidents per counter
position per year.”

5.87 The document also records an ongoing error, “Loss of Basket
transaction Data held in PC memory” which results in an estimated loss
of transactions in a basket per counter, per year of 0.1 and in Horizon
Online of 0.097.

5.88 In my position as an expert I am unable to estimate the level of the
Horizon system’s robustness. Given the size and age of Horizon, I would
however make the expert assumption (based upon systems of similar
magnitude), that there are not many people who could. The sheer
enormity of the task to garner a thorough understanding of the code,
which would be required to estimate robustness is, in my opinion, nearly

impossible.

5.89 This is compounded by the agreed facts that there were 19,842 release
notes for Horizon between 29 November 1999 and 8 August 2018 and
each of these introduced changes could affect a system’s robustness.

5.90 For context, 19,842 changes over a 19-year period is approximately
1000 a year or 19 changes per week. It is readily apparent that keeping
on top of a constantly evolving system’s robustness is a somewhat
insurmountable task. It would not be possible to determine whether a

change to fix an area of the code did not:
a. Create a new issues/bugs with older areas of the legacy code or;
b. Add brand-new issues/bugs to the system.

5.91 Instead, I have estimated the likely level of the robustness of Horizon
and benchmarked this against industry standards based upon a review
of the evidence available including the known error log (KEL) and PEAK

system.

5.92 Several KELs exist that identify failures of internal mechanisms in place
to ensure integrity of data. For example, dsed4733R!% identifies
multiple failed recoveries occurring because of a wrongly named
recovery script. From the section above, a robust system has to
“perform correctly in any scenario despite the introduction of invalid
inputs”. Clearly this KEL details an issue that is at odds with this
definition.

5.93 Further, obengc5933K!% from 2010 shows that following network
banking (NWB) withdrawal transactions and printing of the customer
receipts, there was a loss of communications resulting in a message to
the data centre timing out. Consequently, the Subpostmaster was asked
to follow recovery but the transaction was only able to recover partially.

5.94 It goes on to state:

“It appears that the order in which txn [transactions] are recovered is by
recovering the most recent, then working backwards; however, the
oddity about this particular recovery process is the fact that the 5.00 txn
(00-215704-1-4273066-1), the first in the session, was recovered fully,
whereas the £169.31 txn NOT!”

5.95 Clearly this shows potential for discrepancies but also a lack of absolute
robustness in Horizon. This is consistent with my opinion above that it
is unrealistic to expect any large IT system to be completely robust or
bug free.

5.96 Post Office themselves have established a department called the Data
Reconciliation Service. This department’s purpose is to deal with
Horizon system problems which have resulted in unreconciled
transactions which require some level of manual intervention. Post
Office report that 10,000+ transactions per week are processed by the
Data Reconciliation Service.

5.97 The fact that numerous processes and workarounds are in place to allow
Fujitsu to modify data already recorded by Horizon is consistent with a
lack of internal integrity within the Horizon system and the high level of
need to ‘correct’ this lack of robustness manually.

5.98 Post Office acknowledge the need to improve in a “Finance Roadmap
Project” document published in September 20121° where under the
heading of “process and system gaps” it reports;

e “Multiple finance systems and a lack of automated controls...”
and

e “Significant amount of manual intervention in core Finance
processes.”

5.99 It is common ground between the experts that that each time there is

a change there is a potential to introduce new bugs/errors/defects.

5.100 The frequency of updates indicates the level of bugs and level of change

to which that Horizon was subjected to.

5.101 As discussed above, Post Office’s response to my request for
information confirmed that there have been 19,842 release notes, I can
see from POL-0219318'°’ a brief note on each of these releases and to
which bug (PEAK) they relate. Therefore, Horizon has been subjected to
19,842 changes which have been applied during its operation.

5.102 The graph below is taken from the data contained within POL -0219318
and displays the bug fixes by year.

Peaks that led to software changes

5.103 As noted in paragraph 4.21 above, the apparent ability prior to July
2017 to alter Reference Data without any formal consideration as to the
impact of this change could have had a potentially very significant effect
upon Horizon’s reliability and robustness.

5.104 Transaction Corrections also have the potential to affect the robustness
of the Horizon system. Torstein Godeseth’s witness statement! states
these are one of four sources of transactions that make up transaction
data within Horizon. Therefore, any human intervention within the
Transaction Correction process has the potential to introduce errors and

therefore affect the robustness of the Horizon system.

5.105 In addition to this, I have observed a summary of Transaction
Corrections between the years 2013 - 2014'°° which shows
approximately 20% of all Transaction Corrections raised appear to have
been deemed by Post Office as: “not caused by the branch”. I have also
noted that a different summary of Transaction Corrections issued in
2010/11 sets out that the net value of Transaction Corrections which
were not categorised as “caused by branch” was £7.4m"°. Clearly, if
potentially erroneous Transaction Correction data (or error notice data
pre-Transaction Corrections i.e. Horizon Online) is entered into the
Horizon system, this will affect its reliability and robustness.
Furthermore, if these erroneous Transaction Correction transactions
were not caused by the branch and entirely unknown to the
Subpostmaster there is a significant risk and issue that could impact

branch accounts.

Horizon Uptime

5.106 As maintained above, it is technically challenging and expensive to
achieve high availability of large systems. Horizon is a nationwide

system made up of many parts, which makes achieving the industry

standard of 99.5% difficult and the gold standard “five nines” (or
99.999%) almost impossible.'!

5.107 The 2013 Agreement between Fujitsu and Post Office'!? (at page 12)
aimed to achieve 99.53% Branch Availability.

5.108 Ihave seen reported examples of downtime across the Horizon system.
A Post Incident Report dated 09 December 2015 detailed a ‘POLSAP
Filesystem Incident’ on 5 January 2015 that resulted in a POLSAP

application outage for approximately 49 minutes?1>

5.109 Likewise, there was an outage to Banking, Card Payment, E Top Up and
Automated Payments Out Pay (APOP) on 7 November 2016 for two
minutes!"4 in addition to a Tivoli Work Scheduler Batchman outage for

approximately six hours on 7 February 2017/15

5.110 In my opinion whilst these instances show that Horizon is not infallible
nor totally robust, it still places Horizon with a good level of availability

overall.

5.111 Overall, from my review of the evidence it is likely(whilst putting aside
the large number of often required manual processes) that the
electronic processes within Horizon are relatively robust based upon the
literal, contextual, definition. Certainly, both instances of Horizon
(Horizon and Horizon Online) appear to be in-line with other IT systems

of similar size and industry.

5.112 However, this does not mean the Horizon system (as a whole) is

infallible and certainly does not imply the software is bug-free nor its

accounts free from errors. The extent to which Horizon is robust, in my
opinion, is reasonable but not a guarantee of no shortfalls or branch
account accuracy.

Likelihood of shortfalls in branches

5.113 Whilst controls and integrity checks are identified within Horizon, it is
evident that the Horizon system itself and errors within it have been the
cause of shortfalls attributable to branches. Although correcting
transactions are capable of being issued, the issuing of such so that a
Subpostmaster does not suffer the loss is largely dependent upon a) the
cause of shortfall being accurately identified b) the reporting and
logging facilities to identify such being a true picture of events and c)
the actual event being detected in the first instance. As evidenced
throughout this report, and in consideration of the Claimant’s witness
statements prepared for the Common Issues trial, there are examples
of various instances where part or all of a), b) and c) may not have been
effectively conducted.

Extent of errors in data recorded within Horizon arising from (a) data entry, (b)

transfer or (c) processing of data in Horizon

5.114 Regarding the extent of potential errors within Horizon I have analysed
5114 Horizon Known Error Logs (KELs) to determine the scope of
potential bugs or ‘PEAKs’ (as they are referred to by Post Office and
Fujitsu). Of these 5114, I have found that 163 contain PEAKs that could
be of significant interest and of these 76 are referred to in the report .
The KELs disclose that there have been actual errors in data recorded
within Horizon arising from transfer, processing of data in Horizon and
data entry. The potential for such errors therefore must exist. See
Appendix G (Failure Point spreadsheet).

5.115 Evidentiary findings in respect of points a), b) and c) (above) are set
out below. However, they do not fully identify the extent of errors in

data recorded within Horizon, only a section of those reviewed thus far.

Further, it is not clear what the true extent of errors recorded within
Horizon is since the quantification of undocumented issues is not fully
known, for example bugs / errors /defects not reported by a
Subpostmaster but possibly accepted as an accounting error on their
part.

Errors that are Potentially the Result of Multiple Issues

5.116 KEL wrightm33145J1*° (raised September 2010) entitled ‘Office has

Non-Zero Trading Position (Receipts/Payments mismatch)’ states:

“This issue was fixed in November 2010. For new occurrences see KEL
ArnoldA2153P.” (raised on 08 October 2009).

5.117 It should be noted that although the Horizon error in wrightman33145J
was fixed and new occurrences were referred to ArnoldA2153P,'!” the
latter KEL generates the same Receipts and Payments mismatch error
message but in fact relates to a mismatch during the balancing of a
stock unit that contains withdrawn product (relative to Reference Data
issues). There is no mention in the KEL if this was communicated to
branches as part of the Receipts and Payments mismatch issue.
Therefore, it appears a single “defect” could present itself as an error in

many ways.

5.118 Another example of a Receipts/Payments mismatch issue was raised in
ballantj1759Q"'® (February 2010) detailing a “Counter APP ERROR” that

has been caused historically by:

a. Falsely reported for the Office Snapshot, when a transfer is in
progress. Fixed by PC0194381 in April 2010;

b. Pressing Cancel at a certain point during stock unit rollover. See

c. Training Office producing a balance snapshot where data hasn't
been reset for a very long time (PC0210277).

5.119 What can clearly be seen here is that there are at least three issues
within Horizon that cause a Receipts/Payments mismatch that will
directly affect branch accounts. Further, the KEL goes on to state that:
“Instances of this error must be investigated. If the error is as a result
of a new problem, please add the details to the list of causes above”,
demonstrating that the true effects of this known bug may still be
unknown.

5.120 On a similar theme incorrect reporting of discrepancies can arise
resulting in incorrect stock declarations. See achai357Q??9 It is not
clear how many branches were affected but it appears that it is possible
for discrepancies to have been accepted by the Subpostmaster based
upon incorrect declarations. The problem could arise due to old stock
declarations not being automatically removed from the system. These
could only be removed by making zero-value declarations or deleting
the stock unit then waiting overnight before balancing. As a result, it
was possible if a declaration existed for a current period, it would be
used when the discrepancies button was pressed, or when a balance
report was produced, even if it had not been used for a year.

5.121 The KEL above indicates that the issue was passed to development via
PEAK: PC0208335 and the recommendation was for the Subpostmaster
to be contacted for advice on corrective actions. acha3145Q?”° which
pre-dates acha1357Q by over year provides a full support solution for
this issue of incorrect stock declarations and discrepancies. It would
seem that the problem was known for at least 12 months before being
passed to development and it is not known if the issue was subsequently

fixed and/or how widely the corrective support actions/process was
communicated.

In relation to a) Data Entry

5.122 It is evident that data entry was clearly a significant problem at the
branch counter. We can see from the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
reports (i.e., SLA Summary New WE 06072014?) and filtering for
“Correcting Horizon Errors” or “Miskeying” that there are numerous
instances of data entry errors made each week (Annex A). An SLA is a
commitment between a service provider and a client in respect of
aspects of the service to be provided e.g. helpdesk response times. In
this instance the report can be used to analyse the type and reason for

calls made to the helpdesk.

5.123 An internal feasibility study report, carried out in 2012127, was
commissioned to investigate the issue of mis-keyed transactions and
the options for preventing this problem. The report noted the following

financial impact:

“A further statistic, which was recorded on Friday 6th July2012, refers to
the value of mis-keyed Banking Deposit transactions amount to over 60
PER WEEK. The total of investigations that become necessary as a result

of mis-keyed transaction equates to £10 millions per annum (approx.).”

5.124 Further, an internal presentation from Post Office!?? looking into
efficiency gains reported: “a significant portion of demand at FSC is
driven by errors and mistakes made in branch with entering in data into
horizon. Part of these errors can be avoided with relatively small
changes to horizon". The presentation goes on to set out four changes

that could be made to Horizon that would save time for the
Subpsotmaster and reduce data entry errors in Horizon.

5.125 A further internal presentation from Post Office!** references the
findings of external consultancy firm McKinsey. This presentation
repeated the statement made previously that relatively small changes
to Horizon could avoid errors/mistakes made in branch. The
presentation suggested that the ease of implementation of such
changes as; “Medium. There exists an interdependency on IT for
changes in Horizon to reduce errors coming from upstream” with the
next steps described as; “Assess costs for Horizon changes”. The
presentation is focused upon delivering costs saving to Post Office,
through reducing support costs and did not appear to investigate any
saving which might be achieved by Subpostmasters.

5.126 An external information security review!?> was carried out in 2008 by
Infosec as part of POL’s adoption of the International Standard BS
ISO/IEC 17799:2005. The resulting report recommended various
system improvements after concluding:

“The Post Office, its agents, clients and banking partners are suffering
the consequences of a high level of transaction disputes and customer
claims across many financial, and all banking products due to a lack of
source data integrity, i.e. values entered only once without validation;
transaction value not presented to customer for validation......... banking
deposits are not visually presented for confirmation by the
customer.....bill payment and other transaction values are not presented

to customer...”

5.127 The report also highlighted the short time period available for archived
data (180 days) hampering the ability of disputes to be resolved in a

timely manner and it recommended an increase to at least 540 days. It

could request relating to transactional data in the branch database
which had been archived after two months. Beyond this number of
queries, each request became chargeable (£400-£500). It is not known
what impact the time limits on archived data and limits on the number
of non-chargeable data queries had on POL’s willingness to investigate
all branch discrepancies on behalf of Subpostmasters, however, the fact
that business constraints existed could give an inference that there may
have been limits on the numbers and types of investigation of

Subpostmaster discrepancies.

allend1645p’”” provides an example of Horizon’s weak interface controls
and lack of data entry validation. In a single sales transaction the clerk
was able to select and enter different methods of payment (Debit Card
and Fast Cash). Horizon allowed the transaction to besettled via Fast
Cash when the Debit Card payment method had already been selected.
Although the KEL confirms this is expected system behaviour and to
advise the caller of the same, it is my opinion that controls should be in
place to restrict user input error in this scenario. There is nothing in the
KEL to indicate if this could be considered for a future system

enhancement.

doubling up the amount of cash recorded. The issue appears to have
been caused because of an earlier system logout or inactivity which in
turn resulted in incomplete checks being conducted by Horizon post
logon. There was a system fix applied for this on 12 January 2016, but
this did not retrospectively correct the affected branch accounts. It is
not known how many branches were affected by this bug/data entry
validation issue and/or what communications were sent out by Post

Office. The KEL log remains in a status of ‘Unresolved’.

5.131 This issue looks to be part of the same scenario analysed in a detailed
Fujitsu report!?° prepared for the Post Office. The underlying symptom
(duplicate transactions) caused either because of a “Forced Log Off” or
use of the “Previous” key during the remittance process analysis
covered a period of five years (2010 - 2015). It was found that 88
different branches had duplicate pouches over this period. Although
most occurrences appear to have been accounted for and corrected by
the Post Office the fact that three “fixes” over five years (the last being
in January 2016) is indicative that the issue was never fully resolved,

albeit most occurrences happened between 2010 and 2011.

5.132 EJohnson3937R!*° demonstrates the lack of Horizon interface controls
which enabled Subpostmasters to carry out “Rem In” transactions
without a value being entered. Despite the system check message, I
would expect controls to be in place to restrict user input error in this
type of scenario so that a user cannot complete the transaction. There
is nothing in the KEL to indicate if this could be considered for a future
system enhancement.

5.138 There were various issues with the processing of data within Horizon.
Supporting Documentation

5.139 KEL CharltonJ2752T*” identified a Horizon bug which became apparent
when any counter level corrections made via the “Previous” key led to
both the old value and amended value being stored and used in error in
the transaction. According to the KEL, a fix was released in the Live
environment eight days after the issue was first raised. It is not known
how many undetected records were affected and if any further instances
were reported following the fix.

5.140 A recently introduced Post Office service “Drop & Go” was shown?® to
have the ability to credit cash (“money out of thin air”) to the branch

discusses the various options the Post Office were looking at to resolve

this and other issue with the Drop & Go service.

5.141 SSur343P%° records an example of a declined network banking
transaction that nevertheless resulted in money being taken from the
customer’s account. The transaction was automatically reversed
correctly at the counter but continued to be processed further through
Horizon, resulting in the customer account being debited. This incident
would have required the raising of a BIM (Business Incident
Management). The eventual discovery of a root cause and resolution of

this issue is not known but clearly there were errors in data transfer.

5.142 There are a number of examples!*°14! of E-Pay transactions crediting
the customer account twice although only one payment has been taken.
The error arose because both Horizon system authorisation agents were
incorrectly active at the same time (normally one is active and the other
on standby). This error should have been detected via an E-Pay report
for reconciliation but remains outside of the control of the

Subpostmaster, who would have been unaware of the initial error.

5.143 PEAK PC00632271* (detailed PEAK log available in Appendix A)
highlighted a bug within the Horizon messaging service (Riposte) which
prevented 401 transactions with a total value of £11,708.08 from being
processed and impacting on branch reconciliation. A workaround was
applied as a short-term fix pending testing of a long-term fix.

system functionality. Completion of all accounting recovery actions was
due by 29 January. It is not known what actual impact this had on
branch accounts, other than not being able complete any transactions.

Uncategorised Horizon Concerns

5.146 A Post Office incident summary document in 2015'* highlighted a
number of high severity incidents between May and June 2015 one of
which included a financial deficit found in Global Payment transmission
and resulted in a £20 million shortfall within the system (cash flow
deficit for Retail and Bureau transactions). The precise underlying cause
of this incident is not known and/or whether or how it was rectified.

5.147 An independent technical review carried out in 2010 midway through
Horizon Online rollout highlighted some issues and concerns in respect

of recoverability following interruptions in service. The report stated:

“There is clear evidence from the solution that both Horizon (as a result
of the PCI changes) and HNH-X are not able to recover correcty from
failures.

The most worrying are reconciliation BIMS exceptions — these are failures
that require manual intervention by both Fujitsu and Royal Mail. Many of
these failures result in end customers of the Post Office not being paid
money (the exception shows that a bank believes it has paid out the
money, whereas the Horizon/HNG-X system knows it did not pay out in

reality”.

5.148 These issues could directly impact branch accounts and covered the
period both pre and post Horizon Online rollout. The report went on to
state that due to the high volumes of recoverable data the exception

workload was causing significant (and unsustainable) workload on both
Fujitsu and Royal Mail.

The risk of data loss arising because of incorrectly shutting down
equipment and/or replacing equipment is evident in several scenarios.
A Post Office training slide‘*® specifically outlines this issue in Slide 5
regarding the Horizon Online kit used in outreach branches. The same
is true with branch terminals being swapped out!*?. In this case
incomplete transactions held on the hard drive of a branch terminal that
was swapped out were lost when the engineer failed to recover the data
from the hard drive; this resulted in data being lost.

At the Post Office Board meeting of 25th September 2013148 it was
reported that:

“Operations Issues - Fallout from Horizon issues seriously damages
public and government confidence in the Post Office... Further operational
issues uncovered (but considered lower risk and lower impact)”

The disclosed document is heavily redacted and therefore it is not clear
what “operations issues” were being discussed.

Appendix H is a constructed summarisation of the processing
components within Horizon that have been identified as common points
in which discrepancies have been recorded. A selection of the KELs
referred to in this report have been used to illustrate points in Horizon
where anomalies have either been detected or have failed to complete
the full processing.

Extent Conclusion

5.153 It has not been possible to measure the full extent of errors in data

recorded within Horizon arising from a) b) and c) above since:

i. it is possible that there are further reports and statistics that
might indicate further extent of errors which have yet to be

disclosed;

ii. The information contained within documents such as KELs etc
is not complete or comprehensive in respect of the extent of the
issue recorded in the first instance (or the full impact across the
estate and on the Subpostmaster);

iii. It is not clear from those PEAKs (bugs/errors/defects) that have
been added to a software release whether the symptoms
identified in the first instance may have manifested and been
recorded under a new/different KEL/PEAK.

5.154 However, from the documented examples of known errors evidenced in
this report alone (aside from those unknown), it is clear that significant
errors in data recorded within Horizon have occurred.

Measures and Controls to prevent/detect/identify/report/reduce

errors in Horizon

5.155 There are various methods and controls implemented within Horizon by
means of electronic system checks and manual business processes
which sought to prevent/detect/identify/report and reduce errors in
Horizon. Namely (not exhaustive):

a. Reconciliation reports and processes (Section 6, Page 96)
b. Alert messages at the counter (Section 7.1, Page 118)
c. System alerts for Fujitsu (Section 8.1, Page 127)

d. Horizon Support Service Facilities, chiefly TfS and PEAK systems

i. The number of Problem Records arising from the implementation
of new services / major releases.

5.157 From the above, it is my opinion that Post Office should be aware of all
recorded bugs/errors/defects in addition to those previously

acknowledged by them, from the process metrics compiledabove.

5.158 Of specific interest is the POL monitor that tracks the number of records
arising directly as a result of managed change activities'*°. No disclosed
logs have been found in respect of these problem records that are listed

as being reported monthly.

5.159 Requests have been made in relation to making such Management
Information reports. At the time of writing, these have not been made

available for analysis.

5.160 The Witness Statement of William Membery*®! (POLs Head of Quality

and Compliance) states:

“The Horizon system (both Horizon Online and Legacy Horizon) are and
have been subject to audits to internationally recognised standards
These audits check both technical aspects of the system and the working
practices of Fujitsu around Horizon. They provide assurance that Horizon
and Fujitsu are working within a robust system of control measures. The
audits review both the design of the controls and their implementation in
practice. Completion of these audits provides assurance to Fujitsu, Post
Office and other third parties (e.g clients of Post Office) that the financial

information within Horizon can be relied on.”

5.161 Whilst both Horizon and Horizon Online contain a number of measures
and controls designed to check system integrity, these mechanisms
have been shown to have failed. This is a point agreed upon in the Joint

Statement. It has been identified that known issues/bugs were often

deferred and dealt with on a cost/benefit basis. The Risk and
Compliance Committee meeting minutes of 18 September 20131?
highlight an instance particularly in relation to an audit performed by
Ernst & Young:

“It was reported that following the recent Ernst & Young external audit
four risks [sic] been identified. Three of the risks raised had been
addressed however the final risk, relating to the communication by
Fujitsu of changes made to the Horizon system, was still outstanding.

It was identified that it would cost over a £1m to implement the mitigation
being suggested by the audit and that this was not proportionate to the
risk being managed”.

The Ernst & Young management letter arising from the 2011 audit’?
recommended changes to strengthen the change management process.
They noted that POL was not usually involved in testing fixes or
maintenance changes to the in-scope applications (which includes
Horizon Online) and they were unable to identify an internal control with
the third-party service provider to authorise fixes and maintenance
changes prior to development for applications. The risks were outlined
as follows:

“There is an increased risk that unauthorised and inappropriate changes
are deployed if they are not adequately authorised, tested and approved
prior to migration to the production environment”

Further, as referenced at 5.188, there is evidence that despite

procedures being in place, these were not being followed by Fujitsu.

In the circumstances, whilst bugs/errors/defects may have been
identified, they were not necessarily fixed instantaneously, and control

was not retained over the process of fixing. The risk of error was

5.166 Review of ‘S80 Release Note - Deferred PEAKS List - Counter!** which is
an addendum to the S80 Release Note (dated 2005) details the PEAKS
which remained outstanding once S80 was to be implemented (this is
pre-Horizon Online rollout and suggest that only PEAKs that impact the
Horizon counters are included). Whilst many are cosmetic low severity
items, PC0121925 reports an incident caused by a problem in Riposte
which is an “existing and very intermittent” problem in ‘Live’ (it is
assumed this relates to the Production Horizon Live data environment).
It further states that the underlying cause would require Escher to
deliver software code not available for S80 or S80R (suspected further
release). The document further states that “Development will continue
to investigate to identify whether a ‘work round’ [sic] change” could be
made in the code.

Failures of measures and controls to prevent/detect/identify/report/reduce the

risk of errors

5.167 Whilst controls were in place, as per the Joint Statement, it is agreed
that evidence exists to show that these automated mechanisms have
failed to detect and record anomalies. Similarly, applied manual
processes are reported to have been subject to variations of quality
(operation outside of process).

5.168 An internal presentation from the Post Office'®’? shows the helpdesk
error processing workflows (at slide 9). Whilst one of these work flows
shows the process when an error is detected internally by the Post
Office, the four other workstreams deal with errors from different

external sources, namely:

a. “Branch discovers error/unbalance and calls NBSC”
b. “Client discovers error”

c. “Customer discovers error and call customer care”
d. “Branch discovers error and calls FSC directly”

5.169 The concern with the above is that if the Branch, Client or Customer do
not detect and therefore do not report the error, then this could well
have an impact upon Subpostmaster branch accounts without their
knowledge.

5.170 “Review of Key System Controls in POLSAP”!°®, an internal Post Office
document, highlighted procedural issues occurring in respect of
transaction data, access to software and change management. The risks
and implications identified included errors not being identified or
resolved leading to potential discrepancies in client balances.

5.171 A Detica NetReveal report issued in 20131*° indicates, in its key findings
at section 1.2, four areas contributing to risks in relation to policy,
processes and information used by the Post Office to track and manage
the compliance of branches:

a. Widespread non-conformance to Post Office policy and processes
by branches, with an_ institutional acceptance that errors,

workarounds and non-conformance exists;

b. Complexity and fragmentation of information systems which
hamper efforts both to gain an insight into branch behaviour and

root causes;

c. Ineffective process, policy and working practice in the central
operational teams to gather information, prioritise and act in a co -
ordinated manner;

d. Technology available to central operational teams was not fit for
purpose; analysis of large data sets in performed on an adhoc
basis of data subsets copied into Excel and tasking of teams is

initiated and managed through email.

5.172 Given that process, and policy adherence is crucial for effective
management and resolution of shortfalls and discrepancies within
Horizon, the report indicates that levels or risk were not managed as

appropriately as was possible.

5.173 Referring to the instance identified at paragraph 5.49 above; it is
observed that additional human operated manual processes could

contribute to electronic errors affecting branch transactions.

5.174 The End to End Reconciliation Reporting document from 27 February
20121© states:

“There is no formal reconciliation produced between the POLSAP System

and the Credence transaction stream. The Credence stream should
therefore not be used to verify financial integrity and Post Office should
ensure the POLSAP System Transaction information is used for this
purpose."

5.175 The report regarding the reversal dispute conducted by Helen Rose
states:

“On looking at the credence data, it clearly indicates that the reversal was
completed by JAROO1 (Subpostmaster) at 10:37 04/10/2012 and was
reversal indicator 1 (existing reversal) and settled to cash.”

5.176 Itis therefore relevant to question why Post Office were using Credence
data to initially investigate disputed transactions. Whilst it is evident
that it was understood by Post Office in this instance to request
assistance from Fujitsu for further material to investigate this dispute,

there appears to be further issues with the data provided by Fujitsu.

5.177 Observations of the disclosures illustrates that the initial report states
"a transaction at 10:42", whereas the credence data file shows 10:32
with the reversal at 10:37. Fujitsu's data states the transactions are at
9:32 and 9:33 and reversal timestamp is 9:37.

5.178 Whilst this hour difference between the data sets might be easily
traceable for Fujitsu, it is not clear how easily it would have been to
investigate issues where the Subpostmaster was not sure of what time
things went on erroneously in the system, or that it was a reversal
specifically.

5.179 Further to this point, an Ernst & Young review of Post Office’s systems
of internal control conducted in March 20111* identified (amongst other

issues) various issues with the Credence application.

5.180 Particularly, weak change controls within the back end of the systems
allowing Logica developers (the third-party provider) to move their own
uncontrolled changes into the production environment, which I
understand to be both Credence software code and the data within
Credence used for audit evidence. Further documentation to approve
fixes and patches applied to Credence outside of the release process
were lacking, therefore linking changes to issue tickets to record the
original request for the bug fix was not possible.

5.181 Front end change process weaknesses were also observed. The
following noted:

“During our walkthrough of user administration of the front end of
Credence we noted several users with administrator rights, including
some generic users (this is noted below as a separate point). These users
have the access rights to create and amend reports, including those which
may be relied upon for audit evidence. These users can change report
design, and processing without documented request, test or approval.
When users have the rights to change reports that are used by the
business for reconciliation, exception reporting or other processing, there
is the risk that the reports are manipulated either intentionally or
accidentally.”

5.182 This is consistent with my opinion 5.99 in regard to manual fixes where
all manual entry activities enhance the likelihood and potential for error.

5.183 Poorly handled changes introduced by Post Office to processes in
Horizon have also caused errors in accounts. A presentation'® made to
the Post Office Operations Board in 21 July 2017 explained (at page 86)
that changes were instructed (in 2015) as to the way that “MoneyGram”
is dealt with by the Subpostmasters. These changes included
acceptance of Debit/credit card payments. The presentation reported
the impact of this new working practice, including;

a. “Branches retrying transaction that had failed due to timing out

b. Branches reversing a transaction but not cancelling the AP part of
the transaction

c. General lack of understanding in the Branch of how the process

works, especially for refunds...”

5.184 The same presentation also referenced that “Camelot - Operation
simplification has gone live... early indication that this has accounted for
50% of the issues”. No detail has been provided as to what the Camelot

issues were, but up until this point in the chronology Camelot was shown
as the most frequent cause of Transaction Corrections being raisedto

modify branch accounts.

5.185 The witness statement of Akash Patny!® refers to his experience of
imbalances whilst dealing with Moneygram transactions. This witness
statement supports highlighted reconciliation issues due to timeouts
occurring between Post Office and Moneygram’. As acknowledged in
the document this could affect branch accounts due to reconciliation

differences.
Supporting Documentation

5.186 acha2230K'® highlights a problem with additional checks which were
implemented to identify system errors/inconsistencies when balancing
during branch In this instance the additional checks caused account
balancing errors on rollover. The note issued by SSC states, "This should
never happen - something has gone horribly wrong. Or possibly the
checks haven't been implemented as intended.” This suggests a
recurring issue since the checks themselves appear to have failed. It is

not known how or/if this was resolved going forward.

5.187 dsed2049S'® highlights the lack of system communication and/or
support communication in respect of certain system features which
could subsequently result in errors. In this case withdrawn products
were converted to cash on rollover but the loss was carried forward into
the next period instead of being dealt with there and then. The bug
continued until a fix was applied 6 months after the KEL was raised
(ensuring an alert was raised warning the Subpostmaster of the
occurrence). However, it is further noted in the log that POL failed to

tell branches to “rem out” some products before they were withdrawn
leading to a cash loss that would not become apparent until the stock
unit was balanced again.

5.188 Fujitsu themselves were also open to mistakes. It is recorded that a
Fujitsu engineer failed to follow the correct process when replacing a
branch terminal resulting in multiple customer bills not being paid®.
The PEAK log states:

“I believe that we shall have to confess to POCL that we have not followed
the correct procedure and we should advise that POCL make manual
payments.....”

5.189 The reconciliation process used by POL to assist with identifying any
accounting differences is not able to easily identify genuine differences
and/or differences resulting from external APS transactions from old
trading dates. This is evidenced in acha3250R?© which, when submitted
to the development team, was considered too complex to fix and was
subsequently closed. This would add greater complexity to managing
the reconciliation process and having an accurate picture at branch level
of APS transactions.

5.190 There are various documented examples of circumstances in which
Horizon erroneously created duplicate Journal Sequence Numbers
(JSN”) against the same transaction.!6!7°171 JSNs should be (by

design) always unique as explained by Gareth Jenkins’ :172

“At this point a check is made that indeed there are no missing or
duplicate jsns for any counter and should any be found an alert is raised.

Note that this could only happen as a result of a bug in the code or by
somebody tampering with the data in the BRDB and this check is included
specifically to check for any such bugs / tampering”

5.191 It is not currently clear how it would be determined whether duplicate
JSNs arose because of a bug or tampering. However, the existence of
duplicates in the first instance is in itself a failure of measures and

controls.

5.192 Aside from instances where bugs/defects and errors are recorded to
have affected Horizon branch accounts, a document entitled
‘Transaction Correction - Bramptom.doc'”*’ indicates that due to a
fraudulently programmed credit card, Subpostmasters cash
declarations indicated shortfalls. This affected several branches and it
appears it was through the Subpostmaster’s diligence that the issue was

finally concluded.

5.193 Therefore, the assumption that POL’s processes would detect anomalies
by way of shortfalls/discrepancy investigations on behalf of the
Subpostmaster appears to be incorrect. It is evident that in a number
of circumstances it is the Subpostmaster who highlights the anomaly
and pursues rectification often after disputing the initial response from
Post Office. This is further reinforced in consideration of the Common
Issues Claimant’s witness statements.

5.194 In a recent strategic and financial plan‘”* it was acknowledged that
Horizon was designed two decades ago for an environment very much
different to the one we have today. In addition, both branch and back
office systems were also acknowledged as being end of life. A recent
Board Paper’’5 also concluded that it was operating with a far higher
operational risk profile than is accepted by the Post Office when making

investment and project decisions. It is difficult to see how the Post Office
could improve things further and mitigate against risks of issues
impacting on branch accounts without a substantial investment in
modernising their IT systems.

5.195 The Post Office cash management proposals contained in a report dated
4 August 2017176 suggests that they were actively considering ways to
improve processes impacting on many of the issues raised above. It is
my opinion that, whilst the Post Office was looking at ways to improve
cash management, it is also indicative that the system was generally
far from perfect and there existed a real risk of bugs/errors/defects
adversely impacting on branch accounts despite the processes in place
at the time to prevent this.

Opinion Summary

5.196 In light of the above observations and findings aside from the
acknowledged bugs/errors/defects that Post Office have recognised, I
opine that it was highly likely for bugs/errors/defects to have the
potential to both (a) cause apparent or alleged discrepancies or
shortfalls in relating to Subpostmasters’ branch accounts/transactions
and (b) undermine the reliability of Horizon to accurately process and

record transactions.

5.197 As highlighted by select Known Error Logs (KELs), issues thought to
have been fixed recurred in different circumstances, therefore the
reliability of Horizon to accurately process and record transactions is
questionable.

5.198 It is clear that in some instances it is not always apparent whether
recurring discrepancies were as a result of system bugs or the
Subpostmaster’s own actions, or other things beyond the control of the

Subpostmaster.‘77'78 However the fact that the SSC support team were
unable to assist or identify the root cause does undermine the credibility
of Horizon itself.

5.199 Whilst both Horizon and Horizon Online contain many measures and
controls for ensuring system integrity, these mechanisms do/have
failed. It has been identified that known issues/bugs were often deferred
and dealt with on a_ cost/benefit basis. Therefore, whilst
bugs/errors/defects may have been identified, they were not
necessarily fixed instantaneously, therefore the risk of error was not
reduced as far as possible, but commercially assessed.

5.200 Similarly, processes designed to ensure controls and measures were

effective are identified as requiring improvement.

6. Reconciliation and Transaction Corrections

Issue 5 - How, if at all, does the Horizon system itself compare transaction data
recorded by Horizon against transaction data from sources outside of Horizon?

Issue 15 - How did Horizon process and/or record Transaction Corrections?

6.1 The process by which Post Office com pares transaction data recorded
by Horizon against transaction data from sources outside of Horizon is
known as Reconciliation. End to end reconciliation is the mechanism by
which Post Office establish which transactions are complete and correct
and which are not.!79

6.2 Post Office states*®° that:

”..each and every reconciliation error is the result of some systems fault.
That fault might, for example, be a software fault (introduced through
either design or coding), a system crash, or a telephone line being dug
up. Such faults may affect transactions, thus it is the job of the
reconciliation service to detect when and how any transaction is affected
by any system fault.”.

6.3 In the same document Post Office state:

“not all system faults will lead to corrective action and this is generally
done on a contractual and/or cost benefit basis”

6.4 Reconciliation reports and the known system components to facilitate it
are set out further in Appendix E of this report. For a diagrammatic
representation of the business applications applied to reconciliation as
at 2010 see Appendix B (Figure 5). In summary, reconciliation is a
complex process involving many system components of which there are
both electronic and human interactive process elements.

reconciliation systems and processes continued to be developed.

Horizon Architecture

6.6 Dated 2010, Horizon architecture diagrams show that there are four
main areas within the Horizon Architecture: ‘®

a. POLFS - financial accounting system based on SAP (later becoming
POLSAP)

b. Reference Data Proving - environment in which changes to
Reference Data are proved before releasing into live (Reference
Data controls things such as which products are sold, their price
and where in the menu hierarchy they are displayed).

c. Branches
d. Core Horizon - the central systems that support Horizon
6.7 Core Horizon Components for Transaction Processing:

a. Batching Services enable Post Office to send branch data (either
all transactions or in a summarised form) to external systems. It
also receives batch data from external systems for distribution to
branches. The systems to facilitate this within Horizon are:

i. TPS (Transaction Processing System) - provides daily data to
other systems including POLFS, POLMIS and HRSAP. Also

provides a feed to First Rate for Bureau transactions

ii. APS - (Automated Payment System) - provides daily data to AP
clients (British Gas, BT etc).

iii. LFS (Logistic Feeder Service) - provides data on pouch
collections and receipts at branches to SAPADS on an hourly
basis. Also, nightly data on cash held in branches.

b. The systems that receive data from external systems within
Horizon are:

i. APS - receives customer and tariff data for Quantum and Water

Card service once per day

ii. LFS (Logistics Feeder Service) - receives planned order data
(once per day) and pouch contents information (potentially
hourly).

iii. RDMC (Reference Data Management Centre) - receives Rates
and Margins data for Bureau service.

c. Reconciliation and Enquiry services for online authorisation Horizon
specific systems are:

i. DRS (Data Reconciliation Service) - reconciles individual
transactions for the DCS, ETU and Banking Services.

ii. TES (Transaction Enquiry Service) allows Post Office to query
transactions status for banking (only)

iii. I. DWH (Data Warehouse) contains banking, ETU and DCS data

iv. APS (Automated Payment System) which — reconciles
transactions between itself and TPS (Transaction Processing
System).

External Systems/Clients

6.8 As per POL-00030931® (2010), Core Horizon communicates with the
following systems:

a. Banks (LINK (Vocalink) A&L (Santander), CAPO) for online
authorisation of banking transactions (DCS for debit and credit

card authorisations) and transaction data used for reconciliation

bureau transactions to allow First Rate to undertake MI.

g. Siemens Metering - Provides Rates and Customer data for
Quantum gas pre-payment card.

h. AP Clients - Transaction information for Clients where payment
information is collected by Post Office.

i. Royal Mail and Parcel Force Worldwide - track and trace
information for parcels and letters taken in branch.

Transaction Acknowledgements

6.11 Some Post Office transactions (e.g. Lottery, Paystation, ATM) are not
transacted through a Horizon terminal but instead via separate
machine. However, cash taken, and stock vended for these transactions
needs to be accounted for on Horizon as part of the overall branch cash
and stock holdings. To ensure that Horizon is kept synchronised with

reconciliation at transaction level to demonstrate that each transaction
is complete and correct and report on any transaction that is not!®®

6.15 The Horizon system contains integrity checking functionality to monitor
transaction progression and integrity of transactions as they flow

through the system.

6.16 The ‘state’ of transactions is recorded as they travel through the system
with any exceptions (transaction anomalies) harvested along the way in

order that they can be dealt with using largely manual processes.

6.17 Various report sets facilitate the reconciliation process within Horizon
for both those transactions to/from approx. 130 external clients'®? and
within the core Horizon components themselves (these are further set
out in Section 8 and Appendix E.

6.18 A Horizon Service Reconciliation Exceptions document states:

“Due to the potential dynamic nature of the Reconciliation Service, where
there is the potential for new exception types to be generated as aresult
of software errors within new releases or reference data, it has been
agreed that these procedures will be documented outside of the formal
Reconciliation & Incident Management CCD document set.”

6.19 Where there is a need for manual intervention due to bugs/data
corruptions/incidents/errors, Post Office and Fujitsu teams interrogate
transaction data and reports to establish and modify any erroneous

data.

6.20 Reconciliation is therefore also used by the Reconciliation Service to
check that the corrective action is effective. '®*

6.21 Since reconciliation facilitates the core operations of Post Office, there
are various services, departments and processes that comprise it. Many

of which have evolved through the lifespan of Horizon to Horizon Online.

6.23

The POL Finance department is responsible for reconciling data within
Post Office central systems which relate to enquiries from Post Office
Clients!®°. They are also responsible for generating Business Incidents

in the event of error discovery.

In Horizon Online POL Finance use the CTS (Client Transaction
Summary) as the basis for settlement with Post Office Clients. If the
CTS file is not delivered by Fujitsu, POL Finance are to use the

APSS2133b file to manually calculate any settlement due.

Fujitsu Management Support Unit (MSU)

6.24

6.25

The MSU Unit are responsible for resolving exceptions arising within the

Horizon estate.

MSU are responsible for various reconciliation reports namely; "A&L
Reconciliation File Delivery Report”, “CAPO Reconciliation File Delivery
Report”, “LINK Reconciliation File Delivery Report” and the “DRS
Reconciliation File Delivery Report”.'?! The reports are produced For the
MSU, generated by system processing.

Fujitsu Third Line Support (SSC)

Where transactional data does not conform to its expected format or in
comparison to copies of itself or corresponding records then it causes a

reconciliation error.

Post Office acknowledge that errors may occur within counter
transactions or during the harvesting process. In addition to errors
highlighted by Fujitsu Services within the TPS Report Set, errors may
also be discovered by Post Office Ltd Finance (POL Finance) when
reconciling data within its central systems or which relate to enquiries
from Post Office Clients.

In September 2012 an internal Post Office document !°* reported; “There
is a data reconciliation service delivered by Fujitsu to reconcile the APS
and TPS streams. A suite of reports is produced’. Against this section
are the report are “Issues/Risks” which state; “Actions to resolve some
differences are not well understood and can be lengthy to resolve eg
BIMs". Post Office record the business impact as; “Manual posting are

needed. Protracted branch and customer enquires".

Reconciliation and Incident Management documentation identifies that
an incomplete transaction is not necessarily a Reconciliation error, but

it might become one if it is not completed in a timely manner!”

It also further states that (regarding reconciliation errors arising from
system faults):

“It is acknowledged that not all system faults will lead to corrective action
as this is generally done on a contractual and/or cost benefit basis.”

Data Reconciliation Service (DRS)

6.33. The Data Reconciliation Service is the system used to reconcile

transactions carried out with Financial Institutions.

6.34 For a transaction to be reconciled and considered in a ‘complete’ state

it is necessary that the DRS finds three components to it:

a. C112 (A transaction sent from TPS to Post Office Finance System
and received by the DRS)

b. C12 (Transformation of a Confirmed (C1) message as written to
the DRS)

c. C4 or D (C4 = Confirmed Client Transaction authorised, D =
Transaction reconciliation difference highlighted and notified to
DRS)

6.35 If one of the above components is incomplete, corru pt or duplicated it
is recorded as being in an exception or error state and should appear
on the Network Banking report NB102.1%

6.36 The following reports are critical to reconciliation and are recorded as
produced daily:

a. NBOOO - DRS Summary
b. NB101 - Network Banking Settlement Statement
c. NB102 - Exception Summary

6.37 An F99 transaction is a transaction state that indicates that a
reconciliation error has been reported but POL has advised that the
issue has subsequently been resolved. This state is set using the DRS
Workstation application that is used by Fujitsu Security Operations

team.195

6.40 Appendix H provides a pictorial summary of the processing components
within Horizon which have been identified as the most common points
in which discrepancies can be captured.

Transaction Disputes.
Enquiry Based Banking Transaction (EBBT)

6.41 Where Fujitsu has received notification from Post Office Ltd via the HSD
that it wished to query a particular transaction.

Disputed Banking Transaction Notice (DBTN)

6.42 Raised by POL Finance via HSD after notification from either a Post
Office branch or Network Business Support Centre (NBSC).

6.43. Where Fujitsu has received notification from Post Office Ltd via the
Enquiry Service following a query by the ‘End’ customer relating to the
state of his / her account.

Reconciliation Summary

6.44 Although there are various integrity check points and manual processes
observed within the reconciliation process, this has been an evolving
progression since Horizon was first introduced. Reconciliation processes
have developed further with the system and technological progression

of Horizon Online.

6.45 Whilst the reconciliation process within Horizon handles the integrity
checking of transaction data and potential anomalies through the
various report sets, it does not necessarily ensure all anomalies or
discrepancies are resolved as this becomes a more manual process.
Further, manual processes applied to correct data anomalies also have
the potential to introduce further errors.

6.46 In consideration that Branch account positions were interpreted and
reviewed from data flows through to Post Office back end systems
(which would determine whether Transaction Corrections were to be
applied), the following is considered relevant:

6.47

“POLSAP - Following investigation by Fujitsu, Logica and Ingenico, the
root cause of a long outstanding problem with missing data within
POLSAP was identified as out of range dates which failed the Credence
validation (in excess of 90 days). Ingenico has corrected the data and
P&BA has advised that the mismatches have been cleared within the
accounts. A permanent preventative measure is now being developed by
Ingenico. 49°

It is not clear whether or what branches this “missing data” might have
affected.

Transaction Corrections

6.48 As per Operations Manual version 719%” the introduction of the new Post
Office Ltd Finance System (POLFS) in Product and Branch Accounting
(P&BA) Chesterfield, resulted in finance teams no longer being able to
adjust client accounts on site.

6.49 Prior to 2005, branches were required to balance we&ly and produced

a Horizon generated “Cash Account”. Discrepancies were, with
authorisation from the Post Office, placed in the branch “Suspense
section” of their cash account. The discrepancy was held until enquiries
into it were concluded and it was then removed by the issuing of an
error notice (now known as a Transaction Correction) by Post Office or
by the Subpostmaster putting the money into the branch to cover the
loss or removing the value of the gain from the branchso as to balance
the account.1%

6.50 A Transaction Correction (TC) is defined as the accounting process
through SAP/POLFS for P&BA to adjust a POL Branch account for
discrepancies found.

6.51 According to POL-0032855%°, In summary, the whole process was
designed to work as follows:

a. The central accounting function decides that it is necessary to
make some adjustment to the Branch accounts. Such adjustments
are to be made at branch when branch transaction data does not

align with client or supplier data.

b. A Transaction Correction (TC) is defined which will carry out the
necessary changes (i.e. the central user will define an amount to
be transacted for a given Product in a given Branch and a
corresponding settlement Product).

c. The Transaction Correction will also define a list of possible actions
that the Branch Manager can take and also a message is presented
to the Branch Manager informing him/her of the effect of carrying

out any of these actions.

d. A daily file of such Transaction Corrections is generated from
POLFS and passed to TPS overnight.

e. TPS receives this file, validates the data and performs the required
translations using Reference Data (converting a SAP article ID into
a Horizon Product).

f. TPS sends messages for the Transaction Corrections to the
specified branches. A single message is written for the appropriate

Branch for each Transaction Correction.

g. Changes at the counter enable a person with the required role to
be made aware of the existence of an outstanding TC and apply
the correction at the counter.?°?

h. The result of processing a TC will normally be the creation of the
specified Transactions, which will be returned to POLFS as part of
the normal flow of Summarised Transaction data at the end of the
Trading Day on which the TC was processed at Branch.

i. Subpostmasters are advised to log on to Horizon every working
day to check for and process TCs as only those with Manager or

Supervisor access should process them.

j. TCs can be dealt with at log on or left until a more convenient time
later, but they must be processed before the last stock unit in a
branch is balanced, otherwise the Branch Trading Period cannot

occur.

6.52 It is recorded that it is not possible to reverse a correction transaction.
However, an erroneous correction transaction could be negated by

POLFS producing a fresh correction request with opposite sense.

Transaction Correction Options for the Subpostmaster 7°

6.53 TCs are issued electronically to the branch. At log on, the
Subpostmaster is presented with a notification of any new TC. If the TC
is suspended to be dealt with at a later point, Subpostmasters have
menu button options to access the outstanding corrections (there may

be more than one held on record to be accepted).

6.54 When a TC is presented on screen it is accompanied by the details of
the transaction to which it relates.

Disputing a Transaction Correction

6.61 Post Office documentation states that Subpostmasters have the ability
to dispute any TC given. They are advised to contact the person who
sent the TC as soon as possible.*°* Subpostmasters may be asked to
give more information to support their dispute. If a TC is issued too
close to a Branch Trading period end to be fully investigated,
Subpostmasters are encouraged to call NBSC to ask for more time to
gather and present supporting information. Where a dispute is

accepted, a compensating TC is issued.

6.62 Where a TC or branch discrepancy is disputed, and the case is not
allowed (this is not defined in in the document) Post Office state that
Subpostmasters may make a written submission explaining why the loss
(or gain) is not proper. This ensures that the debt recovery process

suspended pending a written response.

A Subpostmaster is limited from disputing a TC more than once”. In
the event of not being satisfied by the initial dispute decision,
Subpostmasters were unable to electronically select further dispute
actions. Any further action to dispute a TC would therefore be outside
of any selectable counter options

Transaction Correction Observations and Findings

6.64

6.65

6.66

There is evidence of POL themselves creating incorrect Transaction
Corrections and sending these to Subpostmasters. One example
identifies that a Transaction Correction was issued for 800 sheets of 100
stamps, rather than 8 sheets of 100 stamps. Some of these POL
mistakes were not spotted and therefore accepted by Subpostmasters.
The result of this POL error is the insertion of a discrepancy in the

Subpostmaster’s branch accounts .7°%07

As identified from review of the witness statement of Angela Burke 7°8,
Transaction Corrections were also documented against the incorrect
financial institution. Mrs Burke was awaiting a Transaction Correctionto
correct a TSB withdrawal in branch that was lost in the Horizon system
and when this was sent through it was documented as a Lloyds
withdrawal correction due to there apparently not being “a code for
TSB”. Whilst the receipt of the TCV would ultimately rebalance the
discrepancy for Mrs Burke it illustrates one example of error within the
issuing of TCs.

An analysis of Transaction Corrections?° displays Transaction
Corrections between 26 March 2012 and 28 March 2013. The largest (in
monetary terms) appears to be £810,000. Of interest, there is also a £

indicating that the correction might have initially been in error.

6.67 Of the 84,217 TC’s over this period 22,567 resulted from “Camelot” and
25,649 from “Cash Rems from Branch”. Only a relatively small amount
(945) of “ATM” TCs are referenced. Full table available at Appendix C
(2012-2013 TC's)

6.69 The witness statement of Adrees Latif?4! highlights an alleged failed
Transaction Correction in respect of incorrectly issued Camelot scratch
cards in Horizon. The correction should have reversed the stock amount
but for reasons unknown to the Subpostmaster this failed. The issue
remained outstanding at the time the statement was given, and the
branch showed non-existent stock of Camelot scratch cards with a value
of £1000.00 that was unable to be adjusted without incurring a shortfall.

6.70 Figures presented at the Post Office Operations board of 22nd March

differences against the advice note received from POL. I understand this
to mean that POL have not dispatched the correct amount of Stock or
Cash stated as dispatched on the advice note. This may indicate a
potentially significant flaw in the Horizon system. If the Subpostmaster

does not spot POL’s error and therefore it goes unreported, this will

likely mean that the next time the Subpostmaster conducts a stock take
it will show an accounting discrepancy which might lead to a TC.

6.72 The diagram in Annex B sets out a breakdown of potential reasons for
the issue of a Transaction Correction. Note that this list is non-
exhaustive and is based on the sheet headed “Possible Reasons for TC’s
Issued” within the document “NEW TC PACK P10 2011.xls”*!*. The
categorisation as to whether these were caused by Subpostmaster or
not is mine.

Opinion Summary

6.73 Reconciliation is a complex combination of electronical and manual
processes. POL approximate that over 10,000 transactions per week are

subject to manual corrections.

6.74 Alongside the electronic processing elements of reconciliation are
various phases of analysis and decision making in respect of why /where
flagged anomalies occurred. This scrutiny is crucial to determining both
the reason for the anomaly in the first instance, and to remedy the

effects of it.

6.75 Transaction Corrections at branch counter typically stem from incidents
where either a transaction has been performed in error by the
Subpostmaster and needs correcting or, a transaction anomaly has
occurred at another point and needs adjusting not caused by the
Subpostmaster.

6.76 It has not been possible to review the analysis, or reasoning applied to
Transaction Corrections issued by Post Office, i.e. whether these were
appropriately identified as issues in financial positions stemming from
the effects of a bug/error/defect or third-party error or from a counter
mistake.

6.77 Therefore, although reconciliation might identify transaction anomalies,
and appropriately capture electronic distortion of transaction data, it
does not ensure an infallible process in respect of appropriately handling
potential shortfalls/discrepancies for Subpostmasters, since there are a
range of other factors to consider in the processing and analysis of the
data. It appears that the Post Office applied a cost/benefit approach to
the remedying of _ reconciliation exceptions and _ certain

bugs/errors/defects.

6.78 It is not clear from analysis of the various Known Error Logs whether
bugs/errors/defects identified as affecting branch accounts then
ultimately progressed to the issuing of a Transaction Correction for that
branch or were confirmed by separate communications from the Post
Office.

7. Horizon Reporting - Facilities for Subpostmasters

Issue 2 - Did the Horizon IT system itself alert Subpostmasters of such bugs,
errors or defects as described in (1) above and if so how.

Issue 14 - How (if at all) does the Horizon system and its functionality:

a. enable Subpostmasters to compare the stock and cash in a branch

against the stock and cash indicated on Horizon?

b. enable or require Subpostmasters to decide how to deal with,
dispute, accept or make good an alleged discrepancy by (i)
providing his or her own personal funds or (ii) setting centrally?

c. record and reflect the consequence of raising a dispute on an
alleged discrepancy, on Horizon Branch account data and, in

particular:

d. does raising a dispute with the Helpline cause a block to be placed
on the value of an alleged shortfall; and

e. is that recorded on the Horizon system as a debt due to Post
Office?

f. enable Subpostmasters to produce (i) Cash Account before 2005
and (ii) Branch Trading Statement after 2005?

g. enable or require Subpostmasters to continue to trade if they did
not complete a Branch Trading Statement; and, if so, on what basis
and with what consequences on the Horizon system?

7.6

In a report from Gareth Jenkins 29 September 201026 (in connection
with the known bug ‘Receipts and Payments mismatch’) it is reported:

“This has the following consequences: There will be a receipts and
payment mismatch corresponding to the value of discrepancies that were
“lost”. Note that if the user doesn't check their final balance report
carefully they may be unaware of the issue since there is no explicit
message when a receipts and payment mismatch is found on the final
balance (the user is only prompted when one is just detected during a
trial balance)”.

Further, Post Office have advised?” that they have “made enquiries” as

to confirm how Subpostmasters were notified of this particular issue but

have “not been able to find relevant records so far.”

It is understood that in the event of certain counter processing errors,
Subpostmasters would be presented with select on screen messages
informing them of some form of error. This would not in itself notify
Subpostmasters of the full extent of the potential implications of an
error occurrence (i.e., the error ultimately resulting in a shortfall or
discrepancy).

Some notifications would relate to procedures of which the
Subpostmaster would be aware (a failed recovery for example),
however these would only be at the counter. A Subpostmaster would
not have visibility of any error occurring for any transaction processing
past the point that a transaction was committed to thebranch database
(in respect of transaction data errors), nor any potentially occurring

further within the processing systems.

KEL acha1941L,"® identifies that during the recovery process, when

some transactions recover but others fail to recover, it is only the

recovered transactions printed on the receipt. The disconnected session
receipt should also identifyt those transactions NOT recovered. These
are printed for the Subpostmaster to retain. This would alert the
Subpostmaster to an instance of an error in counter processing in
respect of a failed recovery (known potential Horizon incident).
Alongside the printed receipts, it is further noted that upon an instance

of recovery failure, the system might display:

“MSG90025: System Error - Error Code: 0058 has occurred Reason:
System error. Please retry once. If the problem persists, contact the
Horizon System Desk. ’?19

7.7 KEL sursi147Q?° records another failed recovery issue to which the
solution is advised as follows:

“Advise the PM to log onto the relevant counter, start the recovery
process (MSG04024) but leave the counter displaying the System error
message (MSG90025). It is important that they DO NOT confirm this

message and that they just leave the counter to time out due to inactivity

at this screen - which will take at least 1 hour 20 minutes. After this time,
they can try to log on again - when there should be no prompts about
recovery and no system error.”

7.8 Therefore, as witnessed above, it is apparent that in specific event
circumstances, Subpostmasters were alerted to certain errors occurring
at the Horizon counter. However, it must be noted that these relate to
counter errors and therefore are not necessarily notifications of bugs

and defects within the system.

7.9 Similarly, in wrightm33145j22 as part of the process for rolling over to
a new Balance Period or new Trading period; the Subpostmaster was

presented with a series of prompts and warnings if any discrepancies
are found.

7.10 If the Subpostmaster chose to cancel the rollover prompt message
(MSG31316) this could trigger a receipts/payments mismatch due to a

bug in the code when “cancel” is pressed against this message. The
workaround to avoid the bug was to press cancel a second time.
However, it is unclear how widely this workaround was communicated.
Subpostmasters would not be aware from the error message shown that

this was indeed a bug affecting a wide variety of branches.

7.11 It appears that the process was largely for Subpostmasters to notice an
error (either when trying to balance or after a communication outage)
and phoning the helpline. This would occur before it was communicated
or confirmed that there had been or was a bug/defect which might have

affected the branch accounts.

7.12 Some KELs record making priority calls to branches however, it is not
clear whether this occurred, and it is not noted that priority calls were

made in the event of every notified error.

Bugs Errors Defects not alerted to the Subpostmaster

7.13 Asabove, in respect of the known receipts and payments mismatch bug,
it does not appear that Subpostmasters were alerted, until perhaps an

investigation of discrepancy was performed.

7.14 Further, in respect of the acknowledged Calendar Square / Falkirk Issue
bug/defect it is not identified that Subpostmasters were informed.

7.15 As per the Joint Experts Statement, the extent to which any IT system
can automatically alert its users to bugs within the system itself is

necessarily limited.

7.16 Whilst Horizon has automated checks which would detect certain bugs,

there are types of bugs which would not be detected by such checks.

7.17. In respect of the Dalmellington bug referenced at 5.16, there is no
indication that the Horizon system alerted the Subostmistress of this
bug. Any rectification was therefore dependent upon correct initial
diagnosis of the bug, proper handling processes by the Post Office and

communication provided to Helen Baker and the Subpostmistress.

7.18 It will be a matter for the court to determine in due course whether
those processes worked appropriately in relation to this bug.

How does Horizon enable Subpostmasters to compare the stock and
cash in a branch against the stock and cash indicated in Horizon?

7.19 There are several reports a Subpostmaster is required to run at the end
of each working day. These are designed to be checked against the
appropriate documents to amend any errors accordingly. These reports
are then ‘cut-off’ when the Subpostmaster is content they are correct.
The cut-off routine is mandatory.

7.20 Of note there is a procedural requirement for staff at branches to count
and declare the cash stored in each stock unit at the end of each day in

what is called a Daily Cash Declaration.

Daily Cash Declaration

7.21 After performing the Daily Cash Declaration, Horizon will show any
discrepancy between the cash on hand and the amount of cash that

should be in the branch for the branch to balance.

7.22 A ‘Factfile’ document sent from Angela Van-Den-Bogerd of Post Office
to Second Sight??? states that Horizon can assist the Subpostmaster
with tracing or identifying discrepancies including event logs that are

available for 60 days (42 days preHorizon Online).

7.23 In addition to the daily cash declaration there is also the optional Weekly
Balance and mandatory Monthly Trading Period Rollover.

180503R1935 16 October 2018 Page 123 of 225

Weekly Balance

7.24 Although not mandatory the Weekly Balances are reported to be a
recommended action of POL policy to execute on a weekly basis; this

performs a full cash and stock account.

7.25 This should also help to detect any discrepancies. If a discrepancy is
discovered and declared it will be moved into a suspense account until
its resolution. The purpose of this is to act as a separate line in the
branch accounts that records any surpluses or loses whilst allaving the
daily trading accounts to balance. A Subpostmaster has until the
Monthly Trading Period Rollover to resolve any discrepancy (this was
carried out weekly prior to 2005).

Monthly Trading Period Rollover

7.26 The Monthly Trading Period Rollover is mandatory every month and as
stated above requires all discrepancies, including all within the suspense
account, to be resolved. At the end of this process a Branch Trading
Statement is produced to reflect the cash and stock shown in the
accounts matches the cash and stock held in the branch in addition to
any declared discrepancy.

How does Horizon enable or require Subpostmasters to decide how to
deal with, dispute, accept or make good an alleged discrepancy by (i)
providing his or her own personal funds or (ii) settling centrally?

7.27 Post 2005 is dealt with under Section6.48 above.

7.28 Prior to 2005 Horizon followed a similar process however branches were
required to balance weekly and produced a Horizon “Cash Account”.
Discrepancies were, with the authorisation from the Post Office, held in
a “Suspense Section” of the Cash Account (although I have also seen
this referred to as a Suspense Account). Historically these were known
as “Unclaimed Payments”, “Authorised Cash Shortages” and

“Uncharged Receipts”, to be investigated.

7.29 Following the conclusion of any investigation and in order to remove the
discrepancy, Subpostmasters were issued with an Error Notice (now
known as a Transaction Correction) by the post office or the
Subpostmaster placed money into the branch to cover the loss or
removed the value of the gain from the branch to balance the account.

7.30 The value of error notices had to be keyed in manually by the
Subpostmaster on the Housekeeping menu of the Horizon system
following notification from either a client or POCL. However, the losses
or surpluses at the end of a balancing period could still be disputed.

documentation, I note that the ability to have a debt suspended pending

an investigation has only been available since August 200573

discrepancy, on Horizon Branch account data and, in particular:

the value of an alleged shortfall; and

Corrections (Section 6.61, Page 113).

7.34 See also the Witness Statement of Dawn Phillips?** Page 2 paragraph
10 which confirms that a block is placed upon the account until the
dispute is resolved. However, if branches do not return the completed
“Branch Dispute Form” detailing the discrepancy within seven days, the
shortfall is unblocked, and payment is once again requested from the

Subpostmaster.

systems or necessarily allow him/her to make any adjustments.

7.41 I have not seen any evidence as to how known issues and bugs were
communicated to branches in advance of individual branches

communicated to branches.

7.42 I Subpostmaster feedback?*° appears to highlight amongst many other
things an absence of support and training to assist them with being able

to find and resolve mistakes. In fact, this was expressed as follows:

“There is a perception that there is a reluctance to report a shortage or a
balancing problem to NBSC as branches feel that the next stage will be
an audit and then suspension”

Subpostmasters and Post Office

Issue 8 - What transaction data and reporting functions were available through
Horizon to Post Office for identifying the occurrence of alleged shortfalls and
the causes of alleged shortfalls in branches, including whether they were caused
by bugs, errors and/or defects in the Horizon system?

Issue 9 - At all material times, what transaction data and reporting functions (if
any) were available through Horizon to Subpostmasters for:

a. identifying apparent or alleged discrepancies and shortfalls and/or

the causes of the same; and
b. accessing and identifying transactions recorded on Horizon?
Data and Reporting Functions for Post Office

8.1 The data and reporting functions available to Post Office can be primarily

summarised by the following sources:
a. The TPS Report Set;
b. The APS Report Set;
c. The DRS Report Set;

d. Reports and Data Obtained via Business the Incident Management
(“BIM”) Process;

e. Reports and Data Obtained via the Problem Management
Procedure;

f. Information Obtained via Fujitsu; and
g. Information Obtained from Subpostmasters.

8.2 Detailed descriptions of each of the above as set out in Appendix E to
this report. Summaries of each are set out below.

Official Sources of Information

8.3 The TPS Report Set - The TPS Report Set was made up of 3 reports
(TPS250/254/257) which were designed to enable the reconciliation of
transactions using branch infrastructure. They are all daily reports which
show information relating to whether transaction outputs at branches
matched transaction outputs at Post Office, whether there are
exceptions in the BRDB copy process and which branches have a net
total transaction (i.e. debit/credit) transaction total which does not
equal 0.

8.4 The APS Report Set - The APS Report Set was made up of 10 reports
that were designed to reconcile those transactions that were sent to
both the POLSAP system and APS clients. TheAPS Report Set provides
confirmation that the APS transaction account balances, a summary of
transactions which have been delivered by APS, a summary of
transactions which have not been delivered due to delay/quarantine, a
reconciliation summary between transactions which flow through the
APS host and TPS host and confirmation that all branches have been
harvested / details of any that exist in relation to harvesting.

8.5 The DRS Report Set - The DRS Report Set (sometimes referred to as
“Banking & Related Services Reconciliation”) is made up of 3 reports
which were designed to enable network banking transactions completed
in Post Office branches to allow settlement to be made with Post Office
clients (e.g. Santander, LINK, etc.). The DRS Report Set provided a
summary of all reports that were not produced by DRS due to a lack of
data, identified all C4 transactions received against each C4 settlement
date and information relating to all exceptions.

8.6 Reports and Data Obtained via the Business Incident Management
(“BIM”) Process - The BIM system was designed to report progress on
the resolution of Business Incidents to allow Post Office to complete

reconciliation or settlement with its internal systems, clients and

banks.??” A “Business Incident” describes the effect of a system fault
and can relate to any of the exceptions from the various reports or a
settlement error discovered by Post Office. A “System Incident”
describes the underlying cause of a Business Incident and iscreated to
track the root cause of the same. A BIM Report is issued for each
Business Incident in order to notify Post Office of issues and to assist in
the reconciliation or settlement process. Note that BIM Reports
communicate information concerning the resolution of an issue, and not
the underlying cause (which would be dealt with via the Problem

Management Procedure).

8.7 Reports and Data Obtained via the Problem Management Procedure -
The Problem Management Procedure aims to eliminate the root cause
of issues (e.g. System Incidents).

Additional Sources of Information

8.8 Information Obtained via Fujitsu - Most of the sources above will include
significant involvement from Fujitsu and some, such as the TPS Report
Set, will only be made available to Post Office if requested. However, it
is important to note that the above only represents the formal sources
and incident management processes. Post Office also had access to
information simply by nature of the commercial and_ technical
arrangements between itself and Fujitsu. In other words, there was
nothing (other than cost) preventing Post Office from seeking further
information from Fujitsu directly if, for example, the Problem
Management Procedure did not yield a satisfactory conclusion. This is
unlikely, as the reporting and management functions above are quite
comprehensive and should cover the vast majority of issues, but it is
possible.

8.9 Information obtained from Subpostmasters - In addition to the above,
the Subpostmasters themselves and any information available to them
were sources of information available to Post Office. These are further
considered below.

Conclusions Relating to Information Available to Post Office

8.10 The TPS, APS and DRS Report Sets along with reports produced in
accordance with the BIM and Problem Management Procedures provided
a comprehensive suite of reports which was available to Post Office.
These reports should have allowed Post Office to identify the occurrence
of alleged shortfalls in the Horizon system (of those that could be
identified), and they were underpinned by formal processes which would
provide further information in relation to the underlying cause of a given
issue, and the best way to resolve the same. In addition, Post Office
should have been able to obtain any additional information it required
via Fujitsu or the Subpostmasters themselves.

Data and Reporting Functions for Subpostmasters

8.11 Subpostmasters had access to a much smaller pool of information. This
is in line with what I would expect to see given that Subpostmasters are
the users of the Horizon system, and therefore would not typically be
given access to anything beyond what was necessary for them to carry
out their ‘business as usual’ activities. In relation to this matter, that
means being able to carry out the day-to-day transactions required to
run a post office, which are dealt with via the ‘tounter”.

8.12 All the reports and receipts produced by the counter are set out in
SD/DES/005228 - note this document excludes reports and receipts
which are not produced by thecounter. It includes hundreds of reports
relating to different aspects of running a Post Office branch (currency

exchange, insurance, stock, etc.). The reports and receipts contain basic

information relating to individual transactions (e.g. item, time, branch,

etc.) and are therefore a useful source of information when performing

normal reconciliation activities.

8.13 However, as these reports are specific to counters and contain no

information beyond this, they would not allow a Subpostmaster to

determine the cause of an issues that arise at anything beyond counter

level (and possibly even those that arise atcounter level).

8.14 For example, if an APS transaction reversal was carried out, the

Subpostmaster would receive a receipt which looks something like the

following:

8.15 This shows enough information for a Subpostmaster to balance a £5

reversal if it is assumed that all other factors are in order. However,

there is no

information relating to whether the transaction has

reconciled at APS Host or at any other level (harvester, client, etc.).

This could cause an issue which the Subpostmaster is effectively

powerless to resolve.

8.16 If, for example, the harvester failed to process the £5 reversal above
then there would appear to be a £5 shortfall at the APS Host (and
potentially at every other level above harvester). The Subpostmaster
would have no way of identifying where the error occurred because, at
counter level, everything would appear to balance, and they would not
have access to any information beyond that. This essentially means that

the Subpostmaster is completely reliant on either:

a. Horizon operating without any flaws (which is unlikely even in the
case of a robust system); or

b. Where there is a flaw, it will be identified and linked to a problem
transaction by Post Office / Fujitsu.

Additional Points to Note

8.17 There was no formal reconciliation process between the POLSAP system
and the Credence transaction stream, so Credence could not be used to
verify financial integrity. POLSAP system transaction information should

have been used for this purpose.?29

8.18 A Post Office cash management improvement proposal??? recently
acknowledged the lack of visibility for the Subpostmaster of any
inaccurate cash declarations. The proposed cash management
improvement proposal would give the Subpostmaster immediate
visibility of any discrepancies and allow faster corrections/investigations
to find the inaccurate transaction. It is not known if or when this change
was to be implemented but it confirmed that the Subpostmaster has
little control beyond counter level when trying to resolve any

discrepancies.

Issues 8 & 9 - Summary of Conclusions

8.19 The TPS, APS and DRS Report Sets along with reports produced in
accordance with the BIM and Problem Management Procedures provided
a suite of reports which should (subject to the above) allow Post Office
to identify the occurrence of alleged shortfalls in the Horizon system.
These reports were supported by manual processes which would provide
further information in relation to the underlying cause and resolution of
a given issue. In addition, there was nothing preventing Post Office from
seeking further information from Fujitsu directly if, for example, the
Problem Management Procedure was insufficient.

8.20 Subpostmasters had a much smaller pool of information available to
them, which is in line with what I would expect given that they are the
end users of the Horizon System. The reports and receipts available to
Subpostmasters generally show enough information for a
Subpostmaster to balance transactions if it is assumed that all other
factors are in order. However, this information would not allow a
Subpostmaster to determine whether a transaction has reconciled at
APS Host or at any other level (harvester, client, etc.).

8.21 There is evidence that some reports available to Subpostmasters were
reporting erroneous data because of changes made to stock units?**. In
this case some products were being double counted in a sales report. A
code fix was scheduled in COUNTER_EPOSS 34_7 but it is not known if

or when this was implemented.

8.22 In conclusion, Post Office had access to far more comprehensive
information relation to the Horizon system. If an error occurred beyond
counter level, Subpostmasters would need to rely on Post Office to
identify and resolve the issue. If that issue or its was not properly

9. Remote Access and Alteration of Transaction Data

Issue 7 - Were Post Office and/or Fujitsu able to access transaction data

recorded by Horizon remotely (i.e. not from within a branch)?

Issue 10 - Whether the Defendant and/or Fujitsu have had the ability/facility
to: (i) insert, inject, edit or delete transaction data or data in branch accounts;
(ii) implement fixes in Horizon that had the potential to affect transaction data
or data in branch accounts; or (iii) rebuild branch transaction data:

a. atall;
b. without the knowledge of the Subpostmaster in question; and
c. without the consent of the Subpostmaster in question.

Issue 11 - If they did, did the Horizon system have any permission controls
upon the use of the above facility, and did the system maintain a log of such

actions and such permission controls?

Issue 12 - If the Defendant and/or Fujitsu did have such ability, how often was
that used, if at all?

Issue 13 - To what extent did use of any such facility have the potential to affect

the reliability of Branches’ accounting positions?
Remote Access

9.1 A number of technical documents provided by Fujitsu identify that the
Horizon estate was enabled to be managed remotely. This is not beyond
expected requirements. The nature of providing a support service as
Fujitsu do, would require as a design principle, that the Horizon solution

should be completely remotely manageable.?2?

9.2 Document ‘1.8 8. Horizon Online Technical Network Architecture, Mark
Jarosz.pdf’ (dated 2010) at section 2.5.3 sets out the network facilities
that allowed “Remote Access by Fujitsu services, users and systems”.?33

The document recorded that “Support access to Counters is via SSH...”
further, the document shows that the Fujitsu sites Bracknell, Stevenage

and Ireland were originally envisaged to have access.

9.3 A further document describing the Horizon Wide Area Network High
Level Design? sets out:

“Remote support access to the counter will be provided through the
implementation of an SSH service running on the counter which can then
be accessed from the Secure Access Servers, in the data centre.... this
will allow access to command prompt on the counter for the retrieval of
logs and other data using secure copy (SCP)”.

9.4 It is therefore clear that Fujitsu had access to the servers which make
up the Horizon estate, so as to access counters within a branch. This
access was required to enable them to provide support and
maintenance. 3rd line support had the greatest level of privileges to
“Support access on platforms operating system, hosting applications
and database schemas”.”>° This level of access means that Fujitsu could
practically access all elements of data recorded within Horizon.

9.5 Further to the above access facilities, helpdesk logs identify that ‘Tivoli
Enterprise Manager’ (TEM)? and Tivoli Remote Control tools were
specifically used for accessing Branch counters across the Horizon
estate.?37. Whilst the End to End Application Support Strategy
document?** records at 1.5.1 “Direct access to live Post Office counters

is currently only available to the SSC.”

9.6 Whilst the above documentation identified that counters could be
accessed remotely for support purposes, it has not yet been identified
that transaction data was altered at the counter.

9.7 However, it is my opinion that it was possible Fujitsu was able to access
transaction data recorded by Horizon both within a branch (and also
within the central BRDB database for Horizon Online). This was how the
system was designed.

9.8 As evidenced above, it is entirely possible that Fujitsu could, as they
could run commands on the counter machine accessing and querying
the hard disk, perform modifications and deletions.

9.9 The witness statement of a Fujitsu chief architect?*° further confirms
that Fujitsu can and have inserted a balancing transaction into a Branch
Account, and in Legacy Horizon could inject transactions into branch
accounts (which at the time would have been stored on the branch
counter hard drive).

9.10 The Witness Statement of Richard Roll**° further confirms that Fujitsu
employees could and did remotely access branch accounts to perform
modifications.

Further supporting evidence of remote access

9.11 A number of the Known Error Logs (KELs) refer to remote access

activities between the branches and the Fujitsu support facility.

9.12 boismaisons1328M’*! describes running commands on counters to
assess disk space sizes. This therefore illustrates Fujitsu’s capabilities

to access the counter hard disk.

9.13 KEL acha2026Q?* (last updated 27th September 2012) documents an
issue recorded as “Unable to connect to HNGX counter from ssn’. The
reasonable conclusion being that normally Fujitsu (or other support
personal) can connect to the Horizon counter from the Secure Access
Server. The KEL explains that: “ SSC [Fujitsu Software Support Centre]
will be unable to connect to this counter until problem has been
resolved. Solution - ATOS".

9.14 KEL MillerK1837J** illustrates that deletions in relation to Reference
Data files could be made at counter level.

Global Branches

9.15 Fujitsu operate the Horizon Online Help Desk located at two sites
(Bracknell and Stevenage). These sites contain ‘global branches’
therefore they are not physical instances of a Post Office but exist as
‘virtual branches’. There are however, physical counters that perform
within them.?*4 The ‘branches’ operate with branch codes 999999,
counter ID‘s 1 - 6 and 999998, counter IDs 7 - 12.

9.16 The HNG-X Counter Business Application Support Guide 2“ further sets
out how to perform an audit of which branch a global user last logged
in at.

9.17 A register of branch codes (dated 2015)**° identifies a further global
branch recorded as WAKO1 Branch Code 999993.

9.18 An instance of a global branch would allow Fujitsu to create global users
and to input transactions within core Horizon systems as though they
had been entered from a physical branch.

9.19 It is entirely possible that investigation could be further conducted by
Post Office to identify any transactions held within the BRDB containing
the Branch Codes identified above. Such would identify where and what
transactions had been performed by Fujitsu global branches and not a
Subpostmaster.

Branch Transaction Data Rebuilds

9.20 It is understood that branch transaction data rebuilds did take place

across the estate.

9.21 POL-011672474© documents the reasons for changing a counter base
unit. Replacement of the counter base unit at 2008 would ultimately
require the branch transaction data to be reinstated to the new
machine. This would be carried out by both the engineer on site and
automatic processes applied by the HSD (Horizon Service Desk).

9.22 Further, Richard Roll in his witness statement at paragraph 1574”
documents how it was relatively common to re-create branch databases

in an effort to fix corruptions.

Transaction Correction Tools - Modification of Transaction Data

9.23. There are various identified points within the Horizon architecture where
Fujitsu may need to perform data correction activities. This involves
manually correcting data where it has become corrupted or is harvested

as in an ‘error’ or ‘exception’ state.
9.24 POL-021931074* at Section 5.6.2 states:

“There is a requirement that the SSC will have ability to insert balancing
transactions into the persistent objects of the Branch Database. There
are reasons for SSC having to do so e.g. to rectify erroneous accounting
data that may have been logged as a result of a bug in the Counter / BAL

the branch accounting code of the branch for which the correction

transaction was required.?4°
Branch Transaction Correction Tool

9.30 Users of the branch correction tool should be identifiable by its audit
table BRDB_TXN_CORR_TOOL_JOURNAL (as above, bottom right
table). The corrective transaction in the branch accounts should als 0 be
identifiable as an automatic ‘SYSTIMESTAMP’ should be recorded rather
than a retrospective transaction time. ‘SUPPORTTOOLUSER’ should be
reflected in the ID field.

9.31 It is entirely possible that investigations could be further conducted by
Post Office to identify any transactions held within the
BRDB_TXN_CORR_TOOL_JOURNAL table. Such would identify what
corrective transactions have been performed. However, given file
retention periods, it is unlikely that all corrective transactions will have

been retained from the inception of Horizon Online.

times the Host BRDB Transaction Correction Tool has been used was
responded by Fujitsu stating:

TIP Transaction Repair Tool

9.33. TPS - EPOSS Reconciliation - TIP Transaction Repair 75? documents a
further maintenance tool that “...will assist SSC to repair EPOSS
transactions processed at the counter but are unable to copy from BRDB
into the TPS (Transaction Processing System ) Host.”

9.34 The repair tool is documented to assist SSC to repair/re-repair the
transactions and send them to TIP (Transaction Information Processing )
(the remote end-point of the File Transfer Management System (FTMS)
service that delivers reconciliation reports to Post Office Limited / PON’s
(Post Office Network Banking) Transaction Information Processing
System).

9.35 The above tool allows corrective actions to be performed upon data
within Core Horizon after the counter has processed the transactions
and they are flagged as erroneous as they are sent throughthe various
processing systems.

9.36 The transaction repair is facilitated by a Form based tool that will:
a. read data from the TPS Host table holding Harvester Exceptions

b. allow the user to repair/re-repair the transactions, i.e., input any
missing data or modify any invalid data

c. validate and insert the corrected transacti ons into a 65th TPS Host
partition table

9.37 Further, at 3.2.1 the tool is stated to:

“Allow the user to do multiple repairs at speed with the minimum of user
intervention i.e., if there is a common error among several records then

the user can input the valid value just once and correct all the records
having the similar error...”

9.38 In relation to how often this tool was used, Fujitsu have provided the

below response:

“There is a master MSC every 12 months, each time such a modification

is carried out it is itemised as an MSC related to the master MSC; however
master MSCs contain many various types of changes, to determine the

number that relate to this particular modification type Fujitsu would have
to carry out analysis of all individual tasks on all master MSCs. Whilst this
type of action may have been taken by SSC it would have been in the
context of an individual incident. All incidents are recorded but the system

was designed to manage individual operations not for statistical reporting
for when a particular action has been taken by a Support Consultant.

Fujitsu will be able to answer questions on individual branch queries
where the data is still available.”

9.39 The witness statement of William Membury 2°? at paragraph 27 explains
the use of the MSC toolset which is used to manage changes to Horizon
Online. He explains that the MSC tool set “provides assurance” as to the
changes made to Horizon. Whilst I have requested copies of the MSC
documentation at the date of this report Post Office has refused to

provide these.

Effects on Branch Accounting

9.40 The above tools are noted as having the potential to affect transaction
data and potentially branch account data by way of incorrectly altering
the transactions prior to entering the recipient systems such as POLSAP
and External Clients (after processing by the counter). Thereby resulting
in potential discrepancies being borne between recipient systems and

those recorded in branch.

9.41 This could potentially result in the issuing of a Transaction Correction
issued by Post Office who may be unaware of the error induced within

the processing of the corrected transaction. Once accepted by branch
this ultimately modifies the branch’s accounting _ position.
Notwithstanding, the possibilities of Numan input error exists,
specifically if the aim is to perform “multiple repairs at speed”.

9.42 Whilst 9 above states that transactions will be validated, this is
interpreted as validated in terms of valid data types according to the
check constraints imposed on those specific columns. For example,
should a clerk enter a date into a value field, then it is assumed that
that will fail validation however, if a clerk enters an amount of 900
where it is supposed to record 90, it is doubtful that the validation rules
will interpret that as incorrect as the numerical value type is correct but
there is no validation against the amount. Therefore, human error is
possible. Projecting onwards, since these values are then sent onto
clients, there is facility for discrepancy potentially resulting in a
Subpostmaster being liable to pay for a discrepancy over which they
have no control.

9.43 Therefore, in respect of Issue 10 point (i), it appears that Fujitsu did
have the ability to insert, inject, edit and (potentially) delete transaction
data and (ii) had the ability /facility to implement fixes in Horizon that
had the potential to affect transaction data or data in branch accounts.

9.44 In respect of Issue 10 part (iii), no evidence of specific branch data
rebuilding has been discovered however, since Fujitsu had the remote
access capabilities it is entirely possible that it could have occurred and
the witness statement of Richard Roll refers to the ability.

9.45 Fujitsu had the capability and dedicated tools to alter transaction data
held in the BRDB and Horizon processing systems remotely, therefore
it is likely this would be without the knowledge or consent of the

Subpostmaster (of the branch that the transactions applied within) .

Service Desk calls that might result in a stock unit needing to be
unlocked on a counter which can be performed by global users with

Admin role:

“In such situations the clerk must call the Horizon System Desk and
request the stock unit to be unlocked. This call is passed on to System
Support Centre (SSC) who operates a manual process to unlock the stock
unit. To ensure proper accountability this manual process has a high
administrative overhead which results in significant work for SSC staff
and a long delay for the clerk before the stock unit is unlocked. This
function unlocks the locked stock unit in a quick, secure and audited way.”

The document further sets out:

“During the logon process, the user will be forcibly logged off if some
unexpected error occurs (during recovery or post logon checks (e.g.
change password). If this happens repeatedly, in extreme cases and as
a short-term measure purely as a workaround, then the recovery
and/or post-logon checks can be bypassed. It must be stressed that this
is only to be used for situations where a very fast workaround is
required in live. To bypass recovery at logon, use the following
application.properties override:logon.recoveryEnabled=false To bypass
post-logon checks, use the following application.properties

override: logon.postLogonChecksEnabled=true Note that in both cases,
when these flags are used, once logon is eventually completed, the user
may need to click on the back office/front office button twice in order to
“reset” the counter to a good state.”

Resetting the counter and bypassing recovery jobs could impact branch
accounts in that items awaiting recovery might be lost. When someone
from NBSC investigates this in the event of a discrepancy, they would

probably not be aware of the action carried out to bypass recovery.

Therefore, their understanding and belief in respect of what should
happen in normal recovery procedure will be at odds with actuality. In
this instance it could be that the Subpostmaster bears the effects of this
(unknown to Post Office) activity.

time of this report.

Permission Controls and Data Auditing

9.52 Typically, in an architecture such as Horizon, there are permission
controls set out by roles and privileges that accommodate a support
service's ability to manage the estate.

9.53 Administrator capabilities will allow for the management and
maintenance of the system. Database administrators will have escalated
privileges to allow them to implement changes within the database
systems and delegate roles and privileges to others. For example, to set
permission controls for ‘managers’ of a branch, elevated to that of a

‘user’.

9.54 Typically, documented procedures will be in place to set out what each

defined role can perform within a system. Audit logging is common

practice aside from the electronic logging that will occur in a system.
Administrator actions will typically be overseen by other methods of
audit.

9.55 For example, the common “four eyes’ principle ensures that an action to
be performed is approved and observed by more than one individual
where the action to be performed can have a significant effect (as
administrator capabilities typically do).

9.56 As there are a number of tools and means by which Fujitsu can perform
alterations within the Horizon system (since supporting the system was
their primary role) the findings below regarding the auditability of
permission controls is limited to those which relate totransaction data
amendments which had the ability to affect branch accounts (in answer
to Issue 11).

“If the Reconciliation Service identifies that Transaction data held on the

when compared to the records of the Transaction that was completed at

the Branch, e.g. a receipt, a Transaction log or a Branch accounting
discrepancy, the Reconciliation Service shall obtain authorisation from
Post Office prior to the insertion of corrective Transactions.”

9.58 It is understood that the request for authorisation as referred to above
may be that documented within the Customer Service Operational
Change Procedure.?°* The document sets out the process requirements
in respect of operational changes where changes are made to the live
environment.

Operational Change Proposal

9.59 An OCP is raised in order to make a change to the live system. The
process is administered by Post Office Account Operations and is
available to all users for the administration, authorisation and auditing

of changes made to the live operational service.
Operational Correction Request

9.60 The OCR process involves the correction of customer data on the live
system and because user data is involved, requires different approvals
and auditing. The document further states:

“Only the SSC has the authority to make changes to the data on the
system, and therefore only SSC staff can action an OCR.

In most cases, an OCR does not involve the financial integrity of the
system. Under these circumstances one of the SSC Manager, the Support
Services Manager or the Customer Service Duty Manager can approve an
OCR. If the data to be changed has a financial impact on Post Office, then
approval must also be given by a senior Post Office Manager.

When an OCR has been approved, and has been actioned, it is necessary
for two users of the OCP system to confirm that the work has been done
- an actionee and a witness. The actionee will always be an SSC staff
member, the witness can either be an SSC staff member or a
development staff member.”

9.61 Since the definition of what “involves the financial integrity of the
system” is not documented, it is not clear whether those OCRs that
could then be approved without Post Office’s authorisation were
appropriately decided. Ultimately, Fujitsu could approve and action the
OCR independently.

9.62 With regards to Issue 12 and how often facilities were used in relation
to accessing/modifying transaction data a Request for Information
issued to Post Office provided the response:

“there are in excess of 36,000 MSCs and OCPs combined; and.

e OCRs would not be used for any such change (OCRs were used minor
support changes that did not required the full approval process that was
needed for OCPs)...”

9.63 The above is inconsistent with the operational change document at 9.60

which maintains that they would apply for Live data changes.
Audit Servers

9.64 The audit servers provide an audit trail of all information on the Horizon
Online system. In order to ensure that this audit trail is irrefutable the
teams which have the ability to change data (i.e. SSC) must not also
have the ability to change the audit trail. For this reason, Audit server
3rd line support rests with the Audit development team and not the
SSC. This is known as ‘separation of duties’ and is a type of control.

Process Variations

9.65 The Ernst & Young review of Post Office’s systems of internal control
conducted in March 201175? observes in relation to Horizon (back end)
user administration:

“During our testing of the appropriateness of users with access to the
Horizon back end environment we noted one user whose access was no
longer required due to a change in job responsibilities. When users have
access to environments which are not appropriate for their job function
there is the risk that users may inappropriately or accidentally use the
access leading to loss of application or data integrity.”

9.66 As previously opined, where process is not followed, this enhances the

likelihood for the possibility of undetected error.

9.67 Further, as noted in the Ernst & Young document? there were weak
user account management controls and the granting and monitoring of
user access was highlighted as an area of concern:

Opinion Summary

9.68 A number of technical documents provided by Fujitsu identify that the
Horizon estate was enabled to be managed remotely.

9.69 This is typically expected in an estate such as Horizon to enable Fujitsu
to provide support services without physically having to send an
engineer out to each and every branch at the notification of any issue.
Software roll-outs and updates to operating system components are

typically largely distributed this way.

9.70 Regarding Issue 7, the documents show that Fujitsu could and did
remotely access the transaction data recorded by Horizon. Several
technical tools exist with the specific purpose of allowing Fujitsu to carry
out modifications and corrective fixes to transaction data. In addition, a
number of external audit reports commissioned by Post Office show that
this access was often not done without the appropriate control
mechanisms in place.

9.71 In respect of Issue 10 documents show that a wide range of users at
Fujitsu did and do have the ability and facilities to access and modify
transaction data. Fujitsu staff were able to implement changes that had
the potential to affect transaction data both without the knowledge or
consent of the Subpostmaster and/or Post Office. In addition, a number
of external audits commissioned by Post Office report that the
appropriate control mechanisms to prevent mistakes being made were
not followed.

9.72 Regarding Issue 11, business process rules should apply in relation to
accessing and modifying transaction data. It is reported that a
documented audit log of each and every occasion of live data access
exists, however, this has not been made available by POL.

9.73 Issue 12 is subject to a Request for Information currently disputed by
Post Office as to the relevancy of the request. Whilst Post Office states
that there are in excess of 36,000 documents regarding how often the
access was granted (outside of actions not needing express
authorisation that could also be carried out to fix data), these have not

been made available for review.

9.74 Regarding Issue 13 it is understood that the implications of Fujitsu
carrying out corrective fixes to data within the Horizon system could
have the potential to affect the reliability of Branches’ accounting
positions.

“The evidence supplied in the Excel files covers 26th May to 30th May. CAP 9
dates were from 20th May to 26th May, therefore I am unable to determine
the CAP 9 cause of the £1337.05 imbalance from the evidence presented.

I am also unable to analyse the CAP 12 and CAP 13 (10.6.99 to 23.6.99)

imbalances because the data required is not contained in either the
spreadsheets or the message store extracts provided. (The only data for this
period in the message store extract represents either persistent objects which
were still current at the time of the extract or messages which have an expiry
period > 35 days).

I can concur with Mike Crowshaw's explanation of the imbalances in CAPs 10
and 11. These were due to a stock transfer for £12,000 which was not settled
correctly due to the presence of a corrupt EPOSSSettlement.dll file on the PC
involved. The result of this was that the transfer out could not be acceptedI
by the receiving stock unit, leaving a Cash Account imbalance in

CAP 10 of twice the value. The effect of this error in CAP 10 was to leave the
overall balance due to POL £12,000 short causing the BBF for CAP 11 to be
short by this value and hence the £12,000 imbalance in CAP 11.”

“I have now taken over analysing this problem from Steve Warwick who
requested additional information on 13/10/1999 17:49:21. I have looked at
the information and I am not convinced it can possibly be complete.

For example he said he wanted information from 20th May until 26th May. I
opened the spreadsheet mc20may.x!s and observed it only had 6 counter 32
transactions in - is this correct?

In any case my team is not used to dealing with data in this form (
spreadsheets ). We have developed techniques to look at problems using a
full message store plus audit and event logs from the failing counter. Even if
all the relevant spreadsheets could be obtained I do not think it would be

worthwhile me getting to grips with this new method of analysing problems.

I see this is a very old problem (21/07/1999) and there have been many
software updates since then. May I suggest we discontinue investigation ofI
this particular problem but that if a similar problem occurs again you send full

message store plus audit and event logs from the failing counter’

“Could you raise this call for me. APS, PATH039, Priority B The APS Daily Account
Balancing Report (2133) for processing date 27/02/01shows 401 transactions that

“We have now found out, the hard way, that there is a bug in the new version of

Riposte installed for M1. The effect of this is to cause it to run very slowly. TIP
harvester runs first and has a finish time of 2030. After that the APS harvester
starts. The slow running meant that when the TIP harvester was stopped there
were still a lot of offices for it to harvest. By the time the APS harvester was
stopped more offices had succeeded in reporting their EOD so the APS harvester
had more offices to harvest than the TIP harvester. The correspondence servers
have now been regressed to the previous version of riposte, so this problem should
not recur.”

done to fix the problem in the longer term?Is there a fix / work package? Which
team is progressing the fix? Thanks”

“pm has problems regarding a fault with there bureau, something to dowith
a decimal point

Contacted: paul buttler who help with the implimentation of the bureaude
change at the p.o advises that the problem which is arising at the p.o is due
to a decimal point missing on the horizon system on the ‘euro line' which is

causing a decrepency.

pm declares euros, but does not show on the balance snap shot. pm does
transaction log @ 14.34 on gateway which shows all the euros she has
declared but it does not show up as the sterling equivellent. eg. DDP euro
5786500 = sterling 0.00 NB. this problem is only showing for euro's. All other
currency's are showing ok in the system

When the pm is now trying to reverse the transaction the figure is doubling.

Can ssc please investigate as a matter of urgency why the bureau de change

is not updating on the system for euro's currency on the system”

“The receipts payments mismatch is a duplicate of 98480 currently with RMF.

In other words users should NOT be allowed to reverse system generated
revaluations thus. The initial problem with the large amounts I believe the
system has coped OK and has alerted a red event to say so. Perhaps the only
thing the system should hve done based on the current spot rate as time of
declaration would be to refuse to allow such a number to be entered because
it would blow a system limit. This is potentially flawed should a new spot rate

“The clerks/PM@@s should be alerted to the fact that they should NOT under

“In summary This PinICL has exposed two potential problems. 1) Clerks can
reverse an auto-generated Bureau revaluation. This is a duplicate of 98480.
2) Clerks declare foreign currency daily.

The counter software checks to see if the figure declared matches the system
generated figure. If the declared figure does not match the system figure the
outlet has ?lost? some currency and there will be a discrepancy. If this
discrepancy is greater than 1 million pounds an error is produced whereby
the sterling equivalent is set to zero, but the declared foreign currency figure
is retained. When entering the daily foreign currency declaration there may
be the odd small discrepancy, but there will not be one of 1 million pounds
worth unless there was a robbery ? but a million pounds of a particular foreign
currency in stock is too high anyway.

The clerk produced this problem because two many zeros were added to the
generated figure would have been zero for every currency. Under normal
operation a discrepancy would make the clerk double check the entered figure

or explain the difference in stock. To prevent this second problem from arising
by changing code we would have to check each declared foreign currency
when entered to decide if the sterling equivalent of any discrepancy would
exceed 1 million pounds. This would require a sizeable rework with associated

changes to dialogues, etc.

Development would rather not have to make this change. I think this second
problem can be covered by a KEL with no code change made. Small
discrepancies will occur and will need checking and explaining. Post migration,
large discrepancies should not happen. Discrepancies of more than a million

pounds worth should never happen.

If we stop the ability of reversing an auto generated Bureau revaluation
(98480) no further damage can be done by making incorrect declarations. By
just making a correct declaration and performing a trial balance (with no
commit) the error will be resolved. It may be worth passing this PinICL to
John Pope in Requirements for him to find out if the customer is willing to pay
for a code fix for item 2) or whether PO is prepared to accept that item 2) is
unlikely to happen and there is an easy way to put things right if it does
happen (re-declare and perform a trial balance). declaration. £30,000 worth
of Euros was turned into £3,000,000.

Bureau sites were being migrated from the existing MoneyChanger system to
Horizon. The instructions were to declare all MoneyChanger stock on the new
Horizon Bureau system. Effectively all transactions were discrepancies as the

system.”

“During the 25 RBS Grp Cash Withdrawal, the banking transaction had fully
completed, including the receipt print but disconnected session at
settlement (Comms issue).

Recovery also failed because of same comms issue.

As per KEL, transactionState=1 the banking transaction had fully
completed, including the receipt print, and money should have changed
hands. If recovery had succeeded, it would have automatically completed
the session. So you can assume that the transaction was completed
successfully. The customer's account will be correct but the branch will have

a shortage for 25 withdrawal because the session hasn't been recorded.”

Horizon Reports

TPS Reports

15.1. TPS Reports were set out in the “TPS Report Set” which was designed
to enable the reconciliation of transactions that were carried out in
branches using the branch infrastructure. It was sent to the POLSAP
system and the POLMISs (Credence), and was made up of the following

reports:

15.2 TPSC250: Host Detected Transaction Control Errors - Daily report which
shows detail for any Post Office branch where the control totals for the
transactions output by the Host to POLSAP and Credence do not match
the Daily Transaction Totals calculated by the counters.

15.3. TPSC254: Harvester Exceptions - Daily Report which shows a list of
exceptions detected by the BRDB copy process when failing to process

one or more messages.

15.4 TPSC257: POLSAP Incomplete Summaries Report - Daily report which
identifies all Post Office branches in which the net total transactions
(debits/credits) does not equal 0.

15.5 The TPS Report Set contained information which would allow Post Office
to identify the errors or inconsistencies set out above, which could
include shortfalls. However, the investigation of the cause and
resolution of TPS exceptions and errors was not dealt with within the
TPS Report Set. Resolution was dealt with through “Business Incidents”
and the underlying cause was investigated via “System Incidents”, both
of which are part of the Business Incident Management (BIM)

procedure. This is considered in more detail below.
15.6 There are 2 additional points to note in relation to the TPS Report Set

15.7. There was no formal reconciliation process between the POLSAP system

and the Credence transaction stream, so Credence could not be used to

verify financial integrity. POLSAP system transaction information should
have been used for this purpose.

15.8 The TPS Report set was not intended to be shared with Post Office, but

it was available upon request.

APS Reports

15.9 APS reports were set out in the APS Report Set which was designed to
ensure APS Transactions completed in Branches are reconciled with the
Transaction stream received by the POLSAP System to enable
settlement to be made with Clients. The APS Report set was made up
of the following reports

15.10 APSS2133: APS Daily Account Balancing Report - The objective of this
report is to confirm that the APS transaction account balances for the

processing day.

15.11 APSS2133b: APS Client Summary Report - Objective is to provide a
summary of the transactions which have been delivered by APS during
the processing day. The summary is produced by the clearing agent (i.e.
the organisation to which Fujitsu Services deliver the transactions). For
each clearing agent, a breakdown is provided by Client account for each
transaction date. Transactions delivered to Manual are processed
manually and consequently are not reported here.

15.12 APSS2133c: APS Delayed Transactions Report - Objective is to provide
details of all transactions which have not been delivered by Fujitsu
Services because they have been delayed/quarantined within the APS
Host system. Initial Customer Support resolution will cause the
transactions to be returned for normal processing or sent to manual for
manual processing. TPS quarantined APS transactions will show up as a
discrepancy on the APS Daily Account Balancing Report.

15.13 APSS2136: Daily TPS / APS Transaction Reconciliation Summary Report
- Normally, APS transactions flow through the TPS Host to POLSAP and
through the APS Host system within the same working day. However,

POL00258234

180503R1935 16 October 2018 Page 190 of 225

the rules associated with the processing of APS transactions within the
TPS Host and the APS Host systems are different. Consequently,
transactions may be placed in exception status by APS but be accepted
as valid by TPS. This reconciliation point is at the end of the processing
day. It reconciles the APS transactions at Branches and APS
transactions delivered by TPS to POLSAP. It maintains a record of which
transactions have passed through the TPS side and which transactions
have passed through the APS side and on a daily basis it reports

transactions which have been processed by one side and not the other.

15.14 APSS2136b: Daily TPS / APS Transaction Reconciliation Client Account
Exception Report - Objective is to identify Client account exceptions
when comparing the actual number and value of transactions that were
processed by TPS (TIP) and APS (Client) for the last 30 days.

15.15 APSS2136c: Daily TPS / APS Transaction Reconciliation Detail Exception
Report - The objective is to report all transactions for the last 30 days
which are different in POLSAP to Client delivery. Differences may occur
either as a result of some error condition, or in the case of unmatched
TPS/POLSAP transactions, as a result of bus iness processing rules being
different from those of APS/Client transactions.

15.16 APSS2139: Daily APS Office Harvesting Report - The APS Harvester
Reconciliation was used to ensure all Horizon Branches had been
harvested. As Horizon Online does not rely on harvesting of transaction
this report is no longer relevant.

15.17 APSS2140: APS Harvester Transaction Totals Summary - Objective is
to provide Branch totals and harvested totals by transaction date for
each of the last 30 transaction days for the APS Harvester.

15.18 APSS2140b: APS Harvester Transaction by Office - Objective is to
provide details by Branch code of any discrepancies that exists in the
overall totals shown in the APS Harvester Transaction Totals Summary.

15.19 APS2134: APS Validation Status Report - Objective is to identify the
success or failure of the APS Validation process. This compares the
volume of normal transactions and the value of all transactions between
each Client Transmission file and the corresponding fields in the CTS
sub-file.

15.20 Rejected Sub-Files Report - The Times Rejected column will indicate
how many times that the sub-file has been rejected and will indicate
whether there is an ongoing problem with poor quality data in corrected
files. If the quality of the data in the external transaction file is good
then we would not expect any output from the report.

15.21 Similar to the TPS Report Set, the APS Report Set would allow Post
Office to identify the errors or inconsistencies set out above, which could
include shortfalls. However, the investigation of the cause and
resolution of APS exceptions and errors was not dealt with within the
APS Report Set. Resolution was dealt with through the BIM procedure
which is set out in more detail below.

Banking & Related Services Reconciliation (DRS Report Set)

15.22 The Banking & Related Services Report Set was designed to enable
Santander, CAPO, LINK, Global Payments Inc., and Epay transactions
completed in the Branches to be reconciled in order to allow settlement
to be made with Clients, or direct settlement to specific Clients and/or
Banks. It was made up of the following reports:

15.23 NBOOO: DRS Summary - This report summarises all reconciliation
reports produced by the DRS. It also summarises all reports that were
not produced by the DRS because there was no data to report.

15.24 NB101: Network Banking Settlement Statement - This report identifies
‘C4’ transactions received against each ‘C4 Settlement Date’ as reported
to the DRS for the most recent processing date. The report will be used
by Post Office Ltd. as a basis for settlanent of Network Banking
transactions with the Financial Institutions (FIs).

Reconciliation and Incident Management

15.26 The BIM system was designed to report progress on the resolution of
Business Incidents to allow Post Office to complete reconciliation or
settlement with its internal systems, clients and banks.

15.27 A™Business Incident” is defined as the symptom of an underlying cause
- e.g. the effect of the system fault on the resulting reconciliation or
settlement information sent to Post Office. A Business Incident can

relate to any of the exceptions from the various reports above or one

15.30

15.31

15.32

A “System Incident” is defined as the underlying cause of a Business
Incident and is created to track the root cause of the same.

Depending on the impact, nature and scope of the Business Incident the
POA Problem Management Procedure may be invoked. However, if the
nature of the Business Incident is agreed to be low priority or a one-off,
the BIM reconciliation procedure would suffice. The choice of procedure
is determined by discussion and agreement between Post Office and the
Reconciliation Service for specific Business Incidents as they occur.

BIM Reports are issued for each Business Incident generated. BIM
reports are designed to notify Post Office Finance of the déail required
to assist in the reconciliation or settlement process within Post Office.
BIM Reports communicate information concerning the resolution of the
symptom of an underlying cause, not the cause itself. This information
would be supplied via the Problem Management route, if escalated to
that level

The Problem Management Procedure

15.33

The aim of Problem Management is to investigate, eliminate or prevent
causes of Incidents and known errors regarding Post Office Account and
Post Office Limited Infrastructure / Information System and to prevent

the recurrence of Incidents related to these errors. A “Problem” in this

respect is defined as the unknown underlying root cause of one or more
incidents.?”°

15.34 The Problem Management Process covers both reactive and proactive

functions of Problem Management.

15.35 Whilst there are several responsibilities detailed within the process
document, no mention of advisory to Subpostmasters whereby an
incident may affect branch accounts is detailed. It could be that this was
incorporated within the “investigative” phase, but I would expect some
low-level detail to be provided as to what to do in the event that a
problem that has the potential to reoccur, might impact, and how to
handle such.

15.36 As highlighted in the same process document, effective Problem
Management is dependent upon the effective use of the process by
Fujitsu, Atos, POL and third parties. We have not yet established that it
was the case.

components within Horizon that have been identified as common points

in which discrepancies have been recorded.

18.2 The first diagram displays each of the failures examined overlaid on top
of each other. This helps to illustrate that the different aspects of

Horizon have suffered failures.

18.3. The diagrams that follow take each of the failures individually and
attempt display the flow of the transaction (using the dotted coloured
lines) to understand where the failure occurred.

Issue: MSU report a transaction State 4 on one of the NWB reports,
C4 only. TES shows request and authorisation messages but no
confirmation. Post Office Counter log shows transaction being
declined by the pinpad: MSG00999: Card Removed Too Early.

No cOMessageDetail, hence the transaction does not get reversed.

Summary: Since a State 4 transaction implication is potential for
incorrect settlement with the Financial Institution (FI) and/or incorrect
adjustment of End Customer Account, considering the above KEL
records that the transaction was not reversed as it should have been
it is likely that branch accounts were affected potentially recording a

Title Incorrect cash declarations

received by Cash Management -
errors relating to cash

management
Raised 22/06/2012
Last Updated 22/06/2012
Release System HNGX
System Product CounterBusinessapplications

Issue: ... it appears that somewhere after leaving Horizon but before
getting into the cash management system, an adjustment is being
made to add the branch Cash in Pouches overnight figure to what they
have actually declared. But rather than using the value for the correct
trading day, it is using the value from the previous day . Hence the
declarations being used by the Cash Management system do not
match the cash actually in the branch.

This problem will only affect branches which frequently hold large

amounts of cash in pouches overnight - these are likely to be the
larger branches. If they are affected by this problem, it is NOT user
error and they can't do anything to correct it themselves. Rebecca

Portch (Inventory Manager - South, Post Office Ltd - Supply Chain) is
aware of the problem - the branch could check with her, via the cash
management team, whether this could be the cause of the apparent
differences.

branch differences could be corrected however, this still evidences an
issue in the data integrity in that incorrect values were being
erroneously added to branch accounts.

Title NB102 Section 5 State 4 - PM

pressing cancel on counter
moments after the customer has
entered their PIN on pinpad

Raised 28/01/2013

Last Updated 20/11/2015

Release System HNGX

System Product HNG-X Counter(CNT)

Issue: The cash withdrawal was initiated and the customer got as far

as successfully completing PIN entry on the pinpad. However, within
milliseconds of this the PM has pressed Cancel on the counter. ThisI
appears to have put the counter and pinpad in a confused state as an
authorisation request (R1) was generated despite the counter and

pinpad also trying to cancel the transaction.

The PM ended up being prompted with a message saying that the
transaction had been declined and a CANCELLED receipt was
produced for it. Moments after this a successful authorisation
response (A3) was then received which caused an 0291 System Error
to occur. The PM pressed Continue and was returned to the Front
Office home menu from where they continued the transaction session
by selling some stamps before settling the basket by Fast Cash.

On the branch database the cash withdrawal has been recorded as a
zero value and as a CANCELLED receipt was produced the PM should
not have handed any money over to the customer so this is ok.

However, a CO reversal was not generated for the transaction and the
DRS hasn't got the C12 or C112. It just has the £142 C4 which means
£142 has been taken from the customer account. The recovery table

on the branch database showed no recovery outstanding for this

transaction.

Summary: This ultimately would require input from Post Office to

manually reconcile the issue where there are discrepancies.

System Product HNG-XCounter(CNT)

Issue: It is been noted that two AP dangerous goods transactions 6
minutes apart on the same counter in two different baskets. Both
record the same CuRef (barcode), same AP token, same client code
and SVC, but one of them has client account code 3047 (correct) and
the other 3046 (incorrect, does not exist in ref data).

On investigation, we find that the issue is either not reproducible or
there is no code which seems to cause this issue. On every retry, the
client accounting code is always posted correctly to 3047.
Additionally, the reference data is verified and there is no client

accounting code with 3046.

Occurrences of this issue is rare however it has business impact so, a
fix will be provided to prevent this from happening i.e. to add a check
and verify if the clientAccountCode exist in ref data and raise a system

error if it does not.

Issue: Streamline report that they have received a payment file

It looks like a problem with the confirmation agent which has

Issue: The clerk initiated a Drop and Go transaction for £100 which
failed due to timeouts, but then a success message was displayed.
The clerk settled the transaction and the customer handed over £100.
The customer checked the balance and stated that the top up had not
gone through, so the clerk then performed another Drop&Go
transaction which was successful. The customer has paid in £100 but
the branch account has been debited by £200. Accenture verified that
only the second Drop&Go top up was successful.
