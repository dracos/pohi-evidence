INTRODUCTION
A quorum being present, the Chairman opened the meeting.

The Chairman reminded the Board that this was to be Susannah
Storey’s last meeting as a Non-Executive Director and thanked
Susannah for her contribution to the Board.

PROJECT SPARROW

The CEO reminded the Board of the background to Sparrow and the
Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme (‘the Scheme’), and
introduced the work which Linklaters had been asked to undertake to
clarify the Company's legal position.

Chris Aujard, General Counsel, Angela Van Den Bogerd, Network
Change Operations Manager, and Christa Band from Linklaters LLP

joined the meeting.

(c) Christa Band presented the legal advice to the Board, which dealt
with the Company's contractual relationship with sub-postmasters
and the Company's right under the contract to recover losses. She
emphasised that the advice focussed on the legal issues, not
questions of fact or individual cases. Christa Band questioned the
approach taken by Second Sight with respect to the work produced
by them to date. In particular she would have expected them to:

(i) produce a review of the system as a ‘baseline’ before
considering any specific complaints; and

(ii) cite hard evidence to back up any conclusions made.

(d) The Board discussed the Scheme and possible compensation
payments. Christa Band explained that, because of the terms of the
contract between sub-postmasters and the Post Office, the Company
would not be required to pay compensation and that if compensation
were given this would not give sub-postmasters outside the scheme
any legal right to demand such compensation although it may lead to
claims of ‘unfairness’.

(e) Christa Band explained that English Law did not allow for
compensation for distress as claimed by many of the cases in the
Scheme.

(f) The Board thanked Christa for her report covering the legal aspects
of the claims against the Business. Christa Band left the meeting.

ACTION: (g) The Board agreed to set up a Sparrow Board Sub Committee which
Company the Chairman would Chair and would involve the CEO, Alasdair
Secretary Marnoch (Chairman of the Audit Committee) and Richard Callard.

Other NEDs were invited if they wished to join.

(h) The CEO reported on other work underway. She noted that the
quality of the work undertaken by Second Sight had been challenged
by Sir Anthony Hooper, Chairman of the Working Group, who was
now insisting on more evidence based reports.

{i) The CEO had met the CEO of the Financial Ombudsman Service to
understand the principles they would recognise as good practice for
goodwill payments.

(j} The CEO, General Counsel and Angela Van den Bogerd had also
attended an MPs meeting, called by James Arbuthnot, at which a
couple of the MPs with cases in the Scheme were pushing for
compensation for their constituents.

({k) The Board agreed that they needed to commission a piece of work,
to complement that undertaken by Linklaters, to give them and those
concerned outside the Business, comfort about the Horizon system.
The Business was asked to revert with the terms of reference and
timescale for the work which should cover:

e The work undertaken by Angela Van Den Bogerd explaining

POL00021523
POL00021523

Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential

how the system works
e A review of the data integrity aspects of the system
e Areference to all audits and tests carried out on the system
e Aresponse to the most significant thematic issues raised by

Second Sight.
ACTION: () These terms of reference should be tested with Linklaters to ensure
Chris Aujard that this work would satisfy them as evidence that Horizon is reliable

and then agreed by the Board Sparrow Sub Committee.

(M) The Board noted the update on the Scheme.

(n) After due consideration, and in the interest of regularising Second
Sight's engagement, the Board authorised the execution of the draft

ACTION: engagement letter. Chris Aujard was asked to try to extend the time

Chris Aujard period restricting Second Sight from acting against the Company
beyond a 12 months period.

ACTION: (0) The Board requested a one page lessons learned covering 3 or 4

Belinda Crowe areas by the next Board meeting.

(P) Chris Aujard and Angela Van Den Bogerd left the meeting.

POLB 14/33 BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME

(a) Tim Franklin declared an interest in two of the Companies who may
be involved in this work. It was noted that he is a strategy advisor for
Firstsource, and a member of the advisory board at L&T Infotech,
both interests had been previously logged with the Company
Secretary.

(b) The Board welcomed Neil Hayward, Group People Director, and
Lesley Sewell, Chief Information Officer, to the meeting and received
an update on the Business Transformation Programme.

(c) The CFO explained the changes since the last Board meeting and
the decision to spend more time on the design phase of the plan. He
acknowledged that the effect of this delay would be to produce a gap

ACTION: in the strategic plan in 2014/15 of circa £10-15million which the

Chris Day Business would need to find more radical options to cover. Supply
Chain was one of the areas being considered, which would be
presented at the May Board.

ACTION: (d) The Board asked the CFO to model the scenario where revenue
Chris Day remained flat next year, to show the cost savings which would be
required to hit the strategic plan profit target.

(e) The CEO explained the recruitment process for an_ interim
Transformation Director and that additional consultant assistance
was being sought, so that the business would be fully supported.

(f) Lesley Sewell assured the Board that the base case now being
considered included a model where TUPE applied.

APPROVAL OF 2014-15 BUDGET AND SCORECARD TARGETS

Further to previous discussions, the Board received a request to
approve the 2014-15 budget.

The Board recognised the challenge in the revenue budget and were
concerned by the level of growth required as compared to this year's
performance. The CFO reported that the Commercial team were
committed to delivering these numbers and that they recognised the
importance of hitting revenue targets to help achieve breakeven for
the Crown network.

The CEO explained that she had set up a Commercial Committee,
which is chaired by Martin George, to drive the revenue and ensure
that the Business have the right incentives in place. The commercial
team would be presenting their plans at the April Board.

e noted the actions being taken in response to the
challenges given on the Board conference call on 10

budget; and

e noted the development of the Key Performance
