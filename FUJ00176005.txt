Hi

If you are not already aware Post Office are involved in a long ongoing dispute between the Post Master’s and the
Post Office. There is a trial now taking place and Fujitsu are also in court to support a stream on the Horizon system.
There has recently been press information on extracts of the two trials and these court appearances will go on for the
near future.

Duncan and Gavin are conscious that your Clients may refer to the articles and therefore ask questions regarding
Fujitsu. The company line is that we are supporting Post Office in their trial with some of the postmasters and given

the seriousness of the prosecution we cannot comment at this time. The trial is against Post Office and not Fujitsu.

Graham Goulden from our press office is completely up to speed with the proceedings and progress and he will issue
statements or responses to the media where appropriate.

I can answer any immediate customer queries.

Wendy
