Lesley,

Quite a lot of info here but I wil l outline what we agreed on this issue

Word documents attached are the letters going out to branches on Monday. They have been approved by Legal and
P&BA (Andy Winn) and SD (Tony J).

I ran Mike G, Mike Y and Andy M through the detail last week. We have agreed to write off the losses and repay the gains
via Subposmaster pay. We have a document from Fujitsu on what happened (See pdf file). This provides audit trail and
shows what happened for a branch, as well as events generated and logged by Fujitsu, plus what the branch saw on their
reports. I am just awaiting clearance from Network (Anita Turner) re how to approach NFSP (propose to final ise that on
Monday for 62 branches affected as shown on excel sheet).

Matt Hibbard was happy with the process and Fujitsu document, as Rod was off. Andy Mac has taken action from Mike Y
to ensure we maintain closer links with P&BA/Rod. Tony J (Live Service/Problem Management team) is already working
on issue management and how P&BA raise issues with SD, and this will help SD to formally raise and resolve them with
Fujitsu.

Both Mike's were keen we use this as a positive, eg old Horizon would not have picked this up, yet the logs in Data
Centre, and Event alerting meant we picked this up, and can demonstrate through reports what happened. We can
generate reports for each branch if chal lenged.

We are writing to branches, and following up with call from NBSC/P&BA, with walkthrough of the detail as required. We
have commitment from Fujitsu to visit any branches to run them through what happened with them. We have had receipt
and payment mismatches before, so this is not something new to manage, albeit that this issue was very complicated in
how it was reported, and evident to the branch.

If you need anymore give me a call.
