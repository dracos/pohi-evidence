ICL Pathway Ltd Customer Services Complaint Procedure Ref: CS/PRO/116
Version: 2.0
Company in Confidence Date: 31-Jan-2001

1‘ Introduction

Complaints may arise from a wide variety of sources and may relate to the working of
any of the processes required to support Pathway operations. Effective and responsive
complaint handling is critical to the success of the Company. When complaints are
received in Customer Services, local processes and procedures are in place to
facilitate initial complaint management and minimise the number of complaints,
which require escalation.

2 Scope

The Complaints procedure is a backstop for situations outside the scope of other
improvement procedures. It is not intended as a substitute for procedures such as the
Helpdesk procedures, which are intended to address the bulk of customer and client
situations. Wherever possible, complaints are input to these alternative procedures for
resolution.

3 Key Processes

This section outlines the handling and escalation procedure, which should be carried
out when a customer wishes to raise a complaint incident.

Complaints will be raised at the request of the customer and may come from a number
of different sources:

e Post Office outlet direct to ICL Pathway Customer Services

Post Office outlet via ICL Corporate

Post Office outlet via Horizon System Helpdesk
PON BSM

PON Network Business Support Centre

This section details the following information:

e Initial identification of a complaint incident

e The process by which the incident is logged within the Customer Services
complaint database

e Initial investigation and any escalation to a Senior Manager

e Subsequent actions/escalations and contacts to assist with obtaining resolution

¢ Closure agreement

3.1. Identification of a complaint

The Customer Service complaint manager will confirm from the information
presented that the incident is a valid complaint using the following guidelines:

e The complaint is proper to ICL Pathway
e Incident raised through HSH, clearly documents all actions carried out by
Horizon Helpdesk
e Incident raised through PON BSM, has been logged clearly with full details
e Incident logged by NBSC, clearly documents all actions carried out by NBSC

As discussed on xxxxxx, it is a standard requirement for the engineer to assess how damage may have occurred.
The printer in particular is prone to damage if the correct procedure is not followed at all times. From our
conversation you have confirmed that the engineer has advised on the correct method for removal of the old

paper roll, you have confirmed that this is the procedure you are following.

Hopefully, there will not be a reoccurrence of the original problem. Thank you for taking the time and effort to

write to ICL Pathway.
