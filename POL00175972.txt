| know my memory isn’t what it used to be but think this might relate to Jon Longman’s West Byfleet case. Apparently
it was raised by a couple of the team (not Jon) at a recent focus group meeting led by Nigel.

Graham,

at yesterdays SLT Nigel Viles mentioned that one of the investigators had mentioned concerns re: Horizon
challenges in one of his cases (this being you I believe). Please see my recent reply to the team on this matter. If
however you need further and specific support please let Jason/myself know or if required contact Dave K.
Reds,

Andy

Andrew,

Sue Lowther's team have reviewed this on behalf of Security and will be producing a briefing summary for the
stakeholders. In essence it will state that there are no underlying issues or trends identified regarding the Horizon
challenges to date and that we will continue to 'manage' each case as and when further challenges arise. This is also
the recommendation from the Legal team in that if we carry out a ‘drains up’ exercise we are leaving ourselves open
to an even greater risk of challenge (i.e. in simple terms: why are you looking if you say everything is okay!).

Jason/Andrew:
However and from a fraud casework perspective can you ensure that all case challenges/issues moving
forward are captured, monitored and reviewed (please liaise with the casework team).

Dave,

Following our previous discussions not sure where you are with this, spoke to Sue last week re: producing the
summary report for stakeholders.

Reds,

Andy

Hi All,
Have you guys heard anything from the PO executive on the Horizon integrity risk?

The investigators are concerned that if we lose a case based on the Horizon integrity, we'll be ina
world of trouble. They have also been getting queries from solicitors during case briefings. So this
is still very much in the spotlight and not going away.

Kind Regards,
