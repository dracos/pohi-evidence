 Graham,
 at yesterdays SLT Nigel Viles mentioned that one of the investigators had mentioned concerns re: Horizon
 challenges in one of his cases (this being you I believe). Please see my recent reply to the team on this matter. If
 however you need further and specific support please let Jason/myself know or if required contact Dave K.
 Rgds,

 Andy

 Andrew,
 Sue Lowther's team have reviewed this on behalf of Security and will be producing a briefing summary for the
 stakeholders. In essence it will state that there are no underlying issues or trends identified regarding the Horizon
 challenges to date and that we will continue to 'manage' each case as and when further challenges arise. This is also
 the recommendation from the Legal team in that if we carry out a 'drains up' exercise we are leaving ourselves open
 to an even greater risk of challenge (i.e. in simple terms: why are you looking if you say everything is okay!).

                                                                                                                     POLOO175972




Jason/Andrew:
However and from a fraud casework perspective can you ensure that all case challenges/issues moving
forward are captured, monitored and reviewed (please liaise with the casework team).

Dave,
Following our previous discussions not sure where you are with this, spoke to Sue last week re: producing the
summary report for stakeholders.
Rgds,

Andy

Hi All,

Have you guys heard anything from the PO executive on the Horizon integrity risk?

The investigators are concerned that if we lose a case based on the Horizon integrity, we'll be in a
world of trouble. They have also been getting queries from solicitors during case briefings. So this
is still very much in the spotlight and not going away_




Kind Regards,

Andrew Daley                                                              Security V Problem Solved
