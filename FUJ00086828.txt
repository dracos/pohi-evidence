[Besides the instance of the screen 'freezing' this morning at 11:50am I've established from previous calls that there were other

instances on 2nd April between 10 and 10:30am and also at around 10am on 26th March as well. The counter application event log
nly covers the April instances and in both cases there are a number of CNIM events written around the time indicating problems
ith the connection. Checking through the whole log there are in fact a high number of these events. Passing call through to Chris

\Hawkes so a thorough check can be done on the cause of these events.

iI think there are two interacting problems here:

i) branch appears to have some sort of intermittent comms problem - if this can be resolved it may be the fastest way to help the PM.
[There have been about 20 of these during working hours in the last 4 weeks. The failures are transient and the connection is normally
restored quite quickly.

i) when a failure does occur, on several occasions CNIM has attempted to update the OnlineStatus object but has got a Riposte lock
jerror. The counter then hangs - the timer which should timeout the NB application after 32 seconds does not kick in, After 6 or 7
jminutes CNIM appears to retry the connection. If this is ok the Request is sent (much too late!) and the counter application times out,

iRiposte locks have caused problems elsewhere in the past; I will check to see whether other branches are getting similar problems.
iCNIM code needs to be checked to see if it can behave better in this situation.

if the PM phones in again with the same problem DO NOT ADVISE HER TO REBOOT unless the counter has already been
hanging for more than 10 minutes. In most cases it will free itself within this time, and there will be less disruption than a reboot will
lcause. We are continuing to investigate. i

imessages going out of the diehl driver between 09:08:47.903 and 09:08:48.023, (to the 4 cor servers) but no sign of a response from

he datacentre. The ISDN call, which was first established at 09:06:48.982 was hung up at 09:09:41.029 with no errors. The A3 was

ritten to the messagestore at 08:09:03 (datacentre time), but I need to try and find out how far the clocks between the branch and
the Datacentre are before being able to decide whether this was within the 32 second timeout period...

carry user data) until 14:59:00 - i.e. 15 seconds later. All 4 of the R1 copies were transmitted within I second. The delay in call

ithin a second or so of the time it was written in the message store, so it looks as though the Rls did NOT reach the datacentre.

IHowever there are smaller packets (150-250bytes) going in both directions before and after the crtical messages. This is beginning to
look to me like a congestion issue further up the network (probably UPSTREAM of the DLE).

There is a problem which is causing system freezes during banking transactions at many Bronze branches if the comms are
intermittent. The system hangs for several minutes, and the clerk may decide to reboot, or be advised to by the helpdesk. The
problem just affects the gateway counters.

jThe R1 request priority message is written. The counter tries to connect to the data centre but the connection fails. The event logs
‘show several CNIM events, followed by a Riposte ‘timeout waiting for lock’ event. Then C_HV_POSCH reports that it couldn't
jupdate the WANStatus object.

IThe counter becomes unresponsive. The banking timer, which should time out the request after 32 seconds, doesn't kick in. If the
iclerk doesn't reboot, the counter usually wakes up again after 5-8 minutes. At this point the banking transaction is timed out.

{The comms problems at some Bronze branches are being investigated on call PC0145212. This call has been raised to find out why
ithe Riposte lock is being held and why the counter then hangs - and eventually recovers.

ery hard to tell when this problem started, but I think it goes back to at least Sept 2006. While it is very inconvenient for the
ffected branches, few of them are continually badly affected by it.

‘One thing I've noticed: ETopUp requests don't hit this problem, but NB and Debit Card do, whenever CNIM Failure mode is set to
lost connection when trying to send the request.

jot quite sure where this call should go. The banking EMV code may be implicated. CNIM manages the connection or failure to
onnect. C_ HV_POSCH (a counter agent) reports the failure to update the object. Riposte is holding the lock (but I suggest we only
[raise this with Escher as a last resort).

il have discussed this with Gareth and we are unsure what is triggering the counter to wake up again after 5-8 minutes. As the 30.
second timer in the Counter Code is not triggered, the Counter development team is unable to shed any light on the matter.

[An example of the problem can be seen in the application event log at 11:51:27 on 12/04/07, where Riposte logs:
"An unexpected error occurred while attempting to modify an entry in the run map. Timeout occurred waiting for lock.
0xC 1090003)"
At the same time, Counter Call Scheduler logs:
"Timeout occurred waiting for lock."
hile attempting to write the NetworkState message to the message store.

‘e have seen the Riposte Timeout message before but are not aware of an explanation from Escher as to the root cause. I'll check
ith Mike Coon on his return next week.

\Perhaps CNIM could have a quick look at the problem to see if they are able to shed any light on what is waking up after 5-8
inutes and advise if this time is configurable.

\On Gareth's suggestion, I am returning this Peak for onward routing to CNIM.

can see that comms fail between 10:38 and 10:51.

iCNIM has set a test timer of 787 (13 mins 7 seconds) and will not test the line during that time. Something else causes the line to
‘come up during that time (10:57) CNIM tests the line and the ping works.

(One thing of note is the very long ping reply times which indicate poor comms.

il suspect CNIM is working as planned where it is required initially to wait 5-15 minutes before testing the line.

il think that Kath Greenwood forgot to "check with Mike Coon on his return next week", not that I can shed any deep light on the
problem.

IExcept on the matter of timeouts.

1) The primary timout of 32 seconds that Anne Chambers mentions is unfortunately not independent of the Riposte "Notify" (of the
rival of the [A3]) process. The timeout period is a parameter to that call, so if Riposte hangs, possibly "waiting for lock", then
maybe the 32-second timeout is also suppressed, leading to the counter freeze. (I happen to be looking into this area for the HNG-
/Horizon hybrid with PCI per CP4305. That version won't use Notify and will therefore have an independent timer.)

2) In addition to the 32 second timeout there is a "600" (probably seconds) timeout for NBRequestReply.dll which is policed by
[BFramework.dll. This has long thought to be dodgy and though it attempts a recovery process to tidy up the transaction it may be
faulty. The ten-minute timeout is set so long to ensure that it is hardly ever allowed to expire. Steve Evans has been studying this, or
related problems under long-standing PEAK 96719 and also 128872 and 134587. However it may be the reason why the counter can

ake up several minutes after the initial freeze.

\Date:04-Jun-2007 17:23:04 User:Mark Scardifield

iI am concerned that this problem is not readily reproducible and any potential (speculative) fix is likely to be fairly invasive. The
ost obvious change would be to introduce a timer that is separate from Notify as suggested by Mike Coon above. This will change

he way that every single on-line transaction is handled so significant testing would be required. Any change to the NB Framework

has to be considered as risky.

iI would like to get a view "pre-RME" whether we would be happy to contemplate this scale of change before we invest more time
land formally propose a change via RMF.

(Date:05-Jun-2007 10:38:38 User:Mike Coon

\A possible alternative to the one suggested above by Mark Scardifield (replacing the Notify timer with an independent one) would bel
‘0 tidy up (one-line code change) NBFramework so that it does not loop when it times out a component. Then we could be justified
in reducing the configured timeout period for NBRequestReply from the present ten minutes to say one minute.

IHowever this timeout is still rather "brutal" and does not provide for any recovery actions such as resetting the PIN pad or
uggesting that the Clerk tells the customer to retrieve their ICC card. This clumsiness may be acceptable for a rare occurrence; it
ican easily be worked around and the PIN pad can be reset by subsequent actions.

{However it is not clear whether the transaction recovery is really adequate in this circumstance. This could be investigated under the
jumbrella of PCI but would have wider relevance than PCI in that it could apply to ETU transactions as well as NBS and DCS.

IBTW it is not understood in EPOSS Dev why this whole problem appears only with Banking transactions. Surely the whole Riposte
jand comms path is identical for ETU? Could it be that ETU transactions are equally implicated but are just not as apparent for some
‘eason?

/Extracts from two mails from Mik Peach of SSC read;

1/ From Mik Peach of SSC to Release Management (for RMF)

For 145617 I accept that we are unlikely to get a fix from Escher, and even if we got one, we are unlikely to implement it. I also

agree that the "brutal" changing of timers is more likely to cause problems than to solve them - so I am in agreement with

idevelopment that they should not attempt to fix the problem. However, even though we know that we can resolve the underlying
etwork problems by switching the site to "always on", there is a cost associated with doing this, and we are trying to migrate sites to
idial-on-demand.I think that the easiest way to handle this is to agree not to produce a fix, but to flag to Graham Welsh and Alex

‘Kemp that there may be an ongoing requirement to "juggle" the networks with problem sites as a result of this decision.

}2/ From Mik Peach of SSC to Graham Welsh (Head of Service Transition) and Alex Kemp (Network Service Manager).
investigation into Peak 145212 and a clone of same (145617) has identified a problem which can cause counters to suffer an
proximate 8 minute "hang" during online transactions. The underlying root causes of this are intermittent network issues on a dial-
n-demand circuit, coupled with a Riposte timer issue. Given that we are unlikely to get a fix from Escher, and even less likely to

implement one even if we got one, and given that the only alternative in the counter code would require a counter release of a fix

described as "brutal", with possible side effects; the SSC recommendation to RMF is that we do not attempt to fix this problem. We
ave a work-round, which is currently to switch any such problem-site out of dial-on-demand to always-on; actually in the case of
ithe specific PO raising the call, we switched them to ADSL. Initial investigation has shown that the problem is affecting 10-12 Post

\Offices, who are getting the symptoms 2-3 times per week.

\For the sites which have this problem, and which remain on ISDN, we will have the alternative of switching to Silver FRIACO.

service type 7) or metered FRIACO (service type 9).
appreciate that BT and POL have been slower than anticipated in the ADSL roll-out, and I understand the pressure to switch to

idial-on-demand. However, I believe that, although there will be a cost to CS in using this workround, it would be more cost-effective}

han the alternatives.
