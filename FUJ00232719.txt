1 Purpose and Scope

This document describes the process for making changes to Horizon System, either Branch Access or
Back End Databases. To ensure that there is transparency around the change activity, that evidence is
provided for the activities completed, approval was granted. All of which require the POL owned Ad-Hoc.
form to be completed and approved by POL appointed teams.

Some changes will also require an elevated level of user access known as APPSUP. Providing the
APPSUP role to the user account, provides the user with full data read and write privileges on all Oracle
databases.

NOTE: OOH will follow the standard OOH process. See Document: SVM/SDM/MAN/2378 — Post Office
Account Operations Duty Manager Handbook

1.1 Description

All issues that require the 3x approval process will be recorded in a POL/FJ bonded TfS Incident. The
Incident will contain the below detail to enable POL to make an approval decision and fill out the POL Ad-
Hoc form.

+ What action needs to be taken

+ If APPSUP access is required by FJ

+ Time frame for task to be completed ie. Monday to Friday 9:00 — 16:00 or after 18:00
+ What steps need to be taken, Plan if required

+ What risks should be understood, if action taken or not taken

+ What action evidence Fujitsu propose to share on completion

Current examples where POL 3x Approvals are required —
+ Assisted rollover, assisting branches to rollover when they are in the incorrect trading period.

+ Modifying or deleting counter data, removing a partially completed transaction, which is locking
a counter.

+ Modifying or deleting files on a back end system, where there is an issue with a file received
from a 3rd party system, which impacts a batch process. It is necessary to delete or modify the
file to allow the batch process to be restarted.

2 Process

Incident is logged in TfS, raised by either POL or Fujitsu. The incident to be investigate must be a
bonded incident.

Fujitsu will investigate and will supply POL with options and suggested recommendations to
resolve the issue.

If APPSUP access is required the incidents Summary and Additional comments in TfS (Visible
to POL) will need to be updated with one of the below.

Elevated access — Assisted Rollover
Elevated access - Counter Data Change (Data centre change to support a counter)
o Elevated access — File Change (Remove or Modify)

°°

o Elevated access — Other

Fujitsu will update the incident and pass back to POL to raise the Ad-Hoc form and gain the 3x
required approvals. Incident must contain details described in Section 1.1 Description

POL will route the incident back to FJ once approvals are obtained with the approvals and Ad-
Hoc form attached to the incident as evidence.

Fujitsu will check the Ad-hoc form with the SME supporting team before requesting Fujitsu
approval.

MAC team will email Senior Service Delivery Manager for approval and CC the CSPOA for
awareness.

Once Fujitsu approval has been received, the incident will be updated to confirm Fujitsu
approval

The Fujitsu MAC team will raise a CTASK for the required SME team to perform Ad-Hoc request
co And pass the bonded incident to the relevant team

If APPSUP is required —

The relevant team will pass the Peak (raised from the bonded incident) to the CSPOA Security
team for APPSUP privileges to be granted.

Information required -
o Username
o Start and Finish Date/Time

CSPOA Security check the TfS incident for agreed POL approvals and if supplied, raise an
internal TfS incident requesting APPSUP access and pass to the UNIX team.

The UNIX team will contact the required user and confirm APPSUP access has been granted

CSPOA Security will update the Peak with the internal TfS reference and Date/Time of granted
access

SME arrange for peer review, peer will also witness actions to be performed — How do we record
this? (SME to state who peered or peer reviewer writes a separate statement? Does this go on
TfS CTASK or Peak?)

SME supporting team perform actions detailed on the CTASK, whilst capturing evidence of the
pre and post implementation states, alongside the committed actions. Evidence to be added to
the CTASK, MAC team will add to the TfS bonded incident. Ideally screenshots, along with
statements and execution spooled to a log file.

See examples in section B Appendix — Evidence Examples

Once actions completed, User with granted access will contact the UNIX team for access to be
revoked.

The Unix team will update the TfS internal incident and pass back to the CSPOA security team
CSPOA Security will update Peak with the time the access was revoked.

CSPOA Security close the TfS internal incident

SME close the Peak with comments, action completed, or further action required for monitoring.
SME close the CTASK checking evidence has been attached

Bonded incident with evidence is passed back to POL to review and confirm incident closure.

If APPSUP is Not required -

SME supporting team perform actions detailed on the CTASK, whilst capturing evidence of the
pre and post implementation states, alongside the committed actions. Evidence to be added to
the CTASK, MAC team will add to the TfS incident. Ideally screenshots, along with statements
and execution spooled to a log file.

See examples in section B Appendix — Evidence Examples
Peak Closed with comments, action completed, or further action required for monitoring.
Bonded incident with evidence is passed back to POL to review and confirm incident closure.
