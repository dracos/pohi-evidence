Subject: RE: GLO sub-committee

Thanks Tom. The legal team are working up ail the documents so that Al and I can review before the Board
SubCommittee. We are trying to arrange a Board SubCommittee on Wednesday morning (13") to ensure the timings
work as you have set out. Tim is at an all day National Trust event but we are liaising with his PA now. We will revert
back once we have coordinated diaries.

See you at the People Awards!

Kind regards
Ben

Ben
We discussed timetable with Rod and HSF yesterday. Rod can explain the details but the upshot is that we need to have
a Board approved number to work with internally by 14th Nov which means we need a subcommittee on 13" at the

latest.

The subcommittee will also need to approve the CFO letter we need on funding as well as consider the merits opinion,
financial analysis and bottom up (Part 36) analysis as this will form the pack that we will be submitting to Ministers.
