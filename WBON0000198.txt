Dear Mark,

As part of the Post Office litigation we are drafting witness statements in response to allegations made by the other
side. I have been in contact with Paul Smith, who has pointed me in your direction in relation to one of the issues we
need to respond to.

Jason Coyne, the Claimants' IT expert, refers to an audit document produced by E&Y in 2011 (see attached) which
identified issues with the credence application, namely weak change controls within the back end of the systems
allowing Logica developers (the third-party provider) to move their own uncontrolled changes into the production
environment. He goes on to say that "further documentation to approve fixes and patches applied to Credence outside
of the release process were lacking, therefore linking changes to issue tickets to record the original request for the bug
fix was not possible".

We need to understand whether these comments are correct and whether anything changed in light of the report.

As we need this information urgently, can you let me know if you are the right person to answer this and if so, can we
set up a call for later today/tomorrow morning to discuss?

Kind regards,

Lucy
