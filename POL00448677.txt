Hi Henry,

J agree, I thought he was in a better place, but I saw him very angry with surprises with NBIT
costs late on Thursday.

I cannot imagine he’s going to want to stay, his notes were quite clear that he’s had enough; he’s
done waiting and doesn’t feel he’s had the support nor that it’s going to change soon enough
(neither do we). I would expect him to want to agree an exit date with you. I anticipate this
being towards the end of this calendar year/December to give you time to find a successor/ him
time to find another role.

I might be wrong, let’s hope I am, but if he does want to leave, we will need to think about how
maintain his motivation and commitment during that period.

Talk later,
Jane

Jane ,

I am also not clear on the nature of the advice to him .

He has moved on very much from my chat with him on Thursday . I had hoped he would give
me time to get Tom off the Board and to change the way NEDs act ie working through the EDs
and being less “ executive * .

Have we reached the end for Nick or do you sense I can talk him round ?

Morning Henry,

Ibe in at 9.30ish, be good to talk to you at 10am when you arrive. I’ll ask Di to put time in.
Also, I’ve asked Di to arrange a meeting at 12 with you and Nick, I've suggested I attend too.

Thinking about his comment ‘I’ve taken advice’, I’m unsure whether he means friendly or legal
advice. If it’s legal, I’m guessing he’s going to argue there’s a fundamental breakdown of trust
and confidence in the Board and the Shareholder. My instinct he will want us to agree terms of
a departure today and timing, I don’t believe Nick would want to leave immediately. He may
also be wanting good leaver status and a‘deal’. Would be good to discuss the merits of this
and the approach, when speak at 10am.

Speak later.
Regards,
Jane

Hi Henry,

Please see Nicks note Teams below. He's confirmed he's happy for you to share this with the
NEDs as he feels they need to understand the situation. He has a GE meeting at 10.30, he said
he'd be free at 12 to 2pm to meet you. I'll ensure this is booked in your diary, I will ensure I am
free to attend/support.

Jane, This situation has now moved beyond a Sunday evening chat. My patience has expired. There has been no
progress since we discussed the matter over Teams on 13/01. You have now forced me to seek advice, which I
have done this weekend. I think you and Henry have some urgent thinking to do or, to quote Henry, ‘we will end up
in a real self made mess’. Nick

Regards,
Jane
