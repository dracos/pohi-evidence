Problem Summary

2010 Local Suspense data has been retained for 14 branches

Problem Description

Call was passed to Fujitsu after investigation by NBSC.

The branch had balanced their single stock unit at the end of TP 10
and moved a loss of £39.57 into the Local Suspense account. They
then had to clear Local Suspense before completing the balance, but
the amount to be cleared was £9839.45, £9799.88 higher than
expected. The Suspense Account report showed this figure brought
forward from the previous TP, but the corresponding report for the
previous period did not show this amount carried forward.

When the TP9 Suspense Account report was provided, the branch
mentioned that they had had the same problem last February, and
provided the TP10 2012 report to confirm this. This showed the same
brought forward figure of £9799.88. SSC did not receive a call about
this last year.

Cause of the problem: some data from autumn 2010 has been
retained in one of the database tables, for 14 separate branches.
These branches will all have been affected by this problem late 2011
and late 2012, though in some cases the amounts involved are small.
