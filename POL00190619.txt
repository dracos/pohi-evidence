Indeed, but what expectation of privacy do we have when we:
- participate in a review conducted with an MP;
- which arose as a response to adverse publicity; and

- which we expressly acknowledged that the findings would be published?

Hugh

You are right that with a company it would more usually be a question of confidentiality, and I mentioned this to Rodric as
something we should keep in mind. However, there was a case back in 2000, in fact which one of my colleagues was connected
with, which made clear that a company could sue for an unwarranted infringement of privacy. This particular case was in the
context of secret filming by the BBC and a complaint made to the then Broadcasting Standards Commission ("BSC") which was
upheld.

In this case, on an application by the BBC to the High Court for judicial review, and in the context of the European
Convention on Human Rights, the High Court ruled in favour of the BBC, its reasoning being based on a finding that
privacy could only be applied to individuals and not companies. The Court of Appeal then reversed this decision and
held that the BSC was entitled to uphold privacy complaints by companies, as a company does have activities of a
private nature which may need protection from unwarranted intrusion. By way of example, the Court of Appeal said that
it would be a departure from proper standards to listen clandestinely to, or to record secretly, a board meeting or to
broadcast private correspondence.

Hi Hugh
it usually applies to individuals, but could also apply to a company.

Thanks Susan
Stupid question but does privacy only attach to individuals or can it apply to companies in any way?

Dear Susan and Hugh
You have asked for my opinion as to whether we can obtain an injunction in relation to the Second Sight report.

The availability of an interim injunction to restrain a defendant from publication of a defamatory document pending trial is
much more restricted in defamation cases and the courts have consistently demonstrated a reluctance to grant interim
injunctions. Even where it can be shown that there is a clear intention to publish a defamatory statement, English case
law makes it clear that an injunction can only be granted in relation to defamation cases where it can be shown that the
statement is unarguably defamatory, there are no grounds for concluding that the statement may be true, and there is no
other defence which might succeed. This has been well established as being a relatively low hurdle for any defendant to
overcome and, in effect, has meant that wherever a defendant says that they will justify any defamatory comments made
in a document to be published, or during a proposed broadcast or in a proposed article, an injunction will be refused. This
is, in essence, because of the importance attached to the right of free speech. The situation is somewhat different where
clear issues of confidentiality and privacy are involved and if it can be shown that there is threatened publication of
private or confidential information.

Kind regards
Susan
