The focus of Release Management is the protection of

the live environment.

POL00337654
POL00337654

Current Way of Working

Each change has it’s own unique release with multiple
deployments occurring on a regular basis

No regular schedule of changes

Projects work independently of each other vying for a
deployment date

Postmasters receiving frequent changes to counters

Increased risk of operational impact

POL00337654
POL00337654

What is it?

managing, planning, scheduling, and controlling the rollout of IT DEPLOYM ENT F scHEDULING

The Vision

To establish a proactive Release Model for Horizon Changes
(into Live), ensuring priority Horizon changes are delivered.

By collating changes into a single release, controlled through
the central release schedule, the risk to bra operations al I
will be reduced by decreasing the number of unique tf ©
deployments. s c

The process ensures that all testing, communication, and
deployment mechanisms are in place, and in line with those
tested prior to deployment of new or modified functionality. i?

Ownership of the process includes moving the
responsibility for the Release Forum from suppliers back to
Post Office, meeting weekly with project and service
providers to review and manage release requirements and
scheduling.
