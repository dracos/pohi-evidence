engaged by Fujitsu Services (or its HNG-X Sub-contractors) to deliver Project
HNG-X who would have continued to work on Project HNG-X had it not ceased
in accordance with paragraph 1.1, an amount equal to the charges that would
have been payable by Post Office to Fujitsu Services for work performed in
accordance with the HNG-X Programme Plan by that individual according to the
rates set out in the table in paragraph 2.2 of Schedule D8 (assuming 7.4 hour
days), if work had continued on Project HNG-X after the date that this Part C

Fujitsu Services Group (as the case may be) or (ii) the relevant
engagement terminated, in each case Fujitsu Services having taken

terminating the relevant engagement (and procuring its HNG-X Sub-
contractors do the same),

HNG-X T&M Budget for such work for the relevant period as set out in the
budget report to be delivered in accordance with paragraph 11 of Sub-schedule

Conditionality Period (taking account of pre-payments, credits and discounts
applicable under this Agreement),

(the “Contract Reversal Adjusted Charge”).
If the Contract Reversal Adjusted Charge is:

3.3.1. greater than the Contract Reversal Initial Charge, Post Office shall pay to
Fujitsu Services an amount equal to the difference; or

3.3.2 less than the Contract Reversal Initial Charge, Fujitsu Services shall allow an
amount equal to the difference as a credit against Charges payable by Post
Office.

The amount (if any) payable by Post Office pursuant to paragraph 3.3.1 shall be
invoiced to Post Office by Fujitsu Services in the same manner as any other Charge
invoiced in accordance with Schedule 9 of Baseline 7 and, subject to paragraph 3.5,
such invoice shall be paid by Post Office within 30 days of receipt.

Should any part of the amount invoiced under paragraph 3.4 be subject to a Dispute,
then Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to be paid for that part not in dispute (including
any part in respect of which such Dispute is subsequently resolved) and which has been
agreed with Post Office and Post Office shall pay such amount within 30 days of receipt
of a valid invoice raised under paragraph 3.4.

For the avoidance of doubt, amounts duly paid to Fujitsu Services under Schedule D&
for HNG-X Development and Associated Change Development and Schedule D7 for
Migration during the Conditionality Period shall not be taken into account in calculating
the amount of the Contract Reversal Adjusted Charge and shall not, by virtue of this
Part C taking effect, be liable to be repaid, and all further amounts payable by Post
Office in accordance with those Schedules for work performed or equipment supplied
during the Conditionality Period shall not, by virtue of this Part C taking effect, cease to
be payable.

Reinstatement

Fujitsu Services shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following this Part C taking
effect, take all necessary steps to reverse the effect of any testing or implementation of
the HNG-X Service Infrastructure (save to the extent that Post Office shall have elected
to continue with the installation of such Infrastructure in accordance with paragraph 1.2
of this Part C). Post Office shall reimburse to Fujitsu Services all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by Fujitsu Services in performing its obligations under this paragraph.
Fujitsu Services shall raise invoices in accordance with Schedule D2 for such costs and
expenses as they arise.

Further Assurance

Each Party agrees that it shall do all such things as may reasonably be required to give
effect to the provisions of this Part C. Post Office shall reimburse to Fujitsu Services all

Part C takes effect, agree and execute a revised version of this Agreement reflecting all
the changes to be made pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Part C and any other necessary
changes consequent upon the completion or continuing implementation of the

“Feasibility Work" shall have the meaning set out in paragraph 6.3 of

Schedule 10;
“Aggregate Charges" shall have the meaning set out in paragraph 6.2.11 of

Schedule 10;
44 The value of the Core SI Services provided by Fujitsu Services to Post Office in relation

45

6.2.2

6.2.11

to such Pre-paid SI Capacity shall be calculated on a time cost basis in the same way
and at the same rates as it is calculated for Additional Resources in paragraph 6.2.1
without application of the discounts and rebates referred to in paragraph 6.2.2. This
value of Core SI Services shall be adjusted to reflect any applicable discount for
Feasibility Work as described in paragraph 6.3.

Unless otherwise agreed in accordance with paragraph 11.16 of Schedule 20, if the
value of Core SI Services (calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.4) provided in a
Work Period exceeds the Pre-paid SI Capacity for that Work Period, the amount of such
excess shall be charged to Post Office on the basis described in paragraph 6.2.

Post Office shall receive the following discounts on, and rebates against, the Additional
SI Charges payable in accordance with paragraph 6.2.1:

6.2.2.1 if any Additional Resource in respect of which the Additional SI Charges
referred to in paragraph 6.2.1 apply was used by Post Office in relation to
Feasibility Work then the Additional SI Charges shall be reduced by an
amount (if any) calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.3;

6.2.2.2 Post Office shall receive a discount of 20% on the Additional SI Charges as
adjusted in accordance with paragraph 6.2.2.1 (or if no such adjustment
applies as calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.2.1); and

6.2.2.3 Post Office shall be entitled to a rebate against the Additional SI Charges in
accordance with paragraph 6.2.11.

Post Office shall be entitled to a rebate against Additional SI Charges if in respect of any
Financial Year such charges (calculated as if the Additional SI Charges payable by Post
Office in respect of that Financial Year were the Additional SI Charges as adjusted
pursuant to paragraph 6.2.2.1, but without any discount pursuant to paragraph 6.2.2.2)
("Aggregate Charges") fall within one of the thresholds set out in the following table:

Aggregate Charge Thresholds Rebate Percentage

£5,000,001 to £7,500,000 2.5%
£7,500,000 to £10,000,000 5.0%
Over £10,000,000 75%

Schedule A6 Version 13.0
Page 10 of 11
CONFIDENTIAL

6.3

6.3.1

Such rebate (if any) shall be the rebate percentage (which corresponds to the threshold
above in which the Aggregate Charges fall) of the Aggregate Charges and shall be
issued to Post Office by Fujitsu Services as a credit against the Additional SI Charges
payable by Post Office in respect of that Financial Year.

Additional Discounts in relation to Feasibility Work

If in any Financial Year the services of the Core SI Team or Additional Resource are
used by Post Office in relation to feasibility studies which the Parties have agreed under
a Work Order to undertake as part of the Strategic Approval Stage and/or the Start-up
and Feasibility Stage of the Development Process ("Feasibility Work") then the value of
the Core SI Services calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.4 and/or the Additional
SI Charges payable in accordance with paragraph 6.2.1 above (as the case may be)
shall be reduced by an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:

RA (£) = {N / 4} (where the outcome of {N / 4} is rounded down to the nearest whole
number) xR

where:

RA= Reduced amount in respect of a particular Professional Service Grade category
(as set out in paragraph 6.2.1) in relation to Core SI Services and/or Additional
Resource.

N= Total number of working days (as described in paragraph 6.2.5), in whole or in
part, of Feasibility Work undertaken by all individuals in the Professional Service
Grade category referred to in RA.

R= Rate per working day (as described in paragraph 6.2.1) for the Professional
Service Grade category referred to in RA.

The above formula shall be applied in respect of each applicable Professional Service
Grade category such that the total reduction to the value of the Core SI Services and/or
Additional SI Charges shall equal the sum of the reduced amounts (RA) for each
applicable category.
