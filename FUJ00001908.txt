Bank_Transaction_Id

Message sequence number assigned by the message originator
(except Horizon), to assist in identifying a transaction uniquely.
Stays unchanged through the life of the transaction.

C4 Processing Date

Transaction highlighted and notified to the DRS. From a system perspective, a
‘D’ transaction.
Exception Types Within all reports the ‘Exceptions’ category will include:

¢ ‘Incomplete States’, i.e. those transactions where one or more
transaction component is missing — a C4 without a C12 ete

e Genuine exceptions where transaction components belonging

POL FS Transactions

From a Branch / Post Office Ltd. perspective, a transaction that
has been sent from TPS to Post Office Ltd. POL FS. From a
system perspective, a ‘C112’ transaction.

Receipt Date

Receipt Date is the Date as printed on the transaction Receipt at
the Counter. It forms part of all transactions.

Receipt Time

Receipt Time is the Time as printed on the transaction Receipt at
the Counter. It forms part of all transactions.

Reconciliation Date

The Reconciliation Date is the date attributed to a transaction to
allow Post Office Ltd. to reconcile. It will be set the first available
Bank Settlement date from the transaction elements (C112, C12,
C4, S & D) that make up a Network Banking transaction. If no
Bank Settlement date is available, the Reconciliation Date will be
set to the processing date that the Data Reconciliation Service
first recorded any element of the transaction being received. If a
Settlement date subsequently becomes available, the first
available Bank Settlement date will replace the processing date.
However, once a transaction has been accounted for on the
reconciliation reports, the Reconciliation Date will never change.

Routing Gateway

Identifies a system, where the authorisation for a specific
transaction should be sought.

Run Date

This is the System Processing Date for which the report refers,
ie. all transaction components processed by the DRS on System
Processing Date dd/mm/yyyy are accounted for on this report.

Settlement Date

Settlement Date is often the same as Run Date but some Financial
Institutions may assign a Settlement Date in the future: e.g. the
following Monday may be set on transactions processed on the
preceding Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

RECONCILIATION REPORT!
Version: 7.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 15/11/04
1.0 Introduction
This document has been compiled to specify all Fujitsu Services outputs from the
Data Reconciliation Service (DRS) to enable a generic end to end reconciliation of
Network Banking transaction processing.
2.0 Scope

This document defines the format and content of all reconciliation reports for S80

Impact (post migration), which satisfies the Network Banking reconciliation

requirement including NBS, DCS and ETS. It does not attempt to define within the

operating systems how the transactions are processed.

The following Network Banking requirements are satisfied by this document:

* Reconciliation: [NBR0040], [NBR0042], [NBR0183], [NBR0212], [NBR0227],
[NBR0229], [NBR0278], [NBR0294], [NBR0389].

¢ Settlement: [NBR0230], [NBR0456].

e Error Resolution: [NBR0260]

It is assumed that each of the Post Office Ltd. clients, as dictated by Routing Gateway
(assumed to be at this point the Banks / LINK) will require a separate reconciliation

report set.

Within this report set, separate reports will be provided as per the following table:

Report Number Deposit Transactions [__ Withdrawal Transactions
NBIOL Combined Report
NB102 Combined Report

NBO000 is a combined report for all Routing Gateways.

The format and content of each client’s report is considered to be identical when
allowing for these specific requirements. It should therefore be understood that the
specifications documented here are applicable to each client report set (specific client
requirements outside of this reporting specification are not covered within this
document)

There must be a separate set of reports to provide for transactions for which the
Routing Gateway and/or Transaction Type is not known.

Balance Enquiries and PIN changes are explicitly excluded from the report set as ‘Not
Required by Post Office Ltd.’

No report will mix currency, so if ever the transactions selected to appear on a set of
reports are not of a single currency, then a separate set of reports will be produced for

Rows and columns are described in detail, together with the mathematical calculations
required to achieve reconciliation.

All general aspects relating to the production and transmission of the reports are
described.

This document does not attempt to define the business processes undertaken within
Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd. with respect to the resolution of any exceptions,
which may arise, nor does it scope the requirement for any systems that may be
required to assist in this process. This information can be found in the associated
documents, reference:

NB: It should be noted that where a system ‘State’ definition is quoted, this takes
precedence over any narrative which has only been provided to help understand the
business processes.

3.0 General Report Specifications

A separate set of reports is produced for each Post Office Ltd. client as identified by
the Routing Gateway (LINK being a single client). The specification is general to all
Teports sets.

1.

For volumes and values the accounting sense for reporting purposes to allow
settlement totals to be correctly derived, will be:

Absolute volume

Net value

Where no value reported show “0.00”

Where no volume reported show 0

-ve values will be shown in brackets e.g. (nnn.nn)

Each report will show the following general information:

Report title — including the client name (derived from Routing Gateway.)
Transaction Type — (if applicable)

Report ‘Run Date’ - i.e., the period for which the report refers
Production date and time

Fujitsu Services report number

Fujitsu Services reference

Where ‘Received’ and ‘Reconciliation Date’ are quoted against time parameters:

“Received = New’: defines transactions that have had a change of state since
they were last reported, or have never been reported, except in NB102 section
6

“Received = Old’: defines transactions that have NOT had a change of state
since they were last reported

Reports: NB000, NB101 and NB102 will be produced DAILY. They will be
delivered by 08.00hrs the day following the Run Date to:

Post Office Ltd. / POL FS gateway: The Host writes the reports to a directory.
These are picked up by FTMS and posted to the POL FS gateway (as per
other Host to external systems applications).

5. Within report NB 102 the ‘Exceptions’ category will include:
e ‘Incomplete States’, ie. those transactions where one or more transaction
component is missing — a C4 without a C12 etc
e Genuine exceptions where transaction components belonging to the same high
level transaction have been exceptioned, e.g. C12 (amount) not = to C4
(amount).
e Transaction corruptions

6. For clarity within this document, field sizes are shown within ‘Report Layout’ and
not within the ‘Data Definition’

7. All reports are run against a consistent data set.

8. All reports will be produced as ASCII text files — one for each report. The report
layout will be fixed format with space characters providing the blank space. This
will allow for ‘Excel’ input, using fixed field width facilities. The formatting
(lines & shading referred to in this document) will not be included within the file.
Every line will have the character ‘newline’, Hex '0A', as the last character. Each
report will have the text “End of Report” as the last line.

3.2 NB101: Network Banking Settlement Statement

This report identifies ‘C4’ transactions received against each ‘C4 Settlement Date’ as
reported to the DRS for the most recent processing date. The report will be used by
Post Office Ltd. as a basis for settlement of Network Banking transactions with the
Financial Institutions.

3.2.1 NB101: Rules

NB101 is run daily

2. NB1O1 is repeated for each Routing Gateway

3. NBI101 will show ‘C4’ transactions received for ONE day only — breaking these
down into individual ‘C4 Settlement Dates’ There will be one line for each ‘C4
Settlement Date’

4. NBI101 will show Deposit and Withdrawal transactions in separate columns,
(headed ‘Receipts’ and ‘Payments’ respectively) derived from ‘Txn_Type’

5. NB1O1 will show a final settlement column derived in the following way:
¢ Volume: Volume of Deposits plus Volume of Withdrawals
e Value: Value of Deposits minus Value of Withdrawals
e Where the net total is negative i.e. the Value of Withdrawals exceeds the

Value of Deposits, the total will be shown as (xxx.xx)

6. Where the volume for a given ‘C4 Settlement Date’ is nil, the date will not be
reported.

7. ‘C4 Settlement Dates’ are shown in reverse chronological order.

8. Where there is more than one institution with the same Routing Gateway, the

values for the institutions will be shown individually provided the transaction

volume for that institution is greater than zero.

NB102: Exception Summary

This report is divided into twelve sections:

Section 1: All Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & POL FS exceptions
Section 2: Uncleared Exceptioned Client Transactions

Section 3: Uncleared corruptions

Section 4: Uncleared Timing Differences

Section 5: Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & POL FS exceptions >24 hours
Section 6: Uncleared Future Dated Transactions by Client

Section 7: All Cleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & POL FS exceptions
Section 8: Cleared Exceptioned Client Transactions

Section 9: Cleared corruptions

Section 10: Cleared Timing Differences

Section 11: Cleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & POL FS exceptions >24 hours
Section 12: Cleared Future Dated Transactions by Client

Liability _issues_are_not covered within this document, nor_are_the business
processes involved in the resolution of any exception.

NB102: Rules

NB102 is run daily

NB102 is repeated for each Routing Gateway.

For each report section, the column ‘Values’ will be partitioned into 8 sub
columns to contain the values for: ‘C12’, ‘S’, ‘C4’, ‘C112’ & the four values from
a ‘D’ which are: Amount Requested, Amount Authorised, Amount Confirmed,
Amount Discrepancy. The reports will populate all values that are available.

For reporting purposes, within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 & 11, the
column headed ‘CAP’ will be blank.

For reporting purposes within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, the column
headed ‘Discrepancy Type’ will report the ‘D’ discrepancy type.

Where no ‘D’ transaction element has been received, the ‘Discrepancy Type’ will
be blank

Where an exception is set to F99 by Fujitsu Services , clearance of this exception
within the appropriate NB102 section, (e.g. section 2 exceptions shown as cleared
within section 8), will always refer to the previously reported state regardless of
any change of state which may have occurred within the DRS.

All Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & POL FS exceptions are reported as
summary totals by exception type - (NB102 section 1)

Uncleared Exceptioned Client Transactions are listed individually - (NB102
section 2)

Cleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & POL FS exceptions >24 hours are listed

individually — (NB102 section 11)

Cleared Future Dated Transactions are reported as summary totals by Client

identified by Routing Gateway — (NB102 Section 12)

Within each section, exception summary totals / individual transactions are to be

grouped and sub totalled by reconciliation date with a total provided for the entire

section.

For reporting purposes:

¢ Timing Differences: relate to differences in the reconciliation date / settlement
date allocated where a settlement date on a transaction element is not the same
as the reconciliation date first reported on that transaction.

e Future Dated Transactions: relate to those transactions that have a
Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run Date of the report. For example, most
Clients will settle Friday, Saturday and Sunday transactions on the following
Monday. This means that each transaction completed on these days will have a
Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run Date of the report. These transactions
are expected to clear naturally once the Reconciliation Date and the Run Date
are in sync, however in the rare eventuality that a Reconciliation Date is
considerably ahead of the Run Date, Post Office Ltd. may wish to clear the
exception manually. In this case, Fujitsu Services will set the transaction to
“F99’.

For reporting purposes, within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 the

column headed ‘Transaction Type’ will be populated by the following codes:

03 - Withdrawal; Magstripe & PIN Verification (NBS)

04 - Withdrawal with balance; Magstripe & PIN Verification (NBS)

05 - Withdraw Limit; Magstripe & PIN Verification (NBS)

13 - Withdrawal; Signature Verification (NBS)
