POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

1. Introduction

1.1. Purpose

The purpose of this Post Office Account major incident procedural document is solely to supplement the
major incident processes defined in the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management Systems Major Incident
Procedure with any Post Office Limited specific requirements or requests.

This document outlines the management guidelines to be used for Major Incidents impacting the live
estate in communicating with Post Office Limited.

1.2 Owner

The owner of the Major Incident Management process at the local POA level is the Fujitsu POA Senior
SDM, Problem and Major Incident.

2 Guidelines and Interfacing to Post Office

2.1 Guidelines

It is important to maintain a balance between:
a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer

c) Assessing which incidents are major

2.2. Interfacing to Post Office

« During the MAC Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 20:00, Saturday 08:00 — 17:00) and Bank
Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding Christmas Day. The MAC should be the first point of operational
contact between Fujitsu and the Post Office Service Desk. The SMC are responsible for
escalation of incidents to the POA OOH Duty Manager. The POA OOH Duty Manager may
initiate communications with the Post Office OOH Duty Manger. The SMC operate on a 24 x7 x
365 basis.

e Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the MAC team is handed over to the
SMC outside the MAC Core Hours, with the exception of the above.

e The relevant technical teams who are aware of and monitoring a potential major incident must
call the appropriate Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager out of hours) as soon as possible.
This is not limited to major incidents alone, but applies wherever a state other than Business as
Usual has been detected. The Major Incident Manager must in turn communicate the potential
incident, to the Atos POL Service Desk for awareness and monitoring in Atos POL Post Office.
This is usually done via the MAC team in core hours.

e The Major Incident Manager (or Duty Manager out of hours) is responsible for communicating
both up the Fujitsu organisation and across (see appendix 9.3) to their counterpart in Atos.
Where this is impractical (e.g. leave, out of hours, unavailable), the initiative should be taken to
jump up the organisation. Of prime importance is that the customer is informed in a timely
manner and at the correct touch point. This communication should be by voice or direct SMS.
The communication should include the date, time, name, nature of the incident, priority, if service
affecting, likely impact, and the Fujitsu owner to contact.

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

e The Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager OOH, who covers Monday to Friday 17:30 to 09:00
and from 17:00 Friday though to 09:00 Monday) should also initiate communication using SMS
via the MAC team (see operational hours above.). Outside of these hours the SMS should be via
the SMC. The SMS distribution list used is titled ‘SMS Internal’ and amongst others includes the
appropriate members of the POA Operations Management Team.

3 Post Office Account defining a Major Incident

3.1 Incident Classification

As a general rule a Major Incident will be an incident rated as a Business Critical Incident as shown in the
following

- The ‘CONTRACT’
- Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below.
- POA Operations Incident Management Procedure document (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018).

- A series of connected lower priority incidents which combine to have a significant business
impact.

However not all incidents rated as priority 1 qualify as a Major Incident as the priority levels do not always
reflect the overall business impact to POL. For example a single counter post office which is unable to
trade, regardless of its business volumes, is rated as a priority 1 incident.

For incident classification on Post Office Account refer to the POA Incident Enquiry Matrix
SVM/SDM/SD/0023.

3.2. Influencing Factors in calling a Major Incident

It is important that a Major Incident is defined in accordance with section 3.3 Major Incident Triggers, as
such, because of its business impact on the day when it occurs, rather than simply being defined as a
Major Incident because it appears on a list. However the following parameters will also feed into the
consideration of whether a major incident should be called:

e Duration, i.e. how long has the vulnerability to service already existed?

« Impact across the estate, including consideration of whether a service is merely degraded or
actually stopped

e Time at which the event occurs in relation to the 24 hour business day

e Time of year — e.g. Peak Trading Period, Christmas / Easter / End of month / quarter

Please see below sections for information on Breached Notification to POL controller and EMEIA;.

3.3.7. Breach Notification to POL controller and EMEIA

If the Fujitsu Problem and Major Incident team require to contact the Post Office data protection team,
particularly where root cause analysis of a suspected breach is being undertaken, the email address
}can be used as a point of escalation as this mailbox is continually

monitored.

Data processors (POA and POA sub-processors) must understand what personal data is contained
within any data that has been lost, stolen, altered without permission, been subject to unauthorised
access or is unavailable to the data subject that requires access to it etc.

POL have confirmed that the current Horizon Incident Management Process is to be used in the case of a
suspected GDPR data breach and POL will determine if the incident is a GDPR breach.

In the event of a breach POA are to:
1. Follow the Major Incident Management process as below

2. Make sure if it is deemed a GDPR incident that the Fujitsu EMEIA Security Process is invoked via
this link: EMEIA Breach Notification Policy Link_and ensure that the EMEIA DPO has authorised
a decision to notify POL of a breach before notify POL

3. If instruction to not notify POL by the EMEIA DPO, then do not proceed with notifying POL and
leave as an internal incident.

4. If EMEIA DPO does not provide feedback within the 24 hour window, then proceed with notifying
POL.

5. Immediately (within than 24 hours from discovery) inform POL in order that they can determine if
itis a GDPR breach. POL will notify the ICO and, if appropriate, the impacted data subjects

3.3.8 Recognising a data breach and collecting evidence

How do you decide if it is a suspected data breach? There is a set of criteria defined by the Working
Party 29.

As per the Working Party 29 (Independent European working party that deals with issues related to
protection of privacy and personal data) Guidelines on personal data breach notification, a security
incident falling within one or more of the following categories should be considered a personal
data breach:

4. unauthorised or accidental disclosure of, or access to, personal data (a “Confidentiality
Breach”)

2. unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data (an “Integrity Breach”);

3. accidental or unauthorised loss of access to, or destruction of, personal data (an “Availability
Breach”).

NB: Please refer to the SVM/SEC/MAN/3807 GDPR Directory (Post Office HNG-X Account GDPR
Directory) held in Dimensions, for details of the Working Party 29 Guidelines. Please refer to sections
2.1.2 and 2.1.3 of the GDPR directory.

Additionally, please use the following link
IRRELE'
“Definition of Personal Data Breach.

ind refer to the document

The following information sources identify personal data content:

See ‘GDPR Capability Statements’ for high level information on personal data content defined for
each Business Stream type in POA SharePoint: GDPR Capability Statements

See ‘GDPR Account Data Mapping’ and filter on the personal data and special category data
columns in POA SharePoint. Use this spreadsheet in combination with DES/GEN/SPE/2756
‘Horizon Business Data flows and Interfaces’ in order to see the business flows in context and
understand the interface numbering used in the spreadsheet. This spreadsheet also contains the
names of the interface specifications that hold in detail the data elements within files (POL is yet
to highlight personal data in these POL documents)

See Section 5 of SVM/SEC/MAN/3807 ‘Personal Data Summary’

Post Office are likely to ask POA for technical support in their report of the suspected breach to the ICO.
in at least the following areas:

The nature of the suspected breach — what personal data has been impacted and how
oWho accessed what data (content and artefact e.g. log, data file, device etc.) and when
oWhat category is the suspected data breached

oHow many data subjects are suspected to be impacted and what category are these data
subjects (since Horizon is transaction based it may be difficult to supply the number and
category of data subjects but by inspection of data, where available, a best guess should
be attempted. This may involve ATOS where the data has been collected via AP-ADC at
the counter)

oHow many records are suspected to be involved

oWho are the suspected impacted data subjects

What was done to prevent the suspected breach (security controls in place)
POA Operational Security will guide POA technical teams on gathering the above evidence.

Ensure suspected breaches and evidence collected is recorded (even if POL don't deem the incident as
a GDPR breach). This evidence must be securely stored (encrypted) under the control of POA
Operational Security and must reference the original TfSNow incident.

3.3.9 Who decides if it is a data breach?

Post Office will ultimately determine using the evidence POA supply whether the incident is a GDPR data
breach. Prior to notifying POL and passing POL the evidence POA and EMEIA DPO will analyse the
evidence to determine if a breach has occurred.

See the EMEIA definition of data breach document link below. This document states that ‘only the
EMEIA DPO can authorise a decision to notify’ the controller of a breach

Please see section 2.6 of the document GDPR Directory (SVM/SEC/MAN/3807).

3.4 Major Business Continuity Incidents (MBCI)
For HNG-X the MBCI triggers are listed in:
« _HNG-X Support Services Business Continuity Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0001)
« HNG-X Services Business Continuity Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0002)
* _HNG-X Security Business Continuity Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0031)

These documents should be referred to as appropriate in the event of Major Incident to determine if
Business Continuity needs to be invoked.

4 Calling the Major Incident

During business hours the Major Incident Manager declares and manages the Major Incident (with
handovers to the POA OOH Duty Manager where applicable.)

Where the impact of the incident is not immediately obvious, and it is not clear if a Major Incident should
be called, escalation and discussion with the POA Operations Management Team should occur, and a
collective decision made. If a Major Incident is not called, the incident should be monitored until closure,
to ensure that the impact does not increase to that of a Major Incident.

In the event that multiple services are impacted, multiple Major Incident Managers may be appointed by
any Service Lead or Senior SDM and will remain in their roles until incident closure.

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

Out of hours the POA OOH Duty Manager is responsible for declaring a Major Incident.

Section 8 of this document specifies the roles and responsibilities during a major incident. The Major
Incident Manager, see section 8.2, is referred to the Manage Major Incident Procedure and must
endeavour throughout the life of a major incident to adhere to the principles of that procedure.

5 Process Flow

As stated in section 1.2 Purpose, this Post Office Account Major Incident Procedural document is solely
to supplement the major incident processes defined in the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management
Systems Major Incident Procedure so please refer to the EMEIA procedure and utilise the templates
provided within that procedure. These include the Major Incident Report and e-mail templates.

Section 6.4 of this Post Office Account process details the normal Major Incident Communication Flow
agreed with Post Office

When initiating the Major Incident Report, as required by the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management
Systems Major Incident Procedure, take into consideration the Post Office specific reporting requirements
detailed in the Post Office Major Incident Report Requirements contained in section 6.5 below.

6 Communications

6.1 Technical Bridge

This is a Fujitsu technical conference for Technical experts and SDU's to discuss and analyse the
incident and to formulate an action plan to restore the service to POL without delay. It should enable the
Technical Recovery Manager to baseline the anticipated response, covering resolution, time and
resources required. This will also include the appropriate owning SDU of the service affected by the
Major Incident.

The Technical Bridge will be set up as required by the Major Incident Manager.

Invitations to the Technical Bridge will be via SMS, email or voice. The SMS will be sent to the distribution
list titled “SMS Technical Bridge’. The SMS text will be sent to technical experts on the POA and will
include outline details of the Major Incident. Also dial in details and the start time will be provided as part
of the meeting invitation.

The Technical Bridge will be started at T + 15 from the trigger, and reconvened at regular intervals during
the Major Incident; the exact scheduling will be discussed and agreed at each preceding Major Incident
Call. The timing of “T+15” for calling a Tech Bridge is for IN Hours only. For OOH the Duty Manager will
be contacted (1 hour reasonable endeavours for response).

The Technical Bridge is chaired by the Major Incident Manager with the recovery managed by the
Technical Recovery Manager.

The Major Incident Communications Manager (MICM) is responsible for ensuring that updates, e.g.,
internal POA or SMS messages to a wider audience are provided at regular intervals, ideally every 30
minutes or longer if an appropriate ETA for the next update relevant to the recovery actions is given.

The MICM is also responsible for ensuring that the Major Incident within TfSNOW is updated at regular
intervals throughout the major incident, including relevant Technical Bridge updates, for audit trail and
report writing purposes.

A request for a Technical Recovery Manager (TRM) will be made to the appropriate Service Delivery Unit
or Development Leads, who will appoint the appropriate resource to be the TRM. Ideally this nomination
is made at the start of the Technical Bridge and will be a SME and a person who is expected to drive to
the resolution. Throughout the Technical Bridge and resolution of the incident, the individual may change

during the bridge and evolvement. Also, there is a possibility that the role could be reassigned to different
individuals.

Following each Technical Bridge, it is the responsibility of the TRM to agree any actions as follows
-Recovery / restoration actions (which should normally include the TfSNow Change numbers),
-Service Improvement Plan recommendations
-Risk Register recommendations
-Recommendations for any improvements to KELS / Alerting / Configuration changes

The above will be documented in the Major Incident Report which is produced using the MIR Report
template contained within the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management Systems Major Incident Procedure

6.2 Service Bridge

This is a service focussed call for Service Management (including the Technical Recovery Manager if
appropriate) and POL to discuss the service impact of the Major Incident and to receive updates on the
progress towards resolution. Post Office Major Incident Management may also be the initiators of a
Service Bridge.

The purpose of the Service Bridge is to provide a focussed area from which strategic decisions can be
made regarding a Major Incident.

As a guide the attendance could be made up of the following or their designated representative
depending upon if the incident occurs IN/OOH:

e Post Office (Personnel as instructed by Post Office Major Incident Management or Live Systems
Service Manager)

6.5 Escalation Communication Protocol

The primary principle:

“Up and Across”

Example:

The Major Incident Manager would escalate up to POA Lead SDM, Problem and Major Incident
Management, and across to the Post Office Service Desk.

6.6 Requests to Disable/Re-Enable Training Controls

Training Controls have been added to the HNG-A/X Applications, which control the roles that Counter
Users are able to logon with and the products that they can trade when logged on. Training Controls
manage access in accordance with training curricula data provided by POL's identity management
system. POL have expressed concerns that the training curricula data that they provide could be mis-
entered or corrupted by the systems providing it (supplied by Accenture) so as to cause a
catastrophic/wide-spread loss of access to HNG-A/X Users.

One approach to resolving such a situation would be for POL to Request that POA disabled Training
Controls, completely, and then re-enable the Controls once the training curricula data had been
corrected. Should such a situation arise, it is likely that it would be recognised during a Major Incident
Service Bridge call. Similarly, it would be during a Major Incident Service Bridge call that POL would
decide on Training Controls disablement, over any other courses of action to resolve (e.g. correcting the
data in their identity management system or continuing with limited trading).

N.B. POL requesting us to disable Training Controls during a Major Incident Service Bridge call is NOT
sufficient authorisation to action that request (see below)

6.6.1 Handling Requests to Disable Training Controls

Whilst discussions for requesting disablement of Training Controls might have occurred during a Major
Incident Service Bridge, disablement should not be carried out until a formal authorised request has been
received.

During the Major Incident service bridge call, should the decision be made to disable Training Controls,
the Post Office signatory who will issue the request to disable Training Controls will be identified to
Fujitsu Services. To enable the Post Office signatory to make the request, after the Service Bridge call
POA Duty Manager will send an email to the identified Post Office signatory requiring Post Office to issue
Fujitsu Services with instructions to make a Request to Disable Training Controls and subsequently a
Request to Re-Enable Training Controls.

The email will contain the text below:

If this review highlights areas where improvements can be made, an agreed Service Improvement Plan
will be produced, using the EMEIA SIP template, with appropriate actions, owners and timescales. It will
also identify any ongoing risks to the service, together with any changes. Service Management will track
all actions to resolution. Third party actions will be reviewed at Service Review meetings.

Consideration should be given as to whether the improvements can be shared across Fujitsu as lessons
learnt, in accordance with Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management System document: Major Incident
Process (29/09/2017). These are to be documented on the Lessons Learnt portal to help other Accounts
to learn from the failures or success of the major incident activities. As stipulated in the document, there
may be situations when the lessons cannot be shared due to confidentiality reasons.

Itis important that the number of branches impacted and the duration of the Major Incident is agreed at
the Major Incident Review. This information is required to calculate the impact on Branch and Counter
Availability and any associated Liquidated Damages (LD) liabilities

7.2 The Major Incident Report

A first draft of the Major Incident Report is to be produced within 24 hours and on the approval of the
POA Senior Service Delivery Manager sent to Post Office Service Management.

The first formal version of the Major Incident Report is to be produced within five working days and on the
approval of the POA Senior Service Delivery Manager is sent to Post Office Service Management.
Generally this report will be produced after a Post Incident Review is held and the actions for the Major
Incident Report identified.

If applicable a Problem Record is to be opened for tracking the corrective actions and managed through
the POA Problem Management Process. The formal Major Incident Report version 1.0 is to be attached
to the TfSNow problem record and sent formally for storing in Dimension.

One or more formal versions of the Major Incident Report is to be produced which will also be sent to
either Post Office Service or Problem Management, after the approval of the POA Senior Service
Delivery Manager, providing feedback on the corrective actions. These major incident reports are also to
be attached to the TfSNow problem record and sent formally for storing within Dimensions.

7.3 Calculating potential LD liability for Major Incidents

Major Incidents which qualify as Failure Events are detailed in the Branch Network Service Description
(SVM/SDM/SD/0011). A Failure Event is defined in this document as an event or series of connected
events which causes one or more Counter Positions to be deemed to be Unavailable due to a Network
Wide Failure or a Local Failure. Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part of such a Failure Event until
the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident closure and Major Incident Review process as
detailed in section 6.0.

For a Failure Event the Incident Closure & Major Incident Review Process will require Post Office and
Fujitsu to agree the number of branches and counter positions affected and the duration of the outage
(rounded to the nearest 30 minutes as detailed in the Network Wide Rounding Table).

Network Wide Rounding Table

8.2 Role of the Major Incident Manager

Major Incident Manager (MIM). This will by default be either the Day Time Duty Manager or OOH Duty
Manager (hours shown in 9.3). However a separate member of the Service Management team may be
appointed as the MIM depending on the situation. The primary role of the MIM in a Major Incident is to
facilitate the management of the Incident through investigation and diagnosis to resolution, with the aim
of making the process as efficient and effective as possible. Upon determining that a Major Incident has
been called, a request for a Technical Recovery Manager (TRM) will be made to the appropriate POA
Service Lead or Senior SDM who will appoint one of his team to be the TRM. The Major Incident
Manager acts as the central point for communication and non-technical information flow, allowing the
TRM to focus on the technical situation and the resolution of the Incident. The Major Incident Manager is
also responsible for creating and maintaining all the associated documentation. For the process to be
effective, all updates and information regarding the incident must be fed to the MIM to update the
timelines and report.

The Major Incident Manager:
e Calls and chairs the Technical Bridge

e Has responsibility for creating the Major Incident Report, using the template defined in section9.1
and ensuring that the applicable information is captured.

e Records the Technical Bridge attendees names so they can be documented in the Major Incident
Report.

e Identifies Business and Service impact though discussions with the users, the Post Office
Service Desk and the MAC team — providing this input into the Tech Bridge.

e Distributes the Technical Bridge actions provided by the TRM (if appropriate).

e In conjunction with the TRM considers if escalation into the Corporate Alert process is desirable
and recommends this when required, see section 6.8 above.

e Assists with communication internally within the POA
° Track time lines

« Along with the POA Problem Manager, ensures that the TRM provides regular updates on any
longer term corrective actions

« Following the resolution of the Incident, schedules and chairs the PIR.

8.3 Role of the Technical Recovery Manager

The primary functions of the Technical Recovery Manager are to co-ordinate and manage the restoration
of service, manage the technical teams, and act as the communication point for the technical teams and
third parties. The function will also include managing all longer term technical corrective actions, e.g.
recommendations for improvements to KELs, eventing and configuration.

The Technical Recovery Manager:
e Manages the technical recovery of the Incident — liaising with SDUs and third parties.

« Provides updates on the recovery, when technicians / representatives of technical teams are
unable to attend the Technical Bridge.

e Is the only person to liaise directly with the technical teams, including technical third parties.

e Provides summarised actions from Technical Bridge to the Major Incident Manager, including:
o Current status including impact and risk
o Advising on potential workarounds.
o Planned recovery activities including timelines

o Root Cause Analysis*, corrective actions, and their corresponding action owners and
timelines (where known)

The TRM will be responsible for attending any meetings and providing appropriate root cause analysis
and corrective action detail. This will also include managing any longer term technical corrective actions
that are documented in the Major Incident Report and will include where appropriate:

e Any activities for a Service Improvement Plan

« Any Changes / TfSNow Change references
«Any Risks

e Any Configuration changes

e Any improvements to KELS, alerting and /or events

e Any associated Peak or TfSNow calls

* For Root Cause Analysis refer to the Fujitsu EMEIA Conduct Root Cause Analysis Procedure.

8.4 Role of the Problem Manager

The Problem Manager ensures that corrective actions / investigations are tracked and completed
following the major incident.

Any corrective actions arising from the Major Incident Review will be added to the Major Incident Report
and also a Problem Record if appropriate, and tracked with POL through to completion. The updates will
be distributed to Atos as required, and in the case of a Security Major Incident associated with PCI
failures, the POL Security team will also receive a copy of the report.

As Fujitsu have interfaces with 3 parties such as American Express, then liaising with Post Office
representatives from Service and support teams such as the Payments team as well as 3% party
representatives will be required, in order to contain, remove data etc, so the potential PCI\GDPR data
breaches are resolved in a timely manner and with the required authorisations.
