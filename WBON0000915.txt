Hmmm...

Just a few thoughts...

A

JFSA knew at the outset that not all cases would go through to mediation — this could not have been made
clearer. We have obviously already covered this ground with the WG. My hope is that Tony will say that the
decision has been made and not re-open this point. If he does re-open the question, then my suggestion
would be that POL tacks hard in the opposite direction and seeks to persuade Tony that the current bar is too
lower (rather than just looking to maintain the current position).

During the initial discussions, it was made particularly clear to JFSA that old cases, where there was expected
to a lack of information, would likely not be mediated. Indeed POL's original proposal was a 6 year time bar on
applications but this was conceded in place of the language now in the Scheme documentation (“If there is
insufficient information for Second Sight to investigate a case, the case may not be investigated or may not
proceed to mediation.”)

Post Office never suggested that the Scheme was a search for the truth. To the contrary, it was the fact that

finding the truth was an almost impossible task (as following SS' first report they were worried that they could
never complete the "truth finding" exercise given to them by the MPs), that drove us to mediation — being, by
its very nature, a forum for resolving disputes without the need to ever find the truth.

Point 3 (about searching for and providing documents related to prosecutions in line with POL' statutory
duties) is outside the remit of the WG and I would strongly advise POL not to engage on this point with the
WG.
