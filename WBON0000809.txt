Dear Sir

Our Client - Post Office Limited

Post Office Limited -v- Mr Terence Walters
Claim No. 3YU26462

Consent Order

We write further to recent correspondence in respect of the above matter.

You should have now received our Client's claim in respect of recovery for account shortages and branch
discrepancies. Given that the limitation period was due to expire on 29 November 2013 (which would have
caused our client's legal rights to expire), our Client has issued a claim in order to protect its legal position.
In light of your application to the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme, we would look to stay
proceedings so to assure you that no further action will be taken at this time. As such, please find enclosed a
Consent Order. We would be grateful if you could please sign the Consent Order and return it using the pre-
paid envelope enclosed by Friday 20" December 2013.

Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours faithfully

Bond Dickinson LLP
