Dear All

You will have seen that we have fitted a Sparrow meeting into Tuesday evening agenda. This follows the
Sparrow Sub Committee which took place today.

The attached papers are circulated on behalf of Mark Davies and chris Aujard.

There are two annexes which were the papers taken at the sub committee and a summary paper which explains
the debate and sets out the recommendation to the Board.

We will add these papers to Boardpad on Monday.

Thanks
Alwen
