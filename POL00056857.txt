Hi Jon

OK. I've read the requirements and spoken to an expert. We do not understand the question and need
clarification on:-

The documents relating to the assessment of the pilot testing of Horizon Mark 2 and Horizon Mark 3,
the results of those assessments, the losses that were found within the system and details of
how those losses were reconciled or otherwise dealt with.

If you are talking about Horizon pilot we believe you will need to address your question to POL technical
experts. If it's something else, please qualify.

| will proceed with identifying which information we will be able to provide and the estimated costs for so
doing.

Speak soon.

Kind regards
Penny
