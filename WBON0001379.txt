David, Owain

Please find attached drafts of the flowcharts, the first of which deals with the TC process and the second with the
Branch Trading Statement process. We have sent these over to Post Office for fact checking and will let you know if

any amendments needs to be made.

We would welcome your thoughts and comments on these.

Kind regards
