Hi Andy
We have a mediation on Thursday for Mrs Katherine McAlerney (Leitrim 185713).
The lawyers have a asked a couple of questions that we need to respond to ASAP:
«There was a court order signed on 10 October 2011 and there was an agreement that there would be no

enforcement of the judgement/charges for 2 years from that date. Would you know why this delay was part of the
agreement?

e We never recovered the £5k / invoked the charges after Oct 2013? I'm assuming this was because Mediation was
kicking off & you were possibly instructed to put it on hold until after Mediation?

Thanks
Shirley
