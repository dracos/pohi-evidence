This statement is made in addition to my original statement made on 15*”
January 2013.

I have been asked to carry out an analysis of the Horizon Logs. I
present as exhibit GIJ/3 an extract from those logs showing all
Transactions carried out in Mode 15 - Housekeeping. These transactions
relate to the handling of Suspense account transactions and also the
settlement of any Discrepancies at the end of each Branch Trading
Period. The Branch Trading Statements for Periods 06 to 09 (ie on
13/10/10; 17/11/10; 15/12/10 and 12/01/11) have been exhibited as
Exhibits SB/7 to SB/10. Each shows at the bottom of the first page a
figure entitled “Total Branch Adjustments” where a negative figure

indicates a loss.

What exhibit GIJ/3 shows is how these Adjustments (ie losses) were
xesolved. At the end of Period 06 £1,065.56 was Settled Centrally. At
the end of Period 07 £4,211.21 was settled to Cash. At the end of
Period 08 £3,658.13 was settled to Cash. At the end of Period 09
£479.48 was Settled Centrally.

Settling Centrally means that the debt is removed from the local Branch
Accounts and is handled separately as a debt between the Branch Manager

and Post Office Ltd. However settling to cash means that the User has

indicated that they have added the required amount of cash into the till
and the system then increases the amount of cash expected for any future
balancing. However this doesn’t necessarily mean that any cash has
actually been put in the Till. It may merely be an account entry. If
that is what has happened then the discrepancy will reappear in the next
period and the money will still be owed to Post Office Ltd.

In relation to Exhibit GIJ/3 I use the term Made Good Cash, which really
means that the system has been told that the cash has been put in the
till. However the Tills on Horizon are not controlled by the system.
It therefore follows that entries showing that Cash has been Made Good

do not necessarily mean that Cash has actually been put in the till.
