years. I am employed as an Investigator by Post Office Ltd, at Liverpool Mail Centre and my duties
include making enquiries into crimes and suspected crimes at Post Offices. On 31" May 2006, I spoke
with Miss Skinner on the telephone. Miss Skinner agreed to attend a tape-recorded interview on 4%
June, The purpose of the interview and her legal rights were explained to Miss Skinner,she replied that
she wanted to get it sorted. A notebook entry of this conversation was made and I now produce this as
exhibit SB/1.

On 1 June, I was present with Diane Matthews while Janet Skinner, the sub postmaster from North
Bransholme Post Office Branch was interviewed. The interview commenced at 12.00, but the tape
machine became faulty. The interview then took place at Bransholme Police Station. The interview was
tape-recorded and commenced at 13.27 hours and ended at 15.32 hours. The Master tape seals

(043366, 043367 and 043368) were sealed in my presence.
