f sa2as The sample sizes and sampling methodology for measuring

(42)  €ompliance with approved scripts for cash account calls under
paragraphs 4.3.2.8 and 4.3.2.9 of this Schedule G10 will be
developed by POCL such that in the long term they would be
expected to result in a “false failure rate” of 5% or less, and a
“false success rate” of 10% or less.

These rates are defined in terms of the outcomes set out in the
I cues ne following table:

Sample estimate of Sample estimate of
compliance rate less compliance rate greater

than 95% than or equal to 95%
True compliance rate less I True failure False success

The “false failure rate” is the expected number of false failure
outcomes expressed as a proportion of the coral of true and false

failure ouccomes.

The “false success rate” is the expected number of false success
outcomes expressed as a proportion of the coral of true and false

success outcomes.
———

The method for selecting samples and determining sample sizes
to achieve the above characteristics will be decided by POCL and
recorded in a Contract Controlled Document. The Contractor
will be entitled to review this to gain assurance that the
methodology is in line with accepted practice in statistical
sampling, and to require POCL to make changes ifit is not. Any
disagreements about appropriate statistical methodology will be

resolved by reference to [suitable reference book) fenrkfatting.

POCL will carry out the initial analysis of the tapes (which will
be provided by#Zhe Contractor) and will document findings in LX :

relation to which calls are and are not compliant with the
Agsnon fe Se a ee ee eee
relevant scripts.

The Contractor will review and agree these findings, or provide a
factual statement of any cases where it takes a different view of

the compliance.

To the extent that the method involves more than one stage of
sampling, then POCL may decide to deem the service level to

have been achieved on the basis of the first stage sample,
notwithstanding that chac sample estimate may show a
compliance level below 95%.

Once sufficient samples have been analysed to comply with the
requirements for probabilities of errors as above, then either
party may request a full analysis of all calls in the relevant period
(rather than a sample). In that case, the results based on the full
analysis will be used in place of the sample estimates. The

reasonable additional costs of both parties will be borne by the
party requesting such a full analysis.

- CCD Title: “ICL Pathway/POCL Interface Agreement for
Operational Business Change — Product”?

- Pathway suggest an end date for joint process when CCD
signed off i.e. by 14/1/99

Amendments to SSA now not confined to part D of Schedule 4
—see Schedule 2

5.1

Reference to inducement to enter letter should be deleted as it is
linked to the reference to representations which has been
deleted.

3.1

- “other measures” replaced with arefberence to the defences
referred to in Schedule 4 and the additional reference data
controls in 5.2 (C)

- confirm that the defences referred to in Schedule 4 are
intended to be implemented by 24 January

- we suggest that “reasonable skill and care” is more appropriate
in context than “due diligence”

5.2

- item BS referred to in 5.2 (C) is not a Cash Account
Discrepancy — changed introductory sentence to refer to
“incident types”

- the AIC Release detects, rather than prevents errors (wording
changed accordingly)

5.2(A)

A process (rather than software) is being established for the
purpose of preventing récurrence of errors. It is not therefore
appropriate to say “develop, successfully test.” etc — wording
changed accordingly

5.2(B)

- new software is intended to prevent recurrence of CADs
associated with existing products. A process is to be put in
place to ensure this software is enhanced to cope with
products/methods of payment which may be introduced under
operational business change ‘in the future (wording changed
accordingly)

5.2(C)

- the prevention of incident types such as item BS is ultimately
within POCL’s control since POCL controls its business rules
and the provision of Reference Data to match those rules,
Pathway can assist POCL, and is doing so by the provision of
the attribute checker. Wording changed accordingly.

- Since not “Not Data Errors” are due to POCL, they should be
excluded from the definition of Cash Account Discrepancies in
Clause 7.1 of the SSA.

- Cash Account Discrepancies which would be caught ‘by
Reference data controls or which are “2 week errors” are not
the sort of errors which Pathway considers should be paid for in
accordance with Clause 7.2 of the SSA, as it was not the
purpose of the TIP Integrity Checking Process to detect such
errors. Such errors should also be disregarded i in the analysis of
parallel running - 2" week errors, in particular, will not be
caught by the Accounting Integrity Control Release.

Wording changed accordingly so as to provide wider
application in respect of those errors to be disregarded.

From the point of view of the validity of the proposed statistical
analysis, Pathway reserves its position — comments to follow.
General points include the following:

1.Consider effect of sampling- can this interfere with the
process or adversely affect success rates?

2. Factual statement to be provided by Pathway if it takes a
different view of compliance — how will disputes be resolved?

- There are some situations where migration may occur outside
of “Roll-out” e.g. re-automating an Outlet after reversion to
manual operation. Frthermore, some Outlets will be rolléd out
with CSR+. Reference to Roll out and CSR deleted
accordingly.

- Proposed exception is not acceptable — deleted accordingly.

3.6.1(b) and (c)

Wording change is not acceptable — too narrow. Revert to

accordingly

prior to transmission is new and is unacceptable — deleted

cash account
