Horizon
Compensation
Advisory Board

An independent advisory board of
parliamentarians and academics which
oversees compensation related to the
Post Office Horizon scandal.

This independent advisory board was established
to advise ministers about the Group Litigation Order
(GLO) Compensation Scheme
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensati
on-scheme-for-group-litigation-order-case-postmasters).
Its terms of reference were subsequently expanded
to include advice about the Department for
Business and Trade’s (DBT) oversight of the
delivery of other strands of Horizon-related
compensation by the Post Office.
