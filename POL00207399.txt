Ouch

Having now read this I think quite a lot of this is for next time after we get their next version if it is not improved. The
problem with some of this is that ultimately it makes some threats that we will struggle to deliver.

This would immediately find its way to JFSA and Tony and we would end upi where we don't want to be while Chris and
Tony are away.

Its helpful to know how we can strengthen it though!

Will definitvely remove the bit about the money.
Best wishes
Belinda

Jane,

Our collective thoughts attached. Might be a bit more than you were hoping for but we have tried to
- Polish the language a bit;
- Make it clear, the PO will not support the report as is;

- Give SS less 'wiggle room'.

Finally, as poor Mel will attest, the question of SS fees makes me start to foam at the mouth. Is there any way we can
hold back any/ all of the £700k while this matter is resolved?

Best

Craig

Dear Craig

I work with Nina, Mark, Belinda and Mel at the Post Office. We'd be very grateful your views on this latest version of
the letter to Second Sight, which has been amended further. Tonight if possible. I'm very sorry for the late notice.

Best wishes
