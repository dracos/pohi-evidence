POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT 1984 (PACE)

CODE C
REVISED
CODE OF PRACTICE FOR THE DETENTION,

TREATMENT AND QUESTIONING OF PERSONS BY

POLICE OFFICERS

The Codes of Practice apply to:-

a) Police Officers;

b) Persons “other than police officers who are charged with the duty
of investigating offences or charging offenders”

The duty on investigators other than police officers is “to have regard to any
relevant provision” of the codes. (s67(9) PACE 1984).

It is a question of fact whether or not a particular person is a person “charged
with the duty of investigating offences.”

Code C contains detailed provisions in relation to, amongst other things,

cautions (C:10), interviews (C:11 and Annexes C and E) and interviews at
police stations (C:12).

The Caution,

A person whom there are grounds to suspect of an offence must be cautioned
before any questions about it (or further questions if it is his answers to
previous questions that provide grounds for suspicion) are put to him for the

purpose of obtaining evidence which may be given to a court in a
prosecution.

He will not need to be cautioned if the

questions are put for other purposes
(Code C, para 10.1)

Where the interviewing officer already suspects the person to be questioned, a
caution should be given before any questions are asked.

What is an Interview?

Code C para 11.1A defines an “interview” as the “questioning of a person
regarding his involvement or suspected involvement in a criminal offence or
offences which, under paragraph 10.1, must be carried out under caution.”

Any questioning, whether formal or informal, of a person regarding his
involvement or suspected involvement in an offence should be under caution

if there are grounds for suspecting him of having committed the offence. (Rv
Sparks (1991) Crim LR 128 CA)

A conversation will constitute an interview if a suspect is being asked to
incriminate himself. (Batley -v- DPP, The Times, March 5th 199g Dc)

One question alone may be an interview.

A spontaneous statement made by the suspect cannot amount to an interview.

However any questions put as a result of the statement will clearly constitute
an interview.

Any spontaneous remarks should be put to the suspect at the commencement
of the formal interview: Code C para 11.4.

The Consequences of a Failure to Caution.

The absence of a caution in circumstances in which it should have been

administered will normally amount to a significant and substantial breach of
the code,

The suspect must be made aware of the true nature of the investigation. It is
only if this requirement is fulfilled that the suspect can make meaningful
decisions as to whether to seek legal advice or how to respond to questions.

A breach or breaches of a code of practice may lead to evidence obtained after
or in consequence of the breach being excluded by the trial judge.

Grug trafficking and suspected of having swallowed drugs. In the case bf the healthcare
needs of a person who has swallowed drugs, the custody officer subject to any clinical
directions, should consider the necessity for rousing every half hour. This does not negate
the need for regular visiting of the suspect in the cell

Whenever practicable, arrangements should be made for persons detained for assessment *

under the Mental Health Act 1983, section 136 to be taken to a hospital. Chapter 10 of the
Mental Health Act 1983 Code of Practice (as revised) provides more detailed guidance
about arranging assessments under section 136 and transferring detainees from police
stations to other places of safety.

tis important to respect a person's right to privacy and information about their health must
be kept confidential and only disclosed with their consent or in accordance with clinical
advice when it is necessary to protect the detainee’s health or that of others who come into
contact with them.

The custody officer should always seek to clarily directions that the detainee requires
constant observation or supervision and should ask the appropriate healthcare professional
‘0 explain precisely what action needs to be taken to implement such directions.
Paragraphs 9.15 and 9.16 do not require any information about the cause of any injury,
ailment or condition to be recorded on the custody record if it appears capable of providing
evidence of an offence.

The purpose of recording a person's responses when attempting to rouse them using the
procedure in Annex H is to enable any change in the individual's consciousness level to be
noted and clinical treatment arranged if appropriate.

Cautions

(a) When a caution must be given

A person whom there are grounds to suspect of an offence, see Note 10A, must be
cautioned before any questions about an offence, or further questions if the answers
Provide the grounds for suspicion, are pul to them if either the suspect's answers or silence,
(Le. feilure or refusal to answer or answer satisfactorily) may be given in evidence to a court
in a prosecution. A person need not be cautioned if questions are for other necessary
purposes, e.g.:

@

0

solely to establish their identity or ownership of any vehicle;

to obtain information in accordance with any relevant statutory requirement, see
paragraph 10.9;

(c)

in furtherance of the proper and effective conduct of a search, e.g. to determine the
Need to search in the exercise of powers of stop and search or to seek co-operation
while carrying out a search;

(d) to seek verification of a written record as in paragraph 11.13.

(e) Not used

Whenever a person not under arrest is initially cautioned, or reminded they are under
caution, that person must at the same time be told they are not under arrest and informed

of the provisions of paragraph 3.21 which explain how they may obtain legal advice
according to whether they are at a police station or elsewhere. See Note 10C.

A person who is arrested, or further arrested, must be informed at the time if practicable, or
if not, as soon as it becomes practicable thereafter, that they are under arrest and of the
grounds and reasons for their arrest, see paragraph 3.4, Note 108 and Code G, paragraphs
2.2 and 4.3,

As required by Code G, section 3, a person who is arrested, or further arrested, must also
be cautioned unless:

(2) itis impracticable to do so by reason of their condition or behaviour at the time;

(b) they have already been cautioned immediately prior to arrest as in paragraph 10.1.
(b) Terms of the cautions

The caution which must be given on:

(a) arrest;

(b) all other occasions before @ person is charged or informed they may be prosecuted:
see section 16,

should, unless the restriction on drawing adverse inferences from silence applies, see
Annex C, be in the following terms:

“You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention
when questioned something which you later rely on in Court. Anything you do say may be
given in evidence,”

Where the use of the Welsh Language is appropriate, a constable may provide the caution
directly in Welsh in the following terms:

‘Does dim rhaid i chi ddweud dim byd. Ond gall niweidio eich amddiffyniad os na fyddweh
chi sén, wrth gael eich hol, am rywbeth y byddwch chin dibynnu arno nes ymlaen yn y
Uys. Gall unrhyw beth yr ydych yn ei ddweud gael ei roi fel tystiolaeth."

See Note 106

Annex C, paragraph 2 sets out the alternative terms of the caution to be used when the
restriction on drawing adverse inferences from silence applies.

Minor deviations from the words of any caution given in accordance with this Code do not
constitute a breach of this Code, provided the sense of the relevant caution is preserved.
See Note 10D.

After any break in questioning under caution, the person being questioned must be made
aware they remain under caution. If there is any doubt the relevant caution should be given
again in full when the interview resumes. See Note 10E.

When, despite being cautioned, a person fails to co-operate or to answer particular
Questions which may affect their immediate treatment, the person should be informed of
any relevant consequences and that those consequences are not affected by the caution.
Examples are when a persons refusal to provide:

+ theirname and address when charged may make them liable to detention;

* Particulars and information in accordance with a statutory requirement, e.g. under the

Road Traffic Act 1988, may amount to an offence or may make the person liable to a
further arrest.

(c) Special warnings under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, sections
36 and 37

When a suspect interviewed at a police station or authorised place of detention after arrest
falls or refuses to answer certain questions, or to answer satisfactorily, after due warning,
see Note 10F, a court or jury may draw such inferences as appear proper under the

Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, sections 36 and 37, Such inferences may only
be drawn when:

(2) the restriction on drawing adverse inferences from silence, see Annex C, does not
apply; and

(0) the suspect is arrested by a constable and fits or refuses to account for any objects,
marks or substances, or marks on such objects found:

one of these matters or to answer it satisfactorily, the suspect must first be told in ordinary
language:

(d)_ a court may drawa proper inference if they fail or refuse to account for this fact;

(€) a record is being made of the interview and it may be given in evidence if they are
brought to trial.

(@) Juveniles and persons who are mentally disordered or otherwise mentally
vulnerable

10.14AThe information required in paragraph 10.11 must not be given to a suspect who is a
juvenile or who is mentally disordered or otherwise mentally vulnerable unless the
appropriate adult is present.

10.12 If a juvenile or a person who is mentally disordered or othenwise ‘mentally vulnerable is

cautioned in the absence of the appropriate adult, the caution must be repeated in the
adults presence.

(e) Documentation

10.13 A record shall be made when a caution is given under this section, either in the
interviewer's pocket book or in the interview record.

Notes for Guidance

10A There must be some reasonable, objective grounds for the suspicion, based on known facts
or information which are relevant to the likelihood the offence has been committed and the
person to be questioned committed it.

108 An arrested person must be given sufficient information to enable them to understand that
they have been deprived of their liberty and the reason they have been arrested, e.g. when
2 person is arrested on suspicion of committing an offence they must be informed of the
suspected offence's nature, when and where it was commited. The suspect must also be
informed of the reason or reasons why the arrest is considered necessary. Vague or
technical language should be avoided,

10C The restriction on drawing inferences from silence, see Annex C, paragraph 1, does not
apply to @ person who has not been detained and who therefore cannot be prevented from
seeking legal advice if they want, see paragraph 3.21.

10D _Itit appears a person does not understend the caution, the person giving it should explain it
in their own words.

10E It may be necessary to show to the court that nothing occurred during an interview break or

between interviews which influenced the suspect's recorded evidence. After break in an
interview or at the beginning of a subsequent interview, the interviewing officer should
summarise the reason for the break and confirm this with the suspect.

10F The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, sections 36 and 37 apply only to suspects
who have been arrested by a constable or an officer of Revenue and Customs sna are
given the relevant warning by the police or Revenue and Customs officer who made the
arrest or who is investigating the offence. They do not apply to any interviews with
suspects who have not been arrested,

106 Nothing in this Code requires a caution fo be given or repeated when informing a person
not under arrest they may be prosecuted for an offence. However, a court will not be able

to draw any inferences under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, section 34, if
the person was not cautioned.

11 Interviews - general
(2) Action

111A An interview is the questioning of a person regarding their involvement or suspected
involvement in a criminal offence or offences which, under paragraph 10.1, must be carried
Out under caution. Whenever a person is interviewed they must be informed of the nature
of the offence, or further offence. Procedures under the Road Traffic Act 1988, section 7 or

the Transport and Works Act 1992, section 31 do not constitute interviewing for the purpose
of this Code.

111 Following a decision to arrest a suspect, they must not be interviewed about the relevant

offence except at a police station or other authorised place of detention, unless the
consequent delay would be likely to:

(2) lead to:
* Interference with, or harm to, evidence connected with an offence;
* interference with, or physical harm to, other people; or
* serious loss of, or damage to, property;

(b) lead to alerting other people suspected of committing an offence but not yet arrested
for it; or

(6) hinder the recovery of property obtained in consequence of the commission of an
offence.

Interviewing in any of these circumstances shall cease once the relevant risk has been
averted or the necessary questions have been put in order to attempt to avert that risk.

11.48 A significant statement is one which appears capable of being used in evidence against the

Suspect, in particular a direct admission of guill. A significant silence is a failure or refusal
{0 answer a question or answer satisfactory when under caution, which might, allowing for
the restriction on drawing adverse inferences from silence, see Annex C, give rise to an
inference under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Par Ill

11.5 No interviewer may try to obtain answers or elicit a statement by the use of oppression.

Except as in paragraph 10.9, no interviewer shall indicate, except to answer 2 direct
question, what action will be taken by the police if the person being questioned answers
Questions, makes a statement or refuses to do either. If the person asks directly what
action will be taken if they answer questions, make a statement or refuse to do either, the

interviewer may inform them what action the police propose to take provided that action is
itself proper and warranted.

11.6 The interview or further interview of a person about an offence with which that person has

ot been charged or for which they have not been informed they may be prosecuted, must
cease when:

(2) the officer in charge of the investigation is satisfied all the questions they consider
relevant to obtaining accurate and reliable information about the offence have been
pul to the suspect, this includes aliowing the suspect an opportunity to give an
innocent explanation and asking questions to test if the explanation is accurate and
reliable, e.g. to clear up ambiguities or clarify what the suspect said;

(©) the officer in charge of the investigation has taken account of any other available
evidence; and

(c) the officer in charge of the investigation, or in the case of a detained suspect, the
custody officer, see paragraph 16. 1, reasonably believes there is sufficient evidence to
Provide a realistic prospect of conviction for thal offence. See Note 118.

This paragraph does not prevent officers in revenue cases or acting under the confiscation
Provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 or the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 from inviting
Suspects to complete a formal question and answer record after the interview is concluded.

Code must itself be recorded,

(c) Juveniles and mentally disordered or otherwise mentally vulnerable people

11.15 A juvenile or person who is mentally disordered or otherwise mentally vulnerable must not
be interviewed regarding their involvement or suspected involvement in a criminal offence
or offences, or asked to provide or sign a written statement under caution or record of

interview, in the absence of the appropriate adult unless paragraphs 11.1, 11.18 to 11.20
apply. See Note 11C,

11.16 Juveniles may only be interviewed at their place of education in exceptional circumstance:
and only when the principal or their nominee agrees. Every effort should be made to ni
the parent(s) or other person responsible for the juvenile’s welfare and the appropriate
adult, if this is a different person, that the police want to interview the juvenile and
reasonable time should be allowed to enable the appropriate adult to be present at the
interview. If awaiting the appropriate adult would cause unreasonable delay, and unless
the juvenile is suspected of an offence against the educational establishment, the principal
or their nominee can act as the appropriate adult for the purposes of the interview.

11.17 If an appropriate adult is present at an interview, they shall be informed:
+ they are not expected to act simply as an observer; and
* the purpose of their presence is to:

~ advise the person being interviewed;
~ observe whether the interview is being conducted properly and fairly:
~ facilitate communication with the person being interviewed.

(d) Vulnerable suspects - urgent interviews at police stations

14.18 The following persons may not be interviewed unless an officer of superintendent rank or
above considers delay will lead to the consequences in paragraph 11.1/a) to (c), and is

satisfied the interview would not significantly harm the person's physical or mental state
(see Annex G):

(a) a juvenile or person who is mentally disordered or otherwise mentally vulnerable if at
the time of the interview the appropriate adult is not present;

(b) anyone other than in (a) who af the time of the interview appears unable to:
* appreciate the significance of questions and their answers; or

‘* understand what is happening because of the effects of drink, drugs or any illness,
ailment or condition;

(©) @ person who has difficulty understanding English or has a hearing disability, if at the
time of the interview an interpreter is not present.

Codes of Practice - Code C Detention, treatment and questioning of persons by police officers

14.20 A record shall be made of the grounds for any decision to interview a person under
paragraph 11.18

Notes for Guidance

11 Paragraph 11.4 does not prevent the interviewer from putting significant statements and
silences to a suspect again at a later stage or a further interview.

11B The Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 Code of Practice, paragraph 3.5 states
‘In conducting an investigation, the investigator should pursue all reasonable lines of
enquiry, whether these point towards or away from the suspect. What is reasonable will
depend on the particular circumstances.’ Interviewers should keep this in mind when
deciding what questions to ask in an interview.

11C Although juveniles or people who are mentally disordered or otherwise mentally vulnerable
are often capable of providing reliable evidence, they may, without knowing or wishing to do
80, be particularly prone in certain circumstances to provide information that may be
unreliable, misleading or self-incriminating. Special care should always be taken when
questioning such @ person, and the appropriate adult should be involved if there is any
doubt about @ person's age, mental state or capacity, Because of the risk of unreliable
evidence it is also important to obtain corroboration of any facts admitted whenever
possible.

11D Juveniles should not be arrested at their place of education unless this is unavoidable.
When a juvenile is arrested at their place of education, the principal or their nominee must
be informed,

11E Significant statements described in paragraph 11.4 will always be relevant to the offence
and must be recorded. When a suspect agrees to read records of interviews and other
comments and sign them as correct, they should be asked fo endorse the record with, e.g.
‘Tagree that this is a correct record of what was said! and add their signature. if the suspect
does not agree with the record, the interviewer should record the details of any
disagreement and ask the suspect to read these details and sign them to the effect that
they accurately reflect their disagreement. Any refusal to sign should be recorded,

12 Interviews in police stations
(a) Action

12.4 Ifa police officer wants to interview or conduct enquiries which require the presence of a
detainee, the custody officer is responsible for deciding whether to deliver the detainee into
the officer's custody. An investigating officer who is given custody of a detainee takes over
responsibility for the detainee’s care and safe custody for the purposes of this Code until
they retum the detainee to the custody officer when they must report the manner in which
they complied with the Code whilst having custody of the detainee.

122 Except as below, in any period of 24 hours a detainee must be allowed a continuous period
of at least 8 hours for rest, free from questioning, travel or any interruption In connection
with the investigation concerned. This period ‘should normally be at night or other ‘
appropriate time which takes account of when the detainee last slept or rested. If a detainee
is arrested at a police station after going there voluntarily, the period of 24 hours runs from
the time of their arrest and not the time of arrival at the police station. The period may not
be interrupted or delayed, except:

(2) when there are reasonable grounds for believing not delaying or interrupting the period
would:

(i) involve a risk of harm to people or serious loss of, or damage to, property;
(fi) delay unnecessarily the person's release from custody;
(iif) otherwise prejudice the outcome of the investigation;

(b) at the request of the detainee, their appropriate adult or legal representative;

paragraphs 11.18 to 11.20.

12.4 As far as practicable interviews shall take place in interview rooms which are adequately
heated, lit and ventilated.

12.5 A suspect whose detention without charge has been authorised under PACE, because the
fetention is necessary for an interview to obtain evidence of the offence for which they
have been arrested, may choose not to answer questions but police do not require the
Suspec's consent or agreement to interview them for this purpose. Ifa suspect takes steps
‘o prevent themselves being questioned or further questioned, e.g, by refusing to leave their

15 Reviews and extensions of detention

(a) Persons detained under PACE

15.1. The review officer is responsible under PACE, section 40 for periodically determining if a
Person's detention, before or after charge, continues to be necessary. This requirement
continues throughout the detention period and except as in paragraph 15.10, the review
officer must be present at the police station holding the detainee. See Notes 154 and 15B.

15.2 Under PACE, section 42, an officer of superintendent rank or above who is responsible for
the station holding the detainee may give authority any time after the second review to
extend the maximum period the person may be detained without charge by up to 12 hours.
Further detention without charge may be authorised only by a magistrates’ court in
accordance with PACE, sections 43 and 44, See Noles 15C, 15D and 156,

18.2A An authorisation under section 42(1) of PACE extends the maximum petiod of detention
Permitted before charge for indictable offences from 24 hours to 36 hours. Detaining a
juvenile or mentally vulnerable person for longer than 24 hours will be dependent on the
Circumstances of the case and with regard to the person's:
(2) special vulnerability;

(b)

the legal obligation to provide an opportunity for representations to be made prior to a
decision about extending detention;

(C) the need to consult and consider the views of any appropriate adult; and
(d) any alternatives to police custody.

conferencing (see Note 15G) is a malter for the review officer. In determining the form the
review may take, the review officer must always take full account of the needs of the person
in custody. The benefits of carrying out a review in person should always be considered,

based on the individual circumstances of each case with specific additional consideration if
the person is:

(2) a juvenile (and the age of the juvenile); or

(b) suspected of being mentally vulnerable; or

(©) in need of medical attention for other than routine minor ailments; or
(¢) subject to presentational or community issues around their detention,

Before conducting a review or determining whether to extend the maximum period of
detention without charge, the officer responsible must make sure the detainee is reminded

of their entitlement to free legal advice, see paragraph 6.5, unless in the case of a review
the person is asleep.

If, after considering any representations, the review officer under paragraph 15.1 decides to
keep the detainee in detention or the superintendent under paragraph 15.2 extends the
maximum period for which they may be detained without charge, then any comment made
by the detainee shall be recorded. If applicable, the officer shall be informed of the
comment as soon as practicable See also paragraphs 11.4 and 11.13,

No officer shall put specific questions to the detainee:
* regarding their involvement in any offence; or
* in respect of any comments they may make:
~ when given the opportunity to make representations; or

~ in response to a decision to keep them in detention or extend the maximum period
of detention,

‘Such an exchange could constitute an interview as in paragraph 11.1 and would be
subject to the associated safeguards in section 11 and, in respect of a person who has
been charged, paragraph 16.5. See also paragraph 11.13.

A detainee who is asleep at a review, see paragraph 15.1, and whose continued detention
is authorised must be informed about the decision and reason as soon as practicable after

Notes for Guidance
154 — Review officer for the purposes of:

* PACE, sections 40, 40A and 45A means, in the case of a person arrested but not
charged, an officer of at least inspector rank not directly involved in the investigation
and, if a person has been arrested and charged, the custody officer,

158 The detention of persons in police custody not subject to the statutory review requirement in
paragraph 15.1 should still be reviewed periodically as a matter of good practice. Such
reviews can be carried out by an officer of the rank of sergeant or above. The purpose of
‘such reviews is to check the particular power under which a detainee is held continues to
apply, eny associated conditions are complied with and to make sure appropriate action is
taken to deal with any changes. This includes the detainee's prompt release when the
Power no longer applies, or their transfer if the power requires the detainee be taken
elsewhere as soon as the necessary arrangements are made. Examples include persons:
(2) arrested on warrant because they failed to answer bail to appear at court:

(0) arrested under the Bail Act 1976, section 7(3) for breaching a condition of bail granted
after charge;

(¢) in police custody for specific purposes and periods under the Crime (Sentences) Act
1997, Schedule 1;

(0) convicted, or remand prisoners, held in police stations on behalf of the Prison Service
under the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act 1980, section 6:

(e) being detained to prevent them causing a breach of the peace;

() detained at police stations on behalf of the Immigration Service;

(9) detained by order of 2 magistrates’ court under the Criminal Justice Act 1988, section
152 (as amended by the Drugs Act 2005, section 8) to faciliate the recovery of
evidence after being charged with drug possession or drug trafficking and suspected of
having swallowed drugs.

The detention of persons remanded into police detention by order of a court under the

Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, section 128 is subject to a statutory requirement to review

that detention. This is to make sure the detainee is taken back to court no later than the

end of the period authorised by the court or when the need for their detention by police
ceases, whichever is the sooner.

15C In the case of a review of detention, but not an extension, the detainee need not be woken

for the review. However, if the detainee is likely to be asleep, e.g. during a period of rest
allowed as in paragraph 12.2, at the latest time a review or authorisation to extend
detention may take place, the officer should, if the legal obligations and time constraints
permit, bring forward the procedure to allow the detainee to make representations. A
detainee not asleep during the review must be present when the grounds for their continued
detention are recorded and must at the same time be informed of those grounds unless the
review officer considers the person is incapable of understanding what is said, violent or
likely to become violent or in urgent need of medical attention.

15CA In paragraph 15.3(b) and (0), ‘available’ includes being contactable in time to enable them

{o make representations remotely by telephone or other electronic means or in person by
attending the station, Reasonable efforts should therefore be made to give the solicitor and
appropriate adult sufficient notice of the time the decision is expected to be made so that
they can make themselves available.

18D An application to a Magistrates’ Court under PACE, sections 43 or 44 for a warrant of

further detention or its extension should be made between 10am and Spm, and if possible
during normal court hours. It will not usually be practicable to arrange for a court to sit
specially outside the hours of 10am to 9pm. Ifit appears a special siting may be needed
outside normal court hours but between 10am and 9pm, the clerk to the justices should be
given notice and informed of this possibility, while the court is sitting if possible,

15E In paragraph 15.2, the officer responsible for the station holding the detainee includes a

Superintendent or above who, in accordance with their force operational policy or police

regulations, is given that responsibility on
holder is off duty or otherwise unavailable.

The provisions of PACE, section 40A allowing telephone reviews do not apply to reviews of

detention after charge by the custody officer. When video conferencing is not required,

they allow the use of a telephone to carry out a review of detention before charge. The

procedure under PACE, section 42 must be done in person.

Video conferencing facilites means any facilities (whether a live television link or other

facilities) by means of which the review can be carried out with the review officer, the
detainee concemed and the detainee’s solicitor all being able to both see and to hear each

other. The use of video conferencing facilities for decisions about detention under section

45A of PACE is subject to regulations made by the Secretary of State being in force.

Case Digest Subject: Criminal evidence

Keywords: Admissibility; Admissions; PACE codes of practice; Police
interviews

Summary: Admissibility; interview; Informal conversation with police

officer; no caution; whether an interview to which code of practice applied;
whether breach of code

Abstract: Following allegations by V, social workers interviewed S, who
admitted “interfering with" V (his step-daughter) since she was six and
having sexual intercourse with her since she was 11. Two police officers,
one of whom (X) was an acquaintance of S, then arrived, X was unsure
whether V wished to make a complaint, He said he was there to sit with $
and discover what was happening. During a friendly, informal conversation
S made further admissions. x was not the investigating officer and neither
cautioned S nor made notes of the conversation.

Held, dismissing S's appeal against conviction on the basis that the other
evidence against S was clear, that the conversation with X should have
been excluded as unfair under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
8.78 . The conversation was an "interview" to which the Code of Practice
applied. There were breaches of the Code's requirements for a caution and
the keeping of a proper record. The evidence was not, however, unreliable

Case Analysis

Case Digest Subject: Criminal evidence Other related subjects: Police

Keywords: Licensed premises; PACE codes of practice; Police interviews

Summary: police interviews; PACE codes of practice; questions put to
publican regarding after hours drinking constituted interview

Abstract: Having entered a public house, police officers, pursuant to their
suspicion that after hours drinking was taking place, asked the publican, B,
the nature of the arrangements relating to the premises. B was not
cautioned until after the conversation took place and a note was
subsequently taken of what was said, but the police officers failed to show
it to B so that he might verify its accuracy or endorse it as a true record of
events, as they did not consider it safe to go back into the public house. B
appealed by way of case stated against his conviction of supplying
intoxicating liquor contrary to the Licensing Act 1964 s.59, the magistrates
having found that the conversation did not constitute an interview under
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 Codes of Practice Code C, that it
would have been impracticable for B to check the note made by the police
officers and that therefore there had been no breach of the Codes.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the conversation between B and the police
officers was an interview within the meaning of Code C since, in answering
questions about the arrangements for the public house, B was being asked
to incriminate himself with regard to the offence under s.59 and those
questions should not have been put to B prior to a caution being
administered. The magistrates had erred In concluding that it was
impracticable for B to have been shown the note made of the conversation
as Code C did not require that the opportunity of verifying the accuracy of
the note must be offered immediately or not at all. The record could have
been shown to B at a later time and failure to do so caused prejudice to B
at his trial.

Judge: Kennedy, L.J.; Maurice Kay, J.
fi Counsel: For B: John Stobart. For the prosecution: Malcolm Gibney,

Solicitor: For B: Langleys (Lincoln). For the prosecution: CPS (Eastleigh).

PRINCIPLES OF DISCLOSURE

AN INTRODUCTION

Disclosure is one of the most important - as well as one of the most abused - of the
Procedures relating to criminal trials.

The overarching principle is that unused Prosecution materia! will fall to be disclosed

if, and only if, it satisfies the test for disclosure. Even then, it may not be disclosed
under certain circumstances.

Sources:

Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, ss.1—12.

Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996: Code of Practice under Part Il.
Attorney-General’s Guidelines on Disclosure.

Protocol: Control & Management of Unused Material in the Crown Court.

THE TEST FOR DISCLOSURE

LE PISCLOSURE

POL00094173
POL00094173

Material which might reasonably be considered capable of either

undermining the case for the prosecution against the accused, or
~ of assisting the case for the accused.

Criminal Procedure and investigations Act 1996, s

If the test is met, then disclosure unless the material is sensitive and Judge
tules we need not disclose (PII).

SL AE WE LOOKING FOR?

i. Any material which may cast doubt on the accuracy of any
prosecution evidence.

ii. Any material which may point to another person, whether
charged or not (including a co-accused) having
involvement in the commission of the offence.

iii. Any material which may cast doubt upon the reliability of a
confession.

iv. Any material that might go to the credibility of a prosecution
witness.

v. Any material that might support a defence that is either raised
by the defence or apparent from the Prosecution papers.

vi. Any material which may have a bearing on the admissibility of

any prosecution evidence, e.g. unlawfully obtained etc.

Disclosure Officers

believes will not form part of the prosecution case, must be listed on
‘one of the two schedules.

© The description of each item on the schedule should make clear the
nature of the item and should contain sufficient detail to enable the
Prosecutor to decide whether he needs to inspect the material before
deciding whether or not it should be disclosed.

1. Schedule of Non-sensitive Unused Material

2. Schedule of Sensitive Unused Material

Depending on the circumstances, examples of sensitive material may include the
following material:

¢ Communications between the investigators and solicitors,
other investigators, experts, other agencies (e.g. Police etc)

investigatory methods, or which might facilitate the
commission of other offences or hinder the Prevention and
detection of crime, e.g.

© Concealed CCTV systems used to detect crime;
o Covert tracking devices;

o Financial inquiry methods and organisations
(Experian etc);

Visions for the Future

Keir Starmer QC, Director of Public Prosecutions, addressed the London
Justices Clerk’s Society on 11! March 2011.

“The primary function of our criminal courts is, in reality, sentencing, not

trials, And that requires us to take a fresh look at how best to conduct
business there.”

“Whether and when a defendant enters a guilty plea makes a material
difference.”

“The first court appearance should be the end of the preparation process...not
the beginning, as is often the case at the moment.

The Changing Landscape

CJSSS - Criminal Justice: Simple Speedy Summary - Introduced in 2008.

EGPS - Early Guilty Plea Schemes - Designed to identify appropriate cases at

an early stage and expedite the plea and sentence, producing a just,
expeditious and cost effective outcome.

Section 41 & Schedule 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced
significant changes to the procedure for handling “either way” offences.
Those changes came into force on 5k November 2012 and include:

° Procedural changes to the plea before venue system in the magistrates’

court;

° The abolition of committal for trial proceedings and the introduction of
new allocation provisions;

The consideration of the defendant's previous convictions when.
deciding venue;

° The option for an adult defendant to seek a limited indication of

sentence from the magistrates’ court at the plea before venue stage.

The Combined Effect

In a number of recent cases which have been sent to the Crown Court,
standard directions have been issued which seek to identify those in which
early guilty pleas could be expected.

The Actions of the Defence Solicitor.

The Law Society issued

guidance to criminal defence solicitors on 6! October
2011:-

Criminal Plea in Absence of Full Disclosure.
4, Meeting your professional obligation

If your client is unsure about how to plead to the charge(s) but you require further
information in order to meet your professional obligations in providing adequate

advice, you should make both the court and your client aware of any problems this
may present,

Providing advice

You should advise your client about the sentencing discount they will be entitled to if
they plead guilty at the first opportunity.

If you advise the client to enter a not guilty plea, or to enter no plea, to protect his or
her position due to the lack of information, you should ask the court to make a note of
the circumstances and the rensons for pleading so.

To help your client retain the maximum credit for any subsequent guilty plea, you
should both:-

. advise your client about the situation;
inform the court of the predicament you face due to the lack of disclosure.

The Way Forward.

Establishing the points to prove and being clear in interview.
The use of template statements where possible.

Early case preparation to enable full disclosure to be made prior to the
first hearing.

1.1. Who should read this practice note?

Criminal defence solicitors.

Top of page
1.2 What is the issue?

Concerns have been raised by criminal defence practitioners following the publication of Effective Case
Management: Applying the Procedure Rules by the then Senior Presiding Judge for England and Wales.

The document states a requirement for, the defendant's plea to be taken at the first hearing in the Magistrates’
Courts, in all but exceptional cases. The court may therefore require your client to enter a plea where relevant and
important disclosure of the prosecution case has not yet been made available.

This practice note provides information on advising a client on plea in the absence of full disclosure,

Top of page
1.3 Professional conduct

The following sections of the SRA Code are relevant to this issue:

Principle 1 - You must uphold the rule of law and the proper administration of justice.
Principle 2 - You must act with integrity.

Principle 3 - You must not allow your independence to be compromised.

Principle 4 - You must act in the best interests of each client.

Principle 5 - You must provide a proper standard of service to your clients.

1.4 Status of this practice note

Practice notes are issued by the Law Society for the use and benefit of its members. They represent the Law
Society's view of good practice in a particular area. They are not intended to be the only standard of good practice
that solicitors can follow. You are not required to follow them, but doing so will make it easier to account to
oversight bodies for your actions.

Practice notes are not legal advice, nor do they necessarily provide a defence to complaints of misconduct or of
inadequate professional service. While care has been taken to ensure that they are accurate, up to date and
useful, the Law Society will not accept any legal liability in relation to them.

For queries or comments on this practice note contact the Law Society's Practice Advice Service.

41.5 Terminology in this practice note

Must - A specific requirement in legislation or of a principle, rule, outcome or other mandatory provision in the SR
Handbook. You must comply, unless there are specific exemptions or defences provided for in relevant legislation
or the SRA Handbook.

Should

+ Outside of a regulatory context, good practice for most situations in the Law Society's view.
+ Inthe case of the SRA Handbook, an indicative behaviour or other non-mandatory provision (such as may
be set out in notes or guidance).

These may not be the only means of complying with legislative or regulatory requirements and there may be
situations where the suggested route is not the best possible route to meet the needs of your client. However, if
you do not follow the suggested route, you should be able to justify to oversight bodies why the alternative
approach you have taken is appropriate, either for your practice, or in the particular retainer.

May - A non-exhaustive list of options for meeting your obligations or running your practice. Which option you
choose is determined by the profile of the individual practice, client or retainer. You may be required to justify why
this was an appropriate option to oversight bodies.

2. SRA principles

There are ten mandatory principles which apply to all those the SRA regulates and to all aspects of practice. The
principles can be found in the SRA Handbook.

Criminal plea in absence of full disclosure - The Law Society Page 3 of +

When thinking about how to meet the outcomes in principles 1 to 6 in the Code/Handbook, you must consider the
principles which apply across the Handbook including the Code. You should always bear in mind what the ten
principles are and use them as your starting point when implementing the outcomes.

3. The requirement

Paragraph (B) of Effective Case Management: Applying the Procedure Rules paraphrases Rule 3.8(2) (b) of the
Criminal Procedure Rules and states:

B) The first hearing: taking the plea
At every hearing (however early):

+ Unless it has been done already, the court must take the defendant's plea [Crim PR 3.8 (2)(b)]. This

obligation does not depend on the extent of advance information, service of evidence, disclosure of unused
material, or the grant of legal aid.

+ If the plea really cannot be taken (exceptions to the rule requiring plea to be taken are rare and must be
strictly justified), or if the alleged offence is indictable only, the court must find out what the plea is likely to
be [Crim PR 3.8(2) (b)].

Top of page

4 Meeting your professional obligation

If your client is unsure about how to plead to the charge/s but you require further information in order to meet your
professional obligations in providing adequate advice, you should make both the court and your client aware of an
problems this may present.

Top of page
4.1 Providing advice

You should advise your client about the sentencing discount they will be entitled to if they plead guilty at the first
opportunity.

If you advise the client to enter a not guilty plea, or to enter no plea, to protect his or her position due to the lack of
information, you should ask the court to make a note of the circumstances and the reasons for pleading so.

To help your client retain the maximum credit for any subsequent guilty plea, you should both:

* advise your client about the situation
+ inform the court of the predicament you face due to the lack of disclosure.

Top of page
4.2 Preserving credit on receipt of information

On receipt of the missing information you should aim to preserve your client's credit for a guilty plea by:

* taking urgent instruction from your client
* re-advising your client on the issue of their plea in the light of the new information.

If your client decides to plead guilty, you should notify the court as soon as possible, in order to fulfil your duty to
actively assist the court to manage the case under the Criminal Procedure Rules 2010. This will also help you to
protect your client's rights to the appropriate credit for an early guilty plea.
