Hello Andy,

Thanks for your email, which I have reviewed and discussed with Pete and Torstein. I have also just left you a VM on
your mobile.

l assume that you have received my email of and considered my response sent at 16:57 on Friday 30 June (copy
attached)?. This should answer most if not all your queries.

If it does not (or if you have received my email) this would imply that you require further clarification in order to answer
the pleadings.

We equally are not sure that the your questions are the right ones to be asking , in order for the pleadings to be
answered (for example pleading 21.1 which really relates to when the different types of line were available and from
whom) so we suggest a phone call would be a better way to handle these latest questions and requests for

clarifications.

Both Pete, and Torstein could make Friday 7 July at 12.00 pm. Unfortunately Pete has no other time slot available, so
hopefully this would suit you?.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards,

Chris

Christopher
It was good to meet you the other day at Counsel's chambers.

Please find attached an extract from our draft Defence that relates to Horizon. There are a few other odd paragraphs in
the Defence on which we may need your input but this extract is the main factual section on Horizon.

I should be grateful if your team could review this extract and provide any comments they may have. In particular, if they
could flag and explain any points that they believe not to be correct that would be much appreciated.

Would it be possible to complete this review by close of business on Thursday?

Kind regards
Andy
