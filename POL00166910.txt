Moderator 1: During this interview you can have a friend present if you wish, any friend who must
be over the age of eighteen and not involved in the inquiry, they shouldn't be a Post Office Limited
employee. I understand because of the nature of where we are on Hebridean island that might not

be easy to get our hands on and I'm quite happy to have your friend William McDonald happy to
be here as a friend, yes.

(TC: 00:01:42)

William Quarm: Right, okay.

Moderator 1: Okay. So, the next part is I've got a form here which needs to be completed with
regards to your friend being here and if you could just read that first part, you don't have to read it

Quarm has read and signed form CA003 and his friend William McDonald has completed the
lower half of that form. William I've got to advise you that I consider you to be a suspect ina
criminal offence, you're going to be asked questions about the account irregularities discovered
during the audit which was held here at Paible Post Office some three weeks ago. You're not bound
to answer any of these questions but if you do so your answers may be noted, will be tape recorded
and may be used in evidence. Do you understand that?

(TC: 00:05:09)

William Quarm: Yes, I do.

(TC: 00:05:14)

commenced your contract for services at Paible Post Office did you receive any training?

(TC: 00:05:38)

William Quarm: No.

(TC: 00:05:54)

that person has finished?

William Quarm: Yes.

(TC: 00:06:06)

Moderator 1: Yes. Did you learn from her then?

(TC: 00:06:08)

William Quarm: Yes. Well, I covered all her holidays and I covered every Saturday night and Thursday
morning.

(TC: 00:06:16)

Moderator 1: Okay. So, but she was the person who prepared balances and did the daily reports
and things like that, you'd be filling, Is that my understanding?

training take?

(TC: 00:06:40)

William Quarm: I was trained to be a trainer and I was taken down to the Dunfermline.

(TC: 00:06:45)

Moderator 1: Like, so you're taken down there, given some formal training of how the system
operated, how confident when you came away from that that you were able to perform that role
with training?

(TC: 00:07:09)

William Quarm: Not very because there was then a gap between the training and when-,

Moderator 1: The equipment being installed.

(TC: 00:07:16)

William Quarm: Yes.

(TC: 00:07:16)

Moderator 1: Right, okay. Did you receive any follow up training, you know, on your development
or was it something that you've just been able to pick up as you've gone along?

(TC: 00:07:25)

William Quarm: Only when there was training afterwards.

(TC: 00:07:28)

Moderator 1: Okay. Have you ever found the need to use a help desk at all, you know, if there's a
transaction with which you're not familiar?

(TC: 00:07:49)

William Quarm: Four I think.

(TC: 00:07:50)

Moderator 1: For four years. How would you rate your hands-on experience of Horizon now?

(TC: 00:07:57)

William Quarm: Well, it's changing all the time.

(TC: 00:07:58)
Moderator 1: Yes, it's evolving, absolutely. We're getting a new one, yes. So, there's new products,

new processes, new everything but do you feel confident about working with these processes, on a
scale of one to ten how would you rate your knowledge of the Horizon system?

(TC: 00:08:20)

William Quarm: Well, the whole Horizon system probably quite a low figure because we only have
certain products which sell here.

(TC: 00:08:29)

Moderator 1: Yes, okay. With those products that you sell then from this office how would you rate
that then?

Moderator 1: Right. How many hours did Sheila work?

(TC: 00:09:28)

William Quarm: Well, we changed it around from time to time but she was on afternoons.

(TC: 00:09:35)

Moderator 1: Right. So, it was, kind of, she would be flexy in the cover, if you didn't need her you
would say I'm not needing you today. Is that the way?

William Quarm: That door was sealed off, the one we' re using now. Okay, so I changed that over last
Saturday.

(TC: 00:12:00)

Moderator 1: Right, okay. Was that because of the fact that the Post Office is currently closed?

(TC: 00:12:05)

William Quarm: Well, it's to do a lot with training.

(TC: 00:12:06)

Moderator 1: Yes, I believe so, I think there's a trainer coming up next week to trawl around, I'm
to sure. I just know that the hotel we were staying in last night there was somebody booked in for
next week. So, we have nature and duties of yourself then, you had sole responsibility for doing the
daily reports, if you got a cheque in you would send the cheques away, if you got a giro bank
deposit you would send the deposit slips away, is that correct?

(TC: 00:12:39)

William Quarm: Yes.

(TC: 00:12:39)

Moderator 1: Yes. You're required by the Post Office to produce a four weekly or a five weekly
depending on which month branch training statement. In between times it's optional whether you
do a weekly balance, do you actually do a weekly balance?

Moderator 1: Right. Would she actually input the figures into Horizon or would she just count that
cash and leave it for you to do, what would be the process?

(TC: 00:14:06)

William Quarm: She would make others.

(TC: 00:14:09)

Moderator 1: She would make others but don't try to cover up for her and I'm aware that you're
being a bit hesitant with your answers which makes me think that you're hiding something. I'm just
thinking she's not going to be trouble if you have instructed her to do it, you know, to count the
cash and input the figures. She wouldn't end up in trouble if it's an instruction from yourself, do
you understand where I'm coming from?

(TC: 00:14:35)

William Quarm: I understand.

when you were doing a branch trading statement?

William Quarm: If she was serving somebody up in the shop and there's a customer waiting to be served
here.

(TC: 00:16:02)

Moderator 1: The important thing and I'm just going to bring this to your attention is that because
we know have online banking and finance products the Financial Services Authority require us to
have unique passwords and unique usernames so that we can provide a robust audit trail. What
you're demonstrating to me is that it wasn't as robust here, would that be a correct understanding?

(TC: 00:16:28)

findings, were you even there when it took place?

Moderator 1: So, the ATM then approximately what value, can you remember what the value was
that was the problem with the ATM?

(TC: 00:20:52)

William Quarm: It was around £600/£700.

(TC: 00:20:56)
Moderator 1: Right, because I noticed just from looking at your branch trading statements you
keep about £2,000 in the ATM, right, up or down, yes. So, it wasn't the whole amount of money

from the ATM, the problem was it was a certain amount of money. So, you reckon that figure of
£40,277 should be slightly lower because of this problem?

(TC: 00:21:23)

William Quarm: Yes.

correct?

William Quarm: Yes.

which the bank already approved. I was moving money about.

(TC: 00:23:16)

Moderator 1: Okay, right.

(TC: 00:23:17)

Moderator 2: Sorry Raymond for the benefit of the tape could you just confirm what statement
you're reading.

(TC: 00:23:20)

Moderator 1: Yes, sure. Well, basically it's a letter from Mr WD Quarm Bayhead Shop, Paible Post
Office, stated the 28th July 2008, it's addressed to Brian Trotter a contracts manager and it's a
reference how the shortage at Paible Post Office came about. It's a fairly lengthy letter, I won't
read it all out but it shows that Mr Quarm has used Post Office money to supplement his regular

business. On the premise that he had an agreed loan with the bank and the agreed loan with the
bank was also in conjunction with the sale of some property is that correct?

(TC: 00:24:05)

William Quarm: Yes.

(TC: 00:24:06)

year?

(TC: 00:24:39)

William Quarm: Autumn but I recognised that of course we'd have a problem but it was after I
approached the bank.

(TC: 00:24:50)

(TC: 00:24:58)

(TC: 00:25:05)

Moderator 1: Okay. That was to tide you over?

(TC: 00:25:08)

William Quarm: Well, yes. Well, it was for February onwards.

(TC: 00:25:13)

that money or was it for the pretext of the sale of some property that you had?

Moderator 1: What was the value of that property?

(TC: 00:25:26)

William Quarm: £50,000.

(TC: 00:25:27)

Moderator 1: £50,000. So, you were selling a property at £50,000 and the bank was lending you
£20,000 on the pretext that they would get their money back once your property was sold, is that
the way it works, yes, okay. So, the loan never come through, you never came through and it never
came through. So, what was it you actually did to use Post Office money, I mean, did you physically
take it from the Post Office or did you start paying bills with the Post Office or just generally how
did you go about using the Post Office money? I mean, we're now at a stage with the audit teams
result we're £40,000 short, was that a case that you needed to take £10,000 or was that on a weekly
basis where you've used Post Office money to pay back to pay bills?

(TC: 00:26:37)

William Quarm: It's part of the statement. I was transferring money on a weekly basis to the Alliance &
Leicester account.

Moderator 1: Tickets, yes, well yes, sorry, absolutely, right. So, have you ever physically taken
money out of the post office till or taken to the Royal Bank of Scotland?

(TC: 00:41:05)

William Quarm: Well, we don't have such a thing as a till, you know.

(TC: 00:41:07)

Moderator 1: Well, okay, Post Office money, I mean, if it's in a box.

(TC: 00:41:13)

William Quarm: (inaudible 41.13), at the end of the day, Post Office money was checked here and then
my tills come up here and were checked here, my till drawers were brought.

Moderator 1: Okay, so do you know how much it actually took, on a weekly basis, to run your shop
or your business, how much money you should be taking in to keep it solvent?

(TC: 00:41:44)

William Quarm: Roughly, yes

(TC: 00:41:45)

Moderator 1: How much was that, about?

(TC: 00:41:47)

William Quarm: I could give you a figure (inaudible 41.48).

(TC: 00:41:49)

Moderator 1: Just approximate figure. (Silence 41.50-42.04).

(TC: 00:42:05)

William Quarm: No, couldn't give you an exact-,

(TC: 00:42:08)

Moderator 1: We're not looking for exact figures, just an approximate figure, in the region of

what?

(TC: 00:42:14)

William Quarm: Well, £10,000.

(TC: 00:42:17)

William Quarm: Yes.

(TC: 00:42:19)

Moderator 1: Right, and at the end of the week, if the takings were short, were you using Post
Office money to top that up?

(TC: 00:42:29)

William Quarm: Well, no, it wasn't done like that, no.

(TC: 00:42:31)

Moderator 1: It wasn't done like that?

(TC: 00:42:32)

William Quarm: No.

(TC: 00:42:34)

Moderator 1: See, what we're just trying to figure out or get to the bottom of, what actually was the
Post Office money used for? We know it's to keep the business afloat but we're trying to find out
how you did that. We're not trying to trip you up. We're just trying to find out the facts of how you

physically used the Post Office money. Did you put it into your bank account or did you actually
physically use that money to pay suppliers in cash?

(TC: 00:43:03)

William Quarm: No, there was never any paying in cash.

(TC: 00:43:07)

Moderator 1: What about your cash and carry? Is it Roberts Ltd?

(TC: 00:43:10)

William Quarm: Lovett' s.

Moderator 1: Lovett's Ltd, how did you pay them?

(TC: 00:43:16)

William Quarm: By cheque.

(TC: 00:43:17)

Moderator 1: By cheque, right, so you had to make sure there was enough in the account to pay
them by cheque. Did you put Post Office money into the account to ensure that cheque wouldn't
bounce, to cover the value of the cheque?

(TC: 00:43:35)

William Quarm: No, what I tried to do is put £700 of cash per day into the Alliance & Leicester account.

(TC: 00:43:44)

Moderator 1: Right, and were your shop takings falling below that level for you?

(TC: 00:43:51)

William Quarm: Not normally, no.

(TC: 00:43:52)

Moderator 1: Not normally, so if you were getting £700 per day takings to pay Lovett's, how have
come in to get into this situation?

(TC: 00:44:07)
Moderator 1: Did you move the money from-, once your money was in the Alliance & Leicester

account, did you then move it into the Royal Bank account from there?

Moderator 1: Yes, because we've only got a minute left. The tapes are about to finish. I need to
continue the interview but prior to doing that, could I ask you to read out the master tapes here for
me, the number at the top?

(TC: 00:44:38)

(TC: 00:44:41)
