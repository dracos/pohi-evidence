Signature
I have been employed by Royal Mail Group (formally known as the Post Office and Consignia) for 20

Years. I have been a Post Office Branch Manager for 15 years and I have been the Branch Manager at

Huyton Post Office for 2 years. The person I know to be Lisa Brennan was already a member of staff

When I took up the position of Branch Manager at Huyton Post Office. She would perform the normal

Range of counter duties expected of a clerk. She would as with other clerks perform any extra work

Asked of her by myself the Branch Manager or the Assistant Branch Manager, for example helping with

The office cash account balance by checking work. At this office the clerk is issued with a date stamp

The date stamp is kept in a box which is locked with a key. The clerk has sole responsibility for this key.

All the date stamps bear a unique indicator of either a letter or a character. At the end of their duty, the

date stamp box is put in a filing cabinet, which is locked at the end of the day. During my time as the

Branch Manager, I have not issued any date stamps, nor have I changed the date stamp issued to any

clerks. The Post Office uses an accounting system known as horizon. The horizon system consists of a

keyboard, printer, processor and screen. In addition to the individual terminals there is a centrally located

system in the office which is used to collate the information from individual terminals in order to produce

a full office balance. A pension and allowance payment is made as follows. The customer will present

themselves at the counter and hand over their book. On the front of the book is a bar code. The bar code

is then scanned, which allows the clerk into the horizon system. The clerk will then enter how many

Vouchers are to be paid and the amount of the voucher. This will then be totalled and the correct amount
