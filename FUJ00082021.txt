IF} Response :

Cash statement shows double on Weds because ONCH is declared with Id 01
then

Declare Cash uses Id 03.

Spoke to PM, he says clerk declares ONCH for her drawer then he transfers
it

to his drawer for balancing. I explained it should be declared
consistently

(e.g. by using drawer 1), currently appears to the system as if the same
amount of cash is held in two drawers and therefore they have twice as
Inuch.

IHave talked to Deirdre Conniss about this as this is affecting a number of
sites and SAPADS are concerned. May require changes to PO documentation. I
ill check LFS (exp. S11 changes) to see if it is behaving according to
spec.
