ISSUES ARISING FROM SERVICE REVIEW BOOK -
PERFORMANCE STATISTICS

Horizon System Helpdesk

Deirdre Murrow reported that whilst the call volume remained
steady the HSH experienced a significant decrease of Advice and
Guidance calls from December in relation to faulty bar-codes on
some OBCS books.

During January there were 57 calls to Horizon System Helpdesk to
record the planned counter refurbishment.

David McLaughlin to liaise with the Horizon Implementation Team
to ensure that they are aware of the calls made to the Horizon
System Helpdesk on refurbishment.

David McLaughlin asked for clarification on whether there was a
contingency for power failures after Live Trial for the HSH.

Martin Riddell in response confirmed that there would be two sites
for Release 2.

Call Resolution - Printer (Hardware) Calls monitoring

Peter Robinson handed out supporting notes report on:

1) Horizon Printer Calls monitoring

2) Keypoints Analysis

3) Detailed Monitored Analysis

The analysis highlighted that a single outlet (277511) generated the
22% (4 out of 18) of the printer related calls in January. The route
cause analysis did not identify any trends. Two of the calls have
been resolved without visits and the other two calls were resolved
after visits.

Andy Radka asked ICL Pathway to notify Business Service
Management immediately once a particular outlet has been
identified as a problem office i.e. the outlet accounts unusually high
proportion of the calls.

Call Resolution - Software Calls

David McLaughlin asked whether ICL Pathway identified why the
software calls were increasing in the last four months (Oct 98’- Jan
99")

Deirdre Murrow responded that login problems i.e. users forgetting
their login password can account for the increased number of calls.

Andy Radka asked David McLaughlin to model the current trends
for Live Trial.

5. REVIEW OF THE EXISTING LIVE SERVICE

5.1 Incomplete Transactions
David McLaughlin expressed concern that a fix introduced to the
system did not work e.g. Time-out fix.

AP990205 David McLaughlin to liaise with Horizon Testing team to arrange =D. McLaughlin
verification that Release 2 fixes were effective through testing.

5.2 Incomplete Transaction meeting
David McLaughlin asked for clarification regarding continuation
of the Incomplete transactions meetings between Post Office
Counters Ltd. and ICL Pathway.
In response Martin Riddell confirmed that the group ceased the
meetings with the caveat of arranging workshop when the need
rises and the parties agree through the HSRF that it was
appropriate to do so.

5.3 Faulty Bar codes on OBCS books.
Dawn Mitchell updated the forum regarding the situation
surrounding this problem. At the present Authorised Temporary
Procedures are in place and the outlets are aware what to do when
to book does not scan i.e. the clerk will stamp across the barcode
and revert to manual procedures to pay the benefit. The ATP will
expire on 27 March. By that time it is hoped that the Benefits
Agency has solved underlying cause of the problem.

AP990206 Faulty bar-codes on OBCS books. D.McLaughlin
The Authorised Temporary Procedures expires on 27 March.
Decision needs to be taken whether the underlying problem has
been removed or there is a need to extend the ATP.

54 Data Migration weekend - foreign encashment availability
Dawn Mitchell raised concern that foreign encashments would
available during Data Centre migration in May ona Saturday
afternoon. Dawn pointed out that security risk associated with the
potential encashments was smaller than the potential business
risks, especially in the present politically sensitive situation and
asked ICL Pathway to consider the other to options available.

Martin Riddell in response said that the principles of such a
migration were previously accepted by all domains i.e. the service
not being available at post offices.

Dawn Mitchell restated that there is a significant business from
CAPS point of you if the customer is not able to withdraw benefits
during the migration period.

David McLaughlin added to the discussion that all the three

options have been discussed at the Migration meeting and no
decision has been made to date.

7.2 Scalability
Andy Radka asked all parties to consider that is vital for the
successful running of the service that all the parties work together.
In particularly to ascertain that the system is scalable for National
Rollout and have end to end visibility.

Information channels between Post Office Counters Ltd. and
Benefits Agency allow undertaking the work to provide assurance
that the system is scalable.

Andy Radka said that he was aware of the commercial and
contractual situation surrounding this issue but asked ICL.
Pathway - based on the discussion late last year with Stephen
Muchow and Paul Hanson - to participate.

AP990211 Paul Westfield agreed to progress this within ICL Pathway.
Contingency Testing

AP990212 David McLaughlin to circulate Phil Turnock’s note on contingency D.McLaughlin
testing.

7.3 Stephen Chandler highlighted that sections 2.2 of the main report
and 1 of the highlight report did reflect correctly the Benefits
Agency’s position.

AP990213 Kit Cox will contact Stephen Chandler to discuss the wording of Kit Cox
the sections in question.

Contractual status of the Framework Documents

The contractual status of the framework documents is not agreed.
Stephen Chandler said that the joint BA/ POCL Contract team
strongly advocates making the documentation contract controlled.
BA similarly supports this view.

The forum agreed that the contractual status of these documents
would not prevent Live Trial & that ownership rested with the
HSRF.

Dawn Mitchell added to the discussion that having the Framework
Documentation contract controlled is a good opportunity to clarify

ownership issues.

AP990214 Andy Radka to discuss the status of the Framework documentation Andy Radka
with the joint BA/POCL contract team.

David McLaughlin to present at the next meeting how this

9. SERVICE IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES

91 Andy Radka had agreed with Benefits Agency at the CAPS

parties would consider swapping someone into each others SM
work area on secondment.

Other initiatives under consideration between BA & POCL were:

locations & meet teams.

2) A seminar to be held with POCL/BA business management
function to generate better understanding of the respective
business and build better working relationships

three initiatives.

10. ANY OTHER BUSINESS,

10.1 Paul Westfield asked Andy Radka to share POCL position on the
planned POCL Business Support Centre and how it would
impact on the Horizon System Helpdesk.

In response Andy Radka said that he fully appreciated the need
for starting discussion on the subject with all involved parties
when appropriate. At the present the POCL vision was to
achieve a support structure which provided a ‘one stop shop’
with one call number for all outlets. This vision had to be finally
agreed & authorised and current call handling arrangements
would continue until then. In particular the HSHD would
operate as contractually agreed for live trial and the start of
National Roll Out. The current planning assumption in POCL is
that the primary Business Support Centre would be operational
by December 1999. It would only be for after then when
consideration of routing all calls to the POCL centre would be
evaluated. In the meantime appropriate & scalable support for
live trial & for NRO were being planned for one centre in Leeds.
Pathway & BA would be involved in planning the interface
procedures and links.

10.2 Martin Riddell suggested that at the next meeting the group
should discuss readiness for Live Trial.

AP990218 Eszter Meszaros to add Live Trial to the agenda for the future Eszter Meszaros
meetings.
