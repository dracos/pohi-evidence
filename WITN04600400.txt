POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FOURTH WITNESS STATEMENT OF JAN ROBERT HOLMES

I, JAN ROBERT HOLMES, will say as follows:

1. I have reviewed two of my earlier Witness Statements presented to the
Inquiry and realise that I have made a mistake that affects two separate
situations described therein. The problem is that I confused a single
appearance at a Court with two different POL investigations, Cleveleys and
Camberwell Green.

2. At paragraph 19 of my first Witness Statement [WITN04600100] I stated, in
the context of prosecuting SPMs, that :

“Because of my role as Audit Manager I was involved in a number of them
and this involvement ranged from undertaking simple data extractions to

producing Witness Statements and, on one occasion, being invited/required

to attend Court to give testimony in support of a Witness Statement. In the
end this case was, I believe, settled out-of-court and I was not needed. This
happened in 2004 although the allegations against the Post Master dated
back to 2000 and was documented in the Audit Report on Cleveleys Post
Office [WITN04600106].”

. At paragraph 9 of my second Witness Statement [WITN04600200] I

repeated this assertion :

“I attended court but was not required as POL had made an increased offer to

the PM and she had dropped her case.”

. These were both incorrect statements insofar that I did not attend Court for

the Cleveleys case and evidence this through the absence of any travel or
subsistence expenses (to and from Blackpool) for the period in question.

. However, I do recall attending Court on another case but this was in
Kingston-on-Thames. My travel and subsistence expenses show three
separate visits to Kingston on 21% February 2002, 16" April 2002 and week
ending 26" April 2002 which I now realise were to do with the Camberwell
Green case.

. Consequently the statement made at paragraph 11 of my second Witness

Statement [WITN04600200] that :

“The resultant Witness Statement (Witness Statement of Jan Holmes re:
Camberwell Green, WITN04600217) was produced but I do not know what

happened to it post-production or if it ever found its way into Court.”

was an incorrect statement, since it did find its way into Court and I attended,
potentially to speak to it as a Witness of Fact. As with Cleveleys this matter

was settled out of Court and I was not required to appear in Court.

7. I would like to sincerely apologise to the Inquiry for the confusion caused and

hope that this Witness Statement clarifies the situation.

Statement of Truth

I believe I G RO iment to be true.
