Dear Peter
RE: NOTIFICATION OF A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO A CLAIM

The national press have recently published articles relating to potential financial discrepancies that have
occurred across the network arising from Post Office Ltd.'s Horizon IT system.

In accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy, I am formally advising this as a potential
circumstance that may give rise to a claim under our Directors and Officers Liability placed via yourselves.

Please note that no claim has been intimated, we are advising this to insurers purely as a precautionary
measure at this time.

Please contact me should you require any additional information.

Yours sincerely

Charles Colquhoun
Head of Corporate Finance
