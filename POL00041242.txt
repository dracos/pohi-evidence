RE: first para, could we do this ~ “Mr Jonathan Swift QC was engaged by Past Office to advise the Chairman on this
review”?
Re: the sixth para, does this work?:

Mr Robinson's “very strong advice" was that Mr Parker's review should cease immediately. This would help preserve the
privilege in Mr Parker's review, and particularly the implementation of Mr Swift's recommendations by Mr Parker, and

protect against the risk that material related to these actions could be disclosed to the Claimants in the Group Action,
undermining Post Office's prospects of success and / or negotiating position.

Hi Rod
I have made the changes we discussed save the first one in the second para as I believe the original wording is correct.
Let me have your proposed amends to the sixth para and once agreed I can slot them in.

Kind regards
