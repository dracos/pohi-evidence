Mediation Scheme Narrative (key messages to be agreed)

Post Office is committed to addressing concerns raised by subpostmasters

- Post Office is determined to ensure that Horizon and any associated processes are fair, effective
and reliable, and the subpostmasters can have confidence in the system.

-  Areport into the Horizon system produced in July 2013 found there were no systemic issues with
the Horizon system. However, it found that improvements could be made in the training and
support processes provided to subpostmasters.

- The Mediation Scheme was established to help resolve the concerns raised by some
subpostmasters regarding the Post Office’s Horizon computer system and other associated
issues

- The Scheme is being overseen by a Working Group, chaired by Sir Anthony Hooper, comprising
representatives from Post Office, Second Sight and JFSA.

- The application process for the Initial Mediation Scheme opened on the 27th August and closed
on the 18th November 2013

- All matters discussed in mediation will be strictly confidential and subject to ‘without prejudice’
privilege which means that matters discussed in mediation cannot be disclosed to any third party
or any Civil Court.

- Where common ground cannot be reached, the mediator will help the parties identify their
differences and then try to find a resolution to those differences.

- The mediation itself will be administered by an independent mediation body and the mediator
will be selected by parties from a panel of mediators.

- The Post Office will produce a statement at the end of the mediation scheme.
