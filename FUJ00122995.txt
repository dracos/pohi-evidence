Further to our discussion regarding this matter.

We will need to provide a statement in due course to deal with the duplication of data. I mentioned that
jit would be helpful if Gareth's statement could be revisited in part. I am attaching your draft with a
few comments which should be amended in conjunction with Gareth's statement.

The statement will have to be made by Gareth or someone who understands the technicalities.

After tomorrow I will be next in the office on the 4th October. Rob Wilson is aware of this matter
should you need to discuss this before then

Juliet, do you think this draft would be okay. I'11 run it past Penny at Fujitsu and ask them to ‘top
and tail’ it into a witness statement if you're happy with it (ignore the attachment, this is the
original).

On audits of transactions, there occurs a duplication of records when records were in the process of
being recorded purely for audit purposes from the correspondence servers to the audit servers. This has
always been the case; however the mechanism used on Horizon to retrieve audit data took this into account
and only presented one instance of such duplicate data. As offices have migrated to the new HNGx
application, any requests made for audit data during this period, the mechanism used to filter out
duplicates did not remove them from the audit data.

The duplicates only occur in the audit data, and does not effect the actual physical transactions
recorded on any counter at any outlet.

This problem has now been resolved, however a small number of audit requests made during the period from
HNGx migration until the resolve will show the duplicate transactions.

Regards

Mark
