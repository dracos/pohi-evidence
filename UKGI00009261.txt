Hi Will

Have discussed with POL, they are nervous about prejudging the outcome of future trials
which will look at individual claims but have suggested the addition in bold below to the
third paragraph, which hopefully addresses your point below?

I believe the courts are the right place to hear the issues being raised and hope that the
legal case will assist in the resolution of what are long-standing issues between some
postmasters and the Post Office so that postmasters with claims can obtain a remedy if
the court finds there is validity to those claims.

Regards
Craig

Dear Colleague,

Postmasters are the backbone of the Post Office, and their branches are the backbone of
UKG100009261
UKGI00009261

communities across the country. That’s why we committed to safeguarding the post office
network and protecting existing rural services. The overall number of post offices across
the UK remains at its most stable in decades with over 11,500 branches thanks to
significant Government investment of over £2 billion.

The judge has, however, been highly critical of the Post Office’s handling of the case and
finds that over the long period of time addressed by the judgment, there have been times
when Post Office’s conduct in its dealings with the lead claimant postmasters have been
heavy-handed, some of its operations insufficiently transparent, and its procedures and
processes lacking in consistency and professionalism.

The judgement is complex and lengthy and the Post Office will need time to consider in
detail, including whether it has a case for appeal. However, having spoken over the
weekend with the Chairman of POL, I am assured they have acknowledged the criticism,
are taking it very seriously, and will be taking appropriate action where necessary.

Legal proceedings in this case are currently scheduled to continue until at least March
2020. While this dispute remains a matter for the courts, it is clearly not appropriate for
Government to comment further. However, I will be remaining in close contact with the
Post Office over the coming weeks and months as they deliver on their commitments to
improve.

I understand that this issue will be of interest and concern to Members of the House and,

as this process progresses, I will update Members further.

Post Office have now seen the draft and have emailed Gavin and me to say they have
significant concerns - not with the spirit but with the way it is worded.

As mentioned in my earlier email I think the current draft will cause the lawyers problems
in relation to handling the case.

I suggest there needs to be a discussion with POL to agree with POL a form of words that
conveys what is wanted but that doesn’t damage the case.

Hi All,

Please see readout below of the call between Kelly and POL this afternoon

Actions:
* KT Private Office to set-up a call with Al Cameron on Tuesday
morning before Orals, so that Kelly gets an update on the boards
discussions the previous day.

* Gavin/Tom to ensure our office is kept well informed of progress and
to provide a weekly update.

Discussion Points:
* TP was surprised by the outcome of the judgment, however POL’s
intention is to be fair and not defensive and aim to bring a good case to
reach a fair settlement. He confirmed that they would look at their
procedures and the opportunities to improve. He acknowledged where
they can do things better, and if it costs them money (could be as much
as £100m) they will look to manage the costs. He mentioned there was
a few legal points that were of concern and they will be receiving
subsequent advice to review this in more detail, and looking at whether
they should do an appeal. KT stated the importance that BEIS are
consulted before they make any intention to appeal.
© They are currently assembling as much information they can, so at
their board meeting on Monday, they know what needs to be done.
They will discuss ways to improve the manner they run their branches,
so when disputes arise they are dealt with fairly. They will also look to
review the question on where the judge has been biased on and
whether they will ask him to recuse himself from the horizon trial.
Unlikely that we will do this, but they will consider whether it is an
action, they should take forward. It is a legal pressing matter that
would need to be addressed sooner rather than later.(Line was fuzzy/
interruption at this point - so I may have not captured this correctly)

« Al Cameron made clear that they would not go down this route until
there was final agreement with everyone and will of course keep us
updated. They will also discuss their views of the rationale of doing an
appeal and where the focus is. They have started doing work streams
since the judgement, such as the process of managing differences
correctly. He mentioned that some of the cases are 20 years old and
how it will be hard for them to be exactly sure of the circumstances.
However, they will not be avoiding their liability, they are going to
listen but will also highlight where they have improved in cases over
time. They are also looking at mediation schemes, to compensate
people that were treated badly.

© KT outlined that it was a disappointing judgement, she understood
the complexities that they face and appreciated that they are taking
this seriously. In regards to the liabilities, she said £100m was a
significant amount, and that Government may be involved in the sign
off or funding of this amount. They discussed the operational issues and
the criticism faced on the culture and practices. She highlighted the
point that as the responsible Minister she will be held to account and
rightly so in the House and how this should be bared in mind. On that
basis, she stressed the importance of Post Office sharing information
with BEIS and that she is kept updated throughout the whole process.

© KT made the point that this judgement could justify the criticisms the
Post Office are receiving on postmasters pay. She addressed that the
issues on the franchising plans and postmasters pay and this judgement
will be perceived as the same argument, with the ongoing concerns on
Post Office. TP outlined that it was important to keep the issues
separate if possible, but understands the difficulties within this. KT
highlighted her concerns on the impression she was given at her last
meeting with Post Office on the case, and the expectation that there
would be a better outcome then what was handed. Therefore was
concerned about the legal advice and independence of this and how
important it was to understand the issues.

* She informed them that she would be meeting with 10 labour MPs
on franchising on Monday, and that they will mention this judgement.
She raised the point that where there has been unjust actions against
employees, individuals should receive settlements where postmasters
have been affected.

UKG100009261
UKGI00009261
* KT asked who will be leading on this, as Paula had step down and
emphasised the need for her to have an understanding of the actions
that Post Office will be taking forward. She expressed her appreciation
of the work of the Post Office and how it is managed. TP confirmed Al
Cameron would be in charge, and leading on this and that they were
fortunate to have him, as he knows the company very well. TP
informed KT that in terms of advice, they had two senior QCs and could
not expect to have a better advocate. However when it comes to
deciding on whether they should appeal they will look to get an
independent person, and their lawyers feel that there is good grounds
to appeal.

* They discussed the franchising programme and that as a board they
believe it will improve the sustainability of the Post Office. TP said that
they were looking at ways of improving the rewards for postmasters,
such as the NSSP that looks at the banking framework and creates more
work for postmasters. As part of this, their remuneration would
increase. KT said she defends the franchising programme and the Post
Office, however needs to have comfort and confidence that when there
is feedback for them, they are actioned. She then gave an example of a
recent franchising issue brought to her attention. Al Cameron provided
an update on the banking framework. KT offered her assistance and
informed POL that she was happy to put pressure on the banks if
required, and help remove any blocks. She mentioned that she had
spoken recently with HMT Ministers to get them to put some pressure
on the banks.

* KT asked about their legal team defending their positions and advice.
She asked whether there would be any change of strategy on dealing
with the horizon litigation. JM provided an update of the four separate
trials. The Horizon trial driven by evidence and by independent
witnesses (appointed on each side) she then went on to explain the
various evidence that will be taken into account. They discussed the
two trials in November and how the judge wants to look at issues of
limitation. The judge wants an answer on whether the limitation act
applies to these trials. The fourth trial will be looking at representative
claimants and breaches; this will be a conventional trial process. The
judge has dictated the sequencing of the questions; therefore POL’s
strategy is how to respond to these questions. Al Cameron said as they
will be receiving new advice from a different QC this will bring forward
other perspectives, the quality of this advice will guide their thinking of
their strategy.

* KT reiterated that it was incredibly important in her view that as
much information is shared with us as possible. She requested a
detailed update next week after the board meeting, to know what the
board’s strategy is and what their next steps are in taking this forward.
Al Cameron was more than happy to brief the Minister on updates as
and when appropriate — whether that be weekly in person or via phone
to ensure she has the close oversight she has requested. Which KT
appreciated and will follow up with them if she has any additional

UKG100009261
UKGI00009261
UKG100009261
UKGI00009261

questions.

* Lastly KT said she was concerned that Paula resigning will be
perceived negatively, considering she has taken on another role that
has been publicised. Therefore would like to understand the exact
recruitment process to get a new CEO and for this to be set out clearly.
As having this in place will help to defend possible criticisms and
speculation. Al Cameron confirmed they will share this.

Dear Colleague,

Postmasters are the backbone of the Post Office, and their
branches are the backbone of communities across the country.
That’s why we committed to safeguarding the post office
network and protecting existing rural services. The overall
number of post offices across the UK remains at its most stable
in decades with over 11,500 branches thanks to significant

Government investment of over £2 billion.

The Post Office and I are fully supportive of this legal case being
brought. This first judgment, which deals with the contractual

relationship between the Post Office and

postmasters,I

The judge has been highly critical of the Post Office’s handling of
the case and finds the Post Office’s conduct in its dealings with
the lead claimant postmasters have been heavy-handed, some
of its operations insufficiently transparent, and its procedures

and processes lacking in consistency and professionalism.

The judgement is complex and lengthy and the Post Office will

acknowledged the criticism, are taking it very seriously, and will

be taking appropriate action where necessary.

Legal proceedings in this case are currently scheduled to
continue until at least March 2020. Whilst this remains a matter

for the court and it is not appropriate for Government to
comment further. However, I will be remaining in close contact
with the Post Office over the coming weeks and months as they

deliver on their commitments to improve.

I understand that this issue will be of interest and concern to
Members of the House and, as this process progresses, I will

update Members further.

This isn’t correct:

“represents a significant step forward, delivering justice for

those postmasters who have been wronged.”

It would be accurate to say “...significant step towards

delivering justice...”

I’m out of action for the rest of the day.

Gavin - would you be able to share with POL? Expect resistance

from their lawyers.

Please see a modified version from Kelly below,
she would like to see a redraft and is aware that

Will had further comments.

Grateful if you could review and provide an
updated draft.

Thank you.

Dear Colleague,

Postmasters are the backbone of the Post Office,
and their branches are the backbone of
communities across the country. That’s why we
committed to safeguarding the post office network

and protecting existing rural services. The overall
number of post offices across the UK remains at its
most stable in decades with over 11,500 branches
thanks to significant Government investment of
over £2 billion.

The Post Office and I are fully supportive of this
legal case being brought. This first judgment,
which deals with the contractual relationship
between the Post Office and postmasters,
represents a significant step forward, delivering
justice for those postmasters who have been

wronged.

The judge has been highly critical of the Post
Office’s handling of the case and finds the Post
Office’s conduct in its dealings with the lead
claimant postmasters have been heavy-handed,
some of its operations insufficiently transparent,
and its procedures and processes lacking in

consistency and professionalism.

The judgement is complex and lengthy and the
Post Office will need time to consider in detail,
however having spoken today with the Chairman
of POL, I am assured they have acknowledged the
criticism, are taking it very seriously, and will be

taking appropriate action where necessary.

Legal proceedings in this case are currently
scheduled to continue until at least March 2020.
Whilst this remains a matter for the court and it is
not appropriate for Government to comment
further. However, I will be remaining in close
contact with the Post Office over the coming
weeks and months as they deliver on their

commitments to improve.

I understand that this issue will be of interest and

concern to Members of the House and, as this

process progresses, I will update Members further.

Ok, can we go with this instead (reinserted in the

same place)?

Our objective is that those people who were

wronged to get the justice they deserve.

Just discussed with Tom and think it might be
better to stick with the wording agreed before
Will's suggested change. I understand the
issue of PM's getting justice for valid claims
was important to SoS

Sorry. I actually think the opposite. As drafted it looks

more like we agree with the judgement than before.
What we’ve now also lost is the SOS’s wish to
communicate that we want postmasters who have

been done wrong to get justice.
