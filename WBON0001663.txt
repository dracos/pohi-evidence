Rodric
Thanks. On my three actions below.

We've amended the attached draft of the paper to include a summary of Section M in the body of the paper and added
a new appendix with the answers to each Horizon Issue. This has been taken from my email last night.

Happy to address verbally at the meeting the advice on appeal and costs (as per our email this morning)

Happy with the wording on contract reform and with sharing the Workshop paper.

Thanks
A

v. Comms / PR timings
vi. Budget implications — review Change budget

vii. Considerations to Funding Agreement Negotiations

12/12/19

GE December Meeting — GLO paper (covering the above)

We need to liaise with Patrick to ensure that we can issue the joint statement in alignment with our authority

When can I see a finalised version of the settlement document that we are going to send to the otherside so I
can socialise with Nick and Tom
