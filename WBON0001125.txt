Thanks, Amy.

I can’t print out the picture of the table you have inserted into your email — for some reason my computer
cuts off the right hand side of the table (see below). Never mind.

A few questions:

. What is the table you have pictured and inserted in your email? Is that a picture of a postmaster’s
account? Yes, postmaster's account. The entries have been filtered to show those which have been settled
centrally.

2. What is the table you have attached to your email — is that a picture of a postmaster’s account (and
why does it refer to a customer rather than a postmaster, by the way)? Yes but showing all items on the
account — referred to as customer due to the set-up of the software.

3. If the answers to I and 2 are both yes, why are the two tables different?
Both examples relate to the account of a branch. The example attached shows all items on the account

(irrespective of open/cleared/disputed) whereas the one in the email below has been filtered to show sums
which have been settled centrally.

4. In the table inserted in your email:
a. could you give us the full names of the column currently marked “S...” and “DD”; and

S = status

DD = Net Due Date symbol. If the status column is "open", the DD column will show whether payment
is not due, due or overdue. If the status is "cleared" then there would be no entry in the DD column.

b. could you tell us what an entry would look like if it wasn’t blocked — would it have no red blobs
or marks in the “S...” and “DD” columns, and would the blocked column be blank?

« The Status and Due Date symbol columns are system driven, the block column is used by FSC
to note a dispute.

« If the status is "cleared" there would be no DD entry (since the shortfall would have been paid),
but there could be an old block remaining which shows there was historically a dispute.

= If the status is "open" (has not been paid) there would be a DD entry and there will only be a
block if FSC have received a dispute.

= An item which is not blocked would have no entry in the block column but would still have an
entry in the status column (depending on whether payment is outstanding) and may have an
entry in the DD column (depending on when payment was/is due).

5. In your attached explanation of abbreviations, does TX signify a TC which is being disputed and is
accordingly being settled centrally and blocked pending resolution of the dispute? If not, which
abbreviation signifies that situation?

The TX abbreviation would be used when a TC has been settled centrally, whether it is disputed or not. If the
TC is being disputed, then a block would be placed on the entry to show that it is a disputed TC.

POL do use different blocks codes to annotate the type of dispute (i.e. all former accounts are permanently
blocked and the different blocks show where the case is, such as everything blocked with an F is a BAU case,
N notifies it is a Freeths case, H is a credit to be repaid via HR).

Similarly, in the below example the column titled ‘block’ shows an item marked with an 'R ‘ which means that
this amount is already set up to be deducted from remuneration and therefore blocked for any further request
for payment and the items marked with an M relates to a miskey error where the agent is waiting for a TC, so
this will remain blocked until the enquiry is completed.

Best wishes,

Tony

gs applied to accounts where disputed sum settled centrally [BD-

Dear Tony, Owain

Briefing note on flags which are applied to SPMR accounts where disputed sum settled centrally

Where an item has been settled centrally and disputed, the agent accounting team apply a dunning block to the open
item on the account. This prevents any further requests for payment being sent to the agent.

The account below shows (in the column titled "block")

¢ the item marked with an R is already set up to be deducted from remuneration and therefore blocked for any
further request for payment; and

¢ the items marked with an M relates to a miskey error where the agent is waiting for a TC, so this will remain
blocked until the enquiry is completed.

The effect of placing these blocks on the system is to prevent a dunning letter (chaser letter) being produced and/or
preventing the item from falling on a processors worklist for further action.

Please also find attached an example of a customer account and an explanation of the abbreviations which are used
in this.

If you would like any further information on this please let me know.

Kind regards
