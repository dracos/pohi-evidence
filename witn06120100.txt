                                                                                WITN06120100




5. I held various positions during my career in POL, from Administration Grade to

   Senior Manager, dealing initially with checking of supporting documents for the

   savings stamps product at an administration grade, to then management roles

   dealing with: reconciliation of accounts and managing the introduction of the

   Lottery in 1994; I went on to manage two teams in London: Data Processing

   reconciliations for cheque processing and facilities management for the site

   (POL processed the cheques from Branches in Data Central in London) and

   three Exceptions teams in Chesterfield, issuing error notices for TV Licences,

   Automated Payments and Personal Banking. I was not working in 1999/2000

   (sick leave / maternity leave) and then on maternity leave late 2000/2001. I then

   returned to a Decision Support role managing budgetary costs, and then onto

   an operational support role to reduce costs and make efficiencies with respect

   to process improvements and staff reduction, I am unable to remember the

   exact timeline for all the roles I held.



6. In 2004 to 2007 1 was promoted to a senior manager role called Operation

   Manager. There were twelve managers in the area managing two Exceptions

   areas and Data preparation teams (teams were dealing with enquiries and

   issuing error notices and keying Cash accounts and supporting document) until

   the Impact Programme automated the Horizon and Client feeds in 2005 and

   TCs were then issued.



7. From 2007 to 2018 - with the exception of 2015 when I was seconded to a

   Recruitment project and another person temporally managed my area - I was

   the Senior Debt Recovery manager within Product and Branch Accounting

   (P&BA) then the FSC. The role did have various tiles during that time but for

   ease I will refer to it during this statement as the Senior Debt Recovery

   Manager. At this time, I was primarily managing the following areas.

         known as Agent Accounting Team ("AAT") (From 2007 to 2018).

      b) Fraud and Conformance Team (From 2007 to 2012). The team was split

         in 2012 and some of the work moved to the Security Team. The team

         reviewed various areas for abnormal patterns, non-conformance or high

         overnight cash holdings, and escalated to various area within the

         business Network, Security and The Cash Inventory team.

      c) Vehicle Excise Recovery (VER) (From 2012 - 2014) recovery of unpaid

         cheques for the DVLA for Car Tax — this work was passed back to the

      e) Open Item and Enquiry Teams (From 2016 — 2021) Open item Teams

         that led to the issue of TC's and Enquiries from Branches and Clients.



8. In 2018 the Current and Former Agents Team were transferred to another area

   within the Network Operational Support Team.



9. As the Senior Debt Recovery Manager, within P&BA/the FSC from 2007 to

   2018, my key responsibilities were:

10. From 2018 until I retired in 2021, I was a Senior Manager within the Network

   Operations Support Team; the FSC was split and the area I then managed was

   renamed Branch Reconciliation Team (BRT) but I will continue to use FSC

   throughout this statement to help with flow and reading. From 2018 I was

managing the following areas which dealt with enquiries, issued TCs and

ensured TA delivery to the Branches:

A) The Enquiries Team: Received enquiries from Branches and Clients for

   Automated Payments (bill payment) Banking and Bureau transactions.

   These enquiries were generally for miskeyed transactions in branches. If a

   miskey was reported by the Branch the team would liaise with Clients/

   Banks_ The Clients / Banks would discuss the miskeyed transaction with

   their customers and if the customer agreed to the repayment of a miskeyed

   transaction they informed the FSC Enquiry team, and a credit TC would be

   issued to branch and the settlement to the Client adjusted. If the customer

   did not agree, then the Branch would be informed by the FSC Enquiry Team

   that the customer refused to refund the money, this would leave the loss in

   the branch. This team also managed TAs and Enquiries for Paystation.

B) The Open Item teams x 3 These were for open item general ledgers where

   two streams of data (Horizon data from branches, and Client/Supplier data)

   were matched and TCs issued. The matched products were:

     i.    Cash remittances

    ii.    Bureau remittances

    iii.   ATM

    iv.    Lottery Prizes Matching account (TA for Scratch Cards and Online

           Game)

    v.     Cheques to processing and Cheques held at site (Cheques held in

           branch and not dispatched for processing)

    vi.    Unpaid cheques, Cheques returned by Banks as an unpaid item. If

           the Branch had followed the correct procedure and annotated the

                                                                                    WITN06120100




                   reverse of the cheque with the product details, the values were

                   deducted from the settlement with the Client and the cheques sent

                   onto the client to reinstate the Bill or chase their customers for

                   payment. If the branch had not annotated the reverse of the cheque,

                   the FSC would investigate, but if they were unable to confirm the

                   Client then a TC would be issued.

           vii.    Debit cards

           viii.   Moneygram

            ix.    Control Account Management for: Local Suspense, Loan to PO,

                   Cash Holdings (declared vs generated cash figure)

             x.    Missing cheques, these were chased with the Customers for

                   payments after liaising with the Branch

       After investigation, an unmatched item could lead to a transaction correction

       ("TC") being issued to the branches. I will return to explain this more, below. I

       will use paragraph headings in this statement to assist with clarity and for ease

       of reference.




Contractual liability

   11. 1 have been asked to address my recollection of the contractual liability of

       subpostmasters for shortfalls. I have been referred to the following documents,

       which I have read for the purposes of this statement. I had no knowledge of

       the documents listed at a — e below at the time of my employment, as these

       was prior to my tenure in the Senior Debt Recovery role in 2007.

      b) "Losses and gains policy within the POCL agency network" (version 1,

         20 November 1998) (POL00088904) (in particular paragraph 3.1);

         as the policy's later iterations at POL00086868, POL00088579,

         P0L00090357 and P01-00088312.

   I had no knowledge of the documents listed at a — e above at the time of my

   employment, as these was prior to my tenure in the Senior Debt Recovery role

   in 2007.




12. Due to my role as Senior Debt Recovery Manager, I was involved in the input

   and review of the policy "Operators' in service debt". I recall working on this,

   primarily with my colleagues Paul Inwood and then Ravi Chauhan (Contracts

   and Policy Advisor), John Breeden, Lin Norbury and Andrew Carpenter (The

                                  Page 7 of 46

   Network Contracts Managers). The policy was developed and used with the

   Network Contact Managers, and I referred to this policy in review meetings with

   Network Contract Managers.



13. My understanding of Postmasters' Contract Liability for shortfalls was that the

   Postmaster was liable for any losses of Post Office cash and stock incurred

   through negligence, carelessness or error by themselves or their Post Office

   assistants.



14. 1 have been asked about the Post Office policy on the responsibility of

   employees within Crown Offices for shortfalls or "losses" identified in a Crown

   Office, and whether that differed from the policy on the responsibility of SPMs

   for shortfalls for "losses" identified within their branches. I have been referred

   to the documents below, but I have no recollection of needing to refer to them

   at the time of my employment (as they related to Crown Offices), These Policies

   were written by the Security Team and FSC were not engaged in the writing or

   deployment of the polices as far as I am aware:

      a) "Mandatory Losses & Gains Policy Crown Office Network" (September

          2008) (POL00088124);

      b) "Mandatory Losses & Gains Policy Crown Office Network" (version 1.0,

          24 April 2013) (POL00088124).



15. The FSC debt recovery area I led and had responsibility for did not act to

   recover debts from Crown Branch employees. The losses and transaction

   corrections for Crown Branches were accepted in Branch and posted directly

      to profit & loss accounts and managed by the Network Finance

      Analysts/Network Teams and the Security & Investigations Team.



Role of the Financial Services Centre (FSC)

   16. 1 have been asked about the role of the Financial Services Centre and the

      policies / practices in place when I worked within it. I have been asked to

      address the role which the FSC played and the policies / practices in place

      relating   to   error    notices/transaction    corrections   ("TCs"),   transaction

      acknowledgements ("TAs"), branch discrepancies and recovery of debt from in

      service and former SPMs. I have been referred to the following documents:

         a. "Losses at SPSO's: Guidelines on responsibilities and recovery

             arrangements" (understood to be issued in 1988) (POL00083939) (in

         of my employment, as these was prior to my tenure in the Senior Debt

          Recovery role in 2007.



   17. By way of background first, pre 2005, nothing in relation to the cash account

      was automated in branches. The Postmaster completed a paper cash account

      and sent materials in hard copy in a pouch to Chesterfield and the branch

      received paper error notices. On the implementation of the Impact Programme

      in late 2005, an automated service was introduced whereby the branches

      completed a branch trading statement on Horizon and received electronic

      transaction correction (TCs) directly to the Horizon terminal. Transactions were

      summarised daily and fed into vendor accounts in the SAP system (POLSAP)

      to pay the Clients for transaction completed in branch for their products. Some

      of the products also fed an Open Item general ledger from Horizon and were

      matched in the SAP system (POLSAP), i.e. the data from Horizon was matched

      to the Client / supplier data.



Transaction Corrections ("TCs") - overview

   18.A Transaction Correction, "TC" is an electronic message with a narrative as to

      the reason for the accounting correction. A branch would have entered their

                                                                                  WITNO6120100
                                                                                WITN06120100




   transactions into Horizon; these were summarised by branch, daily, and that

   information fed into the POLSAP system, using unique product IDs. These

   accounts for matched items were known as open item accounts. TCs were

   issued on these accounts by postal officer grades, i.e. FSC staff (based in

   Chesterfield) to correct differences in the accounts balance if there were

   mismatches.



19. The open item accounts were fed by two streams of data, one from the Branch

   via Horizon and the other stream from a Client, Cash Centre or Supplier that

   processed items, such as the Cash Centres, Camelot, ATM, Cheques, Debit

   Cards and Moneygram. The open items accounts were matched daily, any

   mismatched or unmatched amounts were investigated to give evidence and

   narrative for a TC to be issued.



20. When TCs were generated, the narrative as to the reason for the TC would be

   given, as well as a name and contact number of the issuer, should the branch

   wish to discuss the TC further. If there was evidence available to a TC, this was

   sent to the branch by post or email to support the TC. The narrative for Cash

   and Bureau remittances were provided by the Cash Centre Teams.



21.TC's could be both credits and debits, and approximately 125,000 were issued

   per year. TC's could be issued individually to branches or to multiple branches

   via a bulk upload in POLSAP. TC's for cash remittances were the highest

   volume for remittances from the branch, these were for both shortages and

      surpluses and the Cash Centres provided the narrative for the TC with respect

      to the reason for the TC.



Transaction Acknowledgments ("TAs") - overview
   22. Transaction Acknowledgements ("TA's") were introduced around 2012, and the

      introduction was known internally as the 'ping project'. I was not managing the

      open item teams at this time. TA's were introduced to reduce the number of

      TC's that were being issued for equipment (kit) not linked to Horizon. TAs would

      be used, for example, for the Camelot Lottery terminal/Paystation terminal

      transactions.



   23.A TA was different to a TC in a number of respects. TAs were issued by

      Atos/Accenture (the IT supplier), not by the FSC. The TA's were generated

      and issued by the IT supplier from a file received from the Post Office Client,

      for daily transactions by branch by product type I.e. for the Lottery the branch

      would get two TAs one for on-line sales and one for scratchcard activations.



   24. The purpose of the TA was for the branch to confirm / acknowledge the value

      transacted by the branch was correct; the branch could check the values of the

      transactions on the Lottery terminal by day before accepting a TA in Horizon

      and putting the cash into the till to balance.



Error Notices - overview

   25. Error notices were issued by postal officers (based in Chesterfield), pre 2005.

      My general knowledge of the process was as follows.


                                      Page 12 of 46
                                                                                   WITNO6120100
                                                                                 WITN06120100




   26. The branches sent in a weekly paper cash account and supporting documents

      in a pouch to Chesterfield. The cash account was keyed to the system, the

      supporting documents were checked and also keyed to the system, any

      mismatches were investigated and a paper "Error notice" was sent to the

      branch. The branch accepted the error notice by entering the error notice on

      the cash account (known as bringing the error to account), Once the cash

      account with the error notice on had been keyed, it would clear the differences

      from the system.



Disputes:
   27.A branch could dispute an Error notice, and later a TC, raising this with the

      issuer. A branch could dispute a TA, raising it via the NBSC to the FSC teams.



The IMPACT programme

   28. 1 have been asked for my recollection of matters connected to the IMPACT

      Programme. I was not involved in the design of the Impact Programme. The

      Impact Programme primary objectives, I believe, were to automate the

      accounting / Back-office processes and to reduce costs.        It involved the

      introduction of a new 'end to end' accounting process via Horizon and

      reconciliation of the account being completed on a new SAP system (POLSAP).

      I have been referred to the following documents:

            a) the witness statement of Susan Harding at WITNO3980100, paragraphs

               23 to 32);




                                    Page 13 of 46

                                                                                WITNO6120100




      b) 'Losses and gains policy within the POOL agency network' (version 1,

         20 November 1998) (POL00088904) (in particular, section 1, part 2

         'Authority To Hold Losses In Unclaimed Payments');

      c) 'Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Accounting losses policy for agency

         branches' (version 1, February 2003) (POL00086845) (in particular,

         section 3 — 'Authority to Hold Losses');

      d) 'Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Liability for losses policy (for agency

         branches)' (version 1.7, September 2003) (POL00088867) (in particular,

         section 3 — 'Authority to Hold Losses');

      e) The letter at page 2 of NFSP00000169.

   I am unable to comment on items b — e as these were prior to my tenure in the

   Senior Debt Recovery role in 2007. Another Senior Manager in FSC would have

   been involved in these and the management of disputes and Debt Recovery

   (Jenifer Robson and then Marie Cockett).



29. When the automation via the Impact programme was introduced, it was not a

   smooth transition. There were many issues flagged to the Programme and a

   team of Managers/consultants called the 'Red Team', managed by the

   Programme, were brought into FSC to support the resolution. Issues such as

   products being mapped to the wrong accounts were identified and then

   resolved. FSC at the time (2005) was running a dual system, closing down the

   Exceptions from the Cash Account process and working on the new accounts

   in the new SAP (POLSAP) system.




                                 Page 14 of 46
                                                                                     WITNO6120100
                                                                                   WITN06120100




30. Susan Harding (WITN03980100 para 23,24,31) states that the local suspense

   account which had previously been available to SPMs to hold losses until they

   removed them, is said to have been removed. The Local suspense is actually

   still available to branches to use when they complete their daily / weekly

   balance, but it is not available to hold losses or surpluses for long periods of

   time or on a permanent basis as branches may have done previously.



31.The change in 2005 by the Impact Programme was that the local suspense

   needs to be cleared at branch trading, creating a Branch discrepancy with the

   option to the branch to declare the shortage / surplus as a branch discrepancy

   and Settle Centrally (if over £150) or to make good by Cash or Cheque (for

   Shortages) or remove Cash (for Surpluses). Local suspense does feed into the

   POLSAP accounts.



32. A reconciliation of the local suspense accounts is completed by FSC after the

   branch trading date. The reconciliation would only establish if there were any

   values left in local suspense. If values were left in local suspense, this of itself

   would indicate that the branch had not completed their branch trading.

   It was at this point that FSC would investigate or even refer to another area with

   relevant responsibility. The investigation purpose would be to assess why there

   was a value left in local suspense, and/or why a branch had not completed

   branch trading. FSC Investigation/escalation would be focussed on:

      a. Escalation to the Network Teams to enable branch training to complete

          the branch trading statement;

                                                                                   WITN06120100




          b. Understanding if there was a fundamental problem with the Horizon kit

             in branch and the branch was closed, e.g. had it been permanently

             damaged in branch (by a fire);

          c. If the Horizon kit had been removed from the branch due to problems

             with the terminal and balances had not been completed. (FSC would not

             be involved in the reason why the kit had been removed or have

             instigated its removal);

          d. Establishing if the branch had unexpectedly closed without balancing

             and Network support or intervention was required.



   33. 1 have been asked about my recollections as of October 2005 (this is by

      reference to the date of the guidance "Debt Recovery Processes under Branch

      Trading" at P0L00085794). I believe this was sent out to the branches as a

      communication. I will address in more detail than above TCs and the process

      involved for disputes.




TC's — process for disputes

   34. A branch was provided, where available, evidence with a TC and so were able

      to review any evidence they had in branch, around the transaction. For TC's,

      the first avenue for support or resolution would normally be for the branch to go

      to the issuer of the TC, using the contact detail /name on the TC.



   35. If a postmaster received a TC that they did not understand and they wanted

      further explanation, they could call the issuer of the TC whose details were on

      the TC or call the NBSC for support and guidance or escalation to FSC.

                                        Page 16 of 46
                                                                                  WI TN06120100
                                                                                WITNO6120100




36. If a postmaster wished to dispute a TC they received after speaking to the

   issuer, they were advised by the issuer to do so first in writing to the FSC

   Relationship Manager (Andrew Winn held this post I believe from 2008 to

   2016). I am unable to remember the date this advice was introduced, but I

   believe that there was a communication to branches around 2008/9 with

   respect to this. The Relationship Manager role was put into FSC to ensure

   someone other than the TC issuer or their manager reviewed all disputes, to

   ensure an unbiased review was completed and a response was given to the

   Postmaster in writing. The dispute was requested to be sent in writing to ensure

   the Relationship Manager understood the reason for the dispute and if needed

   gain further clarity by talking to the postmaster. A postmaster could dispute a

   TC even if they had accepted/settled centrally the TC, which would usually have

   been due to Branch Trading time constraints. The Relationship Manager would

   then "block the debt" (if the postmaster had settled centrally) and then complete

   an investigation with respect to the dispute. The FSC Relationship Manager

   would correspond with the Postmaster on the outcome, all letters received, and

   the responses were held in a file (hard copy) and later a central computer drive

   (Sharepoint) in FSC. If a call was made to the NBSC on the branch trading day

   to dispute the TC, the TC would need to be accepted to allow the branch to

   complete branch trading. The branch - albeit being required to accept and

   settle centrally - within the document POL00085794 it states that if this was

   done, a reference number was then passed to FSC who would block the debt

   whilst an investigation was completed. I am unable to confirm or remember

   details with respect to the branch being supplied with a reference number in

   2005 as I was not in the Senior Debt Recovery Role at that time. For cash

                                  Page 17 of 46

                                                                                    WITNO6120100




      remittance disputes the Relationship Manager would contact the Cash Centres

      who were able to review camera footage of the remittance and validate the

      error. If Branches still did not believe that there was a shortage in the

      remittance, a request could be made for the Branch to view the footage of the

      remittance being counted in the Cash Centre.

TA's — process for disputes

   37. If a TA was disputed — e.g. for Camelot - the FSC could request evidence from

      Camelot with respect to the activity on the lottery terminal. Generally, these

      disputes, in my experience, were caused by the lottery summary on the terminal

      in branch being printed prior to the close of business (and transactions

      happening after printing but before closing).



Error Notices pre 2005 — process for dispute.

   38. The Error Notices could still be disputed and/or discussed with the issuer. I am

      unable to clarify or give further details of the process for disputing an error

      notice as the debt recovery process / disputes resolution sat with another

      Senior Manager pre-2005, I believe it was Jennifer Robson.



Postmaster discovery of deficiency/surplus — support available and process

   39. 1 should add that, in addition to a TC or a TA, which were means of notifications

      to a branch, if a postmaster discovered a deficiency or surplus in the amount of

      cash held when balancing the branch account, they were able to escalate the

      issue and discuss this by contacting the NBSC for guidance, support and help

      in the first instance. I am unable to expand on what the staff in the NBSC would

      do next and their processes. I am also unable to confirm what actions the NBSC


                                     Page 18 of 46
                                                                                       WI TN06120100
                                                                                     WITNO6120100




      took If a branch rang the NBSC about a discrepancy that they believed to have

      been caused by Horizon therefore input would be needed by NBSC on this.



  40. The Branch in 2005 also had access to a Retail Network Manager to gain

      support.



  41.If the discrepancy amount was over £150, the branch did not have to seek

      authority to `settle centrally' (see further below) and the discrepancy recorded

      and settled centrally could all be done in branch. I cannot expand or explain

      why the amount was set at £150. I was not involved in these processes or

      decisions around setting the £150 amount for Settle Centrally as I was not in

      the Senior Debt Recovery managers position in 2005.




Settling Centrally

  42. I have been asked about the process for "Settling Centrally" and referred to the

      document dated 14 November 2008 entitled "TC/Debt Recovery Review" at

      POL00026854.



  43. "Settling Centrally" was a process that enabled branches to set aside

      debit/credit TC's and branch discrepancies / shortages and surpluses over

      £150, and not put the cash in the till or take surpluses out to balance the

      account. The values when settled centrally were allocated to a customer

      account that was specific to the branch and postmaster. If a branch chose to

      settle centrally it did not always signify an acceptance of the debt. If a debit TC

      or branch discrepancy shortage leading to a debt was settled centrally, the

                                     Page 19 of 46
                                                                                      WITNO6120100
                                                                                    WITN06120100




      branch could still dispute when 'Dunning letters/statements' were sent to the

      branch and the debt blocked for further investigation. (Dunning letters were

      part of the 'Dunning process', a standard functionality in SAP for chasing

      outstanding debt). The comment in the document POL00026854 were made by

      the legal team with respect to "Settle Centrally" in this document it stated,

      "Settle Centrally signifies acceptance of debt liability, forcing TC acceptance on

      the same day as receipt through branch trading requirements would probably

      be regarded as unreasonable by a court of law and cause a related claim to

      fail".

      Actions were put in place with the FSC TC issuing teams after this meeting for

      the TC issuer to check the date of branch trading and not issue TCs on a

      Tuesday that would arrive at the branches on the branch trading day unless this

      was requested by the branch.

      If a debt/credit had a blocking code assigned in POLES, the amount would not

      be chased via the Dunning Process and the system distinguished blocked items

      from open items on the customer accounts.




Branch discrepancies

   44. In the simplest form, the phrase "branch discrepancy" was used to explain the

      situation when the value of transaction did not accurately equate or record the

      cash taken from or given to the customer. Effectively a shortage or surplus in

      cash in the branch vs the transactions the Branch had completed on Horizon.



   45. Branch discrepancies could be /occur in the following circumstances:


                                     Page 20 of 46
                                                                                      WI TN06120100
                                                                                    WITNO6120100




         a. A miskeyed transaction is entered, for example a deposit for £100 is

            keyed as £1000; this would equate to a £900 shortage/discrepancy;

         b. An Incorrect product icon is selected in branch e.g. a customer requests

            a £500 withdraw of cash but the branch completed a deposit for £500

            into the customer's account. This would equate to a £1000 shortage;

         c. Incorrect change is given to a customer;

         d. Incorrect value of cash is noted in a remittance back to the cash centre;

         e. A remittance of cash received in branch was booked in on Horizon but

            the pouch was in the safe and not counted as part of the balancing

            process.

      Branch discrepancies could also occur due to TC/TA processes, when:

         e. A TC is accepted but the cash is not put in the till;

         f. A TA is accepted, and the cash is not put in the till.




System issues raised by Branches to NBSC

   46. FSC worked with the NBSC if multiple branches raised the same queries. Some

      of these were referred to as system issues, and these would be escalated to

      the POL IT service desk and onto the IT suppliers (ATOS/Accenture) for

      investigation. Examples of these could be

         a) Non arrival of TAs in branch for lottery / paystation. This could be as a

            result of a failure to send the file out to branches by the IT supplier, as

            they may not have received the file from the client; or the file format sent

            by the client was in the wrong format and would need to be resent. The

            FSC would have visibility of this in the general ledger and control checks

            were in place to check TAs had been sent to branches daily.

                                     Page 21 of 46

                                                                              WITN06120100




      b) Duplicate TA's issued for the same dates. I have only known of this on

          one occasion whilst managing the Open item teams (from 2016): the IT

          supplier, Accenture loaded and sent duplicate/triplicate TA's for the

          lottery. As they had been loaded and sent to the branches, the solution

          was to issue correcting credit TC's to offset the duplicate / triplicate

          values.

      c) Duplicate TC's for the same value. I recall these were caused by human

          error on two occasions whilst I managed the open item teams, when an

          upload file of TC's was sent out twice. These were corrected by

          compensating TC's and additional controls and training was put in place.



47.Although the above scenarios were rare, a "memo view" was sent on Horizon

   to the affected branches, informing them of the issue and corrective action

   taken to resolve the issue. A memo view is simply an electronic message

   posted onto Horizon. Memo views would have to be agreed first with the

   communications team before sending to the branch.



48.The examples I have given above are examples of "system issues" that were

   not Horizon system errors, bugs etc. The examples I have given above are

   more those that were caused by IT suppliers/Clients for TA's, and human error

   for TC's.



49. There were only a few occasions that I can remember that I came across branch

   trading problems due to what may now be referred as a Horizon bug (although

   I do not remember it being called a Horizon bug at the time). I believe these

   were for Receipts and Payments mismatches issues. I am however afraid that

   I cannot recall the details of these as the issues were managed by Rod Ismay

   (Head of FSC) and Andrew Winn (FSC Relationship Manager). I was not aware

   of widespread issues or names for Horizon bugs at the time. The iT Service

   Management helpdesk would need to be contacted to give details of these

   issues, there specific cause and the resolution that was supported by the FSC.



50. 1 do have recollection of instances when the FSC was engaged by NBSC / iT

   Service Management Helpdesk. If a problem was reported by the branch with

   respect to a specific transaction issue that would need intervention by Fujitsu,

   these were managed by the iT Service Management Helpdesk FSC would be

   engaged and would review if there was a financial impact on the branch prior

   to giving agreement for Fujitsu intervention. I believed that this was a controlled

   process that had to have sign off from Post Office before any intervention by

   Fujitsu. I am unable to remember the details of these scenarios, or their cause

   and detailed input would be needed from Rod Ismay (Head of FSC), Andrew

   Winn (Relationship Manager) and the iT Service Management Helpdesk Team

   who were involved and managed these issues with Fujitsu. As mentioned

   above, to the best of my knowledge these were not referred to as `Horizon bugs'

   at the time.



51. 1 have been asked to consider if it was satisfactory that SPMs were required to

   "settle centrally" even where they disputed a TC / TA / discrepancy.

                                                                                   WITN06120100




52. Settled Centrally was in place due to how the Horizon system operated with

   respect to balancing the branch. By settling centrally, the branch would not have

   to put in the cash for losses or hold any surpluses; once settled centrally the

   branch could still dispute the debt. I believed that this was satisfactory as if this

   had not been in place the TCs and discrepancies could have been held in

   branch and they could potentially have been ignored.


53. 1 have been asked if I agree that the process for challenging TCs / TAs /

   discrepancies meant that a deficiency or "loss" was assumed to have been

   caused by an error or wrongdoing on the part of an SPM, unless they proved

   otherwise.



54. 1 did believe that a discrepancy was caused by an error within the branch, and

   these could be both losses and surpluses, as I always believed that Horizon

   was accurate and there was not the ability for external influence or changes in

   the branch account unless via a managed and controlled change re para 50

   above. I did not believe that all occasions were "wrongdoing", but some may

   have been.



55. 1 have been asked to set out the role played by FSC when a SPM challenged

   a TC / TA! discrepancy through the NBSC helpline and referred to the following

   document: paragraph 3.11 of the "Working agreement — `Finance Service

   Centre and Network" (version 2.12, undated) at POL00088897).



56. 1 have covered many of the interactions with the NBSC in the above

   paragraphs.

   57. If NBSC sent a query via email or by calling the FSC for a challenged TCITA

      FSC would investigate and respond to the branch or back to NBSC within a

      targeted 10 working days.



   58. 1 have covered system issues raised to the NBSC at para 46-50.



   59.Additionally covered in the working agreement POL00088897, FSC also

      supplied data to the Network Team of all TCs issued in the month, also

      highlighting the branches with the highest number of TCs. This was supplied to

      the Network Team to enable them to address non-conformance in the branches

      or give support and training.



   60. FSC supported NBSC with the knowledge base scripts used by the NBSC

      advisors when taking calls from branches to ensure they accurately reflected

      the products.

Current agent process

   62.A "Current Agent" is a postmaster in branch today. Recovery from current

      agents was managed and undertaken by the Current Agents Team - a team I

      managed from 2007 to 2018.



   63. TC's and branch discrepancies that were settled centrally in branch and created

      a debt or surplus were assigned to a customer account in POLSAP. The

      customer account was specific to the branch and postmaster.




                                    Page 26 of 46
                                                                                 WI TN06120100
                                                                               WITNO6120100




64. Branches were placed in different trading groups over a 4 week period, group

   A being the first week, group B the second week, group C the third week and

   group D the fourth week in the month.



65. Monthly, one week after the branch trading group had completed their balance

   (Branch Trading Statement) the Current Agents Team ran a `Dunning process'

   for the trading group. The Dunning process is automated in POLFS and

   generates letters and statements for outstanding debt that has not been

   blocked. The Dunning process takes things in stages.



66. The first letter and statement issued under the Dunning process would be sent

   one week after branch trading. The first letter/statement would ask for payment,

   or the postmaster to contact the team the Current Agents Team to discuss / pay

   the debt.



67. If the postmaster did not contact the Current Agents Team, a second

   letter/statement would be sent, 3 weeks after branch trading.



68. If no contact was made by the Postmaster, calls would then be attempted to

   contact the branch and speak to the postmaster. Four calls would be attempted

   if the debt was over £1000. Two calls would be attempted if the debt was under

   £1000.



69. For debts under £1000, if the team were unable to contact the branch after two

   call attempts, then a third letter was sent to advise the branch that the debt


                                 Page 27 of 46
                                                                                   WITNO6120100
                                                                                 WITN06120100




   would be taken from postmaster remuneration, either in one go or taken in

   instalments. Repayment would not be taken for the whole of the debt if it

   equated to more than 25% of the Postmasters remuneration hence why

   instalment plans were set up. Any letters sent advising that payments were

   being taken would include contact numbers, so the branch could call prior to

   any deductions from remuneration being taken.



70. For debts over £1000, If the team were unable to contact the branch after four

   call attempts, the debt and recovery of it was escalated to the Network Contract

   Managers, to discuss the debt with the Branch and agree a repayment or

   payment plan by instalments. Only after liaison with branch by the Network

   Contract    Managers      and     confirmation    of   this   to   FSC     would

   deductions/repayment plans be set up. FSC then notified the branch in a third

   letter (as above) that the repayments / instalment payment plans had been set

   up.



71. If a branch just refused to pay any level of debt these were also referred to the

   Network Contracts Managers following the above process at para 70.



72. Once a deduction from remuneration was completed, the credits would be sent

   to the team via HR and were entered onto the customer account to clear the

   debt.



73. From the feedback from the postmasters, many of the debts on the customer

   accounts were seen by branches as a way of managing their cash flow and


                                   Page 28 of 46
                                                                                     WITNO6120100
                                                                                   WITN06120100




      paying the outstanding amount monthly. If a postmaster had someone

      managing the branch, they would have clear visibility of all TCs accepted and

      Settled Centrally along with any branch discrepancies. They were then able to

      pay off the debt and challenge their staff in Branch if needed.



   74. If postmaster did not have the cash to settle the debt created by a TC or Branch

      discrepancy, settle centrally would enable them to defer payment until the end

      of the month.



Disputed debts


   75. During the processes described above, if the postmaster called, or the team

      contacted the branch and the postmaster disputed the debt, the debt would be

      blocked within POLSAP, given a blocking code to denote dispute. This

      suspended The Dunning Process, and an investigation was passed to the TC

      issuing team. The debt would not be unblocked or chased until a response had

      been given to the branch. If it was a branch discrepancy, it would again be

      blocked and passed to NBSC tier 2 to support the branch in finding out how the

      discrepancy had occurred.




Former Agents Process


   76. "Former agents" refers to someone who has left, or for whatever reasons is no

      longer in charge of branch at the time of dealing with the debt. For instance, it

      could be that the postmaster had been suspended, was ill, had died, or had

      simply moved on.     Customer accounts were specific to a branch and the


                                     Page 29 of 46
                                                                                  WITNO6120100
                                                                                WITN06120100




   postmaster. A new account would be in place for every change of individual

   postmaster in the Branch.



77. In the scenario of a branch debt that had been settled centrally by branch, or

   posted by the audit team after a shortage/surplus was found, a process similar

   to that used for current agents would be followed. The postmaster would be

   sent two letters and a statement of the debt. and asked to contact the Former

   Agents Team to arrange repayment. If there was no response a third letter

   would be sent to advise the postmaster that civil recovery may be instigated.

   Recouping the debt from renumeration was not possible for former agents as

   they are simply not in post.



78.The hard copy file for the former agent would hold all details of the former

   postmaster, any tracing that was needed, or confirmed forwarding addresses

   and their tenure in branch.



79. Evidence in support of the debt would be collated into a bundle, with all the

   details of the case and any/all relevant evidence.       Each case would be

   assessed by the team manager, and a decision made on the viability of

   recovery. If viable to pursue, a bundle was prepared by the Former Agents

   Team.


80. That bundle was then sent to an external solicitor. Prior to when Royal Mail and

   Post Office Ltd business split, the case was sent to Royal Mail Internal Legal

   Team (I recall Mandy Talbot). It was for the legal team contact to make initial

   contact with the postmaster, requesting payment. After the split from Royal Mail

                                  Page 30 of 46

                                                                                   WITNO6120100




       further steps taken would depend upon the value of the debt and guidelines

       were set on actions to be taken with respect to the cost implications of civil

       recovery and internal Legal teams would also be engaged in the cases. I am

       unable to remember the agreed steps and values, but these were set out within

       a document in the FSC.




Relief from accounting losses / write off

   81. 1 have been asked to consider the availability of Relief from accounting losses

       / Write off process and referred to the following documents:

       a) "Losses and gains policy within the POCL agency network" (version 1, 20

          November 1998) (POL00088904) (in particular, section 5 and appendices J

          and L);

       b) "Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Accounting losses policy for agency

          branches" (version 1, February 2003) (POL00086845) (in particular, section

          4 and section 5);

       c) "Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Liability for losses policy (for agency

          branches)" (version 1.7, September 2003) (POL00088867) (in particular,

          section 4 and section 5);

       d) "Post Office Ltd Losses policy — overarching (branches)" (version 9,

          effective date April 2006) (POL00030562) and appendix 5 "Process for

          seeking relief on losses — singletons" (POL00030562);

       e) "Product and Branch Accounting — Write Off Process" (version 2.1, July

          2009) (POL00087409);

      f) "Policy document - Operators' in service debt" (version 1.0, 18 September

         2013) (POL00113670) (in particular, section 2— "Write offs"), as well as the

         policy's later iterations at POL00086868, POL00088579, POL00090357

          and POL00088312.

      I am unable to comment on items a — d as this was prior to my tenure in the

      Senior Debt Manager role.




   82. The terminology of `relief' being given was prior to my role and not used as far

      as I am aware by FSC. The FSC would receive requests for write off and this

      could be for example for a newly appointed Postmaster via the Network

      Contracts Managers for Postmaster that had only been in post for 6 weeks

      which could be class under the relief terminology.




Write off Requests

   83. Write off requests could be submitted to FSC by all areas of the business as

      documented in the write off policy (POL 00087409).



   84. Each write off would be documented with the reason for the write off request

      and authorised at the appropriate level. There could be many scenarios for write

      off requests. The following areas may request a write off for the following

      scenarios:

          a) Network Contract Managers/Head of Network, for settled centrally debt

             following an escalation,

                                                                                   WITN06120100




          b) Security/Financial Investigators, for debt not recovered after their

             investigation or criminal proceedings had ended;

          c) Network Audit teams, if there had been issues at the audit of a branch;

          d) FSC teams for:

               I.    Aged items that had not been issued as TC's to branches in a

                     timely manner;

               II.   Aged enquiries from clients

              Ill.   IC disputes that after investigation were accepted;

              IV.    Low value open items;

               V.    Current and Former agent cases for debt not recovered;

          e) Product or Client manager;

          f) Cash centres (these were posted directly by the cash services team to

             POLSAP);

          g) Directors.




Recovery (not by write off)

   85. 1 have been asked for my knowledge of options available and chosen by POL

      to proceed for the recovery of debts, so when a write off route has not been

      chosen or is not appropriate.



   86.FSCs role was to liaise with internal / external lawyer in the recovery of

      postmasters debt. Prior to the segregation of Post Office and Royal Mail I recall

      dealings with Mandy Talbot (from Royal Mail Internal legal team) and then Chris

      Darvill and Rodrick Williams in the Post Office Legal Team. External solicitors

                                                                                 WITNO6120100




   instructed were Beachcrofts, Bond Pearce/Womble Bond Dickinson. I cannot

   recall who matters were referred to for Scottish and Irish debt recovery cases.



87. Civil litigation options that were taken, dependant on the value of debt, were:

      •   Seeking a county court judgment for the debt to be determined;

          Attaching a charge on property to recover the debt once set;

      •   Applying for an attachment of earnings order (this was rarely done, so

          far as I am aware).



88. Civil recovery actions for recovery of postmaster branch debt would not have

   been progressed if there was an internal investigation — by Security /Financial

   Investigators - or if Criminal Proceedings were taking place.



89. The Current and Former Agent's teams in FSC were not the only teams that

   completed debt recovery activities.



90. The Security and Investigations Team also recovered debt via their

   investigations and criminal prosecution cases. Input would need to be sought

   from the Security and Investigations Team with respect to these cases and the

   recovery options available to them for Postmaster and Crown Employees.



91.The decision on whether to take such proceedings with respect to Criminal

   Proceeding fell to the Security and Investigation Team.

   92.1 did not have, nor did FSC, have a role in the decision making relating to

      whether Criminal proceedings were progressed.



   93.If, as a result of Criminal prosecution case, recoveries / repayments were made

      for debt on a postmasters Customer Account, the FSC would be responsible

      for recording ('posting') the credits to the postmaster customer account. If no

      debt was held by the FSC team, Security and Investigators, or their Finance

      Analyst, would post the recoveries within their business area and to a Security

      cost centre which fed to the profit and losses accounts.




Debts where underlying Horizon issues were involved

   94.1 have been referred to the emails at POL00073012, POL00057991,

      P0L00058295, P0L00073165, P0L00086835, P0L00061561, P0L00065615,

      POL00087648, POL00079022 and the note at POL00085749.



   95.1 shall address my knowledge of what approach was taken to instigate or

      continuing with debt recovery proceedings against SPMs / former SPMs

             a) who had raised issues about Horizon; and / or

             b) whose cases were going through the mediation scheme I being

             reviewed by Second Sight

      and what were the key considerations which informed decision-making in this

      respect.

96. 1 believe the first issues raised with respect to Horizon were via the Justice for

   Sub postmasters Alliance (JFSA) and then by Second Sight. A list of these

   cases was sent to FSC by the POL Legal Team. If hard copy files were held on

   these cases, they were copied and supplied to the legal team, the files copied

   had an orange cover to denote they had been sent to the Legal Team.



97. From the Email POL00073165 it appears that there were 23 cases with respect

   to JFSA_ For the cases that had a debt, I discussed these during a visit from

   Susan Crichton (General Counsel) and Aiwen Lyons (Company Secretary) and

   recommendation to proceed was initially made, but during the discussion with

   Susan she requested a risk /cost analysis be completed. This was produced by

   Emily Springford (Royal Mail Legal Services Team) (POL00085749). A paper

   was suggested to gain Susan's authority to proceed (POL00073165). I am

   unsure if Susan had then left the Business as Chris Darvill / Rodrick Williams

   were copied into these cases (POL00058295) along with Angela Van Den

   Bogerd and Alwen Lyons. (POL00057991).



98. The instruction to freeze recovery actions for JFSA and Second Sight cases

   was given by Rodrick Williams in May 2013 POL00061561.



99.POLs internal policy on managing any civil proceedings was suggested to

   Rodrick Williams by Andrew Parsons from Bond Dickinson in October 2013

   (POL00086835). With respect to Mediation cases and where Postmasters had

   made an application to the Mediation Scheme

          •   Pre-action recovery would be suspended;

                                                                                 WITNO6120100




          •   Live civil litigation will be stayed;

          •   Judgment /enforcement action would not be pursed (unless there

              was a credit risk and then POL may seek a charging order to secure

              its judgment).

   I was not however copied into this email. Rodrick stated that he would run it

   past me and gain a view on the approach and impact it may have on debt

   recovery but I unable to remember this or give any further details.




   100. Meetings were held with the internal legal team (Rodrick Williams),

   (POL00087648/POL00079022) the Mediation Scheme lead (Mark Underwood)

   and external solicitors to seek input with respect to the cases that were in the

   categories above at Para 102 and next steps that should be taken. Each case

   would be summarised as:

       a) Cases outstanding

       b) Time barred

       c) Resolved cases

       d) No debt held or previously written off

       e) Bankrupt/IVA

      f) Limitation deadline dates



101. Instructions with respect to next steps (i.e. keep the cases on hold or continue

with BAU recovery) were given by Rodrick William, Mark Underwood

POL00087648) and Angela Van Den Bogerd, as I would not necessarily have all

the details of the background discussions on these cases_ My role was to input into

the meetings with regards to the above a - f and instruct the FSC team to either

keep the cases on hold or proceed with BAU debt recovery.




102. If a postmaster that had debt on their customer account had raised issues

about Horizon, this should have been flagged to the Former Agents' team in FSC,

and the debt either blocked or confirmed by POL Legal that FSC should proceed

with BAU recovery actions (POL00087648). The information received in FSC with

respect to the challenges was from POL Legal Team and Mediation Team for:

      a) Mediation Cases.

      b) Cases referred to CCRC.

      c) Cases raised by Second Sights.

      d) Cases raised by JFSA (Justice for Sub postmasters Alliance)

      e) Cases raised via MPS

      f) Cases held by The Security and Investigation Team



103. Meetings were held (POL00087648) with the internal legal team, Rodrick

Williams, and the Mediation Scheme lead (Mark Underwood) along with external

solicitors to seek input with respect to the cases that were in the categories above

at Para 102 and next steps that should be taken. Each case was summarised as:

          a. Cases outstanding

          b. Time barred

          c. Resolved cases

          d. No debt held or previously written off

          e. Bankrupt/lVA

          f. Limitation deadline dates

104. Instructions with respect to next steps (i.e. keep the cases on hold or continue

with BAU recovery) were given by Rodrick William, Mark Underwood and Angela

Van Den Bogerd as I would not necessarily have all the details of the background

discussions on some of these cases. My role was to input into the meetings with

regards to the above a - f and instruct the FSC team to either keep the cases on

hold or proceed with BAU debt recovery.




105. If the FSC team were given information during the review of a case holding

Debt that could indicate Horizon issues these were flagged to Rodrick Williams.

POL00065615 was a Criminal Prosecution case where, after gaining an order

under the Proceeds of Crime Act, the Postmaster applied to set it aside and the

case was adjourned pending the outcome of referral to the Criminal Case Review

Commission. FSC would not have been progressing Civil recovery actions on this

case as it sat within the Security Team.




106. The approach advised by Rodrick Williams (POL00079022) for Current

Agents that claimed that Debt was due Horizon issues, in 2015, was that FSC

responded to the postmaster:


      •   That no evidence has been put forward to support allegations that

          Horizon caused branch Losses

      •   Ask the Agent to provide specific details of the allegation e.g.,

          transaction type, date and value plus any supporting documentation; but:

      • In the absence of anything material, the debt is payable.

Knowledge of bugs, errors and defects on the Horizon system

   107. I have been asked about matters relating to knowledge of bugs, errors and

   defects in the Horizon system.      I have been referred to the email chain at

   POL00095547, I am unable to recall this incident and questions with respect to this

   Email and it referring to a bug. I feel it would be better to direct any questions on

   this to Doug Brown and Michael Howarth.




   108. I have been referred to document POL00098016. I believe this is referring to

   the Receipts and Payments mismatch that I have briefly covered in para 49 above

   and any questions on this could be better directed to Rod Ismay (Head of FSC and

   Andrew Winn (Relationship Manager).




   109. After Horizon was introduced my understanding, at the time, was that there

   were very few bugs within the Horizon system. However, I and FSC would not have

   been involved and aware of all such issues as the issues could/would have been

   raised to the NBSC, raised to Auditors, raised to the Security and Investigations

   Team and the Network Contract Managers. I have no knowledge of the escalation

   process for these areas with respect to claims that there was Horizon bugs. FSC

   was simply not always engaged on these incidents. If any issues raised (as in para

   49 - 50) FSC would be engaged in the investigation to understand the issue, next

   steps and resolution.




   110. I have been referred to section 6 of the "Post Office Ltd — Security Policy

   Accounting losses policy for agency branches" (version 1, February 2003) at


                                     Page 40 of 46
                                                                                  WITNO6120100
                                                                                WITNO6120100




POL00086845) and the same section in the "Post Office Ltd —Security Policy:

Liability for losses policy (for agency branches)" (version 1.7, September 2003)

(POL00088867)_ I am unable to comment on these 2003 policies as I was not in

the Senior Debt Recovery role at this time. I have no recollection of these policies

or ever having to refer to them.




111. I have been referred to the email (POL00097787) which refers to Horizon

reversing a transaction that was raised by Second Sight and the postmaster.

Reading the email, it is suggested this was due to a connectivity issue, i.e. when

the Horizon kit lost connectivity and a transaction was not confirmed or failed_ As

far as I was aware, a recovery process was in place for branches with respect to

recovery after connectivity issues and the steps the Branch needed to take. Fujitsu

should have been able to confirm and evidence the connectivity issue. It appears

due to no budget being held by FSC, evidence via a report was not requested from

Fujitsu at the time of Andrew Winn's response to the postmaster. The budget for

such reports was held within the Security team. The email was sent to Gareth

Jenkins within Fujitsu for a response but there is no response within the bundle of

evidence I have been given. As far as I can see from the email I have been referred

to, the matter was addressed by my colleague Andrew Winn, writing to the

postmaster by letter of 14/12/2012 and a response to Second Sight is suggested

via the Legal Team (Rodrick Williams). I have no sight of either the letter to the

Postmaster or the response given to Second Sight. I am therefore unable to

comment further on this email and the scenario addressed.

   112. I have been asked if there is anything I wish to say, applying what my

   understanding now and what I did not know at the time. I would like to say that it

   was always my belief that Horizon was accurate and whilst there can be issues

   with any computer system, any changes made were always in a control and

   managed way with sign off from POL. I was extremely shocked and upset when I

   became aware during the Horizon Civil Litigation trial the Fujitsu representative,

   Richard Roll said that they (Fujitsu) were making changes to postmaster branch

   accounts without any discussion with POL. This puts my belief into the accuracy

   of Horizon totally into question, and makes me extremely sad when considering

   the potential impact of this.
