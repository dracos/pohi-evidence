Thank you for your help.

However, I have had an in depth conversation with Pete Thompson and we are now both uncomfortable with the
proposed response. Pete believes that the requirement stated under iii) and vii) has not been understood fully by us;
and that we have just covered off the counter part (the tip of the iceberg) and there is a host of detail we've
overlooked. HNG-X, PCI, Tivoli events, OCPs, MSCs, and more.

Pete has asked that this request be elevated to senior management for guidance on how we should respond; perhaps
a Fujitsu / POL strategy should be identified for these cases as making a mistake here could have profound
implications for both companies.

Kind regards
Penny

It would make sense if Gavin and I review and approve.

Guys,

I have been asked to review a response to POL from Penny Thomas that includes an estimated cost for work to
support a prosecution case. Would somebody from the account besides Finance and Commercial need to approve?

I'm ok with the presentation but will add some words around the price being indicative.
Just checking that it does not need anybody except Finance and Commercial as would expect some other account
review input.

Rob / Tim
Please find attached a slightly amended proposal and calculation sheet, which I would ask you both to review.

I'm on annual leave from close of play tomorrow (Thursday 15 September) and would really like to despatch this
return before I leave.

This estimate is for just under £70k and I really would like a commercial eye to review text and a financial eye to review
my calculations.

Because of the high value I have changed the process slightly for this request and have asked that POL raise a formal
Change Request in the event that the work is commissioned, which could be expedited with the estimates pre-
impacted.

I will call tomorrow to discuss.

Kind regards
Penny

I have received this request from POL, please see mail string.

Initially, it is my intention to provide POL with clarification of what we can provide, how long it will take to provide and an
estimate of cost.

I will request information from the relevant departments / disciplines and come back to you before I put in a price.

Kind regards
Penny

In addition to this information I omitted one other point. The solicitors have also asked for details of the hardware
records for each Post Office®. Similar to West Byfleet, I think they want to know the serial numbers of the equipment
installed and whether it was installed as new or reconditioned. If reconditioned where did it come from, was it
reconditioned or repaired because of a fault, if so what was the fault. Are you able to supply this information?

Hi Penny

I have been asked to assist Post Office® solicitors who are dealing with the above two cases whereby Horizon integrity
is being called into question. Both subpostmasters have been prosecuted but are refusing to repay the audit
shortages found during the investigation. The subpostmasters have both employed the same firm of Solicitors who
are alleging amongst a whole list of concerns raised, that the Horizon system suffers with inherent defects.

Post Office® Ltd has been asked to produce a large amount of information similar to the West Byfleet case. Some of
the information requested can be provided by Post Office® Ltd but some can only be provided by Fujitsu.
FUJ00225264

Could the following items be provided by Fujitsu for both Post Offices and if there is to be a cost to Post Office® Ltd for
this information could an approximate costing be provided before the data is obtained.

ASTWOOD BANK

i) Details of Horizon system testing with respect to the ability of the Horizon system to produce information
with sufficient clarity to allow a Subpostmaster to reconcile discrepancies.

ii) Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH) calls made from Astwood Bank Post Office® for the period 1st
November 2002 to 11th September 2008.

iii) Details of any firmware and software updates of Horizon between 2005 — 2009 and the reason for those
updates.

iv) The documents relating to the assessment of the pilot testing of Horizon Mark 2 and Horizon Mark 3, the

results of those assessments, the losses that were found within the system and details of how those
losses were reconciled or otherwise dealt with.

ALDERLY EDGE

v) Details of Horizon system testing with respect to the ability of the Horizon system to produce information
with sufficient clarity to allow a Subpostmaster to reconcile discrepancies.

2005 to 28th February 2009.
