1 Review of progress as of 25" February 2010

1.1 Introduction

This report has been prepared to describe the progress made by myself, the IT Expert
instructed by the Defence since first instructed in September 2009. This has been
offered as a simple table to provide clarity as to the development of hypotheses of
time, the work still required to conduct a proper investigation and the implications of

the witness statement of and interview with Gareth Jenkins in February 2010

Six weeks from the time that a date is
offered for access to a branch system for
the purpose of a user interface design audit

Gareth Jenkins, in a telephone
interview on 12th February 2010
confirmed the evidence in his
witness statement dated 2nd
February that use of the Fast
Cash button could result in
rejected card payment being
treated as over the counter cash.
Further, he said that there was a
possibility that when the touch
screen needed recalibrating a
user could believe they had
pressed one button while the
system recorded the pressing of a
different button (the call logs to
Fujistu identify that recalibration
was necessary on more than one
occasion).

I have now checked all cases of
Rejected Card payments and they
don't explain the discrepancies so
this hypothesis is irrelevant

it has not been possible to

Electronic Observation
of operational post
office where
discrepancies are
continuing to arise

A post office has been identified where
the sub post master is suffering from
continuing discrepancies, there is
currently no suggestion of theft or false
accounting and the sub postmaster is
prepared to permit electronic
observation of the use of the Horizon
system. The use of a camera or
screen capture tool was proposed in
the report dated 19th November 2009.
It has not been possible to conduct
electronic observation of the use of the
Horizon system at the identified post
office because the Post Office has not
released the sub postmaster from their
contractual obligation of confidentiality
and the Post Office has not facilitated
any arrangements to install the
necessary monitoring tool.

evidence of incorrect

it would be necessary
to review the technical

the potential source of
the incorrect

Ifthe potential source
of the incorrect

can be identified then it
would be helpful to be
able to reproduce the
problems under

consistent and
reproducible manner.
This would require the
assistance of Fujitsu in
providing access to the

maintained in support
of the Horizon system.

there are no longer any test
