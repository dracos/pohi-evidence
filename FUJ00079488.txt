PATHWAY CHANGE PROPOSAL CP NO.: 1040
CP TITLE: TPS/TIP Cash Account derivation DATE RAISED:
21/1/98
DATE BY WHICH CP TO BE IMPACTED: ORIGINATOR: Roy
Smethurst

RELEASE BY WHICH CP TO BE IMPLEMENTED: Release
2 URGENT

1. Description of Change Proposed:

The Cash Account message attribute grammar is changed to provide the cash
account line number and CAP as used by EPOSS in the Cash Account report. The
new attribute grammar is defined below.

2. Reason for Change:

The current version of Cash Account message implies that TPS Host must calculate
from the primary mappings which CA messages apply to which CA lines. This is a
duplication of the same calculation EPOSS makes when producing the Cash Account
report. It is not obvious that the TPS Host will get the same answer. Also there will be
less CA transactions to harvest as there will be at maximum one CA transaction
message per CA line

3. Consequences if Not Approved:

Code is duplicated, and TPS Host cannot guarantee accuracy of the Cash Account
records to be sent to TIP.
