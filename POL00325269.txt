Contractor may be liable under clause 8.1 above, POCL shall promptly notify

1) A new paragraph 3.6 shall be added to Schedule G1 to the Codified Agreement as

follows:

3.6 Data Errors

3.6.1.1 Subject to sub paragraph 3.6.3 below, if the Contractor discovers any error occurring
in transaction records or cash account stream records other than the errors described
in sub paragraph 3.6.1.2 below (“Data Errors”) prior to the relevant record being
transmitted by the Contractor to POCL over the TIP Interface, the Contractor shall
not transmit the relevant record but shall retain it and promptly issue to POCL a
manual error report complying with sub-paragraph 3.6.2 below (a “Manual Error
Report’).

3.6.1.2 The following errors shall not be Data Errors:-

3.6.1.2.1 errors which are caused by invalid data input by Users in Outlets and are
not detected by the process introduced by the Accounting Integrity Control

Release;

3.6.1.2.2 errors caused by Reference Data (correctly applied by Pathway) which
preclude transactions from being correctly taken into account in the

subsequent cash account;

3.6.1.2.3 Cash accounts which are incomplete by reason of erroneous Reference
Data provided by POCL.

3.6.2 Each Manual Error Report shall include a full specification of the relevant record
following correction of the Data Error (the “Repaired Data”), in a format suitable for

POCL to key into a POCL Data input facility.

Electronic Submission of Repaired Data

3.6.3 If in any cash account week the number of Data Errors exceeds 50 the provisions of
paragraph 3.6.1.1 above shall not apply in respect of Data Errors occurring in that

cash account week (except to the extent that Manual Error Reports shall already have
3.6.4

3.6.5

3.6.6

POL00325269
POL00325269

been submitted to POCL). In that event the Contractor shall, unless otherwise agreed
by POCL:

a) withhold the relevant record;

b) correct the relevant Data Error; and

c) submit the relevant record containing the Repaired Data for electronic

transmission over the Data Interface.

Where a Data Error shall not have been discovered prior to transmission of the
relevant transaction record but is subsequently discovered by the application of a
weekly checking process (such Data Error being hereafter referred to as a “Weekly
Data Error”) the provisions of paragraph 3.6.3 above shall not apply to such Weekly
Data Error. Instead such Weekly Data Error shall (subject to paragraph 3.6.6 below)
be dealt with by the issue of a Manual Error Report as specified in paragraph 3.6.1.1
above notwithstanding that the total number of Data Errors in the relevant week may

have exceeded 50.

If the number of Weekly Data Errors exceeds twenty in any week the Contractor
shall, in consultation with POCL, review the process introduced by the Accounting
Integrity Control Release with a view to enhancing such process in order to detect the
relevant Data Errors prior to transmission of the relevant data and to identify and

correct root causes of such Data Errors.

If the number of Weekly Data Errors exceeds fifty in any week POCL shall be entitled
to require the Repaired Data relating to such Weekly Data Errors to be dealt with in
accordance with sub paragraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 3.6.3 and not paragraph
3.6.4.

The Contractor undertakes that it will apply on a daily basis those checks required by
the TIP Control CCD to be so carried out and that all Data Errors discovered thereby
will then be dealt with in accordance with sub-paragraph 3.6.1.1 or 3.6.3 as

appropriate.

The Contractor undertakes that the delay between the occurrence of a Data Error (or

in the case of a Weekly Data Error, its detection) and the notification of the Repaired
POL00325269
POL00325269

Data to POCL (either by manual error report or electronically pursuant to paragraph

3.6.3 above) shall not exceed five working days.

3.6.9 Where the Contractor is required to make an assumption in order to correct a Data
Error and/or present Repaired Data, the Contractor shall make such assumption and

promptly inform POCL of the assumption made.

3.6.10 The Contractor shall pay to POCL 30 days after the end of each month a sum to
compensate POCL for its costs in dealing with Manual Error Reports equal to £150
per Data Error discovered after transmission of the relevant data and £100 per other

Data Error occurring in the cash account weeks ending during that month.

Other Discrepancies

3.6.11 The Contractor shall, following discovery of any discrepancy of the nature described
in paragraph 3.6.1.2.2 or 3.6.1.2.3 above, promptly issue a report to POCL containing
a brief description of the discrepancy and shall co-operate with POCL to investigate

and resolve such discrepancy.

2) This CCN 562 also modifies Acceptance Resolution Plan 376 (Reference
CR/ACD/376 Version 0.9 Dated 234 September 1999); paragraph 5.3.3. thereof shall
be amended as appropriate to be consistent with the provisions of Clause 1 of this
CCN 562 to the intent that the procedures and obligations set out in Clause 1 of this
CCN562 shall take precedence over, and replace, the procedures and obligations set

out in numbered paragraphs 1 to 5 (inclusive) of the said paragraph 5.3.3.

THIS SIDE AGREEMENT, being Change Control Note (CCN) No 561 is made the 24th day
of September, 1999

BETWEEN:

1)

POST OFFICE COUNTERS LTD. whose registered office is at Gavrelle House, 2-14
Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8HQ; and

2) ICL PATHWAY LIMITED whose registered office is at 26 Finsbury Square, London
EC2A 1SL (the “Contractor”)

WHEREAS:

a) The parties have today entered into a Second Supplemental Agreement (the “Second
Supplemental Agreement”) to the Codified Agreement (the “Codified Agreement”)
between the parties dated 28% July, 1999.

b) The parties entered into a Supplemental Agreement dated 20% August, 1999, to the
Codified Agreement (the “First Supplemental Agreement”).

c) This Side Agreement (the “Side Agreement”) constitutes CCN No 561 to the Codified
Agreement.

d) Through the execution of this Side Agreement the parties wish to agree to co-operate

with each other with a view to optimising their available Rollout resources and
minimising the occurrence of fluctuations in workloads.

It is Agreed as follows:

1

11

1.2

2.

INTERPRETATION
Words and expressions defined in the Second Supplemental Agreement, the First
Supplemental Agreement or the Codified Agreement shall bear the same meanings

when used in this Agreement.

In this Agreement the expression “POCL” shall bear the meaning ascribed thereto in
the Codified Agreement.

Unless the context otherwise requires references in this Agreement to clauses and
recitals are to clauses and recitals to this Agreement.

COOPERATION

Each of the Contractor and POCL agrees to co-operate with the other:

a) to optimise utilisation of the Contractor’s and POCL’s available Rollout
resources; and

b) to minimise the occurrence of fluctuation in POCL’s and the Contractor's
workloads during Rollout.
3.

POL00325269
POL00325269

PARTICULAR OBLIGATIONS

Without prejudice to the generality of the obligations contained in the above Clause 2:

4.

a)

b)

d)

POCL will implement a policy change with effect from 1st October 1999, so that
each subpostmaster will be given specific dates for training and implementation
and will only be allowed to refuse those specific dates in exceptional
circumstances. Following the implementation of such policy change the
Contractor shall produce a Rollout plan which is evenly balanced between days
of the week in which Rollout is scheduled to take place.

POCL will undertake in-office data migration of up to 315 Outlets per five day
working week (the “Number”). The Number shall be proportionately less in
weeks including public holidays. POCL will use its reasonable endeavours to
undertake in-office data migration in more than the Number of Outlets to the
extent necessary to accommodate variations from the Roll Out Programme due
to variations from anticipated dropout rates.

POCL and the Contractor shall work together to agree Rollout plans for each of
the four implementation programme areas (each being an “ Area”), so as to
minimise week-on-week variation in workload (after making appropriate
adjustments for public holidays and increases and decreases of work in each
Area so as to achieve in aggregate the weekly requirements of the Roll Out
Programme), to the extent that this is practicable given other constraints (which
without limitation shall include the geographical distribution of Outlets and any
other constraints) (for each Area, the “Area Implementation Programme”).

The Contractor and POCL shall agree procedures such that POCL is given by the
Contractor as much advance notice as is practicable of numbers of Outlets
dropping out of each Area Implementation Programme on completion of
training so as to enable POCL to undertake short-term re-balancing of resources
between Area Implementation Programmes.

DEVELOPMENT OF PROCESSES AND REVIEW

The Contractor and POCL shall work together to develop processes to support the
obligations detailed in Clauses 2 and 3 above, and will review these processes jointly by
‘1st November 1999.

5.

5.1

5.2

MISCELLANEOUS

The provisions of clause 603 of the Codified Agreement shall apply, mutatis mutandis,
to any notice to be given under this Agreement.

No delay or omission in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement

shall:

i)

it)

affect that right, power or remedy; or
operate as a waiver of it.
5.3

POL00325269
POL00325269

The single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy under this Agreement
shall not prelude any other or further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right,
power or remedy.

The rights, powers and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and are
not exclusive of any rights, powers and remedies provided by law.

The provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be incorporated as appropriate
amendments to the Codified Agreement.

Except to the extent expressly amended by this Agreement, the provisions of the
Codified Agreement and its schedules shall continue unamended and in full force and
effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF THIS Side Agreement has been executed on behalf of the parties as

Description of Incident (10)

Evidence from the Live Trial shows that the counter system is subject to "lockups" and "screen freezes", where the
system halts in mid-processing giving the user no opportunity to take any corrective action. This is either exhibited
Iby the system hanging or presenting a blank blue screen. The user is forced to ring the HSH and is advised to reboot
the system.The immediate effect of this problem is in terms of the reliability of the Service Infrastructure’s input
devices. However, once the underlying reasons for the problem are identified, this could change the perception.At
least 25 such occurrences have been identified on the LTSC log between the start of the Core Observation Period on
31st May and the 28th June. However, as such problems should be reported directly to the HSH, it is likely that this
Inumber represents only a small proportion of the total in which case, this problem would be widespread.
Consequently, POCL’s initial assessment is that this incident is likely to be more than low severity.

POCL to procure applications from a third party supplier.

At the time the POCL Infrastructure Acceptance Specification was being agreed it was recognised that the technical
documentation to support it did not exist. Therefore POCL agreed that Pathway could provide the documentation at
a later date. Furthermore it was understood that Pathway were allowed to put forward their proposal as to how this
criteria would be met in the future.

The main document cited was the ICL Pathway External Applications Procurement Policy’ which detailed an
approach as to how they would work with a third party supplier. However this document still does not meet the
criteria as they stand today.

Furthermore the other cited references, ‘Counter Hardware Design Specification’, 'OPS Architecture Document’ and
'TMS Architecture Document’ do not meet the criteria as being clearly defined technical documentation.

Providing third party documentation as with 'Riposte 32 API Specification’ indicates that the documentation is not
Imaintained by Pathway and therefore does not fully meet the criteria.

In summary the documentation provided is not sufficiently detailed to allow POCL to procure applications from a
{third party supplier.

Description of Incident (10)

New description: A number of individual operational incidents have been raised by TIP concerning (a) the delivery
of transactions files and cash accounts to TIP after Day D, (b) Transaction files and / or Client summary files not
being received at all on the expected dates and (c) files not being delivered by 03:00. The continued occurrence of
such incidents suggests that there is a system management fault that will cause a breach of the SLA for Data file
delivery, in particular that 100% of all transaction records are to be delivered by 03:00 on Day D. (Schedule G10
paragraph 3.1) A consistent failure to meet this would constitute a high severity fault and an occasional failure would
constitute a medium severity fault.

The gateway of accepted files has not been cleared down. This could cause a potential files overload and the gateway
would not be able to handle the volumes. Currently, the analysis if the gateway is unnecessarily cluttered, causing
delays in the production of statistical results. POCL do not know if this is a procedural problem or whether there is a
fault in the systems management of the gateway. A TIP incident number 784 was originally raised on 11 May 1999
and the original Acceptance Incident was raised with Pathway at the time but was withdrawn in order to amalgamate
the TIP incidents into aggregate ones. This particular one stands on its own and is being re-raised.

Severity: POCL - medium

PWY - admit it is a problem but question why SLA's are not being used for this. The second part to the AI is
old number AI 363. They were lumped together as the outcome of the Gateway not being cleared would result in
non delivery of files.

Rectification: Richard Brunskill to provide details of rectification plans.

Description of Incident (10)

The contractor shall carry out system management of all the Services in a consistent and coherent manner to ensure
the following:

b) changes to the Services can be made speedily and accurately.

Upgrade of 299 offices was planned to be done on 10th/1 1th July such that all offices were able to offer an LT2
service at start of business on Monday 12 July. Success criteria were identified (see Pathway Report dated 16/7/99
version 2). Release contents for LT2 were identified in Pathway Report CS/REP/043 version 1.0 dated 9/7/99).

Not all 299 offices were successfully upgraded to LT2 by 0900 hours Monday 12 July. by 1030 hours 288 had been
upgraded leaving 11 offices still operating LT1. The follwing incidents are demonstrations of the failure to meet the
criteria.

IA number of errors caused by corruptions to .dil files:
- outlets unable to declare stamps, stock and cash (Pathway problem reference PC0027742)
- receipts not equal to payment errors (FAD codes: 390329, 8523, 13523, 166328)

IApproximatley 35 outlets made calls to the HSH with the following problem
- appearance of a No Entry sign on the desktop preventing continuation (Pathway problem reference PC0027743)

IAn LT2 change was to the font size for the cash account. TP report that 8 offices (FAD 252329, 205329, 407329,
258523, 188504, 156523, 166328, 461329) produced cash accounts with the old font size.

Description of Incident (10)

New Description: AIS contravention/ Data integrity - derived cash account not equal to the electronic cash
account. Incidents (TIP 821, 822, 846, 855, 856, 857, 858, 859, 864, 965, 866, 868, 869, 870, 873, 874) have been
raised by TIP in respect of all transactions that constitute a cash account have not been received by TIP or when.
electronic cash accounts received where transactions that have been conducted and received by TIP are missing from
the respective cash account lines. These issues have come to light when comparing a TIP derived cash account with
the electronic cash account sent by Pathway. Not all instances of similar occurrences have been logged by TIP as the
physical resource to check each occurrence of a difference within the derived versus the electronic is not available.
It was expected that this facility would by now be comparing like with like. This is very significant. Missing
transactions and missing cash account line entries cause reconciliation failures within POCL back end systems and
error resolution is invoked. The cash account produced by the Organisational Unit in these instances must be in
doubt and is not a fair reflection of the business undertaken at each Organisational Unit. A subpostmaster may be
asked to bring to account an error, but the error was produced via system failure rather than human failure. Many
hours of investigation at both the front end and back end have taken place to help resolve these problems. The
benefits assigned to POCL back end system in respect of an automated cash account are being questioned.
Severity: POCL  - high - would effect POCL's ability to produce an accurate cash account.

PWY -accept the problem exists. Would argue about the severity - would it genuinly effect the accounting

integrity as it currently exists?

Rectification: Steve Warwick to provide rectification of this issue. PWY understand the problem and are currently
working on the fix. Steve Warwick to provide details.

Description of Incident (10)
Recovery facilities are inadequate for the recovery of transactions. They fail criterion 32, 549/2This area of

functionality is weak and requires the operator to declare the reversal as a lost transaction and then at a later point
reverse the recovered transaction. This procedure is difficult to operate and does not provide full audit trail for
reversed transactions. When declaring the transactions that have been missed the range is referred to as the "gap". It
has come to light that the NR2 system only supports one gap. Due to the business need to continue trading by
delaying the recovery , it is possible that additional failures will create further "gaps" . Since the system does not

support this there is a shortfall in process / procedures.

Description of Incident (10)

The physical security controls in force at the two main Pathway data centres at Bootle and Wigan are deficient ina
number of areas, when measured against best practice, relevant standards (BS7799, as required by 698.03 and PS41,
IDITSS as required by PS22) and Pathway’s own Security Management Procedures (RS/PRO/028 1.0 10.5.99),
which form part of Pathway’s Security Policy (RS/POL/002 4.0 30.4.99), which is in turn the response to
Requirement 698.02.

‘The data centres are a critical element of the Pathway service provided to POCL, and should be protected to an
adequate standard to control the risks and liabilities of both Pathway and POCL (as per 698.01 and PS39).

Recent inspections of the Data Centres show that the quoted criteria are not met. Detailed comments have been
passed to ICL Pathway on a number of occasions, including following the last site visit on the 22nd July. However,
these include:

Bootle

1. The Data Centre is located within 2m of a car park used by staff from a number of other organisations over which
ICL Pathway have no control, and to which visitors cars have largely unrestricted access. The DITSS recommends
a 25m vehicle exclusion zone. There are no physical restrictions on pedestrian access up to within 2m of the Data
Centre, with the outer site fence claimed purely to be a delimiter and not intended as a physical control. CCTV
coverage of the car park close to the Data Centre does not appear good, and POCL have been denied permission to
view the CCTV coverage. Pathway’s previous stated mitigations to the proximity of the car park, based on CCTV.
tracking, control of visitors cars, etc do not appear to be effective.

2. The fence protecting the Data Centre itself is in such a poor state as to offer only a low level of protection against
intrusion - at various points tensioning wires are missing, the fence is not secured to the ground, locks are missing or
‘in a poor state, the fence is just fixed to the uprights purely by twisted wire, etc. Although the inner moat is covered
by an IR alarm and CCTV, this is little mitigation against a quick denial of service attack; as above, POCL have
been denied permission to view the CCTV coverage.

Wigan

1. The overall site is largely "public", with few controls on pedestrian access, indeed the area near to back gate was
in use by youths, unnoticed by the site security presence, during a recent visit. Although some legacy CCTV is in
place, this is monitored by a single member of staff who also acts as receptionist, undertakes tours of inspection etc,
which given the lack of any movement detection or site alarm is unlikely to provide reliable detection of intruders.
[One CCTV camera has been "missing" since the time of our initial visits, and we understand that ICL Pathway have
declined to pay for a CCTV upgrade. The outer site fence is again a delimiter rather than a security barrier. Asa
result, there is in effect public access right up to most of the building, or to within 5m of the Data Centre (although
the inner nrotection to the Data Centre has naw heen hroneht 1m to a more accentable standard)

assets (including services")
BS7799 s5

Relevant referenced documents for Physical Security include:
- Pathway Security Management Procedures - s5 (eg 5.1.1 "security of the perimeter is consistent wit the value of the

 DITSS s13 (specific advice on vehicle parking distances etc).

Note also the new Data Protection Act imposes a duty on Information Security.

the inner protection to the Data Centre has now been brought up to a more acceptable standard).

Note that Pathway’s own Security Management Procedures [s5.1.1] refers to "defined perimeters. ... with consistent
level of security” and states that the security measures shall ensure that:
a) the security of the perimeter is consistent with the value of the assets (including services) under protection
Ib) the security perimeter is clearly defined.

Description of Incident (10)
Pathway produce a Service Review Book reporting performance against service levels on a monthly basis. In the July
1999 Service Review Book, Pathway reported that during the previous month they had passed all the service levels
relating to transaction services for AP, EPOSS and OBCS (these all relate to transaction times).

On the 22nd July 1999 Adele Kilcoyne requested an ad-hoc report from Pathway to be provided by 3 August. Pathway
acknowledged receipt of the request on 29 July.

The purpose of this request was:
- to confirm the overall level of service for the purposes of live trial evaluation (the review book does
not report actual levels of service if the SLA is met)

to verify that Pathway are calculating these SLAs in accordance with the contract schedules.

Pathway are contracted to provide this information within three working days of the request (Schedule CA15v10r
Requirement 914).

When this information had not been received on the 13 August Adele left a message on Richard Brunskill’s mobile
phone, no reply was received. As information had still not been received on 27 August, Adele made a further request.
‘In response to this request Adele received a phone call from Nicole Meredith of Pathway on the 27 August who
reported that they were now looking into this and would produce the information as soon as possible, and that the
person who is dealing would be back the following week.

The reason given for the delay was that the information was not available until now.

[As of today, 1 September, this information has still not been supplied.

‘The reason given for the delay is a major cause of concern for the following reasons:

- if the data was not available it would not have been possible to report that they had passed the service levels - this
calls into question the veracity of their service reporting.

- the computation of these service levels requires transaction counting (for the purposes of weighting fall-back
transactions and the calculation of remedies). Without this information we do not have assurance on how transactions
are being counted in the live environment for Service Levels. We know from a meeting between Liz Blackburn and
(Graham Wingrove and Dave Fletcher of Pathway (9 July 1999) that the system cannot currently count as defined for
steady state charging purposes as defined in Schedule A12.

- Pathway have not provided assurance that data will be available to timescales in the future. Adele Kilcoyne raised
Pathway’s refusal to provide three such previous requests at the 21 July Service Review Forum. She asked for
clarification of the agreement to provide information in this manner and also asked why no reason had been given for
not be able to supply this data. Richard Brunskill stated that from this point forward all ad hoc requests would be sent
via him and that a documented procedures was to be agreed (these comments are as minuted). Clearly Pathway’s

Analysis of Acceptance Incident (6)
Four calls have been formally added to this incident, and are addressed below.

In addition we have been informed of a further 7 incidents in week 22, detailed analysis of which has been sent
separately to Calum Craig and to TIP. In summary 6 of these resulted from a fault introduced by an attempted fix in
another area, which resulted in the system not preventing the user from swiping a book while at an inappropriate menu.
This bad fix has already been reversed out and a good fix made.

‘The 7th incident was caused by the reversal of Parcel Traffic and Non-Accounting Data transactions within a single
Existing Reversals session. This should not be done, and EPOSS needs amendment to prevent transactions with
different original transaction modes being reversed in the same session. This is being fixed under PinICL 29148. A
fix is in test and is expected on the counters no later than 22nd September.

IWe have also been informed of 5 incidents in week 23. These were caused by transactions in incorrect modes, as for
the 6 above.

[RED 99081810546, HSH 9908160116, PinICL 28627 was caused by a user navigating to the reversals screen while
having a remittance on the stack and then settling it, causing the transaction to be settled with the incorrect mode.
Solution is to disable the reversals button. Fix in test and is expected on the counters no later than 17th September.

RED 99081810547, HSH 9908160118, PinICL 28628/28547 was caused by an error which allowed the stock unit roll
process to be executed twice. This is in fact another aspect of TIP Incident 910, part of AI376. The multiple instances
of stock unit roll not only caused the inability to harvest cash account records but also put the counter into the wrong
ICAP and added the bought forward value for the start of CAP21 into the line 1085 value in the CAP 20 cash account.
The fix was delivered to outlets starting on 14th September.

HSH 9908240194/5 are similar: During APS recovery a situation occurred in which an APS transaction was recorded
against the Default stock unit, causing the cash account to be out of balance. Fix will shortly be passed to OTT, and is
expected in live by 24th September.

1 Purpose

This document sets out ICL Pathway’s proposals that Acceptance Incident 218,
currently a medium severity incident, has an agreed resolution plan and that its
achievement will allow Acceptance Incident 218 to be Closed.

2 Summary

The Acceptance Incident was raised stating that "the majority of offices were
experiencing considerable ongoing difficulty in performing the completion of office
cash accounts.

Since then, there have been a number of developments in different areas to support the
closure plan for AI218. These areas are detailed below and all activities are included
in the overall resolution plan and activities are on schedule. A set of success criteria
have been drawn up and were passed to ICL Pathway on 26 August 1999.

The closure report reflects the application of the appropriate set of success criteria and
cross refers to the relevant measurement, analysis and 'agreement to close' activities to
be included in version 0.3 of the Rectification Plan.

3 Detailed activities

These have been in the areas described below. Where applicable the dates associated
with these activities are contained within the Timetable, Part B of Schedule 2 of the
second Supplementary Agreement (“the timetable” ).

Application software: changes have been made, principally in the area of stock unit
balancing and cash account to both software and surrounding processes to make the
task of office balancing easier to understand and complete. These changes were
implemented for LT2 and have proved successful in live use.

Training: changes have been made to the managers’ training event to spend more
time on the areas of error handling, printer use and principally stock unit balancing
and cash account. Again, these changes have proven successful in live events.

Help Desk: The Horizon Systems Helpdesk (HSH) has now been strengthened by the
addition of a cash account domain on Wednesdays and Thursdays. This is to ensure a
more advanced level of support for offices that are encountering cash account
problems.

Further to the activities above, a workshop took place on 13th August which
identified seven specific areas for potential improvement in association with AI218.
Commercial consequences of the actions below are agreed in an exchange of letters
between Bruce McNiven of POCL and Liam Foley of ICL Pathway(ref B.McNiven
letter of 3rd Sept. and Liam Foley's letter of 8th Sept.).

These areas are as follows:

Version: 0.5
Acceptance Incident 218 Date: 23/9/99

e Pre-Entry Event

ICL Pathway has offered to develop and run 370 half day events for a maximum of
4,400 office managers. This is a new event and the dates for the development of this
event are covered in detail within the timetable. Specification of the event is defined
in doc. IM/PRO/172, version 0.2 - Specification of pre-entry event. This specification
has been agreed with POCL through joint working groups.

© Post Installation Care

References were made in the success criteria for AI218 to the importance of an agreed
resolution plan for AI408. It has been jointly agreed that the Resolution Plan for
AI408 is sufficient to cover any residual concerns about post installation care and
consequent references to training.

e Post Installation Competency Strategy

The joint workshop on 13 August accepted that not all users within the large
population will ‘absorb’ Horizon. This may eventually call for closure of the outlet,
replacement of the sub-postmaster or training of additional staff. It has been agreed
between POCL and ICL Pathway that other steps taken within this resolution plan
should minimise the risk of this and that any residual fallout will be handled by
POCL. POCL have agreed to review and strengthen the relevant process. This is
reflected in the timetable.

e Monitoring Of Training Delivery

ICL Pathway has produced a document IM/PRD/066, version 0.2 - Monitoring of
Trainer Quality to detail the processes and procedures that are adopted by
Knowledgepool to ensure a high quality of training delivery. This document has been
reviewed by POCL and comments made which have been reflected in the latest issue
of the document.

e User Competency

POCL asserted that the Performance Standard Assessment (PSA) was proving too
subjective with potentially too much trainer assistance thus allowing trainees to pass
the PSA who would subsequently prove to be unable to handle Horizon in the live
environment. ICL Pathway and POCL have worked closely together to review the
PSA and to arrive at an agreed test to administer on the training courses. The actions
to achieve this are reflected in the timetable.

e Post Training Consolidation

It is recognised by POCL and ICL Pathway that insufficient use is being made of
training mode in the live environment. The parties have worked together to formulate
ideas for promotion of training mode in the live offices. Work on this subject is on-
going and the activities are reflected in the timetable.

e Agreed Training Course Changes

The changes raised by Trevor Rollason of POCL as a result of dry runs of the training
courses have been implemented and all courses are now signed off.

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

The Following table defines the critical success factors (CSFs) which should be
applied to each of the activities to enable the resolution of Acceptance Incident 218. In
essence the CSFs are consistent with those defined for the evaluation of the LT2

Horizon system release.

Reduction in demand on support -
Measured through a reduction in the
number of calls (at the peak time on
Wednesday evening and Thursday

It is assumed that the time taken for
balancing excludes any instances
where business related discrepancies
occur, e.g lost vouchers etc.

Ina typical sub-post office the overall
process for producing stock unit
balances, an office balance and the cash
account should be completed within
2.5 hours. In an ECCO office the
process should be completed within

4 Shours.

At least 95% success rate.

All support material must mirror the
system e.g. training materials, guides,
operating manuals and Training
Mode.

There should be no inconsistencies (as
reported to the NBSC).

[Mitigation - Where inconsistencies are
identified there should be an agreed

Acceptance Incident 298 — Resolution Ref: CR/ACD/298

Pathway Plan Version: 0.8

Date: 23/9/99

Purpose

This paper seeks agreed ways forward to resolve the system instability issues.

Summary

Pathway presents for review the relevant statistics for the period since 29 July, with
particular reference to System Load Events; the progress to date at a detailed level;
and the approach to future measurement, which it is proposed will involve POCL.

Criteria

The Criterion cited is 536/1.

“peripheral and input devices supplied as part of the elements of the Service
Infrastructure on which OPS is provided shall be reliable, robust and easy to use”.

POCL position

Based upon the minutes of the Acceptance Board Meeting of 18 August 1999, POCL
contended that:

“the proposed rectification plan does not provide an understanding of how the
problems will be resolved by the proposed fixes. It is also unclear when fixes will be
implemented” .

“POCL would need to see the outturn of [the fixes] as this was the only way to
confirm the impact of the changes” .

“evidence from ringarounds suggested the problem could be 50% higher than
reported at the help desk and that there was no clear evidence from Pathway to
confirm or deny this”.

At the Acceptance Workshop on 6" September POCL introduced a proposed metric
of 1 system “lock-up” or “crash” (requiring reboot) per counter PC per annum. This
is based upon the achievement of a 95% reduction in stability incidents reported
against week 19 and is said to be broadly in line with system stability statistics from
ECCO and ALPS.

5 Pathway position

5.1 Pathway work programme

5.1.1 Short- Medium Term Activities

The ICL Pathway programme of work to stabilise the current level of system
comprises root cause analysis and resolution of system incidents:

e detailed examination of Horizon System Help Desk call records

e direct telephone contact with post offices to more fully understand the detailed
nature of the problem as seen by the users

e reconstruction and analysis of problems within Pathway test systems

¢ testing and automated distribution of fixes as described in the Acceptance Incident
Analysis of 17 August

The details of this work programme are provided in Section 5.3, which gives an
analysis of the various system stability faults by category, along with details of fixes
applied and associated incidents levels pre- and post-fix.

5.1.2 Medium-Long Term Activities

In parallel with this short term activity, a thorough review of the detected faults is
underway to ascertain their nature and to identify what changes may be appropriate to
the ongoing Pathway development and testing approach. Section 5.5 of this document
provides details of the analysis already undertaken in this respect, the initial
conclusions and suggestions for improved defect removal for future releases.

5.2 Statistics for the period since 29 July

5.2.1 High level analysis

The principal measure of systems instability has been the calls made to the Horizon
Systems Help Desk by outlet staff reporting a problem with the functioning of the
system at the outlet.

For a proportion of such calls the incident is resolved by a system unit reboot (a Help
Desk “authorised reboot”). In other cases the Help Desk staff may recommend an
avoidance action that provides a simple workaround to the problem without rebooting
the system unit. In certain cases the Help Desk may also receive a call from an outlet
advising that outlet staff have locally initiated a reboot; such calls are recorded by the
Help Desk and normally provide some additional information relating to the
circumstances of the incident.

Pathway Plan Date: 23/9/99

5.2.2 System Load Events & “Unauthorised” Reboots

POCL expressed concern over the potential occurrence at outlets of locally initiated
system unit reboots that had not been reported to the Help Desk. ICL Pathway
subsequently mounted an exercise to extract this information by extracting and
analysing the Windows NT System Event Logs at each outlet. This provides precise
statistics for all System Load Events (SLEs) whatever their cause. By correlating
these load events with reboot instructions issued at the Help Desk it has been possible
to produces metrics for both authorised (via HSH) reboots and unauthorised (via local
office action) reboots. This analysis is continuing on a day by day basis.

Such unauthorised reboots may occur for a variety of reasons, including:

1. in response to a perceived systems malfunction of some kind, where the clerk
does not contact the Help Desk and initiates such action of his own volition

Rv

in response to an environmental incident such as a power cut or through
disconnection of the power supply

we

through failure to leave the machines switched on during periods of
unattended operation (e.g. overnight or weekends) with corresponding reboots
when operation restarts, e.g. on a Monday morning

Since the circumstances relating to such incidents are unknown, the incidents cannot
be directly attributed as systems stability incidents and must be excluded from the
detailed analysis in the following section. Both POCL and ICL Pathway are working
to reduce the incidence of such reboots to the core unavoidable events (category 2)
through improved user education and discipline.

5.2.3 System Incident Metrics
The high level analysis of system instability incidents thus includes three categories:
e Authorised reboots (correlated with Help Desk instructions)
e Unauthorised reboots

e Total Help Desk system incidents (including authorised reboots and other calls
closed via avoidance actions)

Summary totals for the Cash Account Periods 19-26 are shown in the following charts

(Note that the total for CAP 26 is provisional and the final figure may be subject to
minor variation once all incidents from the 22" September have been fully analysed.)

Note that (i) CAP23 included a Bank Holiday and a planned (authorised) reboot of all
counters, by request to outlets; (ii) “ unauthorised” reboots have increased in CAP24
and CAP 25 due to the installation of new outlets showing up in the total. (This trend
is expected to continue.)

A more detailed scheme of incident analysis was instigated by Pathway from CAP23,
to facilitate focused incident analysis and resolution. This places emphasis on that
class of incidents which requires a system reboot. From week 24 an individual
reconciliation of incidents totals between Pathway and POCL has been occurring with
inclusion of a category for “ disputed” items which involve an HSH call but not a
reboot. For week 23 a retrospective adjustment has been added to the weekly total to
support comparison between the two weeks. However, direct comparison with earlier
weeks is not valid since the totals were not reconciled in this way.

The following chart shows the same data, with the planned reboot data removed
(31/8/99), CAP 23 adjusted for the bank holiday in terms of incident rate per day, and
the numbers for each week adjusted for the volume of counters installed. This shows
the incidence of the same measurements expressed as a rate of occurrence per counter
per week.

Pathway Plan Date: 23/9/99

From the above analysis it can be seen that there is a reducing trend, particularly
towards the end of the current period. The chart following shows the incidence of
HSH calls per counter per week relating to systems incidents. The level of HSH
(authorised) reboots is now at the level of approximately 0.5 per month per counter,
below the first Pathway target (1.0) and the proposed threshold for classification as
medium severity.

The increase in incidents in CAP 23 is attributable to the introduction of the “System
Busy” indicator and a one-off fault introduced into OBCS which both resulted in a
significant number of new calls.

The following chart shows the HSH system incident calls separated into those
requiring a system reboot and those dealt with by advice or other action.

HSH Authorised Reboots jg HSH Advice or Other Action

A number of analysed HSH calls have not been resolved between ICL Pathway and
POCL and are listed as disputed incidents. Such calls include simple workarounds to
known (predictable and stable) operational problems, and a few other incident types,
such as handling of printer jams and related printing conditions, which have not been
accepted by ICL Pathway as indicative of a system stability problem. The following
chart includes the above totals with disputed items shown as a separate category.

The principal incident in the disputed category is that of button locking (see section
5.3.1). Section 5.4.4 makes it clear that for the period of monitoring, those button
locking incidents that result in reboots or authorised workarounds will be counted.
HSH calls other than those, which result in reboots or workarounds due to button
locking, will not be monitored after CAP26.

5.2.4 Summary Position (CAP 25) & Future Projections

The incident types have been grouped into 13 categories and a detailed analysis is
provided in section 5.3.

Problems Eliminated

The following incident types have been eliminated with no noted recurrences:

e Back office printer hanging on final cash account production (Section 5.3.4)
e The “one-off’ OBCS problem (Section 5.3.12)

¢ Querying logged-on users problem (Section 5.3.8)

e Improvements in performance of the suspense account print (Section 5.3.2)

Problems Significantly Improved

The following incident types have seen significant improvement but have not been
totally eliminated

e Button locking problems (Section 5.3.1) have been reduced to a small number of
incidents, which can be avoided by workaround.

e Virtual memory and other error messages (Section 5.2.3)

e APS application problems - associated with printing and recovery (Section 5.3.11)

Key Outstanding Problems

The following problem areas have seen only minor improvements and are the
principal subjects of current analysis and fixes:

e Freezes during / after log-on and occasionally in other circumstances (Sections
5.3.5, 5.3.6 & 5.3.9)

e Counter printing issues (Sections 5.3.10 & 5.3.13)

e System Busy incidents (Section 5.3.7), although these are being re-categorised
into the underlying problems

The history of the main types of incident is shown in the chart below, shown on the
same scale as individual incident rates in section 5.3 (incidents occurring per counter
per annum). This indicates the history of when significant systems problems have
been experienced and eliminated.

This chart shows that the three significant incident categories as of CAPS 24-26 are
counter printing, system freeze conditions and system busy. (It is also apparent that
various AP problems in CAPs 19-23 were related to counter printer incidents, giving
rise to an understatement of such printer conditions during these weeks.)

Future Incident Rates

These are based upon an assessment of the current known problem areas with fixes
either in preparation or distribution, plus an expectation of smaller “ second phase”
improvements in the longer term to tackle residual incident types in significant
categories.

The main short term fixes assessed include:

1. The “Double F1” fix to relieve system freezes during log-on (week 25) plus
diagnostic to provide more details of other freeze conditions (should reduce 40-
50% of freeze conditions)

4. Alleviation of button locking problems when an EPOSS receipt is printed after an
APS receipt (should avoid workarounds for a substantial subset of incidents) —
issued in CAP 25

5. A revised version of System Busy based upon Riposte Desktop processor time
rather than total system time (this should eliminate some instances where system
busy is active because of background tasks rather than mainstream counter
operations) — issued in CAP 25

The future projections are separated into near term values for CAP 26 and 27, based
upon extrapolation of the HSH authorised reboot levels, and a set of medium term
values based upon system incident rates. All projections were made during CAP 25
based upon the actual field data obtained up to and including CAP 24. The
(provisional) actual figures for CAP 25 are also shown.

The projected incident rate remains essentially stable over the near term with
reductions matched by increased counter volume; during October and November there
is a steady increase as the rate of counter build up exceeds incident reduction rate.

5.3 Detailed Incident Analysis, Categorisation & Resolution

To facilitate analysis and resolution, system incidents have been filtered into
individual categories, each typically associated with one particular problem area of
system operation. To provide confidence in the improving stability of the system,
incidents are recorded as daily totals within each category, to allow correlation against
the dates at which particular fixes were issued to resolve specific problems. This
analysis includes all system stability incidents whether resolved by a system reboot or
by procedural workaround.

As detailed investigation of incidents proceeds, certain faults may be grouped together
into a new category. Initially 12 categories were identified. At week CAP24 a number
of system busy incidents (category 7) have been categorised differently as the detail of
the fault has been understood. Certain incidents previously recorded under “ system
busy” have been identified as hang during/after log-on (category 5) and a specific
problem associated with the counter printer during busy conditions has been created
(category 13).

From version 0.5 of this document, the incident count has been based against the

number of counters installed and quoted as average incidents per counter per annum.

5.3.1 Button No Entry Signs

From time to time under normal system operation Horizon buttons are “locked” to
prevent user entry to the particular function at that point in the menu navigation. Such

POL00325269

ICL Acceptance Incident 298 — Resolution Ref: CR/ACD/298

Version: 0.8
Pathway Plan Date: 23/9/99

locked buttons are represented to the user by a “no entry” sign across the button.
Examples of legitimate usage of locked functions include:

e prevention of more than one user selecting cash account functions or producing
certain types of daily printed report

e prevention of logout or entry to training mode when a suspended session exists

At LT2 substantial changes were made to button locking particularly to prevent access
to conflicting functions during cash account and printing functions. The logic
associated with button locking is complex and typically requires combinatorial
analysis of multiple conditions.

Fixes were issued to correct the majority of incidents recorded within this category, by
correcting the complex logic associated with button locking. A minor residual usage
problem has been identified, which results in button locking if the printer goes offline
immediately following a SU balance report. This problem has a simple workaround
and does not require a reboot.

The history of button locking incidents is shown below.

Note that reported incidents tend to be higher on cash account days because of a
higher incidence of legitimate button locking associated with cash account and office
printing functions. A number of disputed items (incidents which do not require
reboot) are excluded from week 23/24. With these included the average incident rate
is running at approximately 1 — 1.5 per counter p.a.

5.3.2 Suspense Account Print

The suspense account was taking an excessive time to print under certain
circumstances, giving the appearance of a system hang. A fix to improve the
performance was issued in two parts. The history of such incidents is provided below.

5.3.3 Virtual Memory Problems

Two problems have been observed which result in progressive memory leakage. (In
these circumstances application routines are obtaining virtual memory from Windows
but not freeing it correctly after use, leading to eventual virtual memory exhaustion.)
The reported symptoms include very slow system operation, virtual memory messages
being displayed and, occasionally a Windows shutdown and reboot. The principal
problem was memory leakage associated with the Print Monitor routine, which
resulted in a substantial loss of virtual memory during print operations. This was fixed
in WP 5408. A further residual, but relatively minor, problem associated with the cash
account reprint function has been diagnosed. A fix (lower priority) will be issued for
this in the future.

Several problems were detected which result in back office printer hang-ups under
various specific circumstances. A fix for one class of problem, associated with
memory leakage, has already been distributed as part of WP 5408. This has reduced
the average incidence of such hang-ups. A second problem associated with printing

5.3.5 Freezing during /after log-on

A number of incidents were observed in which the system froze after user log-on to
Riposte. On detailed investigation these were all connected with the Riposte (35 day)
message archiving procedure. After log-on various Riposte checks are called to trace
message sequences for integrity and (potential) recovery requirements. It was found
that certain of these routines were attempting to check message sequences which lay
beyond the message archiving window, resulting in system lock-up when the
messages could not be accessed. Three fixes were issued covering APS recovery
routines and Stock Unit checking.

problem (immediately following section) is also related and has had a significant
effect on incidents during week 25.

5.3.6 F1 Twice during log-on

This was a specific condition associated with incorrect handling of double keystroke
“PI” during log-on (to navigate directly to “ Serve Customer” ) which could result in
a system hang. A fix was issued for this (WP5406), which left a residual problem with
certain OBCS book operations. A re-implemented fix was issued to cure this - see
Section 5.3.12. A second fix to eliminate a small residual occurrence of the

“FI” condition is under test at the time of writing and will be issued to the live estate
during week commencing 13" September.

5.3.7 System Busy Message

This was introduced following discussion (via CR & Pathway CP2134) to provide
visible indication to the user when the system is busy, particularly during longer,
complex operations such as processing the cash account. This was distributed in WP
5407. The introduction of this message has itself resulted in a number of Help Desk
calls, which have also been tracked and analysed. An improved version of the busy
monitor routine was distributed (week commencing 6" September); this monitors only
resource usage associated with the Riposte desktop and invoked applications. (The
original utility monitored the total processor usage and could display the hourglass
when background routines such as NT or Tivoli functions were consuming resource.)

A minor problem has been detected with the operation of the Busy Monitor, in that
after a few seconds it can partially obliterate a system message displayed on the
screen if there is a printer problem when printing a Giro transaction. (This can occur
when EPOSS is cycling awaiting the user response before continuing.) The touch
panel is not disabled under these circumstances and the Help Desk will advise users to
complete the response to the printer prompt, thereby allowing normal operation to
continue without reboot. A “fix” to provide reworking of the Giro printer dialogue
will be issued in due course. From CAP 24 specific problems associated with printer
busy and log-on freezes have been separated into their own categories.

Note that it the clerk may legitimately return from a screen to a previous, having set
off a print or transaction log query, and then undertake a second or third intensive
transaction. A number of occurrences of the system busy condition are believed to
result from such clerk initiated sequences. A block on the “previous” button is being
investigated to preclude such behaviour.

5.3.8 Query Logged-on Users Message

This was a specific problem that occurred during various operations when a user
incorrectly received a message querying details of logged-on users. This was fixed in
WP 5406, which has eliminated the problem.

There have been a few occurrences of miscellaneous screen freezing during usage,
mostly within Stock Unit declaration and balancing operations. A few reported
occurrences were associated with virtual memory problems and are resolved with the
fix identified in section 5.3.3. Several occurrences resulted from attempts to access
message sequences beyond the 35-day archiving period and other occurrences are
associated with multiple button pressing.

A number of APS application problems associated with receipt issue were identified
(including the second receipt problem identified above).

In certain circumstances a failure in the APS receipting routines could leave buttons
locked and a transaction on the stack. This was also fixed as part of WP 5406. A
further fix was issued as part of the system freezing work (WP 5208) to specifically
identify to the user the presence of APS recovery operations since this could give the
appearance of a system freeze.

5.4 Resolution of Incident Metrics
Pathway notes the POCL proposed metric of 1 system “lock-up” or “crash”

(requiring reboot) per counter PC per annum.

The Pathway position is that this is an unrealistic and unwarranted requirement to be
placed on the Pathway Solution.

ICL Pathway Acceptance Incident 298 — Resolution Ref: CR/ACD/298
Plan Version: 0.8
Date: 23/9/99

5.4.1. Contractual Requirements

There is no contracted Service Level which Pathway is required to meet relating to
lost time associated with OPS system stability incidents. (Lost time at the counter may
contribute to an increase in the volume of fall-back transactions which may fall within
the service reporting requirements of individual services - EPOSS, APS and OBCS.)

5.4.2. Comparison against Industry Norms

The POCL proposed level is unrealistically high when compared against normal
operational usage of complex distributed systems based upon Windows NT. Typical
industry norms of I event per month are reported. It is noted by both parties that a
periodic planned “preventative” reboot, outside prime usage time, may be a sensible
measure to help reduce the incidence of unplanned reboots.

5.4.3. Acceptance Position

AI 298 was raised against Requirement 536, on the basis of Live Trial usage
experience.

The planned acceptance testing associated with this Requirement was fully completed
with no outstanding issues. This comprised a combination of detailed technical test
and a review of the technical specifications of the relevant equipment.

ICL Pathway has accepted that there have been some incidents at outlets, which have
affected certain aspects of system operation. As detailed within Sections 5.2 and 5.3
there has already been a significant reduction in such incidents from the earlier levels
in June and July when this AI was raised. Pathway set an internal target of one
(authorised) reboot per month per counter and proposes that achievement of this level
reduces the incident to a medium severity. The levels of lost time associated with the
current incident rate fall well within this yardstick.

5.4.4. Resolution Proposal

POCL has indicated a desire to associate this incident with a further metric which
would represent an “acceptable” level of operation with respect to the occurrence of
system incidents prior to the full outlet rollout.

ICL Pathway will use all reasonable endeavours to reduce the incidence of
interruptions to normal counter operations resulting from the use of the OPS platform
and the Riposte desktop functions. Pathway has set a longer term (6 months) internal
target of 1 Help Desk authorised reboot incident per counter per 4 months measured
over the actual population of rolled out counters. Workarounds taking longer than

four minutes will counts as reboots. This represents a fourfold improvement beyond
the initial target.

Monitoring during Oct/Nov

The success criteria in relation to this AI to be evaluated in November in relation to
the continuation of national roll-out in January 2000 should have the following
characteristics:

e The number of outlets installed within the live estate at 1 October, providing this
number is at least 750, or if less than 750, the number at the end of the week
during which 750 outlets is achieved.

e Incidents to be quantified in “units” where:

e Help Desk authorised re-boots and Office Snapshot Print Previews to count as
one unit;

e Other workarounds to remove invalid no-entry signs to count as half a unit;

e New workarounds to remove the need for re-boots (such workarounds to take
less than 10% of the combined reboot and recovery time) to count as a half
unit (those exceeding 10% to count as one unit).

e The rate of occurrence measured over the 4-week period to mid-November 1999
(CAP 31-34) should average no more than one unit per counter position per 3
months.

In addition, ICL Pathway will be entitled to continue the good business practice of
planned reboots outside working hours not to exceed one per month per counter
position.

Ongoing improvement and longer term

It is important to recognise that ICL Pathway is strongly motivated to reduce such
incidents as they directly affect its own costs through staffing levels required at the
Help Desk. The Pathway Help Desk model and projected staffing levels are consistent
with this approach. For ICL Pathway this equates to a requirement to deal with up to
700 such calls per week as the outlet population increases over the next six months
(and the incident rate falls). Clearly Pathway will be strongly motivated to seek any
further possible reductions in incidents to reduce the corresponding call rate applied to
a full estate.

For POCL the achievement of the ongoing target of 1 reboot per 4 months would
result in a predicted loss of service of the order of 6.25 minutes per counter per month.
For a typical outlet operational period of 42 hours per week this equates to a loss of
service of < 0.06% per counter. In reality lost customer service time is likely to be
significantly less than this since the above calculation:

(i) makes no allowance for the possibility of directing customers to other counters
during an incident

POL00325269
POL00325269

ICL Acceptance Incident 298 — Resolution Ref: CR/ACD/298

Version: 0.8
Pathway Plan Date: 23/9/99

(ii) makes no allowance for that proportion of incidents which occur during back
office processing and have no direct impact on customer service.

The incident analysis which has been jointly undertaken to date and the improved
level of understanding of system usage within the live outlets both suggest that the
target will be met within the projected 6 months. The most recent rate of authorised
reboot incidents is approaching half the initial target level, leaving a further required
halving to reach the final target. Pathway has undertaken analysis of several
outstanding incidents and diagnosed the detail of the problem. Software fixes will be
progressively released following regression testing which will see a further reduction
on the current incident rates towards the target. Hence the progression towards the
target is already substantially underpinned by known, diagnosed problems which are
awaiting fix issue.

5.5 Improved Defect Removal for Future Releases

The level of testing conducted on the Pathway solution has by any standard been
exceptionally high (over 100 dedicated testers, a staggering array of test
environments, at a cost of 10s of £Millions). The large, complex and distributed
nature of the system demands a sophisticated multi-layered approach to testing and
integration. The strategy was developed and agreed in conjunction with the sponsor
organisations at the outset, and was independently assessed during the treasury review
as being ‘leading edge’. It has been maintained in the light of experience of Release 1,
and is currently again under review in respect of Release 2 (CSR). Of particular
importance here is the experience of the Live Trial period, and the lessons that may be
learned to further improve the Defect Removal rate for future releases, and so reduce
the number of incidents encountered in the Live Estate.

5.5.1 PINICL Analysis

A review is underway of all the PinICL fixes applied across the whole of the Counter
systems for the Live Trial Period. This period was split into 3, known as LT1, LT2,
and CSR. Initial findings, measuring up to 31/08/99, indicate that a total of 133
PinICLs were involved. Of these, 2 were data related (including 1 on POCL Reference
Data), 1 was build related, and 2 were purely administrational to introduce the
decommissioning of BPS, leaving 128 software faults to be considered in all. (It may
be of interest to note here that about 30 of these were for BPS, although this does not
have a material bearing on the analysis.)

Of these 128 faults, just 50 were actually raised from activity in the Live Trial. The
other 78 were all in fact raised during the course of testing. (Most of these were found
long before the Live Trial in Pathway’s System Test and Integration Test stages or in
the MOT/E2E test stages immediately before the Live Trial. These were the subjects
of agreed deferral via the KPR process, to allow for their controlled introduction

during the course of the Live Trial, to avoid destabilisation. A small number were
raised after the KPR, as a result of Pathway’s ongoing regression testing)

The records for these PinICLs have been analysed to determine the nature of the
defects concerned. As a result they have been categorised accordingly, to help assess
how best the Development Lifecycle, and in particular the testing and integration
approach, may be revised to best detect such defects earlier, and so better protect the
Live service. A large number of low level classifications were used, which can be
summarised into the following high level categories:

1, Usability/Robustness:
MMI, Menus, Button locking, No-Entry signs, Double key stokes, Cosmetics,
Enforcement of correct practice, Operational usability, Correct error handling, etc.
2. Stability/Performance:

Screen freezes, Printer hangs, Memory leaks, Blue screens, NT messages,
Archiving anomalies, Function performance.

3. Application Logic:

Plain software bugs.

Initial findings indicate that the 128 fixes applied to during the Live Trial (78 faults
found in Testing and 50 faults found in Live) can be categorised as follows:

Category Testing Faults Live Faults
Usability/Robustness 38 38
Stability/Performance 14 5
Application Logic 26 7

(To set these figures in context, overall testing has trapped several thousand defects,
commensurate with the great size and complexity of this system.)

The following conclusions can be drawn:

e The overall approach has been extremely successful in reducing the exposure of
the Live Estate to a very small residue of defects remaining in the system (which
the industry recognises can never be entirely eliminated, although there is
always room to improve).

e The incidence of defects discovered is demonstrably reducing over time,
indicating a steady improvement in overall system stability.

POL00325269
POL00325269

ICL Acceptance Incident 298 — Resolution Ref: CR/ACD/298

Version: 0.8
Pathway Plan Date: 23/9/99

e There is clear evidence that the majority of defects in the Usability/Robustness
category have been trapped during testing, despite this being a notoriously
difficult and expensive problem domain to address exhaustively through testing.

e Nonetheless, the majority of defects escaping capture during test are in the
category Usability/Robustness, suggesting that there really is no substitute for
genuine Live exposure to flush out these types of defect (as per generally
accepted industry wisdom). It also suggests that this is the main area to target for
future improvement, offering more scope. Further to this, the report from the
EPOSS Defensive Test exercise was encouraging. It indicates that such short
focussed test activities, concentrating on particular aspects of system usage, can
have considerable success in removing defects both of the Usability/Robustness
and Stability/Performance categories.

(The EPOSS Defensive Test exercise was an additional test initiative introduced
by Pathway to satisfy test objectives relating to Usability/Robustness, which it
was recognised had not been fully met by the Model Office exercise and the
EPOSS Usability Trial.)

e Testing has eradicated all but a very few remaining Stability/Performance
defects, albeit that these can impart a disproportionate effect on the Live Estate,
further suggesting the importance of a Live Trial or equivalent period, where the
impact on the business can be limited and controlled. The fact that a significant
number of such defects were still being discovered in these late testing stages
indicates that there is potential for improvement here also. It suggests that a
more detailed analysis of the precise circumstances of these defects should be
conducted to determine any common factors and to assess whether any benefit is
to be had from specific testing actions earlier in the lifecycle.

e Testing has eradicated all but a very few remaining Application Logic defects.
Little scope for improvement in this area, other than the perpetual goal of earlier
discovery.

A further observation arising from the analysis would be that many of the PinICLs
arising in the Live Trial system had in fact been the subjects of earlier PinICLs raised
during the course of Testing. This is a common phenomenon. Typically it comes
about because for certain classes of defect (particularly where it is related to timing, or
multiple streams of activity in combination) the symptoms revealing the defect can
not easily be reproduced until the underlying defect is properly understood. Because it
cannot be reproduced the underlying defect can not be properly diagnosed. The faults
are then often put down to some flaw in the test environment, or the wrong code
versions being used, and the PinICL is closed ‘unable to reproduce’. There is no easy
remedy.

5.5.2 Implications for CSR+

A full review of the testing conducted for Release 2 (CSR) has already been
conducted and a proposal document has been drafted “ Revisions to the Testing &
Integration Approach for Pathway Release CSR+”. Based on the findings above ICL
Pathway and POCL will jointly consider the following proposals, and as agreed
include them within a definitive version of that document. This review will take
place by 30/10/99 and the definitive version of that document will be published by
24/11/99 and brought into effect from this date

a) Analyse the precise circumstances of the defects in the Stability/Performance
category. Identify any common factors.

b) Analyse the precise circumstances of the defects in the Usability/Robustness
category. Identify any common factors.

c) From (a) and (b) above, establish any potential test points for existing testing
stages, and, as reasonably necessary, extend their respective objectives/review-
checklists accordingly. (Include Unit Test, System Test, and Conformance Test.)

d) As reasonably necessary, extend Code Review checklists to cover the specifics
from (a) & (b) above, with particular emphasis on the handling of exception
conditions.

e) Adopt the principles of the EPOSS Defensive Test exercise for wider application,
and in particular to mount earlier exercises specifically targeting those attributes
identified in (a) and (b) above. It is important that such test activities include the
involvement of design-aware ‘experts’ having intimate knowledge of system
areas subject to test and capable of targeting potential areas of weakness.
Involvement of Users should also be considered to address usability related
aspects.

f) Work with POCL in determining appropriate and agreeable alternative(s) to the
Live Trial for future releases, to allow each new product to be exposed to
substantial Live use, but with limited business impact, for an appropriate period
of time prior to general (national) release.

It should be noted that CSR+ has already benefited from the revisions included in the
Testing Strategy and will, in due course, from the additions listed above. A lifecycle-
wide review was also conducted earlier in the year, which resulted in a major
reorganisation of the Systems and Programmes Directorates into the new
Development Directorate. Amongst the initiatives introduced at that time were many
which addressed lessons learned from earlier releases to improve the Design and
Development stages for CSR+ and beyond. Of particular relevance here are:

a) The formation of Delivery Units, focussing on particular Business and
Infrastructure areas, made up of mixed discipline teams combining Design,
Development, Unit Test, and System Test, and so promoting higher product
quality levels and greater lifecycle awareness. As each Delivery Unit spans all the
platforms supporting the end to end business applications within their respective
areas, this will also help to address the risks previously associated with cross-
paradigm boundaries.

b) The formation of the Technical Design Authority, providing central support to
the Delivery Units, with particular responsibility to oversee the end to end design
and ensure the overall technical integrity of the solution as a whole. One activity
currently under way is the systematic retrospective reviews of the end to end
Designs across the whole solution for CSR+. It should be noted here that these
reviews are not restricted to targeted reviews of the changes at CSR+ but also
encompass those areas of CSR+ inherited from CSR. (For example, it is planned
to review the EPOSS, TPS and RDMC/RDDS systems on an end to end basis,
not just the minor changes made in these areas at CSR+.) Pathway will also
consider seeking the involvement in these reviews of other expert areas within
ICL, external to Pathway, to bring an independent view for certain critical areas.

c) General improvements in the areas of Design Review, Code review, Module Test
Review and Link Test Review.

d) Strengthening of Product Acceptance Test (on entry to Pathway) for 3“ Party
developments.

e) Closer working relationship between the Delivery Units and the Technical
Integration area to promote rapid environment stabilisation.

Pathway already has in train a set of initiatives to improve the defensive measures
deployed within the system in key risk areas. Much has already been done to
introduce interlocks within the counter applications to preserve and protect the serial
dependencies inherent in the VB runtime environment. This in large measure has
eliminated the specific “double entry’ and parallel process ‘hanging’ issues underlying
many of the Usability/Robustness and Stability/Performance problems. The future
strategic goal here is the gradual introduction of more generic defensive measures,
including a full cross-phase locking mechanism.

Following on from the recent investigations into residual memory problems under
certain complex scenarios, Pathway has decided to deploy the BUSY.EXE toolset
more widely in testing for CSR+, using it in a pre-emptive fashion rather than purely
as a debug tool.

ICL Pathway believes that introducing further changes to the Design and
Development stages (other than ensuring that good practice is maintained) would

result in only a marginal reduction of the defects in question. The majority of the
CSR+ functionality has now entered Link Test or System Test, so it would be sensible
at this stage to focus in these and later stages of the lifecycle.

1 Introduction

This defines the content and production plan for the document:
“ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS”
This document is for internal Pathway use by application developers.

It is also to be supplied under the Contract (in compliance with Requirements R469,
R470 and R869(part)) to POCL for the purpose of enabling POCL to procure
applications to run on the Service Infrastructure (i.e. interfacing with OPS and TMS).
As such it will be provided to Third Parties.

The OPS Architecture Specification describes the architecture for counter applications
operating within the OPS/TMS framework, and describes the interaction of counter
applications with OPS and TMS. The document expands on the architecture set out in
the OPS Architecture Specification.

2 Scope

The document is intended for application developers within ICL Pathway or Third
Parties. The purpose of the document is to enable developers to understand the
architecture employed and the facilities available within the ICL Pathway solution,
utilising OPS, TMS and EPOSS. The document is intended to provide developers
with sufficient details to plan the development of new applications operating in this
environment. The developers may be ICL Pathway staff, POCL staff or Third Parties.
The document will contain definitions of those Pathway specific APIs essential to
utilising OPS, TMS and EPOSS.

In the context of the Contract, it is available to POCL to enable the procurement
process. Any supplier of Riposte based applications must obtain a development
licence from Escher, who would supply the reference manuals for the Escher specific
APIs:

Escher Group Ltd.
101 Main Street
Cambridge
Massachusetts
USA

3 Document Standards

ICL Pathway shall produce the document in accordance with the ICL Pathway On-
Line Standards for document production. In essence, the document shall conform to a
standard template, be written in Microsoft Word and shall be subject to a document
review cycle, with comments and responses being formally recorded.

Analysis of Acceptance Incident (6)
IAll incidents identified by TIP relating to file and/or transaction delivery were reviewed at Chesterfield (29/7/99); a
further incident (TIP889 — 3/8) is under investigation. Incidents fall into two categories, plus a further question
relating to FTMS gateway file housekeeping.

1. Delayed transaction delivery from outlets.

Transactions are not harvested from Outlets in the following circumstances:

1. One or more Counter PCs cannot be synchronised with the Gateway PC at the post office. This may be because
they have a fault, or because they have been switched off.

2. Ata single counter post office, there is a fault with the mirror disk

3. Failure of the Gateway PC

4. Failure to communicate via the ISDN line

These conditions are characterised by there not being an End of Day marker in the central journal file for the Outlet
concerned (“non-polled post office”).

The facility to monitor and report on non-polled outlets was part of the BES harvesting suite, removed following DSS.
Iwithdrawal. Since then an ad-hoc database analysis has been in place to identify such outlets and a new ongoing
reporting system is in the process of introduction (CP2078) to produce an automatic report which is emailed daily to
the Business Support Unit who log an incident with the HSH for immediate investigation.

2. Files delivered late from the TPS Hosts to TIP
‘This can happen if a fault has occurred during the processing cycle such that the delays incurred mean that the
production and transmission of the files for TIP in not in line with the SLAs.

‘The majority of incidents reported under this category have occurred during failover testing between Wigan and
Bootle sites, which represent exceptional circumstances and are not representative of normal systems operation.

3. File Housekeeping on FTMS gateway servers

The housekeeping in the FTMS servers has been corrected (PINICL 27537) to ensure that files for each Service (e.g.
TIP) are only held for the period set out in the corresponding AIS. This is documented in "Pathway to Post Office
‘Technical Specification" ref. TVIFS/008 section 6.2.3. Details of the parameters for the file retention period are
given in the internal design document "FTMS Configurations for Pathway TPS and POCL TIP Links at Release 2"
(ref. TDAION/005).

Clearance Action (7)
‘This is essentially the same as that proposed for AI371, relating to HAPS SLA.

Version 1.0 1 of3 24 September 1999
POL00325269
POL00325269

Second Supplemental Agreement Annex to Schedule 2

Procedures Required
Procedures are required to cover the following.

1. An incident to be raised with the Horizon System Helpdesk at the earliest appropriate time when an Outlet is not
polled.

2. Pathway to produce daily (internal) reports monitoring the transmission of the TIP files, the numbers of files and
ithe times of transmission and receipt acknowledgement.

Progam Changes Required

1. An automatic report to be produced overnight to detect instances of non-polled post offices, and an email report
automatically sent to the Business Support Unit (BSU). This daily report will list:

I- Date of report

I- FAD code

I- Date since the Outlet was last polled

This will be implemented during CSR as an urgent development.

[Note ~ This facility has been developed and is expected to be Released shortly.]

‘The BSU will follow the new procedure set out in the “New Procedures” section below.
INew Procedures

a. Non-Polled Outlets

1. The BSU have implemented a new procedure whereby they report incidents of non-polled post offices to the HSH.
This is currently done on receipt of a manually produced report of non-polled post offices. This report is due to be
produced automatically (see item 2 in “Program Changes Required”.

Status: This procedure has been implemented. It is possible to email a copy of this manually produced report to a
central POCL Service Management function as an interim measure before the procedure set out in item 2 below is
available.

2. Customer Services require a procedure whereby they update the “On-Line Problem Management Database” Web
Page. This is an existing Web Page, which is accessible to POCL Service Management, and lists various problem
issues. This will enable the TIP team to enquire on non-polled post offices.

Status: This procedure has been agreed and will be implemented when the automatically produced non-polled
report is available (see item 2 Program Changes Required).

b. Central Processing Delays

1. A draft copy of the Interim Transaction Information Processing System ICL Pathway Operating Level dated
15/03/99) has been sent to POCL for review. In discussions, TIP have indicated that they do not require advance
warning of potential delays in TIP files being sent to TIP. There are contractual remedies if Pathway fail to meet the
SLA timescales.

Status: The Operating Level Agreement is in draft form and Pathway is waiting on POCL for comments. The draft
OLA does not include provision for Pathway Operations to inform TIP Operations of likely delays in the
transmission of TIP files.

2. Pathway OSD have implemented a new procedure whereby they produce a daily Operations Service Management
Report.
Status: This is for internal Service Management only, but does show the transmission of the TIP files, the numbers

nf files and tho times af trancmiscion and rereint acknowlodeoment

Version 1.0 2 of 3 24 September 1999
Second Supplemental Agreement Annex to Schedule 2

of files and the times of transmission and receipt acknowledgement,

Pathway believes that the actions put in place provide adequate assurance that appropriate procedures exist for
dealing with potential service delivery problems on an ongoing basis. If SLAs are not met, for any reason, remedies
will apply as per G10 Schedule. Specific ongoing monitoring of non-polled outlets can be continued via the
mechanism described above, if desired by TIP.

On this basis Pathway believes the incident is, in effect, resolved, and an extended period of monitoring to 1/10/99 is
proposed during which the specific actions within the Clearance Actions will be checked for completion.

This Clearance Action has been agreed by POCL and this Analysis form documents that agreement in accordance

ICL Pathway Acceptance Proposal Ref: CR/ACD/372
. Version: 0.4
Acceptance Incident 372 Date: 16/9/99

1. Purpose

This document sets out the ICL Pathway proposal to the Expert with respect to
Acceptance Incident 372.

2. Summary

ICL Pathway accepts that there were some system management incidents during the
CSR LT1 to LT2 system upgrade activity during the Live Trial period. Although the
scale of problems was relatively modest for the number of outlets involved (299), the
problems encountered, if left uncorrected, would cause difficulties in rolling out future
software upgrades to a much larger live estate. Thus ICL Pathway accepted a Medium
severity assessment.

Since the Acceptance Incident was raised the three important issues, that were the root
cause of the incidents, have all been fixed and details have been provided to POCL.
Ongoing monitoring and reporting of the systems management operations are already
in place, with details provided routinely to POCL via the ICL Pathway web site.

Specific technical questions relating to the performance and scalability of the software
distribution product and its method of operation have been answered in a detailed
technical presentation.

Specific further commitments have been given concerning the nature of CP2116 and
the content of a “substantial software download”.

Other lessons learned from the upgrade exercise will be incorporated in the planning
of the next software upgrade, expected to be CSR to CSR+ during 2000. POCL will
be invited to participate in that exercise (as they were in the LT1 to LT2 exercise), but
ICL Pathway cannot currently provide a date for this exercise since it has not yet
completed the planning stage. On the basis of the measures already in place, ICL
Pathway assesses the incident severity as “Low”.

3. Criteria

The Criterion under test is 37/1.

4. POCL position

Based upon the minutes of the Acceptance Board Meeting of 18 August 1999, POCL
contended that:

“there is lack of evidence on resolution to enable the current plan to be agreed”.
“the plan does not contain clear dates and deliverables”.

POCL have also expressed the desire to see a “dress rehearsal” of the next major
upgrade exercise using the (to be) developed scripts applied to a “small test estate”.

Acceptance Incident 372 Date: 16/9/99

5. ICL Pathway position

5.1 Evidence to enable the plan to be agreed

5.1.1 Report of the upgrade exercise and technical briefing

ICL Pathway has already provided a very full and detailed report on the CSR LT1 to
LT2 upgrade exercise. This report includes:

e the full history of the weekend exercise

* astatement of problem areas encountered

e the decisions taken to overcome various problem as they arose

e references to ongoing operating procedures that will be improved

* recommended improvements, that will be incorporated into future system
upgrade exercises

POCL has reviewed the report and raised further questions, to which ICL Pathway has
also responded. ICL Pathway has also held a detailed technical briefing session for
POCL with the ICL Pathway senior systems designer covering the overall system
management procedures and products used.

5.1.2 Analysis of the Incident

ICL Pathway has accepted that some aspects of the LT1 to LT2 upgrade identified
problems in the systems management process. Three specific issues were identified:

1. The procedure for delivering one element of Reference Data (“Type D”
Reference Data) was not properly established, resulting in this Reference Data
being missing from some outlets and delaying the upgrade programme whilst
in-flight rectification was undertaken

2. The procedure for dealing with “Error Type 221” reports from the Tivoli
system management software was incorrectly specified, resulting in operations
staff following an unnecessary, but safe, procedure to manually control the
software upgrade on a site by site basis, rather than controlling the distribution
automatically using the Automated Targeting Engine. This resulted in a
somewhat extended time to complete the upgrade compared with the planned
time.

3. A specific technical fault was identified within the Automated Targeting
Engine, causing long error messages from an outlet being incorrectly handled.

In addition potential improvements were noted to several operational activities during
the LT1 to LT2 upgrade exercise and these will be fed into the planning activity for
the next software upgrade, although this has not yet reached a formally planned state.

5.2 Clearance plan

The agreed Clearance Plan is based upon:

POL00325269

POL00325269
ICL Pathway Acceptance Proposal Ref: CR/ACD/372
Version: 0.4
Acceptance Incident 372 Date: 16/9/99

1. Actions to correct the three specific faults identified above.

These actions have all been completed and details made available to POCL.

2. The provision of additional technical details to POCL in response to comments
on the LT1 to LT2 upgrade report, specifically on the use of the Tivoli
software and the capabilities of the ATE.

This has been completed in the form of a detailed presentation to POCL staff
by the ICL Pathway senior designer responsible for systems management.

3. The provision of ongoing monitoring of the software distribution process,
using the ATE, with regular statistics provided on the ICL Pathway web site of
software distribution to the live estate (software details, start date, 95%, 99%
and 100% complete dates).

This action has been completed with the exception of adding details on the
99% completion date. ICL Pathway offers to provide this within one month.
In addition if POCL wish to view the use of the ATE in this situation ICL
Pathway has offered to provide this. Systems management capability is an
ongoing agenda item at the monthly Service Review Forum meetings where
any questions or issues arising from this ongoing monitoring / reporting can
be raised for discussion and resolution.

4. The provision for joint input by POCL and ICL Pathway into the next upgrade
plan (expected to be CSR to CSR+ during the first half of year 2000), allowing
POCL to have assurance that any concerns arising from the last upgrade
exercise have been addressed within the plans for the next.

This undertaking has been provided. The dates and details for this exercise
are beyond the current planning window but planning is expected to start
towards the end of this year or early next year. (Note that each upgrade
situation is individually planned according to the volume of software to be
distributed, the size of the live estate, the hours of operation of the outlets
involved, etc.)

5. Although ICL Pathway believes the above actions are comprehensive, should
POCL have residual concerns as to the capability of the systems management
service to cope with a substantial upgrade activity, ICL Pathway has also
proposed that CSR+ will initially be distributed to an agreed subset of live
offices prior to full roll-out. This offers the opportunity to review software
distribution capability in a live trial environment prior to commitment to the
entire live estate. At the time of writing, this particular exercise lies beyond
the current planning window (and hence cannot be assigned a specific date)
but would form part of the agreed CSR+ introduction plan.

6. dll file checking.

ICL Pathway has developed a Systems Management task that checks the
structure of .dll files in prescribed system directories for content integrity.
This task can be executed on a one shot basis at a particular outlet, or can be

. Version: 0.4
Acceptance Incident 372 Date: 16/9/99

consolidated with other systems maintenance activities in the regular overnight
script (this also reloads the Riposte desktop, for example).

CP 2116 is being implemented to provide this regular overnight capability.

ICL Pathway will continue to run the .dll contents check on potentially
affected files within the overnight activities until an agreed closure criterion is
achieved. This will be either:

e diagnosis and fix of the underlying corruption problem, or:

¢ asubstantial software download has occurred followed by a clear period
of 3 months running with no detected .dll file corruptions.

Pathway confirms that .exe and .ocx files are also checked per CP 2116.
7. ATE (Automated Targeting Engine) functioning

The incident that occurred during the LT2 upgrade has been tested and fixed
(incorrect handling of long error messages). The fault was recorded and
cleared through the OSD fault notification process (PinICL is used for
Pathway related incidents). Further details have been supplied by OSD on the
nature of the fault and the resolution undertaken:

Messages in the Tivoli Log that exceed 512 bytes caused an error in ATE due
to a string size allocated not being long enough. The change required was to
terminate the log messages to a maximum of 512 bytes. Testing was
performed by simulating a Tivoli log with a message greater then 512 bytes
and was implemented with a new release of ATE.

As noted previously the ATE is in regular usage. ICL Pathway continues to
demonstrate its usage during normal operational management of the live
estate. Consistent with this usage, ICL Pathway will consolidate distributions
representative of the LT2 distribution during the next three months live
operation. (Representative in this sense is taken to include elements of both
Riposte and the Pathway counter applications.)

These distributions will be:

I. Riposte Peripheral Server (update #20). The characteristics of this
upgrade are that it involves complex interaction between parts of ICL
Pathway, and is defined by three Release Notes with detailed
interdependencies.

2. Consolidated EPOSS/Counter Applications Upgrade. This is
distinguished by its relative size, several Mbs.

Appropriate supporting documentation will be supplied, including
interdependencies, activity logs and statements of how any exceptions were
handled.

5.2.1 Clearance plan summary
All important Clearance plan activities have been completed.

Ongoing monitoring of software distribution activities is already provided (with a
further minor extension planned) and an appropriate review forum identified for
resolution of any matters arising.

The principle of POCL involvement in the planning of such software upgrade
exercises is already established and will continue into future exercises such as the
CSR+ upgrade. This can include further assurance of software distribution capability
within a live trial context.

1 Purpose

This document sets out ICL Pathway’s proposal that Acceptance Incident 376,
currently categorised as Medium by Pathway and High by POCL, should be
recategorised by POCL as Medium, and that the Resolution Plan is satisfactory and
should be agreed.

2 Summary

Pathway contends that there are Clearance Actions that address the three remaining
issues defined by POCL.

The issue relates to not passing records to TIP because of harvester exceptions caused
by missing functions in counter code. ICL Pathway has taken measures to both stop
known occurrences and to ensure that any unforeseen occurrences are reported both to
TIP and to ICL Pathway development.

The occurrence of a functionally unrelated incident considered under this Acceptance
Incident, the omission of records from the counter cash account, concerned only
voucher products. This omission is in process of elimination. In addition procedures
have been tightened to minimise the risk of product withdrawals causing operational
difficulties at the counter.

Furthermore, additional reconciliation features that confirm the integrity of data
passing to TIP have been proposed.

3 = Criteria

Criterion 831/1 is cited: “The Contractor shall support interface from TMS and
Outlets to Transaction Information Processing (TIP).

4  POCL position

Based upon the minutes of the Acceptance Board Meeting of 18 August 1999, POCL
contended that:
“the plan is still immature” .

“the proposal not to deliver the additional controls until March 2000 is not
acceptable” .

“the latest analysis performed on Incident 410 ... has revealed further unresolved
deficiencies and the workaround for these is not agreed” .

5 Pathway position

5.1 Background

During the Live Trial, and since, incidents have occurred that, in POCL’s view,
constitute a potential threat to the integrity of their accounts. These are tracked in
A1376, TIP Acceptance Incident Status, and associated Root Cause Analysis.

5.2 Maturity of plan

The elements of the resolution plan are defined as activities within the integrated
Acceptance Resolution Plan (currently version 0.9, 16/9/99).

The Pathway proposal in this area has now been expanded into the High Level Design
document Logical Design for EPOSS/TIP Reconciliation Controls. The joint working
group has reviewed this in detail. This document provides a description of how
Pathway will provide additional reconciliation between the Cash Account produced in
the outlet and the transactions sent to TIP. It contains detailed proposals for
enhancements to counter processing, harvesting and the TPS Host.

5.3 Delivery of additional controls

Clearance action:

The document Logical Design for EPOSS/TIP Reconciliation Controls, Version
0.7, 20/9/99 has been agreed and the enhancements will be in service by 31/12/99.

5.3.1 Ongoing Analysis And Review Of Incidents

ICL Pathway will continue to analyse new incidents and will issue periodic updates of
the TIP Incident Status Report. This report will be reviewed jointly fortnightly or as
required.

ICL Pathway’s objective is to eliminate the root causes of such incidents as are
described in Section 2 above, while providing a clear method of communicating rare
error corrections.

5.3.2 Development Of Additional Reconciliation Controls

Additional controls through the introduction of reconciliation will be developed as
described in the document Logical Design for EPOSS/TIP Reconciliation Controls.

POCL's requirement to have continued visibility of the functionality of the solution
will be met by re-issues of the above-mentioned document. Should low level design
affect any area within the high level design, then the Logical Design document will be
updated and re-issued to POCL.

Pathway is currently providing Harvester exception reporting and will continue to do
so until the additional Reconciliation Controls have entered service.

POL00325269
ICL Acceptance Resolution Plan Refi CR/ACD/376
Pathway . Version: 0.9
Acceptance Incident 376 Date: 23/9/99

POCL is concerned regarding assurance of testing plans and testing activities. ICL
Pathway will issue the High Level Test Plans (HLTPs) to POCL for the additional
reconciliation controls and will also issue the corresponding Test Reports, both for
comment. POCL will provide such comments in a single batch for each of the HLTPs
and Test Reports within two weeks of their provision to POCL. In addition, POCL,
may witness testing. The testing strategy to be adopted for this Plan will be
documented and provided te POCL.

5.3.3 Additional Reconciliation Procedures

POCL has observed that joint procedures for dealing with reconciliation incidents
need to be developed. ICL Pathway recognises the need for such procedures and will
work jointly with POCL to develop them. It is agreed that these procedures will
embrace the following five points:

1. POCL will accept manual error corrections of either transaction record errors
or cash account stream record errors up to an aggregate level of 50 per week

2. Above this level Pathway will fix errors and (re)submit the data electronically
to the TIP interface, unless agreed otherwise by POCL.

3. Manual error reports are to include a full specification of the repaired
transaction data, such that the data would pass the integrity checks if
resubmitted. Where it is necessary to make a judgement about a repair, such
judgement will be declared explicitly by Pathway. Data is to be presented in a
suitable format for POCL to key into a POCL data input facility.

4. The delay between the occurrence of an error (or where applicable its later
detection) and the notification of the correction to POCL (either manually in
accordance with (1) above or electronically in accordance with (2) above) shall
not exceed five working days.

5. Pathway is to pay POCL liquidated damages of £100 per transaction error
correction submitted manually.

The Contractor shall test the procedure described in sub paragraph (2) above prior to
the implementation of the additional reconciliation controls and POCL shall assist and
witness the attainment of the outcome.

The above procedures shall be introduced at the same time as the additional
reconciliation controls referred to in paragraph 5.3.2 above

5.4 Core to non-core (AI410)

Clearance action:

The document, Ceasing of Non-Core Products at Outlets, is agreed and ICL Pathway
will implement the defined functions for CSR+.

Acceptance Incident 376 Date: 23/9/99

5.4.1 The position at CSR
Refinement to product management procedures at CSR:

AI 410, although related to AI 376 through the generality of reconciliation of the Cash
Account and the TIP stream, is in fact the reverse condition: a record that was not
incorporated in the Cash Account was received by TIP.

This condition was caused by ceasing a product at an outlet by changing it from a
Core product (transacted at all outlets) to Non-core (transacted at only a subset). This
resulted in “end dating” the Item Reference Data at an outlet that had not received
replacement non-core reference data but had transacted the product earlier in the
week. EPOSS did not include transactions in the Cash Account that had occurred
immediately before the product was end-dated at the outlet.

It had been agreed, for CSR, that Operational Business Change procedures would
screen out cases of Item Reference Data being end-dated, the outlet would not be able
to perform housekeeping functions such as remitting out remaining inventory in any
case. The agreed process for removal from sale is by use of changes to the Menu
Hierarchy.

Unfortunately neither POCL nor Pathway staff involved had realised that changing a
product from Core to Non core would result in just such a cessation. Procedure
documentation has now been amended to make this case explicit.

ICL Pathway is introducing a change to ensure that all transactions for end-dated
products appear in the cash account. This will provide full accounting integrity.

The parties shall carry out the procedures described in the document Process For
Removing Products From Outlets At CSR, Version 0.3. These procedures will be
revisited if experience so indicates.

Introduction of an enhanced proposal for item transaction modes at CSR+:

A feature, Item Transaction Mode, is scheduled for introduction at CSR+ and will
provide a comprehensive means of controlling the classes of transaction that can be
applied to products. However, in the course of considering these issues it was further
realised that no provision at CSR+ in interfaces and designs had been made for the
particular case of end-dating Non-core products in individual outlets.

This issue, ceasing Non-core products at individual outlets at CSR+, has been
addressed in the document Ceasing of Non-Core Products at Outlets, which was
published on 24/8/99, and which POCL has confirmed is acceptable.

6 Closure Criteria

The closure criteria agreed between the parties are:
1. That there will be an Observation Period of six weeks starting 1" October 1999.

2. During the Observation Period there will be no reoccurrence of previously fixed
faults

POL00325269
ICL Acceptance Resolution Plan Ref: CR/ACD/376
Pathway . Version: 0.9
Acceptance Incident 376 Date: 23/9/99

3. During the Observation Period not more that 0.6% of Cash Accounts sent to TIP
will be found by TIP not to reconcile to the Cash Account derived by TIP from the
transaction stream due to Pathway processing error.

4. During the Observation Period Pathway will analyse all new incidents within 10
working days, and report these analyses to TIP using the established TIP Incident
Status format. The 10 days starts from the time TIP log the incident on the
Pathway helpdesk. The analysis is to include an expected fix implementation
date. For incidents that cannot be reproduced the result of analysis may be to
implement diagnostic code.

5. There will be a period of parallel running of the Pathway and TIP reconciliation
process during which the Pathway solution must find at least all those
reconciliation failures correctly reported by TIP.

Pathway Reconciliation Controls ‘ion Ooo
1 Scope

This document describes the processes to be introduced to the POCL Infrastructure
products to reconcile the transaction details and cash account details passed to POCL
TIP against the details captured at the counters.

The level of detail given is adequate to enable POCL to ascertain that the solution will
deliver the business requirement, which is to report all incidents in which either
transactions recorded at the counter are not both sent to TIP and brought to account in
the outlet Cash Account, or that the outlet cash account is not correctly transmitted to
TIP.

This document is the principle vehicle for communicating the reconciliation design to
POCL and will be re-issued as necessary.

2 Introduction

This document describes the processes that will be put in place to ensure that:

¢ The accounting transaction data recorded by the EPOSS system on the OPS can be
reconciled with the accounting transaction data returned to the POCL TIP system
across the TIP interface

@ The accounting transaction data written each day at the OPS can be reconciled
with the Cash Account data written at the OPS when the Cash Account is
produced

¢ The Outlet Stock Holdings generated at the end of a Cash Account Period at the
OPS can be reconciled with the Outlet Stock Holdings transferred to TIP across
the TIP Interface

¢ The Cash Account Line records generated at the OPS can be reconciled with the
Cash Account Line records returned to TIP across the TIP Interface

The processes to be put in place will be delivered through the implementation of new
software functionality at both the OPS and TPS Host systems. Where a new OPS
function is delivered to generate control totals, the function will be designed to
calculate the totals by a means different to that used in the current OPS functionality
which generates balancing and Cash Account data. This approach is being taken to
ensure that if the same total is calculated by two separate logical processes then there
can be a high level of assurance in the integrity of the data.

3 Overview

The reconciliation processes will be split into two separate sets of activity, Daily
reconciliation tasks and Weekly (or more accurately at the end of each CAP)
reconciliation tasks.

POL00325269

ICL Logical Design for EPOSS/TIP Ref: PI/DES/002

wp ge Version: 0.7
Pathway Reconciliation Controls Date: 20/09/99

The daily tasks will ensure that the base transaction data recorded at the counter
matches the base transaction data transferred to TIP for that day. At the same time,
the transactions will be used to generate control totals for the Cash Account tables to
which the transaction will report at the end of the CAP.

At the end of the CAP, the daily control totals generated for each Cash Account table
will be accumulated and the resulting value calculated for the Payments and Receipt
tables will be compared with the Cash Account line records generated by the Cash
Account production process. If there is a discrepancy in this comparison then the
system will validate each of the accumulated daily control totals with the
corresponding Cash Account line records to identify the table which does not
reconcile and record an error message in the Riposte message store.

The existing functions in the system which create the outlet stock holding records and
the Cash Account Line records will also be amended to accumulate a control total for
each set of records which will be written into the message store at the end of each set.
These control total records will be harvested and inserted into the TPS Host database.
The TPS Host system will compare the Stock Holding records (‘STX’ records) and
the Cash Account Line records (‘CAC’ records) output to the TIP Cash Account sub-
file with the control totals received from the OPS system. In the event that the TPS
harvester fails to locate either the Stock Holding records (“STX’ records) or the Cash
Account Line records (‘CAC’ records) or the control totals calculated by the TPS
Host system differ from the control totals received from the OPS, then a reconciliation
error report will be produced.

3.1 Daily Transaction Control Totals

At the end of each logical day (Trading Day) an End of Day process runs to insert a
marker into the Riposte Message store. This marker records the precise point in the
message store (for each node in the group) at which the End Of Day process ran. The
marker is used by the TPS Harvester process to delineate the transactions which will
be extracted from the message store and sent, via the TPS Host System, to the POCL
TIP system across the TIP Interface.

The End of Day process will be extended to include an additional set of functions to:

@ Calculate control totals of all accounting transactions recorded since the last End
of Day marker. The control total will be made up of just those transactions which
get passed through to TIP: (thus “transfers” and “remittance settlements” will
not be included since they are not passed to TIP. The full list of transaction types
not passed to TIP are listed in section 4.2.1). The control total will include the
following fields/attributes:

1. Trading Date (Date of current EOD Marker)
Total number of transactions

Total of absolute value of transaction ‘Quantity’ field

eB YON

Total of absolute value of transaction ‘SaleValue’ field

ICL Logical Design for EPOSS/TIP Ref: PI/DES/002

A Version: 0.7
Pathway Reconciliation Controls Date. 20/09/99

The control totals written by the OPS system will be harvested by the TPS Harvester
(or another specific Harvester process) and will be inserted into a new table within the
TPS Host Database. When the TPS Host system creates the TIP sub-file for an outlet
a new process will be added that independently calculates the control totals from the
records being generated in the sub-file and then compares them with the control totals
harvested from the OPS. If there is a discrepancy between the TPS and OPS
generated control totals, the following information will be written to an Exception
Report:

1. Outlet FAD code
2. The values calculated by the OPS

3. The values calculated by the TPS Host

3.2 Daily Cash Account Control Totals

At the same time that accounting transactions are read for the creation of the daily
transaction control totals (see 3.1 above), a further new function within the End of
Day process will cause the value of the transaction to be accumulated in an
appropriate control total(s) to facilitate reconciliation of the Cash Account at the end
of the Cash Account Period. This process will determine, for each transaction
processed, which Cash Account period is appropriate to the transaction (there may be
transactions for more than one CAP on any given day) and to which Cash Account
Table(s) control total the transaction is relevant. The determination of which Cash
Account Table control total is relevant will be based on the ‘Transaction Mode’ and
“Product Number’ contained in the transaction message that will then be used to
access the appropriate Cash Account Mapping reference data to determine the table
number to which the transaction relates. The control total record will include:

1. CAP Number
2. CA Table Number

3. Total number of transactions

4. Total of signed value of transaction ‘Qty’ or ‘SaleValue’ field (only one of these
attributes is present in each CA Line message).

Use of the Transaction Mode, Product Number and Cash Account Mapping data to
determine the appropriate CA Table control total will ensure that the total is derived
by a separate logical process from that used during the production of the Cash
Account itself. Cash Account production relies on the use of product ‘Primary
Mappings’ and ‘Secondary Mappings’ to aggregate transactions at the stock unit and
office levels before the Cash Account mappings are used to generate the final Cash
Account values.

Pathway Reconciliation Controls Date. 20/09/99

If any transactions are found which are not possible to map to a CA Table, their
details are added together and included in a Control Total for CA Table Number
“XX”. These are exceptions. The corresponding error transactions will be flagged in
message store from where they will be harvested as Counter detected errors.
Harvested errors will be written to an Exception Report for action via the normal RED
processes. The report will contain:

1. Outlet FAD code
2. The unique message number of the failed transaction

The Mode in which the transaction took place

w

The stock unit in which the transaction took place
The product number of the failed transaction

The Sale Value of the failed transaction

aan

The reason that the transaction failed to be mapped

3.3. Weekly Cash Account Control Totals

At the time that the Cash Account ‘Trial Report’ is produced the OPS system creates a
set of ‘Cash Account Line’ records (which reflect the line by line content of the hard-
copy print of the Cash Account).

For each set of records produced, an additional message will be written which
contains control totals. The control totals will include the following fields:

1. CAP Number
2. Total absolute number of transactions

3. Total of absolute value of transaction ‘Qty’ or ‘SaleValue’ field (only one of
these is present in each message, separate totals will be maintained for ‘Qty’
and ‘SaleValue’)

At the time that the Office is ‘rolled over’ in to the next CAP, the ‘Final Cash
Account Report’ is produced and the OPS system creates a set of ‘Office Stock
Holding’ records (which reflect the accumulation of the stock unit holdings at the end
of the CAP).

For each set of records produced, an additional message will be written which
contains control totals. The control totals will include the following fields:

1. CAP Number
2. Total absolute number of transactions
3. Total absolute value of transaction ‘Quantity’ field

4. Total of absolute value of transaction ‘“SaleValue’ field

Pathway Reconciliation Controls Date. 20/09/99

The Stock Holding and Cash Account Line Control Total records will be harvested at
the same time as the Stock Holding and Cash Account transactions are harvested and
will be written to a new table in the TPS Host System database. When the TPS Host
system creates the TIP Cash Account sub-file for an outlet a new process will be
added that independently calculates the control totals from the records being generated
in the sub-file and then compares them with the control totals harvested from the OPS.
If there is a discrepancy between the TPS and OPS generated control totals, the
following information will be written to an Exception Report:

1. Outlet FAD code

2. CAP Number

2. The values calculated by the OPS

3. The values calculated by the TPS Host

3.4 Weekly Cash Account Control Total Reconciliation

The end of day procedure which follows the Cash Account Period Rollover will
retrieve the Daily Cash Account Reconciliation Control Totals (see 3.2 above) for the
current Office CAP (including any that took place on the day of the CAP rollover).
These totals will be accumulated to derive a single total for each Cash Account Table
and totals of appropriate tables (such as the Remittance tables and the balance brought
forward for the Receipts table) will be added to the Stock, Payments and Receipt table
control totals. The values generated for the control total of each of the tables will then
be compared with the values generated for the lines recorded for the table during the
production of the Cash Account. Any difference will be identified in a message
written to the message store.

Any error messages will be subsequently harvested and inserted into a new table in
the TPS Host Database. Errors will be output to an error report.

NOTES

1. The reconciliation process will work for normal and extended cash
accounts. Extended CAPs are the same as a normal CAP except that CAP
Number increases by more than 1 and the period covered is more than 7
days

2. The reconciliation process will be unaffected by days when the Outlet is
not trading because processing is covered by resilience already built into
the end of day process.

Note: 1. Where a product reports to both a quantity and a value table on the cash
account the quantity and value in the transaction record will be accumulated
separately into the respective Cash Account Table.

2. Although the above structure contains both quantity and value counts the
majority of Cash Account Tables have only one or the other value (the
exception being Table 12). On Quantity-only tables the control total for
value will be zero. On Value-only tables the control total for quantity will
be zero.

CATable “XX” will be a special table set up to hold control totals for exception
transactions that do no map against a valid CA Table entry.

4.2 Changes to Counters

4.2.1 End of Day Architecture

ICL Logical Design for EPOSS/TIP Ref.: PI/DES/002

ae Version: 0.7
Pathway Reconciliation Controls Date: 20/09/99

In order to ensure that the record set on which the Daily Control Totals are calculated
is fixed at a point in time, the processes for calculating the totals will need to run
AFTER the EOD Marker has been inserted into the message store (since this
delineates the messages for the day). The calculation of the totals will therefore be
carried out within the EOD process using the architecture developed for CSR+ for the
creation and management of “Harvest Trailers’ (see Ref. 2). This will result in the
Control Total messages being written after the EOD Marker but before the EOD
Harvest Trailer message. The resilience of the process remains unchanged since the
EOD process itself will continue to ensure that if the process is interrupted for any
reason, then the generation of the Control Totals and the Harvest Trailer will be
carried out when the system is re-started.

4.2.2 Normal End of Day Processing

The end of day procedure will be extended to scan message store to calculate control
totals and write messages for:

¢ Daily Transaction Control Totals (see section 4.1.1), making sure that absolute
values and quantities are used. These totals will be subsequently harvested and
used by TPS Host to reconcile against the number transactions passed through to
TIP. Some transactions are not passed through to TIP so these will not be
included in the control totals: the following transactions will not be included:

- Transfers

- Transfer settlements

- Remittance settlements

- Non accounting data settlements
- Parcel traffic settlements

The identification of the products to be excluded in this way will be controlled by
the use of a piece of reference data (persistent object) in the message store.

¢@ Daily Cash Account Control Totals (see section 4.1.2), making sure that signed
values and quantities are used. These totals will subsequently be used by the
counter software to reconcile the Cash Account. Totals will be written for the
following CA Tables

- 00 Receipts (Values)

- 10 Payments (Values)

- 07 Discrepancies (Values)

- 20 Cash Stock and Vouchers in Hand (Table 5) (Values)
- 30 Receipts (Quantities)

- 40 Payments (Quantities)

- 50 Stock in Hand Breakdown (Table 5b) and Suspense Account Tables
(Values)

- 60 Remittances from other Offices (Values)

- 61 Receipt of stock from SSO (Values)
- 70 Stock Returns to SSO (Values)
- 80 Remittances to other Offices (Values)

- 90 Girobank Transaction Breakdown (Table 10f) and Parcel Traffic
(Table 12) (Values and Quantities)

- 91 Number of Transactions (Table 10g) (Quantities)

A new message will be written to message store (before the EOD Harvest Trailer) for
any transaction that is found to be in error (see section 4.1.3).

Totals for error transactions are added together and included in a special Daily Cash
Account Control total for CA Table “XX”.

4.2.3 Cash Account Processing

When the Cash Account “Trial Report’ is produced the processing will be extended to
calculate control totals and write a message for:

¢@ Weekly Cash Account Control Total (see section 4.1.4), making sure that signed
values and quantities are used. This total will be subsequently harvested and used
by TPS Host to reconcile against the number of cash account lines passed through
to TIP.

When the Cash Account *Roll-Over’ is executed the processing will be extended to
calculate control totals for the outlet stock holdings and write a message for:

@ Weekly Outlet Stock Holding Control Total (see section 4.1.4), making sure that
signed values and quantities are used. This total will be subsequently harvested
and used by TPS Host to reconcile against the number of stock holding records
passed through to TIP.

4.2.4 End of Day Processing Following Cash Account

The end of day procedure will be extended as described in Section 3.4 to retrieve the
Daily Cash Account Reconciliation Control Totals (see section 4.1.2). The total for
each table on each day will be accumulated to give a single total for each table for the
Cash Account Period. The system will then perform the following additional

calculations:
1. The totals of Table 5(b), 2 and 2(a) will be added to the control total for Table
5;

2. The total of Table 3 will be deducted from the control total for Table 5;

The Table 5 Control Total from 1&2 above will be added to the Control Total
of the Payments Table (Table 10);

4. The Control Total of the Discrepancy Table (Table 07) will be added to the
Control Total of the Payments Table (Table 10);

5. The Control Total for Tables 6 and 6(a) will be added to the Control Total of
the Receipts Table (Table 00);

6. The Balance Brought Forward value for the Current CAP will be added to the
control total of the Receipts Table (Table 00);

7. The Control Total of Tables 8 and 9 will be added to the Control Total of the
Payments Table (Table 10).

These values will then be compared against each Cash Account Table total
accumulated from the Cash Account line records written during the production of the
Cash Account.

An error messsage will be written (see 4.1.5) when the total for any table does not
match the Control Total against which it is being compared.

4.3 Changes to the Oracle Database

The following tables will be added to the database which is populated by the
Harvester and processed by TPS Host:

CA Table Number “XX” will be a special table set up to hold control totals for
exception transactions that do no map against a valid CA Table entry: Cash Account
attribute entries will be null, but Control Total entries will contain values.

Changes to TPS Agent

The Harvester will populate the new tables in the Oracle database: there may be
several entries for each FAD code.
Daily Processing

For each outlet that is harvested TPS Agent will process the Transaction Stream
Control Totals from message store and will populate the Daily Transactions Totals
table in the Oracle database.

Any transaction which it cannot harvest (because of invalid data) will be written to the
Exception Messages table (see section 4.3.4).

Any Transaction Error detected by the counter (see section 4.1.3) will also be written
to the Exception Messages table (see section 4.3.4).

Processing of Cash Account Data
For each outlet that is harvested TPS Agent will:

@ process Weekly Cash Account Stream Control Total(s) from message store to
populate the Cash Account Total Lines table in the Oracle database

process Office Stock Holding Control Total(s) from message store to populate the
Stock Detail Total Lines table in the Oracle database

Any line which it cannot harvest (because of invalid data) will be written to the
Exception Messages table (see section 4.3.4).

Any reconciliation error detected by the Counters (see 3.4 above) will be written to
the Control Exceptions table.

Changes to TPS Host

sets of totals for each outlet (see 4.6.1 below)

NOTES:

1. For control purposes a reversal will be treated in the same way as the transaction
being reversed. E.g. if the original transaction was for quantity 6 at a sales value of
£1.20, then the combination of the reversed and reversal transactions would
increment the number of transactions by 2, transaction quantity by 12, and sales
value by £2.40.

2. “Event” transactions will be ignored from the totals

5 Data Flow Diagrams

5.1 Daily Processing

The following diagram illustrates the data flow of the daily reconciliation processing:

@ Counter End of Day will process the transactions in Message Store and generate
additional messages for Daily Transaction Control Totals and Daily Cash Account
Control Totals

@ A message will also be written to Message Store for any transaction which cannot
be mapped into one of the cash account tables in the Daily Cash Account Control
Totals

@ The Daily Transaction Control Totals will be harvested and passed through to TPS
Host where they will be compared against the transactions output to TIP. Any
discrepancy will be reported as Host Detected Transaction Control Errors

¢ Any transactions which cannot be extracted by the Harvester will be posted to an
error table in the host database. This will also contain Counter Detected
Transaction Errors. This table will be processed by the host and they be reported
as Message Store errors.

If the node is restored before midnight (local
time) EOD will run as normal for that day. It
may be that such “late EODs” will not be
harvested until the next day since the EODs
may miss the 20:30 TPS harvester cut-off
time. (See also 4 — Wan failures)

Harvesters consider the following types of
failure :-

Riposte failures. If these failures are
“expected” failures such as Riposte has died,
then the agent will die leaving another
instance of the agent to tidy up The chunk
may well be marked as “Failed” (thus
requiring manual intervention by CFM before
recovery), since if Riposte has died it is likely
that other instances of the agent would have
the same problem

Oracle failures. If these failures are
“expected” failures such as Oracle having
died then the agent will die leaving another
instance of the agent to tidy up The chunk
may well be marked as “ Failed” (thus
requiring manual intervention by CFM before
recovery), since if Oracle has died it is likely
that other instances of the agent would have

Unexpected Oracle failures. These are
assumed to be data failures, and so a message
is logged to the Oracle database and reported
by the Host (see 5.2)

1 Purpose
This document contains ICL Pathway’s Resolution Plan in respect of Acceptance
Incident 378.

2 Summary

ICL Pathway distributed the fix to the original incident, of which there were five
occurrences, on 9-10 August. ICL Pathway is preparing an extension to this fix to
cover a similar incident.

3 Criteria

The Criterion under test is 831/1.

“The Contractor shall support interfaces from TMS and Outlets to Transaction
Information Processing TIP”.

4  POCL position
Based upon the minutes of the Acceptance Board Meeting of 18 August 1999, POCL,
contended that:

“rectification activity had not been successful and further analysis was awaited from
Pathway”.

5 ‘Pathway position

5.1 Further analysis from Pathway
The original incident that gave rise to AI 378 was diagnosed and a fix was distributed
to the counters on 9-10 August. There had been two occurrences.
A further three incidents were reported all relating to the period before 10 August.

A further incident with similar symptoms, but a different root cause (TIP 916) has
been reported and is being diagnosed and the system made robust against such
occurrences.

5.2 Resolution

ICL Pathway will continue to monitor for such incidents and fix them. The incidents
are tracked at the detailed level in 4/378 TIP Incident Status Report.

5.3. Clearance action

The clearance plan is to monitor the live system for any re-occurrence of such
incidents. The fix implemented on 9-10 August has been in monitored as successful
for over a month.

The fix for TIP 916 is in preparation and will be monitored for a period of two weeks
after implementation.

Analysis of Acceptance Incident (6)

IPOCL will be aware that ICL Pathway are changing the recovery processes of APS for CSR+. This includes
providing support for recovery of reversals. At CSR+ APS will automatically write recovery transactions for all
AP transactions. In the event of a Session failure these recovery transactions will be used to automatically recover
their original AP transaction.

In the event of a Disaster recovery at CSR +, the concept of gaps is removed. In this situation the message store is
being reinstated from a remote node and the recovery transactions are not available. APS simply asks the clerk for
details of any receipts which he has which have a date/time more recent than the latest known APS transaction
message. If the clerk chooses not to recover all receipts in this category then the clerk must retain these receipts
for later processing. The data entry process will also use check digits on each data item being entered from the
receipt.

Clearance Action (7)
Additional response 17/08/99.

In addition to the CSR+ facilities described above, the following change will be introduced into APS by the end of
INovember 1999.

Following a crash, and when undertaking Session recovery or Disaster recovery (i. for those transactions where a
system receipt has been produced), the user will still have the option of reserving a gap of transactions and
delaying recovery to a more convenient time. However should a second crash occur, the clerk will be forced to
undertake recovery of all those deferred transactions and then any other transactions that may have occurred as a
result of the second crash.

‘The recovery of transactions produced during fall back for which manual receipts are produced are not affected by
these changes.

IAdditional response 31/08/99.

This introduction of the above change to APS by the end of November 1999 has been agreed by POCL and this
Analysis Form documents that agreement in accordance with the action agreed at the Acceptance Workshop on
25/8/99.

1. Purpose

This document sets out the ICL Pathway Resolution Plan with respect to Acceptance
Incident 391.

2. Summary
This plan contains the actions agreed with Jeremy Folkes and Bob Booth (POCL) that

now constitute a satisfactory Resolution Plan for the issues raised under Acceptance
Incident 391.

3. Criteria

The Criteria under test are PS-22, PS-39, PS-40, PS-41, 698-03, 698-02, and 698-01.

[DN: PS39 is a repetition of 698-01; PS40 is a repetition of 698-02; PS41 is a
repetition of 698-03; PS22 is modified in the Codified Agreement to remove certain
references to DSS.]

4. POCL position

Several meetings have been held with POCL representatives and POCL have now
agreed that the actions in place to address the issues raised under AI 391 are
acceptable.

5. ICL Pathway position

5.1 Evidence to enable the plan to be agreed

5.1.1 Analysis of the Incident
POCL and ICL Pathway agreed that the specific areas of concern were as follows:

BOOTLE

1. The Data Centre fence is in a totally unsatisfactory state (acknowledged by
A&L)

2. There are no physical restrictions on pedestrian access up to within 2m of the

Data Centre, with the outer site fence claimed purely to be a delimiter and not
intended as a physical control.

3. Vehicle access is still possible to within 2 metres of the Data Centre. CCTV
coverage of the car park close to the Data Centre does not appear good, and
POCL have been denied permission to view the CCTV coverage. Pathway’s

previous stated mitigations to the proximity of the car park, based on CCTV
tracking, control of visitors cars, etc do not appear to be effective.

WIGAN

4. Access via a back gate was not restricted or covered by CCTV.

5. Expected CCTV improvement has not been implemented.

6. Site security is totally dependent on a single security guard / receptionist /

CCTV operator with no defined backup.

5.1.2 Resolution Plan
BOOTLE

1 Since the last POCL visit repairs to the data centre fence have been carried out.
Missing or broken tension wires and fixings, attaching the fencing to the concrete
posts and hooks to secure the fence to the ground have been replaced and the
locks on the emergency access gates are now secure.

2 The perimeter fence upgrade, installed to date and in progress will
substantially improve the security at the site. The likely A&L timetable for
completion of the third phase of the perimeter fence upgrade is deemed
unacceptable by Pathway. Therefore Pathway will install a new palisade fence, by
the end of November 1999, at 5 metres from the data centre that will be to the
same standard as the one installed outside the data centre at Wigan.

3 Changes will be made to the Alliance and Leicester Quality System security
procedures, specifically relating to visitors arriving in a vehicle. The content of
the changes have been agreed with POCL (J Folkes & B Booth) and A&L (B
Jones). The necessary entries in the A&L Quality System documentation will be
completed by 31/10/99.

WIGAN

4 Pathway will extend the A & L card access system, in line with corporate
standards, to the pedestrian access gate adjacent to the canal by the end of
November 1999.

5 a) An additional external camera covering the area between the data centre and
the perimeter will be installed by 30 September.

b) Pathway is currently considering options for adding a further exclusion zone
approximately 30 metres from the data centre. These options include motion
detection, a further palisade fence or a microwave fence. Pathway will make the
decision as to its preferred option by the end of September, for implementation by
the end of December 1999. POCL will be informed by Pathway as to which
option has been chosen. The local procedures will be updated to take into
account changes related to the new exclusion zone and Pathway will also add this
onto the RED CARE system when installed.

6 a) Pathway will produce instructions related to the Wigan Security Guards
response to alarms on their pager, for inclusion in the A&L standing instructions.
A&L have confirmed that they will incorporate these instructions in their
procedures by 31/10/99.

b) Pathway is adding the RED CARE monitoring system to the alarm trigger
mechanism on the palisade fence, by 30/09/99.

5.2 Resolution Plan summary

All Resolution Plan activities are now agreed with POCL and have been scheduled or
completed.

Pathway will provide site plans to POCL, by 30/09/99, for both Bootle and Wigan,
marked up to show where the additional security controls are/will be situated.

Ongoing monitoring of the plan will be carried out jointly and a POCL visit is
proposed to take place when all actions are complete (in late December or at the latest,
early in January 2000).

Introduction

This document has been produced following the POCL / ICL Pathway Acceptance
Board Meeting of 18/08/99 and addresses the comments made in the minutes of that
meeting with respect to Acceptance Incident 408 and the statements made in the
POCL paper 4/408 — HSH Service Level Failure ~ 24/08/99.

This document provides additional information and explanation to that contained in
HSH Scripting, SLA Recovery and Resource Plan - CS/SMM/AI408 - 17/08/99 issued
to POCL as input to the Acceptance Board.

This document has been updated in the light of the Acceptance Workshop of 26/08/99
and the Call Volume/HSH Model Workshop on 8 September.

This document has been updated in light of the Acceptance Workshop on 14
September.

2 Scope

The scope of this paper comprises the content of AI408, the contents of the above
paper CS/SMM/AI408, the topics contained in the draft minutes from the above
Acceptance Board meeting and the paper 4/408 — HSH Service Level Failure.

The topics can be summarised as: -
e Plan for production and implementation of additional HSH Cash Account scripts

e HSH Resource Plan, comprising call volume projections and HSH staffing
projections

e HSH SLA Rectification Plan

3 POCL position

Based upon the minutes of the Acceptance Board meeting of 18 August 1999, POCL
contended that:

"Production of scripts is not complete"

"Tt does not take account of activities such as the need to train staff"

"Some items have already missed dates"

"Call volume projections and staffing projections contain assumptions that POCL
cannot agree based on experience to date"

On 24/08/1999 POCL also provided the paper A/-408 - HSH Service level Failure.
This supplemented the above points as follows:

e POCL’s experience to date is that some scripts have resulted in inappropriate
advice resulting in further calls to HSH and the National Business Support Centre.

e POCL requires an explanation of how the call volume projections are produced
and the logic that supports this process.

e POCL requires that the SLA rectification plan is produced and agreed.

4 ICL Pathway position

Taking the three main topics within this AI, ICL Pathway's position can be
summarised as: -

e HSH scripting plan - The plan described in section 2 of ref. (1) remains the basis
for addressing this aspect of the Al. The Acceptance Board may not have been
aware that actions designated for the 17" and 18th August were completed on
time. Subsequent actions within ICL Pathway and POCL have been completed in
a timely and co-operative manner from all parties involved. The revised HSH
Cash Account script document was re submitted to POCL as Cash Account
Process - ICL/PW/DSP/PRO/023 - version 2.1 - 24/08/1999.

(At the Acceptance Workshop of 26/08/99, POCL advised that there were further
comments on the scripts and a joint POCL/Pathway workshop aimed at finalising
the scripts was planned for (and was held on) 02/09/99)

e HSH Resource Plan - Call Volume prediction

ICL Pathway wish to ensure that POCL has confidence in the modelling tools and
management processes that are used to manage the Horizon System Helpdesk in
terms of staffing levels. The development of the HSH resource model draws upon
a decade of market leading experience of ICL providing Help Desk Services to a
diverse range of Clients.

Some of the key assumptions were introduced in ref. (1) and to supplement this
ICL Pathway proposed that a workshop be held with POCL to address POCL’s
concerns. A set of objectives for this event was proposed in section 5.2. This
event was held 7-8/9.

The HSH has experienced a substantial increase in calls on Wednesday / Thursday
associated with outlets having difficulties in completing the Cash Account
process. This increase in business related calls was not predicted and it is ICL
Pathway's intention to establish a cash account domain of skilled staff with the
appropriate business knowledge dedicated to handling this increase.

ICL Pathway does not consider it appropriate for these complex business related
calls to be handled within the SLA constraints of the Level 1 / Level 2 call
definitions. These calls have distorted the SLA performance.

e SLA Rectification Plan

The actions and target dates that will contribute to an improvement in the HSH
SLAs are set out in section 5.3.

Future activities

Following agreement of the new scripts, and in conjunction with the establishment of
the cash account domain, these scripts came into operation from 08/09/99.

It was agreed that a joint ICL Pathway / POCL review be held on 14/09/99. The
objectives of the review held on 14/09/99 being:

« Review scripts in light of operational use.
e Review, agree and include any additional scripts
e To identify any learning opportunities

Such reviews will continue in line with the recommendation in
ICL/PW/DSP/PRO/023

5.2 HSH Resource Plan

5.2.1 Background

The development of the model to support the resource requirements of the HSH was
based on ICL's previous experience in providing a wide range of Help Desk services
covering both systems and infrastructure call types. This was supplemented by a set
of assumptions covering the particular call types that ICL Pathway believed would be
generated by POCL's outlets.

ICL Pathway successfully applied the call volume and HSH resource model during
the period of Release 1a through to Release 1c. During this period there was good
achievement against SLA targets.

During the period of LT1 it became clear that the actual call patterns diverged from
those predicted by the models. In particular there were significant differences in call
volumes following the introduction of the first Wednesday cash account.

Following the second and subsequent cash accounts the continuing high level of calls
on Wednesday / Thursday, which had not been predicted by the model, required that
remedial action should be taken.

The resources of the HSH were supplemented by expert assistance from POCL and
Peritas (now termed KnowledgePool) who were able to successfully handle the
complex business related aspects of these Cash Account calls. This had a beneficial
impact on the call response times for the remaining calls being handled by HSH staff.

5.2.3 HSH Staffing review

At the 08/09/99 workshop on the Call Volume/HSH model ICL Pathway shared with
POCL the most up-to-date HSH resource plans for the remainder of 1999. These
separately identified the staffing for cash account calls. The predicted staffing level, in
terms of Full Time Equivalents, is set out below.

5.2.4 Conclusions

5.2.4.1 HSH staffing levels

From its analysis ICL Pathway believes that the HSH is sufficiently resourced now to
meet the call volumes for Level 1 and Level 2 call types. Further resource is needed to
augment performance on cash account days.

5.2.4.2 Cash Account Domain

ICL Pathway has therefore established a domain of specialist staff with the business
skills to handle Cash Account related calls. The solution for service levels for Cash
Account calls was discussed at the workshop on 7/8 September and further
suggestions were tabled at the workshop on 14 September.

The scripts now employed have been agreed with POCL and are to be reviewed
regularly to ensure they remain as effective as possible. Since the navigation of the
scripts is dependant upon information provided by the postmaster and may involve
returning to the counter terminal to provide further tasks as instructed, the time
elapsed will vary (e.g. closeness to telephone, frequency of external interruptions,
ete.). It was agreed at the acceptance meeting that benchmarking of Cash Account
scripts would add little value in determining the service performance and that a
qualitative approach would adopted as follows:

1. 100% availability of helpdesk staff skilled in providing the appropriate advice and
guidance. That is, no postmaster will be told that they would be rung back on
initially logging a call at the HSH.

2. No repeat call(s) from the same postmaster for the same incident in the same
accounting period.

On 21 September it was further agreed that

3. POCL will attend the HSH to audit that the approved call scripts have been
followed conscientiously and that consistent advice has been given. The
performance measure is 95% conformance.

Pathway suggests that Customer satisfaction with the Help Desk service should be
determined quarterly as described in requirement 914. Pathway will be pleased to
assist POCL in devising and conducting the satisfaction survey.

POCL may assure themselves that Cash Account service calls have been correctly
coded by the HSH through their existing Internet access to Powerhelp. The problem
type ID, described in Appendix A, may be used to construct searches as required.

Should POCL wish to further understand Pathway’s processes for service level
measurement then Pathway would be willing to provide a two-day workshop on the
subject.

5.2.4.3 HSH Resource Planning workshop

In order to ensure that POCL share ICL Pathway’s confidence in the robustness and
flexibility of the tools and processes used in HSH Resource planning, ICL Pathway
has held a workshop with POCL to cover this topic in more detail.

The objectives of the event being: -

e To enable POCL to gain understanding and have confidence in the overall
philosophy of the call volume model and it’s relationship to the resource planning
model.

e To discuss and explain the factors and logic that apply to the modelling of call
types and call profiles

e To explain the iterative management processes that are supported by the model

e To review the impact of Cash Account related calls on service levels

Acceptance Incident 412 Date: 10/09/99

11

Purpose

This document is provided to resolve the questions and concerns expressed in AI 412
and to propose the basis of its Resolution. This AI relates to ICL Pathway’s
responsiveness in dealing with requests for ad-hoc reports, the method of calculation
used in the July Service Review Book and the ability of ICL Pathway to generate
counts of transaction volumes associated with SLA calculations.

The structure of this document follows these three areas of concern.

In addition the response to a particular ad-hoc report request referenced in the Al is
also addressed by this document.

Scope

The scope of this response comprises the original AI412, the supplementary POCL
paper AI412 - Service Performance Reporting and the minutes of the Acceptance
workshop of 09/09/99.

Summary

e Ad-Hoc Reporting - ICL Pathway accepts that the response to the particular ad-
hoc request referred to in this Al was delayed, but that the overall process is
operating correctly.

e July Service Review Book - The Transaction Time service level calculations are
based on the previously agreed mean benchmark transaction time. At this time no
adjustments were made for fallback transactions since the values for the various
catagories of fallback transaction time are still in the process of being agreed with
POCL.

e Transaction volume counting - ICL Pathway is able to count the various classes of
transactions and the overall transaction volumes are published via the ICL
Pathway Customer Services Web page.

Criteria

No criterion is mentioned in the AI.

POCL position

POCL's position is represented in the AI text as:

e ICL Pathway has not responded to an ad-hoc request issued on 22/07/99
associated with the July Service Review Book

© ICL Pathway has refused to respond to three previous ad-hoc requests

e ICL Pathway is unable to count transaction volumes

Acceptance Incident 412 Date: 10/09/99

e "if this data was not available it would not have been possible to report that they
had passed the service levels - this calls into question the veracity of their service
reporting.”

The actions arising from Acceptance Workshop (5) are:

1. POCL/ICL Pathway to meet to review particular examples (of ad-hoc reporting)
that are of concern to POCL

2. ICL Pathway to consider whether it would be appropriate to provide a targeted
teach-in to appropriate POCL experts to enable them to focus their ad-hoc requests
around Pathway data structures

3. ICL Pathway to provide further information on (the SLA reporting cycle) for
POCL to review.

5 Pathway position

The response to this Al is split into three areas to address the various concerns and
questions raised by POCL. In addition a Resolution Plan is provided in section 6 to
address outstanding activities.

5.1 Ad-Hoc Reporting

ICL Pathway accepts that there has been some delay in dealing with the ad-hoc
request of 22/7/99. POCL has since provided evidence that it was actually submitted
on 23/7/99 by email, but the intended ICL Pathway recipient did not receive it.
Section 2 of this AI response provides the response to this request.

The AI also states that ICL Pathway has refused to provide responses to three previous
ad-hoc requests. This is not the case and ICL Pathway believes that POCL were

The three requests are believed to be:

Ad-Hoc Request - History (Action Point 1)

The ad-hoc request process (CS/PRO/031 - MIS Report Production and Scheduling)
has been in operation for some considerable time, and the procedure for submission
was discussed and revised at the July Service Review forum. Many ad-hoc requests
have been and continue to be issued and ICL Pathway believes the responses provided
are to POCL's satisfaction. The following table summarises recent requests and ICL
Pathway's achievement against POCL's required response date.

Analysis of the above shows that responses were provided to POCL for eight out of
the nine requests, of which seven were within three days or the POCL required date.

The exceptions were the request of 10/06/99 whose response was delivered after four
calendar days, but three POCL Core Working Days, and the request of 23/07/99,

which was not received by ICL Pathway. The subsequent escalation activities were
not sufficient to recognise and resolve this.

Complete responses were provided to five requests and POCL were advised that three
requests could not be answered directly (see 5.1).

ICL Pathway will normally provide ad hoc reports in accordance with R914 within
three POCL Core Working Days where the information required is readily available in
the form sought. Where such information is not readily available, as in these cases,
ICL Pathway will agree with POCL the most appropriate way of addressing the
particular request.

5.1.2 Ad-Hoc Request - Request Definition (Action Point 2)

Analysis of Ad-Hoc Requests shows that it would be mutually beneficial if the style of
the request was structured in a form that more readily reflected the data sets available
to ICL Pathway and from which the response will be generated.

In order to assist in this process, ICL Pathway will provide a document to POCL by 31
October 1999, highlighting the structure of the data captured in the Data Warehouse,
the Riposte Message Store and other Databases (local to ICL Pathway Customer
Services / MSU).

This document is intended to assist POCL in identifying whether or not an intended
request for information, via the Ad-hoc query process can be readily met. (This does
obviously not prevent POCL submitting a request without reference to this document).

It is proposed that a joint workshop be held, prior to 31 October 199, between ICL
Pathway and POCL to discuss the POCL MIS requirements in detail. (This workshop
was originally scheduled for the end of August 1999 but was deferred by joint
agreement between R Brunskill and Jayne Widdowson (POCL BSM) due to
Acceptance activities.

5.1.3. Ad-Hoc Request - Process Improvement (supporting Action Point 1)

In order to improve the handling of Ad-hoc queries it is proposed that the following
changes are introduced to the receipt and delivery procedures for Ad-Hoc requests.

e ICL Pathway will arrange for an ‘Ad-hoc Query’ mailbox to be set up within MS
exchange. All members of the ICL Pathway CS / MSU will have access to this
mailbox.

e The ‘Out of Office’ return message will be utilised to advise POCL that a query
has been received into the mailbox (Wording to be agreed with POCL)

e The mailbox will be accessed on an hourly basis by ICL Pathway CS / MSU staff
who will, upon receipt of a new request, send an e-mail confirmation that the
request has been logged by one of the MSU team and will advise the following:

e The expected completion date of the query, or

e Ifthe query cannot be completed, the Ad-hoc request will be returned with full
details as to why we cannot supply the information

e The Ad-hoc query will then be logged into the Ad-hoc query database
e All replies to the originator will be electronic, using the fields within the Ad-hoc
query report.

e In order to complete this procedure correctly, the Ad-hoc query request will be
amended to include a field for the originator’s e-mail address.

e Ad-hoc query process document ref: CS/PRO/030, v1.0 21/10/97 “MIS Report
Despatch Procedure’ will be re-issued to describe this new procedure.

e Interim Arrangements - Until the MS mailbox is operational, Ad-hoc requests
should be sent, by e-mail, to both:

Kashmir.Purewal GRO. and Richard.Brunskill!

Service Review Book

The particular request mentioned in the AI, dated 23/07/99, requests:

"Transaction Services and transaction times for EPOSS, OBCS and APS for July
showing the underlying data / calculations used to show they passed these SLAs".

The calculation of transaction time service levels for OBCS, APS and EPOSS is
specified in Schedules H08, E08 and FO8 respectively. These in turn refer to the
Benchmark Counter Transaction Times documents CR/PRP/011, CR/PRP/013 and
CR/PRP/014 all at version 1 and agreed with POCL as Contract Controlled
Documents.

These documents state that, with the exception of OBCS foreign transactions, all other
transactions times are to be based on the set of benchmark figures contained in each
document and not based on actual transaction time measurement. In all cases the
weighted mean transaction time of these benchmark figures is within the target
transaction time (see 2.1) and accordingly the Service Review Book for July and
previous months will show this as achieved using a green entry against the various
Transaction Services.

Benchmark Transaction time summaries

The following is reproduced from the summaries of the above transaction time
documents.

Service Mean Benchmark Mean Maximum
transaction time transaction time

OBCS 26.02 secs 27.01 secs

APS 18.80 secs 20.27 secs

EPOSS 22.90 secs 23.13 secs

5.2.2 OBCS transaction times

In the case of OBCS foreign transactions, comprising 6% of the total OBCS
transactions, the variable element is the ISDN communications time. The measured
benchmark figure for this is 5.4 seconds.

The actual mean time for the last three months, and the corresponding actual mean
transaction times are: -

Month ISDN time Actual Mean Target Mean
Transaction time Transaction time

June 5.39 26.02 27.01

July 5.66 26.03 27.01

August 4.71 25.98 27.01

5.2.3 Fallback transactions

The service level calculations for all of the transaction types described in the Service
Level Schedules also have to be adjusted by the number of transactions conducted in
various forms of fallback. This will take place when the individual fallback
transaction time figures have been agreed with POCL and this activity is being
managed by Jan Ambrose (ICL Pathway) and Pavittar Sandhu (POCL). A proposal
from ICL Pathway was made on 3/8/99 and final comments are awaited from POCL.

When these figures are agreed and the relevant Contract Schedules updated, the SLA
calculations will then take account of any adjustments required for fallback.

At present, however, transaction volumes are not required in order to calculate the
transaction time SLAs because the values of the fallback transaction times have not
yet been agreed.

5.3 Transaction Volumes

POCL has expressed concerns over the ability of ICL Pathway to calculate transaction
volumes, particularly in the context of transaction time SLA calculations. The above
explanation covers why transaction volumes are not currently required.

The particular meeting referred to in the AI (9/7/99 - Liz Blackburn, Graham
Wingrove et al.) was not concerned with overall transaction counting, but with
particular aspects of EPOSS transaction aggregation.

Transaction volumes for APS, OBCS and EPOSS are provided as part of the vital
statistics information available on the ICL Pathway Customer Services Web page.

These overall totals are broken down into the transaction types required by the Service
Level Contract Schedules and will be used in future SLA calculations, subject to
agreement of the fallback times. Once this is in place POCL may request a detailed
breakdown of the transaction volumes that underpin entries in the Service Review
Book.

5.3.1 Service Level Reporting Cycle (Action Point 3)

In response to a request from POCL, ICL Pathway will provide a document by 31
October 1999 describing the data collection and SLA reporting cycle. It is intended
that the scope of this document will cover:

e What data is collected from the counters / helpdesks etc, and where it resides

e How this data is used in the calculation of SLA performance measures — the
interaction between Contract Administrator and the application of the formulas to
calculate SLA achievement.

e How this data is reported within the Service Level Agreement Monitor (SLAM)
and the outputs delivered to POCL.
