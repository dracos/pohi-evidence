Subject: Updates for individual MPs

Good morning Ron and lan,

I am so relieved to hear that things are beginning to run smoothly. Well done! It really is your persistence
and patience that has driven this, and James will be really pleased. He is away this week, but I'll tell him next
Monday. Welcome news and thanks for letting us know.

We have had two MPs contact James to ask how their constituent’s cases are progressing. I can’t be given
details about each case, but wonder if you can possibly let the individual MPs know direct? I am loath to do
this, as I don’t want to open the communication floodgates, but I can’t really see a way around it, as James
and I mustn’t be passed details of individual cases that do not belong to us.

Mark Lazarowicz MP —
Constituent is Philip Cowan

Priti Patel MP
Constituent is Graham Ward

I have let both know I will pass on this request.
Let me know if I can do anything,

Kind regards
Janet
