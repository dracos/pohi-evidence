2. This witness statement is made on behalf of Fujitsu to assist the Post Office Horizon

    IT Inquiry with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request provided to Fujitsu on 11

    March 2022 and a series of further questions provided to me by the Inquiry on 1 July

    2022 (Request), to the extent I have direct knowledge of such matters.

    have tried to remember these events to the best of my ability. However, given the

    time that has passed, my recollection of certain matters is limited.

18. Below I explain the changes that were made as a result of the Programme to the cash



   changes.




   key driver for the Programme was Post Office's business needs following a decision



   These drivers were explained by Stephen Hirst, Post Office's Finance Director/Chief

   Financial Officer and Sue Harding, Post Office's overall manager for the Programme,

   in initial meetings.




   that were required for Post Office to pay out the Giro cheques issued to benefits

                                                                                     WITN04790100




   relied in part on the footfall of these customers for its business.



   recipients, and would instead pay benefits directly into recipients bank accounts. The

   DWP had also decided to cease its practice of pre-paying Post Office the funds

   needed to pay benefits recipients. Instead, the DWP would allow Post Office to take

   out loans from the DWP on commercial terms and at commercial interest rates.

22.As a result of these decisions, there was a drive within Post Office to improve and

   implement changes to its cash flow management processes, to reduce the amount of



   Office.




   were broad and considerations for flexibility were included.



24.As a result of the Programme, one of the changes to the cash flow management

   process included Post Office providing benefits recipients with facilities to withdraw

   money out of their bank accounts at Post Office branches, to allow these customers

   to continue retrieving their benefits at Post Office. This change required Horizon to




   describe the impact that the switch to support network banking had upon Horizon.

                                                                                       WITN04790100




   achievability and risks of the tasks or changes that were brought about by the



   Fujitsu and Post Office concerning these matters at the time.

25.Another change involved Post Office encouraging local retailers to bank through Post

   Office, so that the overall money deposits would assist Post Office to offset cash

   required for withdrawals. It was understood that this would allow Post Office to locally

   recycle cash rather than having to source cash elsewhere, for example, through a

   I   IN




   replacement. Post Office documented other considerations that were relevant to the

   development of POL-FS in the POL-FS Conceptual Design, as summarised in section

   3 of the document and further defined in subsequent sections.

28. Consequently, another requirement that was identified as part of Post Office's

   business analysis was to develop a modern back-end accounting system.



29. It was explained to me that prior to the implementation of Horizon, Post Office's



   form') being manually produced (i.e. by hand) at the Post Office branch. This cash

                                                                                       WITN04790100




   offices in Chesterfield (Chesterfield) for the relevant reconciliation and accounting

   processes to take place.



   when Horizon was implemented. Horizon simply automated the production of Post

   Office's existing 'cash account form'. The format and information contained in the

   cash account produced by Horizon was not different from the previous cash account

   form. This cash account form was generated by Horizon and printed at the Post Office

   branch for the sub-postmaster to physically sign and send to Chesterfield.

31.As a result, Post Office received electronic transaction data via Horizon, while

   continuing its pre-existing processes of entering physical cash account data that was



32.Once received at Chesterfield, Post Office would reconcile the accounting data

   received via Horizon and the physically received cash account data. If Post Office

   identified discrepancies or other issues as part of the reconciliation process, it would

   issue changes and updates back to the relevant Post Office branch, which would take

   time to correct.

33.At the time that Horizon was implemented, I was not involved with Post Office Account

   and have no knowledge as to the reasons for the decisions that were made in relation



   processes were updated as a result of the Programme and subsequent development



   implemented at different times in accordance with Horizon software releases that

34.As a result of the Programme, the branch trading statement was developed as part

   of Horizon, as a replacement to the cash account form. One of the principal

   differences was that branch trading statements were no longer to be printed out and

   physically sent to Chesterfield, instead the data would be electronically sent to POL-

   FS. These processes are described in the Branch Trading Conceptual Design,



   postmasters performing the accounting process at their branch would receive a

   for confirming the branch trading statement, including the `Confirm Trading Statement

   'No'. It is my understanding that selecting the `negative' option (whether it was 'No' or

35. 1 am also aware that as a result of the Programme, the cash accounting period was

   changed from weekly to monthly. This change is noted in the Conceptual Design

   Documents. However, I cannot recall why the cash accounting period was changed.



36.As part of my work on the Programme, I can see that there were a number of

   requirements around suspense accounts documented in the Branch Trading

   Conceptual Design. It is likely that I had several detailed conversations about



   however as these conversations occurred 18 to 19 years ago, I cannot recall what

   was said or any actions that may have followed directly as a result of those

   conversations. Having reviewed the Conceptual Design Documents, however, I am

   reminded that the changes to be made to the usage of the local suspense account

   `Transaction Corrections', which were to be created centrally by Chesterfield staff in

   POL-FS, before being transferred to Horizon to be transacted in the Post Office

   branch. The 'Transaction Corrections' facility was implemented             to correct

   discrepancies in Post Office branch accounts in a more timely manner than the



   transmittance of physical 'Error Notice' documents or vouchers. It is also documented
