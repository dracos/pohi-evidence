Dear Greg

Post Office Ltd v Mr Lee Castleton
14 South Marine Drive, Bridlington YO15 3DB

Thank you for taking the time to meet on 30 August.

Following our discussion, I enclose a draft Witness Statement for your approval. I am in the process of
trying to obtain the Cash Accounts for the further weeks to insert the details into paragraph 7. I have
included some questions in bold italics. Please can you let me know the answers and make any
amendments to your statement that you consider are appropriate so that this accurately reflects the facts
that you related to me at our meeting.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely

Stephen Dilley
Solicitor
for and on behalf of Bond Pearce up tL
