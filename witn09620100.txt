Requesting Email). It was a discrete request asking RMG to search for
documents that related to the dismissal of the former postmistress at the
Cleverleys branch (Julie Wolstenholme) in late 2000, and the subsequent
litigation arising from it. It also indicated that POL’s understanding was that two
RMG lawyers (Mandy Talbot and Jim Cruise) had some involvement with the

matter.

6. | do note for completeness that, in addition to this request, we have received
and responded to numerous other previous requests for documents by POL
and solicitors acting for it: HSF; Peters & Peters LLP; and Womble Bond

14.RMG's retention policy is to retain material in accordance with a Retention
Schedule. When the relevant period of time for retention expires, the material
is reviewed by the relevant business unit. If they determine there is no reason
to retain the material, they refer the matter to RMG Legal and Compliance for
a final determination. If approved, destruction is carried out by the external

provider.

15. On 9 September 2020, a document preservation notice was sent to relevant
RMG personnel. This notice was in the form of an email. A copy has been

uploaded to the Inquiry’s document sharing platform (URN: RMG00000092).

16.The purpose of this email was to ascertain, following a request from POL,
whether any information or documents, relating to historic prosecutions of sub-
postmasters that relied on evidence from its Horizon system, were held by
relevant RMG staff. It asked two questions of investigators employed prior to

2012:

(i) Did you work on any investigations of sub-postmasters involving the use

of Horizon data; and

(ii) Do you possess any material relating to prosecutions using Horizon

data?

It also instructed them to retain any material until advised otherwise.

17.In relation to material held, two positive responses were received. One

investigator held material relating to two investigations involving Horizon data

). The former investigation did not result in a
prosecution and the latter investigation, which did result in a prosecution, was
not a case involving a sub-postmaster and an apparent cash shortfall (although

disclosure was made to the defendant's solicitor, on request, in January 2022).

18.A second investigator held material relating to 27 individuals (Modupe
Sunmonu, George Asamudu, John St Clair Willie, Frank Hester, Abdul Koyum,
Pratiksha Patel, Ashok Patel, Jacqueline Reid, Tina lyolo, Caroline Butler, Jerry
Hosi, Wendy Cousins, Anthony Gant, Valery James, Seema Misra, Solace
Agbleze, lan Warren, Alan Sales, Dawn O'Connell, Anish Kavi, Manisha Kavi,
Mahesh O’Dedra, Naveed Anwar, Saeed Anwar, Duranda Clarke, Jahira
Begum and Harendra Patel). This material was disclosed to Peters and Peters

LLP (solicitors for POL) in December 2020.

Please provide a copy of any RMG retention polices applicable at the time of
destruction.

19.Prior to September 2013, it appears that there was no consistent retention of
documents policy in place or that was followed and historically different

departments or regions would adopt different practices and procedures.

20.In September 2013, a group wide Records Retention Policy was introduced. A
copy has been uploaded to the Inquiry’s document sharing platform (URN:

RMG00000090).

21. In June 2020, the Records Retention Policy was replaced by the Data
Protection and Privacy Policy. A copy has been uploaded to the Inquiry’s

document sharing platform (URN: RMG00000091).

22.A copy of RMG’s Retention Schedule 2014 referred to in the Data Protection
and Privacy Policy/Records Retention Policy and applicable to material
destroyed between 2014 and 2021, has been uploaded to the Inquiry’s

document sharing platform (URN: RMG00000088).

Please provide a copy of any RMG retention polices applicable at the time of the

request received from POL.

23.RMG's current retention policy is contained in its Data Privacy Policy which was
introduced in June 2022. A copy of the Data Privacy Policy, which was
applicable at the time the request was received from POL, has been uploaded

to the Inquiry’s document sharing platform (URN: RMG00000087).

24.A copy of RMG'’s Retention Schedule 2021, referred to in the Data Privacy
Policy and which was applicable at the time the request was received from POL,
has been uploaded to the Inquiry’s document sharing platform (URN:

RMG00000089).

POL’S INTERIM DISCLOSURE STATEMENT - 78 RMG FILES

Please explain when, how and why RMG and/or POL identified the 78 ‘RMG Files’,
such explanation to take into account the context and background of previous steps
taken to identify, locate, secure and disclose materials in RMGs possession and
control and as relevant to Horizon. Please explicitly confirm when the RMG Files were

located, accessed, assessed and provided to POL.

25.We have responded to numerous requests from POL and their solicitors over a
number of years and have fully co-operated with them by conducting searches
for historic documents held in our archive; our company secretarial records; the
Postal Museum archive; and also files held by law firms instructed by RMG and

POL before the companies separated in 2012.

26.As part of undertaking its investigations for historic documents | understand
POL contacted law firms who had acted for it and RMG before the companies
separated and requested them to undertake searches for relevant documents.
As part of this process, Slaughter & May LLP (Slaughter & May) identified that
it held historic files that related to various commercial issues relating to Horizon
(such as renegotiation of the contract and intellectual property issues). My

understanding is that these files were provided to POL in or about April 2022.

27.In light of the above disclosure by Slaughter & May LLP, for the sake of
completeness, RMG undertook a further search on 23 August 2022 to

determine whether there was any similar material held in RMG’s archives. This

Page 9 of 11

Classified: RMG — Internal

was to proactively ensure that any historic commercial files held by RMG, which
may have fallen outside of the scope of previous specific requests made, would
be identified and made available to POL. The 78 disclosed files were the

product of that search.

28.The 78 files were received by RMG from the archive on 23 September 2022.
We undertook a preliminary review of the documents and determined they were

POL documents and that some of them would likely be relevant for the Inquiry.

29.On 11 November 2022 we notified HSF of the 78 files that we had identified.
The 78 files were sent by courier to HSF on 16 November 2022 and HSF

confirmed receipt on 18 November 2022.
