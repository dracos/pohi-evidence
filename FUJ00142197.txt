Subject: Incomplete summary issue

Gareth,

We have a problem with a branch where a single SC line was written for 100 Euros (£484) with no settlement.

This was in the middle of two RISP transactions and I suspect it's another oddity in the LFS counter code.

Initially it caused a harvester exception because some of the BlackBoxData info was missing, but that was corrected (so
has gone to POLMIS?) and now the set of transactions for the day don't net to zero, hence on the Incomplete Summaries
report.

I don't know what to do about it. As it stands, when they balance I think they will have a gain at the branch. If we correct
the POLFS feed so it nets to zero, it will not be in line with the branch, and will probably cause problems in future.

This might be a case for writing a corrective message at the counter but this has not been a popular approach in the past.
I could try talking to Gary Blackburn or Tony Jamasz?

Do you have any bright ideas?

This is rather elderly (26th Nov) - the Harvester exception call was not progressed very quickly.

Anne ___
