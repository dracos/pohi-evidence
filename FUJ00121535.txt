Dear Ms Helliwell,

to briefly summarise our discussion regard the letter from Fujitsu services:-

Horizon System Helpdesk.

| think this is a matter for the Post Office and Fujitsu rather than requiring any
comment from me, for the avoidance of doubt nothing contained within this section of
the letter alters my current opinion.

Transaction Handling on Reboot.

Whilst this section is helpful and assists my understanding of the process of
transaction handling it would not be proper of me to alter my opinion based on this
explanation, the supporting evidence of which has been destroyed. Should further
supporting evidence come to light, | am more that happy to consider it, if it is material
to either of the parties case.

Reasonableness of calls.

It has always been my expressed position that direct comparisons of calls to HSH
are required and your clients position that they have been destroyed, barring direct
comparison, and that I should give opinion on the surviving material that is available
to me.

Now it seems that your client has located data that they believe enables comparison.
Although the raw data has not been made available to me they say that it displays
that Cleveleys is ‘broadly comparable’. As | do not have the raw data | am unable to
say if my opinion is effected or not.

From the sample presented the mean for software issues is 20 although Cleveleys
had 35, for Network a mean of 1 against 5 from Cleveleys, Software 20 against 35
and hardware 4 against 6. So all of these issue factors are significantly higher for
Cleveleys than the respective mean which is inconsistent with the statement broadly
comparable when considering these measurements.

Although | must stress that no raw data has been presented so | am disadvantaged,
is it your clients intention to relied upon this data sample referred to in this letter?

Operator advice to 'Reboot'

The issue of further work being conducted behind the scenes has not yet been a
matter for expert determination, If you would like me to comment on this, again |
would be more that happy and would require the findings from the "crashdumps" as
referenced in the blue screen error messages which the second line support at the
HSH will have.

Defective Equipment
| am confident in my statement considering that this technology is a business tool

and the level of acceptance of flaws in operation is considerably lower than for
mainstream computing.

Worrying Discrepancies.

I'm unsure how this can be resolved as the documentation suggests the PM reported
discrepancies that seem to fall after a reported upgrade, without further information
this seems to be only resolvable by witnesses of fact.

In short to answer the question posed in your letter, No my opinion, currently,
remains as stated in my original note.

Best Regards,

Jason Coyne
