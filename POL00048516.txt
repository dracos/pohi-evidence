Dear Sir
REGINA v HUGHIE NOEL THOMAS

CAERNARFON CROWN COURT
PROCEEDS OF CRIME ~ 238° FEBRUARY 2007

Following conversation with Prosecuting Counsel I have spoken to Mr Matthews.
as a result of which I now enclose a copy of an E-Mail dated 22° February
together with a further statement prepared by Michael Francis Matthews dated
22" February. The E-Mail and statement have been forwarded by Mr Matthews
to Royal Mail's Agents Messrs Hill Dickinson, Solicitors. As far as I am aware the
Defence have not yet had sight of the statement.

I would be grateful if these papers can be placed before Mr Sion ap Mihangel
who holds the Brief in this matter.

Yours faithfully

Rob G Wilson
Team Leader
Criminal Law Division
