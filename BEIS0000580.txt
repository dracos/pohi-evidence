one or more of his shares upon payment for every certificate after the first of
such reasonable sum as the board may determine. Every certificate shall be
sealed with the seal and shall specify the number, class and distinguishing
numbers (if any) of the shares to which it relates and the amount or
respective amounts paid up thereon. The company shall not be bound to
issue more than one certificate for shares held jointly by several persons and
delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be a sufficient delivery to
all of them.

REPLACEMENT OF SHARE CERTIFICATES

If a share certificate is defaced, worn-out, lost or destroyed, it may be
renewed on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and payment

provisions of this article. The company’s lien on a share shall extend to any

notice has been given to the holder of the share or to the person entitled to it
in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the holder, demanding
payment and stating that if the notice is not complied with the shares may be
sold. To give effect to a sale, the board may authorise some person to
execute an instrument of transfer of the shares sold to, or in accordance with
the directions of, the purchaser. The title of the transferee to the shares shall

The net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs, shall be applied in
payment of so much of the sum for which the lien exists as is presently
payable, and any residue shall (upon surrender to the company for
cancellation of the certificate for the shares sold and subject to a like lien for
any moneys not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the
sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.

CALLS ON SHARES AND FORFEITURE

payment is to be made) pay to the company as required by the notice the
amount called on his shares. A call may be required to be paid by
instalments. A call may be revoked in whole or part and payment of a call
may be postponed in whole or part as the board may decide. A person upon
whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him
notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the shares in respect whereof the
call was made. A call shail be deemed to have been made at the time when
the resolution of the board authorising the call was passed.

LIABILITY OF JOINT HOLDERS

The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all
calls in respect thereof.

INTEREST DUE ON NON-PAYMENT

If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the person from
whom it is due and payable shall pay interest on the amount unpaid from the
day it became due and payable until it is paid at the rate fixed by the terms
of allotment of the share or in the notice of the call or, if no rate is fixed, at
the appropriate rate (as defined by the Act) but the board may waive
payment of the interest wholly or in part.

SUMS DUE ON ALLOTMENT TREATED AS CALLS

An amount payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date,
whether in respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a
call, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid the provisions of the

BEISO000580

23,

24,

25,

26.

27.

articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue
of a call.

POWER TO DIFFERENTIATE

Subject to the terms of allotment, the board may make arrangements on the
issue of shares for a difference between the holders in the amounts and
times of payment of calls on their shares.

If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the board may
give to the person from whom it is due not less than fourteen clear days’
notice requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any interest
which may have accrued. The notice shall name the place where payment is
to be made and shall state that if the notice is not complied with the shares
in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.

FORFEITURE FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH NOTICE

If the notice is not complied with any share in respect of which it was given
may, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited
by a resolution of the board and the forfeiture shall include all dividends or
other moneys payable in respect of the forfeited shares and not paid before
the forfeiture.

SALE OF FORFEITED SHARES

Subject to the provisions of the Act, a forfeited share may be sold,
re-allotted or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the
board determines either to the person who was before the forfeiture the
holder or to any other person and at any time before sale, re-allotment or
other disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the board
thinks fit. Where for the purposes of its disposal a forfeited share is to be
transferred to any person the board may authorise some person to execute
an instrument of transfer of the share to that person.

ARREARS TO BE PAID NOTWITHSTANDING FORFEITURE

A person any of whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a
member in respect of them and shall surrender to the company for
cancellation the certificate for the shares forfeited but shall remain liable to
the company for all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently
payable by him to the company in respect of those shares with interest at the
rate at which interest was payable on those moneys before the forfeiture or,
if no interest was so payable, at the appropriate rate (as defined in the Act)

the shares at the time of forfeiture or for any consideration received on their
disposal.

forfeited on a specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated
in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share and the
declaration shall (subject to the execution of an instrument of transfer if
necessary) constitute a good title to the share and the person to whom the
share is disposed of shall not be bound to see to the application of the
consideration, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any
irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture
or disposal of the share.

paid to a person of whom they do not approve and they may refuse to
register the transfer of a share on which the company has a lien or where

notice of a meeting by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not
invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.

POSTPONEMENT OF GENERAL MEETINGS

If the board, in its absolute discretion, considers that it is impractical or
unreasonable for any reason to hold a general meeting on the date or at the
time or place specified in the notice calling the general meeting, it may
postpone the general meeting to another date, time and place. When a

one member, that member or the proxy for that member or, where that
member is a corporation, its duly authorised representative shall be a
quorum at any general meeting of the company or of the holders of any
class of shares.

PROCEDURE IF QUORUM NOT PRESENT

If such a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed

chairman. If no director is willing to act as chairman, or if no director is
present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the
meeting, the members present and entitled to vote shall choose one of their
number to be chairman.

ORDERLY CONDUCT

The chairman shal] take such action as he thinks fit to promote the orderly

Each director shall be entitled to attend and speak at any general meeting of
the company and at any separate general meeting of the holders of any class

considers to be equipped by knowledge or experience of the company’s
business to assist in the deliberations of the meeting. In addition, the
chairman may invite any person who has been nominated for the purpose by
a member, where the chairman is satisfied that such time as the chairman
may determine, the member holds any shares in the company as such
person’s nominee, to attend and, if the chairman considers it appropriate, to
speak at any general meeting of the company.

ADJOURNMENTS

The chairman may, without seeking the consent of the meeting (whether or
not it has commenced or a quorum is present) adjourn any meeting from
time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at
an adjourned meeting other than business which might properly have been
transacted at the meeting had the adjournment not taken place. When a
meeting is adjourned for fourteen days or more, at least seven clear days’
notice shall be given specifying the time and place of the adjourned meeting
and the general nature of the business to be transacted. Otherwise it shall
not be necessary to give any such notice.

AMENDMENTS RULED OUT OF ORDER

or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder.

or against the resolution.

WITHDRAWAL OF DEMAND FOR POLL

The demand for a poll may, before the poll is taken, be withdrawn but only
with the consent of the chairman and a demand so withdrawn shall not be
taken to have invalidated the result of a show of hands declared before the
demand was made.

PROCEDURE IF POLL DEMANDED

A poll shall be taken as the chairman directs and he may appoint scrutineers
(who need not be members) and fix a time and place for declaring the result
of the poll. The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the
meeting at which the poll was demanded.

which it is to be taken are announced at the meeting at which it is

absence of his appointor to a separate vote on behalf of his appointor in
addition to his own vote.

QUORUM
The quorum for the transaction of the business of the board may be fixed by

be afterwards discovered that there was a defect in the appointment of any
director or member of a committee or person so acting or that any of them
were disqualified from holding office, or had vacated office, or were not
entitled to vote, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed
and was qualified and had continued to be a director or member of the
committee and had been entitled to vote.

RESOLUTION IN WRITING

A resolution in writing signed by all the directors entitled to receive notice
of a meeting of the board (if that number is sufficient to constitute a
quorum) or by all the members of a committee of directors shall be as valid
and effectual as if it had been passed at a board meeting or (as the case may
be) a committee of directors duly convened and held and may consist of
several documents in the like form each signed by one or more directors;
but a resolution signed by an alternate director need not also be signed by
his appointor and, if it is signed by a director who has appointed an alternate
director, it need not be signed by the alternate director in that capacity.

PARTICIPATION IN BOARD MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE

All or any of the members of the board or any committee of the board may
participate in a board meeting or that committee by means of a conference
telephone or any communication equipment which allows all persons
participating in the meeting to hear each other. A person so participating
shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting and shall be entitled
to vote or be counted in a quorum accordingly. Such a meeting shall be
deemed to take place where the largest group of those participating is
assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting
then is.

PERMITTED INTERESTS AND VOTING

(A) I Save as otherwise provided by the articles, a director shall not vote at
a meeting of the board or of a committee of directors on any
resolution concerning a matter in which he has, directly or indirectly,
an interest or duty which is material and which conflicts or may
conflict with the interests of the company unless his interest or duty
arises only because the case falls within one or more of the following
paragraphs -

(i) the resolution relates to the giving to him of a guarantee,
security, or indemnity in respect of money lent to, or an
obligation incurred by him for the benefit of, the company or
any of its subsidiaries; and/or

(ii) the resolution relates to the giving to a third party of a
guarantee, security, or indemnity in respect of an obligation of
the company or any of its subsidiaries for which the director
has assumed responsibility in whole or part and whether alone
os jointly with others under a guarantee or indemnity or by the
giving of security; and/or

(iii) his interest arises by virtue of his subscribing or agreeing to
subscribe for any shares, debentures or other securities of the
company or any of its subsidiaries, or by virtue of his being, or
intending to become, a participant in the underwriting or
sub-underwriting of an offer of any such shares, debentures, or
other securities by the company or any of its subsidiaries for
subscription, purchase or exchange; and/or

(iv) the resolution relates in any way to a retirement benefits
scheme which has been approved, or is conditional upon
approval, by the Board of Inland Revenue for taxation
purposes.

For the purposes of this article, an interest of a person who is, for any
purpose of the Act (excluding any statutory modification thereof not
in force when this article becomes binding on the company),
connected with a director shall be treated as an interest of the director
and, in relation to an alternate director, an interest of his appointor
shall be treated as an interest of the alternate director without
prejudice to any interest which the alternate director has otherwise.

A director shall not be counted in the quorum present at a meeting in
relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote.

The company may by ordinary resolution suspend or relax to any
extent, either generally or in respect of any particular matter, any
provision of the articles prohibiting a director from voting at a
meeting of the board or of a committee of directors.

Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment
of two or more directors to offices or employments with the company
or any body corporate in which the company is interested the
proposals may be divided and considered in relation to each director
separately and (provided he is not for another reason precluded from
voting) each of the directors concerned shall be entitled to vote and
be counted in the quorum in respect of each resolution except that
concerning his own appointment.

If a question arises at a meeting of the board or of a committee of
directors as to the right of a director to vote, the question may, before
the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the chairman of the
meeting and his ruling in relation to any director other than himself
shall be final and conclusive.

second director.

rights of the members, but no dividend shall exceed the amount

cent. of the company’s net profits after tax in such accounting period and

PAYMENT OF INTERIM AND FIXED DIVIDENDS BY BOARD

Subject to the provisions of the Act and the articles, the board may pay
interim dividends if it appears to it that they are justified by the profits of
the company available for distribution. If the share capital is divided into
different classes, the board may pay interim dividends on shares which
confer deferred or non-preferred rights with regard to dividend as well as on
shares which confer preferential rights with regard to dividend, but no
interim dividend shall be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred
rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrear. The
board may also pay at intervals settled by them any dividend payable at a
fixed rate if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution
justify the payment. Provided the directors act in good faith they shall not
incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any
loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim dividend on any
shares having deferred or non-preferred rights.

CALCULATION OF DIVIDENDS

Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to shares, all dividends
shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares
on which the dividend is paid. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid
proportionately to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or
portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid; but, if any
share is issued on terms provided that it shall rank for dividend as from a
particular date, that share shall rank for dividend accordingly.

DIVIDENDS NOT IN CASH

A general meeting declaring a dividend may, upon the recommendation of
the board, direct that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution
of assets and, where any difficulty arises in regard to the distribution, the
board may settle the same and in particular may issue fractional certificates
and fix the value for distribution of any assets and may determine that cash
shall be paid to any member upon the footing of the value so fixed in order
to adjust the rights of members and may vest any assets in trustees.

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS

Any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may be paid by
cheque sent by post to the registered address of the person entitled or, if two
or more persons are the holders of the share or are jointly entitled to it by
reason of the death or bankruptcy of the holder, to the registered address of
that one of those persons who is first named in the register of members or to
such person and to such address as the person or persons entitled may in
writing direct. Every cheque shall be made payable to the order of the

116.

117,

740203_2

person or persons entitled or to such other person as the person or persons
entitled may in writing direct and payment of the cheque shall be a good
discharge to the company. Any joint holder or other person jointly entitled
to a share as aforesaid may give receipts for any dividend or other moneys
payable in respect of the share.

NO INTEREST ON DIVIDENDS

No dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share shall bear
interest against the company unless otherwise provided by the rights
attached to the share.

AMOUNTS DUE ON SHARES MAY BE DEDUCTED FROM DIVIDENDS

The board may deduct from any dividend or other moneys payable to a
member by the company on or in respect of any shares all sums of money
(if any) presently payable by him to the company on account of calls or
otherwise in respect of shares of the company.

FORFEITURE OF UNCLAIMED DIVIDENDS

Any dividend which has remained unclaimed for twelve years from the date
when it became due for payment shall, if the directors so resolve, be
forfeited and cease to remain owing by the company.

ACCOUNTS
RECORDS TO BE KEPT

The board shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to show and
explain the company’s transactions, and such as to disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the company at that time, and
which accord with the Act.

INSPECTION OF RECORDS

No member shall (as such) have any right of inspecting any accounting
records or other book or document of the company except as conferred by
statute or authorised by the board or by ordinary resolution of the company.

CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS
POWER TO CAPITALISE RESERVES AND FUNDS

The board may with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the
company -

(A) _ subject as hereinafter provided, resolve to capitalise any undivided
profits of the company not required for paying any preferential
dividend (whether or not they are available for distribution) or any

sum standing to the credit of the company’s share premium account
or capital redemption reserve;

appropriate the sum resolved to be capitalised to the members who
would have been entitled to it if it were distributed by way of
dividend and in the same proportions and apply such sum on their
behalf either in or towards paying up the amounts, if any, for the time
being unpaid on any shares held by them respectively, or in paying
up in full unissued shares or debentures of the company of a nominal
amount equal to that sum, and allot the shares or debentures credited
as fully paid to those members, or as they may direct, in those
proportions, or partly in one way and partly in the other; but the share
premium account, the capital redemption reserve, and any profits
which are not available for distribution may, for the purposes of this
article, only be applied in paying up unissued shares to be allotted to
members credited as fully paid;

resolve that any shares so allotted to any member in respect of a
holding by him of any partly paid shares shall so long as such shares
remain partly paid rank for dividend only to the extent that the latter
shares rank for dividend;

make such provision by the issue of fractional certificates or by
payment in cash or otherwise as they determine in the case of shares
or debentures becoming distributable under this article in fractions;
and

authorise any person to enter on behalf of all the members concerned
into an agreement with the company providing for the allotment to
them respectively, credited as fully paid, of any shares or debentures
to which they are entitled upon such capitalisation, any agreement
made under such authority being binding on all such members.

RECORD DATES

RECORD DATES

Notwithstanding any other provision of these articles, but without prejudice
to the rights attached to any shares, the company or the directors may fix a
date as the record date by reference to which a dividend will be declared or
paid or a distribution, allotment or issue made, and that date may be before,
on or after the date on which the dividend, distribution, allotment or issue is
declared, paid or made. Where such a record date is fixed, references in
these articles to a holder of shares or member to whom a dividend is to be
paid or a distribution, allotment or issue is to be made shall be construed
accordingly.

SERVICE OF NOTICES

Subject to the articles, the company may give any notice to a member either
personally or by sending it by post in a prepaid envelope addressed to the
member at his registered address or by leaving it at that address. In the case
of joint holders of a share, all notices shall be given to the joint holder
whose name stands first in the register of members in respect of the joint
holding and notice so given shall be sufficient notice to all the joint holders.
A member whose registered address is not within the United Kingdom and
who gives to the company an address within the United Kingdom at which
notices may be given to him shall be entitled to have notices given to him at
that address, but otherwise no such member shall be entitled to receive any
notice from the company.

DEEMED RECEIPT OF NOTICE BY MEMBERS PRESENT AT MEETING

A member present, either in person or by proxy, at any meeting of the
company or of the holders of any class of shares in the company shall be
deemed to have received notice of the meeting and, where requisite, of the
purposes for which it was called.

SHAREHOLDERS BOUND BY NOTICE

in respect of that share which, before his name is entered in the register of
members, has been duly given to a person from whom he derives his title.

TIME OF SERVICE

Any notice or other document, if sent by the company by post, shall be
deemed to have been served or delivered twenty four hours after posting

consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member by sending or
delivering it, in any manner authorised by the articles for the giving of
notice to a member, addressed to them by name, or by the title of
representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt or by any like
description at the address, if any, within the United Kingdom supplied for

DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS OTHERWISE THAN IN CASH

If the company is wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of an
extraordinary resolution of the company and any other sanction required by
the Act, divide among the members in specie the whole or any part of the
assets of the company and may, for that purpose, value any assets and
determine how the division shall be carried out as between the members or
different classes of members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction,
vest the whole or any part of the assets in trustees upon such trusts for the
benefit of the members as he with the like sanction determines, but no
member shall be compelled to accept any assets upon which there is a
liability.

INDEMNITY
INDEMNITY OF OFFICERS

Subject to the provisions of the Act, the company may indemnify any
director or other officer against any liability and may purchase and maintain
for any director or other officer insurance against any liability. Subject to
those provisions, but without prejudice to any indemnity to which the
person concerned may otherwise be entitled, every director or other officer
of the company shall be indemnified out of the assets of the company
against any liability incurred by him as a director or other officer of the
company, in defending any proceedings (whether civil or criminal) in which
judgment is given in his favour or he is acquitted or in connection with any
application under the Act in which relief is granted to him by the court.

For the purposes of this article no person appointed or employed by the
company as an auditor is an officer of the company.
