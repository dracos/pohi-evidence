Purpose

This document sets out the ICL Pathway Resolution Plan with respect to Acceptance
Incident 391.

Summary

This plan contains the actions agreed with Jeremy Folkes and Bob Booth (POCL) that
now constitute a satisfactory Resolution Plan for the issues raised under Acceptance
Incident 391.

Criteria

The Criteria under test are PS-22, PS-39, PS-40, PS-41, 698-03, 698-02, and 698-01.
[DN: PS39 is a repetition of 698-01; PS40 is a repetition of 698-02; PS41 is a
repetition of 698-03; PS22 is modified in the Codified Agreement to remove certain
references to DSS.]

POCL position

Several meetings have been held with POCL representatives and POCL have now
agreed that the actions in place to address the issues raised under AI 391 are
acceptable.

ICL Pathway position

Evidence to enable the plan to be agreed

Analysis of the Incident
POCL and ICL Pathway agreed that the specific areas of concern were as follows:
BOOTLE

lL. The Data Centre fence is in a totally unsatisfactory state (acknowledged by
A&L)
2. There are no physical restrictions on pedestrian access up to within 2m of the

Data Centre, with the outer site fence claimed purely to be a delimiter and not
intended as a physical control.

3. Vehicle access is still possible to within 2 metres of the Data Centre. CCTV
coverage of the car park close to the Data Centre does not appear good, and
POCL have been denied permission to view the CCTV coverage. Pathway’s

previous stated mitigations to the proximity of the car park, based on CCTV
tracking, control of visitors cars, etc do not appear to be effective.

WIGAN

4. Access via a back gate was not restricted or covered by CCTV.
5. Expected CCTV improvement has not been implemented.
6. Site security is totally dependent on a single security guard / receptionist /

CCTV operator with no defined backup.

Resolution Plan
BOOTLE

1 Since the last POCL visit repairs to the data centre fence have been carried out.
Missing or broken tension wires and fixings, attaching the fencing to the concrete
posts and hooks to secure the fence to the ground have been replaced and the
locks on the emergency access gates are now secure.

2 The perimeter fence upgrade, installed to date and in progress will
substantially improve the security at the site. The likely A&L timetable for
completion of the third phase of the perimeter fence upgrade is deemed
unacceptable by Pathway. Therefore Pathway will install a new palisade fence, by
the end of November 1999, at 5 metres from the data centre that will be to the
same standard as the one installed outside the data centre at Wigan.

3 Changes will be made to the Alliance and Leicester Quality System security
procedures, specifically relating to visitors arriving in a vehicle. The content of
the changes have been agreed with POCL (J Folkes & B Booth) and A&L (B
Jones). The necessary entries in the A&L Quality System documentation will be
completed by 31/10/99.

WIGAN

4 Pathway will extend the A & L card access system, in line with corporate
standards, to the pedestrian access gate adjacent to the canal by the end of
November 1999.

5 a) An additional external camera covering the area between the data centre and
the perimeter will be installed by 30 September.

b) Pathway is currently considering options for adding a further exclusion zone
approximately 30 metres from the data centre. These options include motion
detection, a further palisade fence or a microwave fence. Pathway will make the
decision as to its preferred option by the end of September, for implementation by
the end of December 1999. POCL will be informed by Pathway as to which
option has been chosen. The local procedures will be updated to take into
account changes related to the new exclusion zone and Pathway will also add this
onto the RED CARE system when installed.

6 a) Pathway will produce instructions related to the Wigan Security Guards
response to alarms on their pager, for inclusion in the A&L standing instructions.
A&L have confirmed that they will incorporate these instructions in their
procedures by 31/10/99.

b) Pathway is adding the RED CARE monitoring system to the alarm trigger
mechanism on the palisade fence, by 30/09/99.

5.2Resolution Plan summary

All Resolution Plan activities are now agreed with POCL and have been scheduled or
completed.

Pathway will provide site plans to POCL, by 30/09/99, for both Bootle and Wigan,
marked up to show where the additional security controls are/will be situated.

Ongoing monitoring of the plan will be carried out jointly and a POCL visit is
proposed to take place when all actions are complete (in late December or at the latest,
early in January 2000).
