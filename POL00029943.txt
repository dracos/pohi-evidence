Christopher,

With reference to the outstanding Post Office action detailed in the below email, please find attached the
number and type of audits that have taken place, by year, since 2011.

In terms of the ‘random audits’ - any branch can be chosen, without any bias.
There are three main benefits of randomly selected audits: -

1. External auditors require assurance that systems are in place to validate that Post Office funds
exist at branches. As it is not practical to visit every branch every year, external auditors are
assured if a risk focused audit programme includes an element of random audits (so that no branch
in the Network is excluded from the possibility of being selected for audit)

2. To provide a baseline measure of risk e.g. If 5% of branches randomly selected for audit result in a
financial irregularity worthy of suspension/conduct code, it could be projected that the Business is
exposed to a risk of 5% of the entire c11760 branches (within a tolerance level). The higher the
number of the sample, the more reliable (statistically valid) the results

3. Enables a comparison against any risk model/branch profile e.g. if random audits show financial

irregularities in 5% of branches compared to 20% in audits generated by a risk model, it would
infer that the risk model is 4 times more effective than simply visiting branches at random. If a

POL00029943

randomly selected audit results in a financial irregularity being revealed, it enables a review of
where the branch appeared in the Branch Profile and, therefore, helps any risk model improve over
time.

T have left voicemails with Fujitsu, chasing their outstanding actions.

Regards

Mark

Christopher,

I have listed below the outstanding actions from the respective meetings last week against, broadly speaking, when we
expect to be able to provide the requested documentation / answer.

Let me know if I have missed anything.
e Fujitsu to:

- share its previously supplied comments on the Second Sight Reports (Monday / Tuesday);
detail the number of branches affected by the ‘Falkirk bug’ vs its ‘capability’ to affect, with reasons (Monday /
Tuesday);

- provide the number of system errors identified, by year, that could affect branch accounts together with the
number of branches that were affected and were capable of being affected by these errors, together with
reasons (Wednesday);

- _ investigate its email / data retention policy and how this would, if asked for the information, affect its ability to
provide the emails for those Fujitsu employees who worked at Bracknell in 2008/09 (Monday / Tuesday);
answer the questions posed in Jonathan’s letter of 16/12/2015 (the letter was forwarded on 17/12/2015. I will
call Fujitsu on Monday morning to obtain an ETA); and

- Comment on Page 6 of Deloitte’s Board Briefing Paper. I understand Fujitsu were approached and provided
comment at the time this paper was issued. We have requested this is shared with us (Monday / Tuesday).

© Post Office to:

- supply the Fujitsu presentation on the ‘forced log off’ issue (this is attached)
- the number and type of audits that have taken place over each of the last three years (Monday)
