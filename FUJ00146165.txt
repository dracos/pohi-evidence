KEL quoted is irrelevant - if the audit log had been checked, it would have
shown a different error message. The event was part of a storm which occurred
lover the estate that night as a result of a faulty software fix, and has
nothing to do with the discrepancies.

checks are ok. Cheques are being handled correctly (except for 10th Feb when
the clerk forgot to cut off the report - but this didn't cause a
\discrepancy). Cash declarations look ok, they usually use drawer id 11.
ccasionally they have used a different drawer id, this can lead to amounts
apparently doubling on the cash flow report, and should be avoided. But again
it will not cause a discrepancy.

checking the cash transactions on the system against the declarations shows
that they are not working particularly accurately (i.e. at the end of the day
the cash they declare in the drawer is tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds
lastray from what has been recorded on the system). It is possible that they
Jare not accurately recording all transactions on the system.

[there is no evidence whatsoever of any system problem. I've mentioned this
outlet to Julie Welsh (Customer Services) who will try to get POL to follow
lit up, but in the meantime please tell the PM that we have investigated and
the discrepancies are caused by the difference between the transactions they
nave recorded on the system and the cash they have declared, and are not
being caused by the software or hardware.
