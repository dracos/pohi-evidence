When I met with Kevin his concern was more broad - he is worried that because the issues at the branches get
raised and then closed that we're not seeing the bigger picture. And that we may have something systemic that
we can't see.

What sort of stats do we have on open and closed calls and length of time a call is open by priority.

Also is there any way / or do we have anything by branch on repetitive calls. Ie if a branch is calling every week
over a prolonged period which may not be the me issue?

Can you get Steve or Andy to look into what we have - purely from a FJ perspective.

Thx L

Ps I would like an early view of what the art of the possible is.

Many thanks for the update and good that progress is now being made. I’d like you to pick up with
Fujitsu to understand why we couldn’t have arrived at this conclusion sooner and therefore addressed
the issue without the need for an escalation.

Can you make sure that Kevin receives an update once the issue is fixed. Can you also make sure that we
(or Fujitsu) schedule a couple of follow up calls with the branch to ensure they remain happy with the
fix.

Regards,
Dave

Subject: UPDATE : Baughurst Post Office - Q17716556

Hi Dave

Fujitsu confirm that the engineer attended site Wednesday and believes he has
identified the issue.

The engineer believes the cause is the splitter cable at the back of the PHU (luggable
horizon kit). The PHU the site uses does not have a permanently fitted cable but one
which needs to be plugged in at each outreach site. Because they move from site to
sight the cable was not being plugged in far enough causing the purple screen.

The engineer recommended that the site be provided with a PHU which has a fixed
splitter cable. Fujitsu couriered a new PHU to site and has called the branch today who
confirm that the new PHU has been received. Fujitsu are now arranging for an engineer
to attend and set up the new PHU this could be next Monday 10 September 2012,
however we will not know for definite when engineer is going out until Monday as site
has just confirmed courier has delivered the new phu and current engineering
allocations have to be taken into account.

Fujitsu will contact us and the branch on Monday to confirm the engineer eta.

Kind regards
Emma

Hi Dave,

I’ve had a look into this in Rebecca’s absence.
I know she’s updated you verbally, so apologies if I’m duplicating anything that you already
know.

Fujitsu have arranged to a carry out a Preventative Maintenance visit to the branch on
Wednesday 5" September. I will call the branch to make sure that they are aware of this.
Fujitsu will have more information after this visit about whether the problems that the branch is
experiencing are due to something that the branch staff may be doing, or whether there is a
problem with the Horizon system that needs to be resolved.

The branch has now logged 12 calls about this issue since 1* June. The last call about this
was on 28" August.

Fujitsu are not aware of any other branches that are experiencing these problems.

If you need anything else, please let me know.

Thank you,

Can I have an update on this branch please? I think it was Rebecca that did the original investigation, but
I need an update as soon as possible today.
