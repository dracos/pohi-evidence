Executive Summary @ FUjiTsU

= Highlights
= All SLAs met for August. All power upgrades within Data Centres completed
= Journey to cloud proposition reviewed with Chris Broe, visiting both Belfast and Stevenage Data Centres

= Working with Deloittes on the Chairman's report to show all the controls are in place within Horizon to support the
prosecution service and KPMG on POLSAP/ Credence reporting reconciliation

= Service Delivery capabilities utilising GDC resources in Poland
= Lowlights
= None
™ Above and Beyond
= Working collaboratively with Atos in respect to the new Operational Change Board and framework process
= Provided manual workarounds to maintain service in the absence of WINZIP and CD drives in POL technology provision
= Issues

= Bad Debt, missing POs and working at risk issues improved now £902k, £555k and several CTs signed. But further work
required.

= Several expiring services now being extended. Need to review these as a group to manage impact.

= Anumber of service descriptions await sign off see appendix — still no updates received from POL

= Reference Data Open Loop risk remains

= ISAE3402: lack of ownership and therefore progression within POL following departure of Andy Jones

POL are planning to Exit POLSAP Apps before Hosting — Hosting extension past 31st March 17

Exit note for Application States Sth Oct 16 transfer date — POL request for reverse work shadowing being
negotiated

Credence/MDM Hosting being extended, 6 months current estimate with Option to terminate early
Fujitsu working closely with Back Office on POLSAP and Credence migrations to develop creative
solutions for the tight schedule

Service continuity remains a concern due to challenging schedules

Post Office have not determined the timing, scope or nature of network transition and Fujitsu is not
currently in Exit

Post Office have requested an extension of the BNS, CMT and OBC services past March 17
Authorisation to start the HNGX study has been granted, but the more critical BNS study remains
outstanding. This is a pre-requisite for the extensions noted above past March 17

Engagement to support the transition to a VSAT solution is ongoing

Working closely with Verizon to identify options for alternative Branch Network deployment options

ATP now signed and reengagement underway initially to revalidate the requirements

Initial assessment has been done of a standalone Windows 10 build and a significant issue around
printer drivers has been identified

Planning reengagement underway but significant dependencies remain with other suppliers (such as
requirements and designs) before a plan can be fully developed

Positive session on the full end to end Testing with Post Office and the other suppliers to rationalise
testing cycle

Issues and Risks @ FUjiTsU

= Transition

= Major Risk: POL transition plans complete BIP roll-out in October 2017. Fujitsu HNGX counter and BNS services end in March 17.
No solution has yet been agreed to address this gap. Action required now to maintain Branch service

= Anumber of extensions POLSAP hosting , Credence Extension, HNGX and potentially networks will drive extension or replacement
‘of legacy components and impact needs to be reviewed and agreed holistically. (In the Power down of the DR site a considerable
number of components failed on start-up, 9 disks, several blades and routers due to age.)

= Commercial, Quality & Compliance

= Outstanding Purchase Orders value of £555k plus 2° quarter cover for CT1848

= Unpaid invoices unresolved at £902km (June £868k, May £693k, April £682k)

= Patching continues to be deployed to Live service within target (90 days) of availability from 3" Parties
™ Outstanding CTs and CCNs

= Both Credence/MDM extension and exit POLSAP Apps Support CCN submitted

= 14. CTs where work done but commercials not signed . Progress made only 4 outstanding — Mediation and KPMG Deep Dive
‘Support need urgent resolution

= Service
= Reference Data open loop and historic items ~ Slow Progress
= Branch Network expires March 2017
= Forward schedule of change now completely full to end of year
= Detailed planning activities associated to planned failover of Branch Database 3/9
= Service Descriptions need sign off — no further updates since last set of discussions.
= End to End model

= Now that transition has commenced with EUC tower and Sl/Service Desk in place, Fujitsu are no longer responsible for end to end
model. Governance’ review is required. Example — pin pads being moved in branches, decommissioned PCs (counters) still on
network, security model etc
