Here are my thoughts — not proof read, so I apologise for the inevitable errors. I also apologise for the delay. With
more time it would have been better organised and shorter.

Best wishes,

Tony

Tony — any ETA on your comment on the LOR?

I'm sorry to chase. POL are pushing us to scope out how the next 2 weeks might look so that we can line up the right
people to review the LOR and it would be good to understand your thinking before we do anything.

Agreed on a short but polite response to Freeths.
Tomorrow lunchtime is fine for comments on the LOR.
The scheme provided no protection against "victimisation". Indeed, it said the opposite- that POL could use

anything found during the scheme to take action (eg. termination, civil proceedings, prosecution, etc) against a
postmaster. I'm really reluctant to give anything on this point but lets discuss next time we speak.

This is beyond a joke. They are running up costs for no good reason (or for no good reason that they have
identified). A courteous but firm response seems to me to be in order. Happy to discuss over the phone tomorrow
morning.

I’m conscious that I was supposed to let you have my headline comments on the draft letter of response by COB
today, and that I have failed to meet that deadline. You will have something by lunchtime tomorrow, but if that
causes you problems please tell me and I will get up early to accommodate you.

On your previous “victimisation” email, it seems to me that we could formulate a fair assurance that leaves our
ability to take lawful action in accordance with our ordinary practices. Given the terms of our April letter, I infer
that the complaint review and mediation scheme had some terms that might give us a good starting point. If there
are any terms relevant to victimisation, could you let me know what they are?

FYI — latest letter from Freeths on the GLO. They have asked us to identify now which of the GLO issues we consider
are not common or related issues, despite us saying that we will pick up this point in the Letter of Response (LOR).
I've attached our last letter for ease of reference.

I'll have a think about a response — are you around tomorrow to discuss?

Kind regards
Andy
