CORRECTIONS TO DEFENDANT'S WITNESS STATEMENTS

In the course of preparing for the Horizon Issues Trial, the Defendant has identified a number of
errors in its Witness Statements. The table below sets out the corrections required.

Johnson 1, paragraph 47.3 The reference to POL-0171713 should be POL-0444009

Johnson 1, paragraph 48.5 The reference to POL-0171713 should be POL-0444009

Smith 1, paragraph 16 This paragraph should read:

“Post Office introduced a case management system in
September 2018 that records each individual challenge to a
TC in-September-2048 raised via the NBSC helpline and, if
the FSC product team is currently working via case
management, passed directly to the FSC team for action.
Individual challenges to TCs were not recorded prior to this
and therefore it is not possible to state what proportion of
TCs have been challenged historically (or what proportion of
the challenges were successful) definitively. However, I
have spoken to various Team Leaders within the business
in order to gain a sense of proportion of TCs or Error
Notices that have been challenged in their departments
historically and what proportion of those challenges were

successful (i.e. preventing issue of a TC or leading to a
change in the TC before eventually being accepted or a
compensating TC being issued). The following sections of
this witness statement are based on information provided to
me by the Team Leaders identified in the headings or when
no Team Leader is identified from information within my
own knowledge."

An additional sentence at the end of the paragraph should
be added "However, page 2 of the Helen Rose report shows
that the reversal ‘was not an explicit reversal by the clerk"

Mather 1, paragraph 16 End of paragraph 16 continues

"because, I understand from my colleaque Tracy Middleton
that the branch confirmed that the bill had been paid for by
a Lloyds TSB cash withdrawal for £80.00 and that the
branch only gave the customer change of £3.91."

Bogerd 2, paragraph 30 complimented" should be "complemented"

"Mr Patny is correct that on 23 February 2016, he
processed a MoneyGram transaction for £3,100 and the
customer's debit card payment for the transaction was
declined by the customer's bank. At this point the
transaction was committed and could not be removed from
the stack, therefore Mr Patny had to settle to cash. Process
is that the MoneyGram transaction should have been
cancelled on Horizon followed by a reversal of the
transaction. The data shows that Mr Patny cancelled the
transaction, however did not complete the reversal. This
