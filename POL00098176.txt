Thx - you are right - has to be tomorrow.
That creates a diary problem. But I shall just have to pause my media training. Sorry Mark.
I will need good briefing Alwen. Can you arrange this? I only get one chance.

Thank you.

Paula please see email below before I go back to Janet, I think there are two options.
We could have a call tomorrow but you will not have all the pre mortem work finished
for stakeholders we could however take the time to talk about the high level best
outcome we can expect and get his viewpoint as to the way forward and the conclusion
including managing MPs and JFSP. I think this would be very helpful before he goes
away.

Or we can try and get a date in recess which seems a long time away.

What do you think?

Thanks

Subject: Meeting with James

Dear Alwen,

Thanks for your message. Just to let you know the situation from
here...

Alan Bates (JSFA) sent James a letter, and James has passed this
on to Second Sight for comment, letting Alan know that this is
what has been done. He is now waiting for Second Sight to
respond, and I shall nudge them today.

He is going abroad on Committee business this weekend, and
won't be back until 22 May, by which time it is Whitsun Recess
(21 May — 2 June). He may come in to London for a day, but
really won't be back until 3 June.

I wondered whether:
1. This might be done by phone this morning, or tomorrow
morning?
Or
2. Can you suggest a date and time as soon as possible
during the Recess period so I can ask James if he might

come in to London to see Paula? It would be good to try to
line this up today, if this is the solution.

Tam sorry to harry you, but I know this is important, and would
like to help all I can.

Kind regards
Janet
