Separation Project - Criminal Investigations Policy for Post Office® Ltd

Project Objective
To develop & record a process map for the role of criminal investigations policy

within POL post separation.

>» Process maps that have now been prepared are as follows:

Investigation related courses

Research, interpretation, preparation, development and publication of investigation procedures
Evaluation of criminal misconduct complaints and subsequent internal investigations

Forensic examination of computers for investigation/prosecution

Safe Systems of Work (SSoW) and near miss evaluation

Tape recording, playback and copying machines

Copying of CCTV tapes for investigation/prosecution

NOW WNP

>» The 2 areas below have been amalgamated onto a summary bullet point sheet;

1. Almanac - Annual entry in Police & Constabulary Almanac will need amending
2. Proceeds of Crime Act - Need to ensure that both RMG and POL are scheduled under POCA.

> The following area is under review within Section 5 of the Mails Distribution Agreement (‘Investigations
relating to POL Personnel’) ;

1. Operational Primacy - An MOU will need to be developed on operational primacy in given
situations, e.g. POL counter staff stealing RM special deliveries.

Those process maps prepared include a description of the task, the benefits to the business, (i.e. financial,
legal, compliance. H&S or otherwise). The process maps also include inputs (i.e. where does the info come
from, who do we need to liaise with, what forums do we attend, what organisations must we join) and
outputs, (what do we do with the info, who do we send it to, how do they use it etc).

Project Phases
e Program plan prepared.
¢ Focus Group formed (Graham Ward (Lead), Paul Southin, Dave Posnett, Helen Dickinson, Paul
Whitaker)
¢ Initial meeting with RMUK Investigation Team to identify RMUK, contacts, Policies and Baton Passing
requirements post separation.
¢ Format for Process maps agreed with POL stakeholders

The following pages detail the outputs.

P9 - Separation Project

A- Police Almanac & POL Listing as Non-Police Prosecuting Agency

Rationale
e Provides a listed point of contact for all security agencies to contact correct POL personnel
«Raises awareness of the POL Security Team throughout the industry
e Builds and develops relationships with external agencies

Liaison required with
Thomson Reuters (Producers of the Almanac) — Paul Southin already dealing via Chris Webb at Reuters

Outputs
¢ External enquiries directed to correct personnel

e Improved use of team resources
° More effective communication

Other potentially useful info
* The Police Almanac is supplied to all Police forces and other security agencies within the UK and is updated to
reflect changes in each new issue

B - Post Office Ltd scheduled independently under POCA

Rationale
© To enable Post Office Ltd to conduct full financial investigations and recoveries through the powers provided
by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 legislation
e POL can continue with it’s robust approach to the recovery of business losses as a result of crime

on required with
e Home Office (see e-mail below from Steve Guilbert dated 15t Aug ***) (Steve Guilbert - Postal Policy -
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills;
Will Gibson, Shareholder Executive
Tel “GRO I
*** As far as is concerned, we did clear the separation with Home Office and the modification Order to account
for the split and the naming of Royal Mail Group Limited and Post Office Limited will be made to allow for the

continued operations of POL.

Outputs
e Enable effective recovery of monies stolen from the business
e Expand the brief of the Financial Investigation Unit to conduct full intelligence enquiries
e Listed separately from RMUK under JARD (Paui Southin dealing with Geoff Hussey NPIA)

Other potentially useful info
@ = The separation from Royal Mail Group in relation to POCA has been agreed by the Home Office and a new
statutory instrument listed POL as a separate entity will be issued in the autumn.
