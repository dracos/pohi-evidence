POLB 13/126 UPDATE ON HORIZON

(a) The Board noted the progress report on Project Sparrow. The

Board discussed the number of cases submitted to the Working

Group for consideration, which were about twice those forecast,

and the effect this would have on timescales, resource and

possible compensation payments. Chris Aujard explained the

POL00021520

Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential

e the different risks crystallising; and
* additional resource costs to the Business of the increased

number of cases.
ACTION: (b) The Board asked for a regular update showing cases received,
Chris Aujard where they are in the process and the overall costs attached to the

claims where possible. This would be included in the CEO report.

(c) The Board discussed the past prosecutions and whether they
would be included in the mediation process. The CEO explained
that Sir Anthony Hooper, Chairman of the Working Group, had
originally thought this would be inappropriate, but was now inclined
to look at each case individually. The Board noted this and it was
pointed out that cases which had been through the Group would
almost certainly have to be handled differently from those which
had not.

(d) The Board discussed the approach to future prosecutions. Alasdair
Marnoch, Chairman of the ARC, reported that a paper on future
prosecutions had been discussed at the ARC but that no decision
had been taken. Chris Aujard explained that the Business had no
special prosecuting rights but brought cases in the way that any
individual could do. The CEO explained that prosecutions were not
brought lightly and the Business was reviewing its approach
alongside other deterrents, such as suspending, or giving notice, to
a sub-postmaster.

(e) The Board was reminded of the detail of the four cases in the

ACTION: significant litigations noting paper and the need to continue to
Chris Aujard/ prosecute when appropriate. The Board agreed that it would be
Angela V-D- Bogerd appropriate to consider the future approach to prosecutions at a

future Board alongside the improved support processes for sub-
postmasters which should see a reduction in cases.

ACTON: (f) The Board asked for a note from the General Counsel explaining

Chris Aujard who was named in past prosecutions and the liability for the
Business and individual Board members. The note should also
include information on both PI and D&O insurance cover.

(9g) The Board noted the progress report on Horizon.
(h) Chris Aujard and Belinda Crowe left the meeting

(b) Alasdair Marnoch explained that Ernst & Young, the External
Auditors had been at the meeting and that after their input the ARC

in total. The Board supported the approach but encouraged the
Business to push forward with pace to get actions in place to
mitigate these risks.

(d) The Board questioned the risk highlighted as ‘tisk of regulatory or
reputational damage from FS mis-selling’ and asked the Business
ACTION: Chris to consider renaming it as the ‘tisk of delivering poor customer

on what actions were currently in place to mitigate this risk. The
CEO explained that The Business was currently undergoing a FCA

visit looking at Mortgage selling.

Transformation programmes.

been circulated to the Board and explained that the mix of products
sold in the first locals had been different to that expected from the
modelling, with less of an emphasis on premium mails. This had
affected the income being generated, and although other products
had made up the majority of the shortfall, it was a position which
the Business believed it could rectify through modifying the training
provided. The new training would be in place from January.

different, the cost savings to the Business from the introduction of
‘locals’ remained on track.
