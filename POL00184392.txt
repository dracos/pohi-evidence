FYI. Helpful as long as George's answer is carefully worded. Ie., important that he is not seen to be in our
pocket on it. Which he isn't as this is the Fed's view. I will mention to him. P

Dear Mr Thompson,

So close to Christmas and with delays in the mail, I have attached a pdf of a letter to you
which is self-explanatory about a forthcoming investigation into the Post Office Horizon
system which I believe will benefit your members. If you so wish, it could be published in

the Subpostmaster Magazine.

Once January arrives there will be significant press coverage about this investigation in
POL00184392
POL00184392

order to ensure the widest possible audience is reached.
If you have any questions about this please do not hesitate to contact me.
