1. Introduction

The Post Office Ltd Major Incident Management process is owned and managed
by the Live Service & Business Continuity Team within Service Delivery.

Incidents impacting PO Ltd are managed using a three level management
structure. The involvement of each level is influenced by the severity of the
incident.

2. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define:

e roles and responsibilities in managing an incident and the methods by which
management will be notified that a] an incident has occurred and b] that their
involvement will be required

e the types of incidents likely to result in the invocation of Major Incident
Management procedure

e the procedures that will be used by Post Office Ltd [POL] should a major
incident oceur.

3. Roles and Responsibilities

There are three levels of management within PO Ltd who may be called upon to
participate in the management of an incident, as follows:

Level 1 - PO Ltd Live Service team [Service Delivery]

All incidents and problems impacting live service within PO Ltd are reported
into, controlled by and managed within this team. If appropriate, this team will
communicate to the PO Ltd Business Protection Team and the Major Incident
Escalation Group to inform them of an incident and/or to request their input.
Appendix A includes the Service Delivery contacts.

Level 2 - PO Ltd Business Protection Team [Business wide working group]
This team consists of empowered business representatives from across PO Ltd.
These business area ‘experts’ are available at all times and will be used to

4. Major Incident Definition

‘An incident that has an immediate and/or potentially prolonged adverse impact
on one, some or all of the following: PO Ltd Branches, POL employees ,
customers, clients or PO Ltd brand image’.

It is difficult to precisely define a Major Incident due to the number of variables
that have to be considered as part of the impact assessment when an incident
occurs. Such factors include time of day, business climate, day of week and time
of year. Figure 2 provides a summary of these variables plus the components
that combine to deliver key PO Ltd services. A failure in any of these could
impact live service leading to a major incident.

Major IT suppliers to PO Ltd — Fujitsu Services, EDS and CSC - are currently
re-defining major incident trigger points. These will be included in future
versions of this document to further assist in Major Incident definition.

For simplicity, incidents are classified into three impact levels: High, Medium
and Low.

« High —an incident that has occurred with a significant and potentially
prolonged adverse impact on PO Ltd. Typically these incidents will
initially require a significant amount of reactive management before they
can then be controlled and resolved.

« Medium — an incident which has the potential to impact PO Ltd but which
can be controlled and mitigated against through effective management

« Low ~—an incident that requires business attention but which if managed
effectively will not have significant impact on PO Ltd.

To provide further guidance, a number of scenarios together with the resulting
business impact are now defined. The level of management input is also
clarified.

Scenario 1 Central London transport network security alert.

A major security alert on the tube network could during core business hours
could have an immediate impact on our people in Administration sites, branches
and the Supply Chain operation. Depending on the scale of the incident, there
could be post office branch closures, disruption to transport routes, exclusion
zones, and difficulties getting to and from work.

Conclusion: High Impact
Management Involvement: MIEG [Level 3]

Scenario 2 Electronic Benefits Transfer system failure during core business
hours on a Monday.

EBT is the core banking sub-system provided by JP Morgan Electronic
Financial Services Inc., which sits within the overall post office card account
system infrastructure provided to Post Office Ltd by EDS. The EBT system
authorises post office card account withdrawals and holds core data for the post
office card account.

POL00001538

Version 0.38 Ref, Number CON/MGM/006

A failure of the EBT system, or an issue that required EBT to be taken offline
during core business hours would have an immediate high profile business
impact across the whole network because post office branches would not be able
to perform card account transactions — one of the key product areas. This failure
would have political sensitivity and potentially long recovery times.

Conclusion: High Impact
Management involvement: MIEG [Level 3]

Scenario 3. Industrial Action in Supply Chain.

Industrial Action within Supply Chain would impact on the ability of Post
Office Ltd to maintain the delivery and collection of cash to, potentially, all post
office branches. This could impact on all key product areas.

Conclusion: High Impact
Management involvement: MIEG [Level 3]

Scenario 4. Broadband Access Server Failure.

A Broadband Access Server [BAS] router is a component of the Fujitsu Services
managed service supporting on-line services at Asymmetric Digital Subscriber
Line [ADSL] connected post office branches.

A failure of a BAS router during core business hours would result in an on-line
service failure to all branches attached to the failed BAS router for between one
and two hours. This would typically impact between one and three hundred post
office branches in a dispersed geographical area.

Conclusion: Medium Impact
Management involvement: LST and BPG [Levels I and 2]

Scenario 5. Automated Payment File Transfer Failure.

Automated Payment files detail payments made by customers at post office
branches. The files are delivered overnight to clients by Fujitsu Services.

A failure in the delivery of the file[s] would have some impact on customers,
post office branches and helplines, as clients will not have received details of AP
payments made by customers at post office branches the previous working day.
This impact would be relatively low.

There may also be financial penalties if POL are non-compliant to service
delivery timescales.

Conclusion: Low / Medium Impact
Management involvement: LST and BPG [Levels I and 2]

Scenario 6. Generator Failure at Future Walk, Chesterfield.

A failure of the generator at Future Walk would have no immediate business
impact.

There would be a loss of resilience in the event of a power failure scenario at
Future Walk.

Conclusion: Low Impact
Management involvement: LST [Level 1]

Scenario 7. Payment Card Data Compromise at Data Centre.

Payment Card data (or Cardholder data) may include the 16 digit card account
number, account name, expiry date, security code(s), amongst other information
which may be stored on a payment card.

A suspected compromise of this data at a data centre will invoke certain
obligations on POL under existing contracts with the Merchant Acquirer(s).
Foremost is an investigation that which must include a complete forensic
examination of all potentially affected systems and processes. This
investigation is mandatory on POL. In order to complete their investigation the
Forensic Examiners (FE) may require that the data centre be disconnected from
all external networks and that affected systems be disconnected from all
adjacent systems.

The investigation would also require a forensic copy be made of relevant data
(process data, logs and audit records).

The affected data centre might not be reconnected until the investigation is
complete which may take several weeks.

There may also be significant financial penalties if POL are non-compliant to
the Card Schemes security standard (PCI DSS) and/or if Cardholder data is
found to be compromised.

Conclusion: High Impact
Management involvement: MIEG [Level 3]

5. Major Incident Management process

In the event of a major incident, activities must be co-ordinated within the
business in order to minimise adverse impact and protect service to both
customers and clients.

The PO Ltd Live Service Team within Service Delivery is always the co-
ordination point for this activity.

Depending on the severity of the incident, the PO Ltd Live Service Team will
require the support of all or selected members of the POL Business Protection
Team and/or the Major Incident Escalation Group to assist in the management of
a major incident.

The process map at Figure I illustrates the sequence of events that take place
when an incident occurs. Also illustrated at Figure I is the problem management
process, which manages problems, which do not [or which no longer] require
continual wider business involvement. The problem management process is
owned and managed by the Service Improvement Teams in Service Delivery.

Figure I should be read in conjunction with the steps in the table on page 13.

In the case of a PCI Incident the initial steps will follow the process found in
POL/HNG/PLA/001. That process will intersect at box 3 in the table on page 13.
Note that the PCI Incident process contains additional requirements not found in
this process and must therefore be used in parallel with this process.

Please note: where the process refers to the ‘Working Group’, this is made up
of all or specified members of the POL Business Protection Team, as selected by
the PO Ltd Live Service Team depending on the nature of the incident.

Testing the Major Incident Management Process

Testing of the Major Incident Management process will be undertaken quarterly
in two formats:

e A workshop scenario test.
And

e A Business Protection Team member’s availability test.

Workshop Scenario Test

The workshop scenario test will include members of the Business Protection
Team, the MIEG [Board of Directors] and the Service Delivery Live Service
Team . At the workshop a scenario in the form of a major incident with
significant business impact will be worked through. Test members will be
allocated a role such as key supplier.

The objective of the test will be to validate the documented processes and
procedures by which Major Incidents are managed within Post Office Ltd.

Availability Test

The Business Protection Team availability test will take the form of a text
message sent to Business Protection Team members’ business mobile phones.
The text message will request a response within a requested timescale to the
Service Delivery Business Continuity Team.

The objective of the availability test will be to test the ability of Business
Protection Team members to respond quickly in the event of a Major Incident.

Appendix B ~ Business Protection Team responsibilities

The Post Office Ltd Business Protection Team is made up of empowered
representatives from key areas throughout the business. See the table at
Appendix A for details of the current Business Protection Team membership
and additional useful contact points.

Responsibilities of members:

a) Be available and contactable on a 24x7 basis — business mobiles should
be left switched on at all times except when on annual leave. They may be
muted if required preferably on ‘vibrate’ mode as a minimum, but
text/voicemail messages from the Live Service Team must be acted upon.
These will appear in your message in box as being from ‘DutyManager’.

b) Be the single contact point and co-ordinate all activities within your
directorate/function.

c) Be responsible for making decisions on behalf of the business, and taking
actions to quickly manage the adverse impacts of a major service incident.

d) Facilitate two-way communications between your directorate/function and
the appointed working group— ensuring that where the incident impacts
your directorate/function you have kept all interested parties within your
directorate informed and continue to keep them informed on the progress
of the incident through to resolution.

e) Ensure that members of the Live Service Team are informed/notified
about any events in your area, which may lead to a major service incident.

f) Consider any communications that may be required following the post
major incident review, and be instrumental in their delivery, if appropriate
to your directorate/function . For example, giving recognition if
appropriate, sending out control reminders, etc.

g) Participate in periodic business continuity tests of the Major Incident
Management procedures.

Responsibilities in the event of being assigned to the appointed Business
Protection working group for a major incident:

a) Ensure consistent attendance throughout a major incident to ensure
progress is not hindered. You should therefore make every conceivable
effort to attend any meeting and/or conference call arranged. This may

mean that pre-booked appointments have to be rescheduled.

b) Complete all actions assigned to you within the agreed timescales.

c) Wherever possible, take a second person to the working group meetings /
conference calls. This will allow people to leave the meeting to seek
additional information [if it is required during the meeting], without
losing input from the directorate/function, or delaying the activities of the
working group.

d) Participate in a post major incident review.

e) Consider any communications that may be required following the review,
and be instrumental in their delivery, if appropriate to your
directorate/function . For example, giving recognition if appropriate,

Appendix I — Telephone Conference Call Etiquette

In order for telephone conferences to run professionally the following etiquette is to be
followed.

¢ The chairperson will set up and enter the conference call at least five minutes before its
advertised start time and then start the conference call within five minutes of the advertised
start time.

e The conference call should be treated like any other meeting.

© Ifyou can not attend the conference call then please let the chair know before the
advertised start time , if possible.

e The conference call will aim to last no longer than 45 minutes.

© If possible arrange to be in a quiet room, away from the office or other disturbances to
participate in the connference call.

e Upon joining the conference call the participant must state their full name and the
directorate/team that they are representing.

e The chairperson will identify them self , host the call and set the scene/state the reason for
the conference call.

e A roll call will be undertaken prior to the conference call starting by the note taker who
will issue actions etc after the conference call to all participants.

e When participants are not speaking then they must mute their telephone handset —
Participants can mute their line by pressing * then 6 to cut out any background noise when
this is present. They can then unmute their line by pressing * then 6. This will reduce
background noise on the conference call.

¢ Ifyou are joining a conference call using your mobile phone, check beforehand that you
will be in a good signal reception area

¢ Be sure to keep your mobile phone a few feet away from your landline telephone handset
as it can create a ‘hum' when active.

e Take care not to rustle paper, type or make a noise that might disturb the call, unless your
line is muted.

© Prior to speaking on the call the participant must state their full name.

e All participants on the call must observe common curtsey to other participants when they
are speaking.

© At the end of the conference call, the chair will summarise the key actions and agree the
next meeting date and time ,if relevant & thank everyone for their attendance and
participation.

e The objective of the conference call is to resolve/manage the MBCI to a satisfactory
conclusion.

Introduction

While the POL Major Incident Management process is owned and managed by
the Business Continuity Team within Operations Control the PCI aspect is
owned by Information Security but manages and escalates a PCI incident as far
as possible using processes already established within POL and RMG.

A PCI Incident may impact POL in a number of ways. Minor incidents will be
handled using established processes within and across POL and RMG Security
teams.

A Major PCI Incident will require escalation to and management by the
Operation Control Major Incident Management Process as defined in document
CON/MGM/006.

This document derives from RMG Information Security Incident Response

Policy (S15)

Purpose

The purpose of this document is as follows:

e To define a PCI Incident

e To specify how a PCI Incident should be categorised.

e To define the roles and responsibilities in managing a PCI Incident at its
various stages and the methods by which management will be notified and
informed of an incident

e To outline the forensic response to a Major PCI Incident

e To define why and when a Major PCI Incident may necessitate the elective
invocation of a Major Business Continuity Incident at the HNGX Data
Centres

e To identify reporting requirements

e To identify test requirements and propose test scenarios

Scope

This document applies to POL HNGX programme after it goes live.

This document only applies in respect of the contract between POL and
Streamline. It does not apply to any other payment card service used by or for
POL.

This document does not apply to suppliers other than Fujitsu Services Ltd Post
Office Account.

This document does not apply to any Web Portal.
PCI Incident Definition

A PCI Incident is one where information is received that indicates that
cardholder data may have been compromised. It is not necessary to demonstrate
that cardholder data has been compromised to declare an incident. Part of the

F/521/43
POL00001538
POL00001538

PCI Incident Response Plan will be an investigation to confirm whether a
compromise has or has not taken place.
PCI Incidents are defined as Minor or Major.

Minor PCI Incident Definition
The definition of a Minor PCI Incident is not an exact science and will involve
the judgement of the POL Security Incident Manager. Such an incident will
typically appear to be the work of opportunist theft not organised crime.
Such an incident is one where, for example:
a) Up to 1,000 cardholder details are suspected of being compromised
over a period of 12 months or more in four or more locations, AND
b) It can be shown conclusively that a HNGX Data Centre cannot have
been involved in the compromise

Major PCI Incident Definition

The definition of a Major PCI Incident while not an exact science requires less
judgement but must involve the judgement of the POL Security Incident
Manager and the POL Head of Information Security. Such an incident will
appear to be an organised activity to obtain credit or debit card details and will
necessarily imply large scale compromise of data. Regardless of the volumes of
data involved an incident will be categorised Major if any HNGX Data Centre
appears to be involved. The determination that an HNGX Data Centre is
involved will depend on an interpretation of the evidence obtained of the
suspected compromise.

Thus a Major PCI Incident is one where, for example:

a) asingle large volume compromise appears to have occurred e.g. more
than 1,000 cardholder details over a period of no more than one week
in four or less locations, OR

b) _ the evidence indicates that payment card data compromised could
only have come from POL systems.

PCI Incident Management

This section describes the entry points to the PCI Incident Management Process
and the decision points leading to a Minor Incident declaration or a Major
Incident declaration.

The process is shown in Figure I on page 51. and described in Table I on page
52.

Initial Reporting
An Initial Report is one made by any POL team receiving an allegation from any

F/521/44
POL00001538
POL00001538

source that payment card data may have been compromised while in the
possession of POL.

Sources include (but are not limited to): Business Partners, Suppliers or External
Agencies, Customers or Users.

It is also possible that the Merchant Acquirer may be the source. This may occur
if POL has been identified as a Common Point of Purchase (CPP).

An Initial Report is the first indication received of the possible compromise of
cardholder data whilst in the POL environment (counters, business processes,
data centre networks, systems, suppliers etc).

Each POL team that may be expected to make an Initial Report must ensure they
know what information must be obtained from the source. See Section 0 and 0.

Escalation Path

The Initial Report must be passed to the first person in the list below. That
person must respond with a positive written confirmation that the Initial Report
has been received and that they are dealing with it.

If no such response is received within 24 hours then the Initial Report must be
passed to the next person on the list in exactly the same manner and each time
allowing 24 hours for a response.

Severity Analysis

The POL Security Incident Manager will obtain, confirm and review the
evidence of the incident if it is not provided with the Initial Report. It is
presumed that such evidence will be a copy of the cardholder data that is
purported to have been compromised. The content and format of the cardholder
data can point to how the incident may have taken place.

If no evidence exists then the incident is closed.

The Severity Analysis will be entered into the Incident Report.

PCI Incident Reports

The POL Security Incident Manager is responsible for completing a PCI
Incident Report according to the format described in Section 0

PCI Minor Incidents Reports must be passed to the POL Head of Information

F/521/45
POL00001538
POL00001538

Security on a monthly basis.
PCI Major Incident Reports must be passed to the POL Head of Information
Security within 5 minutes.

PCI Incident Classification
The POL Security Incident Manager must review the evidence and classify the
incident as Minor or Major. See Section 0.

PCI Minor Incident Declaration

Based on the evidence received the POL Security Incident Manager may declare
an incident a PCI Minor Incident and will pass the investigation of the incident
to the relevant security team within POL or RMG.

The POL Security Incident Manager will also pass a copy of the PCI Incident
Report to the Head of Product and Branch Accounting in the Finance
Department so that the Merchant Acquirer can be informed of the incident. The
PCI Incident Report remains open until the incident is resolved. The PCI
Incident Report must be updated with any progress made and this must also be
communicated to the Merchant Acquirer through the normal channels. See
Section 0.

NB If the Initial Report and the evidence shows that a HNGX Data Centre may
be implicated then the incident is automatically a PCI Major Incident.

PCI Major Incident Declaration

If the POL Security Incident Manager decides the evidence received indicates a
PCI Major Incident the PCI Incident Report must be passed to the POL Head of
Information Security within 5 minutes.

The POL Head of Information Security will review the evidence and Severity
Analysis and must confirm or downgrade the Analysis.

If the Severity Analysis is confirmed this is entered into the PCI Incident Report
and a PCI Major Incident is declared.

The POL Head of Information Security must pass a copy of the PCI Incident
Report to the Head of Product and Branch Accounting in the Finance
Department so that the Merchant Acquirer can be informed of the Major
Incident. The PCI Incident Report must be updated by the POL Head of
Information Security as part of the Working Group (see Section with any
progress made and this must also be communicated to the Merchant Acquirer
through the normal channels.

See Section 0.

PCI Minor Incident Management Process

A PCI Minor Incident will not have occurred within the HNGX Data Centres.
However applications hosted within the HNGX Data Centres may have been
used to compromise cardholder data.

PCI Minor Incidents could be a result of abuse of POL, RMG or Supplier staff
using privileges to obtain cardholder data from Audit, Transaction Enquiry or
other systems. Or they could be the result of PO Counter staff falsely obtaining
cardholder data at the Counter e.g. through techniques such as “skimming”.

The POL Security Incident Manager will obtain, confirm and review the
evidence of the incident. It is presumed that such evidence will be a copy of the
cardholder data that is purported to have been compromised. The content and
format of the cardholder data can point to how and/or where the incident may
have taken place.

Minor Incidents will be passed to and investigated by the POL Security Team.
The POL Security Team will become responsible for the incident and will report
progress back to the POL Security Incident Manager who will update the
Incident Report and distribute according to Section 0.

Whichever team receives a PCI Minor Incident Declaration will investigate the
incident following their normal processes and with due regard to safeguarding
evidence that may be needed for a prosecution.

PCI Major Incident Management Process

Introduction

In the event of a major incident, activities must be co-ordinated within the POL,
RMG and Supplier businesses in order to minimise adverse impact and protect
service to both customers and clients. Due to the large number of teams and
activities involved this cannot effectively be managed by POL Information
Security.

Consequently a PCI Major Incident requires the invocation of the Operations
Control Major Incident Management Process.

This process is identified in Operations Control Procedure CON/MGM/006. The
highest incident level in that process is Level 3 and is applicable to a PCI Major
Incident.

The reason that a Major PCI Incident is automatically a Level 3 Major Incident
is because the requirements of the forensic investigation process may necessitate
the decision to disconnect the entire data centre from all its connecting networks
in order to preserve and analyse the data within for evidence.

F/521/47
POL00001538
POL00001538

The steps toward making the decision to disconnect a HNGX Data Centre are
detailed in 0 below.

Differences from Operations Control Procedure CON/MGM/006

This description and the Operations Control Process refers to the ‘Working
Group’. This is made up of all or specified members of the POL Business
Protection Team, as selected by the POL Live Service Team for the specific
incident.

The investigation of a PCI Major Incident requires the formal engagement of an
external company approved by the MasterCard and VISA to provide a Forensic
Expert (FE). Normally this FE is imposed by the Card Scheme usually via the
Merchant Acquirer. However it is vital that POL engage their own pre-selected
FE.

The FE company will be selected by the POL Head of Information Security
from a list maintained within POL Information Security.

The POL Live Service Team within Operations Control retains the co-ordination
point for this incident process.

The POL Head of Information Security must be an active participant in the
Working Group. If the POL Head of Information Security is not available they
will appoint a substitute and will communicate this to the Live Service Team. If
the POL Head of Information Security cannot be contacted then the RMG Head
of Information Security will assume that role.

The POL Head of Information Security will report the progress and findings of
the forensic investigation to the Working Group established to manage the
incident.

The Working Group must ensure that the PCI Incident Report reflects any
progress made during the incident investigation and is formally communicated
to the Merchant Acquirer via the Head of Product and Branch Accounting.

The POL Security Incident Manager must re-locate to the HNGX Data Centre
where the investigation is taking place and act as coordinator and liaison
between the POL Head of Information Security, the HNGX Data Centre
Incident Response Team and the Forensic Investigation Team.

Reporting

Initial Reports

An Initial Report is the first indication received of the possible compromise
of cardholder data whilst in the POL environment (counters, business
processes, data centre networks, systems, suppliers etc).

An Initial Report is a term that describes the details that must be taken when
it becomes apparent that cardholder data may have been compromised.

An Initial Report may arise from any Supplier or External Agency or from
within POL or RMG.

An Initial Report may be taken by any of the channels that normally receive
calls from any party external or internal to POL. Examples of external
parties could be Law Enforcement Agencies, Suppliers, Merchant Acquirer,
APACS, members of the public, the media — this is not an exhaustive list.

The channels that might receive calls from external parties could be
Business Service Centres, RMG Corporate Security Centre, POL Security
Team, RMG or POL Portal Webmaster(s), eBusiness team, Horizon Service
Desk, POL Security Helpdesk.

Whichever channel receives a call from an external or internal (POL or
RMG) party should log the call using their local procedure and in addition
ensure they obtain the details for an Initial Report.

The details that must be taken for a Initial Report are defined in 0.

PCI Incident Reports

PCI Minor Incident reports must be completed and logged by the POL
Security Incident Manager using the HNGX Incident Report format or as
otherwise determined. Within any HNGX Incident Reports PCI Minor
Incidents must be clearly marked as such.

PCI Minor Incident Reports must be presented to the POL Head of
Information Security on a monthly basis.

Merchant Acquirer PCI Incident Reports

The POL Security Incident Manager should pass each PCI Incident Report
to the Head of Product and Branch Accounting in order that the incident can
be communicated to the Merchant Acquirer in accordance with the

Page 52 of 61

F/521/52
POL00001538
POL00001538

requirements of the contract between POL and the Merchant Acquirer.
Any change in the progress of an open incident will be reflected in the
Incident record and will be reported to the Merchant Acquirer as described.

This applies for both Minor and Major Incident Reports. The point at which
the reports are provided to the Merchant Acquirer are described in the
relevant sections above.

PCI Minor Incident Report Format

PCI Minor Incident Reports will include all the details of the Initial Report
plus the Severity Analysis. Additionally the PCI Minor Incident Report will
include a unique Incident number; a summary of the incident, status of
incident, issues arising from incident and chase/resolution dates.

Major Incident Reports

It is presumed that PCI Major Incidents will only occur within HNGX Data
Centres.

The POL Security Incident Manager will complete a PCI Major Incident
Report as soon as the incident is declared. This report will be made available
to all management involved in deciding how to manage the Incident.

The PCI Major Incident Report must include a unique incident reference
(which clearly shows the incident as Major) and will describe the incident,
the reason for the severity (which will also describe the evidence), the status
and the likelihood that the Data Centres are at risk.

PCI Major Incident Reports will be updated following the process for
reporting defined in the Operations Control Major Incident Management
Process.

The POL Security Incident Manager will liaise with external organisations
involved in the incident e.g. Third Parties, Forensic experts etc in preparing
a Post Incident Report. All such liaison will be communicated to the POL
Head of Information Security and be communicated via the channels
implemented within the Operations Control Major Incident Management
Process.

The POL Security Incident Manager will complete and distribute a post-
incident report, initially within one week of the incident. Such report will
include a root-cause analysis and will be passed to the POL Head of
Information Security to approve and distribute to senior management.

Testing

PCI DSS requires the plan be tested at least annually.

Test scenarios may be worked into the existing Business Continuity tests and

it is preferable for that Major Incident that this be the case.

Minor incidents should be tested more frequently and should cover likely

scenarios involving low numbers of cardholder details e.g. 100 PANs over 6

months

Tests should at least focus on:

a. ensuring that channels of communication work as expected and are

timely

ensuring that Initial Reports are accurate and reliable

ensuring that evidence is gathered

d. ensuring that severity analyses are conducted; are effective and are
appropriate

e. confirming that staff, third parties and especially key suppliers are
aware of their responsibilities and have effective incident processes
in place

f. confirming that all third party forensic response and capability is
appropriate and effective.

g. ensuring that lessons learned are adopted back into the incident
process

oe

Awareness and Training
PCI DSS requires that appropriate training be given to those with security
breach responsibilities.
This needs to ensure that the following teams, in PO Ltd, RMG and Third
Parties, are aware of their roles and responsibilities in the event of a
suspected and a declared breach:

a. Security teams

b. Helpdesk teams

c. Operations teams
Training needs to focus on:

a. how to complete an Initial Report;

b. ensuring that POL liability is not admitted

c. ensuring that Initial Reports are passed to correct contact

d. how to interpret evidence for Severity Analysis

Appendix A Payment Card Industry!

Card schemes set the business rules that govern the issue of the payment cards that carry
their logo. Typically, these rules apply throughout the world to ensure interoperability of
cards. In many countries, domestic schemes also operate. The schemes operate the
clearing and settlement of payment card transactions. In the UK, banks and building
societies must be members of the appropriate scheme to issue cards and acquire card
transactions. Examples of international card schemes in the UK are Visa, MasterCard,

American Express and Diners Club.

A Merchant Acquirer is a bank having a business relationship with
merchants, retailers and other service providers to process their plastic card
transactions. Acquirers obtain financial settlement from the card issuers,
typically via the card schemes which maintain the clearing systems, and pay
the proceeds to the merchant, charging a fee.

The Card Schemes define a security standard on all merchants which is
legally binding on all merchants by virtue of their contract with the
Acquiring Bank. For the purposes of this document the Merchant Acquirer
for POL is Streamline. This standard is the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS).

PCI DSS requirements are applicable if a Primary Account Number (PAN)
is stored, processed, or transmitted. If a PAN is not stored, processed, or
transmitted, PCI DSS requirements do not apply. At present the design for
HNGxX falls under these requirements.

The PCI DSS security standard requires a documented incident process for
any incident that affects or may affect the security of cardholder data. This
documented process is required to be audited and tested annually and must
be invoked should it be suspected that cardholder data may have been
compromised.

Cardholder data includes all data on the Payment Card or on its magnetic
stripe or encoded into the chip if it is a so-called Chip and Pin card. This
data includes but is not limited to the: Primary Account Number (PAN),
Cardholder name, Service code, Expiration date, Security codes (e.g. CVV2
etc), magnetic stripe data, PIN code etc.

12.9 Implement an incident response plan. Be prepared to respond
immediately to a system breach.

12.9.1. Create the incident response plan to be implemented in the event
of system compromise. Ensure the plan addresses, at a minimum,
specific incident response procedures, business recovery and
continuity procedures, data backup processes, roles and
responsibilities, and communication and contact strategies (for
example, informing the Acquirers and credit card associations)

12.9.2 Test the plan at least annually

12.9.3 Designate specific personnel to be available on a 24/7 basis to
respond to alerts

12.9.4 Provide appropriate training to staff with security breach

Appendix D Forensic Investigation of PCI Major Incident

Purpose and Background

The purpose of a forensic investigation is to:

a) Determine what logs and records need to be used for the investigation

b) Secure those logs and records as evidence

c) Examine the evidence gathered

d) Determine whether or not cardholder data was compromised via the
data centre

e) Report their findings to the Merchant Acquirer

It is assumed that this Major Incident involves the HNGX Data Centres. It is

a contractual requirement on POL that an external and fully qualified

forensic team must investigate a PCI Major Incident.

The POL Head of Information Security will maintain a list of approved

forensic investigators. No other forensic team may be involved without the

explicit written approval of the POL Head of Information Security otherwise

POL risks a breach of contractual obligations which may result in a cessation

of payment card processing by the Merchant Acquirer.

The forensic investigators may decide that the incident may only be resolved

by an elective disconnect of the Data Centres. The decision to disconnect all

or some of the systems that comprise HNGX will necessarily involve the

correct level of management.

Process Assumptions

a) There will be a phased approach to forensic investigation of data in
HNGx. This would utilise a principle of "least invasive to most
invasive".

b) — Once forensic experts are brought in this process allows POL a 2 week
window before an elective disconnect of IREI1 and / or IRE 19 might
need to happen.

c) The parallel steps i.e. Al, A2 etc, can only take place if there are
sufficient FEs to carry out those steps in parallel. Fewer resources will
increase the number of steps needed.

d) The process includes multiple checkpoints en route to validate the
need to invoke an elective disconnect.

e) Live service from IREI1 and IRE19 will be maintained as long as
possible with minimal interruption to service

f) There will be a period of investigation before it can be decided
whether or not an elective disconnect of HNGX Data Centres is
necessary. This will be nominally 2 weeks

g) Forensic copy will be required of only selected areas of the SAN in
IRE11 (DN if replication protocol allows it then this step may be
performed at IRE19)

Elective disconnect is the last option to be considered and only if
forensic investigation can be shown to require it.

Forensic experts (FE) briefed on design of data centre, PCI data flows,
storage locations, data formats ete - I think this is envisaged in the
Permeation Map.

Immediately suspend all planned changes to data centre servers,
applications, storage etc. I.e. no code releases, no servers deployed or
removed from service

All admin access to data centre hosts restricted to '"4 eyes" access e.g.
admins must be effectively escorted during any access to any host by
another admin.

Initiate an immediate physical security escalation of data centre
access. Secure data centre CCTV and access control records, work
records etc.

Initial Report reviewed by FEs to determine which systems, transport
networks or processes may be out of scope. This is based on a
comparison of the evidence against the data in the systems and
processes.

Based on the Initial Report FE assess what external links, servers,
applications, processes and storage might be compromised. All others
placed out of scope.

FE decides what SAN data must be secured and begins activities to
identify and secure that data

Any external links implicated are physically checked for monitoring
tools by external team from POL or RMG assisted by external FS staff
and escorted by FS data centre operations manager

FE review all SYSMAN3 logs

FE review IREI1 bladeframe server processes in live memory for
rogue processes (DN1 best information at present indicates this
activity could occur without interruption to live service - this
needs confirmation by architects) (DN2. This presumes that FS
can produce and maintain a list of authorised processes, sockets
and protocols for the processes in live memory. If not then this
step must be re-considered)

FE copy selected areas of SAN in IREI1 for systems and applications
in scope.

FE review SAN data

If none of the above yields sufficient information to exclude the
possibility that data has been compromised (and arriving at this stage
this is exceedingly unlikely) then elective disconnect of IRE11 is
invoked if that is the only remaining area of forensic investigation.

Appendix E Elective Disconnect of HNGX Data Centre

This is a major Business Continuity Event in which a Data Centre is
disconnected from its connecting networks in a planned and organised
manner.

It is similar to a major Business Continuity Incident but is different in that it
is planned and is forced by the requirement to comply with an obligation
under contract with the Merchant Acquirer.

The purpose of the Elective Disconnect is to ensure that no network based
process or traffic may deliberately or unintentionally change the state of the
processes or data in the affected environment.

The consequences of not complying may be the withdrawal of the facility to
process card transactions under that contract. This in itself may not have the
same overall effect on POL operations at the Counters as disconnecting the
Data Centre(s) but which may endure for a good deal longer. Whether this
would be the case and how much longer it would last depends almost
entirely on negotiation with the Merchant Acquirer.

The worst case scenario is one where the Merchant Acquirer is not
influenced by outside pressures or negotiation and denies POL the facility to
process any relevant payment card transactions until satisfied that the
security breach has been completely identified; that the breach did not
compromise or no longer compromises cardholder data.

Relevant payment cards are those falling under the contract with that
Merchant Acquirer. In the scope of this PCI Incident Plan that would be
Streamline.

Planning the Elective Disconnect

This ideally would have already been completed by the Data Centre supplier.

It should form part of the annual test of this plan.

The disconnect must identify two scenarios:

a). I The Primary Data Centre must be disconnected from its corporate
network, the internet and any other Data Centres

b) Specific systems within the Data Centre must be disconnected from
internal networks.

It should also include a planned re-connection. It might be assumed that
would be the same as bringing the Data Centre(s) back online after a major
BC incident. However a test would demonstrate whether this would be the
case or not and a test should therefore be undertaken.
