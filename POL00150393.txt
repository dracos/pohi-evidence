Hi Angela

See below a couple of comments that have come in response to Mark’s internal blog on the intranet. We are holding
fire re publishing anything like this but will want Mark to respond direct (I will draft).

I have checked on Huddle but cannot see that these people have any connection to the scheme. However it may be
that they have other issues with us, which would be useful to know please if your team could advise.

I will of course run potential responses from Mark past you.

Thanks

Mel

The number is irrelevent. In this country one person been sent to jail falsely as a result of POL's Infailable/robust or whatever
you want to call it these days IT system is a travesty. The fact over 150 came forward and you still dismiss them, why because it
is not in POL intrest to explain these problem when they can just bill the SPMR. The most glaring question is actually where is
all this money people “stole” it does not seem to be anywhere! You will also forgive me if the words of Mark “lifestyle Issues” (Yes
going to jail/been made bankrupt is a lifestyle issue) Davies do little to assure me. The visit to the Fujitsu centre that POL
denied/lied about until emails proving the contrary where produced? Gratz on having an IT system that "The review found no
evidence of system-wide problems’, I'm sure UK air traffic control, RBS Bank and all the other where equally as proud of their IT
system until it failed. At the rate you lot are going I suggest you "save it for the judge”

I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH YOUR BELIEF THAT POL HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY WOULD DO. i HAVE WORKED FOR
A NUMBER OF LARGE COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR AND HAVE FOUND POL TO BE THE WORST BY A MILE ON
ISSUES SUCH AS HORIZON, DATA PROTECTION, HONESTY,ETC. .
