Dear Executive Officer
RE: ASSESSMENT OF HORIZON SYSTEM
As part of the ongoing process of developing the Horizon system to meet the needs

of the future, Post Office Ltd are seeking feedback from Subpostmasters on the
current operation of the system.

I am told that this assessment will involve a number of activities, one of which is to
elicit views by way of questionnaires. Post Office Ltd have asked that the Executive
Council be part of this exercise and I enclose two questionnaires on the system plus
a reply slip indicating that you wish to be included on a database for future I
consultative activity. The completed documents should be returned in the enclosed
pre-paid envelope directly to Post Office Ltd.

I have been asked to circulate the nine-page questionnaire to an NFSP group of
around 25 people and therefore will circulate this to Regional Secretaries in addition
to the Executive Council.

Post Office Ltd will be sending the same questionnaires to a random sample of
Subpostmasters.

Yours sincerely

MARILYN STODDART
Assistant General Secreta

Updating the Horizon system — getting your views

Over the coming years, the Horizon system will need to be updated to take
account of new products and new ways of doing business. We want to get
your feedback on the system, to make sure that the next generation of Horizon
is as effective as possible.

The enclosed short questionnaire has been developed to get your views on the
current system. This is supporting other activity, including a small number of face to
face focus groups with agents.

We understand this is a busy time of the year but we really want to take account of I
front line users’ views in developing future plans. It's a great opportunity for you to H
share your experiences with us and provide input into the future of the business.

With your consent, we would like to record your details as someone who is willing to
become involved in reviewing changes. This could mean you are invited to get
involved in future activity, potentially to test new kit or materials before national
launches. Please complete the reply slip if you are willing to get involved and return
it with the questionnaire.

It should take no more than 10-15 minutes to complete the questionnaire. Please
return it and the reply slip in the enclosed S.A.E by 10" December 2004.

Thank you for your contribution.

Yours sincerely,

Ben Gildersleve
