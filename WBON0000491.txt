Christopher

It was good to meet you the other day at Counsel's chambers.

Please find attached an extract from our draft Defence that relates to Horizon. There are a few other odd paragraphs
in the Defence on which we may need your input but this extract is the main factual section on Horizon.

I should be grateful if your team could review this extract and provide any comments they may have. In particular, if
they could flag and explain any points that they believe not to be correct that would be much appreciated.

Would it be possible to complete this review by close of business on Thursday?

Kind regards

Andy
