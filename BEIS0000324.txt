Thank your for your letters of 26 and 30 July conveying the concerns of your
members about the future of the post office network and covering the Federation’s

response to the Government’s White Paper on Post Office Reform.

I attach a letter which you may wish to publish in your monthly journal on how the

Government sees the future of the post office network.

Given the current pressures on my diary I am afraid that a further meeting with you
in early autumn might prove difficult. I suggest instead that an early meeting with
Alan Johnson, as the new Minister with particular responsibility for Post Office

issues, would be valuable. His diary secretary is Bill Rose on!

I am pleased that the work of the Horizon Working Group is progressing well and am

grateful for your contribution to its work. I am sure that you will be in touch with

developments in Government thinking on the network as a result of your

participation in the Group.
