Dear All

In advance of the tomorrow's meeting at One Essex Court (starting at 10am), please find attached a starting list of
topics to be discussed. There may be further areas which Tony and Owain wish to expand into but I hope the list will
cover the main areas.

Please also find attached:

e Generic Particulars of Claim (Kath / Huw â€” there is no need to read the whole document but I would suggest
having a brief look at the paragraphs referred to in the agenda).

e Briefing notes which have been provided to Counsel on these topics:
o Note on paragraphs 12, 19.2 and 19.3 of the GPOC
o Briefing note on transaction acknowledgments
o Briefing note on balancing / transaction corrections
If there are any questions, please let me know.
Kind regards

Amy
