Dear Belinda and David

Further to Christa’s email below, I attach the draft work plan. It sets out the potential issues you discussed with Christa
last week or which we have so far identified and the work we propose to do in respect of them with a view to preparing the
report. Please do let us know if you have any comments.

Kind regards

Jonathan

Subject: Mediation Scheme- confidential and privileged

Dear Belinda and David

Thank you for the documents you sent through following our meeting last week.

Jonathan Swil is the Managing Associate who is going to work on this matter with me and he and I have put together a
brief workplan which Jonathan can send you later. All comments will be gratefully received. In the meantime, we are
working our way through the documents and issues and I thought that it would be sensible to catch up by telephone on
Thursday so that we can tell you where we have got to and what questions we have.

Please let Jonathan and/or me know if you think that this is a sensible way to proceed.

Best regards

Christa
