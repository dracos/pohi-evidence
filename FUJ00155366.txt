Log : The following information has been sent to me via Email from Tbrahim @ NBSC

n Wednesday 12/12 the BM stock unit had a gain of £465.73. As this stock unit rolled over it was forced to clear local suspense
k1083.76- . The gain of £465.73 did not go to local suspense and is not included in the £1083.76-.

[this was not the last stock unit to roll over. The last stock unit to roll over was MIS at 10:20 on 13/12. This stock unit had no
discrepancies. MIS is a correction stock unit and was not inactive as it is rolled every BP.

the suspense account and final balances corroborate the above as the office has sent us copies.

[the Trading statement agrees with the suspense account and that BM stock cleared suspense but did not send its gain to suspense,
[fhe Trading position line should always show zero. Under the BM stock column it shows £465.73-.

It have had a trial done on BM stock to see if this is showing the £465.73 but it is not.

Stockunit BM was being rolled over on counter 1 at the same time that the various BOD of day pri es were being run in the
background around 7pm. It was during the CABSProcess that the following message was written to the audit log...

SU: €PostTxnsToLocalSuspense (:-1056374781) Timeout occurred waiting for lock. (0xC1090003) CreateMessageEx:
IRiposteCreateMessageEx call failed.

[fhe messages that should have posted the £465.73 gain in stockunit BM to local suspense failed to be written. Consequently, when
liccal suspense was cleared (written off to Pél in this case) the £465.73 wasn't taken into account and this resulted in the -
465.73 trading position seen on the Branch Trading Statement.

Routing call to development to investigate further and improve the error handling so that following the failure to write messages
the system doesn't carry on regardless.

[Start of Response]

the fact that EPOSS code is not resilient to errors is endemic. There seems little point fixing it in this one particular case
because there will be many others to catch you out. For example when I tried to balance with CABSProcess running I found that
ldeclaring cash failed with the same sort of error message!

Itt may be worth passing on the general message to the HNGx team that in many cases code should always try and exit gracefully
Jafter an error and not just blunder on regardless.

Hhis is a perfect example of why. Had the balancing code exited gracefully then if the user had tried again after CABSProcess had
finished working then all would have been well.

ror the time being I propose a much cheaper solution then re-writing a lot of EPOSS error handling.

the problem is that because of a previous PEAK (PC0140715) CABSProcess writes out messages atomically. It does a StartTransaction
lite early on (which creates the lock), then initiates writing lots of transactions with CreateMessage and persistent objects
ith PutObject and finally really writes them with a call to EndTransaction (which ends the lock). If something else tries to
rite a transaction whilst CABSProcess has things locked then it will time out after 10 seconds. Hence if CABSProcess takes more
than 10 seconds to run you could get this sort of problem. In this case CABSProcess took 33 seconds to run which gives a
significant window of opportunity for this sort of problem to occur. I suggest addressing this matter directly by having
caBsProcess store all that it wants to write out to a collection and then only really write it out at the very end. In this way
the system will be locked for less than 10 seconds and there will be no possibility of this sort of problem.
