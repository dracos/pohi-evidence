Audit of Post Office@Allerton, Branch Code 364511.

On the Thursday 19 June 2008, accompanied by my colleague Paul Holland Audit
Officer, I conducted an audit of the above named branch.

The purpose of the audit was to verify financial assets due to post Office® and confirm
compliance with a range of Business processes, procedures and regulatory requirements.

The financial audit revealed a current trading position of £ 8724.62 short. A breakdown

of this figure, including any pending transaction corrections or losses being settled
centrally, can be found below.

The difference between these figures is broken down as follows:

£ 115.62 - Identified as a difference in cash figures

£ 1602.15 - Identified as a difference in stock figures

£ 0.14 - Identified as a difference in postage figures

£ 59.63 + Identified asa difference in foreign currency figures
£ 8836.72 - Cheques on hand figure

£ _10495.00_- Total shortage

In addition to the above, the following amounts are noted, effectively reducing the
above figure to:

£ 1770.38 + Outstanding amount, previously settled centrally, as confirmed
with Product & Branch Accounting on the day of the audit

£ 8724.62 - Total shortage

Paul and I arrived at the branch at 08.20am and introduced ourselves to Mrs Williams the
sub postmaster, and advised that we were to perform an audit on behalf of Post Office
Ltd®.

Mrs Williams allowed us access to the post office area, and was present whilst the audit
was carried out.

I contacted the Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) at approximately 09.00 am and
advised that an audit would be performed at the branch, and that it would remain closed
until its conclusion. The nominated branches offered were: Mark and Wedmore.

The audit result was £10495.00 on the day of the audit but there is a credit outstanding
at Chesterfield fro £1770.38 so the actual trading position for the office is £8724.62
shortage.

I asked Mrs Williams to lag on to the horizon system so I could add myself to the system
to obtain the required reports. Paul started to count the stock and ! was counting the
cash, the cash was £115.62 short so I asked Mrs Williams to check my figures which she
did and agreed with them.

I printed off an office snapshot and there was a cheque figure on hand for £8836.72 I
asked Mrs Williams if the cheques were on hand, she replied there were no cheques on
hand. She said she was unaware of an amount in her cheque on hand figure until she
received a phone call on 22 May 08, from a lady saying that there had been a error in her
cheques to EDS, she talked her through the procedure and then said her cheque figure
should now be zero, but it showed £8836.72. It was then Mrs Williams realised there was
something wrong.

Mrs Williams said that she had not had a visit from anyone from the post office since
August 2206, which was Maggie Hatch BDM, which since speaking to you was not right
as she had a trainer in October 2006. She said the only help she gets is from the helpline
when she has a problem.

Before the audit I rang Cathy Macdonald and Tracey (cheque errors) in Chesterfield to
find out the background of the office and I got told that there has been so many T/Cs
issued it would be best to ring when at the office.

When we were at the office Paul looked for the cheque on hand figure on the balance
snapshots and it showed that there had been a cheque figure in the account every
month from May 06 to date. I have sent you a list of all the amounts.

When I spoke to Tracey in Chesterfield on the day of the audit, I gave her the details Paul
had found and she said she would ring back. Linda rang back with every cheque T/C that
had been issued, which was 36 T/C’s, it showed a credit of £17522.10 and debit of
£16849.02. I have also sent this to you.

The procedure for cheque error’s has changed, now the office is rang up by Chesterfield
and told to remit the amount of errors and this will reduced the cheque on hand figure,
where as before a T/C was sent to office and when the office accepted it would give a
credit or charge but did not automatically alter the cheque on hand figure. I believe this

is where problems occurred as when Mrs Williams received a T/C she accepted and
settled centrally but did not alter cheque on hand figure. Also she has not always
remitted out the cheques sent to EDS, we can prove this the case on the 18" and 19"
April 2008, it showed on the transaction log we printed off. Linda also confirmed that
this was part of the error Chesterfield had asked Mrs Williams to remit out on the 22 May
2008. When Paul spoke to Linda she said that they are not aware of any outstanding
T/Cs at present. Mrs Williams was also making the mistake of remitting out to EDS the
figure on the cheque listings and not the actual amount of the cheques.

Jalso rang Jackie in the Agent Debt team and she confirmed there had been a vast
amount of T/C’ and balance discrepancies settled centrally.

There was also a shortage of £1602.15 in the stock which was mainly in the special
stamp’s, Mrs Williams said she thought she could have returned the Christmas stamp’s
with out remitting them out of the system. I did speak to Paul at Chesterfield and he is
going to ring me back.

The office is being rolled over into the next TP a week later then it should, Mrs Williams
said that on the correct rollover date it only says she can roll into next BP. I can not see
that is right as when we did the final balance at the audit it came up ‘do you want to roll
in to next TP or BP. When we arrived at the office the office was in TP2 but the stock unit
in TP3, I rolled the office into TP3. The printer does not work so no reports can be printed
only previewed, Mrs Williams did say she put a new drum in as she was told but it still will
not print.

I also notified Paul Whitaker, Investigation Team Manager at 13.00pm to relay these
findings.

The decision taken was to precautionary suspend Mrs Williams at 13.30pm the assets
were secured in safe until a relief could be found or a defund arranged. I took the two
safe keys and sent them to Steve Parsons, Field Change Advisor on 20 June 2008...

The audit and subsequent transfer of the branch was concluded at 15.00pm. The branch
was rolled into TP3 BP3 and a Final Account produced.

The amount of £10495.00 was posted to Late Account; the £1770.38 credit is already in
the account at Chesterfield.

No Compliance Tests were carried out at this audit other than those control gaps that
were observed whilst on site.

I have sent you today (20/06/08) the list of cheque T/Cs, the list of the amount of
cheques on hand each month since Mrs Williams took over and the transaction logs for
cheques accepted and cheques remitted out.
