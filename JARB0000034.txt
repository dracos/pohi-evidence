I know that my office has been in touch with both the Post Office and 2"¢ Sight over
summer, passing on individual cases and securing a draft form of words from you that has
been passed to the Justice for SubPostmasters Alliance for its perusal.

I have now had a letter back from Mr Alan Bates of the Alliance, and enclose a copy here. I
wonder if you might address his points about both offering full immunity to those who come
forward, and the possibility of mentioning the investigation in the Post office’s Subspace
magazine, clearly to encourage those who would like their cases investigated to submit their
details? I have written to him letting him know that I would be writing to you, and attach a
copy of my letter and his here.

I shall also write to 2" Sight, asking for their comments on the points he raises that are
relevant to them.

I should mention that I have already written to him stating that I do not want to interfere
with the investigations, especially by dictating terms to the investigators who know their job
far better than either he or I.

Many thanks for your help with this.
