            POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY
               First Witness Statement of Stephen Muchow

In response to `Request for information pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006

— Request number 1, regarding matters falling within Phases 2 and 3 of the Inquiry',

I, Stephen Muchow, will say as follows:


Professional background

1.   I joined ICL in 1979 as a VME Operating Systems Consultant and participated

     in the performance testing of the Computerisation of PAYE project.

2.   Between 1985 and 1990 1 worked in ICL Customer Services Division (CSD),

     developing Service Management Systems, Knowledge Based Systems for

     ICL's mainframe diagnostic processes, CSD's call management system, and

     CSDs strategy for automated field resource management.

3.   Between 1990 and 1993 I was CSD's West Midlands Area Manager and then

     South East Region Manager.

4.   In 1993 I led CSD's IT Development and Business Process Engineering team.

5_   In March 1995 I joined the Bid Team of ICL Pathway Ltd. as Service Definition

     Manager and was appointed Customer Service Director in November 1996.

6.   In March 2001 I was appointed Business Director, Pathway.

7.   I left Pathway in January 2003 to lead Fujitsu's bid for Inland Revenue's

     ASPIRE business in partnership with Capgemini_

8.   From 2005 to 2007, I led Commercial Business Unit's Bid Engagement and

     Service Solution Design teams and its Utilities Business Unit.

9.   I later had senior roles in the UK and abroad until my retirement from Fujitsu in

     Iur~. ii11TWZilSI'l

                                                                                   WITNO4590100




Role in relation to Pathway and Horizon

10. I joined ICL Pathway's bid team as Service Definition Manager in March 1995.

       My role was to define Operational Service solutions for BA and POCL and

       provide ICL's response to their requirements as described in the Codified

       Agreement Schedule A15 (document WITNO459_0111 - FUJ00000071). This

       required my knowledge of ICL Customer Service organisations and partners,

       their processes, and service delivery capabilities.

11. In November 1996, 1 was appointed Customer Service Director.

12. In March 2001, I was appointed Business Director.


Customers and Users

13. My customers were Post Office Counters Ltd. and the Benefits Agency.

14. I had no formal involvement with end users although I did occasionally meet

       some Post Masters and Counter Staff at BA/POCL's communications events

       where they demonstrated the Horizon System and Infrastructure to them. Some

       trained Counter Staff were also involved in the testing of Horizon during Model

       Office Rehearsals (MOR), e.g., MOR1 which completed satisfactorily on

       26 August 1998 as reported in Bob Burkin's letter on 11 September 1998 in

       document WITNO459 01/2 - POL00028100.

Role

15. During this period, I was Customer Service Director.

16. I established the CS team to manage the definition, supply, and delivery of

       Pathway's service proposal, and develop CS Operating Procedures.

                                                                                   WITNO4590100




CAPS Board

17. The CAPS (Customer Accounting and Payments Strategy) Board represented

     the Benefits Agency in the integration and delivery of Benefits Encashment

     Service into the Horizon Programme.

18. 1 cannot recall details of specific occasions when I attended a CAPS Board. My

     involvement would only have been to present Pathway's Customer Service

     processes and performance i.e., Incident Management and Service Levels.


Incomplete Transactions

19. The issue of Incomplete Transactions (originally known as Lost Transactions)

     was a major concern.

20. As described in my correspondence with Vince Gaskell, document

     WITNO459_01/2 - POL00028100, eleven causes of this issue were identified.

     Most cases were due to unexpected user action, i.e., the user provided input

     that was different to that which was expected by the system. Most of these

     errors were subsequently mitigated by improvements to the user interface

     making it more resilient. Advice was also given to POOL, Post Masters and

     Counter Clerks to reinforce correct operating procedures.

21. By August 1998, the number of Incomplete Transactions had reduced to less

     than 3 in 10,000 transactions and by November they had further reduced to 1.6

     in 10,000, as reported in document WITNO459_01/3 - POL00028415.


Relevance of Incomplete Transaction issue to the Inquiry

22. This issue was regarded by BA and POCL as a potential indicator of improper

     conduct or as a risk to the financial integrity of the accounts and was seen as

     being of extreme importance by all parties.

23. BA and POCL could have been seen as being responsible for the improper

     distribution of public funds.

                                                                                   WITNO4590100




24. Pathway's reputation for System Integrity and Security could be impeached.

25. Public confidence in the Post Office and Horizon could be damaged.


Helpdesks and Customer Services

26. CS worked with BA and POCL and ICL Partners to define the Horizon System

     Helpdesk processes and procedures and its interfaces with third parties and

     with POCL National Business Support Centre (NBSC)_


Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH)

27. The HSH provided the first point of contact for all users requiring assistance or

     fault resolution and was always available (except on Christmas day).

28. It was operated by ICL Operational Services Division (OSD) and provided 1st

     Level (HSH) and 2nd Level (SMC) support.

29. Some 2nd Level support was also provided by the ICL Pathway System Support

     Centre (SSC).

30. The HSH also provided a single point of contact for information in respect of the

     operational status and performance of Horizon infrastructure.

31. Three levels of fault resolution service were provided:

      •   Level 1 for simple calls that could be resolved within 5 minutes

      •   Level 2 for more complex or hardware calls that could be resolved within

          30 minutes


      •   Level 3 for calls that required support from one of the technical support or

          development teams


32. A 4th Level of support was provided by Development teams who would review

     issues and recommendations forwarded by the SSC. Ultimately, all code errors

     would be resolved by Development and incorporated into a software

     maintenance release or, with POCL's agreement, a future major release.

                                                                                    WITN04590100




Level 1 Support

33. At Level 1, Helpdesk staff recorded details of the problem being reported, and

     the circumstances in which it arose, into the PowerHelp System. They were

     able to determine if there had been an infrastructure (hardware or network)

     failure or an operational error.

34. Helpdesk staff had been trained in POCL's operating procedures and

     documented scripts were available that enabled them to check the caller had

     followed the procedure accurately. If the problem could not be resolved at Level

     1 it was escalated to Level 2.


Level 2 Support

35. At Level 2, more experienced SMC staff would either resolve the problem or, if

     not, gather any diagnostic evidence required before escalating to Level 3 or

     dispatching a Field Support Engineer to the Post Office.

36. Level 2 staff also had access to the Knowledge Base (KEL) which could be

     searched to identify if this problem had been reported before and if a solution or

     workaround had already been found.


Level 3 Support

37. Level 3 was provided by the Systems Support Centre (SSC) whose staff dealt

     with new and more complex issues - problems that had not been seen before

     that may have indicated faults in the software, infrastructure, or configuration

     reference data. All such problems were recorded in the PINICL system.

38. The SSC worked with product development and test teams to ensure that they

     had as much information as possible to replicate the problem and design a fix.

39. The SSC would determine if a temporary solution, such as a procedural

     workaround, was available. All recommendations involving procedural

                                                                                 WITNO4590100




      workarounds had to be approved by POCL National Business Support Centre

      (NBSC).


POCL National Business Support Centre (NBSC)

40. The NBSC provided a helpdesk that was the first point of contact for Post

      Masters for PO business related enquiries and complex incidents such as

       •   Non-core product transactions

       •   Requests to extend their Cash Account Period

       •   Security problems

       •   PO procedural problems

       •   Complaints about the Horizon System

41.   There were clearly defined responsibilities and interface processes between the

      HSH and NBSC as described in document WITNO459 01/4 - FUJ00080406.


Evolution of Helpdesks

42    The HSH and NBSC were new organisational units being established from

      scratch and as such evolved organically through gathering knowledge and

      experience during the initial release phases of the Horizon System.

43. Regular meetings were held between HSH, NBSC and Pathway to discuss

      processes, procedures, and improvement plans.


Complaints Procedure

44. The Customer Service Complaints Procedure, and the Fujitsu teams involved,

      are described in documents WITNO459_01/5 - FUJ00079861, WITNO459_01/6

      - FUJ00079826, and associated documents referenced therein.

45. Complaint calls could be received both by the HSH and NBSC Helpdesks and

      were dealt with according to the agreed procedures.

                                                                                  WITNO4590100




46. Written complaints could also be received. Sometimes these were submitted on

     a Feedback Card that had been given to the SPM following a visit by an ICL

     Engineer attending a hardware fault.


Helpdesk IT Systems

PowerHelp System

47. PowerHelp was the logging system used by HSH to log incidents at the

     Stevenage and Manchester call centres. The incidents were recorded into

     PowerHelp by 1st Level Support staff and were accessible by 2nd and 3rd

     Level support.


KEL Database

48. The KEL was a searchable Knowledge Database that was designed and

     maintained by the SSC. It contained descriptions of problems that had been

     reported both by customers and by support staff. It documented anything and

     everything that the SSC staff found to be useful in diagnosing causes, potential

     solutions, or workarounds.

49. 2nd Level Support and above were able to access the KEL.


PINICL System

50. PINICL was the system used by 2nd and 3rd Level Support (SSC) and 4th

     Level Support (Development) to record and manage fault incidents. The source

     of input to PINICL was the PowerHelp incident logged by HSH 1st Level

       ...


PEAK System

51. I am not familiar with PEAK other than it was developed by the SSC to replace

     the PINICL system.

                                                                                     WITN04590100




Helpdesk Training

52. All Helpdesk staff received in-depth training in advance of roll out from

     Pathway's training partner ICL Training Services Ltd. who developed the

     training programme in conjunction with POCL for delivery to Post Office staff.

53. Scripts were developed to enable helpdesk staff to determine whether the

     correct operating procedure for each transaction type had been followed.

54. Helpdesk scripts were reviewed and agreed by POCL.

55. Issues, such as those identified by the NBSC regarding incorrect advice given

     by the HSH in respect of the Cash Account, were reported through the Service

     Review Forum.


Systemic Issues

56. Systemic Issues i.e., those affecting all installations were detected by 3rd Level

     Support and were reported to the NBSC and escalated to Development.

57. These were treated with the highest priority since they represented a potential

     business continuity risk.


Effectiveness of Helpdesk and Complaints Procedures

58. The procedures were effective and, with growing confidence and familiarity with

     Post Office business, Helpdesk staff individually improved their performance

     over time.

59. There were three complex and challenging factors that were the main causes of

     anxiety for all parties. These were:

      1. HSH SLA Performance:

          Here, the ability of OSD to recruit sufficient of the right staff and managers

          for the helpdesk was of concern. Their continuous failure to meet Service

          Levels would cause Pathway to incur financial penalties or even contract

          termination.

                                                                                  WITNO4590100




      2. Incomplete Transaction issues:

         Misunderstandings of the correct procedures to be followed by Counter

         Staff when transactions were interrupted and resumed or not completed

         caused issues that posed a real risk to the financial integrity of the

         accounts and could potentially damage Public perception of Horizon and

         BA/POCL.

      3. Cash Account issues:

         Automation of the weekly Cash Account process was a key performance

         benefit of Horizon, both to POCL and to Post Masters. Did HSH staff

         properly understand the importance and complexity of the Cash Account

         process from a Post Masters perspective? Were the call scripts accurate

         and unequivocal in the advice to be given when diagnosing Cash Account

         problems?

60. NBSC and Pathway teams worked hard together to improve their operating

    procedures and incident handling scripts — particularly in respect of Cash

    Account issues. Extra training was provided to HSH and their access to counter

    infrastructure hardware was improved. Most of the causes of Incomplete

    Transactions were mitigated through modifications to the software making it

    more resilient to unexpected user input.


Relationship with POCL

61. I met with most members of the Horizon management team at one time or

    another. Most of my meetings were with Andy Radka, Head of Business

    Service Management, and Keith Baines who represented POOL Contract

    Management.

62. The relationship between Pathway and BA/POOL was always very cordial and

    professional. Pathway was held to account for its failures, and we were acutely

    aware of the potential impact upon BA and POOL of not meeting our Service

                                    Page 9 of 24

                                                                                    WITNO4590100




     Level Agreements (SLAs). There was a financial penalty imposed on Pathway

     when SLAs were not met. It was therefore of mutual interest and benefit to

     cooperate to get the new automated processes working to specification.

63. I was comfortable with the division of responsibilities between POCL and

     Pathway. Detailed explanations of which are documented in the Interface

     Agreement for the NBSC and HSH document WITN0459_0117 - FUJ00080405

     and in the Interface Agreement for Problem Management document

     W11N0459 01/8 — FUJ00079886.

64. In my experience, the POCL Horizon Management Team was always diligent,

     professional, and courteous. I had no concerns regarding their ability to

     represent POCL effectively.


Relationship with Development Teams

65. Relationships within Pathway were good with everyone sharing a common goal

     to deliver Horizon. We would often meet socially after work to relax.

66. We worked long hours, and the pressure to deliver was intense and this

     sometimes resulted in moments of tension.

67. Plans for delivering our respective pieces of the programme did not always

     converge in the right place at the right time and sometimes there were

     disagreements about relative priorities and responsibilities, for example

     between achieving a software release deadline, completing a test schedule, or

     diagnosing and fixing bugs in the live estate. That is the nature of this type and

     scale of programme development.

1QQR - 1000


Quality of Support

68. During this period, our service performance was not good enough, and

      Pathway was subject to SLA penalties.


Main Challenges for CS

69. The main challenges facing CS remained as before but were exacerbated by

      the larger estate and higher call volumes.

70_   Hardware Engineers were a shared resource, and I wondered if their response

      times were sometimes extended due to them delivering service to other

      customers — this was the responsibility of the SMC to manage.

71. I was concerned that a higher proportion of calls were escalated (handed off)

      by the HSH to the SSC than should have been, particularly during times of high

      call volumes.

72. It was planned that Postmasters and their Counter Staff should receive their

      training no more than five days before installation of their counter systems. This

      was not always the case and there was sometimes either a delay to the rollout

      schedule or training had to be brought forward thus extending the five-day gap.

      I wondered if during this period of waiting, some of their training had been

      forgotten and consequently they relied more heavily than we had expected on

      the Helpdesk.

73. Cash Account Calls remained a particular concern and some complaints were

      received about the accuracy of advice given to Postmasters by the Helpdesk.

      This required urgent action to reinforce staff training and improve call scripts.

74_   Call handling and resolution times did improve over time but not quickly enough

      to avoid SLA performance penalties.

75. Reference Data processes were fragile and there were several issues in

     respect of missing, incomplete, or incorrect data supplied to Pathway by POOL

     which caused major disruption.

76. There was an issue of unnecessarily high volumes of reference data being

     transferred. It made no sense to process data that reflected no-change'

     changes to the estate e.g., Updating the price of a stamp from 80p to 80p.

77. ISDN network interfaces were also problematic. I recall that system errors were

     caused because of faults in the network that remained undiagnosed.

     Permanent corrective action was impossible without pinpointing the root cause,

     but these faults were often transient and appeared to correct themselves

     without apparent intervention.


PINICLs

78. I have no recollection of the number of PINICLs generated nor the relative

     urgency with which they were treated during this period, but I believe that all

     PINICLs were discussed with the business owner (BA, POOL or Pathway) and

     their relative importance, impact and priority for action assessed.


Staffing Levels

79. In the start-up phase of any complex system programme, proportionately more

     staff are needed than are expected to be required once a system has achieved

     steady state maturity.

80. I do not remember staff turnover in CS being an issue. The programme had a

     good reputation and attracted and retained some of the best people both from

     within ICL and from external IT Contractors.

81. I was always concerned about the ability of OSD to provide sufficient staff to

     operate the HSH and SMC effectively and this was borne out by their persistent

     failure to meet SLAs. On two occasions I requested that OSD should raise a

                                                                                    WITN04590100




     Red Alert to secure assistance from the company to help them resolve their

     recruitment issues.

82. I had no concerns about the ratio of SSC to Development staff during my time

     with Pathway nor was I concerned about their competence or ability to do their




Relationship with POCL/POL

83. The relationship with BA/POCL remained professional and cordial throughout,

     although they were justifiably annoyed and anxious that we were still not

     achieving our SLAs.


Post Rollout

Quality of support

84. Disappointingly slow progress was being made by HSH and SMC. They were

     still failing to meet their SLAs and urgent action was required.

85. Post Masters were still experiencing difficulties with the Cash Account and

     Cash Account calls on Wednesdays remained high.


Customer Feedback

86. A Help Desk Forum was established between ICL OSD, Pathway CS and

     POCL NBSC_ This forum provided the opportunity to discuss problems and

     complaints and share ideas to improve overall service performance.


Main Challenges for CS

87. To ensure that ICL OSD were providing enough trained staff in the HSH and

     SMC and were able to achieve their SLAs_

88. To ensure that all new HSH staff were familiarised with call scripts and gave

     callers confidence that they were being provided with accurate information.

CS Audits 1998 - 2000

89. These audits were an indicator of our state of readiness for National Rollout

     and were taken very seriously.

90. All recommended corrective actions and improvement suggestions were

     prioritised and addressed.


Service Performance — June 2000

91. The Service Review performance statistics from June 2000, (documented in

     WITNO459_0119 - FUJ00058228) report that when there were 8,500 live outlets

     there were approximately 17,000 calls for advice and guidance, 5,200 calls

     related to Cash Account, and 7,600 calls related to software.

92. I cannot recall the level of calls by category or whether they were in line with

     expectations, but the June statistics show the average number of calls received

     per outlet was consistently less than those received relating to the prior release.

93. What is not shown in the statistics is the distribution of calls amongst Post

     Offices. The concerns that possibly should have been raised either by Pathway

     or POOL are:

94. Of the 8500 live outlets only 5200 Cash Account calls were raised

      •   Which POs were having difficulties - how could they have been helped?

          Why were the other POs not having difficulties — was there a training

          anomaly?

          Was there any common denominator?

95. Given that all 8500 Post Offices were using the same software:

      •   Why did they all not encounter the same software problems?

      •   Could this have been due to differences in Reference Data?

96. POOL and Pathway performed extensive end-to-end testing before any new

     software version was released into the live estate:

      •     Why were these software problems not discovered during testing?


Involvement in Roll-Out?

97. I was not involved, the Implementation Director managed Roll-Out.


Pathway Board Meeting May 2000

Acceptance Incidents

98. I cannot remember what the three major acceptance incidents were, and I

     cannot find any reference to them in the documentation provided to me.


Red Alert

99. A Red Alert signalled to the lCL Board and to the wider company that the

     Alerting Division was experiencing a potentially business-critical issue. This

     required a mandatory response from all other company Divisions to offer

     whatever help and resources they could to remedy the cause of the alert. The

     responsibility remained with the Alerting Division to manage the alert to a

     successful conclusion.

100. This was the second occasion that Pathway had requested OSD to raise a Red

     Alert.

101. The critical issue in both cases was that SLAs were being missed and service

     performance, specifically of HSH, was deteriorating.

102_ The business-critical situation was that failure to meet SLAs for three quarters

     gave POCL the right to terminate our contract.

103. Finding and retaining enough of the right kind of helpdesk staff and managers

     was the main problem.

104_ The quality of customer support was unacceptably poor.

                                                                                     WITN04590100




The PINICL system

105. 1 was not directly involved in the use of PINICL, it was the system used by the

     SSC and Development teams to log and maintain records of faults.

106. Occasionally I would be requested either by CS or by Development to intervene

     on their behalf with POCL to establish or gain clarification on actions that were

     being considered.

107. PINICL was an effective system for resolving issues.

108. It met the needs of 3rd and 4t" Level Support, and it was flexible in that it was a

     relatively free format text-based system, and it enabled conversations to take

     place between multiple support staff cooperating to resolve an incident.

109. I am sure it also had limitations and it was subsequently enhanced and

     replaced by PEAK.


Incident Closure SLAs

110. There was always a sense of urgency to resolve and close incidents accurately

     and in time to meet SLAs. However, at no time during my employment was

     there any pressure to attribute issues to User Error rather than any other cause_

111. In cases where User Error was identified as the root cause this would have

     been recorded as such in PINICL and the KEL.

112. I do not think User Errors impacted on SLAs adversely.

113. Over time, commonly reported issues that were User Errors would have tended

     to improve overall SLA performance since they would have been easier to

     recognise and resolve more quickly, lowering the response and resolution

     times. They would also help reinforce correct operating procedures.

114. One potential adverse effect may have been the unnecessary engagement of

     Helpdesk staff at times of high demand, but these events would have been

     expected to diminish as users gained experience and confidence.

SLA Steering Group

115. I cannot find a reference to the SLA Steering Group other than in the text of

     PINICL PC005973 in document WITN0459_01/10 - FUJ00077521, in which it

     may have been misnamed.

116. I do not recall if such a Steering Group existed, although it may have been an

     internal Pathway forum to define the functionality of SLAM (Service Level

     Agreement Management) software which was part of Pathway's Data

     Warehouse suite of programmes.

117. SLAs were negotiated at Contract Review meetings between POCL and

     Pathway Contract Management teams.

118. Keith Baines (POCL) and Tony Oppenheim (Pathway) led these meetings.

119. I consider the Contract Review Meetings worked well. SLAs are an essential

     part of any service contract. They set the expectation and ground rules for

     service delivery and help build trust between customer and supplier and

     encourage improvements in service quality. We agreed an appropriate set of

     SLAs that were understandable and challenging but achievable.


Specific cases

PINICL Call Reference PC0041910 (WITN0459_01/18 - FUJ00066911)

120. The issue in this case was that the Gateway counter at each of three Post

     Offices was unable to receive inbound communications from the datacentre.

121. They were able to connect to the datacentre and successfully transfer

     transaction data. They were unable to produce their weekly cash account.

122. I do not specifically recall being involved in this incident but have no reason to

     doubt the information recorded in the PINICL. My interpretation of the PINICL

     text is as follows: NBSC was alerted, and I agreed with Bernadette O'Donnell

     that the post offices concerned would continue in the same Cash Account

     Period until new software and reference data had been committed. This would

     enable the three Post Offices to continue to operate until the problem had been

     resolved.

123. The matter was dealt with appropriately.

124. The SSC intervened to keep open the inbound connections from the Post

     Offices to the datacentre so that those connections could be used to distribute

     new software and reference data to all three Post Offices.

125. Without any reported intervention, the problem in one Post Office disappeared

     within four hours. No explanation was ever given by our supplier Energis (or

     their supplier BT).

126. The problem at Wisbech Post Office similarly disappeared after five days, again

     without any reported intervention.

127. The remaining fault at Northampton was cleared one day later.

128. None of the faults had been fully explained by Energis or BT even after five

     months of monitoring and remained a mystery.


PINICL Call Reference PCO026997 (WITN0459_01/11 - FUJ00075627)

129. This PINICL was used to progress two related issues concerning the

     presentation of SLA performance figures and the formulae that calculated them,

     and the reference data that matched transaction types to service measures.

130. The matter was dealt with appropriately.

131. I cannot remember the nature of any alleged disputes, but I know that all SLAs

     were agreed through negotiation. Occasionally, clarifications were sought to

     eliminate ambiguities and misunderstandings.

132. As part of contract renegotiation, the mechanism by which Counter Transaction

     Performance SLAs were reported changed completely, making this issue

     irrelevant. Therefore, this issue was closed.

133. These PINICLs were used to resolve a code error in the Contract

     Administration System (part of the Data Warehouse Management Information

     System) that had been discovered and which caused the transaction counts of

     Fallback Transactions to be counted twice.

134. CS initially requested for a fast-track fix, i.e., it was requested to be fixed during

     live trial.

135. The matter was dealt with appropriately.

136. The entry "Terry Austin & Steve Muchow have agreed that no Counter

     Transaction PinICLs will be fixed until complete agreement reached with POCL"

     relates to an agreement that Terry Austin and I had with POCL that we would

     not change code affecting Counter Transactions without their express

     permission. Post Office was in the process of revising their requirements for

     Transaction analysis and wanted to ensure that we did not make changes that

     would no longer be required.

137. The code at fault was in the process of being redeveloped, to incorporate new

     requirements so applying a fast-track fix to live trial may have caused a delay to

     the testing and implementation of the next release of software. Avoidable

     delays to the start of the roll-out programme were unacceptable.

138. POOL were always attentive and pragmatic in dealing with such issues. The

     accurate recording of Counter Transactions in Post Offices was paramount.

139. As always, our relationship with POOL in respect of these issues was cordial,

     and professional.

140. Counter Transactions are the core of Post Office business, and POOL was

     determined that Horizon should perform and record them accurately.

Call Reference PC0059753 (WITN0459_01/16 - FUJ00077521), (WITN0459_01/17

- FUJ00075368)

141 This PINICL was used to resolve a Reference Data issue.

142. There was an error in the Reference Data that linked products to transaction

     types. This caused SLA performance measures to be incorrectly calculated.

143. There was no error in the software, per se, but the Reference Data, which

     provided the parameters for the code to calculate the performance of each

     transaction type was incorrect. Think of this as though it were a formula error in

     an Excel spreadsheet.

144. The matter was not dealt with appropriately. It could have been resolved

     following Elaine Knott's entry on 5th February 2001 @ 10:27:00 in which she

     asserts the system had been tested and had reported correctly with the

     amended reference data.

145. The 'hot issue' contained in the entry of 13 March 2001 was one of accounting

     integrity, reporting accuracy and trust. Monthly invoices were due to begin in

     April and it was certain that POCL would examine them forensically. It was

     essential that we did not make any mistakes.


General

146. At no time during my employment with Pathway was there any contractual or

     other pressure to attribute issues to User Error rather than to the product.

147. The role of the Helpdesk was to provide advice and guidance on the operation

     of the Horizon system and to identify and record any faults or issues. I do not

     believe it was equipped to respond to the wider concerns of SPMs and their

     staff other than to refer their call to the NBSC or register a complaint.

148. I had no knowledge of the reasons for the prosecution of post office staff.

149. Looking back, I believe that most incidents were closed appropriately.

     My belief is that software incidents were closed only once a solution had been

     identified and incorporated into a software release schedule, or it had been

     agreed with POCL that no action was necessary. Hardware and Network

     incidents were closed only once full functionality had been restored.

150. Looking back, I can only speculate that the Board of lCL/Fujitsu were not aware

     of concerns raised by SPMs, managers and assistants relating to the operation

     of Horizon. Board members were regularly updated with Pathway's progress.

     They were made aware of Pathway's performance failures, the reasons for

     those failures and any ensuing financial penalties. They focused on Pathway

     meeting its contractual commitments and the Horizon System achieving the

     contracted acceptance criteria agreed with POCL. I am not aware that any

     specific concerns, raised by Post Office SPMs, Managers and Assistants were

     ever communicated to the ICL/Fujitsu Board either directly or by POOL.

151. Looking back, I can only speculate about the extent to which POL was aware of

     concerns raised by SPMs, managers and assistants relating to the operation of

     Horizon. The NBSC operated a Help Desk for post office staff, and they had

     access to Pathway's problem management system, PINICL, and the KEL which

     documented all the problems raised by post office staff through HSH.

     POOL conducted their own tests of the Horizon System in both a model office

     and a live environment. I do not know if, during their own tests, they

     encountered similar issues with Cash Account and Incomplete Transactions. If

     they did, then I do not know what, if anything, was done to alert and reassure

     SPMs.

152. At this moment, I know nothing of other matters that may assist the Chair.
