The information contained in this report is correct as at 3 January 2025.

1. Introduction

This report was commissioned from us by the then Minister Hollinrake
following discussion with the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, and
will be produced when the Department for Business and Trade (DBT)
requests it. This will be after the official transparency data is published on
the gov.uk website.

This report focuses on our current observations on progress and related
data for the GLO Compensation Scheme (‘the Scheme’). Please refer to our
first published report (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/glo-
compensation-scheme-financial-redress-reports-for-2024/july-2024-report-on-glo-
compensation-scheme-progress), which sets out an overview of our role, the
process involved in the Scheme and the definitions of any terms not stated
in this report.

2. Observations

We have continued to see the pace of the Scheme improve since our
previous report. The majority of claims have now been submitted, with the
balance expected to be submitted by the end of the first quarter of this year.

As shown in the GLO Scheme data section of this report, from the pool of
492 eligible GLO Scheme claimants, a total of 370 full claims! 220! 1)
(including claims for Fixed Sum Award!222te 2I) have been submitted. Of
those 370 full claims, DBT has issued offers on 346 claims (approximately
94% of full claims submitted) and offers have been accepted on 243 of
those claims (approximately 66% of full claims submitted).

Asmall number of claims have been referred to the Independent Panel.
Also, the part of the Scheme that provides for an exceptional review by the
Reviewer has started to be used. Having now had the procedure tested
end-to-end, we consider that the process is working well.

2.1 Influences on pace
RLIT0000578
RLIT0000578

As before, there have been a number of both positive and negative
influences affecting the pace of the Scheme. Some of the key factors are
noted.

Expert evidence

The significant delays previously experienced in obtaining expert reports for
certain moderate and complex claims for individual assessment!22t0le 3]
also appear to have alleviated. As noted above, the majority of claims have
been submitted, and we understand the balance will be submitted in the first
quarter of this year.

Delivery target for initial offers

DBT continues to meet, or be close to meeting, its delivery target of issuing
its initial offer to 90% of claimants who have submitted a full claim for
individual assessment. As at 3 January 2025, DBT achieved this benchmark
in 89% of cases. This inevitably has a positive impact on the pace of the
initial stages of a claim following submission.

2.2 Other issues

Progress of Challenge Cases

On those claims where DBT’s (first or subsequent) offer has not been
accepted in full (Challenge Cases), we have observed that progress has
been slower than we would expect. As a consequence, we have been
pushing the relevant parties to focus on minimising delays and to speed up
progress. We have received information to suggest that additional
resources are being directed to this and we should expect to see quicker
progress being made on Challenge Cases shortly.

In addition, DBT has recently introduced a target of providing a substantive
response within 40 working days to 90% of claimants who submit a
complete challenge from 1 December 2024. DBT considers a challenge to
be “complete” if DBT does not require any more information from the
claimant or their legal representative in order to provide a substantive
response.

We will continue to monitor the progress of Challenge Cases closely and
are putting mechanisms in place to ensure that the relevant parties have
increased visibility on this issue. We are also implementing a process
involving case management calls to address slower progress on specific
Challenge Cases.

Preliminary issue procedure

We have implemented a new procedure in the Scheme whereby, if we
consider the parties are likely to settle more quickly by the Independent
Panel issuing a binding decision on a specific issue (as opposed to the
claim as a whole), we will refer the preliminary issue to the Independent
Panel. We consider that this process will assist in achieving resolution more
quickly on certain claims where discrete issues preventing meaningful
progress have arisen.

*Given the definition of a “full claim’, these figures are necessarily
determined by DBT.

“This figure includes offers accepted before the introduction of the Fixed
Sum Award and subsequently topped up to £75,000. The figure is provided
by DBT as data relating to the topping up of any settled claims to the Fixed
Sum Award amount is not recorded on our system.

*“*This comprises claims for the Fixed Sum Award and claims for individual
assessment which are considered to be “full claims”. Further claims may
have been received, but not yet assessed to determine whether they are
“full claims”.

data

(in the order referred to in table)

Full claims Claims which DBT considers, with advice from its legal
advisors (Addleshaw Goddard), do not need any further
evidence to in order to assess every element of the claims.

Claims for Claims for the total fixed sum of £75,000 (inclusive of
Fixed Sum interest) per the option given to all eligible GLO claimants
Award to settle their claims on a full and final basis at this level.

This is instead of making a claim for individual losses to be
assessed in accordance with the GLO Scheme Guidance
and Principles. The number of “submitted” claims for the
Fixed Sum Award include both claims initially submitted for
the Fixed Sum Award, as well as claims originally
submitted for individual assessment that have since
moved to the Fixed Sum Award track.

Claims for Claims for full assessment of all heads of claim (not limited

individual to £75,000 inclusive of interest).

assessment

Claims The stage to which a claim moves if the claimant rejects

Facilitation DBT’s initial offer of settlement. During this stage, Dentons

stage Claims Facilitators will facilitate discussions and consider
appropriate next steps (e.g. an ADR call or a Senior
Session).

Panel stage The stage to which a claim may move if, after the Claims
Facilitation stage, the parties are unable to settle the
claim. It is at this stage that the claim will come before the
independent Panel.

Reviewer The stage at which a claim and the independent Panel's

stage final assessment in relation thereto may be considered by
the independent Reviewer. The GLO Scheme Guidance
and Principles sets out the Review Criteria for an
application to the independent Reviewer.
