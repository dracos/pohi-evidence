FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
(i)

(ii)

(ii)

Horizon Roll-out continued with over 4,500 offices
installed with the equipment. The Post Office was
involved with ICL in a tender to provide electronic
Government services — me.gov — in which the
automated Post Office network would play a leading
role.

PO00/33
Provisional profit results for February were:

- Royal Mail £35m
- POCL £(13)m (exec Horizon)
- Parcelforce £0 (exec Special Delivery)

The full year profit/loss forecasts were:

- Royal Mail £426m
- POCL £34m (exec Horizon)
- Parcelforce £(20)m (exec Special Delivery)

The group full-year post-tax profit forecast was currently
£337m against a target of £350m. There were
opportunities of improving this forecast by up to £55m,
with risks of £20m.

A risk to the profit forecast had emerged in the
revaluation of certain assets using valuation indices
which may be inappropriate.

The accounting treatment of the recovery of VAT on
Horizon had not yet been fully agreed. A letter from the
DTI confirming their understanding would be presented
to the auditors to help resolve the issue.

The Board agreed that in the light of continuing
uncertainties in the forecast year-end profit position, a

revised forecast would not be released to DT! until after
the Board meeting on 3 May.

Review the use of appropriate indices for the re-
valuation of assets.
