Michael Larkin is the SLT line manager but hasn't been closely involved in this because
Glenn Chester has mainly been involving angela because of the second sight link.

Angela has kindly offered to prepare a brief as she has the background.
Mark - I've left you a message, it would be good to discuss. I'm happy to speak to martin's family and Glenn.

Hi both, just to let you know that I will brief the Board tomorrow am.

Mark/Ruth, important that if we get any coverage on Martin's death that you text me please as well as email.
Additionally, Kevin is getting some facts together for me so that I have whatever information is available to
hand.

Thanks in advance, Paula

Angela, thank you for sending over this news. I am so so sorry. Martin's family must be
devastated.

I know (sadly from experience in business and personally) that there is rarely a simple
explanation for such deaths; even though it is often easier for those so closely affected to look
for one.

Three requests: firstly if I can help in any way, that you or the team dealing with it ask me. I
would be happy to speak to or to meet the family if we thought that would help. Secondly, that
we look after them as much as we can and as they will allow; thirdly, that we look after Glenn:
he will be feeling very bad because he knew Martin and was the person closest to him from the
PO.

And then, we need to look to the business: to help me brief this properly to the Board, can you
let me know what background we have on Martin and how/why this might have happened. I had
heard but have yet to see a formal report, that there were previous mental health issues and
potential family issues. Also, if someone mentions the Post Office in a potential suicide case, I
would like to know what the process is for looking into it: can John and/or Hugh advise please?

Deeply sad.

As I write this, I see that Mark has asked similar questions. We need a single senior manager a
point person. Who is the SLT line manager please? Angela if it is you, and/or you would like it
to be, that is fine. but I am very aware that you are in need of a break after a tough couple of
weeks anyway. Can Kevin advise asap.

Thank you to everyone - I know you will be feeling as bad as I do over Martin's death.

Paula,

Sadly Martin Griffiths passed away this afternoon. Martin's sister notified Glenn Chester a
short while ago - the actual text is below in John's note below. Glenn has since spoken to
the sister - the tone of the conversation was fine with no animosity towards Glenn.

Angela,

To confirm our conversation, Glenn has spoken to Mr Griffiths sister to offer condolences
following the very sad news of Mr Griffiths having passed away this afternoon.

Glenn received notification of Mr Griffiths death by text earlier this evening from his sister
Jane (I think it was just before eight).

The text was worded — Sadly my brother Martin passed away this afternoon after being in
acoma for 18 days. The family is devastated as such as waste of life and feel the post
office has ruined yet another life. Thought you should know as you liked my brother.
Regards

John
