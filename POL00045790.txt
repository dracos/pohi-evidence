Calculation of the alleged theft

Background

As noted at paragraph 1.12 Mr Page has been charged with the theft af £282,000 in
sterling from Post Office Limited between March 2002 and January 2003,

Summary of alleged theft - 14 January 2003 audit report

An interval audit was undertaken at Rugeley Post-Office on 14 Seruary 2003 and a
shortfall of £282,000 was eventually identified ky the Post Office audit team,

The alleged theft of £282,000 relates to.a shortfall identified speci ficaily in the ‘Forzign
Currency Sterling Equivalent’ figure recorded in ihe “AM stock uait of Horizon, No
such cunency-was found by the audit tam during their audit, [understand that Mr Page
accepts that ne such amount of forcign currenvy was found at that time im Rugeley Post
Offive,

Mr Page denies thai the deficiency arose as'2 tesuit. of theft by him.

‘Inflation’ of the ‘Foreign Currency Sterling Equivalent’ figure in
Horizon

Exhibit MP/6. exhubted by Mr Patel ilusuates how the alleged deficiengy (or ‘inflation’
per Mr Patel) of £282,000 accumulated over time.

‘The inflation referred to by Mr Fatel is simply the difference between the “Foreign

Currer

cy on Hand’ Ggure-as recorded in Horizan by Rugeley Post Office and the ‘stenting
eyuivalent foreign currency on hand’ figure as identified from ‘the weekly Forde
Moneychanget*Conmmand 10° printouts.

Exhibit MP/6. shows that the first period where there was 4 Significant inflation in the
‘Foreign Curreney Sterling Equivalent’ figure in Elorizotr was in ihe week ended 26 Juric
2002 (Week 13) when ihe amount is said to be inated by £53,378 64.

Ip the two weeks ended. 3 and. 17 fuly 2902 (Veeks 14 and. 16) the Manton figure is
nvgative, One of the negative ‘inflation’ figures is esplained.as being tie result of typing

an incorrect tevaluation figure ina Horizon byt there 1 io apparent explanution for toe
other negative inflation figure ie. the week ended 3 July 2002 OWeek 14) This
demonstrates ihat as’ Torizen and the Fonic Moneychanger were not integrated,
differences could arise as a result of manual inpaltg errors,

The next significant inflation in the ‘Foreign Currency Sterling Equivalent’ figme is
shown in the week ended 31 July 2002 (Week 18) when the’ inflated figire per MPY6 is
£177,300, I have not seen a copy of the “Command 10’ printout for this period. It is not
clear t me whether it is alleged by the Prosecution that the theft by Mr Page hail reached
£177,500-by this date,

Exhibit MP/6 indicates: that, from’ the week crded 28 August 2002 (Veck 22), the
Horizon “Forcign Curency Sterling Equivalent’ Sgure was -inflated, initially’ by
£188,000. and increasing to £282,060 by the date of the intemal audit on 14 Jurmuary 2003

(Week 41},

How was the alleged theft concealed?

‘the Prosecution’s Opening Note states that cash, in sterling, wos stolen by Mi Page over
a period of time and, from the week ended 28 August 209? (Week 22). this was concealed
by Mr Page routinely inflating the Horizon computer records in -reletion. to foreign
currency held in the Rugeley Post Oflice “AM” stock unit.

I also note from the Prosecution’s Opening Note. that. some lime prior te Week 22. the
alleged the by Mr Page iy alleged to have been concvuled by overstating the amount of
Overnuht Cash Holdings’ CONCH") Jheid at Rugeley as. opposed to: ihe ‘Foreign

Thave seen no evidence regarding the alleged theft concealment via the “ONCH” figure,
inchiding a8 to how and when any such conccalment was undertaken prior to the -week
ended 28 August 2002 (Week.22). Lxipte that the Roval.Mail Ieitcy dated 22 February

Prior to Week 22

If it is alleged that by the week ended 31 fuly 2002 (Week 12) the thefl hed reached
£177,300, and that it wars boing concealed either by oversfating the true. loreign cunency
balance of the ‘ONCH’ figure. then. in my opinion, thete is an Uncaplained. meonststency
in the Prosecution s case as set out below’.

Firstly [ nete that in the two weeks ended 14 and 21 Aagast 2002 (Weeks 20 und 21), the
inflation figuras as stated by Mr Patel (see Exhibit MP/G) are nil,and therefore au
concealment is attributed 10 this item,

Secondly f note thai the recorded “CINCH figure (see Weekly Cash Avepumts) for the.two
weeks ended 14 and 21 August 2002 was only £79,819.00-and £91,240.69 respectively,
and therefiue they could riot be overstated by £177 500:

‘the Prosecution have not as. far as [ am aware offired any alternative explanations
regarding. methods of concealment other than the overstatement of the “ONCH’ or
‘Foreign Currency Sterling Equivalent’ figures m Horizon,

Seek 22 onwards

J agree with Mr Tatel-that as from the week. ended 28 August 200% (Week 22) the
Horizon ‘Foreign. Currency Sterling Fquivalent’ figure was inflated, intially by
£188,000, and iherecsing to £282,000 by the date of the audit on 14 January 2603 (Werk
4).

ihe ‘Command {0° prints have not been made available (and where according ti Mi Patel,
the figures were obtained rum Chesterfield),

Audit process

I have reviewed a copy of the: Veetir of decounts" section frormthe Audit Process Manual
(version dated 4° May 2002).

Further evidence of Mr Robert Davies — witiess statentent dated 18 February 2006

noit that the Prosecution have now provided further evidence in respect of the Jime

‘The shortfall identified at the time i¢ analysed as follows

Mr Davies now states that three cheques totalling £139400.00 (being cheques for
£80, 124.22, £49,689.44 and €9,.586.24 respectively) were meluded in the Week 13 Cash

Qu the basis of the aecounting evidence made availadle-to me, 1 agres with Mr Davies’
coaclusions that the two larger of the three cheques which he reters to should not have
been inclided in the Horizon account for the wock ended 26 June 2002 and henec the
shortage as calculated by the audit teum should be increased by £1.29,812.66 (280,124.22
plus £49,689.44),

1 would however note that itis not possible for me now to check whether or not the
amounts ‘verified’ at thé audit were correet as the audi process is largely one of simple
agset verification.

However, if the above iratter was the only “errur’.in the June 2062 audit then the revised

Summary and conclusions

My overall conclusiens

Jn suatimary I novt the follewing:

wind

Tagree with Mr Patel that as frem the week ended 2% August 2082 (Week 22) the
Honzon “Foreign Currency Sterling Equivalent’ figure way inflated, :nitially by
£138,000, and increasing to £282,000 by the date wf the audit on 14. January 2003
(Week 41)

TL agree with Mr Davies (witness statement dated 18 February 2006) that, on the
basis of the accounting evidence available, the shortage in the audit of 27 June
2002 should be increased by £129,813.66, and possibly hy a furrher £9 585.24;

‘The alleged deficiency of £282,900 in the ‘AM! siovk unit ar 4 Januery 2003
dacs not necessarily indicate theft by Mr Page’~ any such shortfall could in
practice be the result of other unidentified ervors‘or differences in Horizon.

It ts implicit in the Prosecution’s case that, vy. simply stating that the £282,000
shortfall in the ‘AM stouk unit equates to-9 theft of the same amount, all other
figures in Honzon (except for the differences identified at the audit) were carteet,
T have: seen ad evidenee that this us’ fhe ease und would ‘also noie the bigh
incidence of ‘errors’ a8 set out in Section 5.7.

‘The Prosecution rely on the assumption that the figures in Horizon we those
reourded by Rugeley Post Ofice statt themselves and that the ‘Horizon’ system
was working corrcetly throughout the indictment period:

It is now mnt possible to establish whether the declared ‘ONCH" figures were
conectly reearded in Horizon as they were not independently checked at the time
other thgn at the two audits;

{f it is alleged that by the week ended 31 July 2002 (Week 18) the the A had
reached £177,500, and thot it was being concealed vither by overstating the toue
foreign currency balance or the ‘ONCH(’ figure, then. in ty opinion. there is an

unexplamed incunsisiency if the Prosecution's ease, This is beomuse jn the two
weeks ended 14 and 21 August 2002 (Weeks'20 and 21). the inflation figures as
stated by Mr Patel are nul and the regarded *QNCH? figures were only £79.810.00
