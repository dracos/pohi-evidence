POST OFFICE LIMITED -v- ALISON HENDERSON
NORWICH MAGISTRATES’ COURT - 7™ OCTOBER 2010
CASE: POLTD/0910/0167

The committal papers have been approved and served on the Defence Solicitors and Court. A
copy has been supplied to my Agents who have been instructed to conduct the committal
proceedings. The original statements have also been provided to my Agents and they have been
asked to hand them to the Court. Please send either directly to my Agents the original witness
statements or, indeed, take them to Court on 7" October, so that this matter can be committed.

I have signed the schedule of non-sensitive unused material on the basis that there is no
material which undermines the prosecution case. If any material of this nature does come to
light then please contact me immediately.

The current charge covers a period from 1* January 1997 to 10" February 2010. Is there any
indication from the Horizon documentation, the defendant's bank statements, or any other
material, when this money first went missing? Can you confirm when the last audit took place so
that if necessary that date can actually appear in the indictrnent?

At the moment I suspect that this will be a case where Horizon itself is challenged and, as such,
the prosecution will be under pressure to disclose a huge amount of Horizon data. It would
therefore be extremely useful if we could identify something that assists the prosecution in the
pursuit of this criminal allegation.
