0.7 Glossary

Term Definition

Business Continuity I This document, which has been generated to satisfy the requirement for a Service

Framework Continuity Framework.
At a working level, Post Office Limited and Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail Group
Account) generally recognise the term Business Continuity as having three closely
related components: resilience, contingency and recovery

Resilience May be defined as the steps taken to avert a loss of service or disaster or reduce
the likelihood of a disaster or loss of service.

Contingency May be defined as the interim processes and procedures adopted during the loss of
service.

Recovery May be defined as the business and technical arrangements to restore a lost
system or service and manage the process of reversion to normal processing and
full resumption of service

0.8 Changes Expected

Changes

Further changes may be identified following the introduction of HNG-X services and testing

It is unclear if SU/MAN/018, the Core Services Horizon Operational Procedures Front End Index, will be revised
for HNG-X documentation or replaced by a new HNG-X Operational Procedures Front End Index.

0.9 Accuracy

Not applicable

0.10 Security Risk Assessment

Security risks have been assessed and it is considered that there are no security risks relating specifically to this
document.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1. Introduction

A key requirement in the Royal Mail Group Account solution is that of business continuity i.e.
ensuring there are operational processes and procedures in place to ensure that any component
failure has minimal effect on the services provided.

This will cover failures in the core Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail Group Account) services e.g.
DCOS, BNS and the underlying services e.g., NBS, TPS, APS, etc, support services and client
services where appropriate.

A principle requirement specified within schedule B2 of The Agreement is the provision of
Business Continuity Plans which conform to an overall ‘Service Continuity Framework’.

It is the objective of this document and associated Business Continuity Plans to satisfy that
requirement and Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail Group Account) and Post Office Limited have
agreed that the title of this document should be ‘Business Continuity Framework’.

Specifically this document will cover the following areas.

a) Provide a baseline definition of the Business Continuity Framework and Business Continuity
Plans as specified in Schedule B2.

b) Provide a detailed definition of Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail Group Account) deliverables
associated with business continuity and the methods of review and assurance.

C) Define the contents and format of the Business Continuity Plans.
d) Define the overall test strategy adopted for testing of the Business Continuity Plans.

¢) Define the management processes for the management of Major Business Continuity

Incidents.

Figure 1 Service Elements

3.1.1 Business Continuity Plans

There shall be four Continuity Plans for HNG-X:
HNG-X Services Business Continuity Plan
HNG-X Support Services Business Continuity Plan
HNG-X Security Business Continuity Plan
HNG-X Engineering Service Business Continuity Plan

During the HNG-X counter phase, e.g. where branches are being rolled-out with HNG-X
counters, the HNG-X Business Continuity plans will define the applicable sections of the Horizon
Services Business Continuity Plans that support the services and infrastructure being utilised in
Bootle and Wigan to support Horizon counters.

The contents of the Business Continuity Plans are specified within Schedule B2. All plans must
be of the document type Business Continuity Plan and shall contain Continuity Plan within the
title. Each plan shall have a specified owner. (Further details in section 8)

The Business Continuity Plans shall be based on impact and risk assessments as agreed by
Fujitsu Services and Post Office. Such assessments shall be reviewed when agreed by the
Parties, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

FUJITSU Framework

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

The Business Continuity Plans shall include without limitation the following:
prevention measures;
preparedness measures;
contingency measures;
recovery of normal service;
contact lists.
The major elements of the plans are as follows.

3.1.1.1 Risk Analysis and Service Impact

Each Business Continuity Plan will identify all potential risks in terms of likelihood and service
impact.

Once an incident occurs which has a service continuity impact, there must be a mechanism in
place to assess the impact of the incident and the possible effect(s) it will have on the end to end
service. This is fairly complex and will be dependant upon time of day and therefore will be a
real-time process i.e. the impact of the service failure at 2am will be different from the impact at
8pm. However, a high-level impact statement will be included in the relevant Business
Continuity Plan.

3.1.1.2 Escalation Contacts

Each Business Continuity Plan will contain escalation routes in conformance to Cross-Domain
Business Continuity management processes.

3.1.1.3 Resilience Strategy documents

Each Business Continuity Plan will contain, where appropriate, references to the underlying
resilience strategy document and/or technical design documents.

3.1.1.4 Contingency Procedures
Each Business Continuity Plan will contain a section defining contingency actions.

From an operational perspective contingency actions are documented in a number of places,
depending upon the severity of the service element failure.

1, Within operational procedures, subordinate to SU/MAN/018 (NB: this reference is subject to
change). Where appropriate the Business Continuity Plan will make reference to the relevant
operations manual.

2, Where appropriate, contingency actions are documented within the Action column of the Risk
Analysis (and service impact) section of each plan.

3, Where appropriate, for potential MBCIs and MBCI contingency actions are documented in the
contingency section of each plan.

3.1.2 Service Framework

The BCF shall be defined in terms of services rather than components of infrastructure. The
definitions of the services that are a subject of the BCF are defined in this document.

Section 4 contains details of the service elements and components together with their
relationship to each of the Business Continuity Plans.

3.1.3 Business Continuity Management Process

The resolution of incidents will be dealt with through the standard Service Desk Incident
Management process.

In the event of a Major Business Continuity Incident there will be a need for controlled and co-
ordinated activity across Royal Mail Group Account and Post Office Limited. (See section 5)

3.1.4 Test strategy and plans

The test schedule and method will be defined as a separate document (REF 3) and will be
referred to within the Business Continuity Plans. The overall high-level strategy will be defined in
this document for agreement. (See section 6)

3.1.5 Review strategy

A review strategy defines the joint review mechanism prior to acceptance and also the review
mechanism of the processes following acceptance. This is defined in a later section for
agreement. (See section 7)

3.1.6 Deliverables and Acceptance Methods

Section 9 defines the deliverables required to satisfy the Business Continuity requirements of
Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail Group Account).

Also included in that section is the method of acceptance planned for each deliverable.

5 Business Continuity Management Process

An incident is an unplanned occurrence that adversely impacts upon the normal service in
some important way. The scale of the event can range from a minor fault to a major outage
e.g.:

Minor incident e.g. HNG-x counter failure affecting service at an individual Branch.

Major incident e.g. loss of the Active HNG-X Data-centre, outage of key back-end system
affecting service at all Branches.

The resolution of minor incidents will be dealt with through the standard Service Desk
Incident Management process.

Major Business Continuity Incidents will have a significant impact upon Post Office Limited.
In such cases there will be a need for controlled and co-ordinated activity across supplier
organisations and Post Office Limited. Consequently all Major Business Continuity Incidents
will be managed via the ‘Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail Group Account) Customer Service
Business Continuity Management’ process (REF 17) and the Post Office Limited and Fujitsu
Services Business Continuity Interface Agreement (REF 16). These documents support the
immediate escalation of major incidents to a Cross Domain Business Continuity Management
Team (BCMT). The BCMT consists of operational managers from each organisation.

6 Test Strategy and Plans

6.1 Requirements
6.1.1 Schedule B2 requires that:

‘The Business Continuity Plans shall include a testing strategy with two distinct parts
) Initial testing before commencement of Roll-Out of Services

b) Regular testing’

6.1.2 Unless agreed otherwise in accordance with paragraph 6.1.3 below, the Business Continuity
Services shall in respect of any new service introduced through the Change Control
Procedure:

include the performance of substantially the same business continuity tests as are
described in this Business Continuity Framework prior to the introduction of that new
service; and

include any specific business continuity tests agreed by the Parties.

6.1.3. The tests referred to in paragraph 6.1.2 above shall be conducted with the business continuity
tests conducted for the infrastructure supporting the Applicable Services and scheduled in
accordance with working practice for the Applicable Services. The frequency of and method
used for all business continuity tests shall be documented in the document entitled "Business
Continuity Test Plan" (SVM/SDM/PLA/0003).

Business continuity tests to be carried out under this Business Continuity Framework may be
cancelled or rescheduled and/or the method used for a test may be varied for operational
business reasons by agreement in writing between Post Office and Fujitsu Services (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld).

6.2 Initial Testing

6.2.1 Existing Services.

Initial Business Continuity testing was conducted prior to the full operational introduction of
the Horizon Service (Core System Release) and the subsequent release of major services,
e.g. MBS, NBS and ETS services. Test reports have been produced for this testing and are
maintained in PVCS within the CS/REP/nnn documentation work-set.

6.2.2 New Services

Where services are introduced for HNG-X the Test Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0003), (REF3) will
be revised to include the Business Continuity testing of those services and define when the
initial testing will be conducted.

For HNG-X SVM/SDM/PLA/003 defines the Test Plan and provides cross reference to the
test scripts which have been produced for the Business Continuity initial testing.

The level and schedule of testing is dependent upon operational constraints and is
accomplished by a mix of operational tests and procedural walk-through. Where involvement

Note 1: These operational tests are subject to agreement as performing all of the tests will
result in the breach of the 10 days of operational testing in the IRE19 as defined in
the HNG-X Data-centre Operations Service Description. Intra test plan sampling will
be performed for each of BC16, 22 and 26. Inter-test plan sampling will be performed
across BFS, 8, 12, 19, 20, 22, 25.

Note 2: The HNG-X Data-centre Operations operational testing assumes there is access to
LST counters and client simulators.

All other business continuity test details, e.g., for the transition phase, will be defined within
the Business Continuity Test Plan REF3 where the type of test and frequency of testing shall
be specified. The Fujitsu Services (RMGA) Business Continuity Manager will be responsible
for the planning of the other on-going tests, i.e. those not defined in table 2, and will co-
ordinate and schedule activity as appropriate with the Post Office Limited Business
Continuity Manager and suppliers.

7 Review Strategy

A Business Continuity Steering Group has been established between Post Office Limited and
Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail Group Account). This group reviews the progress of each
release against the Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail Group Account) delivery and acceptance
plans. It also facilitates the co-ordination of joint development review and assurance
activities where necessary. This forum also provides an objective feed into the release
authorisation process for new releases.

This team, or subset of the team, reviews all aspects of business continuity on an ongoing
basis, during Live Trials and beyond. The remit of the team is to continually look at ways of
improving cross-domain business continuity processes.

8 Business Continuity Plans

8.1

8.2

8.3

Throughout section 8, the use of /talics denotes the actual words in Schedule B2.

‘The Business Continuity Plans shall be based on impact and risk assessments and agreed
by Fujitsu Services and Post Office ..... 7

Ownership of Plans
‘Ownership of all contingency actions shall be identified in the Business Continuity Plans.

Each Business Continuity Plan will clearly state the owner of the plan who is responsible for
the definition, maintenance, testing and review of the plan.

In addition to this, the Fujitsu Services (RMGA) Business Continuity Manager will have
overall responsibility for the development, co-ordination and integration where appropriate of
all Business Continuity Plans and providing Post Office Limited with a single point of contact.

Plan Activation

‘The Business Continuity Plans shall include activation procedures and time periods within
which the contingency measures shall be activated.’

Where appropriate Business Continuity Plans will contain a risk and impact assessment for
both the core post office day (08:00 to 20:00) and the non-core post office day (20:00 to
08:00). (See 8.3). For services where the impact of the service element failure is common
throughout the day, a single risk and impact assessment will be documented.

Alternatively, a single risk statement may be documented throughout the day in the risk table.
The Critical Time Factors (CTF) here shall be determined by the criticality of the service
activity. I.e. for on-line service, e.g. NBS and DCS the CTF is identified against Post Office
Core Day processing, whilst for file transfers, e.g. APS and TPS the CTF is identified against
Post Office Non-Core Day processing. The risk assessment identifies the critical time periods
for activation of contingency measures and identifies the associated contingency actions.

Impact and Risk Assessment

‘The Business Continuity Plans shall be based on impact and risk assessments by Fujitsu
Services and Post Office...’

Contained within each service are a number of critical components, the failure of which
would cause a potential service disruption. Consideration shall also be given to the impact
arising from the loss of building or staff. Each of these critical components and the
associated failure scenarios will be identified and documented within a risk and impact matrix
within the Business Continuity Plan. This matrix is used as a tool to present in a tabular form
all risks identified with a service together with the impact of that risk occurring, the time after
which that impact becomes critical, and the contingency actions to be taken.

Associated with each of the above elements are impact statements, which will define the
likely business impacts of failure of the critical components. To aid in the definition of these,
each Business Continuity Plan, where appropriate, will contain a schematic defining the
operational day for that particular service. SLA liabilities will be used as an aid in determining
business impact. Where the impact triggers either a Potential MBCI or an MBCI, the
appropriate action will be identified from within the matrix.

Associated with the impact statement will be a reference to the specific recovery and
contingency procedures required.

8.4

8.4.1

Business impact assessment will be reviewed jointly with Post Office Limited and will be
subject to ongoing review.

The combination of risk and impact will also determine the level of ongoing testing that will
form part of the testing strategy.
Other Requirements
‘The Business Continuity Plan shall include, without limitation, the following
a) Prevention measures
b) Preparedness measures
C) Contingency measures
d) Recovery of normal service

) Contacts list’

In addition to the above the plans shall include details of the individual services, references
to the relevant operations manual and references to the underlying resilience strategy
document and/or technical design documents, where appropriate.

Preventative Measures

Preventative measures are defined as those measures that are in place to prevent service
continuity failures in the first place. There are two aspects that are considered.

8.4.1.1.1 Technical Design

A key element of the design of the service is the elimination of single points of failure and the
ability to fail-over to contingency infrastructure, e.g., an alternative live BladeFrame image,
an alternative network circuit, and thereby recover the service in a timely manner.

This capability is documented in a number of technical design documents, which in turn are
referenced within the relevant Business Continuity Plans.

From an HNG-X service perspective IRE11 is the active data-centre and IRE19 is intended
to be used as a HNG-X disaster recovery data-centre and only invoked for major incidents,
e.g., fire, flooding. Note from a network perspective IRE11 and IRE19 will be used in a
live/live mode of operation.

8.4.1.1.2 Security

Plans and processes will be established to comply with the Business Continuity requirements
of 1SO27001 and SVM/SDM/POL/0032.

Another preventative measure is the denial of access to the service to anyone who may wish
to deliberately cause disruption. Although not mentioned specifically within Business
Continuity Plans, this requirement is met through general conformance to Access Control
Policy and the Security Functional Specification.

The Security Business Continuity plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0031) has been produced to meet the
requirements of ISO 27001 and should be used in conjunction with the HNG-X Services,
Support Services (SVM/SDM/PLA/0001) and Engineering Services (SVM/SDM/PLA/0030)
business continuity plans.

8.1.2 Preparedness Measures
Preparedness measures are implemented in a number of ways:

a) The provision of risk and impact assessments, along with references to
appropriate recovery and contingency procedures will allow appropriate actions
to be carried out in a pre-prepared manner.

b) Initial technical testing and the operational testing of Business Continuity Plans
will ensure all activation of the Business Continuity Plans will have been carefully
rehearsed.

c) Joint process and procedure walk-through will, as above, ensure all Cross-

Domain (multi-party) Business Continuity processes are tested thoroughly.

8.1.3 Contingency Measures

Contingency measures may be defined as the actions to be performed in the event of a
service break to enable business impact to be minimised during the service outage prior to
recovery being completed.

Contingency measures will include the recognition, activation, incident management and
initiation of recovery procedures. These will be documented within the Business Continuity
Plan and also as references to supporting documentation.

An example of contingency measures is failing over the host server in the event of the prime
server experiencing a failure.

8.1.4 Recovery of Normal Service

These procedures will be mainly of a technical operational nature and will mainly refer to
technical procedures defined within the Fujitsu Services (Core Services) Operational
Procedures Manual REF 15. There may be references to other activities that may impact
across service boundaries. Where appropriate these will be referenced within the plan.

8.1.5 Contact List

Each Business Continuity Plan will document the contacts for initial contact and technical
liaison where appropriate, together with details of escalation contacts. This will be in
accordance with the Business Continuity Management process.

9.1.1

9.1.2

9.1.3

9.1.4

Introduction

This section defines the deliverables required to satisfy the Business Continuity requirements
of Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail Group Account).

Also included within this section is the method of acceptance planned for each deliverable.

Methodologies used in the acceptance process include those identified below:

Joint Review

Joint review is by circulation of, discussion about and agreement upon the structure and
content of a document by Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail Group Account) and Post Office
Limited.

Document Inspection

Formal inspection of a paper copy, by Post Office Limited, of a commercially sensitive (i.e.
technical design) or Service Provider (i.e. Fujitsu Services Core Services) operational
document, by the appropriate reviewing authorities, whilst under supervision by the document
owner. No paper or electronic copies must be taken. Objective of this process is to verify the
existence of the document; no approval rights are associated with this activity.

Inspection to take place at the premises of the document owner.

Procedural Walkthrough

A paper based technique whereby a scenario is selected and the actions and procedures of
those Service Delivery Units (SDU) impacted followed through to ensure that both individual
service delivery unit procedures, and cross boundary SDU procedures, are both complete
and fully integrated. Where appropriate, i.e. affecting Post Office Limited services, Post
Office Limited will be invited to procedural walkthroughs.

Operational Test

An exercise using live operational service components, or where more appropriate and
agreed by Post Office Limited a test environment, whereby a scenario is selected and the
actions and procedures of those Service Delivery Units (SDU) impacted are followed
through. This is to ensure that both individual service delivery unit procedures, and cross
boundary SDU procedures are both complete and fully integrated, and that the desired
outcome on the operational service components is achieved. This is then followed by the
total regression of any changes made to the live service components.

An example of live operational functionality testing was the Campus Fail-over test that was
conducted during CSR Live Trial. An example of a business continuity operational test in a
test environment is the verification of recovery procedures for the Reference Data RDT Host.
