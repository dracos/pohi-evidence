[NIC]

In order to succeed, we need to follow three stages: Foundations, Growth and Sustainability.

We are currently working on building the foundations of the people plan to assess where we are and where we want to be.
There are 3 stages rather than years - we are at the Foundation stage for a number of activities and moving into Growth with
others

Each People Operational lead has submitted a detailed people plan for their area with key Period & Quarterly events, as we
build a picture of the current core work and change work planned for each of the People Teams.

The People Plan will ensure that we can efficiently keep on top of key events and priorities, and challenge any deviations. We
need to ensure that we are all aligned to business and People strategy, and that we are effective at communicating the valuable
work the People Team do day in and day out, and the remarkable improvements we are making business wide, to enable the
success of The People Plan.
