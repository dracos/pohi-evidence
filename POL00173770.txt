Just got this — v odd.
Ruth is talking to Portland now.
Everyone aware of Telegraph piece.

Let me know if George comes back —I really hope we can stop this at the outset and persuade the NFSP it’s in their
interests to go back and say we don’t want to do prog — rather than have us get involved.

Thank

This never was funny but is now beyond a joke!

We really need Portland to earn their money now with some innovative and interesting ways of getting us back on
front foot. I'm not sure what we've had from them.

We need some other voices in this. The journalism is appalling.

Are you ok with the telegraph stuff? I know the deputy editor as a mate and can intervene but can only that card
when really needed. What is Portland advice re telegraph?

We will need to warn Paula and others about telegraph piece in advance.
Give me a call if you like

Hi both — Matt has been contacted by a producer at BBC Panorama (contact details below),
which is considering running a programme on the Horizon / Justice for subpostmasters
issue.

To inform their decision on whether to run with the programme or not, he’s keen to talk to
someone at the NFSP in more detail about our take on the issue, and about our experience
of Horizon more broadly.

I don't feel confident enough in my knowledge of the system to do this. Therefore, would
one of you be willing to talk to him?

I understand from Matt that he'd ideally like to talk to us today or tomorrow.
