8 Process Models for HSH and NBSC Interaction

Four process diagrams are shown on the following pages. The first two relate to the HSH.
The third and fourth relate to the NBSC. The diagrams show the interfaces between the HSH
& NBSC and how those interfaces are expected to work in support of business as usual
activity.

The process diagrams include:

(a) an anti-call-bouncing link which prevents callers being passed backwards and forwards
between the two desks,

(b) anew “hot line” (not yet implemented) between team leaders on the HSH and NBSC to
facilitate the agreement of a way forward when attempted call transfers between the two
desks fail.

The process diagrams assume that:

(C) there is a well defined list of appropriate incidents for both desks, which accommodate
new unexpected incident types,

(d) the desk transferring an incident closes their incident when the other desk accepts the
transfer.

(e) The MIS systems associated with the NBSC and HSH will record the correct incident
type for incidents that are accepted via the anti-call-bouncing agreement.

(f) The performance of the ant- call bouncing agreement will be reviewed at the Helpdesk
Review forum to ensure the agreement does not impact on the contract

On the following four process diagrams only the sub-processes listed below relate directly to
this Interface Agreement. The other sub-processes shown on the diagrams and their
interactions are included for information purposes and may be subject to change solely at the
discretion of ICL Pathway (sub-processes with prefix H) and Post Office (sub-processes
prefix N).

Processes relating directly to this interface agreement include:

H1, HS, H10, H11, H12, H13, H18, H19, H20, H21, H22, H23.

NI, N2, N10, N11, N12, N13, N18, N19, N20, N21, N22, N23.
