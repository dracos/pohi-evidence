Just a quick update to say that we have found a problem with the query and we are double checking that there are no
more.
The re-assuring news is that there is no evidence of missing JSNs.

Hello
We have provided some files to Huddle, the platform we are using with POL to share data.
The 3 files uploaded are:

- Summary sheet showing the 25 new ‘ARQ’ sets of data sampled, and from the 25 we sampled, the 4 which
had gaps. (“Analyticl_GapsinSessionID_Sample25”)

- _ List of all JSN gaps from the 25 new ‘ARQ’ sets of data. (“Analytic1_MissingJSNs”)

- Detailed example of 1 ARQ file requested based on missing Session ID’s in original data provided, with our
formulas in there so you can see where the gaps in JSN are (where the final column is greater than 1 after the
JSN have been ordered). (“Project_Sparrow”)

Hello Torstein,

Just to check we are on the same page, we’ve taken onboard the fact that the session IDs are not
necessarily continuous, but that the JSNs are. My comments below are focused on the fact that the
new data, centred on JSNs, also has gaps in the sequencing. Given this seems too fundamental to the
correct operation of the system to possibly be true, I felt that there must still be a filter applied, and
picked out the italicised text from one of your previous emails which might support this:

“The explanation is that it is the JSN (journal sequence number) that is guaranteed to increase by
exactly one — i.e. no gaps. The JSN is used for more than just basket identifiers and so the gaps in the
Sessionld are explained by instances where the JSN has been used against something other than a
basket to record a block of data in the audit trail. In the specific example that I looked at the ‘missing’
JSN was used to record assembling a pouch in the branch.

The extract that was produced for this ARQ confirmed that there were no gaps or duplicates i in the .

I’ve highlighted the key sentence in yellow. Does this account for the gaps in the new data?

Sorry if you already had grasped all of the above and your below email remains pertinent, but felt it
worth double checking that you were aware we’re now focused on the new data centred on JSN,
because as far as we can see there are definitely gaps!

Mark,

There are no gaps in JSNs from my analysis.

I will have another go at providing the explanation when I back to my laptop - probably tomorrow.

A key point, which I had missed previously is that the session ID which you have looked at in your analysis is not based
on JSN, so any gaps in session ID does not imply any gap in JSNs. The completeness of the sequence of JSNs for each
ARQ is confirmed on the Summary sheet in the spreadsheet.

Hello Torstein,
Thanks for the response below.
We have reviewed the response below and gone back over all evidence received on this analytic. In summary:

- The original Huddle data was used for Analytic 1 ‘gaps in transaction logs’. Gaps were found however further
investigation noted the analytic was ran on Session ID, not JSN as per description below. As such we obtained
new data including JSN field.

- New data for the specific instances where gaps were found was provided, this included the JSN field.

- We have re-ran the analytic and still found gaps in the JSN using this data (you can see gaps by simply
filtering A-Z in the JSN column.

o For example on sheet 403 (which you provided in the below email) the JSN numbers include 166762,
166765, however omit 166763 & 166764. There are many other gaps.
FUJ00157889
FUJ00157889

o We have also re-reviewed the full new dataset provided (i.e. all the new ARQ data) and have found
many gaps throughout. We had a detailed look at one sheet (REF: POIA4329B, BranchID: 223644) and
again noted many gaps in JSN (631447 — 631451)

- This causes concern as per your statement below there should be no JSN gaps “ this is explicitly confirmed as
part of the standard extract process — for each counter included in the extract we show the lowest message
number (JSN) and the highest message number and confirm there are no gaps and no duplicates.”

- Are you able to advise on a reason for these gaps? You noted someway below that

“The explanation is that it is the JSN (journal sequence number) that is guaranteed to increase by
exactly one — i.e. no gaps. The JSN is used for more than just basket identifiers and so the gaps in the
Sessionid are explained by instances where the JSN has been used against something other than a
basket to record a block of data in the audit trail. In the specific example that I looked at the ‘missing’
JSN was used to record assembling a pouch in the branch.

The extract that was produced for this ARQ confirmed that there were no gaps or duplicates in the
JSN sequence on the summary page; checking this is part of the standard extract process. However,
the data that is output to the spreadsheet is tailored to provide specific pertinent data.”

- Ifthe above holds true for the gaps in JSN noted above, are you able to advise how we can evidence this?

Currently these gaps in the JSN sequencing feel so fundamental to the correct operation of the Horizon system, that I
suspect there is still some kind of filter being applied to the data (especially given your commentary in the
penultimate bullet above), as the alternative would be fatal to all previous understanding and assurance over the
system.

Subject: RE: Bramble:

Lewis,

As indicated in my response of February 1% I promised I would check the ‘5’ you noted in the JSN/Session Id
comparison. I’m afraid I now have to grovel as my explanation of how the session number is generated was wrong — I
had jumped to a conclusion from a small sample of data. The integrity of the audit trail is not affected by my error, but
1am embarrassed nevertheless.

In fact the session number is generated using the USN (not the JSN). The definitions from DES/APP/HLD/0083 are
pasted below

JSN Journal Sequence Number. Every auditable message from the counter to
the BAL (e.g. settlement) will have a JSN associated with it.

FUJ00157889
FUJ00157889

Session Id / SSN Each Basket will have a unique Session Id associated with it. Session Ids
have the property that they contain a number that is always increasing for a
given counter.

Note: Session Ids are held “Mod 1,000,000” and so they can occasionally
wrap around to zero. This needs to be taken into account when comparing
values

USN The USN is a Unique Sequence Number managed by the Counter Business
Application for systems that require one. One is allocated by the counter for
each recoverable transaction. Its presence defines the transaction as
recoverable.

Note USNs are not used exclusively for recovery (e.g. Postage Labels)

From DES/APP/IFS/0018

Wy

horizonTxld Transactions id of the form “O0-“ + branch accounting code +

counter id + “-“ + usn

The JSN is the number that must have the property of incrementing by exactly 1 to demonstrate that no auditable
messages between counter and the central systems have been lost or inserted.

You will see from the ‘Summary’ sheet on the ARQs that this is explicitly confirmed as part of the standard extract
process — for each counter included in the extract we show the lowest message number (JSN) and the highest
message number and confirm there are no gaps and no duplicates.

There is no need for Session Id’s to demonstrate the same property as they are derived from a different source.
I have asked our support team to regenerate a couple of the ‘JSN’ queries to show the Sessionld (where there is one)

and attach these for information. These queries give a pretty good overview of the activities that took place at each
counter. Other, more specific queries, drill into the detail.

Lewis,
Pete asked me to respond on the ‘new’ ARQ questions.

- Much fewer columns in ‘new’ ARQ data
This is a new query written specifically to show that all the JSNs are accounted for. In my view the query does that —
when you find ‘gaps’ in the original query you are able to confirm that the JSN was used for some other purpose (and
FUJ00157889
FUJ00157889

what that purpose was).

- ‘Time’ column called something different in both & also has a different time format.
The names given to columns are specified in the query used and I did not specify that the column name had to be
identical in this new query; we could obviously do this but I don’t think it would add value.

-  JSN & SessionID column are called different things, and in the New extract this column seems to be prefixed
with a ‘5’. I don’t think the different format for time should be an issue — Excel may well have decided to
present it in a prettier way; if the values were different then that would be an issue.

As above on the column names; as this query is looking at JSNs specifically I would argue that JSN is the appropriate
heading. The previous extract it is appropriate to use Session!D as that has more meaning to the POL Business as a
‘session’ means something to a SubPostmaster whereas it is unlikely they would warm to the more technical
terminol The JSN i di structing the SessionID.

Finally I can assure you that the data in the new queries has been extracted from the same source with all the
checking of digital signatures and other safeguards that we have explained in the past.

Elena,
Please find attached my explanation of the Analytic 6 observations as promised.

As you will be aware all of these observations relate to the now retired Horizon system and so we no longer have the
audit data for a number of them. The Mails application at the time was a package which was integrated into the main
Horizon system. The package was not written by Fujitsu.
FUJ00157889
FUJ00157889

It appears that on occasion the Mails package wrote records to the audit file which missed technical detail but there
is no reason to think this would have affected the postmasters’ accounts as far as I can see. Obviously we cannot
recreate the scenarios discussed in the attachment as we don’t have the facilities to run the old software.

I cannot give guidance on whether further work should be done looking at other modes as it depends on what Post
Office is trying to achieve.

From my perspective the exercise using SC has identified a small number of instances where we can see that the
data from the audit trail has not been extracted by the extract tool, and I am finalising a response on that which will
explain the glitch. I am comfortable that for all the cases identified to date we can see detail in the audit trail which
shows what items were sold in the branch for each session in mode SC (Serve Customer).

Torstein,

The analytic was designed to look at imbalances with session ids under mode ‘SC’. For those cases as I mentioned
below all the cases fall into your buckets of a) being relatively small and b) being negative.

If we want to look at session ids with all modes then I will have to re-design the analytic (and I don’t know what the
results will look like) and this is what I am asking whether it’s something you want us doing or not to help with your

To answer your question below - with the analytic performed on the session ids with ‘SC’ mode, all the imbalances are
relatively small and negative.

If we want to include the full population, I believe there were bigger imbalances involved but I will have to re-run the

We have discussed internally and to get the assurance we need on this, we propose the below approach, let
us know you thoughts:

Deloitte to select a sample of 25 session ids identified with gaps and share them with you and for those
respective ARQs to get the additional transactions for that month (i.e. the session ids that don’t hit the
basket) to verify the completeness of JSNs? Will that work from your side?

Elena,

Now I am back from leave I have had a look at the query about ‘missing sessions’ that you raised in your
email of 30" November (analytic 1). I looked specifically at the example

M126\ARQ 247\01-31 Aug 2011.xls 151306

The explanation is that it is the JSN (journal sequence number) that is guaranteed to increase by exactly one —
i.e. no gaps. The JSN is used for more than just basket identifiers and so the gaps in the SessionId are
explained by instances where the JSN has been used against something other than a basket to record a block of
data in the audit trail. In the specific example that I looked at the ‘missing’ JSN was used to record assembling
a pouch in the branch.

The extract that was produced for this ARQ confirmed that there were no gaps or duplicates in the JSN
sequence on the summary page; checking this is part of the standard extract process. However, the data that is
output to the spreadsheet is tailored to provide specific pertinent data.

T attach the raw data for JSN 11425.

On the call we had previously, one of the agreed actions for analytic 1 (Identify gaps in audit log sequencing) was to
test whether the session ids have gaps between them instead of the combination of session ids and transaction ids we
used previously.

Therefore, we re-designed the analytic to look at gaps in session ids only, but we still found gaps between them.

I have attached 5 example cases and I also copied the data from their raw files on the respective tabs highlighting
where the issue is. Torstein/Pete, can you please have a look on the attached to check whether this is something
you’d expect or whether we are missing anything? Could it be branches with multiple stock units?

Kind Regards,
Elena

Hi Torstein,
FUJ00157889
FUJ00157889

Thanks for sending the below information through for analytic 6. We took that into account and re-
performed the reconciliation.

Please note that this is work in progress but there are still 40 session ids that don’t balance —I am attaching
the top 15.

Would it be possible to have a look at these please as it might help us identify another cause of this?

Finally we were advised by the case handlers to perform this exercise on the ‘SC’ mode only, is that your
understanding too?

Kind Regards,
Elena

Thanks Torstein.

That would appear to likely explain it. Should hopefully be a simple job for the data team to revise
their analytic to account for and check this explains those 59 cases.

Thanks,

All,
My curiosity got the better of me and I asked our support team to redo the first two ARQs on the Analytics 6 sheet.
FUJ00157889
FUJ00157889

In both cases I get the session to balance to zero — as it should.

What looks likely here is that the basket was not fully captured in the analysis as the size of the ARQ extends to two
sheets in Excel — this was set up in the days when you could only get 60,000 or so rows ona sheet; in both cases there

are entries for the basket (Sessionld) on the both sheets. In both cases the values on Sheet 1 sum to the Balance
shown on the Analytic 6 summary.

Hope this helps resolution. The attachment lists all of the records I found.

Regards etc.

Dear all,

Here are the agreed actions arising out of this morning's (slightly delayed) call:

Analytic 4

In light of Torstein’s explanation that transaction IDs do not need to be continuous, whereas session IDs contain the

last few digits of JSNs and therefore should be continuous, Deloitte are going to check whether there are any gaps in
the session IDs.

Deloitte to arrange a walkthrough to observe/verify the effect of a branch deleting a transaction on the Branch
Database.

Analytic 6

In the first instance Kath is going to review the data in respect of the 15 samples identified by Deloitte and look for any
patterns (e.g. transactions that are common to every example). That will inform next steps.

One option might be for Fujitsu to re-extract data for audit trail, although everyone expects that the data will be the
same as that previously extracted.

If no patterns are identified and data is the same on re-extraction, we may be in genuine exception territory. However
Deloitte could attempt validation by reviewing documents in relation to Legacy Horizon.

Please let me know if I've missed anything and thanks again for your time.
Kind regards

Jonny
