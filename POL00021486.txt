Gordon Steele presented the Board with a paper on debit and
credit card acceptance. The Board noted the paper, and in
particular that:

foreign exchange transactions were conducted in Post Office. *
Ltd branches in: partnership with: First Rate Travel Services
(FRTS), a joint venture between Bank of Ireland and Post Office
Ltd;

Post Office Ltd had offered card payment for foreign exchange
transactions for 8 years via a system provided by Natwest.
Changes to banking rules now required mandatory conversion
to the Chip and PIN system. Consequently, Natwest were
unwilling to supply this service beyond November 2005 without
changes to the infrastructure to include ‘pin-pads' and Chip and
PIN capability;

IT development was proposed as part of the planned Horizon
S90 software release, planned for October 2005;

the total investment was £4.3m (£3.0m from FRTS and £1.3m
from Post Office Ltd).

The Board agreed to the investment of £4.3m subject to the

successful conclusion to the negotiations with FRTS to ensure
a £3m contribution.

products for 2004/05 Year to, Date Period 7: The Board noted
. the report.

POLB04/117 SOLVENCY POLB(04)94 ‘

(a) I Peter Corbett reported to the meeting the current’financial
position of the Company. In particular, it was: highlighted that,
unless appropriate new financial support arrangements were
put in place, the Strategic Plan showed ‘the company would.
become insolvent in'2006/07. It'was also reported to the Board
‘that he had attended yesterday with officials. from the
Department of Trade and Industry regarding the Company's
financial position and the:availability of support going forward;

(b) Having’ discussed the position in detail, the: Directors. agreed
that, on the basis of the report:and the discussions held to date
with the Department of Trade and Industry, they believed that
the Company did have a reasonable prospect of avoiding
insolvent liquidation and that, accordingly, the Company could

continue to trade on that basis. It was further agreed that the
solvency of the Company-should-be-carefully monitoredand
teviewed regularly on an ongoing basis and that, in particular,
any material new financial commitments should be considered
very carefully;

(c) Peter Corbett further explained the situation concerning
impairment. The Company had been working on the
assumption that it would no longer have to impair its fixed
assets. However, the financial situation was such that the
Company may néed to continue to impair up to £20m of assets,
although this could be neutralised by utilisation of the proceeds
of asset disposals, critically reviewing all non-essential Capital
Expenditure-and reversing the surplus severance provisions.
Afterdiscussion:the Board agreed that a decision on
impairment should not be taken until nearer the time of the
closure of the‘accounts: The impact of the compensating action
should be avoided if possible as they would be unhelpful for the
Company's progress towards its strategic plan objectives.

(d) The Board was reminded that discussions were taking place: at
Royal Mail Group level with the DT! about re-casting the
Group's balance’sheet, including that of Post Office Ltd. The

Board saw possible advantages in the Post Office Ltd Board
making its concerns known directly to the DTI about the funding
difficulties of the Company, but only to the extent that such an:
approach supported the discussions taking place between
Royal Mail Group and DTI.

(e) The Board agreed that:

Lynn Hobbs (Head of Network Reinvention) and Tony Marsh

the Group Audit Committee;

the Risk and Compliance Committee had found that although
the overall trend of losses due to fraud had fallen from an
annual rate of £29m to.£20m, this area still represented a
significant risk. Brian Goggin informed the Board that as
banking controls had tightened, fraudsters had become more
sophisticated in response. The banking business had found the
risk of fraud perpetrated by employees particularly difficult to =.
manage. A fraud migration risk existed with the advent of chip:
and pin;

controls assurance and self-assessments were taking place
within Post Office Ltd. this month, and an assurance testing plan
would be agreed with the units. 3

The Board agreed that David Smith and David Miller would =:
investigate the possibility of arranging a dummy Bureau

(b)

(c)

The Board noted the report and in particular that:

The new business plan targeted closing the gap left in 2005/06
by the loss of benefits income — profit impact next year £140.
million — to keep next years results on the same level as this.
year — a loss from operations excluding rural funding of
£75million. A further £50 million profit improvement was
projected over the life of the plan through 2009/10. The current
draft excluded a solution to rural funding post 2008;

Period 8 profit from operations was a’ loss of £12.7m, £4.4m
adverse to budget. The variance was due to a £5% million
provision for the irrecoverable VAT issue on banking back office
processing costs. The YTD profit from operations was a loss of
£62.3, £1.3m (2%) adverse to budget. The full year forecast
remained at £3.8m favourable to budget. The operation of Card
Account was effectively providing a £5% million benefit to
Government at Post Office. Ltd’s expense.The Board agreed
that this unreasonable situation should be addressed

ona one-day strike despite the significant risk of
adverse publicity..NFSP had reflected back.the.
