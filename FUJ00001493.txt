Overview

Different levels of access are provided to the Horizon system according to
role.

e Routine access

All users are given a level of access to the system as determined by their
responsibilities in the office. For example, only managers are allowed to
create users. A full list of the applications to which each type of user is
allowed access is given in the Horizon OPS Menu Hierarchy document:
Release 2 [Ref. SD/SPE/016].

« Non-routine access

If a Post Office Counters Ltd Retail Network Manager, Auditor, Investigator or
other support personnel require access to the system then this will be
obtained via the process in Section 05.3.1 Authorised-user passwords.

Many access parameters are centrally configurable in the Horizon system’s

message store, for example session inactivity timeout and password expiry,

and are set to values defined by Post Office Counters Ltd (see Section 0 5.5
Centrally-configurable parameters).

Administrative functions

This section describes procedures for:
« Post Office Logon (POLO)

e System initialisation

e System access

e User administration

e User reports

Post Office Logon

Post Office Logon allows a member of the outlet staff to unlock the file store
of a system when it is first started or is switched back on after being powered
off, and gain access to the Horizon counter system. The procedure involves
the use of a memory card called a PMMC (PostMaster’s Memory Card) and a
PIN (Personal Identity Number). (Note that the PIN is actually a string of
alphanumeric characters.)

Procedures Description ate:

COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE

41.1

4.1.1.1

Initialisation

This procedure generates the key with which the filestore is locked, and
writes it to the PMMC.

To undertake this procedure, the entire Horizon system should be switched
on; for further details refer to Section 0 4.3.1 Daily Horizon system start-up.

The engineer will leave the Horizon system switched on after installation. Two
PMMCs are supplied with the system. One is used in the initialisation
procedure and the other is a spare in case the first is mislaid.

Gateway workstation initialisation

Note: when the term ‘workstation’ is used in this PPD, it refers to the Horizon
system PCs at the outlet. A workstation is sometimes also referred to as a
counter.

The Gateway workstation is the link between the post office and the central
systems. It is the processor of this workstation that must be initialised first to
unlock the file store and gain access to the Horizon system. It will also be this
processor that needs to be used in the event of changing PINs or lost
PINs/PMMCs. The Gateway workstation will be identified as such by the
words ‘GATEWAY WORKSTATION’ displayed on the top left of the screen.

Note: the counter printer must be connected and working when this procedure
is being performed as it has to print a PIN record during the procedure.

Prior to initialisation the screen will display an animated picture of a hand
inserting a card into the smart card reader with the instruction ‘Please insert
your PMWC.....’.

For details regarding the location of the smart card reader, refer to the NR2
Operating Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/0024].

Step 1. Insert the PMMC into the reader, as the diagram on the screen
illustrates.
(The counter printer should print a PIN on the counter printer's tally
roll. This is referred to as the PIN record.)

The following message is displayed: ‘Did the printer print the PIN
completely (15 characters) and legibly?’

SCENARIO A: If the counter printer does not print the PIN:

e Select the No option. The system displays the following message:
‘Your card has not been initialised. Please remove your card and
take remedial action with the printer. The system will now restart.’

e Check the counter printer and take any remedial action as
described in the NR2 Operating Environment PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/0024].

41.2

Regaining access to a switched-off workstation

The procedure to regain access to the Horizon system in the event of the
processor of any workstation (Gateway or non-Gateway) being switched off is
as follows:

Step 1. Switch on the workstation’s processor and the remaining
components of the workstation as outlined in Section 0 4.3.1
Daily Horizon system start-up.

Step 2. Follow the instructions outlined in Section 0 4.1.1.2 Non-
Gateway workstation.

If either the PIN record or the PMMC is unavailable, follow the procedure in
Section 0 4.1.3 Lost PIN/PMMC.

Lost PIN/PMMC

This procedure must be followed in the event that a workstation is switched
off and either the PIN record or the PMMC is unavailable. Without the PIN
and PMMC, the protected filestore cannot be unlocked. The procedure in this
section describes how the Post Master and Helpdesk create a new set of both
PMMC and PIN to unlock the protected filestore. No data is lost on the
counter. If, however, the old set of PMMC and PIN are subsequently found,
they will not work on the counter.

This procedure starts at the Gateway workstation and involves restarting all
the counter workstations.

Notes

¢ Ifthe original workstation switched off was not the Gateway workstation,
then, to avoid disabling the office, this procedure can be left until a more
convenient time. This means that it will not be possible to use the affected
workstation though all others will be available.

e The counter printer must be connected and working when the lost
PIN/PMMC procedure is performed as it has to print a new PIN record
during the procedure.

Step 1. If you have lost your PMMC, check that you have the spare.
EXCEPTION A: If you do not have a spare PMMC:

Step 2. Ensure the Gateway workstation is switched on and displaying
the animated picture and the instruction to ‘Please insert your
PMNC.....’.

(If the Gateway workstation was not the one switched off, any
user at this workstation must log off and the processor must be
switched off and on again to obtain this screen.)

Step 13. Advise the operator that this point has been reached. The
operator may terminate the call.

Step 14. Proceed as from step 5 of Section 0 4.1.1.1 Gateway
workstation.

Changing a PIN

Both the PIN and PMMC are required to authenticate the Post Master to the
counter. The data on the PMMC is encrypted by the PIN. Without both the
PIN and PMMC, the protected filestore cannot be unlocked.

If there is reason to believe that the integrity of the PIN has been
compromised, as this may allow unauthorised access, the PIN must be
changed. This can only be done at the Gateway workstation.

Step 1. Ensure that you have your PMMC and PIN.

Step 2. Log out of the Horizon system (see Section 0 4.3.12 Logout).

Step 3. Turn off the Gateway workstation’s processor, by using the
On/Off Switch.
(Changing the PIN affects the Gateway workstation only. However,
while the Gateway workstation is out of action (Riposte desktop not
running) there is no external communication with the centre. Any non-
Gateway counters will still be available for use.)

Step 4. Turn on the Gateway workstation’s processor, by using the
On/Off Switch.
(The screen displays an animated picture of a hand inserting a card

into the card reader with the instruction ‘Please insert your
PMNC.....’.)

Step 5. Insert the PMMC into the card reader, as the diagram on the
screen illustrates.
(The system displays the PIN Number screen.)

Step 6. The following message is displayed: ‘Please enter your PIN’.
Step 7. Enter the PIN using the keyboard.

EXCEPTION A: If the PIN cannot be entered because the keyboard is
not working:

« Telephone the Horizon System Helpdesk [HSH call POHCO9].
Step 8. Select the Change PIN option.

The following message is displayed: ‘Did the printer print the PIN
completely (15 characters) and legibly?’

SCENARIO A: If the counter printer does not print the PIN:

e Select the No option.
(The system displays a message saying that your PIN has not
been changed.)

Step 7. The system initialises during which there will be a time lapse and
access will be prohibited. (The length of the time lapse cannot
be specified exactly as it will vary depending upon the
circumstances in which the system is being initialised and the
size of the message store on the on counter in question.) When
the Riposte logo appears initialisation is complete.

Step 8. You may now log on to the Horizon system (see Section 0 4.3.2
Logon).
Replacement non-Gateway workstation

If an engineer replaces a non-Gateway workstation of the Horizon system,
follow the procedure in Section 0 4.1.1.2Non-Gateway workstation.

System initialisation

After the Horizon system has been installed, the manager MUST perform the
system initialisation procedure. This allows the manager to set up a user
identity for themselves with manager access, after which they can create
identities for other users.

Business rules:

« Allusers must have been through the Horizon Service Training Event and
passed the competency test.

The set up procedure is as follows:

Step 1. Log on to the system with the user name ZSET01 and the
password FIRST1 (see Section 0 4.3.2 Logon).

Step 2. Create a user identity for yourself with manager access (see
Section 0 4.4.1 Add user).

Step 3. Log out (see Section 0 4.3.12 Logout).
Step 4. Log on as the new manager user.
Step 5. Delete the ZSET01 user (see Section 0 4.4.3 Delete user).

EXCEPTION A: If you are not able to delete the ZSETO1 user (that is,
you do not have manager access):

e Log out.

e Repeat steps 1 to 5, but in step 2 modify your existing user
identity to give yourself manager access (see Section 0 4.4.2.1
Modify user procedure).

Step 6. Create all additional users if required (see Section 0 4.4.1
Add user).

Daily Horizon system start-up

The start-up procedure for the counter system is as follows:

Step 1. Ensure the office equipment is connected to the power supply.
Step 2. Press the switch on the monitor to the ‘I’ or ‘on’ position.

Step 3. Press the switch on the counter printer to the ‘I’ or ‘on’ position.

(The reports printer need only be switched on when required.)

Note: The processor will only require switching on at the first time of
operation and if there has been reason for it to be switched off,
for example, if instructed by the Horizon System Helpdesk. In
normal circumstances, the processor will be left switched on at
all times to enable the transfer of data. No re-connection of any
cables to the system should be done by the user - excepting
ensuring that the power cable is plugged into the mains socket
and turned on. Any other reconnection of cables requires a call
to the Horizon System Helpdesk [HSH call POHC12].

If the processor is switched off by accident, the procedure
described in Section 0 4.1.2 Regaining access to a switched-
off workstation must be followed.

Note: refer to the NR2 Operating Environment PPD [Ref.CS/PRO/0024] for

hardware checks that should be performed if any of the equipment is not

functioning correctly.

4.3.2 Logon

This function is used to enable a user to enter their user name and password
in order to access the system.

Note: during logon at a multi-counter office, if the user presses the F1 key
followed by any other function key before the system has fully displayed the
initial screen, the counter will ‘freeze’. If this happens, the user should either
re-boot the affected counter or log in elsewhere to unfreeze the counter.

System rules:

« The user is allowed a number of logon attempts before they are locked out
of the system. The maximum number of logon attempts, the period during
which the attempts are measured, and the period that the account remains
locked if the number of attempts is exceeded, are configurable parameters
(see Section 0 5.5 Centrally-configurable parameters).

The procedure to log on is as follows:

Step 1. Ensure that the system is displaying the initial screen with the
Riposte logo in the centre of the screen.

Step 2. Touch the screen or press any key.
(The system displays the agreement screen.)

Step 3. If you agree, select the Tick option.
(The system displays the Logon screen.)

Step 4. Enter your user name and select the Tick option.
Step 5. Enter your user password and select the Tick option.

Step 6. The system undertakes initialisation checks, and displays the
date and time of the user’s last successful logon and the number
of failed attempts.

EXCEPTION A: If the logon attempt fails (that is, if the wrong user
name or password has been entered):

e An error message is displayed and the system prompts for re-
entry.

e Proceed to step 4 or 5 as appropriate.

EXCEPTION B: If the maximum number of failed logon attempts has
been reached:

e The user account is locked and the system returns to the initial
screen with the Riposte logo in the centre of the screen. The
lockout lasts until the preset period has expired (see Section 0
5.5 Centrally-configurable parameters) or the account is
unlocked by the manager (see Section 0 4.4.2.1.2 Modify a
user’s options).

e This ends the procedure.

Session inactivity time-out (system invoked)

A session is timed-out after a period of inactivity (that is, whereby there has
been no input from any of the peripherals) of a pre-configured time (see
Section 0 5.5 Centrally-configurable parameters). After this time, a user logon
screen is displayed saying that the session is currently locked by that user
and that the user’s password needs to be entered to unlock the screen.

The user can re-activate the terminal in the same way as described in Section
04.3.7 Temporary lock (user-invoked). If another user wishes to
override the current user, they can do so in the way described in Section 0
4.3.9 Over-riding the current user.

If the user that is logged on is one who is operating via an authorised-user
password (see Section 05.3.1. Authorised-user passwords) then when the
user logon screen appears after a period of inactivity and they have accepted
the user name, they will be prompted to obtain another authorised-user
password, via the process in Section 0 5.3.1 Authorised-user passwords, in

displayed and enter their own user name and password.

The system displays the Logout User screen and a message asking the new
user whether they are sure that they wish to log the current user out, and
telling them that any outstanding transactions will be committed using cash as
the method of payment. If the user selects the Tick option, the system logs
the current user out and re-displays the initial screen with the Riposte logo in
the centre of the screen. The new user must log in again as described in
Section 0 4.3.2 Logon. If the user selects the Cross option, the system re-
displays the Username screen with the current user’s username displayed in
the username field.

If the current user is logged out, the system does not produce a receipt.
When a new user logs on again after over-riding the current user, the Reprint
Receipt function can be used to produce a session receipt showing the
transactions committed.

4.3.10 User logged on at a crashed counter

If a counter crashes, the user attached to the counter cannot be attached to
new stock unit as the system believes that the user is still logged on at the
crashed counter. If this happens, the user should log on and off at another
counter.

If the user in question has left the office, their stock unit remains active as
they have not logged off. This will inhibit the office balance and can cause
other problems. In this case, the manager should change the user’s password
and then log on and off as that user.

4.3.11 Forced logout

If there is a further period of inactivity of a pre-configured time (see Section 0
5.5 Centrally-configurable parameters) after a session has timed-out and
the user logon screen has appeared, the system forces a permanent logout.
This results in the user being logged out, and the Riposte logo appearing in
the centre of the screen.

After a forced logout, any customer session currently in progress, including a
suspended session, is committed against cash. The system does not produce
a receipt. When a user logs on again after a forced logout, the Reprint
Receipt function can be used to produce a session receipt showing the
transactions committed.

If the session is not a customer session, settlement is against the appropriate
settlement product. The system produces a receipt if the session is of the
type where an automatic receipt is printed (for example, remittances or
transfers).

If the user leaves the Horizon system without completing a transaction, the
system will progress through the following sequence of events leading to a
forced logout after 74 minutes:

e Between 0 and 14 minutes and 59 seconds, the screen and system
remain active allowing the user to return and progress the transaction in
the normal manner.

e Between 15 and 73 minutes and 59 seconds, the user will be locked out of
the system under the ‘Temporary Lock’ condition. The user should enter
his/her password to return to the position at which the lock-out occurred
and the transaction can be progressed in the normal manner. If the user is
subject to a forced password change during this process, the standard
procedure should be followed (see Section 0 4.3.4 Enforced change of
password facility) and the new password will then allow access to the
transaction.

e Auser with a Manager’s authority can log the original user out of the
Temporary Lock at any time and the transaction will be completed as
‘PAID’ that is:

An OBCS book receipt, book issue or redirection transaction is
completed; and all records for an OBCS encashment for which the
value had been entered will show that the customer has received
the value of one or more foils.

APS and EPOSS transactions will be committed.

e After 74 minutes, the user will be forcibly logged out of the system and the
transaction will be completed as ‘PAID’ automatically by the system, that
is:

An OBCS book receipt, book issue or redirection transaction is
completed; and all records for an OBCS encashment for which the
value had been entered will show that the customer has received
the value of one or more foils.

APS and EPOSS transactions will be committed. The user cannot
reverse the committal of the transactions. However, the transactions
themselves may be reversed (providing they are defined in
reference data as being reversible). See the NR2 APS PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/0045] and the NR2 EPOSS PPD [Ref.CS/PRO/0021] for

User administration

User administration consists of maintaining the identities of users on the
system. A user identity consists of a user name, full name, password and
group as follows:

. User name: This consists of six specific characters as defined in
Section 0 5.1 Usernames.

e Full name: This consists of two fields, the user’s first and last name.
Standards for full names are described in Section 0 5.2 Full names.

. Password: This is specific to the user and prevents unauthorised
access. Standards for passwords are described in Section 0 5.3
Passwords.

. Group: This determines the functions available to the user according to
their role. Further information on groups is given in Section 0 5.4
Groups.

Note: an additional component of a user identity, called a Teller Id, is not
used.

System rule:

« Only users with manager access rights are allowed to add, modify and

5.2

« Business rules:

A user's user name consists of six characters in the following format:
first initial, first two letters of the user’s surname, three numeric
characters (always 001 unless there is more then one occurrence of
the user name). For example, the first Elvis Presley to be described
to the system within a post office would have the user name
EPROO01. Ella Presley, or a second Elvis Presley, would appear as
EPROO2.

If using the user’s first initial and the first two letters of the user’s
surname gives more than two successive duplicate characters, the
third duplicate character (second from the surname) should be
omitted and the third character from the surname should be used
instead. For example, Linda Llewellyn would appear as LLEO01.

If the next numeric character in the current sequence leads to three
repeated characters, the third duplicate character should be omitted
and the next number in the sequence used instead. For example,
the number 111 would be omitted and the number 112 used instead.

Notes:

e The user name uniquely identifies the user to the system, and must be
used every time the user logs on.

 Itis solely for the designated person’s use; users must NOT allow others to
use it.

e Users must not use, or attempt to use any user name that has not been
explicitly issued to themselves.

Full names

Full names must conform to the following standards:

e System rules:
e Atleast one character must be entered in each of the fields.
e The system does not allow the entry of more than one first name.
e No spaces can be committed to the first name field.

¢ The maximum number of characters that can be entered is 16. This
is character dependent - wider characters (W for example) will take
up more space, narrower characters (I for example) will take up less
space.

e Business rules:

e Ifaname is too long to fit in the displayed box, it should be
truncated when it reaches the end point.

e A password cannot be the same as the user name.

« Passwords must not use the words detailed in a list of excluded
words defined by POCL Product Management. This list contains
obvious words such as PASSWORD and SECRET, and names.

e A password cannot contain spaces or more than two successive

e A password must be at least 6 characters and no more than 14
characters.

e A password must be changed immediately if it has been allocated
by someone else, i.e. when the user is first introduced to the
system, the password is modified or when ‘Must Change Password’
is set on.

e A.user cannot change their password more than once within 24
hours.

e Passwords will expire according to a pre-configured duration (see
Section 05.5 Centrally-configurable parameters).

e Passwords can only be reused after a pre-configured number of
password changes have elapsed (see Section 0 5.5 Centrally-
configurable parameters).

e Business rules:

e A password must contain letters and numbers, at least one of each.

e A.user’s initial password is to be known only by the person creating
the user and the new user. Subsequent passwords must be known
only the user and must not be revealed to anybody else.

Generally users must:

Ensure their password is private, user selected, and not revealed to
anyone.

Not write down their password.

Change their password immediately if they believe it may be known to
someone else.

Ensure they are not observed when entering or changing their password.

Authorised-user passwords

An authorised-user password is granted to verified users and allows access
to the system for one session only.

The procedure to obtain an authorised-user password is detailed in the POCL
‘Authorised-user Password Procedure’ which describes how the user obtains
authorisation from the Network Business Support Centre and how the Horizon
System Helpdesk and the user interact [HSH call SEC003].
