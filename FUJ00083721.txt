Gareth,

KEL CObeng2025L (amongst others) - can you see KELs?

I'd forgotten - this did give a discrepancy, but also a receipts and payments mismatch, if they persisted and rolled over (though it was
usually obvious that something was wrong).

And a flood of NT events (not 'riposte events'!) which SMC should have noticed at the time.

Since we are now checking for these particular events, and did a catch up for old retrievals, can you say that the current branch did not
have this problem??

Anyway it stopped happening once S90 was installed (around 4th March 2006, according to info below)

This particular problem would only affect branches with more than one stock unit. It happened several times at Callander Square,
though we never found why they were so badly affected.

Is this sufficient?

Anne

Mike,
I believe John has already responded to this, so don't know if you need any more from me...

Haven't looked at the recent evidence, but I know in the past this site had hit this Riposte lock problem 2 or 3 times within a few weeks.
This problem has been around for years and affects a number of sites most weeks, and finally Escher say they have done something
about it. I am interested in whether they really have fixed it which it why I left the call open - to remind me to check over the whole
estate once $90 is live - call me cynical but I do not just accept a 3rd party's word that they have fixed something!

What I never got to the bottom of, having usually had more pressing things to do, was why this outlet was particularly prone to the
problem. Possibly because they follow some particular procedure/sequence which makes it more likely to happen? This could still be
worth investigating, especially if they have continuing problems, but I don't think it is worthwhile until we know the S90 position.

Please note that KELs tell SMC that they must contact sites and warn them of balancing problems if they notice the event storms
caused by the held lock, and advise them to reboot the affected counter before continuing with the balance. Unfortunately in practice it
seems to take SMC several hours to notice these storms by which time the damage may have been done.

John, Did you get time to look at this ? do we think all will be well after S90 counter rollout ?.

Anne, You are always a good place to start, having read the call I see you have left the following note:Call E-0510120769

Wed 01 February 2006 15:55 by PINICL / Saved: Wed 01 February 2006 15:55 Update by Anne Chambers:Category 40 -- Pending --
Incident Under Investigation: The timeout events are apparently fixed in a new Riposte version released at S90 - see PC0126376. I've
looked at problems reported on 31st Jan - can't see why the system reported disconnected nodes, nor why the same user could log on
twice (except that this followed a session transfer which silently failed, for no obvious reason). I don't think there were any ill-effects. I
think the best thing now is to see what happens after S90. I'll continue to keep this call open to remind me that this site should be
checked then.

I notice that in the early guise of this problem in the call it states the PM as Female:

Wed 12 October 2005 17:39 by UK956078 / HSH1 Saved: Wed 12 October 2005 17:39 Pm was trying to transfer £2490 from node 7
onto node 2. She states that she has accepted the transfer on node 2 but the system is not showing this. On node 7 it is showing
pending transfer but it is not showing on node 2. It appears on her transfer sheet as cmpleated.

At the bottom of this email re a magical £43k appearing and disapearing the PM is Male He reports:

You may recall that in September the above office had major problems with their Horizon system relating to transfers between stock
units.

The Spmr has reported that he is again experiencing problems with transfers, (05.01.06) which resulted in a loss of around £43k which
has subsequently rectified itself. I know that the Spmr has reported this to Horizon Support , who have come back to him stating that
they cannot find any problem.

Clearly the Spmr is concerned as we have just spent a number of months trying to sort out the first instance and he doesn't want a
repeat performance. He is convinced that there is something wrong with his Horizon kit. I would be grateful if you could investigate
this and give him any support that you can. I'm due to visit the office tomorrow to have a look at his paperwork and discuss the
situation with him.

So apologies for the long windedness but I have been given this by Liz as a problem so:

1. Is there a problem at this branch ? is it Horizon kit or is there an issue with staff there ?

2. If there is an issue is this S90 release the cure ? how confident are you/we it will fix the problem ?

3. S90 counter release due week 4th March. Getting Sarah to check if this site is in the pilot 24th or just part of the general release 4th
March.

Appreciate your comments please

Regards Mike

Please see Shaun's questions below. I'm not aware of other branches having this problem?

If this is an isolated incident how confident are we that the fix will work and can they be moved up the pecking order for release?

Gary,
Thanks for looking into this for us. Couple of questions occur: -

Do we understand why this particular branch has been having problems? Or
are there other branches in the network that have been having this
problem?

Can this branch be front ended on the counter release of S90 such that

it gets the fix as soon as possible?

The e-mail from Liz suggests that there may be a reoccurence following
$90. What degree of certainty do we have that it will definitely be

fixed?

Sandra/Brian - Appreciate this is frustrating for the branch but from the e-mail below you can see that the branches issue should be
fixed with the release of the S90 software. I have asked Gary above to see if we can put this branch to the front of the queue for the
$90 release. In the meantime it is important that the branch continues to report any issues into HSD.

I have checked the call and this issue is scheduled to be resolved in S90.

$90 has already been deployed to the Datacentre and counter release is scheduled to start 04/03/06, due for completion 14/04/06.

3rd line support has been discussing with the PM, and the last contact with the branch (according to Powerhelp) was on 1st Feb. The
call has been left open for 3rd line to check to see if the issue reoccurs following s90.

Please let me know if I can provide any other assistance with this matter.

Thanks

Gary,

Need your advise on this branch. There appears to be an ongoing problem at this branch with transfers between SU's causing a
receipts and payments mismatch. This first came to my attention some 3 or 4 months ago, when the branch was chasing up an error
notice to account for a loss that they had that was related to the R & P mismatch. I believe in that case that FS had taken it on board
and were investigating it as a problem (I seem to recall it had a PinICL number). I had to do some chasing around with P & BA to
ensure that the error notice got issued, as there was a breakdown in processes between them and FS relating to the BIM report.

Since then it appears to have happened again, although Fujitsu are saying no issue could be detected. I am concerned that there is a

fundamental flaw with the branches configuration, and would be interested to know how FS put the first issue to bed.

Let me know your thoughts.

Further to Sandra's email, I visited the branch with Sandra last week and the Spmr provided clear documented evidence that
something very wrong is occurring with some of the processors when carrying out transfers between stock units. To be absolutely sure

from our side can we either carry out a thorough check of the alleged faulty processors or swap them out.

Thanks
