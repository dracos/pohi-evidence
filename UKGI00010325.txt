heov Oliver,

Thank you for your letter of 13 November regarding the Post Office Horizon IT system.

I met with Ron Warmington and lan Henderson from Second Sight on 19 October. It was a
helpful meeting and they raised a number of important points. I suggested that they contact Tim
Parker, the new Chair of Post Office Limited, to follow these points up.

Tim is currently conducting a review into this issue and has appointed a QC to advise him. I
understand he is currently setting up meetings with the key parties and I am expecting him to
update me on his findings in the New Year.

GRO.

BARONESS NEVILLE-ROLFE DBE CMG
