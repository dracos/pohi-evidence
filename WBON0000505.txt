Thanks for sending the 13 October 2016 letter, Amy.

I’m a little concerned that we may be playing into their hands by provoking a CPR 31.14 application for inspection of
the KEL. Unless we play our cards right, this could give them the chance to portray us as unnecessarily (and therefore
suspiciously) defensive, obstructive and possibly even evasive about the KEL.

Could you also send over our letter dated 1 September 2017 — if their summary of it is fair (which I doubt) I would like
to understand why we seem to have claimed that the KEL is not a document, when it plainly is, and why we don't seem
to have mentioned that it is not in our control, which seems to me to be a critical point.

On the question of control, we need to be absolutely clear that we have no right to inspect or take copies of the KEL,
either under the Fujitsu contract or under the law of agency (is Fujitsu holding it as our agent?), and that there is no
practice under which we are habitually or usually allowed to inspect documents of this sort if we want to see them.

Best wishes,

Tony
