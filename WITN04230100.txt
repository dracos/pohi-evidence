                    POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY



           FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JOHN H BENNETT




1.     I have spent my full professional career in the IT Industry . I started as

a programmer in 1966 with English Electric Computers and soon moved into

sales and then sales management with ICL Following time as a Regional

Customer Services Manager I became Director of an ICL Business Division

before becoming Sales and Marketing Director for ICL (UK) . I became ICL

Director for the Benefits Agency/Post Office Counters business from 1994 to

the beginning of 2000.. After two years as Group Executive Director for

Fujitsu Services I left the company in 2002.



2.    1 was appointed to lead the sales team bidding for the BA/POCL PFI

contract in 1994. Some two years later the contract was awarded to ICL. ICL

Pathway was established and I was asked to continue on the project as

Managing Director. The PH contract was substantially modified after three

years and a new service based contract was agreed with the Post Office .

                                                                                   WITNO4230100
                                                                                  WITN04230100




The Benefits Agency ceased to be involved from that time. I continued with

 ICL Pathway until the beginning of 2000 at which time the service contract

had achieved Acceptance by the Post Office and the national roll out of

computer systems to the Post Office network was underway.



3.      1 was the ICL sales manager in charge of the team submitting the ICL

bid for the BA/POCL contract. When this original contract was changed a

small team from ICL negotiated the new service contract with the Post Office .

I was not a member of this team.



4.      The main aim of the Horizon Project was to bring computerisation to all

the Post Offices in the UK to replace the paper driven systems . All

transactions would be processed through the new system giving both a more

accurate and better service and providing a platform to win new business for

the Post Office Network . For the Benefit Agency there was a need to move to

a more secure, cost effective system with lower levels of fraud.




the satisfaction of all parties.



6.     The procurement started in 1994 and led to a contract with ICL in

7.     There was a major challenge in getting full clarity of the specification of

requirements. Due to time pressure within HMG the original PFI contract was

signed by all parties with many items still to be agreed at a future date.

Another key challenge for ICL Pathway was the management of multiple sub

contractors. This included a number of small companies with innovative

products which were critical to the ICL Pathway solution. These companies

required careful management by senior managers in ICL Pathway.

10.    The main purpose of the Initial Go Live (IGL) was to pilot the new

systems in a selected number of Post Offices to ensure that all aspects of

implementation were satisfactory. This was the first opportunity to use the

new system in a real environment. Prior to IGL all testing was conducted in -

house in a purpose built test centre.

15.       A major challenge in the preparation for the national roll-out was

dealing with the large scale of the operation. There were 1000's of staff to

train most of whom were not Post Office employees . There were in excess of

17,000 Post Offices most of which were in premises not owned by the Post

Office. The physical condition of these was very variable with very limited

information available . Each office had to be surveyed to determine what

                                                                                   WITN04230100




works were needed prior to roil-out. This would lead to physical, electrical and

network programmes of work. All of this had to be carried out with the support

of the Post Office in such a way to minimise the disruption to the ongoing

business.



16.    All known errors in the system (hardware, software, documentation,

process, procedures, training, etc) were logged, monitored and corrective

actions agreed. Each subsequent release would implement fixes as agreed

with the Post Office.



17.    Some of the delays to the Horizon Project were caused by the

incomplete or missing specifications in the original PFI contract. There was a

substantial delay in HMG awarding the contract due to its scope and

complexity. HMG was under pressure to stop further procurement delays and

this led to the contract being placed with numerous areas left for future

agreement . Many of these were of course difficult to resolve and required

considerable effort and time to address by all parties.




within ICL Pathway to bring these delays under control.



19.   Some of the delays to the Horizon Project were due to the difficulties

the Horizon Project.



20      All these delays were of serious concern to everyone, and confidence

in the timely delivery of the Horizon Project was badly effected.



21      These delays impacted the business case of all parties. For ICL

Pathway there was a substantial cost base with large numbers of staff,

extensive accommodation and equipment investments. The structure of the

original contract allowed for no revenue returns until the system was fully

accepted, installed and delivering a flow of transactions through the Post

Office network.



22..    ICL continued to provide all the funds and resources to ICL Pathway to

allow it to fulfil its contracted obligations and to make a success of the




23.     ICL Pathway was not involved in the decision making process which

led to DSS withdrawing from the project. DSS staff had made it clear for

quite some time that they viewed the payment of benefits directly to claimants

through the UK banking system to be a viable and cost effective alternative to

the contracted arrangements with the Post Office.

27.     The roll-out of Horizon was a huge undertaking. This required

extensive and thorough planning and a large number of resources from both

ICL Pathway and the Post Office. Each of the 17,000 Post Offices had its own

plan covering site preparation, training, equipment and network deliveries, go-

live support teams, post installation support and helpdesks dealing with

equipment, software, applications, documentation and procedures.

31.    Installing new computer system in over 17,000 Post Offices was a

highly complex and resource demanding operation for both ICL Pathway and

the Post Office. Both parties worked closely together to achieve this and there

was a collective view that the key objectives were being achieved. As in the

early days of any major IT project there were a range of incidents and

problems requiring constant and professional attention by all parties.

not up to the challenges faced.

35.    The Post Office were determined to succeed with the Horizon Project

since it was not practical to continue to run such a wide and diverse estate of

Post Offices on what was basically a paper driven system. There had been

earlier attempts at delivering IT solutions but none of these had progressed

beyond limited pilots.



36.    Throughout the period from procurement to roll-out ICL Pathway had

operated on an open and transparent management approach. All project

processes and outcomes were rigorously recorded and shared as appropriate

with all levels of management both within ICL Pathway itself and more widely

in ICL, Fujitsu and the Post Office.



37.   The Post Office Horizon Project was a challenging and exciting

business venture for ICL. It was an opportunity to exploit and develop its skill

base and to grow its reputation in the field of large and demanding IT

services.
