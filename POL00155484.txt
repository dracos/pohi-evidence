Al,

Tactical GE meetings

I pasted below the sessions requested currently for the tactical GE meetings (highlighted in yellow where timings not
firmed up). I’m copying Dan as I understand you want to crack on with project owners doing their ten minutes slots

and Dan is teeing up the presenters. Do you want the Data Platform item moved to 26" Feb to give more time for
project presentations on 12" Feb?

Monthly GE February, additional Board 10" March, Board 24" March. GE meeting table 2020.

Please find the draft agendas attached. My main uncertainty is what is going to be ready to go when:

1. Do you want long slots for 2020/21 Budget and Draft 5 Year Plan at GE on 19" February and will you need
further GE discussions before the papers go to the 10" March Board?

2. Is an hour sufficient for all the finance items to 24" March Board (should be rubber stamping at this point
for 2020/21 budget and 5 year plan?)?

3. Do we need anything on Insurance for the March Board? It was on your March Board items (what
decisions are we making about which markets we are in etc)

Notes:

I haven't included PSG, Telecoms or Royal Mail Negotiations on the agendas. I’m not clear at the moment what is
going to be needed when.

10 March 2020 — photographs of Board and GE are going to be taken to get a consistent style for the corporate
website

24 March 2020 — the annual NED discussion on the Chairman’s performance will take place after the Board meeting.

Best wishes
