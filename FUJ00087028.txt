From the discussion yesterday there are 2 things that come to mind:

e This may have been in the test system only as it was in the basement — Can we show there was no access to a live system
[GU] The test system and live system should be physically separated. I expect that Bill can provide proof of this via the various
audits and PEN tests. In particular I wouldn’t expect any Testers to have access to Live. The allegations relate to 2008. From
memory, at that time we had some Horizon test systems in the basement and also access to the new HNG-X test systems in
Belfast which were being built. There wouldn’t have been any access to the Live system at Wigan Bootle other than from SSC on
6" Floor, the Security team and possibly the Ref data team — none of whom were in the basement.

e — Is the premise in the ops manual correct
[G1] Sorry not sure what this is — unless it is expanded on later in the email chain

and could the person in the basement be able to make the change
[GJ] I don’t see how anybody in the basement in BRAO1 could access Live.

e Would this person be PO or Fujitsu?

[GU] At the time we had a joint test team so the testers could be POL, Fujitsu (or a POL contractor or a Fujitsu contractor — both
companies hired many contractors at that time!)
Any other questions we need to answer.

Pete/Gareth

I have now received a response from lan Henderson (Second Sight) clarifying the specific line of enquiry in their current

investigations into the POL Bracknell site.

lan’s specific questions are listed in his email below. They primarily concentrate on Horizon system data access capabilities and
controls rather than procedures. To provide greater context, also attached is the spot review that outlines the specific allegation.

As a matter of urgency, could you provide a response to each of lan’s points and feed these back to me asap. I suggest your

responses are clear paragraphed statements rather than a provision of further information via attachments etc.

I will then collate and formally feedback to lan.

Please also note the potential that a further line of questions may be created from Second Sight’s ongoing review of the

information they have recently received.

Thanks as always for your co-operation.

Steve
I’m sorry for the delay in replying. There’s a lot going on at the moment...
I attach a copy of Spot Review 5 which describes the allegations that have been made.

The emails that have been forwarded to you appear to describe matters that may be relevant to the allegation. Please note that we
are primarily interested in finding out the following:

1. What capabilities did the POL Bracknell team have? (As far as TC or Rem Out type transactions or Journal adjustments are
concerned)
[GIJ] Testers wouldn’t have any access to do this on Live. However testers would have the capability of injecting TCs into the Test
systems so as to be able to test their affect on a a test counter.
On Live, we should have had an audit of any TCs sent by POL. Any TCs sent to a Branch would be visible in the Branch’s audit. If
there is a specific allegation for a Branch we could probably look for unusual times for TC delivery and even check against the TC
audit. In theory SSC could inject a TC into the Horizon Data Centre (but we then rely on vetting etc).
2. What were the PHYSICAL or LOGICAL controls over their use of the systems available to them?
[G1] Probably one for Bill. But in summary testers couldn’t access Live.
3. What audit trail is available to show the extent that they posted TC or Rem Out type transactions, or Journal adjustments?
[GU] There would be an audit trail for Live, but not for test systems, so we’re into proving a negative again.
4. Can we reply of the COMPLETENESS of the audit trail? i.e. does it record all transactions or just transactions meeting
certain criteria? Is it protected from user manipulation?
[GI] The Branch Audit trail would record any spurious transactions that Support or Ops staff may have generated. So if there is
an allegation of such transactions being generated we could check against the TCs sent by POL. This is practical for a single
Branch of a set period of time, but not more generally.
5. What USER ID was used if TC type transactions or journal adjustments were posted?
[GI] TCs injected in the Data Centre (either genuinely or spuriously) would not have an associated user ID.
6. Could the POL Bracknell team log on with either super user or SMPR credentials?
[Gl] I don’t believe anybody on POL could access any of the Live system other than by nlogging on in a Branch.
7. How would TC, Rem Out or Journal Adjustment type transactions executed by the POL Bracknell team be seen by SPMR of
Branches affected by those actions?
[GU] As above, I don’t think POL had such access. It would only be possible for Fujitsu Support and Ops staff.

There are probably other questions / issues that will arise after you have had a preliminary look at this.

FUJ00087028

Please note that we’re not really interested in what the procedures manual says about any of this. We need to look at whether it
would be possible for a rogue employee to do what is alleged and what log files would be generated to record that activity. Please
note that I have now been provided with a second batch of employee email and I may find other emails that are potentially
relevant to this matter.

Thank you for your help with this

Hi lan
l’ve been forwarded the email stream below however having not been party to prior conversations or spoken to Susan as she is
formally off-work I just need to understand the context of the enquiry as the email pdf’s attached are a collection of individual
instances rather than a clear line.
My perception of what I think you need is;
1) Aclear documentation/articulation of the end-to-end Transaction Corrections process, how it is applied and the sign-off
authorities that are in place (e.g. subpostmaster acceptance etc.).

2) An understanding of how the attached email instances relate to that process and authorities.

Let me know if I’m on the right lines or not.

Thanks
