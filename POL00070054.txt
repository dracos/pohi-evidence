Start time: Units:

I had a telephone conversation with Ruth Simpson. Explaining to her what had happened re:
the evidence of the last witness of the Post Office - Ann Chambers of Fujitsu and the
document we had now disclosed and that as a consequence Mr Castleton wanted to re-
examine her. Explaining that on the one hand, I was conscious this was going to incur
further inconvenience, time and cost to both the Post Office and the witnesses. On the other
hand I wanted to make sure Mr Castleton had an absolutely fair crack of the whip. Asking
her whether she would be available for next Thursday. She is. 1 agreed to ring her on
Monday and let her know what is happening.

Time Engaged: 6 Minutes
