Horizon Training : Competency and Conformance

Many thanks for all the input at our recent meeting - we actually made quite a
lot of progress! As promised, I attach the following: -

* asummary of the action points (Annex A)

alist (kindly compiled by Clare) of the various pieces of work that we
know have been completed and how we think they can help (Annex B)

¢ atyped up copy of the first draft of the competency definition (Annex C)

¢ acopy of our ‘gap’/’vent your frustration’ list (Annex D) :

I'd be grateful if you could look through each attachment and let me have any
comments back asap.

We agreed that we needed to get together again around the middle of March
(I'll get Anna to sort out a date with you all) to do the following:

¢ understand the key findings of:
1, the various reports that have'already been produced (as listed in
Annex B - do shout if any more occur to you)
2, the research services work into the demographic and other

indicators of pre-entry level competence

identify priorities (we'll need to agree how we're going to identify them
first) —

scope out the ‘gap filling’ activities that could be appropriate (which would
need to be worked up outside of the meeting) and implications for POCL.
