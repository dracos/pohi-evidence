                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY


        FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF STEPHEN ROBERT GRAYSTON



I, Stephen Robert Grayston, in response to the Rule 9 request from the Post Office

Horizon IT Inquiry, dated 05 August 2022, will say as follows:

   1. I was employed by Royal Mail Group (RMG), Post Office Counters Limited

      (POCL), from January 1986 until the formal separation of Post Office Ltd from

      Royal Mail Group in April 2012 whereupon I moved to the Royal Mail Group IT

      function, In 2018 I left Royal Mail Group. Since leaving Royal Mail Group, I have

      worked as IT Director and Chief Information Officer for a non-UK postal services

      provider and I am currently an IT Advisor working outside of the UK.

   2. During my career with RMG I undertook various roles. From 1989 to 1995, I was

       an Investigation Office with RMG, which involved investigating irregularities

      deemed significant in operations within the RMG companies. In 1995, I was

      appointed as a manager in the BAIPOCL Programme that was in the process of

      being established in Terminal House, Grosvenor Gardens, London.

                                                                                    WI TN03920100




3. My initial work on the BA/POCL Programme was as part of the evaluation team

   reviewing supplier proposals for the provision of an integrated point of sale postal

   retail system and also (originally) scoped to replace the legacy paper token

   based payment of benefits with a Smart Card based encashment system, My

   initial area of work was to assess the supplier capability for the provision of end

   user help desk and support services. The result of the sourcing process identified

   ICL Pathway as the contracted partner for the delivery of the Programme and

   subsequent maintenance in steady state operations.

4. As the Inquiry will already know the scope of the contract for services with ICL

   Pathway changed and the Programme was restructured when the Benefits

   Agency withdrew. It was during this period that the Programme was renamed

   from BA / POCL to Horizon.

5. As the Programme moved forwards the nature of my role changed. I undertook

   the role of in-office migration manager, which required the assurance of the

   supplier solutions to migrate stock and accounting data to the new Horizon

   system in each Post Office. I was then part of the central team that managed the

   Horizon implementation plan working with ICL Pathway and the 4 POCL Horizon

   implementation teams. Following rollout of Horizon, I was appointed to work as a

   Change Manager for the upgrade Programme that I believe was called IMPACT.

6. Within the IMPACT Programme, as Change Manager, my role was to understand

   the nature of the changes to front and back office processes, the nature of the

   cutover to the upgraded services, and developing people engagement,

   communications and training with support from POCL functional representatives.

                                                                                        W ITN03920100




   As part of the team effort, the role also required support in the provision of end

   users in User Acceptance Testing.

7. The early stages of the BA/POCL Programme had many challenges such as the

   supplier ramping up with sufficient capable resources and the various

   programme teams becoming established, Work was conducted in ICL Pathway's

   Feltham facility and Terminal House and meetings were undertaken with POCL

   and Benefits Agency business function representatives. Change management

   was established and engagement with staff and various representative bodies

   was developed. The scope and scale of the Programme was significant, I believe

   that it was sometimes referred to as the largest infrastructure Programme in

   Europe, outside of military contracts.

8. Software Releases and the effects of such releases

   (Referring to FUJ00058348, FUJ00058333, FUJ00058331, FUJO0078114.)

   The first Release of the BA/POCL Programme was, in my view, part of the

   confidence building exercise for stakeholders. The Initial Go-Live (IGL) Release

   was to 10 offices located in the South Wales / South West of England and

   provided a standalone Benefits Encashment Service (BES). From memory the

   BES was based on a small number of volunteer Child Benefit recipients agreeing

   to use a Smart Card to enable them to access their benefits in 10 selected post

   offices. The BES ran alongside legacy services with an appropriate adjustment to

   the end of week accounting process to reflect both BES transactions and legacy

   paper token benefits transactions. This Release was known as Initial Go-Live

   (IGL) and as Release 1a.

                                                                                     W I TN 03920100




9. The Programme developed a solution for the validation of paper-based tokens;

   this was known as the Order Book Control Service (OBCS). Whilst IGL continued

   in live operation a group of offices was identified, approximately 200 in total, to

   undertake the OBCS as part of a Release lb. From memory, the OBCS also ran

   in parallel to legacy services and so there was no in-office migration or

   decommissioning of other systems.

10. I cannot recall the background details however, a decision was made to bring all

   IGL and Release 1b offices on to the same operating baseline and this was the

   scope of Release 1 c. This impacted approximately 210 offices only. The

   migration to Release 1 c (as with all Releases) required a careful co-ordination of

   activities that involved multiple partners both internal to POCL and external with

   supplier teams.

11. The experiences of the IGL, Release 1 b and Release 1 c provided input to the

   design of the implementation plan. One of the critical areas within the plan was

   how to optimise support to branch managers and staff at the point of Horizon

   implementation and go-live. Under the contract with ICL Pathway, the obligation

   for support of offices through transition and into Live lay with ICL Pathway. Due

   to the extensive knowledge of regional operational staff in respect of POCL

   culture, processes and general operations a contract change was agreed with

   !CL Pathway whereby POCL would provide Horizon Field Support Officers

   (HFSO's), managed through each of the 4 national implementation teams (IPI to

   IP4), to support the agreed Horizon rollout plan. Effectively POCL were sub

   contracted to provide support to the rollout of Horizon to meet ICL Pathway

                                                                                      WI TN03920100




   contractual obligations to POCL. The result of the change was that a stream of

   work was developed to define the role of the HFSO, define relevant service

   metrics and management information I reporting, to recruit and train field teams

   and field management, to provide support and to manage field teams and

   implementation performance.

12. Due to the many dependencies, and extensive lead times, associated with

   ensuring that installation of Horizon hardware, migration from legacy to Horizon

   and movement of the office to Live was achieved in a short window of time the

   start-up of national rollout had varying start dates (depending on the role of the

   supplier in the supply chain). The rollout at offices was ramped up over a period

   of weeks to achieve a steady implementation output rate of 300 offices per week,

   across 4 lP areas, resulting in a targeted 15-18 month rollout plan to the

   approximate 18,500 offices

13. The challenges to rollout planning were extensive and included areas such as

   availability / support of the post office management and staff (end users),

   availability of HFSO's, development of a migration process that was acceptable

   to POCL, successful completion of training, preparation of office infrastructure,

   dealing with unforeseen events (weather, robbery, illness, etc), arrival of

   hardware and hardware failures, Christmas and national holidays, POCL regional

   implementation views and requirements, etc. As explained in the strategy papers

   a pipeline of offices was created in a split implementation programme to ensure

   that infrastructure changes were made to create offices that were 'ready for

   install' and then through a second phase to installation and go-live. Due to the


                                    Page 5 of 32
                                                                                        WITNO3920100
                                                                                      W ITN03920100




   long lead-time of activities and the anticipated office dropout rate a larger number

   of offices entered the pipeline to ensure the maintenance of the required weekly

   implementation output beat rate.

14. To make an office Live on Horizon required the successful installation and

   activation of hardware, the recognition of the office at the ICL Pathway Data

   Centre, the successful completion of training by the office manager and staff, and

   the migration of stock I accounting data from the legacy process to create a

   known and agreed starting position for the office on the Horizon System. To

   facilitate this process ICL Pathway developed 2 solutions, known as MiMan and

   MiECCO.

15. MiMan was the process to be used for an office that did not have the legacy point

   of sale computer system; the vast majority of offices were required to utilise the

   MiMan data migration process. In simple terms, the MiMan migration required the

   manual preparation of stock unit and office balances and the manual entry of

   relevant stock and value data to the Horizon system. The establishment of

   Horizon through MiMan was to create the equivalent number of stock units in

   Horizon as had operated before Horizon. The overall stock, value, and

   accounting position once created in Horizon by the HFSO was validated with the

   office manager and formally agreed.

16. MiECCO was a system deployed in a relatively small number of larger directly

   managed Post Offices, approximately 700. Due to the fact that these offices

   already had an in office integrated point of sale system that managed

   transactions through to stock unit and office balancing; and the fact that these


                                    Page 6off32
                                                                                        WITN03920100
                                                                                      WI TN03920100




   were larger offices with multiple stock units, it was agreed that ICL Pathway

   would develop and automated solution to extract relevant data from the ECCO

   system and populate the Horizon system. As with MiMan, validation processes

   were required with office management to confirm successful migration of data.

17. Whilst MiMan and MiECCO dealt with the process to migrate stock and account

   data to Horizon there were other potential challenges in offices. There were

   approximately 26 different `systems', mostly counter but some back office that

   could be found in a Post Office. The 26 systems reflected the history of POCK in

   not having an integrated point of sale system and therefore, where there was a

   commercial benefit, implementing product specific solutions, for example an

   Automated Payment System. As part of the development of the in-office

   migration procedures a solution was developed for each of the 26 different

   systems; this solution led to processes that also formed part of the work of the

   HFSO. Whilst 26 systems may sound significant, the reality was that data had to

   be extracted from many of the systems to create the end of day or end of week

   account in offices and so the process was well understood. The multiple legacy

   systems became redundant.

19. The design of the Horizon system was documented in various high and low level

   design specifications and these were reviewed by POOL programme subject

   matter experts as well as POOL business subject matter experts. For me this is

   the first level of `testing that what is being built meets the contractual

   requirements, In my experience it is relatively straight forward to develop

   solutions that reflect the `happy path' of system processing, it is critical to look at

   what happens when things go wrong, the `unhappy path', and determine what

   steps need to be taken either manually or in system. Although I was not regularly

   involved I recall there being scenario workshops to assess the 'what if positions

   that might arise (e.g. a Horizon system goes down mid transaction).

20.1 have no direct knowledge of unit testing, end to end testing, integration testing,

   assurance walkthroughs but I understood that this was covered within the POOL

   team working with ICL Pathway

21.As the decision whether to proceed with implementation approached the Model

   Office / User Acceptance Testing became the point where end users and

   Business subject matter experts became involved. Obviously, the scope of

   services provided by POOL needed to be tested in a Model Office environment

   with real office staff involved. I believe that subpostmasters and staff from directly

   managed branches were involved.

22. The Model Office was created in Borough High Street, South London. The setup

   of the Model Office was I believe to create a number of different Post Office


                                      Page 8 of 32
                                                                                         WITNO3920100
                                                                                     WI TN03920100




   branch configurations that represented the different branch types in the Network.

   The Model Office was also the place where MiMan and MiECCO was tested and

   so was not purely focussed on Horizon business as usual.

23. The Model Office ran through agreed testing scripts that each had defined

   expected outcomes. The scope of testing covered the business day transactions,

   to end of day processing, to end of week or accounting period processing. To

   enable a faster testing cycle logical days were used so that an accounting week

   could effectively be completed in 1-2 days.

24. One significant benefit of the Model Office was that the users represented 'real

   people' who worked in branches and who were therefore non-technical and

   unpredictable. Users hitting keys in unexpected sequences or not following the

   expected process to system flow would identify additional defects.

25. Of course, the effectiveness of the Model Office was also dependent on a very

   clear understanding of the environments being used and their version number. In

   scenarios that tested integrations the reports highlight defects that were

   attributed to environment version incompatibility; I would expect that all such

   instances would have been resolved by re-running tests with environments

   running the appropriate versions.

26. In terms of test reports, it was critical that the test management team led by ICL

   Pathway (with POCK test management involvement) produced updated reports

   showing progress made in testing with number of test scripts run, tests passed

   and failed and a list of defects. Analysis and agreement needed to be made of

   the severity of test incidents and root cause analysis of incidents was


                                     Page 9 of 32

   undertaken. All significant incidents needed to be resolved through re-test and

   agreed clearance. Some minor defects would have deferred fixes agreed to be

   implemented post go-live, e.g. spelling errors or colour changes.

27. At the conclusion of the Model Office test phase a Business decision has to be

   made as to whether the system is sufficiently stable to allow a release into an

   operational environment. Safeguards should exist in the form of soft launch to

   small numbers of offices to ensure confidence before ramping up software

   rollout. There should also be a rollback plan available for an agreed period of

   time.

28.Ahead of the soft launch or Live Trial of Horizon ICL Pathway had to demonstrate

   that all defects that were agreed to be a priority had been fixed. There would

   have been a list of deferred fixes and these should have had details of when they

   would be fixed

29. Summer of 1999

   (Referring to POL00028475, POL00028478, POL00039646)

   By the Summer of 1999 ICL Pathway were pushing for contractual acceptance

   as this would trigger the commencement of Horizon national rollout; POCL were

   conscious that contractual acceptance was a major step and the granting of

   acceptance would remove significant leverage for changes and improvements

   ahead of a national rollout of Horizon. The number and categorisation of the

   significant defects had been the subject of continuous debate between the POCL

   and ICL Pathway management teams. The offices that were already live, the live

   proving offices, continued on Horizon and whilst there were early life challenges I

                                   Page 10 of 32
                                                                                        WITNO3920100
                                                                                    WI TN03920100




   have no knowledge of any incident or incidents that either on its own or in

   consideration with other incident suggested that the Horizon system was

   fundamentally flawed and / or throwing out erroneous accounting data.

30. From a POOL management perspective the quality of the training being provided

   by Peritas needed to be improved as subpostmasters and staff needed additional

   training time on the system. Additionally, the POOL national network of Retail

   Network Managers (RNM) also required a thorough understanding of the Horizon

   system and how it operated and so Horizon training for this group became a

   requirement. From a commercial perspective ICL Pathway were looking to

   minimise their exposure to any further additional costs. POOL required an

   improvement in the training and this was partly through an additional pre-training

   event, provision of training to RNMs, and improvements to the Horizon System

   Helpdesk (HSH),

31. In respect of the training course for both Counter Managers and Counter

   Assistants POOL requested that ICL Pathway amend course structure to improve

   the overall quality of both courses. From a commercial perspective POOL noted

   that ICL Pathway were saving cost on previously agreed course content because

   BES had been withdrawn from Programme scope and therefore time originally

   costed for BES training could be diverted to support changes to training course

   content.

32. In terms of contractual acceptance the number of outstanding incidents that

   required agreement with ICL Pathway had been reduced over time

   (POL00028478 references 9) to 9. Continuous monitoring was being undertaken


                                   Page 11 of 32
                                                                                               WITNO3920100

   on the offices live with Horizon and there was a caveat that any new and

   significant arising from the live trial offices could be added to the acceptance

   incident list if it was sufficiently significant. As a result of calls to the HSH tickets

   were being raised and these were under scrutiny by POCL and in fact

   acceptance incident 408 shows that the analysis of incidents had resulted in

   POCL requiring improvements to HSH support to end users.

33. POCL and ICL Pathway had a significantly different view of the severity of the 9

   contractual acceptance incidents. Owners were assigned to each incident and

   whilst I can only comment on the closure of incident 218 I can say that POCL

   senior management would have needed to formally accept that rectification of all

   the incidents had either been achieved or that an acceptable rectification plan

   was in place.

34. With regard to the 3 acceptance incidents that POCL deemed to be high severity

   it was my understanding that these needed to be resolved by ICL Pathway

   before POOL would consider the commencement of the national rollout of the

   Horizon system.

35. Action Taken By ICL

   During the period of Model Office testing and Live Proving (offices operating

   Releases IGL and I b, and subsequently 1c) there was joint working to record

   testing defects, through the Model Office testing process, and incidents arising at

   Live offices, through the HSHD process. ICL Pathway had appointed relevant

                                                                                     W ITN03920100




   managers and subject matter experts to analyse incidents to determine root

   cause. Incident severity was generally jointly agreed however there were

   instances where POCL had a view that incidents were more severe. As I

   understood the process ICL Pathway would develop fixes and these would be

   incorporated into testing; these could be software fixes or procedural fixes. POCL

   was involved, through Programme subject matter experts, in assuring the nature

   of the fix and closing defects via agreed test closure criteria. Given the number of

   tests and defects it was important to have a single point where all incidents,

   defects and progress to fix was held and maintained. The POCL programme

   team was also responsible for ensuring that POCL head office senior

   management and regional management was updated on progress.

36. In terms of unique number referencing for defects I believe that ICL Pathway

   utilised their in-house unique referencing system for defects and that this was, for

   joint test management and reporting purposes cross-referenced to a Model

   Office testing unique reference number system. In effect a defect could have 2

   unique reference numbers.

37. The development of the MiECCO automated migration tool was undertaken by

   ICL Pathway to avoid a lengthy manual in-office data migration process for larger

   Post Offices that operated the ECCO point of sale system. From a POCL

   operational perspective it was critical that data from ECCO was correctly mapped

   to the Horizon data tables such that the closing accounting position at each stock

   unit, and for the branch as a whole, could clearly be recognised in the opening

   position in Horizon stock units and overall for the office in Horizon. I was

                                                                                        WITNO3920100
                                                                                    WI TN03920100




   responsible within the POCL programme team for ensuring that ICL Pathway

   produced an effective and accurate migration tools and processes. To achieve

   this POCL provided subject matter experts for ECCO and from areas such as

   Finance and Operations and the Reference Data Team to support ICL Pathway

   development and provide assurance that the migration tool was fit for purpose.

   Once ICL Pathway had developed a version of MiECCO the tool was then

   reviewed and tested to ensure that MiECCO was capable of delivering the

   required outcome to support the national rollout        Horizon. ICL Pathway worked



                                                      of
   with POCL subject matter experts on defects and were responsible for

   implementing the changes In the MiECCO tool that would then be retested to

   confirm incident closure.

38.As with MiECCO, ICL Pathway undertook the development of the MiMan

  migration process, the difference is that this was a manual data migration

  process that required manual input of data into the Horizon system to create an

  opening operational and accounting position for a Horizon office. The vast

  majority of offices in the POCL network would follow the MiMan migration

  process. As with MiECCO it was critical that data from offices operating manual

  transaction management and accounting processes was correctly mapped and

  keyed into the Horizon data tables such that the closing office position could

  clearly be recognised and reconciled in the opening position in the Horizon office.

  Once ICL Pathway had developed the MiMan process it was then reviewed and

  tested to ensure that MiMan was capable          delivering the required outcome to
                                              of




  support the national rollout of Horizon. ICL Pathway worked with POCL subject

   matter experts on defects and were responsible for implementing the changes in

   the MiMan process that would then be retested to confirm incident closure. I

   believe that it is also worth highlighting that the POCL subject matter experts

   provided guidance to ICL Pathway on the mapping of data.

39. As MiMan was a migration process that required manual input of data into the

   Horizon system it was recognised that data keying errors were a risk. Manual

   validation steps were included in the migration process and the process required

   a positive confirmation from the HFSO and office manager that the Horizon

   opening position accurately reflected the manual office closing position. To deal

   with instances were an error had been made in manual migration a process was

   developed for HFSOs to follow.

40. In respect of defects identified and where the defects appear to suggest that the

   system is not following an appropriate workflow, for example where a user

   incorrectly entered their password and the system did not present a'retry

   password entry', ICL Pathway needed to update their detailed design

   specification and the development team then needed to make the appropriate

   changes to the system. To enable the management of changes ICL Pathway

   followed their internal software management processes and sometimes referred

   to Fagan reviews as part of their process.

41.As part of the Model Office testing reporting process there were instances where

   defects have been referred to as `NOT issues'. My understanding of this term is

   that they highlighted areas of particular POCL programme team concern.

   (Reference FUJ00078728, FUJ00079176, P0L00028470, P0L00028472)

   The Acceptance Workshops undertaken in August and September continued to

   focus on resolution to the 9 outstanding acceptance incidents. As the Champion'

   for Incident 218 the focus was on improvement to training for office staff and

   managers and support staff, Through multiple meeting sand discussions a

   rectification plan was developed to facilitate the closure of the Acceptance

   Incident 218. With regard to the rectification plan (referenced at page 1,

   FUJ00079176) I believe that the plan included changes to ensure training was

   provided to POOL Retail Network Managers; the introduction of a Pre

   assessment training (that I believe focussed on improving office manager training

   success rates); improved processes for monitoring and reporting training

   delivery; ways of encouraging the use of the Horizon training mode facility;

   processes for managing office managers who did not demonstrate the required

   level of competency.

43. With regard to the Acceptance Criteria and the decision to commence the

   national rollout of Horizon, my understanding is that the 9 Acceptance Incidents

   highlighted in acceptance meeting notes were the focus of senior management

   oversight and that the delivery of agreed rectification plans for each incident

   would facilitate a positive decision on the Horizon rollout. I cannot recall any

   changes made to the acceptance criteria ahead of the decision to rollout Horizon

   nationally.

44.At the time that POCL and ICL Pathway agreed to the national rollout of the

   Horizon system I believe that there was a general understanding, in the POCL

   central programme team and in the 4 national POOL IF implementation teams

   that the Horizon system was stable and operated with data integrity; that the

   major defects had been resolved; and, that the remaining known defects had fix

   resolution paths that were acceptable to business experts and stakeholders and

   taken either individually or collectively did not represent a risk to POOL

   operations, reputation or risk to any of the system users.

45. Rollout

   (Reference FUJ00001284, FUJ00001327, FUJ00001514, FUJ00001515,

   FUJ00058358, FUJ00001516, FUJ00058267, FUJ00058272)

   The development of the ICL Pathway strategy for the rollout of the Horizon

   system, including the split implementation approach covering infrastructure and

   then installation 1 migration, was a joint effort between ICL Pathway and the

   POOL Horizon programme team. The strategy was designed to find an optimum

   balance between a number of conflicting requirements; for example the ability of

   POCL regional operations to cope with change volume; the ability of support

   services to support change volume; the requirements for Christmas and Bank

   Holiday cessation; the cost of maintaining field teams; the availability of

   hardware; etc. To reach an agreed and documented implementation strategy

   involved the engagement of multiple stakeholders across POOL and the iterative

   refinement of the strategy over a long period of time leading to an agreed

   position.

46. Whilst, in isolation, every activity relating to the implementation of the Horizon

   system was relatively straightforward the complexity came with the logistical

   and 60,000 people                the              The ICL Pathway implementation

                          through
   strategy         effective; there was a recognition of the scale of the challenges and
              was




   there was a high degree of commitment from ICL Pathway and the POCL

   Horizon programme team to analyse and design processes that ensured a

   regular Horizon weekly rollout beat-rate, recognising in the implementation

   pipeline the many variables that could adversely impact the weekly

   implementation beat rate.

47. During the national Horizon rollout the POCL IP implementation teams deployed

   HFSOs to support individual offices and their staff through the cutover to the new

   system and were also thereto provide initial on-site support for the first 2 days of

   operational use of the system and the production of the first Cash Account. As a

   result of this on site presence the implementation teams and implementation

   management were aware of issues that arose in some offices. The issues were

   recorded and directed through the HSHD to enable incident analysis and closure.

   I do not believe that there was any sense that there were fundamental flaws with

   the Horizon system; issues / incidents were raised but my understanding was

   that these were either single incidents, or if common to a number of offices, that

   they were relatively minor and did not suggest problems with data integrity or

  system stability. Everyone in the POCL implementation team was aware that

  successful implementation was dependent on the Horizon system operating as

  expected and was mindful to ensure that all issues were raised for investigation.

48 Once an office passed through its' implementation and early HFSO support

   phase it entered operational business as usual. Once in business as usual the

   Horizon system support teams would be involved in incident analysis and

   appropriate follow up, Whilst I am sure that the POOL implementation team

   continued to be aware of issues within offices, I do not believe there was any

   sense that the issues were highlighting fundamental system flaws. All issues

   raised by users were taken seriously by the POCL implementation team; there

   was no advantage to anyone in the POCL implementation team in ignoring or

   misrepresenting any issue.

49. POOL senior management and the POCL Horizon team were obviously aware of

   the nature of the incidents that had been discussed at length as part of the

   contractual acceptance process. That national rollout of the Horizon system

   commenced was dependent on POCL senior management being satisfied that

   any outstanding Horizon issues were known and under control. During the rollout

   of the Horizon system senior POOL head office and regional management would

   have been updated on rollout progress and issues encountered through

   implementation and in business as usual operation. Whilst I believe that there

   must have been indicators of more fundamental issues with the Horizon system I

   find it difficult to believe that such indicators could all have been masked by the

   general noise associated with a large scale and complex system rollout.

50. The original objectives of the BA/POOL programme included the implementation

   of a benefits encashment system and the removal of this functionality, in line with




                                    Page 19 of 32

                                                                                  WI TN03920100




   the Benefits Agency decision to move towards direct bank transfer as a preferred

   method of benefit payment represented an adverse commercial impact to POCL.

51.The implementation of an integrated IT system that managed transactions and

   accounting from offices through to back end systems represented an achieved

   objective for POCL. An implementation of such scale and one that represented

   such a significant step change in the ways of working for so many people was

   always going to take time to embed into a new business as usual state however

   there was an understanding that change was required and a there was a positive

   view of the change across all stakeholder groups. As customers were starting to

  demand services that were more varied and faster and easier and more

  convenient to transact the implementation of the Horizon platform was an

  essential enabler for POCL/POL to develop such new products and services.

52. The IMPACT Programme

  (Reference P0L00038881, FUJ00090315, FUJ00091077, P0L00038909,

  P0L00038937, P0L00038986)

  I believe that the IMPACT Programme was driven by the need to simplify and

  update the many backend legacy systems to improve efficiency, accuracy, and

  lower operational costs. At the front end, in offices, the Programme also

  introduced the capability for Smart Card transactions and changed the Suspense

  Account process from manual to an automated process. The Releases also

  introduced various other changes to the Horizon System that were related to

  either products or service improvements.

53. My role in the IMPACT Programme was as the Change Management lead.

   Within the change management team were team members who represented

  different POCL business functions such as Operations. I believe that the change

   manager role for IMPACT included defining the change that users, in all POCL

   Functions, would have to make in their roles and providing training and support

  for this to happen. Change management would also be involved in ensuring that

   revised operational process documents were developed and distributed (in

  support of user training). It was also important that change management

   understood what, if any, one off migration or implementation activities might need

  to be undertaken to enable the changes to business as usual (again, the aim was

  to ensure that impacted system users were trained, had processes, and were

  supported). The change role also covered communications and the need to

  ensure that POCL management, and system users (whichever function they

  were in, or system that they used) had an understandable view, non-technical, of

  the changes that would be introduced. In support of other areas of the

  Programme the business change workstream would support user acceptance

  testing 1 Model Office testing and the development of functional acceptance

  criteria (used to validate functional readiness for implementation). Business

  change would help ensure that subject matter experts and stakeholders from

  business functions were involved in relevant reviews, for example design

  reviews. I believe that there was also an element of organisational design review

  involved in the IMPACT programme and business change would have been

  involved in ensuring that this process was followed through with organisational

   planning aligned to Programme milestones (for example managing people

   released from roles that no longer existed; or recruitment to new roles).

54. The IMPACT Programme changed the way that users interacted with the Horizon

   system in respect of changes to the Cash Account process and move to Branch

   Trading; the change to an automated process for the management of office

   discrepancies. I believe there were some enhancements to other areas of the

   Horizon system that would be noticeable by users (recognition beeps in the EMV

   card slot, British Forces Post Office [BFPO] selection in SmartPost) however not

   all changes involved a change of process and some changes related to creating

   enablers for future transactions (handling bank Smart cards for payments).

55. With regard to CR272 I am unable to provide an explanation of the background

   to the specified changes; this would have been developed by the POOL design

   team as part of the process associated with developing the Change Work

   Package 0290 (reference FUJ00090315). I can confirm that the nature of the

   changes would have been evaluated by the business change team to confirm

   any people or process impacts.

56. With regard to CR276 I am unable to provide an explanation of the background

   to the specified changes; this would have been developed by the POOL design

   team as part of the process associated with developing the Change Work

   Package 0290 (reference FUJ00090315). I confirm that the nature of the

   changes would have been evaluated by the business change team to confirm

   any people or process impacts.

57. Within the scope of the S80 Release changes were introduced that moved office

    accounting away from weekly Cash Account production to Trading Periods and

   also introduced an automated process to manage Unclaimed Payments and

    Uncharged Receipts that existed as the office level Suspense Account. Up until

   the S80 Release errors made by office in transacting business had been dealt

   with through a paper process that required office managers to post details (enter

   details) of the Error Notices into the Suspense Account; S80 introduced an

   automated posting process. This improvement meant that the risk of office errors

   relating to amounts manually posted to Suspense Accounts was mitigated and

   the overall time taken for error notice processing was reduced,

58. The introduction of Trading Periods in offices did not change the concept of

   producing a formal statement of activity within an agreed time period however it

   was a new process to be followed.

59. In terms of engagement with end users in any business function impacted by the

   IMPACT Programme I am unable to list and specify the details of engagement

   however the role of the change manager, and the change management

   functional representatives, was to ensure that end users were engaged and

   supporting management staff were engaged in the design and testing of the

   changes. The Programme, and POL. management recognised, that user input

   was an important element of ensuring a good user interface and user experience.

60. Whilst I am unable to reference specific notes, or documents, I can confirm that

   user feedback was important to the IMPACT Programme team and that feedback

   would have been taken on board and acted upon where appropriate. The

  feedback would have included comment on User Interface such as screen

  workflow, colours, positioning on screen, understanding of language used in

  instructions. There would also have been feedback gleaned from users

  interacting with the testing team with the aim of reducing the risk of errors. Whilst

  I cannot provide any specific example I am sure that not all user feedback was

  accepted; for example if a user disagreed with a fundamental aspect of the

  concept, the business design, I believe that the overall business benefit to POL

  would have been the over-riding necessity.

61.General

  Reflecting on the testing, trial, and formal acceptance of the Horizon system I can

  say that a significant amount of effort was put in by staff in the BA/POCL

  Programme, staff in POLL regions, and office staff to support testing and trials.

  The development phase of the programme spanned years and this reflected the

  complexity of the scope of work as well as changes of sponsorship structure

  when the Benefits Agency withdrew. The formal acceptance of Horizon was also

  an extensive process with input from many Programme subject matter experts. I

  have reflected on the question of the effectiveness of the assurance and scrutiny

  that was undertaken in the Programme and, obviously, in light of the flaws that

  have been exposed in the Horizon System it was not sufficient. Being involved in

  the Programme from the Request for Proposal (RfP) stage through to

  implementation I worked with many capable people who were fully committed to

  delivering a robust system and, whilst not ignorant of the cost impacts of the time

   taken, were not discouraged from raising challenges where issues were

   identified.

62. During the Horizon Programme processes were executed across workstreams to

   capture and manage issues as they arose. I believe that there was recognition

   across the Programme that issue management was an important process and I

   have no sense that there was any conscious effort to hide issues. In a complex

   programme many issues will arise and, whilst there was, in my opinion, a robust

   process for issues management I now question whether there was a focus on

   managing the many individual issues at the expense of some level of deeper

   analysis of root cause and potential relationship between issues.

63. At the point that formal Acceptance was discussed between POCL and ICL

   Pathway in 1999 there pressure was being applied by ICL Pathway management

   to close all the outstanding Incidents. From my involvement in the Acceptance

   Process I always felt confident that the POCL acceptance managers were

   prepared to move to acceptance only if the Acceptance Incidents had been

   closed, or had plans to close, in an appropriate and acceptable way, a way that

   did not represent risk to POCL as a business or to users of the system. On

   reflection, looking back to the 9 Acceptance Incidents that were the focus of

   attention in Summer 1999 it seems that perhaps we did not fully understand the

   critical issues.

64. In terms of interaction with key stakeholders who would use or be directly

   impacted by the introduction of the Horizon System there was extensive

   interaction. ICL Pathway also recruited at least one sub postmaster to support

   their understanding of user needs. Input and ongoing engagement was

   undertaken with all POOL business functions, and whilst they were involved in

   the BA / POCL Programme, the Benefits Agency. National Federation of

   Subpostmasters (NFSP), Communication Managers Association, Communication

   Workers Union were also involved as key stakeholders with regular interaction.

   There was great support for the concept that the BA/POCL Programme

   represented.

65. Changes were made to the Horizon System for various reasons; for example to

   fix identified defects, to implement deferred fixes, to introduce new products, to

   deliver POOL / POL strategic imperatives such as new capabilities or business

   efficiencies. In the Horizon Programme there was significant engagement with,

   and feedback from, end users. The IMPACT Programme also had engagement

   and interaction with end users. I believe that business as usual fixes would have

   involved less end user participation (but would still go through rigorous testing).

66. On reflection it appears that (perhaps) there was a weakness in the depth and

   breadth of the analysis of incidents that end users were reporting to the HSHD.

   POL Audit were also identifying apparent office discrepancies but it is unclear to

   me whether there was any trend data that might have suggested unusual

   patterns associated with the increased number of such discrepancies post the

   implementation of the Horizon System or post any Horizon Release. From a

   different perspective POOL / POL regional operational management would have

   had long term relationships with subpostmasters and some of the discrepancies

   would, I expect, have caused questions to be raised about legitimacy. In

   summary, I feel that there should have been threads of data / information that

   might have resulted in earlier identification of fundamental issues but such

   threads were not, to my knowledge recognised or brought together.

67. The scope of the Horizon Programme was significant and at the time of the

   contract award it was suggested to be the largest infrastructure project in Europe

   outside of military initiatives. In terms of reflection on the original scope it was

   clear at the time that the Benefits Agency and POCL had differing strategic aims;

   for POCL the delivery of an integrated point of sale system that secured benefits

   encashment business through BES functionality was the desired outcome; it

   seemed that the Benefits Agency had a desired strategic outcome that moved

   benefit payment to direct credit transfer to recipients bank accounts. For a

   Programme of this scale, with 2 different sponsoring organisations (BA and

   POCL), it seemed unfortunate desired strategic outcomes of the sponsors were

   incompatible.

68. In terms of the sourcing process the sponsor is seeking the optimum outcome

   from a commercial and technical perspective in the appointment of a partner /

   supplier. In the sourcing process it was not clear to me how the financial

   evaluation weighting was given such priority over the technical evaluation as to

   lead to the contract being offered to ICL Pathway. I acknowledge that there has

   to be a balance between commercial and technical evaluation outcomes and

   ultimately, perhaps, the appointment of a different partner may have led to the

   same outcome.

    69. In terms of the Horizon Programme and reflecting on the scope and risk involved,

        and the number of years effort invested in the change, I now wonder whether the

        risk analysis associated with the ICL Pathway approach to development and

        implementation might have driven a different approach. I have no doubt that

        POCL management at the time considered the risks associated with the

        proposed development and implementation path however one possibility would

        have been to find a way to decompose the scope of the Programme into smaller

        projects that might have carried less risk.

    70. In preparing this statement I feel that I am actually no wiser in understanding the

        root causes of the system instability or lack of data integrity. It seems likely that

        there were multiple causes and it is important to try and understand the detail to

        help avoid such outcomes in the future. The adverse impacts on people who

        used and trusted the Horizon System are shocking and something for which I am

        deeply sorry. Nobody in the Horizon Programme, or the IMPACT Programme,

        had any intention of designing or implementing a system that had fundamental

        flaws.
