POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF STEPHEN ROBERT GRAYSTON

|, Stephen Robert Grayston, in response to the Rule 9 request from the Post Office

Horizon IT Inquiry, dated 05 August 2022, will say as follows:

1.

| was employed by Royal Mail Group (RMG), Post Office Counters Limited
(POCL), from January 1986 until the formal separation of Post Office Ltd from
Royal Mail Group in April 2012 whereupon | moved to the Royal Mail Group IT
function. In 2018 | left Royal Mail Group. Since leaving Royal Mail Group, | have
worked as IT Director and Chief Information Officer for a non-UK postal services

provider and | am currently an IT Advisor working outside of the UK.

. During my career with RMG | undertook various roles. From 1989 to 1995, | was

an Investigation Office with RMG, which involved investigating irregularities
deemed significant in operations within the RMG companies. in 1995, | was
appointed as a manager in the BA/POCL Programme that was in the process of

being established in Terminal House, Grosvenor Gardens, London.

3. My initial work on the BA/POCL Programme was as part of the evaluation team
reviewing supplier proposals for the provision of an integrated point of sale postal
retail system and also (originally) scoped to replace the legacy paper token
based payment of benefits with a Smart Card based encashment system. My
initial area of work was to assess the supplier capability for the provision of end
user help desk and support services. The result of the sourcing process identified
ICL Pathway as the contracted partner for the delivery of the Programme and
subsequent maintenance in steady state operations.

4. As the Inquiry will already know the scope of the contract for services with ICL
Pathway changed and the Programme was restructured when the Benefits
Agency withdrew. It was during this period that the Programme was renamed
from BA / POCL to Horizon.

5. As the Programme moved forwards the nature of my role changed. | undertook
the role of in-office migration manager, which required the assurance of the
supplier solutions to migrate stock and accounting data to the new Horizon
system in each Post Office. | was then part of the central team that managed the
Horizon implementation plan working with ICL Pathway and the 4 POCL Horizon
implementation teams. Following rollout of Horizon, | was appointed to work as a
Change Manager for the upgrade Programme that | believe was called IMPACT.

6. Within the IMPACT Programme, as Change Manager, my role was to understand
the nature of the changes to front and back office processes, the nature of the
cutover to the upgraded services, and developing people engagement,

communications and training with support from POCL functional representatives.

WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

As part of the team effort, the role also required support in the provision of end
users in User Acceptance Testing.

. The early stages of the BA/POCL Programme had many challenges such as the
supplier ramping up with sufficient capable resources and the various
programme teams becoming established. Work was conducted in ICL Pathway's
Feltham facility and Terminal House and meetings were undertaken with POCL
and Benefits Agency business function representatives. Change management
was established and engagement with staff and various representative bodies
was developed. The scope and scale of the Programme was significant, | believe
that it was sometimes referred to as the largest infrastructure Programme in
Europe, outside of military contracts.

. Software Releases and the effects of such releases
(Referring to FUJ00058348, FUJ00058333, FUJ00058331, FUJ00078114.)

The first Release of the BA/POCL Programme was, in my view, part of the
confidence building exercise for stakeholders. The Initial Go-Live (IGL) Release
was to 10 offices located in the South Wales / South West of England and
provided a standalone Benefits Encashment Service (BES). From memory the
BES was based on a small number of volunteer Child Benefit recipients agreeing
to use a Smart Card to enable them to access their benefits in 10 selected post
offices. The BES ran alongside legacy services with an appropriate adjustment to
the end of week accounting process to reflect both BES transactions and legacy
paper token benefits transactions. This Release was known as Initial Go-Live

(IGL) and as Release 1a.

WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

9. The Programme developed a solution for the validation of paper-based tokens;
this was known as the Order Book Control Service (OBCS). Whilst IGL continued
in live operation a group of offices was identified, approximately 200 in total, to
undertake the OBCS as part of a Release 1b. From memory, the OBCS also ran
in parallel to legacy services and so there was no in-office migration or
decommissioning of other systems.

10. | cannot recall the background details however, a decision was made to bring all
IGL and Release 1b offices on to the same operating baseline and this was the
scope of Release 1c. This impacted approximately 210 offices only. The
migration to Release 1c (as with all Releases) required a careful co-ordination of
activities that involved multiple partners both internal to POCL and external with
supplier teams.

1

. The experiences of the IGL, Release 1b and Release 1c provided input to the
design of the implementation plan. One of the critical areas within the plan was
how to optimise support to branch managers and staff at the point of Horizon
implementation and go-live. Under the contract with ICL Pathway, the obligation
for support of offices through transition and into Live lay with ICL Pathway. Due
to the extensive knowledge of regional operational staff in respect of POCL
culture, processes and general operations a contract change was agreed with
ICL Pathway whereby POCL would provide Horizon Field Support Officers
(HFSO's), managed through each of the 4 national implementation teams (IP1 to
IP4), to support the agreed Horizon rollout plan. Effectively POCL were sub

contracted to provide support to the rollout of Horizon to meet ICL Pathway

Page 4 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

contractual obligations to POCL. The result of the change was that a stream of
work was developed to define the role of the HFSO, define relevant service
metrics and management information / reporting, to recruit and train field teams
and field management, to provide support and to manage field teams and
implementation performance.

12. Due to the many dependencies, and extensive lead times, associated with
ensuring that installation of Horizon hardware, migration from legacy to Horizon
and movement of the office to Live was achieved in a short window of time the
start-up of national rollout had varying start dates (depending on the role of the
supplier in the supply chain). The rollout at offices was ramped up over a period
of weeks to achieve a steady implementation output rate of 300 offices per week,
across 4 IP areas, resulting in a targeted 15-18 month rollout plan to the
approximate 18,500 offices

43. The challenges to rollout planning were extensive and included areas such as
availability / support of the post office management and staff (end users),
availability of HFSO's, development of a migration process that was acceptable
to POCL, successful completion of training, preparation of office infrastructure,
dealing with unforeseen events (weather, robbery, illness, etc), arrival of
hardware and hardware failures, Christmas and national holidays, POCL regional
implementation views and requirements, etc. As explained in the strategy papers
a pipeline of offices was created in a split implementation programme to ensure
that infrastructure changes were made to create offices that were ’ready for

install’ and then through a second phase to installation and go-live. Due to the

Page 5 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

long lead-time of activities and the anticipated office dropout rate a larger number
of offices entered the pipeline to ensure the maintenance of the required weekly
implementation output beat rate.

14.To make an office Live on Horizon required the successful installation and
activation of hardware, the recognition of the office at the ICL Pathway Data
Centre, the successful completion of training by the office manager and staff, and
the migration of stock / accounting data from the legacy process to create a
known and agreed starting position for the office on the Horizon System. To
facilitate this process ICL Pathway developed 2 solutions, known as MiMan and
MiECCO.

15.MiMan was the process to be used for an office that did not have the legacy point
of sale computer system; the vast majority of offices were required to utilise the
MiMan data migration process. In simple terms, the MiMan migration required the
manual preparation of stock unit and office balances and the manual entry of
relevant stock and value data to the Horizon system. The establishment of
Horizon through MiMan was to create the equivalent number of stock units in
Horizon as had operated before Horizon. The overall stock, value, and
accounting position once created in Horizon by the HFSO was validated with the
office manager and formally agreed.

16. MiECCO was a system deployed in a relatively small number of larger directly
managed Post Offices, approximately 700. Due to the fact that these offices
already had an in office integrated point of sale system that managed

transactions through to stock unit and office balancing; and the fact that these

Page 6 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

were larger offices with multiple stock units, it was agreed that ICL Pathway
would develop and automated solution to extract relevant data from the ECCO
system and populate the Horizon system. As with MiMan, validation processes
were required with office management to confirm successful migration of data.

17.Whilst MiMan and MiECCO dealt with the process to migrate stock and account
data to Horizon there were other potential challenges in offices. There were
approximately 26 different ‘systems’, mostly counter but some back office that
could be found in a Post Office. The 26 systems reflected the history of POCL in
not having an integrated point of sale system and therefore, where there was a
commercial benefit, implementing product specific solutions, for example an
Automated Payment System. As part of the development of the in-office
migration procedures a solution was developed for each of the 26 different
systems; this solution led to processes that also formed part of the work of the
HFSO. Whilst 26 systems may sound significant, the reality was that data had to
be extracted from many of the systems to create the end of day or end of week
account in offices and so the process was well understood. The multiple legacy
systems became redundant.

18. Pilot and Testing of the Horizon System

(Referring to Exhibits WITN0392_01/5 - WITN0392_01/25, respectively:

FUJ00078636.)

19. The design of the Horizon system was documented in various high and low level
design specifications and these were reviewed by POCL programme subject
matter experts as well as POCL business subject matter experts. For me this is
the first level of ‘testing’ that what is being built meets the contractual
requirements. In my experience it is relatively straight forward to develop
solutions that reflect the ‘happy path’ of system processing, it is critical to look at
what happens when things go wrong, the ‘unhappy path’, and determine what
steps need to be taken either manually or in system. Although | was not regularly
involved | recall there being scenario workshops to assess the ‘what if positions
that might arise (e.g. a Horizon system goes down mid transaction).

20.| have no direct knowledge of unit testing, end to end testing, integration testing,
assurance walkthroughs but | understood that this was covered within the POCL
team working with ICL Pathway

21.As the decision whether to proceed with implementation approached the Model
Office / User Acceptance Testing became the point where end users and
Business subject matter experts became involved. Obviously, the scope of
services provided by POCL needed to be tested in a Model Office environment
with real office staff involved. | believe that subpostmasters and staff from directly
managed branches were involved.

22. The Model Office was created in Borough High Street, South London. The setup

of the Model Office was | believe to create a number of different Post Office

Page 8 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

branch configurations that represented the different branch types in the Network.
The Model Office was also the place where MiMan and MiECCO was tested and
so was not purely focussed on Horizon business as usual.

23. The Model Office ran through agreed testing scripts that each had defined
expected outcomes. The scope of testing covered the business day transactions,
to end of day processing, to end of week or accounting period processing. To
enable a faster testing cycle logical days were used so that an accounting week
could effectively be completed in 1-2 days.

24. One significant benefit of the Model Office was that the users represented ‘real
people’ who worked in branches and who were therefore non-technical and
unpredictable. Users hitting keys in unexpected sequences or not following the
expected process to system flow would identify additional defects.

25. Of course, the effectiveness of the Model Office was also dependent on a very
clear understanding of the environments being used and their version number. In
scenarios that tested integrations the reports highlight defects that were
attributed to environment version incompatibility; | would expect that all such
instances would have been resolved by re-running tests with environments
running the appropriate versions.

26. In terms of test reports, it was critical that the test management team led by ICL
Pathway (with POCL test management involvement) produced updated reports
showing progress made in testing with number of test scripts run, tests passed
and failed and a list of defects. Analysis and agreement needed to be made of

the severity of test incidents and root cause analysis of incidents was

Page 9 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

undertaken. All significant incidents needed to be resolved through re-test and
agreed clearance. Some minor defects would have deferred fixes agreed to be
implemented post go-live, e.g. spelling errors or colour changes.

27. At the conclusion of the Model Office test phase a Business decision has to be
made as to whether the system is sufficiently stable to allow a release into an
operational environment. Safeguards should exist in the form of soft launch to
small numbers of offices to ensure confidence before ramping up software
rollout. There should also be a rollback plan available for an agreed period of
time.

28. Ahead of the soft launch or Live Trial of Horizon ICL Pathway had to demonstrate
that all defects that were agreed to be a priority had been fixed. There would
have been a list of deferred fixes and these should have had details of when they
would be fixed

29.Summer of 1999
(Referring to POL00028475, POL00028478, POL00039646)

By the Summer of 1999 ICL Pathway were pushing for contractual acceptance
as this would trigger the commencement of Horizon national rollout; POCL were
conscious that contractual acceptance was a major step and the granting of
acceptance would remove significant leverage for changes and improvements
ahead of a national rollout of Horizon. The number and categorisation of the
significant defects had been the subject of continuous debate between the POCL.
and ICL Pathway management teams. The offices that were already live, the live

proving offices, continued on Horizon and whilst there were early life challenges |

a

WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

have no knowledge of any incident or incidents that either on its own or in
consideration with other incident suggested that the Horizon system was

fundamentally flawed and / or throwing out erroneous accounting data.

From a POCL management perspective the quality of the training being provided
by Peritas needed to be improved as subpostmasters and staff needed additional
training time on the system. Additionally, the POCL national network of Retail
Network Managers (RNM) also required a thorough understanding of the Horizon
system and how it operated and so Horizon training for this group became a
requirement. From a commercial perspective ICL Pathway were looking to
minimise their exposure to any further additional costs. POCL required an
improvement in the training and this was partly through an additional pre-training
event, provision of training to RNMs, and improvements to the Horizon System
Helpdesk (HSH).

In respect of the training course for both Counter Managers and Counter
Assistants POCL requested that ICL Pathway amend course structure to improve
the overall quality of both courses. From a commercial perspective POCL noted
that ICL Pathway were saving cost on previously agreed course content because
BES had been withdrawn from Programme scope and therefore time originally
costed for BES training could be diverted to support changes to training course

content.

32. In terms of contractual acceptance the number of outstanding incidents that

required agreement with ICL Pathway had been reduced over time

(POL00028478 references 9) to 9. Continuous monitoring was being undertaken

Page 11 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

on the offices live with Horizon and there was a caveat that any new and
significant arising from the live trial offices could be added to the acceptance
incident list if it was sufficiently significant. As a result of calls to the HSH tickets
were being raised and these were under scrutiny by POCL and in fact
acceptance incident 408 shows that the analysis of incidents had resulted in
POCL requiring improvements to HSH support to end users.

33.POCL and ICL Pathway had a significantly different view of the severity of the 9
contractual acceptance incidents. Owners were assigned to each incident and
whilst | can only comment on the closure of incident 218 | can say that POCL
senior management would have needed to formally accept that rectification of all
the incidents had either been achieved or that an acceptable rectification plan
was in place.

34. With regard to the 3 acceptance incidents that POCL deemed to be high severity
it was my understanding that these needed to be resolved by ICL Pathway
before POCL would consider the commencement of the national roflout of the
Horizon system.

35.Action Taken By ICL

(Reference FUJ00078607, FUJ00078728, FUJ00023989, FUJ00024674,

POL00028342, POL00028478)

During the period of Model Office testing and Live Proving (offices operating
Releases IGL and 1b, and subsequently 1c) there was joint working to record
testing defects, through the Model Office testing process, and incidents arising at

Live offices, through the HSHD process. ICL Pathway had appointed relevant

Page 12 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

managers and subject matter experts to analyse incidents to determine root
cause. Incident severity was generally jointly agreed however there were
instances where POCL had a view that incidents were more severe. As |
understood the process ICL Pathway would develop fixes and these would be
incorporated into testing; these could be software fixes or procedural fixes. POCL
was involved, through Programme subject matter experts, in assuring the nature
of the fix and closing defects via agreed test closure criteria. Given the number of
tests and defects it was important to have a single point where all incidents,
defects and progress to fix was held and maintained. The POCL programme
team was also responsible for ensuring that POCL head office senior

management and regional management was updated on progress.

36.In terms of unique number referencing for defects | believe that ICL Pathway
utilised their in-house unique referencing system for defects and that this was, for
joint test management and reporting purposes cross-referenced to a Model
Office testing unique reference number system. In effect a defect could have 2
unique reference numbers.

37. The development of the MiIECCO automated migration tool was undertaken by
ICL Pathway to avoid a lengthy manual in-office data migration process for larger
Post Offices that operated the ECCO point of sale system. From a POCL
operational perspective it was critical that data from ECCO was correctly mapped
to the Horizon data tables such that the closing accounting position at each stock
unit, and for the branch as a whole, could clearly be recognised in the opening

position in Horizon stock units and overall for the office in Horizon. | was

Page 13 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

responsible within the POCL programme team for ensuring that ICL Pathway
produced an effective and accurate migration tools and processes. To achieve
this POCL provided subject matter experts for ECCO and from areas such as
Finance and Operations and the Reference Data Team to support ICL Pathway
development and provide assurance that the migration tool was fit for purpose.
Once ICL Pathway had developed a version of MiECCO the tool was then
reviewed and tested to ensure that MiIECCO was capable of delivering the
required outcome to support the national rollout of Horizon. iCL Pathway worked
with POCL subject matter experts on defects and were responsible for
implementing the changes in the MiECCO tool that would then be retested to
confirm incident closure.

38.As with MIECCO, ICL Pathway undertook the development of the MiMan
migration process, the difference is that this was a manual data migration
process that required manual input of data into the Horizon system to create an
opening operational and accounting position for a Horizon office. The vast
majority of offices in the POCL network would follow the MiMan migration
process. As with MiECCO it was critical that data from offices operating manual
transaction management and accounting processes was correctly mapped and
keyed into the Horizon data tables such that the closing office position could
clearly be recognised and reconciled in the opening position in the Horizon office.
Once ICL Pathway had developed the MiMan process it was then reviewed and
tested to ensure that MiMan was capable of delivering the required outcome to

support the national rollout of Horizon. ICL Pathway worked with POCL subject

Page 14 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

matter experts on defects and were responsible for implementing the changes in
the MiMan process that would then be retested to confirm incident closure. |
believe that it is also worth highlighting that the POCL subject matter experts
provided guidance to ICL Pathway on the mapping of data.

39. As MiMan was a migration process that required manual input of data into the
Horizon system it was recognised that data keying errors were a risk. Manual
validation steps were included in the migration process and the process required
a positive confirmation from the HFSO and office manager that the Horizon
opening position accurately reflected the manual office closing position. To deal
with instances were an error had been made in manual migration a process was
developed for HFSOs to follow.

40. In respect of defects identified and where the defects appear to suggest that the
system is not following an appropriate workflow, for example where a user
incorrectly entered their password and the system did not present a ‘retry
password entry’, ICL Pathway needed to update their detailed design
specification and the development team then needed to make the appropriate
changes to the system. To enable the management of changes ICL Pathway
followed their internal software management processes and sometimes referred
to Fagan reviews as part of their process.

a

.As part of the Model Office testing reporting process there were instances where
defects have been referred to as ‘HOT issues’. My understanding of this term is
that they highlighted areas of particular POCL programme team concern.

42. Acceptance Criteria

Page 15 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

(Reference FUJ00078728, FUJ00079176, POL00028470, POL00028472)

The Acceptance Workshops undertaken in August and September continued to
focus on resolution to the 9 outstanding acceptance incidents. As the ‘Champion’
for Incident 218 the focus was on improvement to training for office staff and
managers and support staff. Through multiple meeting sand discussions a
rectification plan was developed to facilitate the closure of the Acceptance
Incident 218. With regard to the rectification plan (referenced at page 1,
FUJ000791 76) | believe that the plan included changes to ensure training was
provided to POCL Retail Network Managers; the introduction of a Pre
assessment training (that | believe focussed on improving office manager training
success rates); improved processes for monitoring and reporting training
delivery; ways of encouraging the use of the Horizon training mode facility;
processes for managing office managers who did not demonstrate the required
level of competency.

43. With regard to the Acceptance Criteria and the decision to commence the
national rollout of Horizon, my understanding is that the 9 Acceptance Incidents
highlighted in acceptance meeting notes were the focus of senior management
oversight and that the delivery of agreed rectification plans for each incident
would facilitate a positive decision on the Horizon rollout. | cannot recall any
changes made to the acceptance criteria ahead of the decision to rollout Horizon
nationally.

44. At the time that POCL and ICL Pathway agreed to the national rollout of the

Horizon system | believe that there was a general understanding, in the POCL

Page 16 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

central programme team and in the 4 national POCL IP implementation teams
that the Horizon system was stable and operated with data integrity; that the
major defects had been resolved; and, that the remaining known defects had fix
resolution paths that were acceptable to business experts and stakeholders and
taken either individually or collectively did not represent a risk to POCL
operations, reputation or risk to any of the system users.

45. Rollout

(Reference FUJ00001284, FUJ00001327, FUJ00001514, FUJ00001515,

FUJ00058358, FUJ00001516, FUJ00058267, FUJ00058272)

The development of the ICL Pathway strategy for the rollout of the Horizon
system, including the split implementation approach covering infrastructure and
then installation / migration, was a joint effort between ICL Pathway and the
POCL Horizon programme team. The strategy was designed to find an optimum
balance between a number of conflicting requirements; for example the ability of
POCL regional operations to cope with change volume; the ability of support
services to support change volume; the requirements for Christmas and Bank
Holiday cessation; the cost of maintaining field teams; the availability of
hardware; etc. To reach an agreed and documented implementation strategy
involved the engagement of multiple stakeholders across POCL and the iterative
refinement of the strategy over a long period of time leading to an agreed

position.

46. Whilst, in isolation, every activity relating to the implementation of the Horizon

system was relatively straightforward the complexity came with the logistical

Page 17 of 32
WITNO3920100
WITNO3920100

challenges associated with managing 18,000+ offices, 40,000 counter positions
and 60,000 people through the process. The ICL Pathway implementation
strategy was effective; there was a recognition of the scale of the challenges and
there was a high degree of commitment from ICL Pathway and the POCL
Horizon programme team to analyse and design processes that ensured a
regular Horizon weekly rollout beat-rate, recognising in the implementation
pipeline the many variables that could adversely impact the weekly
implementation beat rate.

47. During the national Horizon rollout the POCL IP implementation teams deployed
HFSOs to support individual offices and their staff through the cutover to the new
system and were also there to provide initial on-site support for the first 2 days of
operational use of the system and the production of the first Cash Account. As a
result of this on site presence the implementation teams and implementation
management were aware of issues that arose in some offices. The issues were
recorded and directed through the HSHD to enable incident analysis and closure.
| do not believe that there was any sense that there were fundamental flaws with
the Horizon system; issues / incidents were raised but my understanding was
that these were either single incidents, or if common to a number of offices, that
they were relatively minor and did not suggest problems with data integrity or
system stability. Everyone in the POCL implementation team was aware that
successful implementation was dependent on the Horizon system operating as

expected and was mindful to ensure that all issues were raised for investigation.
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

48. Once an office passed through its’ implementation and early HFSO support
phase it entered operational business as usual. Once in business as usual the
Horizon system support teams would be involved in incident analysis and
appropriate follow up. Whilst | am sure that the POCL implementation team
continued to be aware of issues within offices, | do not believe there was any
sense that the issues were highlighting fundamental system flaws. All issues
raised by users were taken seriously by the POCL implementation team; there
was no advantage to anyone in the POCL implementation team in ignoring or
misrepresenting any issue.

49.POCL senior management and the POCL Horizon team were obviously aware of
the nature of the incidents that had been discussed at length as part of the
contractual acceptance process. That national rollout of the Horizon system
commenced was dependent on POCL senior management being satisfied that
any outstanding Horizon issues were known and under control. During the rollout
of the Horizon system senior POCL head office and regional management would
have been updated on rollout progress and issues encountered through
implementation and in business as usual operation. Whilst | believe that there
must have been indicators of more fundamental issues with the Horizon system |
find it difficult to believe that such indicators could all have been masked by the
general noise associated with a large scale and complex system rollout.

50. The original objectives of the BA/POCL programme included the implementation

of a benefits encashment system and the removal of this functionality, in line with

Page 19 of 32
5

=

WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

the Benefits Agency decision to move towards direct bank transfer as a preferred

method of benefit payment represented an adverse commercial impact to POCL.

. The implementation of an integrated IT system that managed transactions and

accounting from offices through to back end systems represented an achieved
objective for POCL. An implementation of such scale and one that represented
such a significant step change in the ways of working for so many people was
always going to take time to embed into a new business as usual state however
there was an understanding that change was required and a there was a positive
view of the change across all stakeholder groups. As customers were starting to
demand services that were more varied and faster and easier and more
convenient to transact the implementation of the Horizon platform was an

essential enabler for POCL/POL to develop such new products and services.

52. The IMPACT Programme

(Reference POL00038881, FUJ00090315, FUJ00091077, POL00038909,

POL00038937, POL00038986)

| believe that the IMPACT Programme was driven by the need to simplify and
update the many backend legacy systems to improve efficiency, accuracy, and
lower operational costs. At the front end, in offices, the Programme also
introduced the capability for Smart Card transactions and changed the Suspense
Account process from manual to an automated process. The Releases also
introduced various other changes to the Horizon System that were related to

either products or service improvements.

53. My role in the IMPACT Programme was as the Change Management lead.
Within the change management team were team members who represented
different POCL business functions such as Operations. | believe that the change
manager role for IMPACT included defining the change that users, in all POCL
Functions, would have to make in their roles and providing training and support
for this to happen. Change management would also be involved in ensuring that
revised operational process documents were developed and distributed (in
support of user training). It was also important that change management
understood what, if any, one off migration or implementation activities might need
to be undertaken to enable the changes to business as usual (again, the aim was
to ensure that impacted system users were trained, had processes, and were
supported). The change role also covered communications and the need to
ensure that POCL management, and system users (whichever function they
were in, or system that they used) had an understandable view, non-technical, of
the changes that would be introduced. In support of other areas of the
Programme the business change workstream would support user acceptance
testing / Model Office testing and the development of functional acceptance
criteria (used to validate functional readiness for implementation). Business
change would help ensure that subject matter experts and stakeholders from
business functions were involved in relevant reviews, for example design
reviews. | believe that there was also an element of organisational design review
involved in the IMPACT programme and business change would have been

involved in ensuring that this process was followed through with organisational

Page 21 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

planning aligned to Programme milestones (for example managing people
released from roles that no longer existed; or recruitment to new roles).

54. The IMPACT Programme changed the way that users interacted with the Horizon
system in respect of changes to the Cash Account process and move to Branch
Trading; the change to an automated process for the management of office
discrepancies. | believe there were some enhancements to other areas of the
Horizon system that would be noticeable by users (recognition beeps in the EMV
card slot, British Forces Post Office [BFPO] selection in SmartPost) however not
all changes involved a change of process and some changes related to creating
enablers for future transactions (handling bank Smart cards for payments).

55. With regard to CR272 | am unable to provide an explanation of the background
to the specified changes; this would have been developed by the POCL design
team as part of the process associated with developing the Change Work
Package 0290 (reference FUJ00090315). | can confirm that the nature of the
changes would have been evaluated by the business change team to confirm
any people or process impacts.

56. With regard to CR276 | am unable to provide an explanation of the background
to the specified changes; this would have been developed by the POCL design
team as part of the process associated with developing the Change Work
Package 0290 (reference FUJ00090315). | confirm that the nature of the
changes would have been evaluated by the business change team to confirm

any people or process impacts.

57. Within the scope of the S80 Release changes were introduced that moved office
accounting away from weekly Cash Account production to Trading Periods and
also introduced an automated process to manage Unclaimed Payments and
Uncharged Receipts that existed as the office level Suspense Account. Up until
the S80 Release errors made by office in transacting business had been dealt
with through a paper process that required office managers to post details (enter
details) of the Error Notices into the Suspense Account; $80 introduced an
automated posting process. This improvement meant that the risk of office errors
relating to amounts manually posted to Suspense Accounts was mitigated and
the overall time taken for error notice processing was reduced.

58. The introduction of Trading Periods in offices did not change the concept of
producing a formal statement of activity within an agreed time period however it
was a new process to be followed.

59.In terms of engagement with end users in any business function impacted by the
IMPACT Programme | am unable to list and specify the details of engagement
however the role of the change manager, and the change management
functional representatives, was to ensure that end users were engaged and
supporting management staff were engaged in the design and testing of the
changes. The Programme, and POL management recognised, that user input
was an important element of ensuring a good user interface and user experience.

60. Whilst | am unable to reference specific notes, or documents, | can confirm that
user feedback was important to the IMPACT Programme team and that feedback

would have been taken on board and acted upon where appropriate. The

Page 23 of 32
6

WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

feedback would have included comment on User Interface such as screen
workflow, colours, positioning on screen, understanding of language used in
instructions. There would also have been feedback gleaned from users
interacting with the testing team with the aim of reducing the risk of errors. Whilst
| cannot provide any specific example | am sure that not all user feedback was
accepted; for example if a user disagreed with a fundamental aspect of the
concept, the business design, | believe that the overall business benefit to POL

would have been the over-riding necessity.

. General

Reflecting on the testing, trial, and formal acceptance of the Horizon system | can
say that a significant amount of effort was put in by staff in the BA/POCL
Programme, staff in POCL regions, and office staff to support testing and trials.
The development phase of the programme spanned years and this reflected the
complexity of the scope of work as well as changes of sponsorship structure
when the Benefits Agency withdrew. The formal acceptance of Horizon was also
an extensive process with input from many Programme subject matter experts. |
have reflected on the question of the effectiveness of the assurance and scrutiny
that was undertaken in the Programme and, obviously, in light of the flaws that
have been exposed in the Horizon System it was not sufficient. Being involved in
the Programme from the Request for Proposal (RfP) stage through to
implementation | worked with many capable people who were fully committed to

delivering a robust system and, whilst not ignorant of the cost impacts of the time

Page 24 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

taken, were not discouraged from raising challenges where issues were

identified.

62. During the Horizon Programme processes were executed across workstreams to
capture and manage issues as they arose. | believe that there was recognition
across the Programme that issue management was an important process and |
have no sense that there was any conscious effort to hide issues. In a complex
programme many issues will arise and, whilst there was, in my opinion, a robust
process for issues management | now question whether there was a focus on
managing the many individual issues at the expense of some level of deeper
analysis of root cause and potential relationship between issues.

63. At the point that formal Acceptance was discussed between POCL and ICL
Pathway in 1999 there pressure was being applied by ICL Pathway management
to close all the outstanding Incidents. From my involvement in the Acceptance
Process | always felt confident that the POCL acceptance managers were
prepared to move to acceptance only if the Acceptance Incidents had been
closed, or had plans to close, in an appropriate and acceptable way, a way that
did not represent risk to POCL as a business or to users of the system. On
reflection, looking back to the 9 Acceptance Incidents that were the focus of
attention in Summer 1999 it seems that perhaps we did not fully understand the
critical issues.

64. In terms of interaction with key stakeholders who would use or be directly
impacted by the introduction of the Horizon System there was extensive

interaction. ICL Pathway also recruited at least one sub postmaster to support

Page 25 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

their understanding of user needs. Input and ongoing engagement was
undertaken with all POCL business functions, and whilst they were involved in
the BA/ POCL Programme, the Benefits Agency. National Federation of
Subpostmasters (NFSP), Communication Managers Association, Communication
Workers Union were also involved as key stakeholders with regular interaction.
There was great support for the concept that the BA/POCL Programme
represented.

65. Changes were made to the Horizon System for various reasons; for example to
fix identified defects, to implement deferred fixes, to introduce new products, to
deliver POCL / POL strategic imperatives such as new capabilities or business
efficiencies. In the Horizon Programme there was significant engagement with,
and feedback from, end users. The IMPACT Programme also had engagement
and interaction with end users. | believe that business as usual fixes would have
involved less end user participation (but would still go through rigorous testing).

66. On reflection it appears that (perhaps) there was a weakness in the depth and
breadth of the analysis of incidents that end users were reporting to the HSHD.
POL Audit were also identifying apparent office discrepancies but it is unclear to
me whether there was any trend data that might have suggested unusual
patterns associated with the increased number of such discrepancies post the
implementation of the Horizon System or post any Horizon Release. From a
different perspective POCL / POL regional operational management would have
had long term relationships with subpostmasters and some of the discrepancies

would, | expect, have caused questions to be raised about legitimacy. In

Page 26 of 32
WITNO03920100
WITNO03920100

summary, | feel that there should have been threads of data / information that
might have resulted in earlier identification of fundamental issues but such
threads were not, to my knowledge recognised or brought together.

67. The scope of the Horizon Programme was significant and at the time of the
contract award it was suggested to be the largest infrastructure project in Europe
outside of military initiatives. In terms of reflection on the original scope it was
clear at the time that the Benefits Agency and POCL had differing strategic aims;
for POCL the delivery of an integrated point of sale system that secured benefits
encashment business through BES functionality was the desired outcome; it
seemed that the Benefits Agency had a desired strategic outcome that moved
benefit payment to direct credit transfer to recipients bank accounts. For a
Programme of this scale, with 2 different sponsoring organisations (BA and
POCL), it seemed unfortunate desired strategic outcomes of the sponsors were
incompatible.

68. In terms of the sourcing process the sponsor is seeking the optimum outcome
from a commercial and technical perspective in the appointment of a partner /
supplier, In the sourcing process it was not clear to me how the financial
evaluation weighting was given such priority over the technical evaluation as to
lead to the contract being offered to ICL Pathway. | acknowledge that there has
to be a balance between commercial and technical evaluation outcomes and
ultimately, perhaps, the appointment of a different partner may have led to the

same outcome.

69.

WITNO03920100

In terms of the Horizon Programme and reflecting on the scope and risk involved,
and the number of years effort invested in the change, | now wonder whether the
tisk analysis associated with the ICL Pathway approach to development and
implementation might have driven a different approach. | have no doubt that
POCL management at the time considered the risks associated with the
proposed development and implementation path however one possibility would
have been to find a way to decompose the scope of the Programme into smaller

projects that might have carried less risk.

70. In preparing this statement | feel that | am actually no wiser in understanding the

root causes of the system instability or lack of data integrity. It seems likely that
there were multiple causes and it is important to try and understand the detail to
help avoid such outcomes in the future. The adverse impacts on people who
used and trusted the Horizon System are shocking and something for which | am
deeply sorry. Nobody in the Horizon Programme, or the IMPACT Programme,
had any intention of designing or implementing a system that had fundamental

flaws.
