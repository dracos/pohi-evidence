Subject: notes from meeting with Second Sight
All

Quick note from today’s meeting with second sight.

1. The number 1 issue is documentation, or lack of it. They are becoming increasing frustrated. Hopefully,
things should start to get better as Angela has kindly nominated someone in her team to help us, and with
Jarnail back next week we should be able to get our hands on the prosecution files

2. They requested a training session on Horizon similar to the session Chris Davill and co went on a few months
ago.

3. lan Henderson and I are going to Fujitsu next Thursday to start the conversation around Horizon and data
extraction.

4. Second Sight have expressed an interest in viewing, at a distance, how we approach a couple live cases. They
are forming a view that we are a poor at investigations but before they put it into their report would like to
see how we now approach investigations now as they believe we may have improved.

Angela, do I talk to Craig on points 2 and 4?

Regards, Simon
