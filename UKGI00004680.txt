Dear Laura

Please find attached a couple of FOI responses on prosecutions. The first gives numbers for prosecutions and
convictions for the years 2009 to 2013/14 (with caveats). Unfortunately we are unable to go further back (see Mel’s
note below).

Do shout if you need anything further.

Best wishes

Subject: FOI responses on prosecutions

Jane — these are the two FOI responses to the BBC — one from last October providing figures for past five years and
one more recent one which gives the 14/15 figure of one prosecution and the context for the drop in the numbers,
which is essentially that we behaved appropriately, there was an investigation into Horizon etc.

It would, as discussed, be very difficult to go back many years ago because the information was held differently and
under the central RM legal function (it may not now even exist under retention policies). I think we have had to refuse
some FOls for older information in the past on a cost or other basis because of the difficulties.
