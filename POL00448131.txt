Monthly Accounting:

Settling discrepancies

When you complete a monthly trading period balance, any
branch discrepancies for that trading period will need to be
accounted for so that you can start the new trading period
afresh, with zero discrepancies.

Depending on your branch type, before rolling over into
the new trading period, you will have at least one of the
following three options available on the Horizon screen:

1. Review Dispute CALL BSC

You can select this option for all discrepancies. The
discrepancy amount will move into a centralised holding
account at the end of the trading period, awaiting dispute,
further investigation, a Transaction Correction or payment
to Post Office.

If you choose ‘Review Dispute CALL BSC; it's really
important that you call the Branch Support Centre as soon
as possible. They'll ask you to provide information, so they
can support you to understand and resolve the discrepancy
sooner.

2. Make good cash

This is optional if you would like to settle the discrepancy
without disputing it. You can select this option, then
physically add or remove cash to balance without a
discrepancy.

3. Assign to nominee

If you work in a strategic partner branch, for example,
where a Post Office branch is based within a store chain
such as McColl’s or Co-op, then this is the only option for
settling discrepancies for any amount.

This option acts in the same way as ‘Review or Dispute’
does for other branch types.

How to dispute a discrepancy

Strategic Partner branches: If you are unable to
resolve any discrepancies, please contact your Partner
Relationship Manager in the first instance.

All other branches: Whichever option you use to settle a
discrepancy at the end of the trading period, you can still
dispute the discrepancy with Post Office. To do this contact
the Branch Support Centre.

If you can demonstrate the reason for the discrepancy or if
you firmly believe the discrepancy will be resolved through
a Transaction Correction, please call the Branch Support
Centre with all the details you have.

Guidance on disputing a discrepancy
or Transaction Correction

Making that initial call into the Branch Support Centre

Once you make an initial call into the Branch Support Centre, they will support you through your balancing
issue. They will need vital contact information such as an email address and telephone numbers from you to
help them keep you updated about progress. If required, they will ask about your discrepancy and perform
some basic checks over the phone to try to resolve the issue there and then.

if they are unable to resolve your issue right away, they will pass it to the investigations team.

When it gets passed to the investigations team

An investigations advisor will notify you by telephone and/or email to let you know they are working on your
case, and they might request further information about it.

They will then triage your case and let you know how long it might take to resolve. If they cannot resolve
your case within the target timeline, they will call to apologise and update you on progress.

What happens at the end of the investigation?

The investigations advisor will let you know the outcome of your discrepancy and offer you a report of the
findings to help explain what has been done.

If a discrepancy amount has been investigated by Post Office, or agreed by the Postmaster, and is found to
be a genuine loss to Post Office, the discrepancy will be passed to the Postmaster Account Support Team to
support you through the options regarding settling the amount.

If the investigation cannot find a genuine loss to the Post Office, a decision about clearing the discrepancy will be
taken and any gains to the Post Office will be paid back to you, and the Postmaster Account Support Team will
advise about the steps.

Whatever the outcome, they will support you through what this means in terms of branch accounting
operations and your options regarding the outcome of the investigation.

What if you don’t agree with the outcome of the investigation?

If you disagree with the outcome of an investigation, you can request that your case is reviewed by the
Review Committee for compliance with Post Office policies and procedures, and if further evidence is
provided to support your reasons for dispute, that further investigation is undertaken.
