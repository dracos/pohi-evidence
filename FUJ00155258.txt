Subject: RE: Peak 152376: CAPS Process Locking the messagestore PC0164429

Hi,

I have already prepared and done initial module testing for this PEAK. Because of this I can foresee no problems
at all with this fix. I will zip the source up and attach it to the PEAK for audit purposes. I am on leave for just over two
weeks after today and so will not be able personally to finish things until I get back - I hope this is not a problem. Since it
is a live fix I would be inclined to spend a further two days on this for source administration, to do further code inspection
and module testing. According to our development processes we should then have an independent review of my source
changes and test plan.

What release stream shall I propose the fix for?

Regards,
Gerald Barnes

Didn't have the option to reopen call so have simply taken a clone. Call PC0164429 is therefore now with Gerald.

Gerald,

Can you liaise with Dave Seddon / Lionel to get this re-opened and then back to RMF?
Thanks

Steve

Roy,

As requested yesterday, I've had a look at the relevant code and a chat with Gerald and I'm satisfied that the fix that
Gerald has proposed for this peak is low risk and should remove this particular cause of timeouts.

The actual Peak is now closed, so I’m not sure exactly what process should be followed, but effectively what I think we
need is for the peak to be re-opened and sent to RMF for further consideration in light of recent investigations.

Are you and Steve able to progress it from here?
Regards
Gareth
