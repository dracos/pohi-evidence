That would be fine and please use the
Eye, do let James know it was not me. As per the agreement I am not talking to the press,
well at present anyway.

Not 4:30 for an hour - I'd have thought 12:30 for half an hour would be enough.

James,

Alan wonders whether this might take place on Thursday? Might we fit him in either at:

8.30am for an hour
12.30 for half an hour
4.30 for an hour

This is to discuss email you sent him yesterday...

Interim report

How to handle report’s release — communication to Sub PostMasters and Mistresses, to
media

Idea of Post Office handling further investigations in-house via Company Secretary

Let me know,
Janet
