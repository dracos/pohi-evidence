Dear Mr Hine,

Post Office Horizon System
Thank you for your letter of 22 June 2012 regarding this matter.

l appreciate your interest, and am pleased that you have made contact with me. I must,
however, disappoint you. My belief as well as that of the MPs who have joined me in
meetings about this matter, are convinced that whoever takes on the investigations into
each case must be genuinely independent. The Post Office is insisting on this as well,
therefore we have decided that anyone with prior connection to the cases involved really
cannot take part. This, alas, rules you out, and I am sorry to have to let you know this.

As I have mentioned in my email to your colleague, Paul Burchett, my colleagues and I are
meeting with representatives from 2" Sight in a week or so. We will use this opportunity to
ascertain their qualifications and objectivity, and if we are unsatisfied, we will not hesitate
to seek other investigators.

We are all very keen to see these cases resolved, each and every one, and there is no
mileage to be gained by appointing anyone who can later be accused of bias. This would
harm our constituents, who remain our focus throughout.

Tam sorry to write in these terms to you, and hope you will understand the reason behind
this decision. I wish you and your business well, and thank you once again for taking the
time to write.

Yours sincerely,
