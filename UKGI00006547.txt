I mentioned to Howard. As I was doing so, Paula ambushed us.
Let's discuss.

Justin / Mark

Worth Mark sighting Howard on this.

I have called lain King (G5 in Finance) to get a picture slightly higher up the chain. He said that if we withhold
payment of the £220m for good reason (i.e. better budget process in future, a more challenging budget etc) then
Howard tends to be relaxed (even though BIS will be fined).

We should therefore approve payment on the 14" March in anticipation of paying it on 1° April, but providing we are
justified in doing so we could withhold it. We therefore have a bit more flexibility, but it would be worth Mark just
raising this prospect with Howard so that we all go in with our eyes open.

Mark - one data point for you. Richard has been looking at the timing for the payment to POL (£220mm for 2016/17).
The last day for us to sign off the BIS process is 14 March.

Apparently, delaying beyond that causes some difficult issues for government finances (Richard can clarify exactly
how). March 14 is one week before the board approve the budget and the same day the board papers with the budget
go out. We will have one working day after the POL executive sign off (March 10) to approve it ourselves and set in
train the BIS process.

We are preparing a detailed timetable for next years process to avoid bottlenecks and mismatches of timings but for
this year we will have to work with the timing that POL have imposed.

Yes is the answer and this is in hand.
Best for us to have 10 mins on this.

Do we need to look a bit more closely at POL given the amount of money they are spending overall in transformation
and now this ? And given we underwrite them ? Do they have the skills needed to modernise . Horizon was a

problem when I was at DWP over 7 years ago and is the spine of their business model.
