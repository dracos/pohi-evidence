New Actions and points to note from combined meeting of 21/01/10 - ACCEPTANCE
AG3.60 I Decision I Acceptance position.

DC confirmed that there are no outstanding

High Severity Acceptance Incidents, and that all

other thresholds are within tolerance for

Acceptance Gateway 3.

Discussion ensued over the relevance to formal

acceptance of the outstanding assurances for

Service Delivery. It was agreed that these are

more relevant to the ongoing release

authorisation decisions, and therefore do not

preclude passing through AG3.

However it was agreed that the high priority

fixes in “Reset 4” — to be delivered as part of

Maintenance Release 01.08 — could constitute

a High Severity Al if not delivered in time for the

High Volume Pilot (over 272 branches).

As such, “Qualified Acceptance” at AG3 was

agreed, subject to the successful delivery of the

high priority items in Reset 04 (see

AG3.61below for assessment of “high priority”

items).

Whilst not an exact match, this is closest to

Acceptance Board Recommendation 3:

“Proceed at risk through Acceptance

Gateway’.

Info

Draft schedule for Medium Volume
pilot. Discussions have been ongoing
over the optimal timing and volume of
branches to migrate each day during the
Medium Volume pilot.

It has been agreed to target Thursday
28" January for the first 10 branches,
with the remaining schedule under
discussion, but expected to be along the
following lines:-

o Thursday 28/01 — 10 branches.
This is expected to allow the critical
fixes for the implementation issues to
be fixed (see AG3.64 below)

o Friday 29/01 to Sunday 31/01 — No
further branches

Then, dependent on success of the first

10;

o Mon 01 Feb — 20 branches

Tue 02 Feb - 50

Wed 03 Feb - 70

Thur 04 Feb - 100

Fri 05 Feb — 10 plus retries.

This was different to the profile
understood by Fujitsu, but was agreed in
the meeting as feasible. Further
discussions will continue to fine tune and
agree branches.

AG3.64 Info I Issues raised in pilot : assessment of
risk and required timescales for fix

A number of POL-impacting issues have
occurred during the pilot, mostly during
the implementation process itself. To
ease the migration process, many of
these need to be fixed before any
further migrations can take place — while
others are more manageable.

These were therefore assessed in turn
for their “required by” dates using the
above migration profile.

This position is summarised in the table

DECISION. Decision

Based on the balance of the above
items, it was agreed that — subject to
progress against AG3.64, AG3.66 and
AG3.67 — the pilot should extend to the
next 10 branches on 28" January.

A checkpoint meeting will be held on 27"
January to confirm that sufficient
progress has been made to go to the 10.

A further checkpoint will be held on 1*

has been made to continue pilot at the

Double settlement at Derby. In
addition to the above, there have been 2

Decision - Postponement of next 10

impact and way forward is fully
understood. A checkpoint will be held at
10:30 on Friday 29" Jan, with follow-up
