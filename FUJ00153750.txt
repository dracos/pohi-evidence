You are aware that we have or had a banking indemnity in place that would mean, if I recall it properly, that if the
outcome of the investigation were adverse that Fujitsu might have some liability to POL....

Also how about Clause 16 and

Clause 16.3 - Fujitsu Services shall offer all reasonable assistance to Post Office in preventing
fraudulent use of the Services, the HNG-X Development, the Associated Change Development, the Horizon
Service Infrastructure and the PostShop Infrastructure by Post Office's employees and Agents.

Surely this means that we cant refuse their request in any event...

Hi David,

The suggestion (I understand it has not been officially requested) has come directly from Mike Young (the highest
level of engagement).

We are of course aware of the contractual obligations and, as this does not form part of them, the team would be
more interested in any other considerations.

Kind regards

Hi — have you looked at the contract and our security service obligations? I expect there will be some co-operation
obligations...

Who is making the request from POL and is it at the right level of engagement?

Best wishes

Hi David,

Further to Penny’s email below, we have been informed that POL are making noises about commissioning an
independent evaluation of the Horizon system with a view, presumably, to putting all integrity issues to bed once and
for all.

The team is not at all inclined to accept this request (especially bearing in mind that the system is now defunct) but
they have sought official guidance on how they should deal with the request. Given the link with on-going/potential
litigation, are there any particular issues you would be concerned about and would like to raise at this stage?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Kind regards

JP

All

There was an interesting article featured on the local radio station, BBC Surrey, this morning and I listened while
travelling to work.

Misra, a convicted sub-postmistress, now pregnant and serving a jail sentence in Bronsville Prison for theft and false
accounting from the West Byfleet Post Office and 55 other sub-postmasters/mistresses are planning to take civil
action against the Post Office because of the flawed accounting system used at the Post Office outlets. There are to
be 6 test cases, South Warnborough was identified as one.

There was an emotional interview with Davinda Misra (the husband) who stated that the system was losing money
right from the very beginning, they couldn’t find the problem, and neither could the auditor who was sent from the Post
Office.

A spokesperson from the Post Office stated that the Horizon system was ‘absolutely accurate and reliable at all times’.
Robust testing procedures had been undertaken.

Jonathan Lord, MP for Woking is concerned and will ensure a full financial investigation, absolutely independent, is
carried out. He stated that the processes which Post Office employed where discrepancies arose should be fair, and
conducted in a prompt and proper way; these Post Office procedures are to be looked at closely.

The story is being featured on the BBC’s Inside Out programme tonight.
