Hi Matthew, I'm in the process of putting together the charges for Gareth Jenkins for the Expert Litigation Support he
provides. Could you please advise what you charge as an hourly rate?
this is to cover February activities
Church Matthew [12:36]:
his daily rate is £1,199 divded by 7.4hrs to get the hrly rate of £162.02
can you used these numbers when you get the amounts agreed with the customer, so they agree the values as well
as the hrs
thanks
also there is going to be a RPI change applied in FY13/14 of 3.1%
but the change note has not been signed yet so we cannot apply until the change note is signed
Thomas Penny [12:39]:
ok, | will not include the additional charge at this point, but once agreed you will need to let Raj Bains or Andy Dunks
know this needs including. Hopefully they will follow the sam format as me and send to you before they send to
POL! I'll mention that to them
