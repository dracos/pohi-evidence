1.0 Introduction

1.2

Purpose

This Access Control Policy (ACP) defines the policy for controlling access to resources in
the Horizon system.

Effective control depends on:

‘* Understanding the information in the system and what access to it should be permitted,
and where it is vulnerable;

© Having a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of all personnel who need some
form of access to the system;

© Setting access policies and controls to provide the required access while countering the
threats and vulnerabilities.

During the Migration period there will be another ACP available SVM/SDM/POL/0027
which has been specifically written for the HNGX system, this will ultimately replace
the current Horizon document when the Horizon system is switched off.

Context

Information Security is based on a number of precepts, the most important of which are
defined as being; confidentiality, integrity and availability,

These are broad categories of security controls which can be employed to provide various
levels of security to guard against specific or perceived ‘risks’ which have been jointly
identified by Post Office and Fujitsu. This document_defines the policies for controlling
access to the Post Office Account IT system in compliance with the Post Office Account
Security Policy and -fits into the structure of documents for Post Office Accounts security as
illustrated in figure 1-1 below::

Controlling access to IT resources requires a combination of physical controls and manual
procedures as well as technical controls oin the IT system._ Other documents define the
related policies, procedures and processes, for example, for the physical security of
information,_-(including the procedures for entering a site and the safeguarding manual
records, as well as procedures for using the system and the handling security incidents.
Other documents define how the various Post Office Account components are configured
and integrated into the system.

Effect on other Post Office Account Standards and Procedures

This Access Control Policy defines the policy for controlling both human and non human
access to resources in the operational Horizon s s explained in section 1.2; other
documents give more details of the technical solution and the associated policies and
procedures. The effect of the Access Control Policy on these other documents is:

Configuration documents should define in detail how systems are configured to conform
to the ACP, for example, how the roles defined in the ACP are set up to restrict access as
required.

The roles defined in the ACP should be used in other standards and procedures, not just
information system controls. For example:

© where a role requires access to administrative privileges or sensitive data, this should
be reflected in the level of vetting required for staff in that role;

© users in these roles must be formally registered and authorised to take that role by
the appropriate authority before being added to the IT system. Records of all
persons registered to use the system must be kept, though the way this is done may
be role or service dependent.

Where physical security and/or procedures are required to complement the IT controls to
provide-achieve the required level of access controls, such procedures need to conform
to the ACP.

The Post Office Account Security Manager will satisfy himself that the procedures at the
various Outlets are in compliance with the Post Office Account security policies and
specifications.

Scope and Document Structure

This Access Control Policy defines how access to information system resources is controlled
in the Post Office Account solution. It covers the Post Office Account Data Centre systems;
Post Office Account managed systems such as interface systems at Post Office Ltd. Outlets
and closely related Post Office Account project-systems. Access may be the result of direct
user action, or automatically initiated activities.

This document specifies access control policies, not the detailed procedures for configuring

and running operating these systems.

Separate internal Post Office Account documents also cover system development and test

systems and other activities prior to the handing over of the software for operational use.

Access Control Policy Review

This document will be formally reviewed at least annually. It will also be reviewed, where
necessary, relevant-after a significant security incident, as part of an update following
enhancements or new services being introduced, or a more general security policy review,
and updated whenever-as_and when necessary_if there has been a significant securit
incident,

Responsibilities for the approval, review and issue of this document will conform to the
review procedure for Post Office Account policy and standards defined in the Post Office
Account Security Policy.

Services, Systems and Interactions

Information is sent from Post Office Ltd. (reference data) and Post Office Lid. clients (APS
information from Post Office Ltd. clients) to the Post Office Account Data Centres. Most of
this data is also forwarded to relevant Post Office outlets for use by applications there.
Transactions at the Post Office outlets are recorded at the correspondence servers and
forwarded to Post Office Ltd. and/or other Post Office Lid. clients as relevant. NBS on-line
transaction data is exchanged with the NBENBX via dedicated NB-Authorisation Agents
over an encrypted link.

At the Data Centres the main applications are on Sequent/UNEXSolaris systems but the
agents and correspondence servers which handle distribution of information to and from the
Post Office outlets are on NEMicrosoft servers, as are most of the supporting systems such
as the key management systems. Post Office Systems are also NFMicrosoft platforms:

Apart from at the Post Office outlets, all activities are automated in normal circumstances,
so there are no business users.
Roles

At the Post Office counters, operational roles are the Post Office Manager, Supervisor and
Counter Clerk. There are equivalent roles in franchises and Sub Post Office outlets ie. Sub
Postmasters and their staff.

Services and Systems

The OCMS database contains information about Post Office outlets where Horizon is to be
implemented or withdrawn, for example, Post Office details, the state of the site etc.

Configuration information comes mainly from the auto-configuration system and is used in
the initial set-up or in respect of decommissioning activities of Post Office outlets, updating
the generic set-up of the counter systems as delivered. The auto-configuration process is
very largely automated,

2.4.1 Services and Interactions

System and operational management and support users manage and support Post Office
outlets, systems at the Data Centre (including routers and firewalls) and Post Office Account

managed systems such as the interface PCs at Post Office Ltd.

The help desk handles all technical calls from Post Office Ltd. and other Post Office
Account users including those from the Post Office requiring key and password recovery

services.

Post Office Account project sites include a Configuration Management system that enables
software to be distributed to the Horizon systems, including Post Office outlets. There are

also test rigs used by application support staff for detecting and fixing bugs.

The technical help desk and system/operational management and support staff also use
internal Post Office Account/Fujitsu Services support tools such as the Powerhelp and
Problem Management systems for recording, progressing and monitoring calls to the help

desk.

2.4.2 Roles

The main roles are as follows:

2.5

Operational Management (sometimes called System Administration): keeping the
system running where this is not carried out by system management. Operational
management is normally split into sub-roles, including:

— System set-up and installation: setting up the base and application software on the
system and configuring it for live running, including roles.

— Software update, where this is not automated via system management.

—  Security/User administration: administering user security information such as their
authentication information, the roles they can perform and the groups to which they
belong.

— Database (e.g. Oracle) or Package (e.g. Riposte) administration.

— Computer operator: on most systems, this is a minimal role - switching on machines,
loading media and similar operations.

— Other system administration functions.

Note that some package administration is done by people supporting the application
users e.g. Discoverer and Business Objects are administered by corporate
management support staff.

System Management: monitoring events and resources in the operational system and
taking appropriate action to rectify problems. Also, distributing software (complete new
packages or patches), where this is automated, for example, at the Post Office outlets.
Sub-roles for operational management separate specific roles and also. separate
administration of users and the Tivoli system itself.

Network Management: managing the network, including routers and firewalls, which
connect machines and Outlets.

Application support; 2nd, 3rd and 4th line.
Other hardware and system support.
Horizon System and other technical help desks and supporting staff.

Engineers.

Post Office Account Sites and Interactions

The main Horizon services run at the secure Post Office Account Data Centres. This
includes primary operational systems, most corporate management systems, some Outlet
Business Change and system & network management systems as outlined in previous
sections.

Figure 2.5 Post Office Account Data Centres and linked Outlets

All links to the Data Centres are protected by routers, firewalls and DMZs, cryptographic
boxes or VPN (or a combination of these) depending on the requirements protecting each
type of link and the data that travels over it. Routers and firewalls are also used to separate
Data Centre systems in some cases.

Where Post Office Account communicates with other organisation’s sites (such as Post
Office Ltd.), Post Office Account will manages the interface PC/router at that site to provide
a gateway between Post Office Account and that organisation’s systems, however, this
differs in a number of cases for services such as NBX for LINK and CAPO, Streamline, and
The main Post Office Account project sites that have access to the Data Centre systems have
secure LANs for that access with an encrypted link to the Data Centre. Where people at
these sites access other systems, including other sites, there are separate networks. At some
Post Office Account project sites there are more complex networks which permit limited
traffic to/from other controlled systems (e.g. for software distribution from the
Configuration Management systems and for downloading of data to test rigs for
investigating faults). In these cases, firewalls are used at the project sites to control this
traffic.

There are a number of other support and Outlet Business Change sites with different types
of access. These are subject to different access control policies as appropriate for the site.

Overall Access Control Policies

This chapterSection identifies the overall access control policies and associated procedures
and controls that apply across the Horizon solution. It outlines the general policies that apply
across systems and identifies where variants and exceptions are permitted. In these cases,
the exceptions are defined in the appropriate sub-section of ehapterSections 4 and 5 below.
No other variants are permitted.

Introduction

The objectives in the Post Office Account Security Policy give the requirements for
confidentiality and integrity of data, whether in storage or in transit, and integrity of the
services and software components. The ACP defines the policies for controlling access in
line with these objectives.

Post Office Account Human Roles

Human access to the Post Office Account information systems is specified in terms of roles.
People in specified roles are permitted to carry out defined functions and access specified
data. This is normally monitored by controls within the information systems, though in some
cases, manual procedures are used to supplement these.

Post Office Account controls the roles people are allowed to perform, and which functions
they are allowed to carry out. Users are individually identified so that they can be made
accountable for their actions.

Where practical, the same or similar roles are defined for several systems to reduce
complexity and make it easier to check compliance with the overall security policy.

The Access Control Policy includes all roles for users who have direct access to the Horizon
operational systems and the related systems at the Data Centres. In addition, this document
includes a limited number of user roles that enable others to use the system on their behalf
(e.g. in response to a phone call).

Roles are normally associated with major functions. Defining separate roles allows different
functions to be allocated to different individuals. However, the actual allocation of roles to
individuals is done by administrative action, Some users may be permitted to carry out more
than one major function, so are permitted to take more than one “role”. This is not
permitted in cases where security may be undermined.

Types of Information and its Use

Information in the Horizon system that requires protection from unauthorised access
includes:

© The business data exchanged with Post Office Ltd. and its clients (e.g. reference data to
support EPOSS and transaction data resulting from Post Office counter activities.)
Business data is transferred between Post Office Ltd., Post Office Ltd. Clients and the
Post Office Account Data Centres and between the Data Centres and the Post Office
outlets. It is stored at the main operation systems and also in archives. Some data is also
available for management services at-the Data Warehouse -and-accessed-via the SMDB.

* Post Office Account business management data - financials, service level agreements
etc. Confidentiality and integrity requirements exist for much of this data. The
Management Information System collects this data from the operational systems. This is
then forwarded as appropriate to Post Office Account sites, Post Office Ltd. and their
Clients.

© Other data supporting the business processes such as training data (special, non-
sensitive, business style data used in training sessions) and on-line documentation (e.g.
Post Office procedures.)

‘© Operational systems data such as the software, configuration information, Tivoli scripts,
system management event logs etc. This information is held mainly at the Data Centre
and accessed remotely from system management and support sites.

© Security information about users, keys, security audit logs etc.

Most processing of the business information, except at the Post Office Outlet, is automated
and therefore not subject to human access. Most processing of system data is also
automated.

All information is protected in compliance with the Security Functional Specification and
Post Office Account Security Policy.
General Principles

The following general principles should be followed in controlling access to the Horizon
systems.

The principle of “least privilege” must apply to restrict the access rights of users. (This
may be applied through a mixture of technical and procedural controls.)

Duties of different users should be separated to minimise the damage that any one user
can do to the system or the information it contains.

Ifa role at a particular location is allocated to a single person there should generally be
at least one other person who can deputise for that person. (At small Post Office outlets
where no deputy is available, and the Post Office Manager is unavailable, the Post
Office Outlet will not open until emergency procedures have been invoked.)

Where possible, Post Office Account operations are automated to reduce the need for
human intervention and the potential accidental and malicious security breaches that
could result from human activity. E.g. applications should be designed to reduce the
dependence on human interaction and jobs should be scheduled automatically in
response to the receipt of files or at a particular time.

Similarly, where practical, system management tasks should be automated. This
includes taking remedial action where the results of monitoring the system show this is
needed. Only where action cannot be taken automatically, or human verification of an
action is needed, should human intervention be required.

Note: Téhat-this document covers access by system entities as well as human users, but does
not define roles for them.
Human Access

This section contains the policies for how human access to the Horizon systems is
controlled. It is divided into sub-section for policies on:

‘* Authentication to prove the user’s identity to the IT system, and hence the user’s right to
take on a particular role and access particular resources.

‘© User registration’ administration to establish and maintain the user’s identity and
security attributes (i.e. role, password, etc).

Authentication of visitors.
Authentication by telephone.

Control of human access to resources (see also 3.5),
Authentication to IT Systems

All users must be authenticated to IT systems. This authentication must identify them as
individuals. (The few permitted exceptions to this policy are in ChapterSection 4).

People accessing Horizon systems are required to identify themselves using hand held
tokens if:

© They are at sites remote from the Data Centre and can update operational or MIS
systems (for example, to perform systems management actions).

* They can access Post Office Ltd. business data (except at Post Office outlets).

They are authorised to update system data that can affect the running of the Horizon
systems. This includes roles that have UNIX root privilege, NT users belonging to
the administrator’s group and database administrators.

Where such tokens are used for authentication, the associated PIN must be at least 6
characters long.

Each user must have an individually allocated token except in emergencies, e.g. when a
token is lost. In such cases, specific authentication will be agreed.

Where a user needs to authenticate to multiple systems/domains in one session, the first
authentication (normally to the local workstation) should be with a token.

If a user who authenticates with a token to one system/domain needs to perform an
additional authentication to another system/domain, the second authentication should
also be a token based one, using the same token, Agreed exceptions to this must be
documented.

3.3.1.7 Where passwords are used for authentication, the user should be forced to change the
initial password before any other access to the system is permitted.

3.3.1.8 Passwords must expire in 30 days unless otherwise stated (in the section on the
appropriate domain).

3.3.1.9 Re-use of the same password is not permitted for either a specified time or until at least

3-12 other passwords have been used.

3.3.1.10 _Passwords must be a minimum of 6 characters long and be alphanumeric (i.e. a mix of
letters and numbers). There cannot be more than two consecutive identical characters.
The password cannot be the same as the username.

Note: The minimum password length recommended by industry best practice is 9 characters and
should consist of upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and symbols. All new systems
should conform to this recommendation, however, it is recognised that some legacy systems will
only be able to meet the requirements at 3.3.1.10 above,

3-3:4403.3.1.11 Afier 3 consecutive unsuccessful attempts to log-on, the user should be
locked out unless otherwise stated.

3.3.1.12 _ Users are authenticated with their individual usernames on first access to the system. A
change to use another username will only be permitted to certain authorised operational
management roles in exceptional circumstances as specified in this document,_e.¢-for

Any change to use another username must be controlled and audited in a way that is
always recorded.

3:34:413.3.1.13 In limited circumstances an operational management role may need full

system adminis ible, the user should be given
limited privileges on log-on with additional privileges being subject to further
authorisation, In particular, no user will be allowed to log onto UNIX with root access
(though some may be permitted a controlled change to root access later).

3.3.2. User Registration and Administration

3.3.2.1 People must be identified to Post Office Account information system as individuals.
Users with direct access to the system should be registered as follows:

© Ifaccessing the system via a package such as Oracle or Tivoli, they are registered
with that package.

© Users who require direct access to the operating system are registered with that
operating system (at the local system or NFMICROSOFT domain)

© Users requiring token authentication are also registered with the appropriate
authentication service.

Authentication of Visitors to Post Office outlets and Post Office Account
Sites

All visitors to Post Office Account sites who need access to operational systems must
have a company identity card, which includes their photograph and pass number. For all
such visits, the pass number of the visitor must be notified in advance to the relevant
manager; access will not be permitted if this has not been done

Post Office Ltd. Auditors may visit Post Office outlets and other Outlets without prior
notice to the Post Office Manager.

Post Office Account visitors to Post Office Outlets must be subject to Post Office
Account vetting procedures and approval by Post Office Ltd.

Other visitors to Post Office Outlets are also subject to agreed vetting procedures.

Telephone Authentication at Help Desks

The Help Desks receive calls from Customers, Post Office Ltd. staff at Post Office outlets
and other people such as Post Office Account staff. The following categories of call have
different authentication requirements:

© Category 1: Calls where the source of call would not affect the action taken. For
example, the call is just a query of generally available information.

© Category 2: Where the result of the call is to cause an action which has only limited
consequences e.g. to report a problem in the Post Office Outlet (which could result in an
engineer call).

* Category 3: Where the consequences of misidentifying of the caller can be serious and
the telephone authentication is the only authentication of the caller. For example, the
‘wrong person may be allowed access to sensitive information, and/or be able to disrupt
the service.

© Category 4: Where the consequences of the call could potentially be serious, but
authentication of the user on the phone is only part of the process needed to complete an
action. For example, a Post Office Manager has lost the PIN associated with the card
used to boot the system, but will still also require a password to use the system.

For category I calls, no authentication is needed.

For category 2 calls made, for example, by Post Office Ltd. staff, at least the location of
the caller should be verified, for example, the particular Post Office outlet, or Post
Office Ltd. regional centre. This location must be one already known to the Help Desk
for which suitable verification information is available.

For category 3 calls, the caller must be identified individually. (If the person concerned
is not known individually to the Help Desk, the call must be routed via a known centre
for verification. For example, calls from Post Office staff at the Outlet could be routed
via a Post Office Ltd. regional centre whose staff authenticate to the Post Office Account
Help Desk.)

For category 4 calls, the authentication process should at least verify the location of the
call to one known and acceptable for this type of call.

Help Desks must maintain the information required to authenticate the callers and their
Outlets/offices as required for the type of call.

If the call needs to be passed onto another internal Post Office Account help desk, the
call should be forwarded only after the initial authentication has been carried out.

There are several different types of calls in each category. The authentication process for
each call type must conform to these policies.

Details of the information used for different types of call must conform to these policies and
be given in the appropriate Help Desk procedures.

Control of Human Access to Resources

Control of access to resources is achieved partly by workstation set-up and partly by
administration of the resource, e.g. in the form of an access control list. Details of the way
the access controls are implemented in information systems depend on the product used.
They are not defined in this policy document.

All human users with access to Post Office Account Data Centre or Post Office Account
managed systems on other sites must do so using controlled workstations as defined in
3.6.1.

Access controls associated with resources should define the “role” of the user, not the
individual users identity (unless there is an agreed need for individual access). The role
may be represented by a group identity, for example, in products such as Riposte, UNIX,
and Windows NT and Windows 2000, which support groups, not roles directly.

Access controls associated with resources should provide access to the resources as in
the role definitions in ehapterSection 6.

Non Human Users

Much of the operational Horizon system is automated. Some users are therefore system
based, not human users, so there are usernames and passwords for both types of users. In
general, system users should be subject to the controls specified above (e.g. for password
protection). This is because these usernames generally cannot be confined only to human
users and therefore-they can potentially permit access to usernames intended for system
users, However, some differences are permitted.

The username and password used to automate the login may be held in clear if it is only
accessible to authorised operational management staff for that system and the potential
damage from misuse of that username is minimised.

The password may expire less frequently than the 30 days for human users where
suitably obscure passwords are used, e.g. strong passwords consisting of upper case,
lower case characters, numbers and symbols~and the risk of external access to such
accounts is very low.

Information and Resource Access

This Policy is concerned with protecting information contained in, and transmitted between
all Horizon systems. This includes the Data Centres, Post Office Account managed systems
(such as interface systems at Post Office Ltd. and other Outlets), and the systems used to
access Data Centre and managed systems. Information requiring protection includes that
generated during fault investigations/correction and that retained for auditing and fraud
investigation.

Human access to sensitive information should be restricted to those whose role
authorises them to see it.

Information in transit between systems should be encrypted for confidentiality and/or
integrity according to the needs of the particular link as defined in the Security
Functional Specification {S¥S}.

Digital signatures should be used for integrity of business information between the Post
Office Outlets and other services where required. E.g. for signing automated payments at
the Post Office Outlet prior to transmission via Post Office Account to Post Office Ltd.
or Post Office Ltd. Clients. Some Clients may specify other protection such as
encryption.

System data should also be integrity protected when required. F
protect software distributed to the Post Office outlets and elsewhere.

_s-digital signatures

Business information in filestore at the Post Office PCs should be enerypted

Passwords should be stored in encrypted format_and held- separately from application
data and executable code, except for the specific cases listed in Non Human Access
above.

Horizon systems should prevent interference between human user roles, between
applications and between human users and automated applications.

Information should be appropriately separated in filestore, database tables etc. Each data
set should be accessible only to those with a need for that access.

Different applications should run in their own user names or that of the user that calls
them (or at the Post Office Outlet, in the Riposte username impersonating the user).

Access to shared resources such as filestore should be controlled by:

© Access to that filestore being restricted to a specific product which is available only
to authorised users, or

* Access to those resources being restricted to users in specified roles. (Group IDs may
be used to represent roles. Access control lists using these will ensure that only
authorised people can access the resource).

Information in relational databases should be accessible only via authorised client
“applications” (such as Oracle Forms, Discoverer, Business Objects, Tivoli database
interfaces) except where there is a proven need for lower level access, Lower level
access will only be granted for agreed operational management and support functions.

System Management actions by Tivoli should be activated using pre-defined Tivoli tasks
authorised for use by SMC and the Post Office Account configuration management and
software distribution process. This includes collection of diagnostic information from
the Post Office Outlet for application support.

Packages (such as Oracle and Tivoli) and applications above the operating system must
also conform to the Access Control Policy. For example, Oracle should restrict users to
the authorised tables and views. Also, access to the package’s resources should use role
based access controls.

For client-server applications (such as Oracle Forms ones), audit records should be
generated at the server so audit logs do not rely on input from workstations.

Security audit logs must be protected from everyone except those permitted to take
specified Security Event Auditor roles. Unless otherwise specified for a particular
domain (such as the Post Office outlets), the security-auditing role is separate from other
roles at that domain.

All systems, except Post Office counter systems, must provide read access to audit trails
by authorised security auditors.

3.5.2. Key Management

Cryptography is used widely in Post Office Account as described in the Security Functional
Specification {SES}for:

Protecting information on links for confidentiality, integrity and origin authentication in
line with the requirements for that link.

End-to-end integrity and data origin authentication, potentially over multiple links using
digital signatures.

Filestore encryption at the Post Office Outlet.

Protecting keys associated with the production-operation of PINPads and with the keys
that protect customer PINs.

The following general policies apply for protection of keys.
3.5.2.1 CESG approved keys must be protected in line with CESG requirements,

3.5.2.2 Key material (symmetric keys, DSA private keys and DSA entropy) should be held in
clear only when in physically secure environments.

3.5.2.3 Public keys (except for the CA’s public key) should be held in certificates signed by the
Certification Authority.

3.5.2.4 Symmetric keys should only be stored where necessary, and be held securely.

3.5.2.5 Keys (or part keys) held in filestore must be in a separate filestore accessible only to
authorised key custodians via authorised applications.

3.5.2.6 Keys used for protecting data should not be resident in filestore in clear.

3.5.2.7 Keys should be changed periodically according to CESG policy or, where commercial
algorithms are employed, in accordance with industry recognised timescales. Different
periods may apply to Symmetric Keys used for encrypting data, Key Encryption Keys
(KEKs) used to encrypt other keys and Certification Authority keys.

3.5.2.8 New KEKs should not be distributed solely under the protection of existing KEKs.

3.5.2.9 Key material in transit electronically must be encrypted (except for CHAP keys between
the routers within the Post Office Account Data Centre LAN).

Cryptographic keys and Key Encryption Keys are either installed locally at the machine
where they are to be used, or are distributed electronically using an approved protocol
which protects these keys in transi

3.5.2.11 Where a key is delivered in two parts, e.g. a red key and a black key), the parts should
be delivered by different routes.

3.5.2.12 The key (or part key) to be handled manually must be held in a locked safe when not in
use. Access to this must be authorised and recorded in conformance with Post Office
Account procedures.

3..2.13 The creation, handling, transmission and storage of keys must be undertaken in
accordance with ISO9564. Key generation must be undertaken on standalone
workstations or other hardware units within a physically secure environment.

In addition, the following policies also apply to the management of the NBS related keys:
3.5.2.14 Key generation and management must comply with ISO11568 Parts I to 3.
3..2.15 All keys that may directly or indirectly reveal a plain text PIN must be generated,

handled, transcribed and stored in a way which ensures that no one individual has access
to all key parts.

3.6 System Set-up Policies

3.6.1 Workstation Set-up Policies

3.6.1.1 Users with interactive access to Horizon systems should use “controlled, NF
“workstations” as defined in the following policies in this section. All such exceptions to
the “Implementation Guide for NT Platforms” policy must be authorised and
documented in the ACP.

3.6.1.2. Workstations from which operational systems can be updated should have floppy drives
disabled or be fitted with physical locking devices. Booting from CDROM should also
be disabled once a system has been configured.

In all cases, exceptions to this rule must be documented and agreed with Post Office

Account Security Management.

Workstations at the Post Office display sensitive business data (e.g. about payments)
as part of normal operation. All other workstations, which can display sensitive
information, should be in physically secure areas.

3.6.1.4 All systems should have the required roles, groups and other privileges set up on
installation. It should rarely be necessary to update these. “Guest” users must not be
enabled in the installed systems, and where possible, Guest_accounts should not be
included. Other generic users should not be accessible for user logon except in
exceptional circumstances explicitly defined in the appropriate section below.

3.6-1-43.6.1.5 Operating system set-up and services available at that workstation should be
controlled by Post Office Account or shown to conform to Post Office Account
standards

Workstations that have access to sensitive data or can be used to access Horizon systems
(code or data) should be on separate secure LANS linked only into the Post Office
Account secure network. (Site types 1 and 2 and the Data Centres)

The only permitted exceptions are:

© For authorised transfers of software and data from the controlled Post Office
Account LAN at the management site at Feltham to the appropriate Data Centre
system.

© For application support users linking to test rigs. In agreed circumstances, authorised
application support users may access operational data to investigate a problem and
may download that data to the workstation or test rigs

POL00400809
POL00400809

In these site type 3 cases, firewalls between the LAN on the project site and the
encrypted link to the Data Centres must constrain traffic to just that authorised from
identified project systems to the identified Data Centre systems.

All such users should authenticate using a token.

The secure LAN and workstations must be located in a physically secure area restricted
to permitted users. This also applies to any routers, encryption boxes and firewalls
connecting them to the Post Office Account Data Centres.

Where the workstation is remote from the system being accessed, encrypted links should
be used.

There may be exceptions to this policy in the case of FTMS, Streamline and the TESQA
links to Post Office Ltd. Clients, in any such cases the client is made fully aware the
risks taken in using unencrypted links (see also 3.7.2.7 below).

Where a user also needs access to internal Horizon systems (such as the call recording
and management systems and e-mail), the user must use a second workstation linked to
the internal network and system required but not to the Post Office Account Data Centre.
(Site types 2 and 3).

Incident tracking systems using networks outside the Post Office Account secure
controlled area, for example e.g. the Fujitsu Services corporate network, may include
information relating to a particular record of customer data but must not include such
data, unless adequately protected, for example, by encryption.

There may be exceptions to this policy in the case of PEAK and SMBD where data is
stored unencrypted.

Any external users must conform to these policies.

External support users of Horizon systems (such as SequentSolaris and Cisco) should be
permitted access to Post Office Account Data Centre systems only from approved
Outlets/environments and subject to agreed network and other controls (see 4.6.3).

Where, by the nature of the role(s) to be performed, the workstation requires access to
the Diskette or CR-ROM sub-systems, the workstation must be afforded additional
protection through the use of anti-virus software. Where appropriate other controls such
as the use of physical floppy locking devices and BIOS passwords should also be
employed.

3.7 Network Access Policies

Post Office Account controls should be in place to restrict who can access particular services. This
covers all traffic in and out of, as well as within, the Post Office Account Data Centres and
managed systems and also within parts of the Post Office Account management systems. In
addition to the workstation environment controls above, network access policies should be enforced
where appropriate by the use of a combination of access lists at routers, controls at firewalls,
NFMICROSOFT domain controls, platform controls on use of ports and other application controls.

Transfer of data to/from Post Office Account managed systems at other Outlets such as
Post Office Ltd. and Post Office Ltd. Client systems.

Business and system management traffic to/from the Post Office outlets (which is
protected using a VPN to provide authentication and encryption as well as digital
signatures in some cases - see above)

Business and system information between the Data Centres and Post Office Account
management and Outlet Business Change sites

NBS data transferred to/from the Data Centres and the NBENBX.

The Energis ATM network with its closed user group should be used to restrict access to
the main Post Office Ltd. data (TIP and Reference data) to Post Office Account only.

Alll Fujitsu Services Core Services links should use VPN protection (for authentication
and encryption) or in cases where that cannot be justified, CHAP authentication and

All management and support users access the Data Centres (and other managed systems)
from controlled workstation environments as defined in 3.6.3 above.

All Post Office Account Corporate management, system management and support sites
with access to the main operational systems should have fixed links to the Data Centres,

External support users with access to any of the Horizon systems containing sensitive or
protectively marked information must access the systems via controlled workstations
and environments as for Post Office Account support staff, but subject to extra controls
— see appropriate section below. (Support of routers is an exception — see below).

All such fixed links should be protected by the use of hardware encryption devices using
the Rambutan algorithm or where this is not appropriate, by the use of an agreed
commercial algorithm.

Apart from links via the Energis closed user group to the main Post Office Ltd, systems
(and via Post Office Ltd., to Royal Mail), all access to the Data Centre by external
organisations for support or other purposes should be firewalled from the main Data
Centre systems. Any exception to this must be agreed with the Post Office Account
Security Manager and documented in the ACP.

Traffic to/from Post Office Account managed interface PCs/routers at other Outlets
(Post Office Ltd., Post Office Ltd. Clients etc) should be restricted (by routers and
firewalls) to:

© Authorised business traffic between the managed system and the particular Post
Office Account Data Centre server handling that link (normally just file transfer
between the systems).

« Network management traffic between the routers and the NMS.

© System management traffic between the PCs and Tivoli Management Centre

RADIUS Servers at the Data Centres authenticate traffic from managed PCs at Outlets.
The Radius Servers, which are-introducedused to authenticate -with- FRIACO ISDN and
ADSL network services for NBS, hold CHAP usernames and passwords for the live
estate, No operational Post Office traffic should be accepted via other routes. Firewalls
and Routers should also restrict where traffic can be routed to/from within the Data
Centre i.e, to VPN servers the Correspondence Servers, Tivoli management servers and
KMS.

When implementing a new or significantly changed Post Office Outlet, the initial
connection will be to a dedicated boot server. Access to this from the Post Office outlets
is via a firewall, which also restricts traffic between the boot server and the main
Horizon Data Centre LAN.

Firewalls and Routers should be configured to deny access to external users (e.g. CISCO
support) until this access has been agreed - see 4.6.3. When permitted, the appropriate
router should be configured to restrict access to the Data Centre to the particular
system(s) needing support.

3.7.3 Controlling Traffic within Data Centres

3.7.3.1

3.7.3.2

3.7.3.3

Controls in the Data Centre should reduce the possibility of interference between
systems by separating independent parts of the system, particularly where these which
have different security requirements. (This may be by a combination of network set-up,
router controls, controls at ports of specific systems and NFMICROSOFT domain
structure.) For example,

Systems concerned with Outlet Business Change should be separate from those used for
operational running.

Security services, e.g. the Key Management Service (KMS), shewld-be-wellmust_be
protected from unauthorised access from other systems.

Traffic originating within the Post Office Account Data Centres is generally initiated by
controlled applications. These applications (and the way they are configured in the
system) should restrict traffic between systems to the minimum necessary.

Additional network controls should be used where specific systems are subject to higher
risks or vulnerabilities in the Data Centre network. All such special cases should be
documented in the ACP.

3.7.4 Controlling Traffic at and from Post Office Account Project Sites

Post Office Account project sites include:

3.7.4.1

3.7.4.2

‘© Various systems and operational management sites and support sites
‘* The main Post Office Account management Sites

© The OBC Teams main site

* Offices used by Post Office Account Regional Managers

The main Post Office Account management sites should separate their main networks
from both the Fujitsu Corporate network and from those more secure LANs used to
access the Data Centre e.g. via a DMZ.

Most local users should only have access to specific LANs that provide access to local
services and (via controlled connections) to the Fujitsu Corporate network.

The only permitted connections from this management site network should be:

© To the Fujitsu Corporate network via a controlled router, which restricts traffic to

specifically that-permitted—authorised traffic only.

* To OBC users at regional offices and OBC suppliers at their sites via a controlled
router and firewalls.

© To the secure LANs via a firewall which restricts data to that permitted (e.g.
software from the Configuration Management system).

The only permitted connections from the secure LANs should be:
© To the Data Centres via encrypted links.

To other secure LANs via an encrypted link (i.e. between the Post Office Account
management sites).

All users with any interactive access to the Data Centres must do so via secure LANs
(see also 3.6.3)

Separate secure LANs should be used for separate user groups/activities where sensitive
data is being handled at Post Office Account management sites. For example, Security
Management and Audit users should be on a separate high security LAN separate from
other users.

Servers at the Post Office Account management sites that handle
sensitive/RESTRICTED data or are used to update the Data Centre require stronger
security and they-should therefore be on a secure LAN. This applies, for example, to the
CM signing server, which distributes software to the Data Centre and recor
database.

4.0 Specific Human Access Controls

4.1 Introduction

This chapterSection deals with access control polices, in particular authentication policies for
specialised human user roles and where exceptions to these polices are permitted.

Note that a full list of Post Office Account roles, outlining the IT access permitted to each of them,
is given in chapterSection 6.

4.2 Post Office Outlets — Operational and Installation Roles

There are no system management and support roles at the Post Office outlets. These tasks are run
remotely apart from some limited tasks available to Post Office managers.

4.2.1 Post Office Normal Running

For normal functions, Post Office Managers, Clerks and Supervisors authenticate using a Riposte
username and password.

On normal counter start up (once installation is complete) the Post Office Manager (or authorised
other user) uses the Post Office Memory card and PIN (which is also used in protecting the

filestore, as defined in the [SFS})-Security Functional Specification).

The following specialisations of the policies in chapterSection 3 apply in these cases.

4.2.1.1 A password cannot be re-used for 18 months.

4.2.1.2 The password is checked to conform to quality standards as follows:
© The password cannot contain spaces;
© The password cannot be one of an agreed “excluded passwords” list.

4.2.1.3 Afier a period of inactivity at a Post Office counter, the session will time out but can be

resumed on entry of the password. After a longer period of inactivity, the user is forcibly
logged out.

4.2.14 The PIN used for the Post Office Manager’s memory card is a 15 character
alphanumeric value.

4.215 The Post Office Manager should secure the Memory card and associated PIN in separate
places.

4.2.1.6 When a new Post Office user is added to the system, a full name must be supplied. This
ensures that the user can be identified from the user name included in the transaction
logged in the Riposte journals.

4.2.2 Customer Authentication at Post Office Outlets

For most Post Office operations, customers do not need to authenticate themselves.

4.2.3 Post Office Exceptional Cases except Installation

This subsection includes exceptional cases involving the Post Office Manager and other Post Office
staff and also supports engineers, Post Office Ltd. auditors and emergency managers.

For some user groups, and some exceptional circumstances, the Post Office Manager (or other
authorised person) authenticates using a one-time password with the assistance of the Horizon
System Help Desk (HSHD). The Post Office system generates a value, then phones the HSHD
authenticating to the HSHD as defined for that user role/circumstances (see Access Control and
User Administration Processes and Procedures).

{ACUAPPD}.-The HSHD. {after authenticating the user, } provides a check value that the user can
type in at the Post Office counter to authenticate themselves.

The following policies apply to these exceptions.

4.2.3.1 If there is a failure on booting the counter systems after installation of new software, the
Post Office Manager then reverts to the failsafe version of NT supported by HSHD and
using a one-time password.

4.2.3.2 If the Manager loses his password, he (or an authorised deputy in his absence) logs into
a SUPPORT username using a one-time password provided via the HSHD.

4.2.3.3 If the Manager loses his card or PIN, he obtains an emergency recovery key via the
HSHD (after authenticate to the HSHD).

4.2.3.4 Support engineers (installing new hardware and running tests to check it) and Auditors
use generic Riposte usernames for the appropriate role and authenticate via one-time
passwords. For both engineers and auditors, the pass number is also typed in; so
individual users can be identified in the log.

4.2.35 Ifa Post Office Ltd. Emergency Manager takes over a Post office when the manager is,
unavailable or unco-operative, he may use the emergency recovery procedure to boot up
the Post Office ~ see 4.2.3.3.

4.2.4 Installation Roles at Post Office Outlets

On installation of a Post Office Outlet,

© The installation engineer sets up the connection to the data centre
© The Post Office Manager (POM) completes the Post Office set-up for normal working
including set up of the memory card and PIN

4.2.4.1 The installation engineer must authenticate to the POM (see Visitor Authentication) prior
to using the Auto-configuration application, Authentication to NT-Microsoft or Riposte
must be impossible at this stage.

4.2.4.2 On first installation of the Post Office (after memory card set-up), the Manager logs in
under the Set-up Manager username to create his individual username. He then logs in
using this, and deletes the Set-up Manager username, On all future occasions, the POM
must authenticate using his individual user name except in cases identified in 4.2.3
above.

4.3 Corporate (including Security) Management Users

Unless stated otherwise, all corporate management users are authenticated to their local
N¥Microsoft domain using a security token. They use controlled NFMicrosofi workstations on
secure LANS at Post Office Account sites linked by encrypted links to the Data Centres (see site
type I in 3.6.3).

4.3.1 Business Management

These users may also need to authenticate to the relevant system and/or application for particular
systems. This is required for Oracle applications, and for Business Object universes used to access
data at Data Warehouse systems via Oracle/Business objects.

The only specialisation’s and exceptions to the policies in chapterSection 3 for these users are:

4.3.1.1 People in the following roles have access to CD writers at their workstations:

~ Management support users, who write agreed warehouse data to CD for transfer to
Post Office Ltd.

- The Business Function Auditor, who provides information to external auditors

= Security Management users for generation of key material.

4.3.2 Key Management

4.3.2.1 The Key Manager is responsible for the generation or other acquisition of cryptographic
keys and organising their distribution.

43.2.2 The Key Custodian uses the local console at the platform where the key is to be
installed/changed and authenticates using a token to the local system. (For NTMicrosoft,
this is defined as a local role.)

4.3.2.3. The Key Handler has the key on the appropriate media (e.g. floppy) for re-installation of
the key during system reboot. He is not a known user of the system and does not
authenticate to it.

4.3.24 The Key Handler role may be performed by identified, authorised (non-Post Office
Account) staff at remote Post Office Account managed systems e.g. by Post Office Ltd.
etc. at interface PCs at their sites.

4.3.2.5 The Cryptographic Key Manager and KMA Data Manager roles are SQL Server users,
so log-on to Oraele-Oracle, (after NFMicrosoft workstation, token logon). This gives
access to specific functions only.

4.4 Outlet Business Change Users

No specialisation to the policies in chapterSection 3 have yet been identified for OBC users, except
at the Post Office — see above.

4.5 System Management and Related Users

All system management, operational management and application support users have controlled
N¥Microsoft workstations for management/support activities, and a separate workstation for access
to call monitoring and other systems as in 3.6.3 site type 2 and 3.

4.5.1.1 SMC/HHFHSH teehnicians,technicians and other Tivoli users (e.g. Auditors, SSC
application support) authenticate to Tivoli as well as the workstation logon to
NFMicrosoft.

4.5.1.2 For Post Office Key Recovery, the SMC Team Leader may also need to log onto the
KMA via the specific KMS role created for this purpose.

4.5.13 SMC/HIF-HSH technicians also have limited read only access to some data centre
systems for the purposes of fault diagnosis. Access is via SSH client on the support
Terminal Server.

4.5.1.4 All network technicians access only the NMS and routers, so access for them is
described in that section.

4.5.15 Controlled access to floppy diskette and/or CD devices is permitted in exceptional
circumstances where such access is required in order to achieve the desired
functionality, e.g. on AP client remote platforms where diskette is the nominated media
for onward transmission of AP clients data, on Audit workstation from which extracts of
audited information are delivered on CD-ROM.

4.5.2 Engineering Access

4.5.2.1 Where possible, engineering access to the machines, for example, for hardware
diagnosis and repair, should be subject to the same controls as other users, as specified

in ehapterSection 3.

4.5.2.2 In agreed, limited circumstances, (e.g. when the operating system cannot be booted)
special access is permitted, by-passing the normal controls. In all such cases any visiting
engineer must be subject to the policies for “authentication of visitors” (see
chapterSection 3) and two people must be present during such acces

4.5.3 Procedures for getting in Support Staff

A number of problems can lead to staff being required to support the system. This could be Core
Services or SSC staff coming in to support the system from their normal support sites. However, it
could also require support staff from other organisations such as SequentSolaris or Cisco. Core
Services is generally responsible for the call out procedures.

4.5.3.1 All requests for technical support should be made to the Horizon System Help Desk. The
identity of the caller requesting support (if by telephone) should be verified to ensure the
call comes from an appropriate source, before being actioned. The Help Desk will pass
on the call to the appropriate unit in line with Help Desk Procedures using the call
handling system.

4.5.3.2 All support calls should be recorded in the call handling system and their progress
reported there, including who was called out and the actions taken,

4.5.3.3 Routers will by default, be configured to prevent access from support organisations other
than the SSC, SMC and the standard-Core Services. When support is required from
another authorised site (e.g. SequentSolaris or Cisco), a router should be configured to
allow this access, and then re-configured to disallow it after use.

4.5.4 Software Distribution and Exceptions for Fixes

4.5.4.1 All software (new software and fixes) must be registered in the configuration
management system controlled by configuration librarians. It should be tested using test
rigs and authorised by the CS Release Manager prior to distribution by Software
Distributors.

4.5.4.2 In exceptional circumstances, where this is not fast enough, authorised code fixes may
be done directly by Core Services according to agreed procedures.

4.5.5 Application Support

Application Support calls come via HSHD, from there they are forwarded to the appropriate unit.
Many application support calls are routed to SMG/HFFHORIZON SERVICE DESK for filtering
known errors, before being forwarded to System Support Centre (SSC) or Core Services as
appropriate for solving. Calls may sometimes be forwarded to other 3"! and potentially also to 4th
line support units, which may include application suppliers.

Note that no application support users have access to Post Office counter systems except as allowed
for in 4.5.5.2 below. Errors here are diagnosed using logs of events extracted via Tivoli.

4.5.5.1 All support users with access to the Post Office Account Data Centre must do so using
NMicrosoft controlled workstations in a secure workstation environment as defined in
3.3. (For SSC, the secure environment must include a firewall to restrict traffic between
the test rigs and the secure LAN, though the workstation gives access to both Data
Centres and test rigs.)

4.5.5.2 SSC access to the counter estate via SSH and may Limited-data-may-be- downloaded data
from the Data Centres to the-SSCan appropriate test rigs where this is required to assist
in diagnosing application problems and testing new software to fix the problem.

5.0 Specific System Access Controls

5.1 Introduction

This chapterSection deals with cases where the access control policies in chapterSection 3 are
specialised for particular systems and where exceptions to these policies are permitted.

In addition to the policies in ehapterSection 3, all systems should support the roles in ehapterSection
6, with only the required functions and resources available as defined there with the human access

Note: the ACP does not cover internal systems such as Powerhelp and PinICLPEAK.

5.2 Post Office outlets Platforms

A multi-counter Post Office has a local LAN with NMicrosoft workstations, one of which is the
gateway with a link to the Post Office Account Data Centres.

5.2.1 Human Users

The roles supported are Post Office staff (Post Office Manager, Counter Clerk and Supervisor),
Customer (indirectly), Post Office Ltd. Auditors and Emergency Managers, Engineers (Support and
Installation Engineers) and SSC (see 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4).

5.2.1.1 At no stage after leaving the factory should it be possible to logon directly to Windows
NENT and Windows 2000 or for a user to access NFMicrosoft functions or data.

5.2.1.2 No operational management roles should be supported at the Post Office systems, or any
other roles apart from than those listed above.

5.2.2 Factory Set-up Controls

Software is installed at the factory (though may be updated on installation) and initial configuration
done.

5.2.2.1 Riposte user groups set-up should be Manager, Supervisor, Clerk, Engineer, PinPad
Install, Auditor, AuditorE (used by Emergency Managers), Support (used for emergency
procedures such as the Manager forgetting his password). The Engineer, Auditor,
AuditorE and Support groups should be set up to require one-time password
authentication.

5.2.2.2 Usernames should be set up in Riposte and NFMicrosoft for an Engineer, an Emergency
Manager, a Support user and for a number of Auditors (enough to allow an auditor at
each counter of the largest Post Office) and a set-up manager associated with the
relevant Riposte groups. (The Post Office Manager will introduce further users later.)

5.2.2.3 When leaving the factory, it should only be possible to run the Auto-configuration
application, not log-on to NFMicrosoft or Riposte.

5.2.3.2 The encrypted filestore should not be accessible unless the workstation has been booted
using the memory card and PIN (or agreed emergency procedures).

5.2.3.3 Afier a user has logged on using Riposte, all access to the system should be controlled
by Riposte — the Riposte desktop should allow access to only those items available to
people in the user’s role, The user must not be able to call any other applications or
NFMicrosoft functions or resources. No direct access to Windows NFMicrosoft should
be possible at any time, even for engineers.

5.2.3.4 The Riposte infrastructure should not need NFMicrosoft administrator privilege.

5.3 SequentSolaris Systems
5.3.1 Introduction

‘equentSolaris systems withDynix-operating-system-and Oracle databases are used for the main
operational applications (see 2.1) andthe-DaiaWarehouse-(see-2.2}-at the Data Centres. The
systems also have data in flat files (e.g. before/after transfer to/from other systems).

5.3.2, Human Access

All SequentSolaris systems support the operational management and support roles listed in
chapterSection 6, They also support application roles for the particular applications such as ODBC,
RDMC and Business Objects. for access1o- Date Warehouse data

5.3.2.1 All business users (such as the Business Support unit) should use Oracle applications —
Oracle Forms, Business Objects or Discover3i.

5.3.2.2 Where the SQL*Net or Oracle NET-8 access to the database could potentially give more
access than that permitted for the business role, the application at the client must restrict
access to that permitted. In addition, a secure controlled workstation conforming to Post
Office Account policies (see 3.2) must be used and the user identified there with the
correct role so that the application controls cannot be by-passed.

5.3.2.3 Users using only Oracle via applications on their controlled workstations should be
registered to the Oracle application, not the underlying operating system, and
authenticate using a password.

5.3.2.4 Where users need to be both UNIX and Oracle users, they should be registered in UNIX,
and have Oracle use the result of the UNIX (and security token) authentication.

5.3.2.5 Oracle database administration functions should use:

* Pre-defined Discover queries to examine the state of the database. (Discoverer
should be configured to restrict access to the tables and views needed for the task
and audit actions.)

* Predefined, authorised SQL*Plus for database updates (which should include
auditing)

Application support users of Oracle should use:

© Pre-defined forms for correcting standard types of data problem

© Pre-authorised SQL*Plus scripts for correcting other data problems

All pre-defined forms and pre-authorised scripts should audit the correction made.

Users who require any access to operating system facilities must do so via a secure menu
system that restricts the user to functions authorised for users of that role (and audits all
functions performed by that user).

Where a function called from the secure menu system requires a change of username,
that change should be done automatically by the menu system and audited. Changes to
username must also cause a Patrol event.

The secure menu system should have specific functions for most system management
activities. However, for emergency use, the menu will include an item that provides root
access and use of UNIX commands.

Computer operators access SequentSolaris systems from the console, using the secure
menu system to access a limited number of predefined jobs such as back-ups.

Engineering access when the operating system cannot be fully booted, is via “single user
mode” under controlled conditions (see Visitor Authentication and Engineering Access),
Single user mode should only be used when more controlled methods are not possible.

Operational management staff must always authenticate under their own names to UNIX
and perform functions wherever possible without superuser/root privileges. If root is
needed, the appropriate menu item on the secure menu system will be used to switch
users. This will be audited and an alert sent to BMC Patrol so a record remains available
even if the audit log at the UNIX machine is subsequently corrupted.

Where non-Post Office Account, e.g. SequeniSolaris staff provide 3rd line support, this
may be from the 3rd party site. In this case, access must be from a controlled
N¥Microsoft workstation and controlled environment as for Post Office Account
operational management - see 3.2. Call in procedures are as in 4.5.3.

As SeqientSolaris requires root access, an independent monitoring system will be used
where all key strokes on the SequeniSolaris workstation are captured and echoed on a
Core Services workstation.

Information available to people doing ad-hoc queries should be further constrained e.g.
using Business Object universes.

Note that there are also roles for non-human users.

Dynix Solaris and Oracle Access Controls

The Dynix Solaris operating system should be set-up according to the access control
policy in 3 above.

Automated processes should do all loading/unloading of data to/from Oracle databases.
Separate interface tables should be used to restrict the damage possible due to failures
during automated processes.

The set-up of the system should be regularly monitored, for example, to check for
dormant accounts and to review any changes made to important system files.

5.4 Windows NT and Windows 2000 Systems

This section deals with NF-Microsoft workstations and servers at the Data Centres and other Post
Office Account managed NT-Microsofi_systems except the Post Office outlets. MicrosoftNT
workstations at secure Post Office Account management and support sites should also conform to
these policies, and the NT domain policies.

5.4.1 Generic NF Microsoft Policies

NF—Microsoft_systems support the operational management and support roles listed in
chapterSection 6 unless otherwise stated.

5.4.1.1 As on other systems, engineers should only have controlled access and must be
accompanied by Core Services staff when using the system.

5.4.1.2 Apart from event logs etc, which are relevant to all NFMicrosoft systems, application
support users should access application databases via relevant tools, rather than just
operating system facilities.

5.4.13 All NFMicrosoft servers should be set up with a group and template user for the generic
management and support roles (plus any others defined for the particular NFMicrosoft
system). When a user is assigned to a role these templates should be used to set up that
user with the required user profile providing access only to those tools needed to carry
out the role.

5.4.14 While use of NFMicrosoft domains allows a user to log in once to multiple servers,
some roles (such as Engineer and Key Custodian) should always be defined as requiring
the user to be local to the machine.

5.4.2. NT Domain Policies

Windows N¥Microsoft domains are used in Post Office Account to control which NFMicrosoft
servers can share NFMicrosofi resources and which users have access to those resources. They are
also used to simplify user authentication — a user need only logon once to a domain (or once to a set
of domains) which have an established trust relationship that includes trust in the users of the
domains.

N¥Microsoft domains should conform to the following polici

5.4.2.1 N¥Microsoft domains should generally have at least one Backup Domain Controller.
This should be on a separate site from the Primary Domain Controller. Exceptions to this
must be agreed and are expected to be small domains with few users.

5.4.2.2 Where a set of related NFMicrosoft systems is run by a different authority from other
NFMicrosoft systems, this should be set up as a separate domain,

5.4.2.3 Where such a domain does not share users or resources with other domains, it should be
a separate domain with no trust relationship with other domains.

Domains may span sites where all NFMicrosoft workstations and servers in the domain
are run by the same authority and are subject to the same physical and network security.
(For example, the SMC system management domain spans the SMC workstations
attached to a secure LAN on the secure SMC Site and the Tivoli NTMicrosoft servers at
the Data Centre).

A domain must be confined within an area of the network, which is subject to the same
security policies and controls. For example, it must not include NFMicrosoft systems on
different sides of a firewall.

Where sharing of resources, but not users, is required between domains, then the trust
between domains should be restricted to sharing the agreed resources/files across the
domain boundary. The resource sharing must be restricted to the minimum required for
the agreed functions.

Where sharing of files is required between domains on different sides of a firewall, this
should be subject to special authorisation procedures as well as the policy above

A domain should not establish trust in users registered in a domain in a less trusted part
of the network.

Users should only have access to the NFMicrosoft systems to which they are permitted
access. The domain set up should prevent them accessing any other NFMicrosoft
systems.

is at the application level, for example, from a remote client via an application protocol

interference between them.

Correspondence Servers

Business Support and Auditor access to the operational Correspondence servers should
be restricted to exceptional circumstances for limited amounts of data (as otherwise, the
performance of the system could be impaired). In all cases, access should be controlled,
and limited to use of a specific agreed query tool.

Security Servers on NFMicrosoft

Security services on NFMicrosoft are:

The Key Management Application (KMA) which generates and distributes cryptographic
keys to Horizon services and the Post Office outlets. An associated Certification Authority
Workstation (CAW) generates public key certificates and Entropy servers that generate
DSA entropy for digital signatures.

(This is in addition to the software security services to protect data in transit on particular links.)

5.4.4.1 The Certification Authority Workstation (CAW) that includes the CA should be off-line
—not connected to any network.

5.4.4.2 The KMA should store all keys encrypted, and the key used to encrypt these keys should
be subject to the normal KEK policies ~ see 3.5.

5.4.43 Application level access to the KMA should be restricted to the agreed functions for
each of the specified roles, and each role should have the least privilege needed to do the
job. All security significant actions should be audited

5.4.44 On-line interactive access by human users to the NFMicrosoft server on which the KMA
resides should not be generally possible. It should require approval by the Post Office
Account Security Manager to permit this access (except for key handling on reboot). The
access will only ever be permitted for:

© Read only access by application support staff (updates should always be via the
standard Tivoli software distribution)

© Limited, authorised, system admin access by local users

© Engineers

5.5 Authentication Service for Authentication using Tokens

Authentication using tokens will be supported by an Authentication Service at each Data Centre
(one the master, generally used for all authenticationauthentications, with the other acting as a slave
to provide resilience).

5.5.1.1 After installation and configuration of the Authentication Service, the only application
access to the Authentication service should be by the Post Office Account Security
Manager workstation at the Post Office Account management site. These must be
controlled NFMicrosoft workstations on the secure LAN (see chapterSection 3).

5.6 Cryptographic Boxes

5.6.1 Hardware Encryption Boxes

Hardware encryption boxes are used to provide link level encryption on a number of links. These
are government approved point-to-point encryption devices generally using Rambutan encryption
but can operate with commercial encryption algorithms where this is agreed.

an internal system, which regularly checks the disks against predefined thresholds such as numbers
of failed read or write attempts. When a threshold is exceeded, the disk monitoring system
automatically telephones the EMC support unit.

the special EMC client

5.8 Interface Systems at Business and Outlet Business Change

The Horizon system manages interface PCs at some related Outlets (Post Office Ltd., Post Office
Ltd. Clients and Outlet Business Change supplier). It also manages the interfaces to the Post Office
Account network(network (e.g. routers.)

In all cases, routers are managed by Post Office Account Network Management and interface PCs
are managed using Horizon System Management,

5.8.1 Interface Systems with Interface PCs

Post Office Account has links to a number of Post Office Account managed interface PCs at Sites
remote from the Post Office Account Data Centres. These include Post Office Ltd. and Post Office
Lid. Client systems. (The Post Office Ltd. TIP link is also used for Royal Mail traffic.) There may
also be interface systems at Post Office Account Outlet Business Change Suppliers.

5.8.1.1 Once configured, the PCs and routers at these sites should not normally have any human
access ~ file transfers should be automated and the PCs managed remotely using Tivoli.

repaired when configured into the operational system.

Business data in transit to the Data Centres is protected as defined in 3.7 above.

Where the PC is directly connected to other systems (such as the Post Office Ltd. ones),
it should also be configured to restrict traffic with such systems.

Controls at the interface PCs at Post Office Ltd. (and similar) sites must ensure
separation of incoming and out going files so that all files supplied by Post Office
‘Account are read only for Post Office Ltd. access. In addition, files for different systems
(e.g. TIP, Royal Mail and Reference Data) are separated.

5.9 System Management Servers.

A set of Tivoli system management servers are used to manage the Post Office systems and related
Data Centre NFMicrosoft systems (mainly using Tivoli products). They also monitor other Post
Office Account management systems and collect event data from other systems.

Authentication Service)

In addition to SSC and SMC/HEF-HSH roles, Tivoli servers should also support:

© Post Office Account Security Auditors with read access to audit information via the
web interface — platform audit logs, Tivoli notices, and Tivoli events collected for
auditing.

© Application support users with access to pre-authorised Tivoli tasks to extract
diagnostic information from the Post Office.

& ISDN adaptors

Figure 5-1 Network Management

There is a single Network Management Station (NMS) at each Post Office Account Data Centre.
NMS users use controlled NFMicrosoft workstations with tokens (see section 3) but also need to
log onto UNIX for access to authorised OpenView and Cisco Works/View functions.

In addition to NMS roles, there are also Cisco router support roles. Engineers may also require
direct access to routers.

There are no on-line application support roles. Support of Open View, Cisco Works etc is done off-
line. Post Office Account auditors access audit information from the NMS via audit records sent
through to Tivoli and extracted audit logs.

5.10.1.1 Network Management configuration must be carried out before live running and the
configuration independently validated and authorised by a senior Core Services network
person before use.

5.10.1.2. Even though network management workstations run 24 hours a day, all users must still
be individually authenticated. (This implies that at the end of the shift, the existing user
must log out and the new user log on.)

5.10.13 Network management should normally be done using OpenView. In agreed exceptional
circumstances (for example, for fault resolution requiring use of the debug facility, in
times of excessive network workload or during fault conditions), the network may be
managed using router facilities directly via telnet, not via Open View, and therefore not
subject to its controls. This is confined to authorised Core Services Network Managers
using Telnet access to routers from a specific dedicated NFMicrosoft system on the
Operational Bridge area of the Network Centres.

Telnet access to routers is permitted only to Core Services senior network management
staff and Cisco staff supporting the routers from a remote CISCO site, All such access
must be authorised by a member of the Telnet authorisation list. Manual records must be
kept of this authorisation each time Telnet access is used

All users of Telnet access to routers must authenticate using TACACS+ and their access
audited at the NMS.

Cisco staff must access the router needing support via a separate gateway router
dedicated for Cisco use. This gateway router must be configured to permit Cisco access
only when Cisco support is needed. A different TACACS username and password must
be used on each occasion, valid for the particular session only.

The standard Cisco engineers must have only read access to the routers. Only named and
authorised senior CISCO staff may have the—“the “enable” mode needed for reviewing
configuration files and debugging. CISCO staff should not make changes to the routers,
but advice the Network Manager of any changes required

The only direct access permitted to routers is for engineers investigating hardware
problems. In this case, access should always be done locally at the router using a
console.

In normal running, the routers must not have consoles attached, though console access
may be enabled. Any attempt to log-on at a console should be via TACACS+ and so be
flagged at the NMS.

A faulty router must be configured out of the network before a console is attached and
the router engineer logs on to diagnose and repair the fault. When the router is connected
back into the system, its configuration must be checked and the new configuration
authorised before the router is configured for normal use in the operational system.

Engineers are not individually known to the routers, so manual procedures must identify
the engineer when he visits the site before he is given today’s password. The password
used for direct router console access should be changed via the NMS every 28 days and
also immediately when an engineer requires access.

5.10.2 Firewall Management

Firewalls are managed using Enterprise Centres on Solaris systems (shared with Security token
management), one at each Data Centre.

Enterprise Centre roles supported are Firewall Manager and Firewall Monitor. There are no on-line
support roles for the Enterprise Centre application or the firewall application.

‘Centse-and logged via Tivoli. Firewall audit logs should also be sent to the Enterprise
Centre.

Firewalls should restrict traffic as in the network access policies in 3.7. (This is different
for different firewalls).

5.11 Software Distribution Servers

Software distribution servers include the Configuration Management and associated signing servers
on Post Office Account project Outlets and the depot/Tivoli servers at the Data Centres to which
software is sent for onward transmission to other Horizon systems at the Data Centres, Post Office
outlets and elsewhere.

5.11.11

5.11.1.2

The Configuration management system should have access controls, which conform to
this policy, even though it is not at the data centre, or on a separate secure LAN.

The associated signing server should be on the secure LAN, and controls should be fully
conformant with this policy.

5.12 OBC Servers at the Data Centres

The Post Office counters are delivered with a standard configuration, which needs to be
personalised and updated when installed.

The servers involved in this process are shown in the following diagram.
