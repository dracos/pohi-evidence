Dear Ms Linnell
Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme ("the Scheme")
We refer to our letter today to Mr Alan Bates confirming that the Working Group is to be closed.

Please could you send to Post Office a final invoice for any services you have provided to JFSA this
month in relation to the Scheme, up to the limit of £2,000 + VAT.

For the avoidance of doubt, there is no contractual arrangement in place, or obligation on Post Office,
in relation to the payment of your fees. Post Office will however pay your final invoice but no further
payments will made after that.

{POL — please confirm that all Kay's other invoices have already been paid. If not, the final sentence
needs tweaking.]

Yours sincerely

Jane MacLeod
General Counsel
For and on behalf of Post Office Limited
