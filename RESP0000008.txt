FAO: Segun Jide, Solicitor to the Inquiry, Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Dear Mr Jide,
Re: —- Volume 1 of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry Report — Fujitsu Services Limited

We refer to Volume I of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry Report dated 6 June 2025 (published
8 July 2025) (the “Volume 1 Report”), in which the Chair makes 19 recommendations.

Recommendation 19 of the Volume I Report recommends that, “/b/y 3/ October 2025, the
Department, Fujitsu and the Post Office shall publish, either separately or together, a report
outlining any agreed programme of restorative justice and/or actions taken by that date to produce
such a programme. For the avoidance of any doubt, the word Fujitsu in this recommendation is
intended to include both Fujitsu Services Limited and Fujitsu Limited”

Enclosed with this letter is a joint statement by Post Office Limited, Fujitsu Services Limited and
the Department for Business and Trade in response to Recommendation 19. This joint statement in
turn refers to a report prepared by the Restorative Justice Council dated 20 October 2025 (the “RJC
Report”). A copy of the RJC Report is enclosed.

As described at §4.322 of the Volume I Report, a meeting took place on 7 March 2025 between
the former Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Mr Jonathan Reynolds MP, Mr Paul Patterson
of Fujitsu Services Limited and Mr Takahito Tokita of Fujitsu Limited. The topic of restorative
justice was not discussed at that meeting. Given that the pilot restorative justice programme outlined
in the joint statement and RJC Report relates to matters solely within the United Kingdom, it is not
envisaged that Fujitsu Limited will have any direct involvement.

Fujitsu Services Limited reiterates its commitment to rendering every assistance to the Inquiry and
is grateful to the Inquiry for the opportunity torespond to Recommendation 19. Should the Inquiry
