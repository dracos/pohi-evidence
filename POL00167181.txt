Subject: RE: Transaction Errors - West Byfleet

Attachment: TCs and HK.xis

John / Warwick,

I've spend a little bit of time this afternoon looking at this.

Attached is a spreadsheet that combines John's TCs (sheet POL TCs) with an extract from the detailed Logs of all TC's
Made Good and Housekeeping transactions (sheet Audit TCs and Hk).

I've added a col F to sheet POL TCs and col Y to sheet Audit TCs and HK cross referencing the equivalent rows in the
two sheets. Note that I only have data from 1/12/06 to 31/12/07.

Sheet TC summary shows all the cash movements resulting from TCs and this only amounts to -£1,619.43 in that period.
Looking at John's spreadsheet there are some large TCs outside the period and also to non cash products. (The total of
TCs to Cash is £23,718.87, but I'm not sure how relevant that is. For example the TC on 31/8/07 for £19,260 has no
affect on the cash position of the branch. There were also large TCs in Jan 2008 - presumably as a result of the audit -
to correct the accounts and so probably aren't relevant.)

What could still be looked at is any correlation between TC acceptances and cash movements in Declarations, but I don't
have time for that at present.

Hope this helps.
Regards
Gareth
