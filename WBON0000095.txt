                    business each day, the subpostmaster and any assistant logs on to their
                    computer. They                                                              all transactions they perfo!m on their computers.

                    keyboard. The computer system in the branches is called Horizon. Horizon is in
                    effect, a sophisticated computerised calculator.


      7. So far as I recall, every t-arsaction recorded by the subpostmaster and his
                     assistant                   to their computer has one or sometimes more corresponding

                telephone by Mr Castleton who told me that on week 39 (the week. ending .:23
                   December 2003), he had been £1,1.00 short in his Cash Account. We discussed
                 what might be a usual explanation for this, for example the Giro Bank error or
                cheque deposits going through as cash. I suggested that he contact Giro Bank and
                   National Savings to see if there were any problems.                                                                                                                                              I also asked him to make

Shortfalls in January 2004


12. In accordance with my normal visiting plan, I visited the Marine Drive branch on
    Friday 16 January 2004. At the time, no reason had come to light to explain the
    loss of £1,100. The previous 3 weeks' balances seemed to be fine.
                                                                       -k~,'8      o _2          t'

13. Referring back to the summary of events that I prepared at the time (pages 130-
   134), I am reminded that on or around 21 January 2004 (Cash Account week 43)
   Mr Castleton contacted me because his balance of the physical cash and stock
    against the cash and stock shown on their computers was over £4,000 short. A
    copy of the Cash Account he signed for we       3' if at pages '        to 245a. I again
    asked him to contact Giro Bank and National Savings to see whether there were
    any problems. I also asked him whether the cash was kept secure and who had
    access to it. Mr Castleton did not believe that any of his staff could have taken the
    money. He stated that on this occasion, he was unable to make good the shortfall.
    I advised him to contact the helpline to get a hardship form. (A subpostmaster is
    contractually obliged to make good any shortfalls without delay.            However if a
    subpostmaster cannot immediately make goods the shortfalls, he may complete
    and submit a hardship form setting out details of his earnings and other relevant
    information to seek the Post Office's permission to make good the shortfalls by
    instalment payments rather than immediately).


14. We also discussed at length ways for him to double check all of the paperwork
    leaving the Marine Drive branch (for example, the giro paying in slips, pension.. and
    allowance dockets and certain types of cheques) and to perform a balance
    snapshot each evening to check the cash. (Effectively, a balance snapshot is just
    a facility to allow the subpostmaster to quickly check transactions through the
    week. It is a report that contains what the computer records should be the total
    cash in stock figure, not what cash the branch actually does have. It looks at the
    previous week's declared cash in stock and adjusts items as they are sold thereby
    showing the amount the branch would need to achieve a perfect balance.
    However, if for example someone forgets to enter an item that a customer has
    purchased, then the balance snapshot figure will be inaccurate, by showing less
    cash than is actually in the till. If on the other hand, the customer is given too
    much change or is overpaid (for example, a pension), the balance snapshot will
    show more money than is actually present in the till),             if the figures 'n the

    paperwork leaving the branch did not come close to the balance snapshot, this
    ought to alert the subpostmaster that something was wrong.


15. 1 contacted Mr Castleton by. telephone on or around 28 January 2004 (Cash
    Account week 44). After he said he as a further £2,500 short, again, we had a
    lengthy discussion to discuss all the daily workings. A copy of the Cash Account
    for that week signed by Mr Castleton is at pages 246-25y5. I brought up in the
    conversation the possibility that somebody might be taking the cash, but Mr
    Castieton discounted that possibility.       I isugested that he carry, out




                                                                                  individual
    stock unit balancing. Small pest offices such as the Marine Drive branch which has
    2 cashier positions run a shared stock system: All the cash and stock is contained
    on 1 balance sheet. However, with individual stock balancing, each computer has
    it; own separate stock and cash balance. Mr Castleton did :n.ot wish to'do•this, as
    he felt that Marine Drive branch did not lend itself to doing this sort of balancing. 1
    was surprised that Mr Gastleton did. not take up my suggestion because although
    there is some work involved .setting up individual stock balancing it would have
    enabled us to identify whether the losses were caused by any individual cashier.


Shortfalls in February 2004


16. The next week ended 5 February 2005, (Cash Account week 45) the Marine Drive
    branch was £25 over. (A copy of the Cash Account signed by Mr Gastleton is pages
    256-267).. However, the week after ending 31 February 2004 (Cash Account week
    46) the .Marine Drive branch was £1,500 short (A copy of the Cash Account signed
    by Mr Gastleton is at pages 268-279)          5y now, after just 4 weeks, the Marine
    Drive branch was a total of £8,243.10 short, not counting the sum of E1,100 that
    Mr Castleton had made good to start with.          I visited the Marine Drive branch
    around this time at which time I would have looked at the latest Cash Accounts. I.
    asked Mr Castleton whether he had obtained a Hardship Form. He said that he
              t
    hadn't and told 'him to get one. I understand that he did, and he made a book
    entry which transferred the sum of E8,243-10 into          the Suspense Account.

    and Mr Castleton should not have been rolling them over each week. The purpose.
    of having a Suspense Account was simply so that a.shortfall . that a subpostmaster
    does not immediately made good could be temporarily moved to the Suspense
    Account rather than being left in the Cash Account          By this time, 'I was very
    concerned and contacted the investigations team.            The investigations team
    investigate cases of fraud where dishonesty has been involved.         Given that Mr
    Castleton had kept me informed of the losses, this was not         a case which they

    would investigate. I also completed an audit request so that the audit team would
    carry out an audit.


17. In Cash Account week 48 (the week ending 25 February2004) the short fall for
    that week alone was E3,509.18. . (A copy of the Cash Account signed by Mr
    Castleton is at   pag6s 292-304).   Mr Castleton informed me that he and his
    assistant Mrs Christine Train spent many hours double checking the transaction
    logs to try to prove that it was the computer equipment that was changing the
    figures. I asked him if he had found anything, but he had not. However, he was
    convinced teat since he had a processor changed about the time the losses started
    occurring that it was the processor that was causing the losses.
                                                                   I asked Mr
    Castleton to contact Fujitsu services (who were responsible for designing,
    implementing and operating the Horizon system) to obtain.a system check.. He did.
    this and the system check came back fine; I asked Mr Castleton to contact the
    Horizon system help)ine (HSH) which he did and I understand that he sent Cash
    Accounts to the National Business Support Centre (NBSC) to review. I also asked
    Mr Castleton to contact the Post Offices Transaction Processing section to see
    whether there were any error notices pending. So fares I was aware, there was
    nothing untoward with the computer system.


18. On 27 February 2004, 1 again visited the Marine Drive branch..   Again we discussed
    the losses shown in the various Cash Account :figures.      Mr Castleton became
    distressed and angry and Mrs Train was also upset.     i asked them what else I
    could do to help, given that we had previously discussed all the usual ways that a
    subpostmaster could incur shortfalls. Mr Castleton and Mrs Train repeated that
    they had not taken the -money and that it must be the Horizon system. Mr
    Castleton stated that HSH had Confirmed that the Horizon system was working
    correctly, but he was not sure precisely what HSH had checked.


19. Mr Castleton thought that the 2 computer processors were not communicating
    with each other.    I advised that if the 2 computer processors were not
     communicating, then work done on the second machine would not show up on the
     summary sheets. However, all the Pensions and Allowances reports and the Giro
     Bank receipts agreed with the information from the computer, which to me
     suggested that there was no computer error.


20. Mr Castleton also thought that when he "remmed in" the stock, the Horizon system
    altered the figures. (When stock or cash ("a remittance") is delivered to a branch,
    the subpostmaster is obliged to physically check that the stock and cash matches

     the accompanying list of stock Which the Post Office say is being delivered.                  The
     subpostmaster enters the details of the remittance into the branch's computer,
     which is called "`remming in").    To prove whether or not the Horizon system had.
     changed anything, I suggested that at the end of the day after close of business
     he:

     a:          firstly print out an end of day snapshot;


     b,          remmed in; and then


     c.          print out a second snapshot.




Shortfalls in March 2004


21. At some point in or around March 2004 1 looked                  the Cash Accounts for that

                                                             at
    month and noted that:


    (a) In the week ending 3 March 2004 (Cash Account week 49), Mr Castleton
           transferred the previous weeks balance to the Suspense Account.                        The
           Suspense Account then totalled £11,752.78.             In addition, the Marine Drive
           branch signed Cash Account showed a further shortage of £3,512.26 (pages
           305-316). Mr Castleton did not make good this amount.                  rA:""y   e s( — 2-7,, 'j

    (b) In the week ending 10 March 2004 (Cash Account week 50) the previous
           week's shortage of £3,512.26 was rolled over and the shortage in the signed
           Cash Account increased to £10,653.11 (pages 317-328).                 p 27' i

    (c) in the week ending 17 March 2004 (Cash Account week 51), the Marine Drive
           branch showed a shortage in the Cash Account of £11,210.56                       plus the
           shortage in the Suspense Account of £11,752.78 (pages 329-344).




Audit on 23 March 2004


22. On 23. March 2004, Helen Rose (nee Hollingworth) of the Post Office carried out an
    audit of the Marine Drive branch together with Chris Taylor.          This was the first date
    that the audit could take place due to the other work commitments of the audit

                                                                                                 WBON0000095




    team.       The audit concluded that there was a total unauthorised shortfall at that
    stage of £25,758.75 (page 135).


23. I arrived at the Marine Drive branch in the afternoon of 23 Match 2004 -and took
    Mr Castleton into the back room to speak to him.                  I told hire that as a
    precautionary measure, and with his permission, I would like to remove him and
    his staff from the Marlene Drive branch and to operate the branch with a temporary
    subpostmaster       to see   how   it   would     balance.   I   wanted   the   temporary
    subpostmaster to retain the same lion :on system that Mr Castleton and his team
    had been working with to try and keep everything the same. Mr Castleton and his
    assistant Mrs Train were both angry. Mr Castleton said that he could not wait Until
    the temporary subpostmaster was "thousands short next week" and that "heads
    will roll" for the distress that he had suffered.


24. On the same day, Lesley Joyce (the Post Office's contract manager) wrote to Mr
    Castleton to confirm that he was suspended as a precautionary measure pending
    further investigations (page 137)        *          4   .



Events following Mr Castleton's suspension


25. I asked a very experienced post master, Mrs Ruth Simpson, from the First Lane
    Post Office in Hull if she would run the Marine Drive branch on a temporary basis.
    Mrs Simpson agreed, but was only able to run the Marine Drive branch for a few
    weeks as she had other commitments.              She opened the Marine Drive branch on
    the morning of Wednesday 24 March 2004 and balanced £2,.14 short on that night.
    (A copy of the Cash Account dated 24 March 2004 at pages 345 to 350.).                She
    brought with her a part time assistant to telp out on Mondays. On the :close of
    business on the first Monday (, .h e week ending 31 March 2004), she was £100
    short and explained that she thought that this was because her assistant had left
    something in the stack and erroneously paid this amount twice. (The stack is an
    onscreen list of transactions for the individual customer that is being servers at the
    time. Each time a new customer is served, the stack should be cleared so -chat it
    starts from zero). A copy of the Cash Account for that week is at pages 351-356.

26. 1 telephoned Mr Castle-ton to -see what his reaction would be. He stated that Mrs
    Simpson was only using 1 computer rather than 2 as he had done, so it was riot a
    true reiiection o f how he ran the 5larrne Drive branch, He also stated that firs
    Sirnosc:r had niisbaianced (i.e there        as a shortfall of £100). I said that 1 .could
    speak .its Ms Simpson raga -di fg iris concerns: I contacted her and asked her to

     use 'both machines. She stated that on a Monday she had 2 people working all
     day, so 2 machines were used; The rest -of the week she was on her own, but
     logged on to the system with 2 usernames and had 2 machines running, she was
     serving customers from both machines, returning in on both and putting the lottery
     cash on both.


27. On the week ending. 7 April 2004 (Cash Account week 02), Mrs Simpson was
     £19.38 over (pages 357-362). We discussed how she was getting on every other
     day and she would text me to confirm that she was okay. On her next balance for
     the week ending 14 April 2004 (Cash Account week 03) she was £'10.76 short
     (pages 363-368):.


28. On 16 April :2004, 1 visited the Marne Drive branch and spoke to Mr Castleton
      away from the counter, since the retail shop and the Post Office counter were -still
      open..      He Sivas distressed. We discussed Mrs Simpson's balancing results.   Mrs
      Train wanted to know where the £100 shortage had gone in Mrs Simpsons first
      full week and I explained what she had thought. Mrs Train became aggressive and
      threatening. I said that I felt the balance reflected any normal Sub-Post Office Mr
      Castleton again stated -t hat it was the computer that was making the losses. I told
      Mr Castleton that Mrs Simpson would be finishing on Wednesday 21 April 20,04
     due to other commitments and said that I Wanted 'more time and more balance
     results and wanted another tenorary subpostmaster to take over. Mr Castleton
     said that he did not wish to go back on the counter as things stood anyway.


29. On the week ending. Wednesday 21 April 2004) (Cash Account week. 04.) there was.
      a surplus for the week of £0.02 (pages 369-374),       Mr Greg Booth took over as
      temporary Sub-Postmaster on the same day. He completed his first week on
      Wednesday 28 April 2004 and declared a gain of £14.76 (pages 375-380),


30. On 23 April, Mr Franks (Mr Castleton 's father-in-taw) contacted me by telephone
      to discuss the way in which Mr and Mrs Castleton had been treated. I explained
      the situation and told him that the suspension was a precaution and that I was
      hoping that by having a temporary Sub-Postmaster in the office, that if there were
      any problems with the computer equipment, this would come to light Mr *-ranks
      demanded that Mr Castleton be reinstated immediately. I referred him to the Post
      Office Head of Area, David Mellows-Facer and told him that I could not agree to
      reinstate Mr Castleton at the time. I understand that Mr Franks spoke with David
      Mellows -Facer and asked for a speedy conclusion to the situation. David Mellows-

                 unexplained losses over the preceding 12 weeks. I stated                                                                                          t    h at                   he was unable

                 the obvious risk to Post Office funds. I explained that there are   number of

                 obligations set out within the Contract, ore of which is that the appointment is
                 dependant upon the branch being well managed and the work performed to the.
                 satisfaction of the Post Office (section 1, paragraph 5).                                                                                         I also referred him to
             section 12, paragraph 12 of the Contract (page 60), This provides that:


                           "the Subpostmaster is responsible for all losses caused by his own
                           negligence, carelessness or error and also for losses of all kinds caused by

                           delay."


                 I also explained that Section 1, paragraph W of the Contract '{page 21) provides
                 that it can be determined at any time in case of a breach of condition by the
                 subpostmaster or non-performance of his obligation, or non-provision of Post
                 Office services. I asked him to explain the reasons why his contract should not'be
                 terminated surnmarily and that he could do this by requesting a personal interview
                 or submitting a response to the

     that would not be reported because it was such a small error. Everything else was
     fine.


34.. Mr Castleton telephoned me on 4 May 2.004 and stated that tie had found E15,000
     of the losses. If assumed he had done this by going back over the hard copies of
     the accounts that he had. I asked him where he had found the cash. He stated
     that the Suspense Account had doubled the figures. When he had put the cash
     into the Suspense Account, although the amount was showing in the Suspense
     Account, It was also still showing as a loss in the Cash Account again the next
     week. Mr Castleton asked for the Suspense Account software to be checked. I
     again contacted the NBSC to request this.


35, To test whether the ;Suspense Account was having any effect on the balance, I
     contacted the temporary S.ub-:Postmaster, Greg Booth on or around 5 May 2004.. I
     asked him how he was balancing that week on his snapshots. He told me that he
     had a few pounds over. I told Mr Booth what Mr Castleton had said about the
     Suspense Account. I asked, Mr Booth to put E100 into the shortages line on the
     Suspense Account. First he ran an office snapshot (pages 387-388) then he
     placed the E tOO into the account, then he ran a second snapshot (pages 389-390)
     and a Suspense Account report (pages 391-392). During this time, the same
     Horizon kit was still being used by the assistant. The £100 was In the correct place
     and the cash figure on the snapshot had changed by £100. This demonstrated that
     the system worked correctly; I asked Mr Booth to balance eith those amounts still
     in the account; He should balance £100 over. I would then call into the Marine
     Drive branch on 7 May 2004 and we would take the amount out, to see if the
     opposite occurred. Mr Booth. left me a message on my telephone later that
     evening to state that he had balanced over, just as we had expected.


36. For the week ending 5 May 2004 (Cash ;Account week 0.b), the Marine Olive
     branch declared a small gain of £103.11 (pages 381-386).     ?   r       ' •~   '

39. On 6 May 2004, I also contacted the Transaction Processing Department at
                  Chesterfield again to check whether there were any outstanding errors. Only the
                  easy access error was sti ll showing.                           I also contacted Mr Castieton by telephone
                  and informed him                         that I had received his letter and was doing all I could to get
                  him the information he had requested. I said that I would probably not be able to
                  obtain everything that he had asked for.


40. On 7 May 2004, I visited Greg Booth at the                                                                                       branch, as arranged.

                                               Castleton




41. On 10 May 2004, 1 interviewed Mr Castleton. Ms Lesley Joyce (Contract Manager)
                  and Mrs Train were also present. A copy of the Minutes of the inter -e\1 meetinc
                  are at pages 177-179. At the interview, I explained that it was his opportunity to
                  give any explanation as to why this contract for services should not be terminated.
                     I summarised the events which lead to his suspension on 2:3 March 2004 due to an
                                            shortage at that                           £25,758.75. Dn+r€nq ' he 12 weeks p it                                to

     this audit, the Marine Drive branch had several large unexplained losses. the
     figure for cash on the system was not the same as the physical amount,of cash at-
     the Marine Drive branch.     Mr Castleton stated that the Horizon system was to
     blame.


42. 1 informed Mr Castleton 'that since he had been suspended, the same Horizon
     system had remained in place and that there had not:been any further complaints
     about it from the Marine Drive branch and that the.Cash .Account showed no large
     losses. The Horizon system did crash Whilst Mrs Simpson was running the branch,
     but when she rebooted it, this did not effect the balance_ When Mrs Simpson had
     finished, Mr Booth was appointed as a temporary subpostmaster, and again, he
     had no problems-.


43. Mr Castleton stated that he had not taken any money and that he trusted his staff
     not to have taken anything. Mr Castleton said that he had 'asked for 10 pieces of
     information and I explained that I had only received his letter 2 working days prior
     to the interview and that I was working on obtaining this.


44. I checked that Mr . Castleton understood how the Cash Account worked with
     regards to balances and losses and gains and he confirmed he understood it_
     then went into detail with balances, error notices, losses etc and the evidence I
     had with the snapshots and declared cash. 1 provided all of this information to Mr
    Castleton, together with a list of the results of the balance.


45_ At the end o.f.each day the subpostmaster is supposed to count their cash, type
    the details into their computer stating the quantity of each denomination they
     have and then print a cash declaration to declare the quantity of cash in the tills
    overnight. (This is called the overnight cash declaration or ONCH). I referred Mr
    Castleton to some of the cash declarations which had been manually altered or
    written on. Specifically I referred him to 'week 47 (the Week ending 18 February
     2004) and also the declaration on 13 February 2004 which had a figure of
    approximately £7,000 written onto the bottom of the cash declaration.             Mr
    Castleton thought it was Mrs Trains writing, but she was -not sure.. I said this -was
    very important because although the Cash. Account for week 46 (the week ending
    11 February 2.004) showed a loss of £8,243.10, the snapshots and declared cash
    immediately following week 46 did not match. For example;


    (a)    The balance snapshot timed at 5.27p_m on 13 February -2004 (page 1$7.)
          showed that the Marine Drive branch should have needed £92,095.36 cash in

           5.30pm that day shows that the branch had cash of £99,128.40 (page 191),
           being £7,033.44 more than Horizon thought it had.


     (b) The balance snapshot timed at 11.59am 14 February 2004 showed that the
            Marine Drive branch should have needed £95,896.59 in its till to achieve a
           perfect balance page P1$91; i~ut the cash declaration "timed at 12.00pm that
           day showed that it actually had £102,706.10 (page 191), being £6,809.51

          that the Marine Drive branch should have needed   7,98.228 in its till to
           achieve a perfect balance (page 192), but the cash declaration timed at
           5.36pm that day showed that it had £84,909.54 (page 196), being £6,951.26
            more than Horizon thought it had:      , ~         6` b


     (d) The balance snapshot timed at 5.29pm dated Tuesday 17 February 2004
           showed that the Marine Drive branch needed £68,163.08 to achieve a perfect
            baianc   cpagel194), but the cash declaration also timed at 5.29pm that day
           showed that it actually had £74,939.85 (page 196), being £6„776.77 more
           than Horizon thought it had.            0
                                                       26'1

     In other words, according to the cash declarations, the Marine Drive branch had
     more cash than it required to balance.


45. Crucially, the Cash Account on Wednesday 18 February 2004 showed that the
      cash is an exact match for the cash required on the balance. I asked Mr Castleton
      where the surplus had gone. He had no explanation and stated that it was
     something to do with Horizon. I gave Mr Castleton other examples where there
      were shortages in subsequent weeks and that they did not match the snapshot in
     the cash declaration.


47. 1 explained to Mr Castleton that the Horizon system is a double entry accounting
      system and that everything I had checked worked through. The evidence does not
      support Mr Castleton's theory that the Horizon system went wrong when he
      entered the stock remittances on to the system.

Post interview


48. After the interview, I sent copies of the cash and Suspense .Accounts to Elizabeth
     Morgan and Davlyn Cumberland in Leeds who were two people very experienced
     in dealing with the Suspense Accounts. Neither ofthem could see anything wrong
     with the way that the computers were working.


49 On 14 May 2004, I wrote to, Mr Castleton to clarify the entrres..at the top of the
   final balance that he had queried and to explain why the 2 flnal'balances he had
     mentioned did not look similar (page 180).       i also sent him a copy of the
     interview notes.


Mr Castieton's dismissal


50. Mr Castleton did notprovide any evidence of a computer problem. Ail the entries
     in his Cash Accounts Were double checked_ The figure declared for cash on the
     system did not match the physical amount of cash he had in his office. This
     showed that there was an actual loss, rather than a computer problem. The audit
     had revealed that the Marine Drive branch was short of £25,758.75 cash, which,
     coupled with a lottery charge error that occurred on 23 March 200E for £1.76 that
     has not been repaid and a lottery claim error (a credit) that occurred in the cash
     account week ended 24 March 2004 for £75.80., made a total deficiency of
     £25,858.95.


51_ Mr Castleton. :denied taking the cash, but he would not take my advice to try
     individual balancing, or listen to my suggestion that a member of'his staff might
     be taking the money.


52. The Transaction Processing Department at Chesterfield and Girobank Piave stated
     that they had no outstanding error notices to issue. Fujitsu Services had checked
     the software and could not find any problems.


53. Since Mr Castleton had been suspended, the temporary subpostmasters had
     worked with exactly the same horizon kit and the balance had continued to be
     fine each day within expected parameters.       Mr Castleton had not given any
     credible explanation for the unauthorised _shortfalls.   In the circumstances, 1
     decided to terminate sumrnarlly Mr Castleton's Contract: I Wrote to Mr Castleton
     on 17 May 2004 to confirm that I had decided to terminate summarily the

      Contract effective from 23 March 2004, the date of his suspension (pages 181-
      162).

 gents foilswiug Mr Csstleton`s dismissal


54. On 23 May 2004, Mr Castleton wrote tome to confirm that he wished to appeal
      against my decision (page 183). He. also stated that he was seeking further
      information relating to the computer fault. On 1 June 2004 he wrote directly to.
      David Meitows-l=acer for this information (page 184).                       On 2 June 2004, David
      Mellows-Facer replied to Mr Castleton (page 185-186). Mr Castleton's appeal was
      dealt with by Mr John Jones, Area Development Manager, which upheld my
      decision.


55. In the circumstances, I believed (and still believe)'that my decision to dismiss Mr
      Castleton was entirely justified.




I believe that the facts stated in this fitness Statement are true.

                 Between Christmas and ew Year2003 approx.I was contacted by the Postmaster
                 Mr Lee Castleton.He told me thaton week 39 he had been £1,100.00 short in his cash
                 account.We discussed all the usual explanations i.e. Girobank errors,cheque deposits
                 going through as case .1 told him to contact Giroank and National savings to see if
                 there were any pro ms. also asked him ifhe was able to make the amount               ,as




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          good
                 a           error notice              to eight weeks to arrive.He;said that he could
                             Girobank




                                                                                                                                       may

                                                                                                                                                                                           up
                 make the amount good, and we left things at that.This had been the first time since
                 taking over the office in the previous July that he had any major problems balancing.

                 I visited the office on Friday 16th January 2004,in my normal visiting plan.Nothing
                 had yet come to light for the loss.The previous three weeks balances seemed fine.

            Mr Castleton then contacted me after his next balance he was over £4k short.Isaid to
            him to repeatthe process as before and contact Savings bank and(robank.I asked if
            the cash was kept secure and who has access to it, Mr Castleton would not hear ofany
            of his stafftaking the money.On this occasion he said that he was unable to make the
            amount good I told him to contact the helpline in order to get a hardship form We
            discussed at lengthways to double check all the work leaving the office and to
            perform a snap shot each evening and check the cash.

            I contacted him after the next balance he said he was a further £2500 short.Again we
            had a long discussion on the telephone as to how to check a!A the daily work,Again I
            brought up in conversation the possibility of someone taking the cash Lee discounted
            that in rather strong terms.I suggested individual stock unit balancing, and if he
            needed help setting this up I could help him.He didn't want to do this as lie felt the
            office didn't lend itself to doing this.

           The next week he was only £25 short so things seemed to have:settled down Until he
           balanced the week after and was £1500 short By now after just four       he was
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           weeks




           £ 8241.10 short, not counting the £1,100 he had made good to start with.

           I asked him if he had got hardship form                                                                                                                                                                                                                        no , so I said he must ring and

anything. He hadn't. He is convinced that since he had a processor changed around
about the time that the losses started it is that that is causing the losses.

I asked him to contact Horizon and get a system check.This was done and came back
fine.
I asked him to contact the helpline, which he did and he sent off some cash accounts
to look
            at.




I            him to contact TP to see if there were any error notices pending.
    asked




I visited the office on Friday 27`x' February 2004. We went over everything again Lee
was very distressed and angry, Chrissie his assistant was very worked up, upset and
angry. They felt that they hadn't received any help and had been left to try and prove
that the computer was changing the cash figures. At times they looked close to tears
and said that they weren't sleeping. On top of all this Lees son needed an operation
and was going into hospital. The stress levels in the office were high......

I asked them what else I could do to help. We had covered all the usual possibilities.
Lee and Chrissie kept on that they had not taken the money and that it must be the
Horizon kit. Lee said that the Horizon system helpline had said that the checks had
been ok, but what had they checked?
I told him to ring them back and ask.He said that they just told him everything was
ok.
Lee ;said that he thought that the two processors were not communicating with each
other and when he remmed in stock the system through the figures way out. I said
why not do your end of day snap shot , then rem in , then call a second snap shot, this
would then prove whether or not the system had changed anything.i said if the two
processors were not communicating then work done on the second machine would not
show up on the summary sheets.But all the P&A sheets and Girobank work was
agreeing.

The next week , Lee transferred the previous balance into the suspense account That
figure was now at £t1,752.78.He then showed a further shortage of £3512.26 on his
balance of 4.3.2004.This amount was not made good and the week after this rolled
amount escalated to £10,653.11.That would have been a true figure for the week of
£7140.85 short.

The following Wednesday the amount ( rolled again ) was £11,210.56, a true figure of
£557.45 short.

He was now showing £11,752.78 shortage in the suspense account and £ 11,210.56 on
the account for week 51(18.3.2004).

The audit was planned for the following Tuesday 23.3.2004.After the audit the total to
late account was £25,758.75.He had lost a further £ 2795.41 in that week.

I took Lee into the back office to speak to him.I told him that I couldn't let him go on
any more and as a precautionary measure was suspending him.1 talked to him about
what I would like to do with his permission. That was remove him and his staff from
the Post office and operate the office with a temp Pmr , to see how it would balance .I

           wanted to keep all the                   kit that they had been working with to try to keep




                                    Horizon
           everything else the same.

           Although Lee was distressed and Chrissie was very angry, they both wanted to be
           proved that..it was the computer. Lee even said he couldn't wait until the person was
           thousands short next week .He said then" heads will roll" for the distress that they
           have suffered.

           I asked a very experienced Postmaster if she would run the office on a temp. basis.
           This was Mrs Ruth Simpson from First lane Post Office in Hull. Ruth agreed , but
           was only able to run the branch for a few weeks as she had commitments of her own.
           I explained the situation and she came and took over at the audit. She opened for
           business on the Wednesday morning and balanced £2.14 short on the night. She
           brought with her a part time member of staff to help out on a Monday. At close of
           business that first Monday she was £100 short. Her explanation was that the part timer
           had left something in the stack and paid out this amount twice. Ruth did say that the
           girl had done that the past at her office.
                               in




           I telephoned Lee to get any reaction from him. He said that there were queues out of
           the door, customers were unhappy. He said that Ruth was only            one computer



                                                                                   using
           not         they had done , so it was not a true reflection of how they ran the office. He
               two




                     as




           said that she had mis-balanced as
                                                     well.




           I said I would speak to Ruth regarding his concerns. I contacted Ruth. I asked her to
           use both machines and we discussed the queues. She said that on a Monday she had
           two people working all day, so two machines were used. For the rest of the week she
           was on her own, but logged on to the system with two user names and had two
           machines running. She was serving from both machines, remming in on both , putting
           the lottery cash through on both.

      The next Wednesday she      £19+38 over. We talked every other day. She would
                                              was




      text me and let me know she was ok.

    The next balance she was £ 10.76 short.

  I visited the office on Friday l6 April 2004 l spoke to Lee away from the counter. I
  asked him how things were going. He was again distressed. He wanted to know what
was happening. We discussed Ruths balancing results. Ch ssie came into tie room ,
Lee was happy for her to stay. She wanted to know where the£10C shortage had gone
on Ruths first fall week. I explained what Ruth had thought. Chrissie made a
comment, like Ruth couldn'tbalance either Her maimer was very aggressive and
threatening. 1 said that I felt the balancing reflected any normal office. Again Lee and
         went on about the computer and that it was making the losses.
Chrissie




After about 30 rains of going round in circles I told Lee that Ruth would be finishing
on Wednesday 215` April due to her own cornrnitnents.7 said that I was not going to
let him back there as I wanted more time and more balance results.Lee said that lie

I spoke to Paul Whitaker from the investigations team again He said that they didn't
wish take on the case or interview the Prnr as he had kept me fully informed of the

      to
situation on a weekly basis. Again he said that they needed to prove dishonesty and
being able to prove this looked unlikely.

Mr Greg Booth took over as temp on Wednesday 21st April.

His first complete week ended on Wednesday 28"' April , he declared a gain of
£14.00.

I contacted Chesterfield again on the 29tt' April to see if there were any outstanding
error notices.There was an error for lottery that had yet to be investigated for
£125.00.An error for cheques that later cleared and did not generate an error
notice.There was also an error for an Easy access account that had been processed
incorrectly.

I contacted Giroba nk to see if there were any errors outstanding.I asked 'theme to look
back to week 43. He looked Lack to week 43 and came forward to week 02.There
was a small error of £1 43 , but that would not be reported,Everything else was fine.

Mr Franks l Lees father in law) contacted me on Friday 23Rd April , to discussed the
way in which Lee and his daughter Lisa had been treated.I explained the siniationn and
what I was trying to do.I told him that the suspension was a precaution Lind, I was
hoping that by having a temp Pmr in the office any problems with the comprter=
equipment would come to light .Mr Franks demanded that Lee be reinstated
immediately, he was very irate and wanted to take this higher.I gave him the 1CA
name, David Mellows-Facer, and told him that I would not be reinstating Lee at that
time.

Mr Franks spoke with David 'fellows-Facer and asked for a speedy conclusion to this
situation.

David spoke to me and asked if Lee could be brought to interview ASAP.I explained
to David that I would like to get a few more weeks of clear balancing at the office and
to ensure that there were no errors yet to come out of the system. David's thoughts
were that we had had five good balances and to get him
                                                          in.




I sent out an RTiJ letter to Lee inviting him to an interview on Monday 10`x' May 04.

He sent me a letter asking for information from Horizon and NBSC.I have made
every attempt to get this for him. I have used the staff in the area office and the
contracts manager to help me. The case was taken on by Richard Benton, problem
manager.

Lee then contacted me via the helpline on Tuesday Ott' May 2004, to say that he had
found £ 15k of the losses .I phoned him at the office to see where he had found the
cash.He said that the suspense account had doubled the figures.When he had put the
amounts into the suspense account, although the amount was showing in the suspense
account it was also still showing as a loss again the next week.Lee asked for the

this:The request was forwarded to Richard in the problem management section.

To see if the suspense account was having any effect on the balance I contacted my
temp Greg Booth.I asked him how he was balancing that week on his snap shots.He
told me that he was a few pounds over.It was now Wednesday 5 th May, balance
day.I told Greg what Lee had said about the suspense account.I asked Greg to put
£100 into the shortages line on the suspense account.First he ran a snap shot, then he
placed the £ 100 into the account, then he ran a second snap shot and a suspense
account report.During this time the second Horizon kit was still being used by the
assistant,The £100 was in the correct place and the cash figure on the snap shot had
changed by £100..11 was ok.I asked Greg to balance with those amounts still in the
account.] I e should balance .£100 over.l would then call on Friday and we would take
the amount out, to see if the opposite occurred.

Greg left me a.message on my phone later that evening to say that he had balanced.

the easy access error still showing.

Lee was sent a letter from the area office giving him the call log from NBSC, the e-
mail between Richard and Julie, the audit report.

I contacted him by phone on 6th May, to let him know that I had received his letter
and I was ,doing all I could to get him the information that he had requested.But I did
tell him that I probably would not be able to get all that he was asking for.

The NBSC contaeted.me to say that the request look into the suspense account.

he said that the requests had been sent io Fujitsu, but that it could take several weeks
before they would come back with an answer.

Monday 10th May 2004.RTU interview ( see notes).

At the interview Lee could only give one explanation for the losses at his office and
that was computer software problems. He did not provide any instances where the
figures on his cash accounts were incorrect, it was always the cash figure that didn't
match.He asked me to explain the discrepancies at the top of his final balances.

I sent copies to Liz Morgan and Davlynn Cumberland in Leeds, two very experienced
suspense account people. They helped me with the wording for my explanation. I sent
a letter to Lee on Friday l4`'' May, plus the interview notes,

Both Liz and Davlynn could not see anything wrong with the way the computers were
working.

I discussed the whole case with my HOA throughout.

My decision is to summaryterminate Lee Castletons contract for services.

 and felt that the mis-balances were due to a computer problem. He had been in
 contact with the Retail Line Manager Cath Oglesby and the Horizon help line
 regularly since the problems began. The fallowing table gives further weeks
 balance declarations on the cash account.

 Dear Mr Castleton
 Re: SUSPENSION OF CONTRACT FOR SERVICES


 I wrote to you on 23 March 2004 confirming the suspension of your
 contract for services as subpostmaster of Post Office® Marine Drive
 Branch.

 I     now considering the summary termination of your contract for
  am




 services on the grounds that the audit at your office on 23 March 2004
 resulted in a total shortage of £25,758.75. You had reported to me large,
 unexplained losses over the preceding period of 12 weeks. You were
 unable to make good the losses and therefore the decision was made to
suspend you from your contract for services due to the obvious risk to
Post Office Ltd funds. There are a number of obligations set out within
the Subpostmasters contract for services, one of which being retention of
the appointment is dependant on the branch being well managed and the
work performed properly to the satisfaction of Post Office Ltd, the
Subpostmasters contract section 1, paragraph 5 and section 12,
paragraph 12 refers. This is in accordance with Section 1, paragraph 10,
of your Contract For Services, which provides that the Agreement may be
determined at any time in case of breach of conditions by you, or non-
performance of your obligations or non-provision of Post Office services.

I would now like to aive you the opportunity to put forward any reasons
why I should not pursue this course of action. You can do this by
requesting a personal interview or submitting a response to the charge(s).
In either case     should inform me of your intentions, in writing by 5 May
              you

Cath,

I have asked both Sarah Pennington and Andrew Wise to provide a form of words and actions taken
whilst dealing with the PM at the above branch-:

 When I spoke to the PM at Marine Drive he was unsure what was causing these errors. He told me
 that he has been using the slave machine for his rems and I assured him that wouldn't cause a
problem as long as he was attached to the correct stock unit.
The PM thought there would be some errors relating to National Lottery, I phoned the Lottery team at
Transaction Processing who confirmed that there were some errors relating to Lottery, but for every
charge error there was a corresponding claim error, this was due to the lottery figures been entered on
Horizon in the wrong CAP.
PM was also concerned that when entering the lottery figures, it was as though the terminals were not
communicating, but if that was the case the PM would have large number of errors on every report
and product.
The PM sent cash account information to NBSC and it was looked at by Andrew Wise, he was unable
to find any errors. The only amount questioned was a large amount on the cheques to processing
centre which Andrew was able to confirm was a cheque payment for the purchase of Premium Bonds.
The PM was advised there was nothing more we could do and we suggested he works a manual
system at the side of Horizon to see if any problems were highlighted.
Also when doing the rems the PM should take a snapshot before and after to see if any problems
were occurring when doing a remittance.

Andrew Wise and I both feel that the Horizon system is working properly and we arc unable to help the
PM any further.

I hope this information helps, please contact me if you want to clarify anything.

Regards
Andrew

             cause a discrepancy) Cash declarations look ok, they usually use drawer id

            amounts apparently doubling on the cash flow report, and should be avoided.
            But again it will not cause a discrepancy. Checking the cash transactions
            on
            the system against the declarations shows that they are not working
            particularly accurately (i,e. at the end of the day the cash they declare
            in
            the drawer is tens, hundreds x- thousands of pounds astray from what has
            been recorded on the system). It is possible that they are       accurately

 MARINE DRIVE INTERVIEW 10 MAY 04

 Attendees: Mr Lee Castletou Subpostmaster
            Mrs Chrissie Train Post Office assistant
            Cath Oglesby RLM
           Lesley J Joyce CM

 Cath opened the interview by introducing everyone, explained the reasons for
 the interview, the roles of those in attendance, read out the charge and said it
 was LC's opportunity to give any explanations or reasons as to why his contract
 for services should not be terminated. (LC asked to tape the interview but was
 informed he could not but could take notes and be copied these notes)

 CO then went on to give a summary of events which led to the suspension of LC
 on 23 March 04 due to an unexplained shortage of £25,758.75.

During the 12 weeks prior to audit LC had several large unexplained losses. LC
was suspended as a precautionary measure to try and investigate where the
losses were occurring. CO asked LC if he would allow his premises to be used to
conduct PO services and he agreed.
LC's thoughts have always been that the Horizon system was to blame for the
shortages so the only thing that was changed in the office was the `people'. All
the current staff came out of the office and a temporary Postmaster, Ruth
Simpson, was allowed to run the branch, during the 4 weeks that RS was in place
the cash accounts showed no large losses.
The system did crash on her and was re-booted but this did not affect the
balance. She had problems with the AP card reader but was not allowed to
change the kit under the circumstances. No problems occurred while remming in
or with Lottery.
When RS finished Greg was appointed as temp Postmaster, again no problems
with balances or with any of the above,

CO Went on to discuss actions she had taken:--
Horizon-Asked for a system check twice
1-During the time of large losses----everything okay
2-During RS time
3-Asked what upgrades had there been since week 39, the HSH said upgrades
happened all the time, to different offices and they were unable look at
individual offices.
4-All the events on the software system checked back to 1 March 04, no
abnormalities.

Chesterfield
1-Contacted them on a number of occasions regarding any outstanding error
notices
APS-None up to week 3

 CO.Said it varied for different office's but £20 per week.was reasonable.CO
 opened the discussion to LC to give reasonsfor the losses.
 LC Said that he had not taken any money and that he trusted his staff 100% not to
 have taken anything.. He said that he had asked for 10 bits of information in the letter
                                                                         ,
 he sent but only received I item. He had asked Fujitzu for help and the NBSC and no
 one had got back to him, they were not prepared to help He had spent hours each
 night with CT looking ar the balances. He said that a remote test would not turn on




                                                                                                      up
 a software check, he understood -there were a lot of problems with Horizon and the
 system, he had a tot of problems at the office with re-boots     so why did this




                                                             etc,
 happen.if nothing was wrong with the system. No one would tell him what tests were
 done, I don't know what `clear desktop' means. I have had a lot of a-mails from
 Postmasters who have problems with Horizon.

  CO Replied that she had only received his letter on the :light of wed 5* May
  which was only 2 working days prior to the interview and she was working on
  getting him the information be regeeste . She had suggested several things




                                                                                                    for
  him to do In the office such as individual balances and the idea that staff could be
  responsible but he would not take any measures or listen to this point of view.
  CO, then said it would be helpful to go through the individual balances, week by
 week methodically and look at the suspense accounts. CO clarified LC
 understanding of how the cash account worked with regards to balances




                                                                                    and
 losses and gains. LC Confirmed he understood.
 CO Then          into detail with balances, error notices, losses etc and the evidence
           goes




 she has with snapshots and declared cash. (Copies of all this information is
 provided with a list of all the results of the balance)
 CO Asked LC to clarify ifhe made the error notices good but he could not
 remember. She clarified when the shortages were first put in the c/a. COstated
 that not all the information such as snapshots were provided and LC said they
 were probably in the box.
 CO refers LC to          of the cash declarations which have been manually
                                                                                          altered
                  some




 or written on, specifically to week 47 and the declaration on 12 Feb 04 which had
 a figure of aprox £7000 written on the bottom of the cash declaration. Both LC
 and CT looked but although LC said he thought it was CT writing she was not
 certain. CO said this was very important as although the c/a for week 46 showed
a loss of £8243.10 the following snapshots and declared cash did not evidence
this. She explains:-
Snapshot at 17.27 on Fri 13 Feb shows you need £92095.36, cash declaration
shows you have £99128.40, a gain of £7033.44.
Sat 14 Feb shows you need £95896.59, cash declaration shows you have
£102706.10, a gain of £6809.51.
Mon 16 Feb snapshot shows you need £77958.28, cash declarations show
                                                                              you




have £8490954, a gain of £6951.26
Tuesday 17 Feb snapshot shows you need £68163.08, cash declaration shows you
have _184909.54, a gain of £6776.77
HOWEVER The                wed shows the cash         exact match for the cash
                     c/a




                           on




                                                  is

 LC Has no explanation and says it must be something to do with Horizon.
 CO Goes on to give other examples where shortages in subsequent weeks do not
 then match the snapshot and declaration. (Evidence provided)
 CO and LC then have a long discussion about the discrepancies shown on the
 snapshot and CO says she will clarify after interview.
 CO asks again where the gains_which are evident and which are hand written on
 the cash declaration could have gone.

 LC says he does not know but he has not taken the money.

 CO Says that the Horizon system works as a double entry system and everything
 she has looked at works through. Originally LC had said that the system was
 doing something when the rems were put through but the evidence does not
 shows this. She had asked LC to run a snapshot after close of business, input the
 rem and then run another snapshot to see if figures were altered and asks LC if
 he had done this.

LC Says that he did not have time to do this, it had been a nightmare, he feels it is a
computer problem and no-one has helped him. 5 months is a Iong time to try and
remember what happened and what went on. He mentions other offices that have told
him about problems with cheque listings and F&A dockets. He said that no-one had
visited from Horizon to look at his problems and balances.

CO Explained that Horizon would not attend his office due to poor balances,
they would need evidence of a problem which be was unable to provide, she also
mentioned that she had given him advice and spent hours and hours on this case
and his cash accounts. She asked LC if he could show her a figure that the
Horizon system had changed which did not make sense or could prove his
allegations.


LC Said no but he did know an office where it had changed a figure on Girobank
although the office did receive corresponding error notices.

CO asked LC to confirm he had not taken the money

LC No. He asks see the c/a's for weeks 1,2,3,4 which CO provides to him and says
                to




he can have copies.

CO asks if there is anything else he wants to add.

LC says he would like the explanation on the discrepancies, which CO agrees to
provide.
CO told LC that she was still waiting for a response from Horizon regarding the
checks on the software.As soon as they were available she would let him know
the out come.
CO Ends the interview by thanking those in attendance.

             Re.: Entries at           of Final Balance
                                 top




              I am writing to clarify the entries at the top of the final balance. The




                                                                                     final
             balance shows the discrepancies in that balance period. During the week,
             if snap shots are taken then the NET discrepancy is brought forward from
             the previous week. If you look back to when the office was balancing you
             will see that the NET loss or gain flows through into the next week, until a
             final balance is produced. The final balance shows the discrepancies l-or
             that cash account week.

             Transferring an amount into to le 2a in the suspense account means that
             the system they puts the loss to one side and you continue with a straight
             balance.

               n the first week that you trinsr`errr d the loss beao the suspense accouiii,
             the previous weeks Net loss flowed through,          wo,, Id be    if
                                                                          seen

             snapshots were taken.. Then when a final baisnce is produced the
             discrepancies are shown for that week. You produced a perfect balance
             e.g. no loss or gain, V erefore the net discrepancy was nil.

             On the week that you transfe-red the second amount into the suspense
             account, you had a further loss so the net discrepancy was this further
             loss. That is     the two fna" balances don't look similar.

            17.05.04

             Dear Lee




            ! am writing following our meeting on Monday 10 May 2004, in which you
            put forward reasons why your contract for services should not be
            summarily terminated -

            I have reviewed the papers relating to this case very carefully and have
            taken into account the points you have put forward..

            After consideration I have decided to summarily terminate your contract for
            services as Subpostmaster of Post Office® Marine Drive branch from the
            date of your suspension, 23 March 2004, on the grounds that you have
            had several large unexplained losses at your office totalling £25,758.75.
            You were unable to make the losses good, which is in breach of your
            Contract For Services. There are a number of obligations set out within the
            Subpostmasters contract for services, one of which is that the branch is
            well managed and the work performed to the satisfaction of Post Office
            Ltd. I do not feel that you have achieved your obligations.

            Please refer to your contract for services section 1, paragraphs 5 and 10
            and section 12, paragraph 12.

            You may, it you wish, appeal against my decision. If it your intention to
                                                                   is




            appeal, you should notify me, in writing by 31 May 2004. The format of the
            appeal can either be a personal interview or written submission. Should
            you wish to progress this avenue, I will arrange for the appeal to be heard
            by a member of Post Office Ltd Appeals Authority.
