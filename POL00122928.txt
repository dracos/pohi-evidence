Subject: RE: PCI Audit

Attachment: Security Investigations Data Handling Process v1 0.doc.
Rob / Dave,

I have attached the ARQ process written by Moyn. The PCI audit in the main was dealing with the storage of Credit
Card information. We explained from the beginning we rarely had that info in our data.

The concerns focused on the data / discs, how they are distributed, where they are stored and when / how they are
destroyed. A robust audit trail.

The audit was conducted in Bolton. I do not know the results.

I don’t recall anything about Investigators requesting discs for other people. As I say my involvement was merely to
add the Investigator’s use of ARQ discs.

Christopher Knight I Security Manager

Hi Rob,

It was Chris Knight and Dave Pardoe who was involved on the day of the audit not myself so I am not sure what was
discussed and I have not seen any process come from this.

Andrew,

To avoid confusion, and to seek clarification, could you advise what was agreed at the recent PCI audit and is there a
memo or guide outlining who should be doing what ie Case File management/Security Managers. I understand a date
has been set for the Case file management workshop; any ambiguity in respect of this or other issues can be sorted
then.

Regards

Rob

Rob/Dave,

I believe the PCI audit was conducted recently and one possibility moving forwards is that any external
requests for Fujitsu data must come through an Investigator ... and the Investigator engages with the
requestor, assesses the request, submits the request, receives the data, supplies it to the requestor, etc..

Not sure if I’m getting the wrong end of the stick here, but if this is the case then I must say I do not agree
with it. Whilst it may provide a better audit trail and probity for PCI purposes, I really don’t think
Investigators should be embroiled in this process ... it will create more work (especially in view of unfilled
vacancies), isn’t part of their usual remit and is/has traditionally been a Casework Team responsibility.
Unless things have changed, the Casework Team also manage the Fujitsu contract and relationship within
Security (i.e. we have a quota of data requests per year, a quota of witness statements, and a quota of
court attendance). It seems like an additional middle-man approach may be being considered here.

For info, I get still requests from LEAs and others (as do probably others in the team) and supply them with
the associated contacts in Casework and indicate they should submit a DPA request.

Apologies if I’m wrong in my understanding, but I wanted to raise my views before anything was set in
stone.

Dave Posnett I Accredited Financial Investigator
