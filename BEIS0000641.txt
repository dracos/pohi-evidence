Apologies but taking a couple of days out on a/I to allow the team to settle and have some space a bit as I’m conscious
I’m pushing them on all fronts now! Back Tuesday so happy to pick up with Eleanor then.

It’s not about any work being delayed, it’s more about the right place to update Sir Wyn on progress.

Speak Tuesday.

Thank you for letting us know. It’s probably worth us talking through, I assume we have our Friday catch up
tomorrow? As I wouldn’t want the delivery of this work delayed because of potential Inquiry criticism risks. And I
wonder about (if I have my sports analogy correct), doesn’t doing this first put you into an offensive position, rather
than defensive? Especially as Hudgell is beginning to start his attack in that space via his open letter? We think you
could present this well, and it may allay fears, and it’s fears that can create parliamentary noise.
Thanks

With apologies and letting you know as soon as I could but I and Post Office need to be excused from this meeting
please.

On reflection and with advice, if I did attend to deliver the messages I needed to get across on the 14" March it would
probably be inappropriate given the imminent compensation hearing at the Inquiry in April. This is what I have
reflected on and the timing is just not great — we can not afford something however small to come out of the meeting
before advising the Inquiry.

On that basis, with apologies again, Post Office need to be excused please.

I’m also sorry for the additional work this has and may cause you now around the logistics and the false dawn.

Happy to elaborate further if required.

Post April compensation Inquiry day I will reflect further and it may be more appropriate to re-engage then.

Many thanks.

Regards

Simon

Hi Kenneth, Simon,
Thanks for coming back on this.
The proposed topics sound sensible, thanks Simon. In terms of attendees, I agree 6 may seem too many — perhaps
taking this down to 4 would be better received by the group. As Eleanor has mentioned, we expect that the Minister
will introduce you/your agenda items — this may influence whether Nick wants to attend or not.
A couple of points:
* Weare expecting to have 30 minutes on the agenda for OHC.
* We will provide a written summary table of progress across all schemes so a verbal update is likely not
required (example attached) though we may have a ‘general update’ in which the ask re: HSS late apps can be
included.
* Please see attached the slides Rob Brightwell has previously used for presenting the GLO to the group — this
format has been well received by the group before in case this is useful for preparing slides (if you intend to use
some) in your own POL templates.
* Please see attached bios of the attendees from last time.
* Please see below a list of topics which have been previously raised in the meetings.
¢ Please see below draft text for the invite.
* Copying @Brightwell, Rob (Business Sectors - Services Directorate) — in case you have any views on Simon’s
point below regarding GLO (highlighted in yellow)

Topics raised in past meetings:
* Bankruptcies
* Issues of trust (in POL, in Govt)
* How is Sir Wyn being engaged in the design of compensation delivery?
© Fujitsu — their role/future contracts
* HSS - Publicity on late applicants; contacting those who have died - how will their estate claim?; closure date
* OHC - How many cases pending with CCRC

Draft text for invite:

I hope you found the meeting in November to discuss our plans for delivering GLO compensation useful. I am
planning the next meeting on Horizon compensation for 14 March. I hope you will be able to attend. At this meeting,
we will provide an update on GLO compensation. Post Office’s Historical Matters Director [and CEO- tbc] will also be
joining the meeting to update you on delivery of compensation to those with overturned convictions, including
current appeal rates and efforts to contact postmasters with historical convictions, and upcoming adjustments to the
delivery model.

Many thanks,

Emily

Not sure how long we will get and assume Emily will let us know but in terms of items to cover from a Post Office
perspective:
* Adopting a postmaster centric remediation approach on the OHC cases
* Encouraging them to encourage people to come forward in the OHC space as the start of the journey to
explain the difference between the 84 and the 705
* Encourage them to encourage people to enter into the HSS late application scheme give the level of take up
beyond the initial cohort
© If time allows an update of where we are with each of the Post Office schemes

is consistent with the HSS and I the risks associated if it is not —
ill be guided i if to raise such an issue an if so
f having to re-open cases and the Inquiry oversight if

the GLO does not generate similar outcomes to Post Office.
After consultation with Ben F, we think Nick should probably be included please given the Ministers attendance so
does that mean a Post Office entourage of Nick, Richard, Neil, Nicola, Diane and myself? Too many? Feels like it so we
might have to drop the lawyers.

Hope this helps to shape things and this along with information from Emily helps to anticipate the angles they will be
interested in for the briefing. For the remediation approach I would very much encourage you to speak to Neil (on
copy) for a few choice lines.

I would also be grateful if you could work with Philippa re Nick’s diary for the 14". To be clear Nick has sent he is not
precious so if he doesn’t want to attend no problem and there might be a good reason for it. Just don’t want him not
to be there when there is an expectation — you/Richard will probably be better to advise him than I.

Regards

Hi Kenneth,
Thanks for your message, hope you are well too. Please see answers below.

« Who is attending from the department? TBC but likely Carl, Beth/Eleanor.
« What MPs/ peers are being invited? Invites still TBC but last time, this is who was invited:

Lord Arbuthnot of Edrom

Andrew Bridgen MP

Kevan Jones MP.

Kate Osborne MP.

Karl Turner MP

Marion Fellows MP

Lucy Allen MP
Siobhan Baillie MP
« What specific topics are you wanting to cover? Could you please confirm to me (ideally by
tomorrow) whether you’d be happy to cover:

1. Potential future overturns/triage work (I believe Simon has discussed this previously with Rob

B/Beth/Eleanor)
2. OHC Delivery and remediation changes
« Has an invite gone to MPs and can we see that please? Not yet sent but I will send over some draft
text to you before it goes and then confirm when it has (the text will be subject to your confirmation
that you are content with the above 2 agenda items).
¢ Is the meeting confidential? We usually take an approach to assume that anything discussed has
the potential to become public, so using lines you’d be comfortable to use in public would be sensible.
In past meetings, however, Chatham House rules have been used and we could propose this again if
appropriate.
« Where will the meeting take place — online or in person? We're hoping for in-person — just need to
work out logistics.

I’ve set up a meeting on 2 March to discuss approach and objectives, would it be useful for you to attend? If you’re
planning to prepare slides for presentation, it would be useful to give Carl sight of these so could you share say the
week before the meeting if so?

I can also look at sending through some background on the attendees/topics they’ve raised in past meetings if useful.
Many thanks,

Hi Simon, Neil,

I hope you are well.

Just following up on the ask that you come along at some point to engage with Parliamentarians on OHC delivery and
to engage them on the changes to a remediation style. There is a meeting between the Minister and interested
Parliamentarians pencilled in for Tuesday 14 March and we think it would be good to get you in on the same forum
after the Minister is done with other business. Time is TBC though let me know if you’d envisage a problem with this
date.

Happy to set up a call early on to discuss approach and I will set up a pre-meet beforehand in any case.

Let me know if any questions on that.

Many thanks,

Emily
