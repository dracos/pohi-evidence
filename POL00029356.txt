Usually the MSU would have raised calls on this FAD since it appeared in 2 IncompleteSummaries and Harvester Exception reports
lated 15/05/09 and 16/05/09. But since this was not done, this problem was not investigated and the exceptions are still sitting
lin the TRT waiting to be actioned.

[these exceptions are related to bureau txns done on 15/05/09 15:59 Mode:SC £12079.46 worth of Euros (which is missing a
settlement line) and a Mode;ER done on 16/05/09 14:30 (which has a cash settlement line). This gave the PM when SU:BDC eventually
rolled into TP(2,2) on 20/05/09 a gain of £12079.71 and a payments and receipts difference of £12079.46.

It thought this might be a quick and easy call but it turned out not to be so since I am on leave next week I am routing this call
to Anne who has dealt with a similar problem PC0175821 (KEL obengc3120K). Sorry, Anne - however unlike PCO175821, nothing has
been done on the TRT and the MSU/POL/PM have not been informed so you are starting with a clean slate.

[this may need a correction written on the counter, with POL's approval. Or possibly correcting the POLFS feed in such a way that
they can issue a TC? Still thinking about it. Spoke to PM and explained what had happened (they scanned a set of pouches in
reversal too quickly). Next TP rollover is 10th June. PM happy that cause is known and action will be taken.

subject: PC0181609: Branch 384238 Receipts and Payments mismatch

claire,

As discussed - please send on (with attachment) to Mark Wardle via =
sims.

Branch 384238 (Hanley WHS) had a problem on Friday 15th May, when two -
Jturrency pouches were reversed very close together. As a result, one ~
jral formed Serve Customer transaction was written, for 13500 Euros. The =
value was £12079.46. There was no corresponding settlement line hence =
the session did not net to zero. The following day, the branch reversed =
the transaction, and the reversal settled automatically to cash.

In this case we propose to resolve the effects of the problem by making =
la correction to the data feed to POLFS at the data centre. This leaves =
the branch with a large gain (due solely to the system problem) which =
they Assign to Nominee, but on POLFS the Assigned gain will be negated =
lby our correction, hence centrally the figures are correct.

At the branch

The branch currency holding is correct, because the transaction was =
reversed, but has caused a gain of £12079.46 (because the reversal
settled to cash whereas the original transaction had no settlement
hatsoever). The branch has since rolled the BDC stock unit into a new =
balance period, accepting a gain of £12079.71 which includes a genuine =
lain of 25p. The balance report shows a difference between Receipts and =
Payments of £12079.46.

I have spoken to the Branch Manager and explained that there has been a ~
system problem, caused by rapidly scanning currency pouches when
jreversing them. The next branch TP rollover is scheduled for 10th June.

We suggest that they continue as normal i.e. move the gain to Local
suspense when the stock unit is rolled into the next TP on 10th June,
then clear Local Suspense using Assign to Nominee. This is their normal =
jorocess. It is important that they realise that any discrepancies apart ~
from the £12079.46 caused by this problem must be investigated and
resolved in the usual fashion. Any residual gain / loss can be Assigned
to Nominee as normal. Their Branch Trading Statement will show a Trading
Position of £12079.46 (normally zero).

I have not discussed this with the manager.

I have successfully completed a TP rollover for the branch on a test =
system to confirm that the expected messages are generated and there are
Ino unexpected side-effects.

Data to be sent to POLFS
Since there are unharvested transactions for 15th and 16th May, nothing =
from the branch for those days has yet been sent to POLIS.
Also, the data can only be sent if it nets to zero. This will not be =
the case for 15th May where the settlement line was missing. We will =
Inced to make a correction centrally so it nets to zero, otherwise it =
cannot be sent.

The malformed SC and ER transactions will be repaired sufficiently to =
Ibe sent to POLMIS and POLFS.

An extra entry will be added to the POLFS data for 15th May:
Article NAQ0000017 account 531100 (Agents Debt in Customer Accounts) =
value -£12079.46.

This will
(a) cause the transactions for 15th May to net to zero and thus be sent =
Ito POLFS
(b) negate the entry generated at the branch for account 531100 when =
they complete their TP rollover on 10th June.

(Additional clarification:

Currently TPS_POL FS Summaries Incomp shows 15-May-2009 £0.00, =
H6-May-2009 £12,079.46.

Unharvested transaction values are 15-May-2009 £12,079.46, 16th May =
12,079.46

So once repaired via the TIP repair tool, TPS_POL FS Summaries Incomp =
11 show 15-May-2009 £12,079.46, 16-May-2009 £0.00

Data for 16th May will be sent immediately because no longer any =
jnarvester exception and nets to zero. Correction of ~£12,079.46 will
be applied, by adding a new row to the TPS POL FS Summaries Incomp table =
for 15th May, using the Assign to Nominee account. )

POL00029356
POL00029356

Action by Post Office Ltd

Post Office may want to handle further communication with the branch ~
regarding the next rollover (see above).

The branch reports will show a gain, Assigned to Nominee, which does
Inct exist on POLFS. No further action should be required on POLFS long =
term, but between when the correction is made and llth June, there will =
be a negative gain of £12079.46 in account 531100.

The correction needs to be made at the data centre as soon as possible,
since no data for 15/16 May has yet been sent to POLFS for this branch. =
can Post Office confirm that they are happy for us to make this =
correction to the POLFS feed, and let us know if they will be contacting ~
the branch or whether we should do so.

The attached spreadsheet shows the messages and accounts involved. I'm =
appy to try to answer any further questions.

Anne.

lthe data for 16th May was sent to POLFS in file IF20090601065.BLE.

[the branch now has an entry on the Incomplete Summaries report for 15th May (because the correction means that day no longer nets

le has rolled over all the stock units but there was a bit of confusion and local suspense was initially cleared to cash. PM
repeated the SU balance and this time cleared LS using Assign to Nominee. So on the balance report the amount transferred to and
from suspense is twice what was expected. But overall everything is correct, and a gain of £11827.48 was assigned to nominee. The
lexpected gain caused by the system problem was £12079.46, so in fact the branch seems to have had a loss of £151.98 in TP 2.

fice rollover not done yet. I phoned to reassure them that all looks ok, PM not available until 10:15.

Yesterday I rewrote the Sessions object for user SWI001, changing the State from Active to Ended. Counter 5 was unusable and the
ser couldn't be detached from the stock unit. Nothing to do with the original problem, but was preventing SU BB balance, and
Inence the office balance from being completed.

fall stock units and the office have now rolled over and the outcome is as predicted. Everything should now be consistent at the
ranch and on POL FS. PM appreciated the help given and is happy to close the call.
