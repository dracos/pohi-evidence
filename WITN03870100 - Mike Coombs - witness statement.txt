POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF MICHAEL JOHN BARTON COOMBS

1, MR MICHAEL JOHN BARTON COOMBS, will say as follows:
INTRODUCTION
1. lam currently retired, and have been since June 2002. My retirement followed
a period of medical leave from work that commenced in April 2001. | was
formerly employed by the International Computers Limited (“ICL”) group. My
last professional role was as Programme Director of the Horizon project (the
“Programme’) at ICL Pathway Limited (“ICL Pathway”), a position that | held
between around September 1997 and April 2001. | am not involved in the

Programme at present, and have had no involvement in it since April 2001.

2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
“Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request provided to me on 8
June 2022 and the supplementary questions provided to me on 2 September

2022 (the “Request”. It is based on my direct knowledge of relevant matters.

Page 1 of 23
The topics set out in the Inquiry’s Request relate to events that took place more
than 21 years ago. | have tried to remember them as best as | can. However,
the length of time that has passed since the relevant events, compounded by
my ongoing health difficulties (about which | provide further detail below), make

it difficult for me to recall the relevant events completely or accurately.

In this statement, | have addressed, in particular, my involvement in the
Programme up to and including the rollout of New Release 2, and my general

reflections on the Programme.

| also address my current and previous health issues, in particular at
paragraphs 11 to 15, as these have impacted my recollections and this

statement.

The Inquiry has referred me to a number of documents in the Request. Where
these documents are relevant to my recollections or have assisted me in my
recollections, | have referred to them below using references WITN0387_01/1
to WITN0387_01/23. The documents are also listed in the index accompanying

this statement.

BACKGROUND

7.

| completed an engineering degree at the University of Leicester in the summer
of 1969. In October 1969, | joined the ICL group in a graduate role. | remained

employed by the ICL group for the remainder of my career.

During the course of my career, | worked on a range of IT projects including
internal ICL projects and computerisation projects for public bodies. While | had

an engineering degree, | did not work in technical roles at ICL. Throughout my

Page 2 of 23

WITN03870100
WITN03870100
10.

career, | was involved in the management side of projects rather than the

technical side.

| initially became involved in the Programme in 1995, during the bid phase. At
the time, | was working in ICL’s development division in Manchester, which was
not involved with the Horizon bid. However, as | had previous experience on a
similar computerisation project for the UK Inland Revenue (as it was then
known), | was asked to consult with the bid team as they prepared the Horizon
bid. My role was discrete, and included consulting on specific queries raised by
the bid team and potentially drafting certain aspects of the bid document. For
example, | recall assisting with aspects relating to the rollout of terminals to
Post Office branches (as | had experience with a similar process on the
previous project for the Inland Revenue). | recall working with John Bennett
and Liam Foley, as well as others whose names | do not remember. | do not
recall any further details of the assistance | provided. Following the success of

the Horizon bid, | did not remain involved in the Programme.

Around the spring of 1997, while | was based in Manchester and working on a
project unrelated to Horizon, | was asked to lead a review of the Programme
by John Bennett, who was the Managing Director of ICL Pathway at the time,
and Keith Todd, who was the Managing Director of the ICL group. | recall there
were concerns about the progress of the Programme and an independent
review was thought to be necessary. Specifically, | believe the Programme was
experiencing difficulties baselining the Horizon software and so progress was
slower than it should have been. This also meant the release was not coming

together to enable testing on time. | led a review, as requested, and recall

finding that there was considerable slip in the Programme timeline and that
there were various organisational issues. | do not, however, remember the
details of my findings. | remember presenting my findings to ICL Pathway
management and representatives of the customers around September 1997.
Following this presentation, | was asked to join the Programme as Programme

Director to address the issues.

Around March or April 1999, | suffered an atrial fibrillation incident. As a result
of this incident, | was hospitalised for around ten days. After being discharged
from hospital, | remained on medical leave from work until around June 1999.
When | returned to work, | was initially placed on lighter duties for several
months and | was also deliberately trying to pace myself to avoid particularly
stressful situations. As a result, | am not able to assist the Inquiry in relation to
events that took place while | was away from work, and there may, generally,

be some gaps in my memory in relation to events in 1999.

12. On6 April 2001, | suffered a major stroke. As a result, | was admitted to hospital

for about 6 weeks. This stroke had significant repercussions for my physical,
mental and emotional health. In particular, it caused a number of serious

conditions, including the following, which continue to affect me today:

12.1. Memory loss, including an inability to recall almost anything that

occurred for several months prior to the stroke.

12.2. Difficulties with speech and communication

Page 4 of 23

WITN03870100
WITN03870100
WITN03870100
WITN03870100

13. As aresult of this stroke, and the conditions it caused, | came to the conclusion
that | would not be able to return to work, and took an early retirement in June

2002.

14. In 2008, | suffered a second stroke. As a result, | was admitted to hospital for
about 4 days. The effects of this stroke were relatively minor compared to the

one | suffered in April 2001.

15. While there have been improvements to my health since my first stroke in 2001,
my memory remains limited. | struggle to recall events that took place a long
time ago. | also have difficulties with my short term memory and, at times, can
struggle to recall events that took place very recently. Where | am able to recall
events or occurrences, my memories may be general, incomplete, or not
entirely accurate. While the Inquiry has referred me to various documents in
the Request, and on occasion these have assisted my memory, | often do not

recall the specific matters or incidents mentioned in these documents.

16. Notwithstanding these difficulties, | have tried my best to recall relevant events
from my involvement in the Programme that are responsive to the Inquiry’s

questions, as contained in the Request.

MY ROLE AS HORIZON PROGRAMME DIRECTOR

17. My role as Programme Director was to take a cross-programme or matrix view
of the programme elements of the Programme. For example, | tracked issues
as they arose in the technical teams and then worked with those teams to
identify the right actions to resolve them. | was also involved in governance,
which included setting up organisational structures for the Programme such as

committees or forums and attending those meetings.

Page 5 of 23
WITN03870100
WITN03870100

18. Having reviewed the letter to Peter Crahan from Dave Miller dated 30 June
1998 (WITN0387_01/1), | recall attending the Horizon Programme Board and,
depending on the topics to be discussed and their relevance to me, the Horizon
Delivery Group. | also recall being involved in setting up the forum referred to
at paragraph 4.7 of the document. The purpose of this forum was to bring
together people working on both the programme and the commercials to deal
with those issues. One of the challenges | encountered on the Programme was
commercial issues often bumping into programme issues. While | do not recall
the specific issues that arose, the matters set out in the letter to Dave Miller
from Tony Oppenheim dated 18 September 1998 (WITN0387_01/2) are

familiar and are likely to represent the issues at the time.

19. My role did not require me to have a detailed knowledge of the technical
aspects of the Horizon system (such as software development or testing). My
role was primarily a project management one, which was consistent with my

previous experience at ICL (as noted at paragraph 8 above).

20. As Programme Director, my role was quite autonomous. | generally reported to
John Bennett. | also had occasional communication with Keith Todd. Post
Office Counters Limited (“POCL”) also put in place someone to carry out a
similar role to me. This was Dave Miller, who was, effectively, my POCL

counterpart.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAMME
21. My recollection of the risks has been somewhat assisted by reviewing the letter

from Bruce McNiven to myself dated 21 May 1998 (WITN0387_01/3) and the

Page 6 of 23
Horizon Programme Board Report dated 16 June 1998 (WITN0387_01/4)

(Annex D, in particular). | recall a number of risks to the Programme:

21.1. Delivering the Programme to schedule. During and prior to the rollout of

New Release 2, there were challenges delivering the Programme on
time. In general on the Programme, there was a lot of work to be done

and the timescales were usually very tight.

21.2. Training of subpostmasters to use the system. | recall a lot of concern

around how subpostmasters would be trained to use the system
effectively, and that this might be a risk for rollout and the success of
the Programme. My recollection is that John Dicks had responsibility
for defining training. There was discussion around whether ICL should
directly train end-users or whether it would train “trainers” who would
subsequently train the end-users. Both these options had different
dynamics in terms of resourcing and staffing, but | believe it was
concluded that ICL Pathway should train the trainers, as this would
better meet the volume of training required. There was also concern
around the ability of subpostmasters to use new technology, as many

of them were older and not used to working with IT.

21.3. The role of the Benefits Agency (“BA”). | recall there being a concern

that BA was not fully committed to the Programme. In particular, while
work on New Release 2 was ongoing, BA was finalising their CAPS
programme and wanted fewer updates in each release of Horizon. This
had had a direct impact on ICL Pathway as it meant an increased

number of releases.

RESOURCING OF THE PROGRAMME

22.

23.

24.

25.

26.

While | was Programme Director, | thought the Programme was generally

appropriately resourced.

As Programme Director, | used to sponsor requests to the Change Control
Board, and these included resource related requests. While | do not recall any
specific request, such requests were not generally turned down. My impression
was that ICL Pathway was prepared to spend the necessary money, including

to recruit the right people, where necessary to advance the Programme.

In terms of expertise, | recall that a large number of those working on the
Programme (including myself) were drawn from the previous computerisation
project for the Inland Revenue (which was regarded as a success at the time).
ICL Pathway was pulling people from previous similar projects into the
Programme for their expertise. However, | should clarify that | was not directly
involved in most recruitment. The directors of each team would have been

responsible for their own staff, with support from the personnel department.

| do recall there were times where there were resourcing shortfalls — for
instance when we had difficulties recruiting sufficient staff, which is mentioned
at paragraph 4.5 of the Monthly Progress Report for June 1997
(WITN0387_01/5). However, | do not recall this being a consistent issue and,
in my experience, it is to be expected that a project will not always be fully

resourced at all times.

| have specifically considered the Report on Release 2 Process Improvement
Programme (WITN0387_01/6), which reports on improvements to be made to

the deployment of processes/standards and compliance with them by the

Page 8 of 23

WITN03870100
WITN03870100
Programme team, in response to a report by PA Consulting. While | expect
there would have been non-compliance with standards, and this was correctly
being addressed, this document has not assisted me in recalling issues with

resourcing at the time.

ISSUES IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF SOFTWARE, AND DELAYS

TO THE PROGRAMME IN 1997 TO 1998

27.

28.

As | noted above at paragraphs 8 and 17, my role on the Programme did not
require me to know details about the technical issues that had arisen in
software development or testing. | provided a cross-programme or matrix view
of the programme elements of the Programme. In light of this, | am not able to
recall the specific issues that arose during software development and testing. |
generally recall attending meetings where | may have discussed, at an
aggregate level, the number of open PinICLs or Known Problem Register
entries at the time, and their impact on meeting Programme targets. However,
| would not generally have been aware of the specific technical issue that was

causing the problem raised by a given PinlCL.

| note, for instance, that the BA/POCL Programme Delivery Authority Board
Minutes dated 23 September 1997 (WITN0387_01/7) indicate that there were
a significant number of open Category 1 PinlCLs relating to security,
accounting and reconciliation, and the BA/POCL Programme Delivery
Authority Board Minutes dated 21 August 1997 (WITN0387_01/8) also refers
to security issues. While | do not recall all the categories of PinICLs, | do recall
that category 1 PinICLs were the most serious. However, | am unable to recall

the specific issues these documents relate to.

WITN03870100
29.

30.

Version 1 of the 100 Trial Surveys Report (“Trial Surveys Report’)
(WITN0387_01/9) assisted me to recall that there were initially issues with the
rollout of hardware to Post Office branches, because the installation of new
hardware sometimes required subpostmasters to reorganise their counters or
ways of working. While | do not recall the issue in detail, the Trial Surveys

Report (WITN0387_01/9) suggests they were being considered and dealt with.

| was not directly involved in the financial aspects of the Programme (apart from
managing an internal budget on the Programme), and so | am unable to
comment on how issues encountered during the Programme affected the

Programme's finances.

THE TREASURY REVIEW

31.

32.

| have reviewed the ICL Pathway Memorandum on ‘Questions Raised at
Treasury Review Panel Presentation’ (“ICL Pathway Treasury Review
Memorandum’) (WITN0387_01/10), the ICL Pathway Diary Note on the
banking meeting with Frank Field (WITN0387_01/11), and the minutes of the
meeting between ICL and George McCorkell (BA) dated August 1998
(WITN0387_01/12) in considering the Inquiry’s questions about the Treasury

Review.

| recall having very limited involvement with the Treasury Review, and | struggle
to recall what its purpose or objective was. Certain documents about the
Treasury Review were circulated to me (including the documents mentioned at
paragraph 31 above), but | do not recall having any formal involvement with the

Treasury Review. As a result, | am not in a position to comment on the

Page 10 of 23

WITN03870100
WITN03870100
WITN03870100
WITN03870100

effectiveness of the Treasury Review generally, or in scrutinising the technical

integrity and robustness of Horizon.

33. In reviewing WITN0387_01/10, | was, however, prompted to recollect that the
Treasury Review had an interest in “uncarded casual agents”, which was a very
difficult problem for ICL Pathway and the Horizon system to resolve. “Uncarded
casual agents” referred to people who did not themselves hold a Benefits
Payment Card and also had no direct relationship with BA (someone who is

picking up benefits on another person’s behalf).

34. | also recall briefly meeting Frank Field, a Labour MP at the time, as part of a
group of individuals from ICL Pathway. | do not recall when this meeting was
or what its purpose was. | do not believe it was related to the meeting that is

minuted at WITNO387_01/11.

NEGOTIATIONS OVER HORIZON AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA IN LATE 1998

Negotiations over Horizon’s future in November—December 1998
35. | recall being aware that there were discussions between ICL Pathway, BA and
POCL, concerning the future of the Programme in late 1998. As Programme
Director, | would have been involved in at least some of these discussions,
however | cannot recall what was discussed or my contribution to the
discussions. | do recall having the impression that BA was not interested in the
Programme, however | cannot say whether this was during November and

December 1998 or in 1999.

Agreement between POCL and BA over Horizon’s future
36. | do not recall being involved in discussions regarding the level of agreement

between POCL and BA concerning the future of Horizon. My role was

Page 11 of 23
concerned with the work that was occurring across the Programme and

focussed with getting the Horizon platform back on track.

Changes to acceptance criteria in November—December 1998

37.

38.

39.

Despite reviewing documents referenced by the Inquiry in the Request that set
out the changes ICL Pathway proposed in relation to the acceptance criteria
for Horizon in November and December 1998, | cannot recall what the specific

proposed changes were, or the reasons for them.

Having reviewed the ‘Horizon Replan Status Report’ dated 18 November 1998
(‘Replan Status Report’) (WITN0387_01/13) and the letter from Dave Miller
(my equivalent at POCL) to me dated 10 December 1998 regarding
‘Acceptance’ (WITN0387_01/14), | can recall that as we went forward with the
Programme, there were discussions about the definition of acceptance and
who had the right to decide acceptance as there were three parties involved
(i.e., POCL, BA and ICL Pathway). | would have been involved in some of these
discussions as | attended various Programme meetings at the time, however |
cannot recall what was discussed or if the discussions took place in November

and December 1998.

| expect that John Dicks, as head of the customer requirements group at ICL
Pathway at the time, would have been largely responsible for managing
proposed changes to the acceptance criteria and the discussions with POCL
and BA. | might have been consulted on the proposed changes, but | cannot

recall.

ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN 1999, BA’S WITHDRAWAL AND TRAINING

Issues identified during development and testing in 1999

Page 12 of 23

WITN03870100
WITN03870100
WITN03870100
WITN03870100

40. | recall having a discussion with Dave Miller about POCL’s back office having
difficulties with Horizon following accounting and reconciliation testing.
However, my recollection of this meeting was prompted by the Replan Status
Report, and | cannot recall whether the discussion took place in late 1998 or

1999, and I cannot recall any further details.

41. Beyond the issue mentioned at paragraph 40, | cannot recall specific issues
that were identified during development and testing of Horizon in 1999. Testing

and development were not in my area.

42. | would have likely attended meetings and reviewed reports where such issues
would have been discussed. For example, | would have received monthly
reports (for example, the Monthly Joint Implementation Report dated April 1999
to May 1999 (WITN0387_01/15) and the ICL Monthly Progress Report dated
November 1999 (WITN0387_01/16)), and | would have received test reports
(for example, the Release 2 Model Office Rehearsal 3 Closure Report

(WITNO387_01/17)).

43. If there were specific issues that were particularly significant (for example,
where the issue risked delaying rollout or the next release of software) and
required work across more than one Programme team, | would have followed
up on the issue or assigned the follow-up to the appropriate manager.
Otherwise, | would have received high-level summaries of the issues that had

been identified and resolved, and | would not have been involved in the detail.

The withdrawal of BA and its impact
44. | cannot recall the reasons for BA’s withdrawal from the Programme, nor its

financial impact. Contractual and financial matters were not my area of

Page 13 of 23
45.

46.

responsibility, which would have fallen to others within ICL Pathway, including
the Commercial and Finance Director. As Programme Director, | may have
been consulted in relation to specific issues relating to BA’s withdrawal,
particularly where such issues required cross-programme considerations,

however | cannot recall any issues.

My impression at the time was that BA did not want the Benefits Payment Card,
as it took the department in a direction that it did not want to go — BA did not

want their services to be tied to POCL counters.

ICL Pathway managed the impact of the cancellation of the Benefits Payment
Card, including any changes that were made to Horizon as a result. | recall that
software code and certain products were removed from Horizon, and one or
more cycles of testing were completed, but nothing further. The testing may
have included a further Model Office Test. | do not recall being made aware of
any adverse impacts on the quality of the Horizon software being developed at

that time.

Issues relating to the provision of training

47.

48.

| recall being partially involved in the provision of training relating to Horizon,
but | was not involved in running the training directly. Initially, there was rollout
training provided by ICL Pathway to POCL staff and others so that they could
train end users of Horizon (‘training the trainers’) and training support staff

operating the helpdesk, which followed.

Training was key to the rollout due to the large number of Post Office branches
involved and the speed of the rollout. | recall having a discussion regarding a

key issue relating to training, which was prompted by my review of the letter

Page 14 of 23

WITN03870100
WITN03870100
from John Dicks to Bruce McNiven dated 11 August 1999 (WITN0387_01/18).
| believe my discussion was with John Dicks, and it was about POCL asking
ICL Pathway to provide more training for Horizon, and our view that POCL had
already asked for a lot of training, which ICL Pathway had delivered, and that
the remaining issues related to how POCL was managing change within its

business. | do not recall any further details.

ROLLOUT

Assessing Horizon’s performance during rollout

49.

50.

| recall that ICL Pathway and POCL were monitoring Horizon’s performance
jointly during rollout, and we reacted as best we could to issues as they arose,

however | cannot recall any specific issues.

Reviews were undertaken during rollout, and | can recall at least one review
being undertaken by PA Consulting and a joint review between POCL and ICL
Pathway relating to rollout, however | cannot recall or describe what was done.
| would have been involved in audits undertaken during rollout, including ‘Mid
Stage Quality Audits’, and would have been involved in the corrective actions
that were taken as a result of audit findings (see, for example, the Schedule of
Corrective Actions - NR2 Mid Stage Audits (Consolidated) dated 4 May 2000

(WITNO387_01/19)).

THE TECHNICAL INTEGRITY AND ROBUSTNESS OF HORIZON AT VARIOUS

STAGES

51.

In the Request, the Inquiry has asked several questions as to my
understanding, opinion and/or assessment of the technical integrity and

robustness of Horizon at various stages in the period 1998 to 2002. These

Page 15 of 23

WITN03870100
WITN03870100
52.

53.

stages are at the time of the Treasury Review, November and December 1998,
during development and testing in 1999, prior to acceptance, and during rollout.
| have also been asked to specifically consider the Electronic Point of Sale
System (“EPOSS”) PinICL Task Force and proposals from 1999 to re-

design/re-write the EPOSS code.

My main recollection about technical integrity and robustness generally is that,
at the point of acceptance, the relevant Programme teams at POCL and ICL
Pathway understood that Horizon was robust based on the process that had
been followed, including Model Office Tests. This did not mean that the
software did not have any bugs or issues that needed to be resolved, however,
we were working with POCL to achieve acceptance, and there was a concerted

joint effort.

| do not have any recollections about the EPOSS PinlCL Task Force, including
in relation to the reasons for its establishment, its findings or how its findings
may have been communicated to POCL. | reviewed, in particular, the Report
on EPOSS PinlCL Task Force dated 14 May 2001 (WITN0387_01/20), but this
has not improved my memory about the task force. Having considered that
document, | expect that | would likely have been aware of the EPOSS PinlCL
task force while | was Programme Director, as one team out of many working
on EPOSS issues. However, | do not recall having direct involvement in their
work. | considered, in particular, section 7.3 of the document regarding issues
with the EPOSS code. While | recall, generally, that there were problems with
the EPOSS code, | do not recall the specific concerns the task force raised or

whether these were communicated to POCL.

Page 16 of 23

WITN03870100
WITN03870100
54.

55.

56.

57.

| do not recall reviewing WITN0387_01/20 or any earlier drafts of it during my
involvement with the Programme. | note that | am not listed as an author of the
document or on its distribution. In addition, the report is dated 14 May 2001,

which was after my first stroke and when | was no longer working.

| recall that, prior to roll-out, there were a lot of faults with EPOSS (though | do
not remember details of specific faults). There were discussions about whether
it was preferable to redevelop EPOSS (including rewriting its code) or to make

quality improvements to the existing system.

Having reviewed the CSR+ Development Audit dated 28 October 1999
(WITN0387_01/21), | understand that a recommendation was made in an
EPOSS Solutions Report dated 21 September 1999 to “consider the re-design
and re-write of EPOSS, in part or in whole, to address the then known
shortcomings’, and that in WITN0387_01/21, it was suggested that that
recommendation be reconsidered. This recommendation was also raised again
in the Schedule of Corrective Actions: CSR+ Development Audit dated 22
November 1999 (WITN0387_01/22) and the Schedule of Corrective Actions:
CSR+ Development audit dated 10 May 2000 (WITN0387_01/23), in both

cases at item “015/04”.

My recollection is that, at the time, Terry Austin was leading an exercise to
improve the quality of EPOSS. | note that he is listed as the owner of item
“015/04", which John Bennet (while he was managing director of ICL Pathway)
and | were providing management supervision for. Having reviewed the
“Agreed Action/Commentary’ for item “015/04’ in WITNO387_01/23, my

recollection is that Terry Austin was of the view that the EPOSS system was

Page 17 of 23

WITN03870100
WITN03870100
58.

59.

60.

stabilising and it would be better to continue with quality improvements rather

than re-develop the system.

| believe there were discussions about this issue at the management level as
well, and these would likely have involved me, Terry Austin, Tony Oppenheim
and Mike Stares (who by May 2000 had taken over from John Bennet as
managing director at ICL Pathway). | understand from WITN0387_01/23 that
the conclusion reached was that ICL Pathway would accept “the ongoing costs
of maintenance rather than the cost of a rewrite”. This meant that ICL Pathway
would not try to produce a new EPOSS product, but would use available
resources to maintain the existing EPOSS product at an acceptable standard
(e.g. by managing any PinICLs). | do not recall the reasons for this decision or
the specific discussions that took place, but believe it was a judgment call by
the management team that it was not worth redeveloping the EPOSS system

as it was getting closer to becoming a stable system.

| am not in a position to say whether, in hindsight, this was a correct decision.
This is because | do not recall the specific reasons behind this decision or the
outcomes it had. | note that | suffered my first stroke less than a year after this

decision is recorded in WITN0387_01/23.

| do not specifically recall if POCL was informed of the issues with EPOSS,
though it may have come up at a high level in my discussions with Dave Miller.
However, | would have expected them to have been aware. | note that at
section 7.1.2 of WITN0387_01/20, there is a discussion of POCL’s involvement

in EPOSS in the context of the EPOSS PinlCL Task Force’s work.

MY REFLECTIONS ON THE PROGRAMME

61.

In the Request, the Inquiry has asked me to provide my reflections on a number
of matters relating to the Programme and rollout of Horizon, which | provide

below.

Whether rollout took place at the right time and Horizon’s fitness for purpose

62.

63.

64.

The acceptance process was about whether rollout was allowed by POCL, and
the decision to rollout Horizon was ultimately a judgment call taken by POCL.
ICL Pathway’s judgment call was whether to push for rollout, taking into
account the steps had been taken to design, develop, test and prepare Horizon
for rollout. We worked closely with POCL throughout all of the various stages

of the Programme to ensure Horizon met POCL’s requirements.

For me, a product or service that is fit for purpose achieves its business
purpose. In my experience, if a system is produced that fulfills the requirements
agreed between the customer and the product provider, and the product is in

operational use, the product is fit for purpose so far as its purpose is defined.

While | cannot recall the specific steps that were taken during rollout or the
discussions that were held at the time of acceptance, if | had held concerns
about the timing of the rollout and whether Horizon was fit for purpose, | would

have called for rollout to be delayed.

Whether ICL Pathway was equipped to take on a project of this size

65.

In my experience, any large project will have peaks and troughs in resourcing
and the available skills to carry out the work required. When | look back on the

work undertaken while | was involved in the Programme, my impression is that

we were not prevented from getting additional resources and assistance when
the need was identified. My appointment as Programme Director was an
example of this. The Programme had a slow start, which is what led to the
review that | led in 1997 (mentioned above at paragraph 10), and following this,

ICL Pathway got the Programme back on track.

Informing POCL and the government about technical issues
66. | cannot recall the mechanism by which ICL Pathway informed POCL and/or
the government about technical issues relating to Horizon at the management
level, including in relation to rollout and acceptance. | can recall that PinICL
management, along with the ‘Known Problem Registers’, were a mechanism
by which ICL Pathway informed POCL concerning technical issues at the

operational level.

Whether ICL Pathway should have done anything differently

67. In my experience, any project could have been done better in hindsight.

68. | can recall that when the contracts relating to Horizon had been finalised,
everyone was ‘hot off the blocks’ and wanted to do too much too quickly. The
review that | led in 1997 showed that, a complex customer-client relationship
requires good governance and processes that need to be reviewed and
modified as appropriate. The relationship was complex as it involved ICL
Pathway as a platform provider of hardware and software putting a product into
POCL’s estate for the benefit of BA. | believe that the work undertaken in
response to the review findings to put the Programme back on track worked
well. The steps that the Programme took after | joined should have been taken

sooner.

69. Another thing that ICL Pathway and POCL should have done sooner was to
ensure there were persons, teams and/or mechanisms involving ICL Pathway
and POCL that were responsible for cross-programme issues. Individual teams
and managers were looking down their silos, but in the early stages of the
Programme, no one was looking across silos. My role and team was put
together partly for this purpose. | also recall that a ‘commercial forum’ was set
up involving Tony Oppenheim, myself, Dave Miller and Tony Oppenheim’s

equivalent at POCL to address cross-programme issues.
