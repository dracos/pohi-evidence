Mr. Oppenheim issues up for contract negotiation.

95/61 OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND ALPS

Sir Michael to write to Ambassadors as above.

Singapore: need to co-ordinate sales messages and
Mr. Bennett the resource demands on Escher, and qualify the
risk of bad press resulting.

Mr. Jones IBM: seek opportunities to deploy sales messages
for Singapore (and South Africa, New Zealand?)

ALPS: get positive messages across - it is a

associated with the LANs, polling and ECCO are

@«. Jones outside ICL’s control. Note however that ALPS

provides no benefit to POCL.

95/64 PROGRAMME PLAN

Mr. Austin's description of the plan, setting out
the shape and significant scale of the task against

by the customer was noted. Progress is being made
on clearance of Category A and B risks generally
but some are being "shelved" under CNT (Core
Negotating Team): attempts are being made to move
these forward.

lead in determining the best way to secure

Mr. Todd Pathway’s position (including possible expanded use
of Riposte within ICL) and report back at the next
