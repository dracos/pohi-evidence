1 Executive Summary

This report formally records the levels of Service Performance delivered by Atos and associated
Tower Supply Chain Members in the provision of service to the Post Office for the reporting period
of February 2017.

Service Level Performance

For the eleventh consecutive month all SISD SLA targets have been achieved or exceeded. The
volume of unique Incidents reported increased from 10,051 in January to 10,261 in February, an
increase of 2.09%. Calls to the Service Desk decreased from 11,427 in January to 10,115 in
February, a decrease of 11.48%. Emails to the Service Desk increased from 5801 to 6098 (5.12%).

In terms of SISD High Severity Incidents, there were a total of four (4) Severity 1 and eleven (11)
Severity 2 Incidents open during the reporting month. These are shown as follows:

Closed Incidents

> Four (4) Severity 1 and eight (8) Severity 2 Incidents were closed within the Post Office IT
environment during the month; The Calculation of SISD1 is based on these Closed Incidents
only.

> Incidents pending closure - additionally there were no (0) further Severity 1 Incidents that were
pending closure at month end.

» There were three (3) Severity 2 Incidents that were pending closure, which will be reported on
once closed.

The full breakdown of the High Severity Incidents can be located within the Incident Management

The Change Management Service delivered another excellent performance for the month with a
99.42% success rate across the whole Post Office IT estate. There were no Incidents because of

Customer Satisfaction with the Service Desk continued to exceed target at 96.61% and has
consistently achieved this SLA since July 2015.

A total of 177 responses were received during the month, which is a decrease of 6 from 183
received in January. 81 (45.76%) of the responses submitted a maximum score of 9 for the service
received, with none submitting a score of 1.

Overall Customer Satisfaction with the IT Services delivered by all Supply Chain Members achieved
target at 83.40% the eight consecutive month it has exceeded target. Whilst not currently formally
measured until all Towers are in full operation, it has been included in the report (section 9.2) to
give an insight into the progress during the transition to full Tower operation. This currently
measures feedback across the SISD, Tower and Legacy Suppliers.

» Speed to Answer (telephone) has decreased from 84.55% to 81.62%% as a result of high call
volumes following two High Severity Incidents.

» Customer Satisfaction remained well above target at 96.61%. We are currently identifying other
ways in which we can increase the response rate to get a broader view of customer satisfaction.

and the less used categories are increasing as calls are allocated to a more appropriate category.

» Work continues to carry out a deep dive against the top call categories to discover areas for
improvement.

Incident Resolution SLA

Severity 1 - 4 Incidents

There is no contractual measurement for Severity 2’s communi

ion, this is included for information.

Commentary:

» SISD1 is based on the number of Closed Severity 1 and 2 Incidents during the reporting month.
There were four (4) Severity 1 and eight (8) Severity 2 Incidents. Three (3) High Severity
Incidents are currently in an open/ resolved status and will be reported in March's figure once
closed.

» Three of the Severity 1 Incidents closed related to Credence/MDM and an additional one of the
Severity 1 Incidents related to Drop and Go transactions. That outage was attributed to a
network issue which was identified and successfully resolved by Fujitsu within their domain.

» The eight Severity 2 Incidents closed in February were a mix of issues, three related to
telephone service, one related to Credence, one related to POLSAP Printing issues, one related to
MoneyGram transactions.

> Out of the twelve High Severity Incidents closed only one failed to meet the response KPI for
Severity 2s. This was because of the issue being resolved whilst business impact was still being
determined; as well as IM tooling issues delaying the issue of the email communications. This did
not impact the incident response SLA which was 100% again this month.

» The Service Desk saw a further increase in open Incident totals at month end however an
increase, 41 up to 57 was seen in open Aged Incidents; Incidents more than 90 days old
remained stable.

» Incidents more than 90 days old remained low however with 4 Incidents open this month, these
4 Incidents are currently under review with Incident Management and the Service Desk and are
being progressed as a matter of urgency, the Aged Incidents relate to defect 207; an OBC20
request, a VPN Key update from Fujitsu and a user issue accessing files on the project server.

» Open Incidents with Computacenter decreased this month in comparison to January. Four
Incidents were more than 14 days old at month end, two of which are hardware related and two
software related. Computacenter had zero Incidents more than 90 days old going into March.

» Most Computacenter Incidents open at month end continues to be made up of hardware related
Incidents with printer tickets accounting for a large proportion of these.

Opened 16 19 4
Closed 32 19 9
Average Time To Resolve (hours) ATTR 103:10 125:20 397:35

Commentary:

» The total number of Escalations opened this month decreased from nineteen to four. However,
the number of closed Escalations within the month decreased to nine.

» The average daily run rate for escalations through February remained low and within
manageable level for the team (averaging 8-10).

» Management of escalations in February transferred from the Incident Management team to the
Service Desk, this transition was completed successfully and escalations continue to be managed
successfully.

> The average time to resolve the escalations did increase this month, however not outside of
normal levels, it was however not in line with the downward trend seen over the past few
months and possibly linked to the transition of support from Incident Management to Service
Desk and the efforts undertaken to clear any backlog prior to the handover.

» Hardware and Branch Network Incidents continue to make up most escalations.

atalogue § Off-Catalogue

Commentary:
>» A range of Requests flow through the Service Integrator (Atos); both Standard Catalogue
Requests, and non-standard Requests which utilise the tooling, but are not baselined with
Service Levels.
» Catalogue Requests include anything that can be requested as a dedicated item via the IT
Services Portal.
> Off-Catalogue Requests are made as one-off requests into the given supplier. This includes
Legacy Suppliers, but also requests into the End User Computing Tower Supplier for non-
baselined products and services (e.g. toner for legacy printers).
> Off-Catalogue Requests are often triggered by the Can’t Find What You're Looking For item
on the IT Service Catalogue. If a request appears to be a one-off, it is sent via the Ad-Hoc
route rather than being baselined as a catalogue item.
> This approach promotes an ‘open-door’ request policy whereby users are not restricted to pre-
defined request types.
> February saw resurgence in End User Computing Requests, which is apparent in the shift in
relative proportions of each request type. EUC and Information Services were much more evenly
balanced, and the key driver for this change was Leaver Requests.
» For more detailed information on Service Catalogue Requests, and potential reasons for the
patterns experienced, see the upcoming Service Catalogue section 7.

Commentary:

» Throughout 2016, Information Services request volumes saw a series of month-on-month
increases; this followed marketing of the catalogue to the Post Office business. November 2016
initially broke this trend with a slight volume decrease, but this figure was then reduced by more
than 25% in December 2016.

>» In January, the above transformation was attributed to the slowing of business change for Peak
Period 2016. However, a negligible increase was observed for January, and volumes are
therefore being monitored to ensure they see a return to the levels of Q3 2016.

> As anticipated, a more significant resurgence in volumes was observed for February, with figures
rising above 400 once again. This is still considerably lower than volumes encountered in late
2016, however, so monitoring of the trend continues.

Commentary:

>» In November 2016, the volume of requests via this component catalogue reached an all-time
high (361). There was uncertainty as to whether April’s post-migration spike in volumes would
be exceeded at 350.

» February 2017 saw the all-time second-highest number of EUC Catalogue requests, at 352. High
volumes of Shared Access and Leaver requests logged in February are key drivers for the
increase over December and January (see ‘Service Catalogue Requests by Type’ chart).

» Since requests via this component Catalogue often originate from end users, for end users,
volumes continue to be impacted by peak holiday periods of summer and Christmas/New Year.

Commentary:

» For the first month, leaver requests outstripped other request types, at 144 overall. This is most
likely the result of changes within the Post Office business, and the requirement to close
accounts and collect unused computers for Security and Audit purposes.

> The volume of Shared Access requests was more than double that seen for January, at 65.

P Application Requests also increased from an all-time low of 26 in January, to 52 in February,
likely driven by New Starters requiring specialist software.

» Despite being moved down the list by the aforementioned top categories, New Login Account

Commentary:

» Every subsection on the EUC Service Catalogue includes a Can’t Find What You’re Looking For?
(CFWYLF) item. This is the result of high demand for non-baselined products and services
following the Catalogue Go-Live in early 2016.

» While this item has been exceedingly popular since its introduction in June, volumes of CFWYLF
requests are somewhat unpredictable. Since a peak of 50 in October, request volumes decreased
significantly in November and saw further declines through to January 2017

» For February, however, the volume of requests increased to 31. A potential driver for the
increase is the return of individuals to the office after Christmas holidays but, due to the open-
ended nature of this request type, reasons behind the changing volumes are often
difficult/impossible to identify.

» CFWYLF requests are monitored regularly, and reviewed every week to ensure each request
receives a response. These responses are typically one of the following:

» The request can be made as a non-standard request into the supplier, if a Budget Code is
provided.

> The request is for a specific ergonomic requirement (e.g. following a Workplace Assessment),
and can be ordered immediately without the above precursor.

> The request cannot be completed via the BAU Request route, and must be completed via a
Change Request (CR). Items regularly requested via the CFWYLF service are proposed as
additions to the Standard Catalogue at the monthly reviews with Supply Chain Members
and the Post Office.

» Items regularly requested via the CFWYLF service are proposed as additions to the Standard

Changes in January Included:

Commentary:

» By taking on board customer feedback, whether from Tech Bars, the Catalogue Feedback tool, or
conversations with stakeholders, enhancements have included:

> New Items.
> Changes to navigation.
> Improved item scope and descriptions.

> In January, a sizeable change to the Information Services Catalogue was workshopped and
planned. Due to the scope of this change, development and implementation would not occur until
February and, as a result, the volume of changes for January is technically 0.

» Following User Acceptance Testing, the Information Services Catalogue Change will not be
moved into the Live environment until another series of changes have been made. These are
expected to be complete by the beginning of April 2017.

» The Information Services Catalogue change involves:

> Creation of a ‘Product Manager’ menu structure to make the Information Services Catalogue
experience easier for Business users.

> Significant changes to items and descriptions.

> Removal of redundant items and relocation of some leftover items in other areas.

‘Cumulative Catalogue KPI
(Achievement of EUC8 and 95%
EUC10)

Commentary:

> 99.21% cumulative catalogue achievement for the EUC Tower in February 2017. This indicates
the high performance seen in previous months has been sustained.
> SLA performance has been maintained by:
> Spreading stock across strategic locations to increase the likelihood of a peripheral item being
available in each area.
> Relative stabilisation of request volumes following an exponential increase from January to
April.
> Addressing an SLA oversight in the form of “cut-off times” for Next Business Day items.
Peripherals were previously advertised in this way, regardless of the time at which the item
was ordered. A 3pm cut-off has been agreed with Post Office, so any items ordered after
this time are not classed as breaching SLA if they are not delivered the following day.

Why is there a ‘Cumulative Achievement’ measure?

» EUC Catalogue items are scenario-based, allowing for “bundles” of requests to be triggered
simultaneously, regardless of backend origin. They often involve a combination of services
defined as ‘Product’ (EUC 8) and ‘IMAC’ (EUC 10). ‘Product’ involves the delivery of off-the-shelf
items such as printers, mice, and keyboards. An IMAC is an engineer visit, which may be either
Standard (a physical visit to collect a piece of hardware), or Remote activity such as logging into
a user’s computer to deploy new software.

OBC and the EUC Catalogue:

» The EUC 10 measure includes OBC requests, which are technically “catalogue” requests despite
not appearing on the EUC Catalogue. This is due to complications automating the OBC process
with the current catalogue tool; instead, these ‘on-demand’ requests are triggered directly by
the Atos RFA Team.

8 Accuracy & Completeness of CMDB (SI)

Steve Borrett

Commentary:
» The measurement of the accuracy and completeness of the CMDB for the Post Office is
predicated on two key methods:
> Physical audit - based on the contractual obligation a sample (of 100 Configuration Items) is
physically audited (including attributes) each month by Computacenter who then report the
results to Atos Service Management for review. Atos Configuration Management receives a
copy of the raw audit data for review.
>» Comparison of CMDB to the electronic discovery data - Presently Computacenter (EUC &
Hosting) have refused to provide Atos with this discovery data, this is with Service
Management to progress toward a resolution.

Commentary:

> The overall IT satisfaction achieved 83.40% SLA. This was a 2.45% increase from last month.
Whilst this is not formally measure until we are in the Full Tower Model it is a great achievement
to be meeting or exceeding this SLA given the challenges of the current Legacy Model.

P» Out of the 265 feedback received this month, 221 users promoted the service and were happy
about the resolution time and manner. Some of the comments were “Excellent service received
would certainly recommend”, “Excellent service received would certainly recommend”.

> Whilst we have achieved SLA, it has not gone un-noticed that we have seen a decrease in SLA.
Reviewing the figures, it would indicate that this is a direct result of incorrect call verification and
the Post Office users not aware of contractual SLA timeframes. Below the diagram highlights the
breakdown of detractors.

Commentary:

» The largest contributor was because of Customer SLA awareness. This is where the customer is
not aware of SLA and has higher expectations of the Service. An example of this is when a user
could not receive a solution within a day.

» The second largest contributor was Closure Verification - Atos, where the ticket has been set as
resolved but issue not resolved. There is a Service Improvement open with the Service Desk to
address this issue, POSI11- POL - Service Desk - Call Closure.

This improvement in progress and it has been identified that there are two key areas in which we

could improve incorrect closure verification. They are as follows:

>» Tooling-Automation: It has been identified that if a 3rd Party is not part of e-bonding, this will
flow through to SDM12 and a closure ticket will go out to the end user, despite the issue not
being completely resolved e.g. ticket may be resolved by the associated supplier, however still
needs assistance from another party therefore the issue is still on going. Multiple corrective
actions are currently being reviewed to check whether they are compatible with the SDM12
tooling.

» Service Compliance: When reviewing the tickets which have previously been closed
prematurely we have seen in some instances the root cause is due to non-compliance by the
Service Desk Agents. Two forms of monitoring have been put in place to ensure this does not
happen:

> Quality evaluation.

> Automated report which extracts all tickets and highlights which ticket did not follow the
correct closure process. The results from the above monitoring are fed back to team leads
who then coach agents as to the correct procedure.

Trends:

>» The monthly trend review did not identify any new trends; however, we continue to progress
previous actions.

» There were only 3 complaints logged this month in relation to the long running trend regarding
tickets being closed without the engineer attending Branch, but work continues to find the root
cause. We still have the deadlock of PM’s insisting the engineer did not arrive, with the engineers
saying they did and having GPS tracking data to support this.

» Work continues to bring in the SMS system for Postmasters to sign up for (optionally) so they
can be made aware of delays to any visit such as traffic.

» February saw an impressively low number of complaints logged for the month and an even more
impressive response time from the SCM and the complaints team which has resulted in a further
decrease in simultaneous decrease in the number of aged tickets.

110043792 I P10052251 Go/PHS/SMS) Outage 2017-02-04

On Saturday 2017-02-04 a Severity 1 Incident was raised and cross-domain conference calls were attended
by the Post Office, ATOS, Accenture, and Fujitsu to investigate transaction timeouts within Post Office
Branches utilising POA2 profile services, CDP - Drop & Go, MoneyGram, Peripheral Handling Service, and
Smart Metering Services.

Analysis identified this Incident was due to a network change implemented on 3“ February under an internal
Fujitsu RFC/MSC, which was a pre-requisite to a future migration activity and was not expected to impact live
service. The change was to a network switch but the symptoms were seen via firewall traffic, to restore
service the change was regressed. Accenture later confirmed that there were no transactions processed by
CDP between 18:07 (last recorded response to Horizon on Friday evening) and 12:42 (first new request on
Saturday).

Fujitsu raised a number of actions following the incident, they are investigating why the change impacted the
live CDP route when no impact was expected and whether improvements to monitoring which could have
allowed the incident to be identified sooner.

and eight (8) Severity 2 Incidents.

» Severity 1 110043792 - Unable to complete transactions in Drop and Go (2017-02-04) - see
above table for further detail.

> Severity 1 110051806 - MDM is not accessible for all users (2017-02-07).
On 2017-02-07 Post Office users began to report that they were unable to access MDM meaning
that product data could not be amended/uploaded as required, impacting the input of branch and
product data into the Horizon system.
Accenture have confirmed this was caused by a Known Error (POL - SISD - KE004). The
WebSphere application can hang on the MDM Application Server and cause the MDM GUI to
become unavailable for users. The services have to be forcefully killed and restarted to resolve
the issue, service was restored after Accenture had performed the required restart.

> Severity 1 110053523 - Credence is unavailable (2017-02-07).
Fujitsu raised a Severity 1 Incident following issues with Active Directory Servers which resulted
in the delay of a number of files required for daily batch processing. Fujitsu confirmed this was
caused by a planned change to promote an additional Active Directory server (ACD) on the 7

February into the live estate under MSC 04330451797-03/GY:C4598246. An unexpected change
in a DNS query occurred which caused firewalls to not allow traffic through.
The action taken to resolve this incident was to demote the ACD and restore service as soon as
possible and complete the outstanding file production Fujitsu confirmed this was completed by
01:28 on the 8thFebruary. There was a subsequent impact to Accenture’s ability to process the
files which meant the Credence application was not available until 09:25.

» Severity 2 110047299 - Users unable to access CFS via portal (2017-02-06)
Following an approved Change C4616163 on 04/02/2017 to allow Accenture to update a number
of SAP components Post Office users reported they were unable to access the CFS Production
system through the web portal. Users accessing CFS from Citrix and SAP GUI had no impact.
The Change had passed development and the tests which had been performed however it was
later identified that the version of Internet Explorer which users had on their laptops had
compatibility issues with the update. Accenture with the assistance of SAP identified a suitable fix
which was deployed 2017-02-07 and CSC performed a recommended update of the SAP GUI.
Software has also been deployed which will allow SAP greater ability to assist in any future
incidents.

> P10052169 - DVLA transport issue in Disaster Recovery
A new problem record has been raised at the request of 3M. It has been identified that DVLA
Transactions will not transfer to DVLA on invocation of Disaster Recovery due to a compatibility
issue with NetFramework v4.5.2. There is no impact on the current Production environment, only
the Disaster Recovery solution if invoked. In that scenario, branches would continue to transact
as normal, UKVI & SIA transactions would be sent as normal, but DVLA transactions would be
safely stored on the AEI servers. The end user would be impacted by a delay in their application.
An escalation path to Microsoft has been engaged to ensure appropriate attention is paid to this
Problem. There is high visibility of this Problem within 3M to drive a solution.
Root Cause: NetFramework is causing compatibility issues with SSL and the libraries used by
DVLA to establish a secure connection which no longer work in the later version of NetFramework

> P10106784 - Post Office Website was slow and images were intermittently unavailable
Problem record opened following brief instability of the Post Office Website on 2017-02-22
between 12:08 and 12:30, Accenture reported slowness and potential issues displaying images.
Accenture identified that heavy logging caused this, resulting in available capacity on the hard
disks of the public servers being consumed; a ticket has been logged with the software vendor to
identify what caused these logs. Accenture have raised a change request to reduce the disk space
threshold alert to mitigate against such incident in future.
Further analysis has shown that a significant amount of space is being taken by large images,
Accenture have engaged the Post Office Digital team as to whether there is the opportunity to
optimise the images.

>» P9988648 - NEOPOST IP Configuration changes
In November NEOPOST made unannounced changes to both live and test IP addresses for the
Kahala Guaranteed Calculator which resulted in the service being unavailable, Fujitsu have since
been provided the required IP addresses and have carried out the required configuration changes
to restore service.
The problem record remains open as Fujitsu are awaiting a retrospective CR to be raised for the
configuration changes and required update of design documentation; this has been requested
from the Post Office via Atos Service Management.

Commentary:

Our average age of Problem Records has decreased to 76 days from last month’s figure of 83 days.

Top 3 Aged Problems:

» P0000240 - Performance related issue requested by project team.
The sub problem (PBI700000405010) is being progressed between Accenture and DigIdentity
and remains the only outstanding activity against this problem record. DigIdentity have failed to
respond to several requests to provide an update in relation to the ticket which they raised, this
has been escalated to the Atos Service Management team to assist.

Pm P9556699/P0000249 - Stuck Recovery Transaction - Error 0058 (counter got stuck).
Atos Information Services have advised investigation will continue in April post-tariff
implementation. It is believed at this stage that the script requires a straight forward fix to
ensure on automated recovery that null data is not “recovered” to the transaction.

® P9490035- SDM12 Ticket Bridging issue.
Following several Incidents over the previous 12 months a ticket was raised to engage internal
Atos support teams to understand whether there was an underlying problem in relation to
sporadic issues affecting the flow of Incidents between the Atos and external Supplier's toolsets.
Details of Incidents logged by the Atos Service Desk were provided to the Global tooling team
but no single root cause has been determined, it has been identified that planned maintenance
and internal/external network issues are common causes of tickets being raised.
It has been agreed that further monitoring will take place and increased emphasis has been
placed on the support teams to provide in depth analysis of any incidents moving forwards.

Commentary:

» No High Severity Incidents were logged in February for the EUC Tower. The pro-active analysis
of hardware tickets which were provided to Computacenter have been reviewed, Computacenter
have stated that the hardware is aged and requires replacement to see a significant reduction in
incidents being logged. The 3 outstanding Problem Records from January have been closed
leaving no Problem Records currently open.

» P9623997 - Network Connectivity Issues for several location
Computacenter have confirmed that the outstanding action remaining against this problem
record has been completed and the problem record has been closed. Auto-prioritization to
generate incidents automatically from the Synergy monitoring suite is now in place. Incidents
will be automatically routed from the suite to the technical team for resolution and escalating
triggers to team & senior management where necessary.

» P9778202 - Investigation into Microsoft Excel slow performance.

Atos SM have approved closure of this PR. Investigations into perceived performance issues
highlighted several areas where users might be using the application for none suitable purposes.
Computacenter made recommendations such as reducing data within the files and removing
links to other files, users are also accessing files from a central location which is also causing
issues. Computacenter shared outputs of their investigations with the Post Office and an RCA
was produced.

» P9608797 - OneDrive - Documents not synchronizing to the server
Atos SM have approved closure of this PR. Accenture have performed investigations and have
stated that limitations of the software and user knowledge on its use are the main call drivers.
Accenture also clarified that different versions of MS Office exist on the estate for compatibility
reasons with legacy applications.

As part of the initiative the following Service Improvements are underway:
> Improve the quality of the IVR (POS131) - we have been receiving a large volume of
detractors from Rant and Rave over the last six months regarding the quality of the IVR
recordings. In addition, feedback also highlighted that end - users found the IVR confusing due
to the volume of options. Atos have therefore worked closely with the Post Office to restructure
the IVR, and record some better quality recordings. The below outlines the improvement
updates:
> New IVR Structure Agreed with the Post Office (now 13 options rather than 21) - Complete,
» IVR recording on the Post Office Broadcasting equipment - Complete,
> Testing to be completed by 8° March 2017 - Complete,
> Communications drafted and submitted to Post Office Corporate Communications - Complete,
> Live into production - Scheduled for 13" March by 0700.
» Reduce Premature Ticket Closure (POS11) - currently the detractors we are receiving on
Rant and Rave are linked with incorrect ticket closure. There have been two identified root
causes for this:
> Agent Compliance: In some instances, the root cause is due to non-compliance by the
Service Desk Agents, for example the 3 strike rule not being followed,

> Bridging Issues: It has been identified that if a third party is not part of e-bonding, this will
flow through to SDM12 and a closure ticket will go out to the end user, despite the issue not
being completely resolved e.g. the associated supplier may resolve ticket, however still
needs assistance from another party therefore the issue is still on going.

> The following actions are currently in place to progress this Service Improvement:
> Agent Compliance: A daily automated report is generated which extracts all tickets and

highlights which ticket did not follow the correct closure process. The results from the

above monitoring are fed back to team leads who then coach agents as to the correct
procedure.

> Bridging Issues: Currently Atos are in the process of piloting a change in the ways of working
between our Service Desk and 3rd Party Suppliers. Verizon are the first Supplier we are
targeting to implement a change in approach, whereby rather than the Supplier closing or
resolving a ticket which has been misrouted to them, they have the ability to place the
ticket on “Customer Time” thus not impacting upon their own SLA’s but can then also
redirect the ticket back to the Atos Service Desk to be picked up and placed into a specific
queue set up for tickets which have been misrouted and thus be redirected to the correct
resolving group. By doing this we avoid premature closure of the ticket and reduce the
chance a negative perception of service to the end user who would no longer be incorrectly
notified that their issue has now been resolved. We are currently in discussion around an
appropriate period seen to be acceptable/reasonable for a 3rd Party to hold a ticket on
“Customer Time” giving sufficient opportunity for the Service Desk to allocate the ticket
correctly and achieve resolution.

>» Knowledge Articles (POS12) - there are currently 1621 Knowledge Articles. A review off all

current Knowledge Articles held on the Service Desk is to take place. This involves the

participation off all SCMs, Service Management and Knowledge Management. In the month of

February138 Knowledge Articles were reviewed.

» The monthly transaction volumes have been consistently breaching Amber RAG Target for the

identify if this poses a risk moving forward. If this is in fact the case a formal risk will be raised
with the appropriate recommendations.

Automated Payments System (APS):

» Transaction volumes breached the RAG Amber Status monthly contracted volume for February
2017 by approximately 3.86%.

> Although the Average Weekly volumes for February 2017 were within agreed transaction
volumes, they breached the RAG Amber Status weekly contracted volumes by 5.12% on the
second week 0.76%, on the third week 1.39% and 2.82% on the fourth week.

» Average daily transaction volumes remained within the agreed transaction volumes for February
2017 (41.43%).

» Average hourly transaction volumes remained well within the RAG Green targets throughout
February 2017 (30.32%).

» The cause of the ongoing high transaction volumes has been previously identified as the

collection of additional information about Dangerous Goods in Parcels at POL Counters, and the
subsequent APS transactions created by these.

Recommendation:

> A formal Risk has been raised around the APS Transaction Volumes (Atos Risk reference R142)
as the current contractual levels will not be sufficient for future forecasted volumes. Post Office
have approved the Change Request response from Fujitsu.

15.2.2 General Web Services (GWS)

New GWS resilient pair:

» The following services which still run on the Horizon Interstage platforms have individual
contracted volumes within PA/PER/033 with Fujitsu: DVLA, Kahal, Telecoms BACS, APOP and
PCAI.

> As part of the Horizon Data Centre Refresh these services are being migrated to a new GWS
resilient pair.

» As GWS is a single framework, its Contracted Volumes are available to any/all of the services
running within it. This presents an opportunity to measure/report on all the migrated services as
a whole rather than having existing individual limits.

Recommendation:

Update PA/PER/033 to show the individual services contained within each of the two GWS resilient
pairs and report on the overall volumes for each pair. This would allow for additional web-services
to be added as a GWS service without any Capacity changes so long as the predicted volumes for
additional services fit within the overall maxim volumes for that particular GWS pair. Alternatively
Fujitsu can continue reporting the service volumes individually, but if any of these services grew
beyond its individual contracted volumes it would incur a charge to change PA/PER/033. A formal
Service Improvement has been raised via the Atos CSI Review Board and the Post Office have
informally accepted this recommendation the Post Office to formally accept this Service
Improvement and raise the relevant Change Request against Fujitsu to cover this.

15.2.3 Back Office Application

PODG (Post Office Data Gateway):

» Maximum number of routes used in PODG increased slightly to 545 during February 2017.

> The maximum number of files transferred in February 2017 was 2434. This is slightly up on the
previous period.

> The table below details the past 13 months’ maximum files transferred totals-trends.

15.2.4 Common Digital Platform Gateway (CDP)

Web Common Digital Platform:

» Transaction volumes breached the actual monthly contracted volume for February 2017 by
approximately 354.90%,

» Average Weekly volumes breached the actual weekly contracted volume for February 2017 by
approximately 245.70%

> Average daily transaction volumes breached the actual daily contracted volumes by
approximately 162.97%

» Average Hourly transaction volumes breached the actual hourly contracted volumes by
approximately 109.57%

CDP Gateway Transaction volumes are again significantly above agreed contractual volumes.
The cause of these excessive transaction volumes has previously been identified as the new
MoneyGram service introduced by Post Office towards in the second half of 2015.

Recommendation:

A formal Risk has been raised around the CDP Transaction Volumes (Atos Risk reference R151), as
the current contractual levels are not sufficient for existing and/or future volumes. The Post Office
has raised a Change Request to uplift the CDP volumes, which Fujitsu have responded to. This is
now with the Post Office to review/update/respond.

Risk Title Uncertainty of EUC Recovery during failover

There is a high possibility that the EUC service will become unavailable in the event of a
disaster. This has become realized during the annual failover planning where it has
Summary been identified that 3rd Party intervention may be required. However, it is not clear yet
which 3rd Parties must be involved and what actions they will be required to perform
during a failover.

The Post Office will experience a loss in admin services, Customer dissatisfaction,
financial losses, and reputational damage.

‘Computacenter to identify the 3rd Parties so that impact assessments can be
performed. Atos are awaiting confirmation from Computacenter. Atos believe that the
following but not limited to are the 3rd Parties to involve:

Fujitsu,

Mitigation car,

csc,

Interchange,

Post Office Managed IP addresses (companies/individuals),

Cash Centers (CVIT).

‘Atos (Anna Schofield) and the Post Office (David Hargreaves) are working with
Computacenter to drive mitigations forward.

Top 3 Legacy Supply Chain Member Risks (based on potential Impact to Service):

Risk Title NBSC Call Management - Intelligent call management
Because of the BT ICM (intelligent call management) platform due to be switched off
completely in 31% March 2017.

This will have an impact upon the NBSC service operation. Which will result in Post
Office Branches with no contact services for Branch needs.

Summary

Consequence

Mitigation The Post Office to procure alternative solution prior to March 2017.

BT will need formal CR raising by the Post Office and financials in place to proceed as
Latest Update soon as soon as possible. Rebecca Barker in the Post Office is finding out what the
latest position is on this.

Risk Title Horizon - Branch Network Services (BNS)

Because of the existing BNS service contract with Fujitsu expiring on 31% March 2017
there is a high possibility that all Post Office Branches will cease to trade post this date.

Summary

The Post Office will experience Huge Financial consequences, damage to reputation and
brand, unwanted media coverage.

Complete transition to Network Tower before 31% March 2017 or extend the BNS service
provision with the incumbent supplier - Fujitsu. To mitigate the end of life services,

raise a change request asking Fujitsu to undertake on new study on these risks or build
into the contract extension.

Consequence

Mitigation

‘A 6 month and final extension of the ISDN service has been put in place with Vodafone.
TENG al Ec A support extension of the ADSL service has been put in place with Fujitsu. The new
Verizon VSAT solution is currently being rolled out and on schedule.

Risk Title SHA1-SHA2 Certificates - Post Office Managed Services

Due to plans within the industry to transition browser based SSL certificates from SHA1
Summary to SHA2, There is a risk that some applications and devices can only support SHA1
certificates which may cause service disruptions.

The Post Office will experience financial consequences, reputational damage, and
(een Me customer dissatisfaction. Atos will experience a sudden rise in Service Desk Call
Volumes resulting in SLA failures and a knock on affect to other services.

Post Office to confirm which 3% Party clients will be using and deploying SHA2
Mitigation certificates. Fujitsu to investigate what equipment will be affected by these changes and
provide a solution/proposal to avoid any service disruption.

It is still not clear if and when any Post Office 3" Party Clients will be making certificate
MeyetiatI-Ficie changes this year. Fujitsu have requested that the Post Office raise a CR to perform the
design study surrounding this.

> A small increase in the total volume of Network Transformation projects were received during
the month but overall OBC volumes are consistently around the 180 a month mark.

P As yet we have not had sight of Crown Transformation forecast information. This has been
requested to assist with demand management across all IT suppliers involved in delivery.

>» The Branch Counter Refresh program is to using the OBC process to decommission the 42
outgoing VSAT solutions provided by Fujitsu but the installation of the new Verizon solution
and all subsequent Branch counter refresh activities is to be managed entirely by the
program teams.

» There are presently no open Change Requests in progress relating to the OBC service.

Risks & Issues

> Emergency Branch closure process - Is on the Risk register, despite several conversations
no further action has been taken. As things stand the Post Office does not have an emergency
closure service in place with IT Suppliers and therefore, given the dependency on them, any
requirement can only be supported on a reasonable endeavours basis by Atos.

20 Tower Performance Summary
20.1 Computacenter (EUC)

Rob Walker

Performance

Computacenter’s performance summary for February 2017 covers the Branch LPOSS, the
transformed Admin Service, OBC and the Interim 1st line Service Desk.

Computacenter’s Incident Resolution EUC3 is again reported as failing target using SDM12 data,
however if the Computacenter exceptions were signed off and agreed then this would be 96.32%
and achieved target. All remaining Service Levels in February were achieved.

The returned tickets to the Atos Service Desk reduced by 20% in February.

Atos went live with Phase 2 of the First Contact Resolution service mid-February; the only tasks
remaining with Computacenter are 10 tasks relating to mailbox administration. These will be
migrated to Atos once the technical issues with DARs and the ‘Quick Connect’ elements are
resolved.

There were twelve complaints received by the Computacenter Service Management team in
February all of which were responded to within the 5-day target.

There were no Microsoft Security patches released in February, this was communicated to Atos and
the Post Office during the month as soon as Computacenter were made aware.

The File Server Data interim service continues to be run as an interim service until the data is
moved to the SharePoint environment.

There were no health checks conducted in February due to no branches logging multiple incidents
triggering an investigation. The benefits for 2016 health checks were concluded for Q4, overall
there was a 44% reduction in Incidents post the health checks at those sites visited saving the Post
Office £7,516.53. The total savings for 2016 were £13,383 and 25% reduction in Incidents. This
initiative is a permanent ongoing process to help reduce Post Office costs and improve customer
satisfaction.

Computacenter are doing some analysis on the usage of OneDrive to help identify users who are
not backing up their files. In addition, our Workplace Specialist was engaged by Post Office in
February to undertake some user education in the Chesterfield and Bolton sites. Output of the
sessions will be analysed and presented to the Post Office with recommendations on next steps,
during March.

Following improvement activities undertaken jointly by Atos and Computacenter to improve
Incident data quality the number of Incidents with “Not Mapped” in the categorisation has reduced
to 800 in February from 1,094 in January and peaking at 2,217 in October 2016.

After discussion with ISAG in October, Computacenter are looking at both the patching timelines to
reduce the time between Patch Tuesday and full deployment to clients whilst still undertaking

robust testing. Computacenter have also provided POL ISAG with an outline draft on the potential
move of some applications from Tiers 3 and 4 (not managed by Computacenter) to Tier 1 and 2
(managed-partially by Computacenter).

Risks and Issues

Recurring operational Risks that have the potential to impact the Service include:

» Automation of Branch opening hours aligned to both SDM12 and ITSM. The Branch opening
hours issue is scheduled to be resolved so ITSM reports the SLA correctly if the development is
successful. This is purely an ITSM fix and will not fix the reporting for the Atos SDM12 system. It
does not stop and start the SLA clock but calculates the SLA to the opening hours rather than
the SLA service hours.

» The HR People Data feed from ATOS to Computacenter for loading into ITSM in support of EUC
services has been cancelled by Ben Cooke. Computacenter have been informed that this will now
not proceed whilst Ben finds the ‘single source of truth’, however the risk here is in the lack of
updates to the AD estate and knock on effects on Asset Management accuracy and hence non-
compliance.

» The lack of a defined JML process is still causing some issues, specifically around leavers’ email
addresses still appearing on the Outlook Global Address List. This is due to Computacenter only
being able to disable the AD account; the deletion of accounts process has been raised with Atos
as there are implications on OneDrive and SharePoint files if accounts are deleted

» The go live of the Verizon Network Tower and the Branch Counter Refresh project will see
branches being re-IP’d; the Admin Network will also need to be re-IP’d. Computacenter will then
become the custodians and management of the IP addressing. Whilst this is positive and will aid
our Asset compliance position where we have struggled to get IP subnets from BT. It presents a
service risk during the project phases on the BAU service. A CR is currently with Post Office for
the remaining IP subnets.

20.2 Accenture (BOSM)

Performance

POLSAP
» Accenture team have completed the End of Year Audit requirements related to POLSAP.
» No major POLSAP issues during the month.

CFS

» Accenture team performed the ERP and BO Service Pack upgrade for CFS. Though the upgrade
was successful the users experienced issues with accessing CFS via the SAP portal. This was
resolved by implementing a fix suggested by SAP in the first week of February. A PIR was
performed for this issue and corrective actions were implemented.

> A fix for the most escalated Incidents related to duplicate payments and missing documents in
November was provided by SAP and successfully implemented in February.

» Monthly Patching activities for both production and non-production environments were
successfully completed.

> No major FMI issues during the month.

Credence-MDM

» Credence Batch overruns due to batch job delays reduced significantly in February. Overruns
were reported on only 2 days in February.

» The pending incident counts for Credence have been brought in control and the backlog number
of incidents is less than 20 Incidents at present. Daily tracking on escalated Credence Incidents
has been put in place and a status is provided to the Post Office every day. Four High Severity
Incidents were resolved by the team in February.

> Incidents related to the MDM to Credence interface failures and MDM reference data editing are
being dealt on severity but the support required from other vendors have been highlighted to
the Post Office.

» Accenture team Supported Fujitsu MPLS failover and WAN switch uplink migration projects.

» Accenture team has begun work on the financial year closing activities for Credence/MDM - 2
CRs related to this work are in progress.

» Accenture team is actively working on Batch optimisation work and also supporting the Azure
platform upgrade project. Weekly status is being provided to the Post Office on these
workstreams.

Traka
» Traka server patching was successfully completed in February.

Highlights

» Accenture team resolved a total of 410 incidents in the month of February. The Incident
Resolution volumes have decreased by close to 20% in the month of February compared to the
previous month mainly due to a reduction in Credence/MDM Incidents.

» 4 Problem Records and 16 operational Changes were completed successfully in February.
Operational Changes included the monthly patching of servers in production and non-production
environments for CFS/FMI/Traka.

» Overall 66 operational Changes have been completed by Accenture from the time of takeover of
support.

> Installation of Monthly security patches on Windows and Linux servers hosting CFS/FMI/Traka
applications has been completed successfully in February.

SLA-KPI Summary
» Accenture Back Office team has met 14 out of the 16 SLA’s measured for the month of February.
» The two SLAs that failed to achieve target were:
> BOTO4 - Report Delivery - Performance Data was not received until the 10" working day of
the month.
> BOTOS - Failed Changes - C4574928 - Emergency Change summary table rebuild to remove
incorrect data from Credence.

Infrastructure SLA‘s for Server, storage, network and environment availability in line with the
contractual requirements.

» The SLAs related to Service Catalogue and Disaster Recovery are not reported due to the
absence of tools-mechanism to measure these SLAs.

Risks and Issues

> POLSAP infrastructure requires immediate upgrade as currently it is not equipped to handle the
Application.

> Credence Application infrastructure needs immediate attention as it End of Life and out of
support and is causing application outages on a regular basis. An upgrade to Microsoft Azure
Infra is being planned.

» Credence Knowledge Transfer from CGI must be re-visited as it is incomplete and additional
support -shadowing is required for Accenture to provide a better service.

» CFS and FMI QA and Development environments are out of sync and need to be updated to
ensure the data is aligned.

> The business must provide Change Request prioritisation as this is currently not in place. This is
required for resource planning and capacity management. Weekly calls are scheduled with the
Business to prioritise Change Requests.

24 Performance Summary: Supply Chain Members

24.1 Performance Summary - 3M

Service Performance

» The volume of transactions across the estate were slightly higher than forecast this month with no
obvious reason as to why but SLA’s were maintained as per previous months.

> The AEI Service was stable this month with no High Severity Incidents or significant events.

» A key focus for the Service Desk and Engineering teams has been to continually asses and improve the
diagnostic capabilities to restore or maintain service as quickly as possible. This has been evident by
the gradual decrease in the volume of P3 Incidents raised and volume of engineering visits. This has
the effect of providing a dependable service to the end user but it only takes a small number of
failures to breach the Service Level for P3 Incidents. Despite only 2 out of 80 Incidents failing the 12-
hour fix target the SLA attainment is red for the month; it is challenging to achieve a 100% Green in
the current solution.

» This month also saw the continuation of the Post Office Franchise Programme which required the
Service Desk and Engineers to facilitate 24 OBC events; which is the second highest total in the
history of the Service.

» The CBES replacement project (IEN #1) completed the Pilot phase successfully, which will instigate
planning of the rollout strategy.

Transaction Analysis

» The volume of Incidents this month were in line with expectations with 79,490 completed.

» The trend of Incident volumes has been steady over the past 24 months, however, DVLA TYRR
continues to decline due to the on-line capability in place.

» SIA volumes have increased over 100% year on year since July 2016 due to a change in policy from
the SIA.

Service Desk
> There was a total of 921 Incidents and Requests logged to the AEI Service Desk in February, achieving
all SLAs well above target.
> There were no High Severity Incidents in February.
> OBC events saw an increase of 11 events on the previous month taking the total to 20. This was due
to a number of Post Office franchise programme events which used the new Post Office strategy of
using distinct Branch Closure and Branch Opening events to minimise the time an area will be without
an active Post Office.
> The number of Engineering visits is also gradually reducing from 233 to 223 as is the number of
incidents requiring a revisit which indicates that the diagnostic capability of the Service Desk and
Engineers are improving.
> The ticket breakdown at the desk are as follows:
Severity 3x 77,
Severity 4x 454,
© OBC Visits - 20,

>» SLA 23 - Severity 3 Restoration of Service or work around implemented in less than 4 hours has
decreased from 94.66% to 91.25%. 7 Incidents pout of 80 were not resolved within 4 hours.

» SLA 24 - Severity 3 Restoration of Service or work around implemented within 12 hours decreased
from 98.47% to 97.5%. 2 Incidents out of 80 were not resolved within 12 hours.

It has been highlighted to Post Office Vendor Management that the SLA’s regarding Severity 3 restoration
is unachievable. 3M have received acknowledgement from Vendor Management and will review SLA’s in
their Strategic Meetings.

Service Improvements
There are a number of Service Improvements taking place during 2017.

» AEI Disaster Recovery Data Centre Relocation.
> Engagement with key stakeholders is underway.
> The options have been provided to Suppliers which will ensure continuation of DR service and to
ensure 3M is able to keep to key Project milestones.
» Challenges around environment and resource planning for Q1 2017.
There are a number of significantly sized projects in scope for delivery in Q1 2017
> Network replacement for Home Office.
> AEI Disaster Recovery Data Centre Relocation.
> Identity services - verify in Branch solution architecture.
> IT Health Check and remediation.
> Upgrades to branch equipment (CBES PC, Camera and monitor) under Infrastructure Event Notices.

In order to deal with this 3M have allocated a dedicated Programme Manager to help reduce impact to

service.

> Continuation of driving the Infrastructure Event Notices for Cameras and CBES PCs to delivery.
> Completion of Pilot for CBES PC Replacement, ensuring progress on the Camera software solution

and invocation of the analysis phase of IEN#3 for LCD monitors.

» Escalate and formulate a resolution path with Atos for the reduction of misdirected calls to the AEI
Service Desk.

» Engagement with Atos Problem Management has identified opportunities to improve knowledge for
Atos Service Desk resources and to provide Post Office branches with guidance for the appropriate
support option for them to call

Risks
> No additional Risks have been added this month.

Problems

> Misdirected calls to the AEI Service Desk. - The volume of misdirected calls is increasing and 3M have
implemented a process to capture the reasons for misdirection. Using this information, the actions to
reduce this volume are:
> Update all knowledge articles at the II Service Desk,
> Include a few words in the communications for the updated IVR.

Commentary:

» Post Office Government Services have not provided a response in regard of arranging Branch Focus
communications advising of the commencement of the next mandatory 6 monthly audit of AEI user
accounts. In early October the Atos AEI control team requested that the AEI user audit proforma be
included in branch focus communications at the earliest opportunity. As the Post Office have not
responded to several update requests a Risk (R214) has been raised with the Atos SISD Risk
Compliance manager.

» 465 Branches did not respond to the AEI audit of accounts carried out in May 2016. Post Office
Information Security/Post Office Managed Services have been informed. A risk has been raised re non
responses and transferred to Post Office Ltd for internal ownership. Post Office Risk

> Post Office Limited has requested that 81 senior managerial level colleagues (10 hold higher level
Post/Home Office Security Clearance) are fast tracked through the UKV&I CTC (Counter Terrorism
Checks) application process to provide UKV&I cover in the Post Office Crown network (Industrial Action
cover). To date the AEI control team has received and processed some 75 applications. 38 colleagues
have successfully completed the process and now have a UKV&I account, with a further 39 applications
in progress. 4 applications having been cancelled.

» Atos AEI control team have migrated AEI account details for 90 Crown Office which have moved to WH
Smith under the Crown Office Network Transformation Programme. This is an ongoing piece of work as
the transformation programme is rolled out to include further Crown Office closures. This piece of work
also includes deactivation of AEI user accounts where the account holder has not transferred to WH
Smith but left Post Office Limited.

> UKV&I Counter terrorism clearance renewals - 34 Post Office colleagues were put though the initially
agreed Post Office Counter Terrorism Checks renewal process in February 17. These 34 colleagues now
move onto the next stage of the renewal process i.e. completion and return of Home Office visitor/
renewal form. Once the Home Office carry out their checks, clearances will be granted in line with the
Post Office Counter Terrorism Checks renewal date. Under the new process, Post Office Security
Vetting have provided the Home Office with a list of approximately 600 colleagues whose security
clearance was due to expire in 2017. The Home Office will inform the AEI control team of the outcome
of these applications in due course.

> An AEI Process and status update workshop has been held between Atos AEI Control Team. Post Office
Security Vetting, Post Office Government Services, Post Office CNB Programme, and the Head of WH
Smith Post Office Operations. The purpose of the workshop was for Atos AEI Control Team to provide
WH Smith with a detailed walkthrough of the UKV&I/DVLA application process, a Q&A session and to
also provide WH Smith with an update on status of UKV&I/DVLA account holders in post/applications
currently in progress in high profile WH Smith offices. A follow up meeting has been scheduled for
early March 2017.

24.3 Performance Summary —- Accenture CDP

Service Performance

February which is illustrated below:
> In February Common Digital Platform achieved 100% availability which exceeded the target of
99.95%.
>» 99.89% of External Users response time was within 3 seconds, which exceeds the target of 90%.
> 98.9% of severity 3 and 4 incidents were achieved within the contracted SLA, this exceeds the
target of 95%.

There were two Incidents reported during the month relating to the Common Digital Platform.

> On the 9" of February there was an issue in Fujitsu’s domain which caused connectivity issue between
CDP applications and PODG (110058479). This means that all CDP PODG dependent batches failed. It
was identified that this was as a result of a configuration change in Fujitsu’s domain. A work around
was implemented by Accenture quickly to eliminate any potential business impact. A permanent fix
has now been implemented (C4637086).

» Voice Incidents - Incidents increased to 129 in February, following 109 in January. While this is a
considerable increase, and marks an 11-month high for Voice incidents, it is still well in-line with
volumes seen throughout the course of the BT Service Contract. It is also significantly lower than the
volume for February 2016 (183).
> It should be noted that a significant proportion of Voice incidents relate to the mobile service, and

therefore include handset Requests (raised as Incident tickets due to the lack of dedicated
Request service in place).

Planned Changes
» Three ‘General Maintenance’ activities (C4648545, C1508742, C4676409).

» Cloud Contact General Maintenance (C4671816).

» Powercycling of a malfunctioning outbound BT modem in CSC’s Maidstone Datacentre (C1517857).
> Airwatch Console Software Upgrade (C1522204).

> Eastbourne CVIT closure (C1572155).

Key Projects

» O2 to EE SIM refresh - the EE SIM Migration continues, with all VIP SIMs successfully migrated in
February (Phase 1 completed).

> The BAU work request stack has remained relatively stable this month - 54 open Work Requests (an
increase of 5 over January), 13 at Acknowledge or Plan/Schedule stages, 9 at Customer Approval, 27
at Implementation and 5 at Customer Acceptance (0 Awaiting Closure this month). Fortnightly reviews
of the work stack are now taking place with BT, Post Office, and Atos, which have led to quicker
progress.

Capacity

» Formal Capacity Management is now undertaken by the Post Office directly with BT.

» The February Capacity report highlights one new cases of over-utilisation on-estate. This is now being
monitored.

Issues

> ICM End of Life - Atos Risk Ref R172 - The Post Office Risk Ref ITRisk_124. Support for the ICM and
Branch Locator platform has now been extended until the end of October 2017. This has eliminated
potential issues in the short term, but after October the platform will be unsupportable; monitoring of
the medium to long-term risk will therefore continue with BT.

» Planned Engineering Works (PEWs) - BT is still unable to deliver official Planned Engineering Works
notifications that are specific to the Post Office. However these are shared with the SISD Service Desk
as and when required.

» Split Billing PSTN Lines - This service does not have any formal service wrap with either Atos or BT at
present. BT continue to report a high volume of inbound orders that are above levels that can be
supported by the IT BAU provisioning team, and has provided a proposal back to the Post Office with
options (awaiting decision).

» Whitelisting: Training on this solution (a Portal accessed by the Post Office) took place in January.
There is still the wider issue of the end to end process. Atos Security Operations has flagged this to the
Post Office ISAG on several occasions as this requires the Post Office to have a Risk-Information
Owner.

» Ashford Crown Office - Admin Connectivity Issue - there have been issues connecting to the Admin
network in Ashford Crown Branch. An engineer attended and corrected the problem in early March
2017.

24.5 Performance Summary — CSC
Performance

Highlights

» CSC continues to help with the ad-hoc manual creation and processing of weekly critical reports to
Santander since Dec’16, Post Office has been able to avoid a financial penalty to the tune of £20,000
per week.

» CSC is supporting the follow-up queries raised by Rebecca Barker related to the End of Year Audit and
creating a SAP Law report requested by Alistair Price.

» CSC supported with reviewing the Post Office Service Desk Knowledge Articles related to CSC
supported services.

» CSC facilitated a change control for BT’s access to Maidstone Data Centre for restaging of a BT owned
modem that helped mitigate a potential Severity 2. This is otherwise a support gap under Safe Haven
as CSC is not contracted for raising any Changes for Post Office WAN providers.

® 10th Mar’17 - CSC acted swiftly in logging an Incident with TTI for a Transtrack pre-announcements
issue that was raised as a Severity 2 by Post Office/Atos. CSC’s role was prompt albeit limited to
getting updates from TTI and passing them over to Atos IM/MIM.

Lowlights
» Funds available against CR194 which is now being used for Active Directory account Management of

Citrix plus Dynamic Apps as well as for Manual reports for Dynamic Apps have exhausted. This needs
immediate attention to ensure CSC can support uninterruptedly the above streams.

» TTI resources have admin privileges on the Transtrack production environments. Decision outstanding
to revoke these.

» WCS Service mitigation actions are awaiting application (JDA) involvement which is out of scope for
csc.

» Certain application servers hosted by CSC are showing high utilization where it needs corrective
actions from Post Office 3rd parties. Two such instances relate to Project server and Transtrack where
CSC has no 3rd Party management scope for project server (highlighted as a service gap) and the
Transtrack server issue needs Atos’ mediation in getting updates from TTI.

SLA-KPI Summary
> All Incidents met SLA targets during February.
» There were 10 Changes made during February, with all being successfully completed achieving 100%

Risks and Issues

» The current SAP versions (4.7) in SAP HR Application are obsolete and special customer support runs
out in December 2017 (TBC with the Post Office as they own the commercial contract with SAP).
Although this provides basic support there might be limitations leading to Risks to the Application and
Service that cannot be defined or ascertained.

» The legacy shared drives from the Post Office estate were moved to the CSC cloud platforms under the
data migration project, with end user drive management performed by Computacenter in the EUC
Tower.

» The standard data backup retention period for data on the Cloud Platform services is 30 days, and
therefore any file deleted from a share will not be recoverable after 30 days. It is possible that this

may need to be retained for longer than 30 days for audit, traceability, tax or forensic purposes. CSC
are not aware that an audit or classification of the data contained in the shared drives has been
performed.

» Lack of EUC consolidated BAU AD admin and Application access process for services supported by CSC.
In addition, the end user access for most of the Safe Haven Applications was configured via
postofficelimited.com as a workaround because the EUC Tower was not fully integrated to source this.

» Lack of Security Certficates expiry notifications and renewal process that are issued and authorized by
POL CA installed on CSC's infrastructure.

» SAP HR end to end DR testing and process documentation not provisioned

> Lack of 3rd Party management for incidents, changes etc. for Project Server application hosted on CSC
cloud infrastructure.

24.6 Performance Summary - DigIdentity

> Due toa lack of engagement from DigIdentity a formal Change Request is to be raised by Andy Garner
to off board the Service.

24.7 Performance Summary - Fujitsu

Highlights/Lowlights include:
> Branch and Counter availability during the core day and critical periods continues to be above the SLA
of 99.64% with all the availability figures increasing on Januarys figures.

There were 4 Incidents during February that contributed to the availability of counters. Details as follows:

> 4 February - Horizon Business Server (HBS) - Monitoring reported super events affecting HNGx
counters connectivity to the Branch Access Layer. This impacted transactions for CDP-Drop & Go,
MoneyGram - Npower, the Peripheral Handling Service and Smart Metering Services (HBS POAO2
service) and was related to routing changes on firewall 5 (MSC 0430452170).
Issue within Fujitsu's domain (ATOS Ref: 110043792 / Fujitsu Ref A14952878).

> 13" February - Brocade Reboot - Monitoring reported numerous alerts from LPRPBDS202 and
LPRPNPS202 servers. This caused a blip on banking and multi-pathing on NPS and BDS
servers. Fujitsu UNIX found the events were as a result of the switch reboot following a
connection blade 2 error.
Issue within Fujitsu's domain (ATOS 110070787, Fujitsu Ref: A15061075).

> 14" February — LNS Authentication Issue - Monitoring reported ADSL branches failing above threshold.
Investigation between Fujitsu Core ISP and Networks found an authentication issue with one of the
LNS routers. With the device taken out of the authentication file, connectivity for branches resumed to
BAU state.
Issue within Fujitsu's domain (Fujitu Ref - A15065897 ATOS Ref: 110071980).

® 22° February - Crash of a connection blade - Monitoring reported Banking, E Top Up, AP OutPayments
and Branch Access critical on HORIce. VocaLink and POCA banking and E-Top ups were affected, with
transactions failing with response code 43 (failed by counter: timeout). Fujitsu investigation found the
failure was due to a crash of a connection blade pi11pbx9002-CB2 in Brocade VDX2730 switch at
approx. 09:32. The switch issue was raised with hardware support.
Issue within Fujitsu's domain (ATOS Ref: 110098875 / Fujitsu Ref: A15162811, A15162813
A15162900).

not have visibility of when these expire but all are expected to do so by December 31* 2017. The Post
Office ability to deliver files to these PODG endpoints is at risk. Fujitsu have raised a proactive Change
Request into the Post Office to urgently complete a feasibility study and provide mitigation options.
The below will be raised as a Risk so there is no number at the time of writing this report.

> Gold Build - Tidy Up exercise - The counters without the latest keys are now generating thousands of
monitoring events as they attempt to connect to the Fujitsu Data Centre. The only way to stop these
events is to fix the VPN Certificates on these counters or switch these counters off. The mitigation is to
request that the Post Masters at these Branches switch these counters off. Atos will be requesting an
MBS be sent to the identified Branches via the Post Office Communications team. If the counter is still
required a base unit swap should be requested via the Atos Service Desk.

24.8 Performance Summary - Ingenico

Supplier Highlights
» Ingenico have continued to achieve all of their SLA’s for February.

Service Performance

» All SLA’s were met for February with Grade of Service achieving 87.3%.

» The Abandonment Rate has increased slightly this month to 0.8% but remains within SLA.

» The total number of Paystation transactions in February was 2,584,216 with the value of these
transactions amounting to £40,425,930.71.

Incidents

> There were no High Severity Incidents for Ingenico in February 2017.

> On 11" February 2017, Ingenico performed maintenance at their datacentre to significantly reduce the
probability of further high-severity Firewall Failover Incidents.

Problems

» P9788812 - Opened in relation to the non-receipt of POPB files. While files not received will almost
always process successfully the following day, the Root Cause is still unknown.

> A Change was implemented by Ingenico on 2™ February 2017, which appears to have resolved the
issue.

Service Desk

» The percentage of calls answered at the Paystation Helpdesk was 87.38% in February, meeting the
target of 80%.

» Call volumes to the Ingenico Helpdesk reduced to 1600 from 1899 in January. However, it should be
noted this is likely the result of February being the shortest month of the year.

Orders

» Stock availability continues to be monitored closely. The volume of orders for new equipment regularly
exceeds Ingenico’s recommended limit of 45 orders per month, and in February there were 46 placed
(45 in January).

> The overall Failure Rate, relating to all components and peripherals of the Paystation, had increased to
518 in January. However, this figure reduced significantly to 394 in February.

Complaints

» Two complaints were received by Ingenico in February, both relating to the limited lifespan of
Paystation equipment (a symptom of its age). These complaints have been dealt with by ordering and
installing replacement equipment, and explaining the situation to the affected Postmasters.

Service Improvements

» The wider Post Office business has expressed an interest in understanding more about the purpose of
the various files sent between parties for Paystation. A presentation has been prepared for circulation
within the Post Office, and will also be shared with the SISD Service Desk to improve Agents’
understanding.

Paystation Service Post March 2017
» The Solution for the new Paystation Service has been provided to the Post Office for sign off. If
approved, this will see Ingenico retained as the Service Provider.

24.9 Performance Summary - Interchange

Supplier Highlights
» A good service reported for the Galaxy system with three Severity 4 Incidents handled within SLA.

Service Performance

» There were only three Severity 4 (lowest classification) Incidents reported during this period.
> No issues reported with server performance.

Risks and Issues

> A Risk remains with the connectivity utilised by Interchange for remote support of the server located
in the Swindon Stores communication room. Interchange use two ADSL lines. As part of the Galaxy
server relocation project (to move Post Office servers, including Galaxy from the Royal Mail building to
the Post Office building) and the network separation project, the ADSL lines should also have been
moved or new ones installed. They currently are still routed into Royal Mail and patched over to Post
Office. The strategy will be to include as part of a 3rd Party remote connectivity service, still to be
deployed. This issue has been raised with Ian Robertson (the Post Office).

Service Improvements

» There were several outstanding bug fixes that required user testing. A test pack was signed-off and
the testing was completed.

> As part of the Separation Project Interchange were commissioned to make a change to stop Royal Mail
staff from accessing Post Office stock and vice versa. This Change has been coded but a bug identified
which was fixed some time ago. The user acceptance testing has still to be completed so the
implementation can be finalised.

» There is a requirement to improve the calculation frequency for the revision of price changes. On-going
discussions are in progress to automate the calculation which is currently undertaken annually. This
will benefit the business with up to date charges improving the financial position. All coding has been
done and user acceptance testing done, just waiting for James Vowles to set up an account for Simon
Peacock (the Post Office) to have a demo. However, Simon Peacock does not want this implemented in
the current financial year.

24.10 Performance Summary — NCR (PDA and Scanners)

Service Performance

> All Service Levels and KPIs were met in the month of February.

> In the month of February SLA 1 was once again achieved (80% of calls to be handled within 20
seconds). 100% of calls were answered within 20 seconds.

> The Service Desk saw a 11% decrease in calls this month. The call volumes continue to be low with
the desk only receiving a total of 15 calls in February. This is a 68% reduction year on year.

» Call Abandon rate was at 0% versus the 5% target. In the last 12 months the call abandonment rate
has been at this level (0%) 11 out of 12 months.

Issues

» SOTI Server Migration - When (Barcode/Post Office/CSC/SOTI) performed the migration of the SOTI
environment from the Royal Mail domain into the Post Office domain earlier this year. The Barcode
Warehouse established that the devices would not connect to SOTI. This therefore meant that any
PDA's that are swapped out were unable to connect to SOTI to receive updates. Work has been
ongoing and a manual workaround was put in place. Mark Butler (Post Office) has successfully tested
the manual SOTI agent upgrade in Eastbourne. It now remains to be decided if POL is happy to carry
out this activity themselves or whether they require The Barcode Warehouse to assist.

Incidents and Swap-outs

> In February we saw a decrease in Incidents relating to PDA’s, with a total of 16 Incidents versus 20
last month. 14 of the Incidents required a swap out.

» PDA Swap outs - all were completed shipped before 4pm same day, achieving 100% again this month
for PDA/printer swap outs.

> Of PDA faults reported, the top fault categories in this period once again were application, and issues
with the operating system. No specific trends were identified.

» Repairs - the PDA repair and return to stock within 10 working days achieved KPI target this month at
100%

> There were no Incidents raised for scanners this month.

» There were no repairs reported this month beyond economical repair (BER).

Spares
> No issues with spares reported by the Supplier during February.

for a CE to attend and then the performance will be monitored for the following 12 weeks. If the

remains above the threshold a further month of monitoring will occur before deciding whether to
schedule another visit - the tracker below reflects up to and includes June.
