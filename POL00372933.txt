Hi Angela
This is the document I've pulled together regarding the options.
Hope this is ok.

Thanks

Gayle,

We've received an invitation for a meeting tomorrow on Detica which I don't feel is necessary given where
we are on the Horice v Detica scenario. So could you give me the comparison info you have been working on
so that I can finally conclude this.

Thanks
_Angela.
