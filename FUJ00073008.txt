I} Response :

lrrom the call log it seems that the transactions in question had been done on
counter 4. The update on 11/12 at 15:42 says that counter 4 was not
Jcomunicating.

this would cause the transactions that had been done on c
missing’ on the reports done on any of the other counters.

[the call text also says that the rmn has recified the situation. Therefore I
am not sure why this call has been sent to SSC.
