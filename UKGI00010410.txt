Dear All,

Please see below a short readout of Kelly’s meeting with Al Cameron this afternoon:
Meeting with Interim CEO for POL

Kelly Tolhurst
Al Cameron
Private Secretary

e Kelly explained how she came to her decision and made clear that it was no reflection on the progress and
achievements Al has made while taking on the interim role.
e Kelly spoke about how she has challenged POL a lot over the past few months and how she has been impressed

with Al's work. Specifically how he dealt with the outgoing CEO and stepping up to the challenges both
internally and externally to POL.

e Kelly explained how she hopes Al will stay on within POL but recognises that he will still be digesting the
decision. She acknowledged his work as CFO particularly on the litigation and bringing the business into a profit.

e Al thanked Kelly for taking the time to meet him in person. Al said that he was obviously disappointed but
acknowledged Kelly’s point that it was a difficult decision to make. He said it was slightly relieved to not have

the full responsibility for the GLO as he is concerned about the outcomes. Kelly noted his concerns and thanked
him again for his work as interim CEO.

e Al thanked Kelly for how she has worked with POL. He added that she has challenged them a lot of the time but
her engagement, drive and interest in POL has been much appreciated.

e Finally, Al added that he looks forward to working with Nick and will be open to whichever role he sees fit for
him when the time comes in September.

Many thanks,
Jess

Call with the Chair of POL RE: CEO Recruitment

Tim Parker

Kelly Tolhurst
Carl Creswell
Private Secretary

e Kelly talked Tim through how she met with all of the appointable candidates last week and explained how she
came to her decision to appoint Nick. She touched on each of the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate,
justifying her decision.

e Kelly explained her enthusiasm for Nick to drive the change within POL that she is looking for. She added that
she acknowledges the risks of going with someone external.

e Tim said he agreed that Nick is a great candidate and explained how he wants to get the best possible outcome
for the Post Office. He touched on how he will work with Nick to get on with the job in hand.

e Kelly touched on how she thinks this is a great opportunity to transform the business, Tim agreed.

e Kelly explained how she hopes that Al will stay on as CFO following the decision and when she meets with him
later today will express her gratitude for the work he has done while interim CEO. Tim agreed this was a good
approach.

e Tim explained the importance of the chairman being on board with the decision and to create the right
messaging that he will work to make sure he feels welcome when he arrives in September. Kelly agreed this
was a sensible approach.

e Kelly said she will give Tim an update after she meets Al this afternoon. Tim said he will speak to Al too.

Hi Alex,
We’re aiming for Thursday and POL, UKGI and BEIS are putting comms plans in place.
Your office will probably be passing you the update I sent them earlier.

Key points were:
- the terms are with Nick Read for agreement;

- we are working towards Thursday as the date for announcement and are in contact BEIS/UKGI/POL to agree press
lines;

- POL are checking how to sort the issue about needing ‘Board approval’ prior to the announcement. Following my
conversation with you on Monday, POL and UKGI are exploring how to get this resolved outside of a formal meeting,
if needed;

- POL plan to announce it internally at around 10am on Thursday, ahead of issuing a press notice at 11am;

- Kelly has agreed to speak to Tim Parker (tomorrow am), as he has requested, and to Al (following her chat with Tim —
UKG1I00010410
UKGI00010410

date tbc).
Sorry for not copying you in directly. We are working hard to land it on Thursday.

Thanks,
Carl

It could possibly be done that way but all the other appointments we’ve done have gone to a regular Board meeting.
The Articles would need to be checked.

But I doubt the company will want to convene a special Board meeting for this given there’s a Board meeting already
scheduled in the next 2 weeks.

It sounds like what matters here is that its announced soon and that should be perfectly possible. Tom A is on the case
and will come back to us on the logistics.

Hi Tom,
Sorry to be a pain, but can you clarify why it can’t be agreed by correspondence or a call rather than in
the scheduled Board meeting, please? Alex said earlier that he thinks we should press to get all the

approvals in place before the announcement (which needs to be in the next few days).

Thanks,

We can’t avoid a Board meeting to make the appointment formally.

But that doesn’t mean Nick’s name can’t be announced earlier if everybody is comfortable. That’s what
we'll aim for per my email yesterday

It would really help to understand why the Spads are in such a hurry. I understand about 23rd July - is
there anything else?

Hi Tom,
Many thanks for the update on this! That sounds positive.

Following a conversation with Alex earlier, I have asked Tom A to see whether
POL’s Board definitely needs to sign off the appointment — and if so whether they
can do that by correspondence or a conference call (so that it can happen ahead
of the announcement).

During our separate meeting with Kelly earlier, the Minister told me and Tom A that
she is happy to talk to Tim about next steps (probably tomorrow) and then meet Al
(perhaps Thursday) for a face-to-face chat. She is comfortable about what she
would say and completely agrees with the approach you've suggested.

Special Advisers are pressing to get the announcement delivered quickly. Kelly
understands that we need a bit of time to line up the POL internal and external
comms, but we need to keep pressing POL to get it all signed, sealed and
delivered as soon as we can.

Copied to Jess and Tom A in case they have anything to add.

Thanks,
Carl.

White,

Nick Read has agreed with Tim Parker that he would start the second week of September
which is positive. I’ve checked via RR that Nick has no notice period for his existing
commitments so they shouldn’t hold up an announcement.

We'll check the contract position with POL. I expect the appointment would be approved
by the Board at the next meeting on 30 July. Announcement should be possible well
before that (and before 23 July).

Beth (Better Regulation Executive)
Subject: Re: Post Office CEO

Hi all

To confirm that I agree with Minister and Carl that we should press on with an early
announcement for the reasons Carl gives. Obviously that does depend on
successful agreement on terms, though as these advertised and presumably
contract ready to sign I would hope this could be done quickly. We were told at
interview feedback session that Nick could be available to start quickly which is a
plus.

On the calls, I think it would be great if the Minister could make time on Monday to
speak on phone with Tim and then Al, for the reasons and on the basis Tom sets
out. She will want to hear that Chair fully committed to working with chosen CEO
and also Tim’s suggestion for how to handle call with Al. With Al it would be very
useful to have him stay on as CFO, even for a few months, and if a call from

UKG1I00010410
UKGI00010410
minister would help swing this, worth doing. (Il am also available as back-up if
necessary).

Thanks all and let's try to get this all lined up for early next week.

Enjoy your weekends

Hi Tom,

I agree with Jess that we should test Kelly’s views on whether to make the calls on
Monday.

Before she were to call Al, it would be good to know how Tim’s call with him went.

On the timing issue, I think we should keep up the pressure for an early
announcement. In my experience these appointments are often announced
subject to contract. The chief reasons for haste are to put an end to the
uncertainty, to minimize the risk of it leaking but also to ensure that it happens
before there is a change over of PM and the potential arrival of new Ministers.
Kelly has said she would like it to happen while she is in post and able to deal with
any questions that arrive (i.e. rather than leaving any successor having to handle
it, at a time when they will have lots of other priorities). I hope that Kelly will stay
but I think her logic on this is sensible.

Copied to Alex, who may have views in light of his own discussions with Kelly and
Tim.

Thanks Jess
This isn’t about changing minds. The purpose of the calls are:

- Kelly to Al. To give him some background on the decision, to say that we know
he makes a big difference to the business, and to say that while we know the
decision will come as a disappointment to him that we hope he will stay on as CFO
of the company hopefully forming a strong working relationship with Nick Read.

- Tim to Kelly. I think Tim probably wants to let Kelly know that he accepts the
decision and has moved on ie he is committed to the Post Office and will world
positively with Nick Read.

Hope that’s ok.

Hi Tom,

Thank you for passing this on. I have copied in Beth and Eleanor as I

understand Carl is away today.

I think it is worth noting that as Alex told Tim when he spoke to him earlier in
the week, Kelly is very firm with her decision. Kelly will want to know if the
request to speak to Al would be for Tim/Al to try and change her mind? Can I
also check if Tim has spoken to Nick since getting back to the UK?

Happy to ask Kelly next week if she is happy to speak to both Tim and Al, we
have the meeting on the Long-Term Vision first thing Monday so I think this
will be a good opportunity.

Thanks,

I just spoke to Tim Parker who called me.

Tim says there is a desire to make the announcement next week. In the
normal scheme of things you would announce this when the candidate has
agreed the contract which usually takes some time. Is there a particular

reason for needing to move more rapidly in this case?

UKGI00010410
UKGI00010410
We also talked about Al Cameron and Tim also thinks it could make a
difference if the Minister would speak to him. Clearly such a call would be

better before an announcement.

Finally, Tim asked if we could arrange a call between him and the Minister. I

think this is to confirm his commitment to carrying on as Chair.

Jess - please could you contact Tim to arrange a call with Tim and ask if Kelly

would be willing to speak to Al Cameron?
