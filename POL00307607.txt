Subject: Horizon access

Attachments: Document1.docx; Horizon access cases.docx

In anticipation for our call tomorrow I wanted to send you, before passing to FJ, what I thought I might send round in
advance of tomorrow’s meeting. Grateful for comments.

Dear all
In advance of our call (time/date) I thought it might be helpful if I set out what I think we need to discuss. I am referring
to the issue in question as ‘Horizon Access’ as a catchall for what may be a number of related matters.

The issue of access to Horizon data has arisen again in relation to two cases in the Scheme on which Second Sight have
completed a report. We anticipate that there will be more as Second Sight maintain a spreadsheet of what they consider
to be ‘themes’ one of which is entitled ‘Transactions or Transaction Corrections not entered by the Sub-postmaster or
staff ‘and shows this issues has been referenced in 50 cases.

What I would like to achieve on the call is:

1. Acommon understanding of what is and is not possible in relation to Horizon

2. In light of 1, above, whether we have in the past used the right terminology when explaining what can and
cannot happen

3. What we should say in each of the cases before us at the moment in response to what Second sight has said in
the draft CRR, and

4. How should we deal with this matter going forward to ensure we have a robust statement we can stand behind
and close the matter down as far as we are concerned.

attach for information:
a) The Spot Review 5 extract from Second Sight’s interim report (Doc1)

b) Relevant extracts from each the two cases referred to above — the application, PO’s investigation report and
Second Sight’s draft report
