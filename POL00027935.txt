EPOSS records Transactions to the Riposte message store. These are
replicated by Riposte to the message stores on file servers at the Data Centres.
The TMS Agents extract and reformat Transaction data and present it for further
analysis, summarisation and forwarding by the host database application.

Cash, cheque and voucher methods of payment are handled by EPOSS. For
payment using a debit card, EPOSS (from the settlement menu) initiates Debit
Card to obtain authorisation of payment.

APS is a generic application that enables Post Office to provide a range of bill
payment and pre-payment services to the customers of many Post Office Clients.
APS provides transaction facilities at the counter, integrated into Customer
Sessions using facilities provided by EPOSS. APS also supports transfer of data
to and from Post Office Client systems and Post Office systems. APS is available
at all Counter Positions in all Branches.
