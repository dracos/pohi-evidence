POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF RAYMOND GRANT

|, Raymond Grant, Former Employee of Post Office Limited as an Investigation

Manager, will say as follows ...

4. | make this statement in response to a request for information pursuant to
Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 —- Request number 1, regarding matters
falling within Phase 4 of the Inquiry: action taken by Post Office Ltd against
Sub-postmasters dated 5 December 2023.

2. | have been provided with a number of documents relating to the Security
Team's role in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions, and in
relation to my involvement in the prosecution of William Quarm. The
documents provided to me are listed in the index to this statement.

3. 1 do not recall any detail regarding the statements and questions | have been
asked to provide information-on. There is no way | can clarify or provide any
detail to a case which was over 16 years ago. | have not worked in the
industry since leaving my post within the Post Office and hold no records or

details of cases, policies or my employment to confirm specific details. | have

WITN10540100
WITN10540100

already articulated this information to several accredited lawyers via
telephone conversations who have advised me of my need to submit a
personal statement. The content of this statement is my entire recollection of
events relating to the interview | had with the Sub-postmaster at Lochmaddy
Post Office.

. | have been provided with the transcripts of the interview that took place
during my visit there some 16 years ago [POL00166910 and POL00166911].
| concur that these transcripts are an accurate record of the conversations of
that interview. In this interview the sub-postmaster made full and frank
confessions to having taken money from The Post Office to pay personal bills/
payments of various types and disguised this by producing inaccurate weekly
account figures by inflating the cash in hand figures. Also and perhaps key to
your enquiry that during this interview at no time was there any suggestion
that the Horizon Computer System had created any errors which could have
caused the resultant cash shortages.

. | cannot recall or remember if | was involved in any subsequent
correspondence with regards to the decision to prosecute the Sub-postmaster
concerned with this matter.

. Following this interview, | was awarded a redundancy package from Post
Office Limited and took no further part in the proceedings that led to the sub-
postmaster being prosecuted by The Crown Office and which led to a
successful prosecution and subsequent guilty verdict.

. In addition to this and in answer to all the other subsequent information you

have requested from me, | can say quite clearly that | have no recollection nor

Page 2 of 8
knowledge nor-any detaiis of any documents that will assist me to answer the

collection of questions that you raise in your requests.

Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this:statement to be true.
