               FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF RAYMOND GRANT




1, Raymond Grant, Former, Empioyee.of Post Office Limited as an Investigation

Manager, will say as.follr ws ._.



   1. I make this statement in response to a request for information pursuant to

       Rule 9 of, the inquiry Rules 2006 — Request number 1, regarding matters

       falling within Phase 4 of the Inquiry: action 'taken by Post Office Ltd against

       Sub-postmasters dated 5 December 2023.

   2. 1 have been provided with a number of documents relating to the Security

       Team's role in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions, and in

       relation to my Involvement in the prosecution of William Quarm. The

       documents provided to me are listed in the index to this statement.

    3. I do not.recell. any detail regarding the statements and questions. I have been

       asked to provide information on. There is-noway I can clarify or provide any

       detail to a case Which was. over 16 years ago. I have not worked in the

       industry.sinceleavin,g my post within the Post Office and hold no records or

                                                                                                    WI TN10540100




   already articulated this information to several accredited lawyers via

   telephone conversations who have advised me of my need to submit a

   personal statement. The content of this statement is my entire recollection of

   events relating to the interview I had with the Sub-postmaster at Lochmaddy

   Post Office.

4. 1 have been provided with the transcripts of the interview that took place

   during my visit there some 16 years ago [POL00166910 and POL00166911j.

   I concur that these transcripts are an accurate record of the conversations of

   that interview. In this interview the sub-postmaster made full and frank

   confessions to having taken money from The Post Office to pay personal bills/

   payments of various types and disguised this by producing inaccurate weekly

   account figures by inflating the cash in hand figures. Also and perhaps key to

   your enquiry that during this interview at no time was there any suggestion

   that the Horizon Computer System had created any errors which could have

   caused the resultant cash shortages.

5. I cannot recall or remember if I was involved in any subsequent

   correspondence with regards to the decision to prosecute the Sub-postmaster

   concerned with this matter.

6. Following this interview, I was awarded a redundancy package                         Post
                                                                                 from




   Office Limited and took no further part in the proceedings that led to the sub-

    postmaster being prosecuted by The Crown Office and which led to a

    successful prosecution and subsequent guilty verdict.

7. In addition to this and in answer to               the other subsequent information you
                                              all




    have requested          me, I can               quite clearly that I have no recollection nor
                                        say
