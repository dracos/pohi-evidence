Your Ref:

Dear Sir

REGINA -v- CARL EDWARD PAGE

I write further to our recent telephone conversation, which of course was in the context of this matter
being heard at Stafford Crown Court on 4 January 2005. I wonder whether you are yet in a position
to serve a copy of your expert’s report, to respond in relation to the proposed jury bundle and to
advise of any amendments required to the interviews.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully
