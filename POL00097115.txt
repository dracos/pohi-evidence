Subject: Update on the Horizon Case review following your meeting with JFSA and James Arbuthnot
Attachments:Draft Immunity Agreement (POL Working Draft) - 07.11.12.doc

Paula

This is an update on progress following your meeting with James Arbuthnot and Alan Bates regarding the review of
Horizon cases:

1. Post Office have reviewed the “immunity agreement” (drafted by JFSA) and created a revised version. (attached)
2. This revised version is with 2" Sight for comment, if OK with them we will send it to JFSA.
3. Our hope is that this will remove the JFSA reason for not sharing cases with us.

4. At this time, we don’t believe it necessary to publish an article in the subspace magazine to encourage more
sub-postmasters to come forward:

a. We already have 16 cases in the review

b. We expect the immunity agreement will allow JFSA to share the cases they tell us they have but haven’t
yet shared.

c. Wewill review our position on communications to sub-postmasters after we have discussed the
immunity agreement with the JFSA.

I will keep you informed as things progress.

Regards, Simon
