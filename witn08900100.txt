INTRODUCTION

       This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

       (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated the 8th

       September 2023 (the "Request").



BACKGROUND



      at Hallett & Co prior to joining the Criminal Law Team in 1989.

 2.   My main role as a senior lawyer in the Criminal Law team was to advise on

      case papers submitted by the Security Team and where prosecution was

      advised to conduct the case through to its conclusion. I would also deal with

      any other matter allocated to me by the Head of the Criminal Law Team. In

      November 1997! had a years maternity leave followed by a three year

             against prosecution which outweighed those tending in favour. One of the

             factors tending in favour of prosecution was the fact that suspects were

             usually in a position of trust. Any advice on prosecution would be sent to the

             Casework Manager who in turn would forward it to the decision maker within

             POL to authorise the prosecution.

     8.     I can say that POL00039945, POL00039951 and POL00039952 were

            policies that I reviewed. I would have been aware of the contents of the Post

           Office Internal Prosecution Policy (dishonesty) (December 1997)

           (POL00030659) and paragraph 3.3 of the Investigation and Prosecution

           Policy (March 2000) (POL00031012). The remaining documents came into

           being after I stopped working on "counter" cases. The author of the Post

           Office Internal Prosecution Policy (dishonesty) (December 1997)

           (POL00030659) document was Andrew Wilson and I am not sure to whom

           this document was circulated. In it, Andrew             ilson sets out the Post Office's

           prosecution policy, namely that acts of dishonesty in relation to the illegally

          acquiring of Post Office property or assets, or the property or assets of Past

          Office customers and clients while in Post Office custody would normally be

          prosecuted where this is deemed to serve the public interest. He

          recommended that a single point within the Personnel Department of each

          Business Unit should be the prosecution decision maker. In relation to

          Paragraph 3.3 of the Investigation and Prosecution Policy document

          (POL00031012). I would say that the reference to "in accordance with the

          criminal law" would include The Code for Crown Prosecutors. The Code for

          Crown Prosecutors was the key document followed when prosecution

          decisions were made. The other documents were published after I stopped

          doing "counters" cases.

       amendments necessary. I cannot now recall whether any such amendments

       were necessary. These documents would have been reviewed annually,

       usually by the Head of Criminal Law.

10.    In my time working for POL, I believe that in the main only theft or false

      accounting charges were considered. The Fraud Act ca me in shortly before I

      stopped doing "counters cases". The appropriate charge(s) would reflect the

      seriousness and extent of the offending as supported by the evidence. Rob

      Wilson reinforced the fact on numerous occasions that it was inappropriate to

      draft the charges in the alternative. I believe there was case law regarding

      this. The Code for Crown Prosecutors also indicated that prosecutors should

      not proceed with a more serious charge to encourage a Defendant to plead

      guilty to a less serious one. In relation to false accounting, I believe that there

      was a policy that prosecution would not be considered when the sum

      involved was less than £5000. This was on the basis that it was not in the

      public interest for such cases to be prosecuted. I believe this conclusion was

      reached following the courts imposing nominal penalties in such cases.

11.   The Criminal Law Team was led by the Head of Criminal Law who would

      allocate cases and any other work to the individual lawyers in the

      department. Lawyers would hold the position of lawyer, senior lawyer or

      principal lawyer. There were also two legal executives who would deal with

      Crown Court work and two secretaries. Up until 2006 all lawyers would

      undertake both "letters" and "counters" cases. In 2006 my role changed, and

      I was responsible for dealing with all "letters" cases in the Agents area. The

      remainder of the team advised on "counters" cases and "letters" cases in the

      office area. l retained conduct of the case of Carl Page.

                                                                                        W ITN08900100




 12.    In general terms the Criminal Law Team would advise on evidence and

        where appropriate draft charges. The decision to prosecute would be made

        by a designated decision maker. The person making that decision changed

        over the years. In the event that prosecution was authorised, summonses

       would be issued and either Agents or Counsel would be instructed to appear

       at the Magistrates court on behalf of POL. In an Agents area case, following

       committal proceedings the case was handed over to our Agents who would

       have conduct of the case. In office area cases Counsel would be instructed

       to draft the Indictment and advise on evidence. Conferences would be

       routinely held with Counsel to discuss both evidential and disclosure matters.

13.    Rob Wilson was responsible for supervising or reviewing the conduct of

       private prosecutions. Prior to Mr Wilson becoming Head of Criminal Law, Mr

       Heath would have had that responsibility.

14.    Mr Wilson would not have received any training but was an experienced

       prosecuting solicitor who had worked for POL for many years. The same

       applied to Mr Heath.

15.    Mr Wilson would expect any issues on cases to be raised with him. He would

       also see the post each morning and raise any concerns in correspondence

       with the lawyer. He would also periodically check files.

16.    There was no independent oversight exercised in relation to the conduct of

       prosecutions.

17:     1 am not aware that Post Office policy regarding prosecution of Crown Office

       employees differed from the policy and practice regarding prosecution of

       SPMs and their manage (assistants. This did not change whilst I

       conducted "counters" cases.

             document that I recognise as having previously seen and I did not

             have any input into the document.




             POL00104747 or POL00104777. Whilst working for POL I was unaware

             that there were bugs, errors or defects in Horizon.

             sight of the documents attached to Dave Posnett's email.

      IV.    I was not involved in the development management or amendment

             of the documents.

              Security Team. In the preamble to the Investigator's report there was a

              heading, "Identification Code".

       VII.   I was not aware of the "Identification Codes" document.

      VIII.   My understanding was that in the event of a conviction certain

              information was required by the police including the ethnicity of the

              person convicted.

20.   The Criminal Law Team did have input into the formulation of RMG/POL

      policies and guidance in relation to the applicable statutory provisions, codes

      of practice issued under statute, guidelines and guidance. This was normally

      undertaken by the Head of Criminal Law. The Security Team had a database

      that contained all their policies and I believe any new policy was either

      circulated to the investigators or they were advised that it had been added to

      the database. Policies on procedure e.g the conduct of tape recorded

      interviews, the completion of notebook entries etc were reviewed on a

      regular basis and the reviewing lawyers name would be on the document.

      From the documents I have had sight of I reviewed P0L00039945,

      POL00039951 and P0L00039952. l may have reviewed other policy
                                                                                             WITNO8900100
                                                                                           WI TN08900100




          documents of a similar nature but after the time that has elapsed I cannot

          give specifics.

  21.     I recall that as part of their training members of the Security Team took part

          in a mock trial. The case papers would contain numerous errors to highlight

          the importance of following the correct procedures. Junior counsel would be

         instructed to act as prosecuting and defence counsel and a member of the

         Criminal Law Team would play the part of the judge. Lawyers were also

         expected to highlight any problems in case papers and further training would

         be given by the Security Team to the investigators involved where this was

         deemed necessary.

 22.     When case                  submitted prosecution decisions were made if the
                     files




                             were




         lawyer considered the evidence contained therein was sufficient for such a

         decision to be made. Where further enquiries were needed to enable that

         decision to be made or for the public interest test to be property assessed the

         papers would be returned with a request for further evidence to be obtained

        or lines of enquiry to be made.



Process for prosecution and charging decisions



23.     Where the evidence was sufficient to afford a realistic prospect of success

        and it was in the public interest for a prosecution to ensue the lawyer would

        advise appropriate charges. The file would then be returned to the casework

        manager who would in turn forward it to the relevant person for authorisation.

        I can see from POL00030 59 that in 1997 the recommendation was that a

        single point within the Personnel Department of each business unit would
                                                                                         WITNO8900100
                                                                                       W ITN08900100




         make that decision. From POL00031012 it would appear that in 2000 the

         relevant person for authorising the prosecution was SIS. After the passage of

        time I can no longer recall who that person was. The person authorising the

        prosecution would be addressing the public interest test and would have had

        a copy of the Code for Crown Prosecutors. I was not working for POL on the

        dates that the remaining documents were published and can therefore not

        assist with the contents of those documents,

 24.    Prosecution and charging decisions in respect of SPMs, managers,

        assistants and Crown Office employees alleged to be responsible for

        shortfalls shown by data from the Horizon IT system were made by the

        lawyer who had conduct of the case. This did not change during the period

        that I was employed within the Criminal Law Team.

25.    Charging decisions were taken at the same time as prosecution decisions.

       This did not change during the period that I was employed within the Criminal

       Law Team.

26.    The legal advice would be given by lawyers in the Criminal Law Team and

       during the period I worked on POL cases I am unaware that this changed. A

       very small percentage of cases were sent to Counsel to advise on the

       sufficiency of the evidence and whether it was in the public interest to

       prosecute. These tended to be complex cases where it was considered that it

       would be helpful to have Counsel's input from the beginning. I can not recall

       this changing whilst I did POL cases.

27.    All lawyers were either barristers or solicitors. In addition to their legal

       training each lawyer, on joining the Criminal Law Team, would be supervised

        by other lawyers in the team for a period of up to two years to ensure that

        cases were properly advised on and that a consistent approach was taken.

 28,    Those involved in investigating a suspected offence would outline in the

        offender report the charges that they believed were supported by the

        evidence and any undermining material that existed. They would also

        highlight any matters that might impact on the public interest test, for

        example the ill health of the suspect. They did not have input into whether

        the test for prosecution was met.



The test applied



29.    Prosecution decisions were made in accordance with the Code for Crown

       Prosecutors namely whether the evidence was sufficient to afford a realistic

       prospect of conviction of a suspect on a criminal charge. In reaching a

       conclusion an assessment of the evidence would need to be made namely

       whether the evidence submitted was reliable, credible and admissible. Any

       evidence that undermined the prosecution case or assisted the Defence case

       would also need to be considered. In the event that this test was made out a

       decision would have to be made as to whether it was in the public interest for

       a prosecution to ensue. !n the event that there were public interest factors

       tending against prosecution which outweighed those in favour a decision

       would be made that it was not in the public interest for a prosecution to be

       brought. From memory cases where a decision was made that it was not in

       the public interest to prosecute usually involved the health of the suspect. I

       recall that it was agreed that it was not in the public interest for cases of false

  policy documents I have been asked to consider only POL00030659 had

  been published whilst I worked on "counters" cases. The author of this

 document was Andrew Wilson and I am not sure to whom it was circulated.

 From the content I would be surprised if it had been approved by a lawyer.

 The document is titled "POST OFFICE INTERNAL PROSECUTION POLICY

 (DISHONESTY)" and I have been asked to consider paragraph 5. It appears

 to be directed to the "letters" side of the business and despite its title,

 reference is made to offences of wilful delay of mail, opening mail and

 criminal damage, offences that do not involve dishonesty. It contains huge

 generalisations. Paragraph 5 states that, "in order to provide a deterrent and

 to serve the public interest it is clearly necessary to prosecute offenders in

the criminal category". No reference is made to the public interest factors set

out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The conclusion that offenders in the

"irresponsible" and "irrational" categories would not be prosecuted did not

reflect the position regarding the types of offences
                                                   s that were prosecuted on
the "letters" side of the business. This is not a document that lawyers took

into consideration in deciding whether a prosecution should take place.

        decision to prosecute was made in complex cases. I cannot recall the

        position changing during the period I advised on POL cases.

The conduct of prosecutions



33.    The following legislation, codes and principles governed the conduct of POL

       prosecutions:- the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued under section 10 of

       the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 gave guidance on the general

       principles to be applied when making decisions about prosecutions, the

       relevant statutes and case law set out the actus reus and mens tea of a

       particular offence and how to prove it, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act

       1984 dealt with police    wers of investigation, the Criminal Procedure and

                                         Page 13 of 50

                                                                                       W ITN08900100




        Investigations Act 1996 set standards to regulate the investigation process

       and the recording and retention of material found or generated during the

       course of an investigation together with Codes of Practice, POL00030659

       sets out the fact that the usual course was to prosecute all breaches of the

       criminal law by employees which affect the Post Office and which involve

       dishonesty. POL00031o12 refers to the fact that the prosecution guidelines

       of the business will be used in making any decision to proceed under criminal

       law. Where prosecution was advised this was in accordance with the Code

       for Crown Prosecutors.

34.    England and Wales were divided into office and Agent areas. With the

       exception of a minority of office area cases Counsel were instructed by

       lawyers in the Criminal Law team from the first hearing in the magistrates

      Court to the conclusion of the case. In a minority of cases Counsel were

      instructed to advise on the sufficiency of evidence and whether it was in the

      public interest for charges to be brought, In Agents cases, if my recollection

      is correct, lawyers in the Criminal Law team would advise on charges and

      evidence and would prepare the committal bundle. Agents would be

      instructed from the first hearing in the magistrates court and after committal

      proceedings would take over the conduct of the case in the Crown court

      which would include instructing counsel and drafting the Indictment. In

      complex cases the Criminal Law team would retain Agent area cases and

      use Agents to attend Magistrates court hearings only. I am not aware that

      this changed.

Disclosure




35.    I do not believe that the purpose of the prosecution policy documents at

       paragraph 7 above were aimed at the disclosure obligations on the

       Prosecution. The Intranet would have had policy documents on disclosure

       and the completion of the forms. These documents would have been

       reviewed by a lawyer.

36.    1 believe a policy document regarding disclosure from third parties would

       have also been on the intranet.

37.    My understanding of the disclosure obligation on POL as prosecutor was to

       disclose to the accused any material which might reasonably be considered

      capable of undermining the prosecution case or assisting the case for the

      accused which had not previously been disclosed. The duty of disclosure

      was an ongoing one throughout proceedings and involved the disclosure of

      relevant material. The duty of disclosure imposed an obligation for

      investigators to pursue all reasonable lines of enquiry whether they pointed

      towards or away from the suspect. The disclosure officer would prepare

      schedules of unused material which would be served on the Defence with the

      committal papers. Copies of the material listed would be provided unless the

      volume of the material was vast. Copies of any material that were considered

      to undermine the prosecution case or assist the Defence would always be

      copied. When a Defence statement was received a copy would be forwarded

      to the disclosure officer and Counsel to ascertain whether further material

      needed to be obtained. A conference would normally be held with Counsel to

      discuss the Defence statement and disclosure.

                                                                                        W ITN08900100




 38.    1 believe that in the majority of cases the lead investigator would hold the role

        of disclosure officer in relation to private prosecutions brought by POL,

 39.    The person who held the role of disclosure officer would also usually be the

        lead investigator. They would have received training from the training

        department. Where there were changes in legislation and guidelines, the

        security department and training wing would be informed, policy documents

       would be amended and circulated to all investigators.

40.    Whilst I was employed by POL I would have reviewed the disclosure in every

       case from when the file was submitted to the conclusion of the case. If my

       memory is correct in Agents cases, the Agents instructed would take over the

       conduct of the case in the Crown Court. Up to the point that that happened

       disclosure would be my responsibility.

41.    The person(s) holding the roles of investigation officer, officer in charge

       and/or disclosure officer did not make decisions about the conduct of

       prosecutions.

42.    After the passage of time it is difficult to recall advice that was given to

                                                                                        W ITN08900100




        should be sought. In Crown court cases a conference would usually take

        place where both evidence and disclosure would be discussed.

 43.    Where the integrity of the Horizon IT system was being challenged the

        investigator would be asked to obtain any relevant data/ information from

        Fujitsu. At the time I conducted POL cases I was unaware of any bugs or

        defects in the system and believed that Horizon was a robust and reliable

        system. Dr Jenkins, in his expert witness statement would have asserted that

        and as an expert would have been under a duty to disclose any information

        that undermined that position.

44.     After committal proceedings or a transfer to the Crown Court Counsel would

        be instructed to draft the Indictment and advise on evidence and disclosure.

        in Agent area cases Counsel would have been instructed by our Agents.

45.    Counsel who were instructed to prosecute were familiar with Horizon. When

       Horizon was initially installed in offices, Counsel and Agents who were

       regularly instructed on POL cases attended a training day where they were

       shown how entries were physically made onto Horizon and how the system

       worked. The witness bundle would have contained a statement regarding the

       operation of Horizon.

46.    Having reviewed the Defence statement, it would have been forwarded to

       both the disclosure officer and Counsel I would have given advice regarding

       the areas that needed to be addressed. A conference with Counsel would

       usually take place to discuss the Defence statement. If further disclosure was

       triggered a further schedule of unused material would be prepared and

       served on the Defence.

 47.        Other than the case of Carl Page I cannot now            any other case I dealt




                                                            recall
            with where a discrepancy was attributed to problems with the horizon IT

            system in the Defence statement. Pension and Allowance order books were

            still in existence up to 2003 and as such many of the cases up to that time

            would have involved the wrongful encashment of orders from those books.

            Cases solely involving a discrepancy between Horizon generated cash and

            stock and the actual physical position determined following an audit

            increased after order books were phased out. In such cases the Defence

            statement would be forwarded to Dr Jenkins who would, if necessary, make

            a further statement addressing the issues raised. Were Dr Jenkins aware of

            any information which would undermine his evidence he had a duty to inform

            the prosecutor who would in turn have to disclose such information to the

            Defence. The disclosure officer would also be asked to look into any matter

            raised and obtain any relevant material. I cannot now recall whether ARQ

        logs were always requested from Fujitsu.

48.    At no time that I dealt with POL cases was I aware of any potentially relevant

        the meaning and importance of the expert's declaration. The statements

        were obtained by the investigators. Dr Jenkins statement included the words

        "I understand that my role is to assist the court rather than represent the

        views of my employers or Past Office Ltd". The words are self-explanatory.

        My recollection is that when Horizon was rolled out the Head of the Criminal

        Law team instructed Counsel to advise on the expert evidence that would be

        required and what the statement needed to cover. I believe Fujitsu were then

        asked who in their company would be able and willing to provide that expert

        evidence. I do not know what instructions were given. As far as I recall only

        Dr Jenkins provided an expert witness statement in cases I dealt with.

 50.    I cannot recall any policies or guidelines in place regarding the provision of

       evidence by employees of Fujitsu whilst I worked in the Criminal Law Team.

 51.   At the time I believed that Dr Jenkins was the ultimate expert on Horizon. It

       did not occur to me that there could be a potential conflict of interest. I do not

       recall a challenge ever being made by the court or the Defence regarding the

       use of Dr Jenkins as an expert witness. His role was to provide objective,

       unbiased opinion on matters within his expertise to assist the court and not

       the prosecution.

       criminal enforcement proceedings.

 55.   As above. As I did not deal with criminal enforcement proceedings i am not

       familiar with the Financial Investigation Unit process documentation

       (POL000B4988 and POL00084989) which was appended to the 2009

       "Former Subpostmaster End to End Debt Review" (POL00084977), as well

       as POL00051382



Audit data from Horizon to support investigation, prosecution and I or other

legal proceedings




56.    1 cannot recall what the contractual requirements on Fujitsu were. I am aware

       that there were limits on the number of ARQ requests which could be made

       without additional costs being occurred. I do not know how any requests

       above the limits were dealt with or charged but this would not have been

       factor taken into consideration in deciding whether such documentation

       should be obtained. I was not working for POL when Horizon online was

       introduced, I had no role in obtaining audit data. I do not know who

       authorised an ARQ request. I cannot recall who from Fujitsu was responsible

       for the provision of this data or how the data was presented. I do not know of

       any additional prosecution support Fujitsu was contractually obliged to

       provide.

 60.    I have considered the documents set out at i) to xii) namely The Case File

        Events Log at POL00093908, the records of interview from 14th January

        2003 at POL00093702 (commencing at 17:17) POL00093701 (commencing

61.    1 first became involved in the case involving Cars Page and John Whitehouse

       when the investigation file was submitted to the office. Mr Wilson will have

       allocated the case to me to deal with. Unusually he made the decision that

       he would be the second lawyer on the case. His role included being familiar

       with the evidence, considering disclosure and attending conferences with

       Counsel,

62.    My knowledge and understanding of the initial investigation was that H.M

       Customs & Excise suspected Mr Whitehouse of money laundering. I am

       unaware whether any audits were carried out by H.M Customs & Excise

      although I can say that an audit of the Post Office was not undertaken by

      H.M Customs & Excise.

61    My Understanding is that Staffordshire Major Crime Unit were called in by

      N.M Customs & Excise after officers from H.M Customs & Excise arrested Mr

      Whitehouse as he attended a Bureau de Change facility. He had in his

      possession 585000 euros and a receipt from Rugely Post Office dated that

      day for a bureau transaction for £360000 worth of Euros at an exchange rate

      of 1.62. Post Office investigators attended Staffordshire Police HQ facility to

      liaise with CI Mark Abbotts and his team (POL00093908 Case File Events

      Log). Mr Page was arrested by the police who conducted a search of the

      Post Office and subsequently conducted a short interview with him that

      evening. Post Office investigators were present at the search to point out

      items that should be seized. A police officer was present at a second

      interview, with Mr Patel being the lead interviewer. On the 14th January 2003,

      at a meeting with officers from Staffordshire Major Crime Unit Post Office

      investigators agreed that the Post Office would take charge of the

      investigation and any resulting prosecution, with the police assisting with the

      financial investigation and undertaking phone analysis.

64.   1 have considered POL00045921, a letter from Staffordshire Police to Mr

      Whitehouse dated the 7th' May 2003. 1 am unaware of any discussions that

      took place with the police before a decision to charge Mr Page and Mr

      Whitehouse was made. I was somewhat surprised by the conclusion of the

       police not to press charges on the basis that their enquiries had "not provided

       any clear evidence of criminal conduct either by, or between, the two men'®

       given that the police had not conducted the investigation but had passed it to

       the Post Office to do so. I do not know when I became aware of the

       existence of this letter

65.    Stephen John made the charging decision in this case. Mr Page and Mr

       Whitehouse were jointly charged with conspiracy to defraud and Mr Page

      was additionally charged with theft.

66.   Stephen John was instructed to advise on whether there was sufficient

      evidence so as to afford a realistic prospect of the conviction of Mr Page and

      Mr Whitehouse and whether it was in the public interest for a prosecution to

      take place. His advice was that a conspiracy to defraud charge should be

      brought against Mr Page and Mr Whitehouse and a charge of theft against

      Mr Page.

67.   1 can no longer recall who authorised the prosecution of Mr Page.

68.   Mr Patel was the lead investigator in these proceedings. After 19 years I am

      not able to describe any discussions that I had with him during the course of

      this case. I can say that there were numerous conferences with Counsel

      where both evidence and disclosure were discussed.

69.   l cannot recollect whether any Horizon data was requested from Fujitsu in

      this case.

70.   1 have been asked to consider the report of David Liddell at POL00045867

      and his supplemental report at POL00045868. I would have become aware

      of these reports when they were served on the Prosecution. I have been

      asked to consider paragraph 2.7 of the first report. This was an extremely

                                   Page 25 of 50
                                                                                                W ITN08900100
                                                                                              W ITN 08900100




      complicated                   I have little memory of it. My recollection is that the




                    case




                           and
      Prosecution agreed that a surplus could not have physically built up in the

      "AM" stock or elsewhere. Mr Patel's schedules showed that all the euros sent

      to the Rugeley Post Office were entered into the Forde Moneychanger and

      were accounted for. I believe that this was the prosecution's case and

      therefore Mr Liddell's conclusion would not have undermined the basis of the

      theft charge against Mr Page. It was not considered that the timing

      differences set out in paragraph 2.8 of the first report could account for the

      alleged shortfall. The dates and times of the Euros deposited by Mr

      Whitehouse refuted this. Glyn Burrows in his statement at POL00093714

      outlines what he and his team did in conducting the audit. He explained that

      he would request an "office snapshot" printout from Horizon which provided a

      summary of all the cash and stock which should have been present at the

      office at that time together with a summary of all receipts and payments in

      relation to transactions conducted at the office since the beginning of

      business on the            January 2003. He explains that the process was then to

      verify the cash and stock actually on hand at the office to see if it agreed.

      There is no suggestion in his statement that data was verified back to source

      documentation.

71.   Mr Wilson, Mr John, Mr Tatford, Mr Patel and I were all responsible for

      ensuring primary and secondary disclosure was carried out. Stephen John

      was clear throughout that the Prosecution were to carry out disclosure

      correctly and not give blanket disclosure. He requested sight of all

      correspondence relating to disclosure and after discussion would draft the

      replies.

 72.    As previously stated after 20 years I cannot recollect the evidence that was

        relied upon by the Post Office.

 73.    Unfortunately, after the time that has elapsed, I cannot detail all the

        disclosure requests that were made by the Defence or how those requests

       were responded to. From the correspondence that I have had sight of it

       appears that all requests were addressed, material obtained and

       subsequently disclosed. The exception was material held by Customs which

       is addressed at paragraph 80 below.

74.    1 have been asked to consider the case conference note dated the 6th July

       2004 at POL00093910. 1 can say that I am not the author of this note. It is not

       my handwriting. I do not know whether I was present at the case conference,

       who was present and what was discussed.

75.    1 would have had no involvement in drafting the witness statements. The

       investigators obtained all the witness statements. I would have reviewed any

       witness statement taken.

76.    1 have been asked to consider a letter to Frisby & Co solicitors dated the 25th

       November 2004 (POL00067090). I cannot assist regarding the conversation

       on the 19th November 2004 referred to therein. It would logically relate to the

       service of an additional list of witness statements and exhibits in relation to

       the Notices of Additional Evidence previously served.

77.    I have been asked to consider the letter that I sent to Frisby & Co solicitors

       dated the 1st December 2004 (POL00067095). I cannot provide details of the

       recent conversation referred to.

78.    I have considered the letter from Frisby & Co solicitors dated the 25th

       January 2005 (PPOL00067097) and am asked whether I responded to this

       letter and the details of my response. I have no recollection of the letter and

       after some 18 years can not assist as to whether it was responded to. In the

       unlikely event that it was not Frisby & Co solicitors would clearly have chased

      a reply.

79.    I have been asked to consider the letter from Frisby & Co solicitors dated the

      23 May 2005 (POL00067110). I cannot recall details of any conversation

      with Mr Cleary. I cannot              the directions hearing and do not know

                                 recall




      whether contact was made with Mr Cottier.

80.   I have considered the letter from Frisby & Co dated the 26th May 2005

      (POL00067081) and my response dated the 27th May 2005 (POL00067084).

      I have no recollection of my letter dated the 24th May 2005 which preceded

      these letters. I cannot now recall my reaction to the observation made by

      Frisby & Co in the final paragraph but did not agree with their observation,

      Although I have no recollection of the visit, Stephen John, Rob Wilson and

      myself had attended H.M Customs & Excise headquarters and viewed the

      material. I can no longer recall what that material was. We concluded that the

      material did not fall for disclosure. Prior to the trial commencing the Defence

      agreed that HHJ W Wood QC would examine the material and decide

      whether it should have been disclosed. The material was brought to court

      and HHJ W Wood QC concluded that it was not disclosable.

81.   Stephen John was prosecution counsel. At some point, and I can not recall

         witness statements, exhibits, schedules and copies of material disclosed to

         the Defence, documentation including memos from Mr Patel,

         correspondence from the Defence solicitors, the Defence statements and

         experts report.

 82,     As detailed at paragraph 66 above Stephen John was instructed prior to

         charges being brought. There were numerous conferences at which

         evidence, disclosure, the Defence statements and the expert report were

        discussed.

 83.    l am not sure that I had a reaction. It was the jury's role to decide on the

        Defendants guilt or innocence.

84.     POL has always followed the guidance given by prosecuting counsel.

        Stephen John was of the view that it was in the public interest for a retrial to

        take place and the business agreed. My recollection is that Mr John was of

        the view that the prosecution case had come up to proof and in view of the

        amount alleged to have been stolen that a retrial was the appropriate course

       of action.

8.      I believe that Stephen John advised on the further evidence that should be

       obtained, transcripts of some of the evidence given in court were ordered,

       and disclosure triggered by the first trial, the second Defence statement and

       the expert report were considered.

86.    1 have considered the Defence statement in Mr Page's retrial at

       UKG100012306. At the time that it was received I would have been fully

       conversant with the evidence in this case. After the time that has elapsed

       have little independent memory of it. The Defencestatement at paragraph 2

       suggests that in the original trial the theft charge was related to the

  conspiracy to defraud charge. That was not and never was the prosecution

  case. When the office was audited following the arrest of Mr Page a number

  of cheques paid by Mr Whitehouse were found. Initially it appeared that they

  related to Bureau transactions conducted by Mr Whitehouse. Mr Page later

  admitted that Mr Whitehouse had given him a cheque in the sum of

  £278181.82 as three cheques used to purchase euros in December had not

  been honoured. He was holding the cheque pending error notices being

 issued. The prosecution's case was and remained that the £282000 audit

 shortage had been stolen over an unknown period of time by Mr Page. The

 snapshot printout of Mr Page's stock indicated that there should have been

 £72159.03 in cash and £282000 in currency. Investigations made by Mr

 Patel showed from accounting period week ending 28th August 2002 through

 to week ending the 8th January 2002 the figure declared for currency in the

 cash accounts had been inflated commencing with an inflated figure of

 £188000 and by the date of the audit reaching £282000, the amount shown

as foreign currency in Mr Page's stock. The inflated figures relied on the data

from the Forde Money changer. I can no longer recall what steps were taken

upon receiving the Defence statement although clearly it would have been

forwarded to Counsel and the investigator and consideration would have

been given to whether any further evidence or disclosure were required. I

cannot recall whether Dr Jenkins made a further statement. The theft charge

relied on the Horizon shortfall and at the time I believed, as did Counsel and

Trevor Lockey (the investigation officer who took over from Mr Patel), that Dr

Jenkins statement regarding the robustness and integrity of Horizon was

factually correct and could be relied on. I believed that Dr Jenkins would

       have disclosed any material which cast doubt on his opinion. I was also

       unaware of any bugs or problems with the Horizon data that had come to

      light in any other case.

87.   1 have been asked to consider the expert report of Mr Taylor at

       POL00061214. I can not comment on why Mr Page instructed a new expert.

88.   I have been asked about my view of the conclusion reached by Mr Taylor in

      his report. Had I believed his conclusions were correct, the prosecution of Mr

      Page would not have continued.

89.   i have considered the notification of disposal to police at POL00053308. I

      was surprised at Mr Page's guilty plea.

90.   In relation to POL00066519 I cannot explain why the memo was dated the

      31 July 2014,

91.   At the time I believed the case was fairly and competently conducted. I had

      no knowledge that there were any issues with Horizon. Had I been aware

      that there were bugs, errors and defects in the system that could, and did,

      cause discrepancies and shortfalls in branch accounts then prior to

      instructions being sent to Counsel enquiries would have been made to

      ascertain whether these could be excluded in relation to the Horizon data

      being relied on. Clearly were we not in a position to do this there would have

      been no basis for the prosecution of Mr Page on the theft charge. I have

      considered the Judgement of the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton &

      Others v Post Office Limited (2021) EWCA Crim 577 at POL00113278. Mr

      Whitehouse was never charged with theft. The case against Mr Page at both

      the first trial and the retrial was the same. In his case summary at the first

94.   I would have been allocated the case by Mr Wilson when it was sent to the

      Criminal Law Team for advice.

95.   1 have not seen the case papers for 18 years and therefore cannot say with

      certainty what exhibits and other documentation were enclosed with the

      investigation file.

96.   I can see from POL00044361 that 1 advised that the evidence was sufficient

      to afford a realistic conviction of Mrs Adedayo on charges of false

      accounting. In my view false accounting reflected the seriousness and extent

      of the offending. Mrs Adedayo had advised the auditors who were already

      present when she attended the office that the accounts would be about

      £50000 short. Mrs Adedayo subsequently handed the auditors a note that

          prosecution of Mrs Adedaya given the seriousness of the offences. Mrs

         Adedayo's actions involved a serious breach of trust aggravated by the fact

         that she involved her elderly assistant by informing her of what she was

         doing.

  97.    1 made the charging decision in this case.

  98.    After the passage of time I do not know who authorised the prosecution of

         Mrs Adedayo

  99,    Natasha Bernard was the lead investigator in this case.

100.     As indicated at paragraph 95 above, after 18 years I cannot say for certain

         what exhibits were contained in the file. The evidence relied upon would

         have been the handwritten admission made to the auditors, the audit

        shortage, the cash accounts and the admissions made at interview that Mrs

        Adedayo had falsified the cash accounts to hide the fact that she had

        borrowed money from the Post Office.

101.    I do not believe that any Horizon data was requested from Fujitsu in this

        case.

102.    Natasha Bernard was the disclosure officer in this case.

103.    My role would have been to ensure any material that may undermine the

        prosecution case or assist the Defence case was disclosed. This was a

        continuing duty.

104.    I have no recollection of any disclosure requests being made by the Defence

        in this case. I have not been provided with any correspondence from the

        Defence solicitors. Had any request been made, it would have been replied

        to.

105.   1 do not know who prosecuting counsel was in this case. Counsel was initially

       instructed to conduct the hearing at the magistrates court. Mrs Adedayo

       pleaded guilty at Chatham Magistrates Court on the 19th January 2006.

       Jurisdiction was declined. I do not know whether I or one of the legal

       executives instructed counsel to represent POL at the sentencing hearing.

106.   1 cannot recafi having any discussions with Counsel.

107.   1 do not know who made the decision to commence confiscation proceedings

       in respect of Mrs Adedayo.

108.   I had no involvement in the confiscation proceedings. I see from the Financial

       Investigation Events log (POL00047897) that I spoke to Michael Matthews

       regarding a prosecutors statement. I will have passed this to Mr Wilson to

       deal with.

116.   t was not involved in the prosecution of Susan Rudkin and therefore do not

        way the investigation and prosecution of Susan F2udkin was conducted or the

128.    Save for the prosecution of Carl Page l' did not advise on POL cases from

        2006 onwards. I was not aware of any issues impacting Horizon at the time

        that I had conduct of POL cases. Had I been aware that there were bugs,
                                                                                             WITNO8900100

         defects or any faults in Horizon then clearly a challenge to the integrity of

          Horizon in one case would be relevant to other ongoing or future cases. It is

         now clear that Horizon was not the robust system it was held out to be. In my

         view no proceedings should have been started unless the Post Office were

         able to prove that those bugs, defects or faults could not have impacted on

         the operation of Horizon i.e that the evidence being relied on was reliable.

129.     There are no other matters that I would like to draw to the attention of the

         Chair.
