Appendix 1

The interpretation of the question suggests we are using old terms for DMB colleague recruitment. We do not offer “historic”
terms for new joiners. They are contracted in the same way as all new POL joiners with up-to-date employment contracts,
and they are offered a salary based on an up-to-date transparent salary banding.

Any new DMB employee will be placed on the following pay rates by people support, this is full time and will be adjusted pro
rata for our part time colleagues.

They then enter the pay progression process which is an agreed process with the CWU which covers all colleagues. If the
colleague passes our competency assessment process successfully, they move on to the fully competent pay level.
