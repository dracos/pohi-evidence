Please can you advise on a response for Paula to send on her return.

Meanwhile, I’ll send a holding response (about her being abroad this week).

Thanks

Hello Paula,

Tam quite concerned about what I have been hearing recently about POL trying to change the scope of the
Scheme in order to restrict the terms of the investigation and stop certain matters being discussed. I should
make it clear that JFSA signed up to the details as were discussed and documented last July/August and
alterations to what was agreed will result in JFSA withdrawing from the Working Group and the Scheme.
Ido not know if you are aware of what is being proposed by the new POL members of the Working Group,
but from what I can glean it seems as if POL are trying to hijack the process which is something your Minister
assured me would not happen in her letter to me last September.

I would be grateful if you would look into what is happening at present. The impression I am getting seems
very different to the di i had last year.

Tam on my mobil if you want to call me today or tomorrow, hence the brevity of my note.
Alan
