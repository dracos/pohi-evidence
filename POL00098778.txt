, Simon Baker

for the MISRA case

Lesley,

Attached is my final Witness Statement for the Misra case. This was heard in Guildford Crown court in October
2010 and concerned West Byfleet Post Office.

Page 14 covers my response to a problem that had been identified in an earlier case (that involving Lee Castleton
who took POL to court for unfair dismissal which he lost).

Do you need me to dig out anything more on this? I think the key point is that the fact that Horizon did have bugs
has been discussed in court and POL still won the case.

Regards

Gareth
