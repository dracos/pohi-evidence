[ACCEPTANCE OF LIABILITY DISPUTED BY: POCL. ]

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:

36 APS transactions were incorrectly processed at the counter due to a hardware fault with the bar code
reader, which is currently being investigated by the manufacturer. (At this point it is not thought that this
problem is widespread as all other readers are working to specification). This resulted in customer account
details being retained in the ‘buffer’ and being allocated to the next payment. Whilst the receipt appeared
correct and the value was.allocated to the. correct Cash Account line, the information delivered to both TIP
and HAPS was incorrect.

The incident was first brought to the attention of ICL Pathway when the Outlet raised a call via the HSH
after the customer(s) had visited complaining of non-receipt of payment by the POCL client bearing a valid
receipt

ICL PATHWAY STATEMENT:

ICL Pathway now confirms that only 36 transactions are in error causing incorrect account allocation as
opposed to the 51 quoted in the initial submission. In addition, we feel that whilst genuine errors are in fact
chargeable, only the first 4 MER’s should attract the £150 charge as the incidents were brought to light by
the Outlet. The remaining 32 should attract only £100 each as they were advised to POCL via BIMS on 6
March.2000, and not advised by e-mail to ICL Pathway on 14 March 2000 as stated by POCL.

ICL. Pathway does not dispute liability for the incident itself, which is definitely attributable to a fault in the
Horizon system hardware. However we feel the 32 transactions notified by MER discovered by ourselves
following the incident raised by the outlet should only attract a charge of £100.

ICL Pathway accept liability for_4x£150 and 32x£100 = £3800

POCL STATEMENT:
There were 4 transactions reported to POCL /TP via the Outlet on the original BIMS report. (4 x £150.00)

On investigation in POCL / TP we discovered that there were in fact more of the-same errors and these
details were passed through to ICL Pathway via email on 14.03.00 for further investigation.

POCL do not believe that we would have been advised of these errors through the normal process otherwise
and consider these to be chargeable at 47 x £150.00 each.

POCL calculate that ICL Pathway is liable for 51x£150 = £7650

FINAL LIABILITY ASSIGNED TO: _I This has now been removed. 26/03/01
