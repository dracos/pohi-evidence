Subject: CASE NO 24676 - Prosecution of Ishaq

Rachael,

The case of Ishaq was committed yesterday from Bradford MC to Bradford Crown Court. The PCMH
has been scheduled for 4th September 2012 at 10.00 a.m.

The defendant's solicitor made it clear that the functionality of the Horizon system would be an issue.
The defendant has instructed them that the correct amount of money will be there in the accounts
somewhere and that there is an error with Horizon. "Everyone has heard about the problems with
Horizon!"

This is going to be another of those cases where we will have to anticipate and deal with the Horizon
issue and consider our approach.

Andy - I think we should draw up a separate list of cases in which we anticipate Horizon arguments

so that we can ensure that we have appropriate answers/ material and agreed tactics for the PCMH's

the dates of which will undoubtedly arrive well before the Post Office are likely to have obtained any
reports.

Martin.
