Subject: Second Sight Integrity Audit - Briefing

Duncan,

To give you a quick heads up on some developments with Second Sight audit. I had a call with Lesley this morning and
she advised that a provisional report will be released on the 8" July. The report is embargoed but the steer is that no
specific issues of a systemic nature have been identified with Horizon / HNGx but some noise is possible on a couple
of system bugs that were examined in the audit. Our team have looked at these and there is nothing that links these
to any specific cases so nothing to corroborate any allegations made.

POL’s thinking is that the report will be leaked before this meeting so we had a planning meeting today with our press
office / marketing / legal so everyone is briefed and we have an agreed plan. We will be keeping close to this over the
weekend and beyond and will advise of any developments.

Regards,
