THE POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

Second Witness Statement of Nick Read

on behalf of Post Office Limited in the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

1. 1, Nick Read, of 100 Wood Street, London, EC2V 7ER, say as follows:

Introduction
2. Iam Nick Read, Group Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) at Post Office Limited
(‘Post Office”). This is my Second Witness statement to the Inquiry. I have
aimed to include within this witness statement evidence relating to all matters
or issues detailed in the Rule 9 (61) Request insofar as the relevant facts are
within my own knowledge. The Rule 9 (61) Request sought evidence relating
to some matters or issues that are not within my own knowledge. In those
cases, to assist the Inquiry, I have been assisted by others within Post Office

whom I name where relevant.

3. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
“Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 24 July 2024

(the “Request’).

4. The facts in this witness statement are true, complete and accurate to the best
of my knowledge and belief. Where my knowledge and belief, as set out in this
witness statement, has been informed by another person or by documents that

I have reviewed, I acknowledge that person or those documents.

5. I have been assisted in preparing this witness statement by Burges Salmon
LLP and Fieldfisher LLP (together "BSFF"), who act on behalf of Post Office in

the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the "Inquiry").

Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (“ED&I”)

6. For the avoidance of doubt, at Post Office ED&I stands for Equity, Diversity and

Inclusion.

7. I have been asked to set out what significant changes have occurred in Post
Office’s ED&I policy and practices since the completion of the investigation and

Final Report “Project May” on 8 February 2024.

8. The Project May Report did not directly prompt any significant change to Post
Office's ED&l policies and practices. It was not the purpose of Project May to
review existing ED&l policies and practices at Post Office. Further detail on
Project May can be found in John Bartlett's Third Witness Statement

[WITN11190300].

WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

9. Nonetheless, Post Office’s ED&lI policies and practices have undergone

significant change as part of a wider ED&l improvement agenda.

10.Prior to 2020, Post Office did not have a focused and consistent ED&l strategy.
There was a restricted budget and a lack of diversity data and training. An
absence of clear strategic direction, coupled with low levels of trust in the Senior
Leadership Team (“SLT”) acted as barriers to achieving Post Office's ED&l

goals.

11.Since 2020, Post Office have adopted a strategic approach to drive impactful
change and to create a more inclusive culture. Post Office recognised the need
to go beyond simply raising awareness and instead have worked to implement
an effective ED&l agenda to drive and embed cultural change. I set out a

summary of key actions taken to achieve this below.

Development of Post Office’s ED&I Priorities

12.In November 2022, the Group Executive (now the Senior Executive Group,

“SEG”) consolidated Post Office’s ED&I priorities to focus its commitment to

drive change.

13.The ED&l priorities were identified as follows [POL00448662]:

Page 3 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

. The CEO will be accountable for Diversity and Inclusion in Post Office
and will appoint an executive sponsor with ownership for each Network

Group;

. Post Office will ensure there is no bias in the recruitment process and

will undertake a transparent process of audit;

. Post Office will take positive action that supports open career opportunity

and progression and will undertake a transparent process of audit;

. Post Office will commit to capturing and publishing diversity data,
including tracking our commitment to our 2024 targets of 14% ethnic
minority representation, 50% female representation, 5% disabled and

5% LGBT+ representation at levels up to SLP;

. Post Office believes that supporting equity in the workplace is the
responsibility of all leaders and line managers and will commit to

introducing EDI objectives for all People Managers;

Post Office commits to creating a respectful, inclusive work environment
within which every employee has the opportunity to make meaningful
contribution to the company’s vision and values, taking a zero-tolerance

approach to harassment and bullying; and

Page 4 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

g. Post Office will ensure that all elements of reward and recognition, from
performance development reviews to bonus and pay, are fair and will
report on this, and action taken to close the gap through our Ethnicity

and Gender Pay Gap Reporting."

14.This was an important step for Post Office and helped to focus the SEG and

senior leaders on driving forward the ED&l agenda.

15.The recommendations provided by Grant Thornton in their 2023 ED&I Audit
(the “ED&I Audit”) [POL00447900], which also contained an Inclusion Maturity
Assessment, have since broadened these aims.2 The ED&l Audit concluded
that Post Office was moving in the right direction but that, as an organisation,
Post Office were moving too slowly and it needed to accelerate its initiatives. In
particular, the results prompted Post Office to revise its recruitment processes

and enhance its consistency around ED&l.

16.A summary of the changes to Post Office’s recruitment processes following the

ED&l Audit are as follows:

a. We are now a Disability Confident Employer (Level 2) and have

introduced the requisite changes into our talent acquisition processes;

1 GE Report — Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Commitments [POL00448662].
2 ED&I Audit [POL00447900).

WITNO0760200

. Requests for reasonable adjustments are now included as part of our
application forms and there is the option for candidates to contact Post

Office prior to application so that reasonable adjustments can be made;

. Post Office has forged partnerships with third party organisations who
focus on attracting candidates from under-represented backgrounds.
Post Office has recently made its first hire via Northcoders; an
organisation that provides technical training to individuals from ethnically
diverse backgrounds and other under-represented groups such as those

with disabilities or those who identify as LGBTQ+;

. New interview guides are now made available in advance of interviews
for all colleagues and there are currently plans to publish these guides

externally on our new careers site to aid external applicants;

. Inclusive interviewing guidance is also now included as part of the ED&l

Inclusion Playbook (please see paragraph 20 for further detail and

[POL00448664);

Post Office have created a new interview best practice guide for hiring

managers which includes topics such as unconscious bias;

. Anew careers site is being developed and this will include a dedicated

ED&l page; and

Page 6 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

h. An ED&l statement is now included in all job adverts and promotion of

networks on external job boards such as LinkedIn, Reed and TotalJobs.

Charter Signatories

17.Post Office has been a founding signatory for the Race at Work Charter since

2018. Post Office is also a signatory of the Women in Finance Charter (since

2017) and BRC Diversity in Retail Charter (since 2022). Post Office is a

Certified Disability Confident Employer (since 2017) and has been a ‘Times Top

50 Employer for Women’ four times (2020-21, 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17).

Post Office has also been a member of the Safe Spaces programme since

September 2020.

ED&I Policies and Resources

18.Post Office has a suite of policies relevant to ED&l including:

a. An Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy (“ED&I Policy”) since 2019,

which was last updated in October 2023 [POL00448663];

b. AMenopause Policy in 2019;

c. A Transgender Equality Policy in 2019;

d. APregnancy Loss Policy in 2022;

Page 7 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

e. ADomestic Violence and Abuse Policy in 2023;

f. A Parental Loss Policy in 2024; and

g. AFamily Leave Policy in 2024.

19.These ED&lI policies strengthen Post Office’s support to its colleagues by

promoting a more inclusive and understanding culture.

20.The publication of Post Office’s Inclusion Playbook in November 2022
[POL00448664] was an important step for creating a more inclusive workplace.
The Playbook aims to assist both managers and colleagues to create an
inclusive culture at work. It provides information and practical examples and
covers a wide range of subjects such as ‘words to use and phrases to avoid’. It
is important within the organisation because it collates the information in one
place, acts as a reference point for fostering an inclusive culture and assists

colleagues with writing their ED&! objectives (see paragraph 23).

2

-Post Office’s ED&l hub was launched in January 2021 as a central repository
for ED&l material. Every employee has access and materials include: event
recordings, survey results, ED&l resource links, upcoming events, links to
policies and guidebooks, and information about Post Office’s employee ED&l

networks (see paragraph 29 below).

Page 8 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

22.A ‘Being a Good Ally Toolkit’ and a ‘Challenging Microaggressions Toolkit’ were

also launched in September 2023 during National Inclusion Week.

ED&I Accountability

23.Since April 2023, the SLT are expected to have an ED&lI objective. As of July
2024, the Performance Management Policy has been expanded and all
employees are now required to have one ED&l objective as part of their
Personal Development Review, which is measured and monitored throughout
the year [POL00448418]. This demonstrates Post Office’s commitment to
ensuring at all its people are engaged with and committed to furthering the ED&l

agenda within the organisation.

ED&I Monitoring

24.A Monthly Diversity Dashboard [POL00448658] was created in October 2020
to track current and trend data of Post Office employees. Post Office use the
Office of National Statistics codes for the collection and classification of ethnic

group data from employees.

25.The Diversity Dashboard is a graphic representation and summary of Post
Office’s Diversity Data. This is data that employees have given us voluntarily
(and have given us permission to use anonymously). The data is extracted from

Post Office’s HR system and is updated on a monthly basis.

Page 9 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

26.The Diversity dashboard shows:

a. Percentage of employees with characteristics: gender, ethnicity, sexual

orientation, religion and disability;

b. Detailed information on gender and ethnicity which shows pay bands

and departments;

c. Hiring, promotions and leavers trend analysis for 12 months (which can
be filtered by department) for gender and ethnicity and high-level

analysis for Sexual Orientation and Disability; and

d. In some instances, we are also able to split out Black, Asian, Mixed and

Other for enhanced ethnicity representation analysis.

27.This data helps the ED&l team to identify gaps, track success and assist with

forward planning of our initiatives.

28.Post Office also annually report on the Ethnicity Pay Gap and Gender Pay Gap
[RLIT0000328]. The overall mean ethnicity pay gap was 8% in 2023, down from
11% in 2022 and 12% in 2021. There has also been an increase in diverse

ethnic background representation at SLT level from 2% in 2021 to 11% in 2024.5

29.Our ED&l networks are employee led community groups that support four

under-represented groups across our business:

a. Prism - connects and supports LGBTQ+ employees;

b. Affinity - promotes the progression of women at Post Office;

c. Complexions - supports and celebrates religious and cultural diversity;

and

d. Be You - supports those with disabilities, promotes awareness of mental

health, neurodiversity and wellbeing at Post Office.

30. The ED&l networks have developed in maturity over the past five years. They

3

are very active and help to drive positive change within the business. The
networks have been able to function as a vehicle for the employee voice,
supporting the organisation to drive and deliver real change with a direct line,
for example at the ED&l Summits, into the CEO and SEG via Executive

sponsors (see paragraph 38).

.Post Office recognises the important work that these ED&l networks carry out

and provides each network with its own annual budget, allowing these groups

to continue to accelerate and build their platforms.

WITNO0760200

ED&I Training and Events

32.In 2021, Post Office ran an Unconscious Bias workshop and an Advocate and
Ally workshop which were mandatory for the SLT. The Unconscious Bias
workshop was bespoke and designed specifically for Post Office. It used
interactive learning to educate colleagues on unconscious bias and discuss
how it can affect the workplace. The Advocate and Ally Workshop was designed
to build colleagues’ understanding of leading diverse teams, and the role they

play in creating an inclusive environment.

33.Post Office also introduced its ‘Let’s Talk about Race’ series in 2021. The ‘Let's
Talk about Race’ event was a face-to face conversation programme. It was
mandatory for all employees to attend and was rolled out to over 3000
employees. It was the first time that Post Office had attempted to train every
employee in small groups via face-to-face sessions and was completed in April

2022.

34. Due to the success of ‘Let's Talk about Race’ series, Post Office launched ‘Let's
Talk About...’ sessions. These are virtual sessions where colleagues can share
their own personal stories and during which conversations and questions are
encouraged. Post Office have found that these open conversations between
colleagues have many benefits including demystifying differences, creating
comfort about language and creating an environment of openness. Feedback
for these sessions has been overwhelmingly positive. The sessions have

covered topics such as pregnancy loss, men’s health and social mobility. The

Page 12 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

sessions have proven to be extremely successful, sometimes exceeding 300

employees participating.

35.In April 2023, Post Office refreshed the e-learning catalogue and introduced a
new module for ED&l. It has been the most accessed training module with over
603 courses completed to date. The module is also regularly reviewed to

ensure that the content is relevant and up to date.

36.A new Post Office Manager Programme replaced the People Manager
Fundamentals in June 2023. The aim of this programme is to support newly
recruited, promoted or developing Post Office Managers, by providing them
with the tools to effectively manage individuals and teams in line with the Post
Office Management systems and Behaviours (please refer to Nick Read's First
Witness Statement [WITN00760100] for further information on the new
Behaviours Framework launched in July 2024). Colleagues can choose to
either complete the whole 10-month programme or select specific modules that
interest them. The ED&l module is a face-to-face full day session facilitated by

one of our trainers and ED&l manager.

37.Post Office also carries out mandatory annual training on modern slavery for
employees and provides e-learning modules for Postmasters. This ensures that
Post Office employees visiting branches know what signs to look out for and
they can raise any risks that they spot through our internal channels. The latest
revised modern slavery statement will also be published on the corporate

website at the end of September 2024.

WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

38.The ED&l Summit was created in response to Project May. The first ED&l
Summit was held in 2023 and the most recent event was in June 2024
[POL00448413]. These are quarterly meetings attended by SEG members,
senior colleagues and network members. I attended the first one in 2023, one
earlier in 2024 and will be attending future meetings including the one due to
be held in November 2024. They are an opportunity to discuss ED&l, identify
and take actions where necessary, and share best practice within the

organisation.

39.Each of these actions are indicative of Post Office’s intention to drive forward
its ED&l agenda by encouraging engagement, promoting awareness and
measuring impact of these important causes across the organisation so Post

Office can better support and understand the challenges its people are facing.

ED&I Surveys

40.Post Office now has a clearer picture of our colleague demographics via
improved data capturing and survey results which helps to shape the strategic

approach and benchmarks that Post Office can hold itself to.

41.ED&I specific surveys were introduced in 2021 to ensure Post Office colleagues
have a voice and that the business understands the topics that matter most to
colleagues’ lived experiences. Surveys have been undertaken each year since

(albeit the 2023 survey was replaced by the ED&l Audit).

Page 14 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

42.Since 2024, the ED&l questions have been integrated into the business wide
Colleague Engagement Survey [POL00446681]. This allows Post Office to
analyse ED&l insights in granular detail so the business can design and focus
its initiatives to address specific challenges that under-represented groups
might face. It also allows Post Office to monitor the impact of any initiatives and

interventions.

43.The purpose of incorporating the ED&l questions into the Colleague
Engagement Survey was to ensure that ED&l remains a responsibility and a
concern for everyone in the business, and to hold business leaders to account

for ED&l change and improvement in their business functions.

44.The 2024 Colleague Engagement Survey had an 86% response rate. The
results showed that 17% of employees who responded felt that the SLT could
do no more than they are currently doing to deliver on Post Office’s ED&I goals

[POL00446681].

45. Three in five employees of an ethnically diverse background felt that Post Office
provided equal opportunities for all. However, disabled employees were less
likely to feel that they could be their full selves at work; less likely to feel that
their views were generally heard and less likely to feel included within their

teams.

Page 15 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

46.Employees from an ethnically diverse background were less positive on
diversity metrics than those from a white background, particularly relating to

career development and diversity across organisational levels.*
47.Of those colleagues who responded to the survey:

a. 60% from an ethnically diverse background thought that Post Office
provides opportunities to thrive and succeed, compared to 69% from a

white background;

b. 57% from an ethnically diverse background felt that Post Office has
diverse representation of backgrounds and identities across all levels in

the organisation, compared to 65% from a white background; and

c. 68% from an ethnically diverse background believed that Post Office is
a diverse organisation to work in, compared to 75% from a white

background.®

48.Post Office accepts that it is necessary to review training and recruitment
processes, particularly at higher grades and related communication to ensure
all colleagues are made aware of available opportunities. The Colleague
Engagement Survey 2024 results suggest that addressing negative culture

traits experience by those in SLT positions (relating to bureaucracy, politics and

demoralising behaviours) could help to tackle some of the barriers felt by this

group.®

49.One in five Post Office employees say they have received an unwelcome
comment that felt offensive, embarrassing or hurtful, with women and LGB+
employees more likely to have experienced this. The proportion of women
experiencing this type of comment rises significantly and consistently with
seniority. Post Office are committed to addressing this via focus groups,

education and training and producing an internal communication campaign.
People Team Restructure

50.In February 2024, a restructure of the People team was announced. The
restructure represents a renewed commitment by Post Office to furthering and

developing it's ED&l agenda.

51.A new senior expert role, Head of ED&l, has been introduced to strengthen the
capabilities of the team and to support with the embedding of the new ED&l
strategy (see paragraphs 54-59). The Head of ED&lI will join Post Office on 1
October 2024. She joins us from National Express where she was Head of
Employee Experience which included Diversity, Equity & Inclusion,

Engagement & Wellbeing.

® Post Office Core Report [POL00446681].

Page 17 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

52.In June 2024, Post Office also appointed a new Talent and Capability Director,
Hawa Newell-Sydique. She brings 20 years of ED&l experience and was
pioneering in launching ED&l to the UK after completing her MBA dissertation
(a project sponsored by the then Department of Trade and Industry). She is
focused on creating, launching and embedding a renewed ED&l strategy (see
paragraphs 54-59), supported by a communications plan and robust data. She
will also integrate ED& into all parts of the people life cycle with particular focus
on the recruitment process, the Talent Management process and strengthening
the accountability of the SLT and SEG. As part of this work, the Talent and
Capability Director will conduct a review of the existing ED&I policies and

practices currently in place.

53.The recruitment of these ED&l professionals demonstrates Post Office’s

commitment to improving the lived experiences of its people.
Revised ED&I Strategy
54. Building on some of the findings of the ED&l Audit in 2023’, the new Talent and
Capability Director has started to design a new ED&I strategy to be launched

in Autumn 2024 [POL00448661].

55.The multi-year strategy is designed to deepen Post Office’s commitment to

becoming a truly inclusive and safe place for all.

7 ED&l Audit [POL00447900).

Page 18 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

56. The mission of the ED&I strategy will be:
a. Innovative — by being creative, thinking outside of the box, being curious;

b. Intentional — by understanding the data and target interventions; not

adopting a one stop- shop approach; and

c. Intersectional — by breaking siloed thinking and developing programmes

with a multi-dimensional approach.®

57.The mission is designed to complement the strategic ED&I pillars and to be

easily understood by all.

58.The three strategic ED&l pillars are Accountability, Capability and the

Embedding of programmes and interventions:
a. Accountability

i. Governance and role modelling of the strategy from the SLT is
critical. Behaviours must be exemplified by those at the top of the
business and, by prioritising ED&l within governance and
leadership structures, ED&l becomes a business outcome and an

output of the business strategy.

® EDI Strategy [POL00448661].

Page 19 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

ii. The Talent and Capability Director will hold regular meetings with
the SLT and the SEG to create ED&l action plans for their
business functions, which they will own. The purpose of doing so
is to ensure that business leaders understand and tackle ED&l
challenges within their functions. The action plans intend to hold
senior leaders to account for measurement and impact
assessment. Post Office expect this to take place from September

2024.

The Talent and Capability Director will also be attending board
meetings regularly to present updates on ED&I including ED&l

awareness, the latest data and the impact of interventions.

b. Capability

i. Specific attention will be given to the Performance Management
Process with an ED&I lens to make sure it is transparent, fair and
without bias. This aims to give Post Office a better understanding of
where its underrepresented talent is, where to give promotions,
internal movement and talent acquisition and where there is space
for opportunity. By examining this data, Post Office can make

targeted interventions.

Page 20 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

ii. Post Office will create diverse pipelines and succession plans and
understand promotion opportunities and review performance data.

There will be a particular focus on ethnically diverse colleagues.

iii. The organisation will undertake a review of ED&l Networks to align
their strategy more closely to the revised ED&l strategy once
published. The aim will be to improve collaboration and the

intersection between the ED&l Networks.

c. Embedding
i. The new ED&l strategy will be embedded across the business via
different mediums including roadshows, videos, podcasts and
classroom learning. The new strategy will also be embedded via
the ED&I objective setting required of all Post Office colleagues

(see paragraph 23).

59. As the Talent and Capability Director continues to develop their strategy, and
as part of the review of the ED&I policies in November 2024, they will review
how Post Office can support Postmasters further with ED&l. For example, by

promoting voluntary ED&l awareness training.

60.1 have also been asked about the extent to which Post Office considers

Postmasters and their managers and assistants to be relevant to its ED&l policy

and practice.

Page 21 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

61.All Post Office employees, contractors and temporary contractors must comply
with Post Office’s ED&l policies and procedures in their interactions with
Postmasters, their managers and assistants. For example, at present, the ED&l
Policy applies to those individuals, as well as third parties who work on Post

Office premises.

62.The Post Office Code of Business Conduct [POL00447907] applies to
everyone working for and with Post Office and that Postmasters, businesses,
retail partners and suppliers are expected to uphold the standards set out in

that code.

63. However, the ED&I section of the Code of Business Conduct focuses more on
Post Office building a workplace in which all employees feel a sense of
belonging and are valued for who they are and the differences they bring. It also
highlights the commitment to build an equitable, diverse and inclusive
workplace and pursue equality of opportunity and inclusion for colleagues

through recruitment and employment policies and practices.

64. Post Office is mindful that many Postmasters are independent business owners
and it does not instruct Postmasters how to operate their business or provide
Postmasters with template ED&lI policies or similar, for this reason. As a result,
some ED&l policies and practices do not explicitly apply to the conduct of
Postmasters, their managers and assistants. For example, there is no explicit

reference to them in the ED&I Policy.

Page 22 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

65.However, the Operations Manual on the Branch Hub does include information
on the standards expected of Postmasters with regards to ED&l
[POL00448361]. Within the Manual, there are dedicated sections to the
Equality Act 2010 and it clearly highlights Post Office’s requirement to uphold
and adhere to these standards. The Operations Manual also covers

accessibility, reasonable adjustments to customers and modern slavery.

66.There are also ad hoc sessions run with Postmasters, for example with the
Women’s Network. These include sessions on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome

Awareness, Baby Loss Awareness and Understanding Micro-Aggressions.

67.As Post Office revises its ED&I policies in November 2024, it will consider the
value and practicality of the policies for Postmasters. Post Office is considering

how, if at all, Phase 2 of Project May will fit into this exercise.

68. The Request has also asked why Post Office does not collate ED&I monitoring
data for Postmasters and whether its absence has an impact on Post Office’s

ability to address any related issues concerning Postmasters.

69.Post Office does not currently hold or collate ED&l monitoring data for the
Postmaster population. Nor does Post Office capture ED&l monitoring data

when onboarding new Postmasters.

70.Obtaining an accurate and representative demographic picture of the

Postmaster population is logistically difficult partly because approximately 20%

Page 23 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

of Post Office branches are operated by strategic partners, who are owned and
run by large corporate organisations. This structure means Post Office contract
directly with the corporate entity, and not the Postmaster who may be running
or operating the branch on behalf of the strategic partner. As such, Post Office
would not have the ability to capture this data although these organisations may

carry out their own ED&I data monitoring.

71.Similarly, where Postmasters operate multiple branches, the Postmaster
operator may have branch managers who manage the branches on their behalf.
Therefore, any data collected would not necessarily reflect the demographics

of the Postmaster actually running the branch.

72.Post Office does collect Postmaster demographic data via its Postmaster
Engagement Surveys, but all information is shared on a voluntary basis. The
demographic data collated during the Postmaster survey allows for data to be
analysed and insights to be drawn in relation to certain demographics. This data
is collected anonymously so there is no way of identifying and attributing data
to individuals. However, Postmaster engagement with the survey is low. The
response rate for the latest Postmaster Sentiment Survey 2024
[POL00446682] was 28% so the data Post Office receives is not statistically

representative of the entire Postmaster population.

73.Post Office sets diversity milestone goals for our employee population and our
current diversity targets for representation at all levels (subject to review in the

ED&l strategy) is as follows:

Page 24 of 28
WITNO0760200
WITNO0760200

(a) Women — 50%

(b) Diverse Ethnic Background — 18%

(c) Disability - 8%

(d) LGBTQ+ - 5%

74. We do not set any for the Postmaster population and therefore ED&l

monitoring data would not be required for that purpose.

75.A lack of ED&l monitoring data does not affect Post Office’s ability to address

ED&I issues raised by, or concerning, Postmasters.

76.Post Office investigate every complaint on an individual basis, and it does not
consider that a lack of ED&l monitoring data impacts or interferes with
investigations. Please refer to the First Witness Statement of Melanie Park
[WITN11600100] for further detail about the Postmaster complaints

procedures.

77. However, Post Office understands that collecting ED&l monitoring data for
Postmasters could be beneficial for the organisation. A lack of ED&! monitoring
data does prevent Post Office from having a holistic view of the diversity of the
Postmaster population and oversight of wider issues that may
disproportionately affect certain groups. For example, collating the ED&l

monitoring data of Postmasters would help Post Office understand the

population we serve and better identify opportunities to support or provide

specific services to support Postmasters.
