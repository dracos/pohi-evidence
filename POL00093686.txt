Subject: REGINA v SEEMA MISRA - = GUILDFORD CROWN COURT - TRIAL - ATTACK ON HORIZON

Dear All,

After a lengthy trial at Guildford Crown Court the above named was found Guilty of theft. This case tuned
from a relatively straightforward general deficiency case to an unprecedented attack on the Horizon system.
We were beset with unparallel degree of disclosure requests by the Defence. Through hard work of
everyone, Counsel Warwick Tatford, Investigation Officer Jon Longman and through the considerable
expertise of Gareth Jenkins of Fujitsu we were able to destroy to the criminal standard of proof (beyond all
feasonable doubl) every single suggestion made by the Defence. ~ .

Itis to be hoped the case will set a marker to dissuade other Defendants from jumping on the Horizon bashing
bandwagon. .
