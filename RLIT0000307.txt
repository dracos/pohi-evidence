Register for the Horizon Convictions Redress
Scheme (HCRS) (https://gov.uk/horizon-

Who can register

If you had a conviction that has been quashed by
either:

e Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act
(https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2024/14/enacted
#:~:text=An%20Act%20to%20provide%20for, Ireland%
20for%20such%20o0ffences%3B%20and)

e Post Office (Horizon System) Offences
(Scotland) Act (https:/www.parlamaid-alba.scot/bills-
and-laws/bills/post-office-horizon-system-offences-

scotland-bill

you are eligible for financial redress. This means we
will pay you for your losses.

You can still register if you think you’re eligible for
the scheme but you’ve not got a letter.

If your conviction has been quashed

Your court and police records are being amended
by His Majesty's Courts & Tribunals Service
(HMCTS) and the Police.

The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) is
ensuring that records of your quashed convictions
are removed from the Police National Computer
(PNC). Since the PNC is the single national
collection of convictions, this means that:

e there will no longer be a record of your quashed
conviction available for day-to-day policing

05/08/2024, 10:36 Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS): applying for financial redress - GOV.UK
e the quashed conviction will not be disclosed on
any future criminal record check, such as a
Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check

2. Complete your ID checks

Use our guidance on how to complete your ID
checks for HCRS (https://www.gov.uk/horizon-
convictions-redress-scheme/proving-your-identity).

3. Apply for your preliminary
payment

Once your identification documents have been
verified, you and your solicitor will need to complete
and send us the preliminary payment application
form. This form also includes a fraud safeguard
statement you'll need to sign.

You will then receive a preliminary payment of
£200,000.

This allows you time to consider whether to accept
the £600,000 optional fixed settlement or request a
detailed assessment.

If you live in the UK, you do not need to pay tax on
any payments you get from the HCRS. They will not
impact any benefits you receive.

Complete the HCRS preliminary payment
application form
(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66a88
fdcce1fd0da7b592f1 3/hcrs-preliminary-payment-
application-form.odt) (ODT, 38.9 KB) and email it
to
horizonconvictionsredress.
to receive your £200,000 preliminary payment.

We'll email you when we've processed your
payment.

4. Read the assessment framework
and your disclosure bundle

You and your solicitor should use the available
documents to decide whether you’re going to take
the optional fixed settlement of £600,000 or request
a detailed assessment.

If you decide to accept the £600,000 optional fixed
settlement, you will receive a final payment of
£400,000. This amount when added to your
£200,000 preliminary payment, will equal the
£600,000 optional fixed settlement.

Assessment framework

The assessment framework sets out some
examples of losses, and how much you might be
owed in financial redress under the scheme for
suffering them.

Read the assessment framework
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/horizon-
convictions-redress-scheme-hcrs-assessment-

framework).

Disclosure bundle

If you were a postmaster, employed directly by the
Post Office, you will receive a disclosure bundle.

Your disclosure bundle is a set of documents
related to your work with the Post Office, and the
events leading up to your conviction.

At this stage, your disclosure bundle will include the
information we have on:

e your contract and remuneration with the Post
Office

e whether you were eligible for the Royal Mail
Share Plan

Your bundle will be uploaded to a secure portal,
along with any other documents we share with

There is no time limit for you to decide which option

to take.

Option 1: take the £600,000 optional
fixed settlement

If you decide to accept the £600,000 optional fixed
settlement, you will receive a final payment of
£400,000. This amount when added to your
£200,000 preliminary payment, will equal the
£600,000 optional fixed settlement.

If you accept the fixed sum settlement, you cannot
get a detailed assessment at a later stage.

If you live in the UK, you do not need to pay tax on
any payments you get from the HCRS. They will not
impact any benefits you receive.

Complete the HCRS fixed settlement
application form
(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66a78
503fc8e12ac3edb0608/hcrs-fixed-settlement-
application-form.odt) (ODT, 33.1 KB) and email it
to
horizonconvictionsredress
to take the £600,000 optional fixed settlement.

Option 2: request a detailed
assessment

If you request a detailed assessment:

* your detailed assessment settlement might be
less than £600,000

e you won’t be able to take the optional fixed
settlement of £600,000 at a later stage

You will need to provide evidence of your losses so
you can receive the exact amount you lost.

This includes both financial damages (such as lost

earnings) and personal damages (the impact on
your life).
