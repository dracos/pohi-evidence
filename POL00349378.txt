Jarnail,

At your request we have again considered the decision of Sir Anthony Hooper to pees his casting

vote in M030. We are of the opinion that, were POL to mediate on the basis of the issue “

whether the PO would agree to support an application for permission to appeal that gonviceont a
number of significant and potentially unresolvable difficulties arise:

1.

There are 38 so-called criminal Applicants in the scheme. If one such Applicant were to be
permitted to mediate this issue then others will seek a similar concession, no doubt spurred on
by SS. Such a position would be both intolerable and untenable: for POL to mediate potential
appeal assistance with all, or most of, the criminal Applicants (not an impossible scenario)
POL00349378
POL00349378

would necessitate both considerable expenditure and, if the mediation process were to be
conducted according to the spirit of the scheme, potentially involve the making of concessions
regarding the investigative and prosecutorial process and Horizon operability.

2. Were the outcome of a mediation conducted on this issue to result in POL lending support to
an appeal, I foresee the following consequences:

i. POL would be required to answer to the Court of Appeal both for its earlier
prosecutorial decisions and its new (mediated) stance. POL’s support of an appeal for
only one of 7 offences (as in this case) would take some explaining. Given that any
appeal against a theft conviction must be predicated upon (alleged/ perceived) Horizon
failings, the Court would inevitably wish to consider allegations of Horizon error,
reliability, etc. Such an enquiry could involve investigation into the wider Horizon
context.

ii. The implications for POL, were such an appeal to be successful, would include both a
further disclosure exercise of some considerable scope and further appeals, for a finding
by the Court against Horizon would fundamentally (and adversely) alter POL’s
position on the topic.

iii. I We have reviewed some 300 criminal convictions (and guilty pleas) back to 1st January
2010. It is likely that a substantial number of these convictions would be appealed off
the back of a successful first appeal.

iv. The Court of Appeal sits in open hearing and the press are permitted to attend and
report upon proceedings. Given media interest thus far it is inevitable that a (largely
hostile) press would attend and report widely on the proceedings.

3. POL could, I suppose, refuse to mediate with this Applicant. Such a course however would
likely engender stiff opposition from SS, who would no doubt publicise the fact. The
repercussions of that publicity would be felt both within the scheme itself and by a wider
audience.

We again reiterate our advice that POL should not engage in any mediation process with so-called
criminal Applicants.
