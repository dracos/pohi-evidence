Potential exposures from removal of DSS requirements/new contract

Security

DSS security standards (DITSS) are
considerably better defined than the
referenced PO/POCL standards.

Any removal of the DSS standards
may render us exposed.

Retain reference to DSS security standards

Substitute fuller standards (not yet
available)

Data Protection

DSS had detailed requirements for
compliance with Data Protection Act
and provision of information for
subject access requests.

(Min)

Check if POCL are exposed - DSS
requirement was specific due to large
customer database etc

Availability of Fraud Information

POCL were intended to obtain
information from Pathway’s FRMS.
from DSS, as POCL had not contracted
for this information from Pathway.

Although much of this information is
not longer relevant with the removal of
BPS, some elements (eg out of hours
transactions) may still be desirable to
obtain.

POCL raise Change Request on Pathway
for provision of required information

Source information from TIP (assuming all
data that is required is already passed
from Pathway

Commercial Audit/Charging

The revision of the charging structure
will require changes to the invoicing
arrangements. POCL will need to be
able to audit these revised processes.

Introduce Requirement into new contract

Check that no audit/controls rights lost

OBCS use of PCHL

Certain OBCS operations were
believed to be going to use the PCHL
helpdesk.

Check nothing lost
