Hi Jonny,

To add to Pete’s response, we wouldn’t have been aware of EPOSS transactions either. All transactions were
effectively controlled by Reference data which was managed by POL. All the offline Banking and Giro Bank
transactions I mentioned were EPOSS Transactions. As far as Horizon was concerned, a button was visible at the
counter which allowed the transaction to be recorded and enabled a value (and often an associated fee) to be
captured and then Horizon would settle the stack. What the transaction meant in the “real world” or what other
associated paper work was produced was totally outside of our knowledge. At the end of the customer session the
stack could then be settled — initially using cash or cheques, but after late 2003, Debit Cards were also supported. One
key difference between a Post Office and most retail stores is that some transactions resulted in money being paid to
the customer rather than the customer paying. It was this additional complexity that meant a standard retail solution
wasn’t appropriate.

In particular, the set of transactions in each branch would vary (again controlled by Ref Data.
Best wishes

Gareth

There are a number of transactions that are controlled by the Mails or on line banking software that Fujitsu would
have knowledge of but since the introduction of AP and APADC Fujitsu would not necessarily know for what
organisations or details of the business outcomes of a many of the transactions on Horizon. Post Office may have a
current and past list of these transactions on the system.

Thank you for this.

Is there a list of transactions that could be conducted in Post Office branches? Or a list of transactions that Post
Office asked FJ to make possible on Horizon?

Hi Jonny,
Please see responses below prefixed [GJ].

NB these are all really process questions which need to be considered by POL. I have no real knowledge of the paper
trails that exist and how they are reconciled, though I have been involved in projects to try and remove some of the
paper trails more recently.. I know POL were trying to remove as much of that as possible and this was certainly
possible with online banking, but back in 2000 to 2004 (which is what we are looking at) there was a lot more paper
about.

Best wishes

Hi Gareth,
Further to my email below, please would you be able to answer the following questions ASAP today?

1. Could FJ have inserted transactions which had the effect of making deposits into PO savings accounts, ISAs
etc.?
[G1] I don’t think these existed back in 2000 to 2004. It realy comes down to the paper trail.
2. If so, would they have been detectable (like a Giro Bank transaction would be detectable due to the
reconciliation between Horizon records and the paper trail)
[GI] need to check with POL
3. If not, why was it not possible for FJ have inserted transactions which had the effect of making deposits into
FUJ00161750
FUJ00161750

PO savings accounts, ISAs etc.?
[GIJ] Main reason is such products didn’t exist then, and I would have expected there to be some sort of paper trail.
NB POL would also be concerned about Postmasters injecting such transactions.
4. What is the significance of the introduction of online banking in 2003? Could FJ have injected a transaction
into a third party bank account after the introduction of online banking? If not, why not?
[GU] No they couldn’t. With online banking any Banking transaction (including deposits) was initially sent
electronically to the bank before it was completed at the counter. The daily banking reconciliation then compared
the details that the banks had of all transactions with the horizon feed. The electronic feed to the bank was digitally
signed and so couldn’t be generated by support staff, only the horizon record of the completed transaction could be
injected, and reconciliation would soon pick that up, and more importantly, it was the signed electronic version that
the banks accepted as a deposit!

Hi Jonny,

Sorry, but you didn’t send me the actual question until I’d gone off line around 4ish yesterday, so other than the
phone call I had from Pete, I didn’t see the emails until late last night.

A further clarification:

1. The Giro Bank Transactions are not AP, but standard EPOSS Transactions. I don’t know how info on them got
to Giro Bank — it may well be that Giro Bank worked off the paper trail and then sent summaries to POL which
they then reconciled with the Horizon feed. POL would need to provide the details.

2. Prior to online banking (introduced in 2003), POL did support some (but not all) other banks with deposit and
cheque cashing facilities. Again these were EPOSS (not AP) transactions. I assume that there was also a paper
trail here and it would work in a similar way to Giro Bank. Again it is POL that need to define the process. All
Horizon did was provide the buttons to record the electronic part of the transaction.

Is there any point in me re-reading Steve’s statement? I’m out this morning, but could do so this afternoon.

Hope this helps.
Best wishes

le examples to use - effective software fixes [WBDUK-

Yes it has been sent to Gareth, but it is:

How is it possible for SSC to inject a GIRO bank transfer into a set of branch accounts but it isn't possible to
inject another bank deposit? Gareth’s answer Giro Bank paying in was possible into accounts by AP as it was
introduced before on line banking so you needed was the account number and detailed knowledge of the
system so theoretically it was possible. But there was a paper work trail to back this up that the sub-postmaster
had to send in to POL which should then reconcile to the AP transaction file from Horizon. (Post Office would
understand how it worked). A report was produced daily to reconcile against the Horizon feed, any discrepancy
Post Office may find where the paper work was not present would be discussed with the branch at the time.
Post Office can describe what would happen if the paperwork was not available.

Steve thinks the answer is:

I think the answer is that Giro bank is also an AP transaction (like bill payments). It is the only type of bank
account that is. All other banking deposits go through a totally different path. There may have been other
banks who had similar facilities before on line banking was introduced in 2004? but you would have to ask
Post Office as they were AP transactions.

Steve,

Thank you for this. Updated version attached. We are down to one point to bottom out, which is the GIRO bank
theory in para. 35. The bit we are struggling with is that it if it is possible to deposit money in a Giro bank account, how
is it not possible to deposit money in a normal account. Why is a paper slip necessary for this type of account?

It might be worth having a quick call on this. Are you free?

Jonny, we’ve been looking at some potential examples to use within the witness statement. Suggest WBD have a look
and decide if it is useful to add them as examples?

Effective Software Fixes

Pcoos9918: PSteed2847N - reverse a rem, but when this has been reversed it is doubling up on a

balance
+ve: Already mentioned in statement but still shows a quick software error turn round

28/04/03: SSC (Paul Steed) identified error

28/04/03: Paul Steed updated and sent to MSU to handle discrepancy with FAD & POL

30/04/03: Development identify error

01/05/03: Work Package generated: PWY_WP_16353 B3S30R

07/05/03: Tested on LST. Fix released.

09/05/03: I have spoken to the PM to say that the software fix was sent down and became active on 07-May-2003
and so there should be no recurrences of the original problem.

PC0123699: 28/07/05 ...payments and receipts are mismatched...PM states he was balancing on node

2 but there was discrepancies..

-ve: Initial SSC response was erroneous, to send back to Helpdesk.

+ve: Fast fix to live for financial issue

+ve: Demonstrates passing to MSU to tie up financial impact with POL

+ve: Example of looking at more than one site, diligence identifying other sites with issue
FUJ00161750
FUJ00161750

it in to other sites

28/07/05: Incorrectly sent back by SSC ...Balancing problems should be dealt with initially by NBSC...

28/07/05: ... Have spoken with the PM and advised...All that remains now is for us to try and identify the root cause of
the discrepancy which may take a while. As per usual we will forward our findings on to the MSU who will advise POL
accordingly...

29/07/05 With development. Work Package PWY_WP_22602 generated

01/08/05: BI3S80R_WP22602 is now ready for test

02/08/05: Release PinICL PC0123865

08/08/05: This has passed testing in LST and is being returned to RM for live pilot.

09/08/05: sent out to the Pilot 100 successfully

05/09/05: Applied to all live outlets and now in the live Generic Prodlists roll-outs using both S70 and $80 spares

When the PM went to produce a trail balance a discrepancy was shown but at the bottom the receipts and payment
totals did not match.

The £170 discrepancy was down to an APS txn message that had no product number and no primary or secondary
mappings. There was a critical event raised on 21st Jul on counter 9 which helped to identify this (Event Id:4 with the
text "Error Message: Failed to generate EPOSSCore transaction grammar").

As the txn message was incomplete it was omitted from the rollover 'calculations' and thus caused the discrepancy
reported.

When I checked the tivoli event archives yesterday I found that 216 of these events had been logged in the past 7 days
at different offices/counters

Looks like whenever the event is raised it is either down to a cancelled quantum txn

Have checked out a sample of 40 to 50 sites and they're all at S80 so its probably safe to assume its an S80 problem.
