e Introduction

This document describes the unit testing done on “Operation Launch” following the
instructions given in the UTP.

e Pre-Requisites
The prerequisites are all listed in section 2.0 “Pre-Requisites” of the UTP.

e Test Harness, Tools and Data

The test harness, tools and data are all described in section 3.0 “Test Harness, Tools
and Data” of the UTP.

e Test Entry Criteria

© Code inspection and consequent code updates complete Vv

¢ Unit Test Plan reviewed and approved Vv

e All necessary test harnesses, test tools and test data available Ni

e Test environment ready Vv
¢ Details

e Preparation

The preparation is all described in section 5.1 “Preparation” of the UTP.

With regards to step I listed there the build was actually a BI2 build (WR2.1.0) of
which the last work package installed was 13334.

With regards to the other steps all Operation Launch components used which are in
VSS are labelled “NB/LLD/001 V 0.2 Test Complete” — this includes two binaries the
source of which were not yet in VSS — NBSwitcher.exe and NBComLib.dll. The other
components used are listed in the table below

All the tests listed in section 5.2 “Functionality Test” of the UTP were run.

e All tests completed as expected

e Event log entries checked

e Minor bug fixes made!

e Non-Functional Tests

e Performance

Pool paged bytes for both Desktop and Riposte were monitored with Performance
Monitor for 7212 cycles of the soak test (see section 5.3.1 “Performance” in the UTP
for details of this) which meant over 14000 operations were launched. No memory
leakage was detected in the Desktop at all — for Riposte the figures are given in the

table below
Pool Paged Bytes

When Min Max
Start 22432.000 22464.000
Finish 22560.000 22592.000

This is much more likely to be a problem with Riposte than with Operation Launch

since Operation Launch shares its memory with the Desktop.

Time-Related Issues

‘In this cases there were no minor bugs to fix.

e Test Coverage
As UTP

e Test exit

e All tests specified in the UTP have been run, or a justification V
provided in this document for those, if any, which have not been run

e No major incidents (A or B priority) outstanding v

e Incidents raised Unit Testing have been recorded (in a local Vv

spreadsheet) and summarised in the UTR /if necessary).
e All minor incidents (C priority or lower) outstanding at the end of the I J
Unit Test have been formally raised as PinICLs
e UTP updated and re-issued /if necessary) Vv

e Summary Of Problems Found

The only possible problem found was that Riposte may have a memory leak. It is
considered beyond the scope of this module test to progress this further.
