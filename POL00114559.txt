Joint Investigation Protocols RMGS and PO Ltd Security
1. Introduction

14. These Procedures and Standards (P&S) detail the protocol underpinning the relationship between Royal
Mail Group Security (RMGS) Criminal Investigation Team (CIT) and Post Office Limited (PO Ltd) Security
Team in regard to criminal Investigations that affect both businesses.

1.2 Since the separation of PO Ltd and Royal Mail Group (RMG) it has become increasingly necessary to
formalise the relationship between the two respective investigation teams. A Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) exists between our two teams and from time to time investigation staff from either
side will need to liaise with their counterparts and exchange intelligence, seek information or jointly work
together on crimes of mutual interest. Embedded below is a copy of that MOU which Investigators must
familiarise themselves with.

1.3 Bi-monthly meetings will take place between Derek C Pratt RMGS and Dave Posnett PO Ltd to ensure each
party is aware of live investigations on hand, review current casework and resolve any matters of concern.

2. Liaison Protocol

2.1 Both RMGS and PO Ltd Security will initiate enquiries in line with their respective trigger points. Where the
reported incident impacts across the other business then, within seven days, the affected business will be
advised of details of enquiries made. This is irrespective of the triggers applied by the parent business.

2.2 When a RMGS enquiry suggests the offence has taken place on PO Ltd premises (Crown or Sub offices)
and/or involves PO Ltd staff the initial point of contact for RMGS Investigators is the PO Ltd Security
Casework Team on ‘or post.office.securityé
contact RMGS their initial point of contact is RMGS Helpdesk on (

2.3 To ensure intelligence sharing takes place and that neither party takes unilateral action that might impact.
negatively on existing or planned lines of enquiry, initial discussions about the suspicions will take place
between investigators from both parties. Following this discussion the lead Investigator will be agreed.

2.4 The lead Investigator (RMGS or PO Ltd) must then complete a Terms of Reference (TOR) form GS046. The
completed GS046 should outline the proposed actions and accountabilities of each party and be updated if
changes occur as the case progresses.

2.5 Acopy of the completed GSO46 must be emailed to the identified counterpart in the other business on
completion and whenever the form is updated. In RMGS a copy of new or amended GS046 should be
forwarded to the Investigator’s line manager, the relevant Head of Investigation (HOI) and Derek C Pratt.

2.6 The investigation will then proceed accordingly with support from both parties as necessary.

2.7 In some cases the GS046 form will serve only as a way of ensuring PO Ltd Security are aware of our
activities and require no further involvement on their part.

2.8 Should an offender be apprehended, a copy of the Exec Summary should be served on both the POL/RMG
counterpart and Derek Pratt.

2.9 While it is appreciated that this will add a layer of bureaucracy to current ad hoc arrangements, the nature
of our relationship with PO Ltd Security has necessarily had to become more prescribed as a consequence

of the separation of the organisations and privatisation of Royal Mail Group. What remains however is a
shared enthusiasm to remove offenders, resolve crimes and to work together for the mutual benefit of each
organisation and we will continue to share intelligence and work closely with our colleagues in PO Ltd.

Obtaining Horizon & Credence Data

Should it become necessary to acquire Horizon data (the computerised accounting software used in all PO
Ltd outlets to record transactions on the counter), the request should be submitted by e-mail to Paul
Ackroyd the Acquisition and Disclosure Manager and SPOC, RMGS with specific details of what is required.
Please be aware that such data is only available via Fujitsu who make a charge for data retrieval. Less
comprehensive data (‘Credence’) is more readily available from PO Ltd Security at no cost which may be
sufficient for your needs and this too can be accessed via Paul Ackroyd. (In most cases a phone~call before
submitting the request will enable him to determine the best source of information.)

In the event of a joint enquiry where PO Ltd Security has the lead, it would be expected that such requests
and the subsequent charges would be met by PO Ltd. Alternatively it may be necessary to include this
expenditure in the investigation costs on any subsequent prosecution case.

Escalation Process
If despite best efforts there are issues which cannot be resolved then the matter should be escalated

through the line to HO! level. Thereafter, these should be referred to Derek C Pratt to seek resolution with
his counterpart in PO Ltd Security.
