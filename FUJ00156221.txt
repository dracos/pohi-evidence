Gareth

I hope you had an enjoyable and restful break.
Please see mail string.

Would you please be able to provide a tighter estimate for BTS provision for early October? I said it was approx 5
day’s work, but we need to then confirm residual time available on the CP, which I believe was for the provision of 10
days of your time. We may well have some busy days ahead!

Many thanks
Penny

Yes please. I need a price asap though, because I'll need to ensure we have provision if the current requisition is
inadequate, thanks

Hi Mark

Unfortunately we did not start work on the tools to capture the BTS and Gareth is now on leave for 2 weeks, returning
week commencing 27 September. I spent a fair amount of time on Friday trying to locate a previous copy we had
provided, unfortunately without luck.

I attach a copy of Gareth’s statement supporting duplicated transactions.

Kind regards
Penny

Penny, I have a real live request for a copy of a BTS, however this is beyond the 6 months for migrated branches, so I
guess we are unable to retrieve a copy direct from the branch.

Did you manage to progress any further with the process you were looking at to produce BTS at your end, thank you.

Also, I'm looking for a copy of the expert witness statement that Gareth completed for our solicitors in respect of the
duplicated data. I have to ring Juliet today, as one of the investigators (re: Rinkfield) requires to use the statement,
however I understand Juliet wanted a couple of amendments, but I can’t locate the draft.

I am the appeals manager dealing with the case for FERNDOWN 282508 2 the BTS for Period 11 is missing I am
trying to establish how and how is responsible for this, the issue is that the subpostmaster is suggesting that false
figures have appeared in the office account and this has caused them losses, as you can see I have Period 10 of last
year and Period 12 but not period 11 if this could be provided it would be very helpful in my appeal deliberations,
however if this is going to cost a fortune to achieve them I am happy to not proceed with the request, any help or
advice on this gratefully received.

With regard to your enquiry about the missing Branch Trading Account, please contact Mark Dinsdale as he is our PO
contact with Fujitsu. He may be able to get Fujitsu to provide one although as you can see from the attached e-mails
this is an ongoing issue.

Enjoy your holiday and see you on the 11th October.

Yes I believe Penny is referring to the Branch Trading Statements (BTS for short) stating they can be reprinted which
is news to me as I was always under the impression they could not.

However it does appear that this is only for either 12 or now 6 months when often the requests are historical for
perhaps 2-3 years.

If this can be clarified by Penny it would be very useful for everyone to be aware of this being available.

Gary, hope you can further assist on this one. This is an extract from Penny. Is this the same thing as the Branch
Trading Statement, or is she referring to something else. She appears to be on the same page which means that it is
possible to obtain a reprint, but from Fujitsu.

Cheers

Mark

On Horizon it was possible to reprint the Balance Reports and BTS for up to 12 months.
On HNG-X we believe it is possible to do this for 6 months. Also, it is only BTS

reports that were migrated from Horizon to HNG-X.

We believe we could provide some assistance here, but it would not be part of the
standard service.

Before our application migrated to HNG-X we developed and used a specific tool to print
out Balance report and BTSs from audit records.

We should be able to develop something similar around the HNG-X retrieval tools that we
now have for Horizon data.

For HNG-X this data is also in the audit trail and we should be able to extract it.
Are you looking for Balance reports for a Horizon office?

At this stage we are not sure about costs, but we should be able to develop a tool with
approximately 5 man days of effort - which we could book to the Litigation Support CT
for Gareth Jenkins.

Kind regards
Penny

It appears that this person (Philip de Nahlik) is talking about the Branch Trading Statements and I don’t think these
are able to be re created by Fujitsu as he states. The information on the Horizon data will show the actual trading
period discrepancy but that’s about all.

Perhaps a phone call to him may establish the office he is dealing with and in turn allow us to identify the Fraud
Advisor who is actually dealing with the case. It may be then that better copies could be supplied or arrangements can
be made for the originals to be viewed.

Dear Sirs

HORIZON/POST OFFICE SYSTEMS

Tam London partner of Begbies Traynor accountants in charge of forensic accountancy.

Ihave over the years carried out a number of Post Office investigations.

T have a situation where in a current case the monthly management statement print outs are too faint to read
(even the originals). My memory of an earlier job is that you at Fujitsu can re create these monthly

management statements and reprint them,

Please could you confirm this and at the same time please also supply a name and contact telephone number so
Ican follow up.

Many thanks, this is I regret as ever an urgent issue.

Yours sincerely
