EQUIPMENT:
* As you are now on the POL system we can finally crack on with equipment set up:
o IT will arrange laptop next week. Question: Do you want us to courier over once
finished or would you rather just collect on Mon 25°"?
o I'll order your iphone asap

MEETING REQUESTS:
¢ Owen Woodley, Deputy CEO has asked if you’d be happy to have an intro call with him next week
ahead of you starting?
e Juliet Lang and Tracey Lloyd are keen to get some time with you re Pulse survey and engagement
update (see attached email and below fyi) — am holding time on Tues 3 Oct
We will share where we are on our Engagement lifecycle journey to date, including the
organisational results from last year, the progress made against the action plan and also
the results of the recent People Pulse survey. The Pulse survey is the temperature check to
listen to our colleagues in the People team (we are doing this with every Function) to
understand how we are progressing against our ‘You Said, we did’ Engagement action
plan, measure what improvements have been made, and find out what more support our
people need. We will be getting an amalgamated report, business wide, once all the
Functions have participated in the survey and received their individual reports in
November. For some context, attached is the ‘You said, we did’ action plan we shared at
the colleague conference in April.

PLT:
Am slightly concerned with the well being of PLT and wondered if you'd be happy to have a quick call
next week so I can give you an update?

REGULAR MEETINGS - 1* week:

* Monday’s CEO Lead Team calls — fyi CP, Chief of Staff, has emailed the GE today regarding
outlining the purpose of these meetings and I wanted to share with you (see attached). FY! The
PLT prepare bullets for you by Friday afternoon to give an overview of what's happening in all
areas of People function (I have attached this week's fyi)

* Monday PLT catch up meetings — these used to be for cascading info from CEO Lead Team
meetings, with an outline of what they were allowed to cascade down to their teams. However
the format changed at the beginning of this year, and has now become a very general update
from each PLT member on what they are working on. They are getting frustrated as feel it’s
becoming a run through of everyone’s ‘to do list, and that there is a lack of information being
shared with them

© People team calls — these are monthly with the next one on 4" Oct. Kayleigh Young, Head of
Culture Change & Engagement, prepares agenda/script/slides for you. As discussed we’re
holding an intro call on Tues 26" Sept — do you want to have a quick call with Kayleigh ahead of
that (she’s on holiday though until Mon 25")? Are you happy to do just a simple call or do you
POL00458469
POL00458469

need any slides etc? Also she’s asked:
oO Can we get some intro bullets on Karen for the People Team site: Meet the Chief
People Officer and People Team (sharepoint.com) — Just like a bio e.g. experience, any
plans for her role etc. what she’s excited about? (This is business wide view so keep
generic)
© Maybe an in person coffee session if people want to attend and ask any Qs?

* Wednesday’s 10@10 — Nick would like to introduce you to the weekly all staff call/meeting
(10 mins approx.) — if you would like to say a few words? There is a longer November Townhall
on Wed 15" Nov

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Best wishes
