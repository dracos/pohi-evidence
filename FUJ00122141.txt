Neneh / Penny,
I've added in some comments.

Not really sure how to progress this any further. I suggest we wait until we have a case that actually
requires analysis of Network Banking etc and worry about it then rather than trying to put together
something generic now.

Regards
Gareth

Hi, Gareth,

As per our discussion.

PSA copy of our current WS. Penny Thomas has marked up some areas that need attention for us to be able
to provide further WS to the PO. It has only come to our notice that quite a few things have changed eg
OBCS, TMS since June O05 and we would like the ws to reflect these.

Please could you look at this when you've got some time and let me know when it's convenient for you to
discuss.

Neneh,
I've updated the witness Statement as discussed.

I'm left some of the Networking bit highlighted in Blue, since I can't say that I know it is true (but it
probably is). It may be OK just to delete that bit. what is left in that section may be sufficient (I
guess it depends upon what the issue is!) I've removed the blue highlighting from the rest of the
document.

I've used "Revisions" so that you can see what I’ve changed. I've highlighted the Date etc in yellow to
remind us to update it for the final version.

Happy to discuss further.

Regards

Gareth
