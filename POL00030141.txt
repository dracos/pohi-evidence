WITNESS STATEMENT OF STEPHEN PAUL PARKER

I, STEPHEN PAUL PARKER of Lovelace Road, Bracknell, Berkshire RG12 8SN WILL
SAY as follows:

1. I am employed by Fujitsu Services Limited (Fujitsu) as Head of Post Office
Application Support.

2. I am authorised to make this statement on behalf of Post Office Limited (Post
Office), the Defendant in these proceedings, in relation to the Horizon Issues trial
listed for March 2019.

3. The facts set out in this statement are within my own knowledge, or if they are
outside my knowledge, I have explained the source of my information or belief.

4. In this statement I refer to copy documents attached and marked Exhibit SPP1.
BACKGROUND
5. I started working on the Royal Mail Group Account, later called the Post Office

Account, in July 1997, before the introduction of Horizon. I have continued to
provide support to the Post Office Account in my various roles at Fujitsu
throughout the whole of Horizon's life.

6. Prior to my work on the Post Office account, I held a numberof roles within the IT
industry, including an in-house operations and support role for critical online
systems, support consultancy services and design and development role in an

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

End User Technology group in relation to Microsoft tools for internal and external
customers.

7. I began working in July 1997 as a support consultant and deputy manager within
the Software Support Centre (SSC) for the Royal Mail Group Account, providing
third line application support for the Horizon application. Within this role I was the
lead designer and part of development team for the internal website providing
support knowledge (KEL) database, technical documentation management ad
operational change control. I also assisted the SSC manager in the provision of
the support service and operational management Although I did not have the
formal title, I acted as the deputy manager to the SSC as a whole.

7A Between December 2009 and March 2010 I was a full time Problem Manager /
Operational Manager of the SSC, responsible for the management of incidents
through the whole support process.

7.2 In March 2010 I became the Manager of the SSC and was responsible for the
provision of third line application support to the Post Office Account, including the
management of the staff working on the account. The SSC subsequently
expanded into a shared service, providing support services to a number of Fujitsu
customers, the largest of which is still the Post Office Horizon system. As head
of this unit I am currently responsible for strategic support, managing 25 — 40
staff.

RICHARD ROLL'S STATEMENT

8. I have been asked to comment on the witness statement of Mr Roll dated 11 July
2016 put forward by the Claimants in relation to the Horizon Issues trial in March
2019. I worked with Mr Roll while he was employed by Fujitsu in the SSC (I
understand from Fujitsu's HR department that this was from 5 March 2001 until 17
September 2004). As explained above, although I did not have the formal title, I
acted as deputy manager while Mr Roll was there.

9. The Horizon system was rolled out across the Post Office network between 1999
and 2000. In 2010 there was a migration from the system commonly referred to
as “Legacy Horizon" to an online version ("HNG-X" or “Horizon Online").
Therefore, when Mr Roll refers to the Horizon system he is referring to Legacy
Horizon and where I respond to an assertion made by Mr Roll I am also referring
to Legacy Horizon unless otherwise stated. Much of my statement also applies to
Horizon Online, however.

10. I found Mr Roll to be a conscientious worker and provided him with a personal
reference for a position that he applied for after leaving Fujitsu (it was a personal

AC_152871086_1 2
POL00030141
POL00030141

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

reference because Fujitsu does not allow staff to provide references on behalf of
the company).

11. In his statement Mr Roll suggests that there were frequent instances of software
problems in Horizon that had an impact on branch transaction data and which
Fujitsu resolved "remotely" (i.e. not in a branch), not merely by changing the
software but also by frequently changing branch transaction data (by injecting
new transaction data and by editing or deleting existing transaction data), without
informing branches that such actions were being taken. As I explain below, those
suggestions are incorrect and Mr Roll's account of Fujitsu's actions and powers is
inaccurate and misleading.

12. In order to explain why, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of what
Fujitsu was able to do, what the effects of its actions were and the extent to which
such actions had any effect on transaction data in branches. This is described
further below, but I would like to make some general responses immediately.

13. It is correct that the SSC had (and has) the ability to view data in branches and
other sources such as data centres remotely (in read-only mode): that is to be
expected given their support role which is described in paragraph 26 below.

14. Post Office did (and does) not have the same ability— what it could (and can) do
is view copies of transaction data as replicated from Horizon to a variety of Post
Office systems. In Horizon Online, facilities have been added which allow Post
Office to remotely examine branch data held in the Branch Database @RDB) in
read-only mode for a variety of business reasons, such as monitoring levels of
cash that are in branches based on the data entered onto Horizon by branch staff.

15. It is also correct that issues sometimes arose which necessitated changes to the
Horizon software. However, this was not something that Mr Roll played any
significant part in, as I describe in paragraphs 34 and 35 below.

16. It was (and is) theoretically possible for there to be a software problem which
could cause a financial impact in branch accounts, but this was (and is) extremely
rare and Horizon's countermeasures were (and are) very likely to pick such
matters up. In my experience, these problems have always represented a very
small proportion of the issues which led to software changes and a very small
proportion of the overall issues dealt with by the SSC.

17. On the very rare occasion that a software problem which could cause a financial
impact in branch accounts arose, it would be investigated and resolved and
Fujitsu would determine its impact on the Horizon estate and inform Post Office of
any financial impact on branches so that they could be resolved.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

In Legacy Horizon it was possible for the data in a particular counter in a branch
to become inconsistent with replicated copies, and Mr Roll appears to be
describing this in paragraph 17 of his statement. In that situation there could be
remote management by Fujitsu to correct the problem, but branch transaction
data was not changed in any way. As explained in paragraph 55 below, the work-
round involved replicating the correct data from another counter in the affected
branch or from the data centre copy.

The suggestion that Fujitsu edited or deleted transaction data is not correct. In
Legacy Horizon it was not possible to delete or edit messages that had been
committed to the message store. See the explanation of my colleague Torstein
Godeseth in paragraph 37 of his witness statement dated 27 September 2018

which reflects my understanding and experience of Horizon’s functionality.

In para 18 of his statement, Mr Roll also suggests that in Legacy Horizon he and
others in the SSC could "insert transactions and transfer money without the sub-
postmaster knowing". However:

No Fujitsu personnel have ever had the ability to "transfer money’ out of Horizon
into, for example, an individual's account

Some members of the SSC were (and some remain) able to insert transaction
data. SSC access privilege gave the ability to inject transactions, but appropriate
change controls were in place and no such insertion would have happened

without complying with those controls.

I should make it clear that, in this witness statement, I am concentrating on what
the support process is designed and able to do and not any malicious misuse of
these facilities. Malicious misuse makes most things possible, as with any other
IT system, however, Horizon had a number of checks and security settings in
place that made it very difficult to carry out malicious misuse. In any event such
misuse would have been discovered by consistency checks or colleagues (all
access was controlled and audited) and would have resulted in instant dismissal.
But even a malicious user would not have been able to “transfer money”.

As there is no way in which money could be taken from a branch and moved
anywhere else (for example into the employee's bank account), it follows that
there was no motive for anyone to do this. It is not clear to me why anyone at
Fujitsu would insert transaction data into a branch's accounts without there being

a legitimate reason for doing so. Furthermore:

Any transaction that was inserted would immediately cause a discrepancy to
arise in the branch's accounts. For example, if a transaction were to be inserted

which stated that £1,000 of stamps had been boughtby a customer who paid
cash, that would immediately cause a reduction in stock levels of stamps in that
branch and the branch would have £1,000 less in cash than Horizon expected it
to have.

In other words, although a transaction could be inserted, it would immediately
become apparent that this had been done and ultimately it would not benefitany

member of staff to behave in this way.

It is correct that the "remote access" described above could have been carried out
without the permission of a Subpostmaster. However, any additional transactions
inserted remotely would be identifiable as such from the transaction logs that are

available to Subpostmasters from Horizon.

I will now describe the structure of the Horizon support teams during the period
when Mr Roll was employed by Fujitsu before responding to the specific
suggestions that Mr Roll makes.

The Horizon Support Teams

24.

25.

26.

26.1

There were four lines of support for Horizon while Mr Roll was employed by
Fujitsu and they are described in paragraph 26 below. There are still four lines of
support for Horizon today, albeit that some names have changed and some

responsibilities have moved around teams.

It is common within the industry to have a multi-level support model. Generally,
as you move up through the levels of support the cost of the staff providing the
service increases because they are more qualified. Having said that, there is
often overlap of skills between adjacent lines of support and while a team may be
responsible for a particular level of support, staff within that team can have skills
which allow them to perform a role that is more usually performed by the next

level of support.

The four lines of support for Horizon while Mr Roll was employed were as
follows:-

1* line: The 1“ line involved several different elements:

26.1.1 the Horizon Service Desk (HsbD)' was a helpdesk operated by Fujitsu
that branches could contact with issues relating to the Horizon

application or the hardware provided in branch by Fujitsu to run the

' The HSD has also been known as the Horizon System Helpdesk and the Horizon
Incident Team.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

Horizon application. I estimate that there were around 80 members of
the HSD while Mr Roll was employed, who:-

(a) dealt with straightforward enquiries such as password issues and
scheduling engineers to attend branches to investigate reports of

hardware issues;

(b) monitored the live estate and took corrective actions defined in
knowledge documents (this role was fulfilled by two units: the
System Management Centre (SMC) for data centre events; and
the Counter Eventing Team for Post Office counter events. The
corrective actions did not involve any changes to any branch

transaction data); and
(c) referred other issues to the 2 line support function.

26.1.2 there was also a 1°‘ line Communications Management Team operated
by Fujitsu which specifically focused on communication incidents; and

26.1.3 Post Office also operated a 1“ line helpdesk for operational issues
called the National Business Support Centre (NBSC).

If a branch required assistance to attempt to determine the cause of a
discrepancy they would contact NBSC in the first instance. Discrepancies are not
unusual in a retail system. They indicate a difference between the operator's
declaration of cash and stock on hand and the systems calculation and as such
are a business operation issue. However, it was not always possible for NBSC to
identify the cause of a discrepancy. For example, a user may enter a deposit of
£100 into a customer's bank account on Horizon but rather than taking £100 from
the customer, they may make a mistake and give the customer £100 as if it had
been a withdrawal. In that scenario, NBSC would not have been be able to
identify the cause of a discrepancy. Clearly, NBSC is also unable to assist when
losses have been caused by theft.

If NBSC were unable to identify the cause of a discrepancy they would often fall
back on a default statement along the lines of “this looks like a software issue" so
that the SSC would investigate it. However, Mr Roll's statement that "[i/f an error
was referred to us then it was extremely unlikely to be due to a mistake made by
a postmaster" is not correct. The vast majority of discrepancies investigated by
the SSC as pseudo “software issues” were (and are) not caused by software

issues.

26.3

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

2" Iine: 2" line support was provided by senior members of the HSD and SMC
and junior members of the SSC (as explained below, the SSC also fulfilled a 30
line support function). The 2" line support function mainly involved staff
searching knowledge articles based on the descriptions of issues reported by
branches, gathering evidence and applying simple, well-defined work-arounds
(often on the phone). An example of this would be resetting passwords.

3" line: the SSC also provided 3” line support. The staff that provided 3" line
support had a detailed knowledge of the Horizon application based on
documentation and some inspection of source code. They:-

26.3.1 designed, tested and documented work rounds for the 4! and 2™ lines

of support;

26.3.2 applied analytical skills to the symptoms and evidence gathered by the
14°! and 2™ line functions and undertook in-depth investigation into
incidents (incidents are the basic unit of work for the support team and
come from helpdesk calls and other Horizon support teams);

26.3.3. undertook complex configuration (configuration items can be used to
alter the behaviour of the application) and data fixes which might have
required the generation of special tooling;

26.3.4 designed, wrote and documented new support tools;

26.3.5 undertook source code examination, complex diagnosis and
documentation (including methods to recreate faults) of new application
problems before sending them to the 4" line support group for root
cause software fix; and

26.3.6 provided technical support to other internal Fujitsu teams working on
Horizon.”

The 3“ line support function used a system called Peak (until 2003 it was called
PINICL) to log and manage incidents passed to them which were suspected to be
faults. It also maintained a Known Error Log (KEL) which describes the
symptoms of problems with some analysis of causes, (potential) solutions to the
problems and workarounds that might be needed before a permanent solution

2 An example of this which applies to Horizon Online is support to the Management
Support Unit (MSU) who are responsible for the Reconciliation Process documented in
SVM/SDM/PRO/0020 (Reconciliation and Incident Management Joint Working
Document). The reconciliation process also applied to Legacy Horizon.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

can be implemented. The Peak and KEL systems are still in use today and are
described further in paragraph 62 onwards below.

4" line: 4" line support staff had an intimate knowledge of narrow areas of the
system and were (and are) ultimately responsible for the production of permanent
fixes to repair the root cause of an incident or problem in the live application.
They had knowledge of computer languages which they used to amend source
code to fix problem in the live application code. There was often overlap between
4" line and developers, who added new features into the application.

The structure of the support for Horizon is broadly the same today. One of the
main changes is that the HSD function is no longer operated by Fujitsu (it has

been operated by Atos since June 2014).

Further context — call volumes and transfers

28.

29.

30.

34

Between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2004 (the years Mr Roll worked for
Fujitsu), the SSC received a total of 27,005 calls, meaning that on average 563
calls per month were dealt with over this 4 year period. This is shown by a
spreadsheet prepared by a team in the SSC which appears at Exhibit SPP1 (Tab
"RRP_Live_Peaks_Into_SSC"). Where (as here) I analyse data in this statement,
the analysis is mine.

Transferred calls (i.e. those not resolved by the SSC) are of interest. A very small
proportion of calls transferred to 4” line support would have concerned software
errors requiring resolution, so it would be interesting to know the number of calls
transferred to them. However, while the SSC have records of the volume of
transferred calls, we do not retain records of where they are transferred to and it
is not the case that all of these would have been transferred to 4" line support.
For example, incidents would often arrive at SSC from internal teams for routing
back to helpdesks.

As evidenced by the data in Tab "RRP Live Peaks Out of SSC" of Exhibit SPP1,
an average of 78 calls per month (14%) were transferred to teams outside SSC,
for example, to 2" and 4" line support. This indicates that only a small volume of
calls received and escalated to the SSC related to software errors requiring

resolution.

In terms of calls to the HSD, Fujitsu only holds records of the volume of calls
made to HSD from December 2008 onwards. I understand from my colleague
Sandie Bothick (Fujitsu’s Service Delivery Manager) that the HSD received
13,225 calls in December 2008 and 13,005 in January 2009. The witness
statement of Angele Van Den Bogerd provides that Post Office’s NBSC call

POL00030141
32.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

volume data shows an average of 1,096 calls per day were received in the period
2015 to 2018. While these figures relate to different periods, they indicate that
only a tiny proportion of issues reported to 4" ine support helplines were
escalated to SSC.

From the SSC, only a tiny proportion of incidents were escalated to the 4” fine
support team. It follows that only a tiny fraction of incidents raised actually needed
to be looked at by the only team who might potentially effect changes in software.

The SSC and Mr Roll's role within it

33.

34.

35.

36.

I agree with Mr Roll's recollection that there were around 30 individuals working
on the 6" floor in Bracknell (i.e. in the SSC) at any one time while he was

employed.

As noted above, the SSC team provided both 2° and 3” line support. As with
any mix of people, there are (and were) various levels of talent within SSC. Mr
Roll was primarily used in Operational Business Change (OBC), which involved
supporting the engineers who were opening and closing branches and increasing
and decreasing the number of counters in branches. Mr Roll would also have
been regularly correcting the application environment after engineers had
replaced failed counter hardware and clearing temporary files to increase disk
space. This could fairly be described as 2" line work and it was done by the SSC
because it required a higher level of access to the system than other support
teams had.

Some members of the 3° line support group identified the need for software fixes
via source code examination and would pass this on to the 4" line team for a
code fix to be written. Mr Roll did not play any significant part in this and was not
involved in any extensive source code examination. An application code fix would
not be written by anyone in the 3° line team and he was not involved in the

provision of 4" line support

I disagree with Mr Roll's suggestion that much of the work being carried out by the
SSC while he was employed could be described "as "fire fighting" coding
problems in the Horizon system." There were times when the SSC was very
busy, for example, networking problems causing application issues across the
whole estate and data centre outages. But there were only rare circumstances
where a coding issue had an estate wide impactand, in those instances, Mr Roll
would have been involved executing avoidance actions to mitigate impact to the
estate (i.e. following established work-arounds) rather than working on the root

cause.

The SSC had (and has) access to view, but not amend, source code. Senior
members of the team would have looked at it from time to time to confirm exactly
how the Horizon application would process a given input and what the outputs
would be when investigating specific issues or general education on how the
system works. However, the access was rarely used. Moreover, Mr Roll was not
working at a level where he would be required to review code. His role in the
SSC was predominantly following work around processes designed by other

people and making configuration changes.

In support of the statements above relating to SSC workload I have undertaken
some analysis of the work carried out by SSC between 1 January 2001 and 31
December 2004 (as stated above Mr Roll was employed from 5 March 2001 until
17 September 2004). My colleague John Simpkins provided the summary data
from the Peak system, which I analysed.

When an incident is resolved, the SSC team member (or technician as they are
sometimes called) types a summary of the incident (known as a Final Response)
and allocates a response code to the incident in order to classify it. While
guidance is provided on when to use each response code (see paragraph 64.5
below), allocation is the subjective view of the technician closing the incident and
there is no re-examination of the response codes later to ensure consistency.

With that in mind, the final response codes that were allocated to incidents (i.e.
Peaks) reported to SSC between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2004 were
as follows:-

known issue / work around - 35.3%;
admin - 27.5%

reconciliation - 15.7%;

potential user error - 10.9%;
potential software error - 8.3%; and
hardware error - 1.2%.

It should be noted that:

a major part of 1“ line's raison d'étre is to deal with user error and therefore the
percentage of issues attributable to user error would be much higher at 1" line;

42.

42.1

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

very few hardware incidents reached the SSC because they were the preserve of
the HSD (i.e. they were relatively easy to spot and therefore filtered out by 4 ine
support);

8.3% of calls to the SSC (2252) are attributed to potential software errors over
these four years. This includes duplicates and does not provide any clarity on the
significance of the error corrected. Many software errors, particularly in a new
product, were insignificant, such as correcting capitalisation in printed output. I
cannot be more precise without examining each Peak and even then it might not
be possible to determine how a Peak should have been properly classified
(Peaks are essentially notes made by Fujitsu personnel to chart the progress
made in resolving an issue and these notes can vary in fullness and clarity); and

Classifying an incident as a "potential" software error does not necessarily mean
that there was a software error and, even if there was, it does not mean that the
error was one that could have caused a financial impact in a branch's accounts (a
large proportion of these would be errors in numerous data centre resident
systems that the Subpostmaster never sees — errors were often as trivial as the
use of “Kg” instead of “kg” on receipts). As stated in paragraph 16 above, such
errors were extremely rare. They were all resolved (resolutions include a source
code fix, a configuration fix or a workaround).

Mr Roll's suggestion in paragraph 10 that software issues in Horizon "routinely"
caused discrepancies in branch accounts is misleading. In the vast majority of
cases such an occurrence would cause a receipts and payments (R&P) mismatch
that would be flagged by the branch system as part of the balancing process (the
Horizon system carries out selfconsistency checks which generate alerts in the
event of a receipts and payments mismatch that are picked up by SMC and
incidents raised for the SSC) and appear on MSU reporting. These would then
be investigated and resolved by the SSC.

Since the introduction of Horizon in 1999 there have been 7335 live incidents
which refer to “Payments and Receipt mismatch’ (i.e. incidents recorded against
components of the system providing Horizon service to Post office rather than
incidents raised against test systems). This figure has been obtained using a
textual search across all incidents where the title or one of the incident updates
contains all of the words “receipts”, “payments”, “mismatch”. It should be noted
that this is not 735 unique incidents; there will be a lot of duplicates with the same
root cause. The only way to determine how many unique incidents there were
would be to manually review all of the incidents. All of them were resolved.

These incidents are reported as a result of self-consistency checks carried out by
Horizon. It should be noted that a R&P mismatch is not only caused by a
software error. It can also be caused by incorrect product reference
(configuration) data

Receipts and payments mismatches happened more often during the early life of
Horizon (see Tab “All RnP by RCode and Date” of Exhibit SPP1). My analysis of
that data shows that there were around 8.6 such incidents per month on average
between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2004 (417 out of a total of 27,005
incidents into SSC or 1.5% of SSC incidents during that period).

Mr Roll refers to a "perception...that the Service Level Agreements between Post
Office Ltd and Fujitsu involved financial penalties payable by Fujitsu to Post
Office" (paragraph 12). I am aware that there were Service Level Agreements for
issues such as stuck transactions (Fujitsu had 10 days to retrieve transactions
that had not replicated from a counter). It is quite normal for contracts such as
the one between Fujitsu and Post Office relating to Horizon to have such
agreements. The same level of diligence was (and is) applied to all incidents,
whether an SLA was relevant of not. The possibility of financial penalties was
never a factor for the SSC.

I do not understand what Mr Roll means when he says that “any discrepancy in
the post office accounts had to be resolved speedily" (paragraph 12). There was
(and is) a process run by the Management Support Unit (MSU) which involves
examination of various system reporting and may result in Business Incident
Management Service (BIMS) entries going to Post Office. An incident may also
be raised by MSU with the SSC to provide support to the MSU in resolution of the
BIMS. These are subject to Service Level Agreements and Mr Roll may be
referring to this process. However, if Mr Roll is suggesting that Fujitsu routinely
rushed out fixes or workarounds due to SLA time pressure, that is not the case.
Fixes would be expedited based on service impact. It would be quite wrong to
suggest that they were not done properly because of any SLAs.

It is correct that there are a limited number of opportunities to release software
updates and that these releases could take 6 weeks or more to be released to the
live service (Mr Roll’s statement, paragraph 13). These longer timescales would
be employed for non-urgent updates wrapped up into a consistent set for
deployment. On those rare occasions when a problem has an impact on the
financial integrity of the system a “hot fix" would be deployed which involved
much shorter timescales. I would expect a timescale measured in days not weeks
to deploy a hot-fix. Mr Roll also states that a bug could reappear several weeks

after a coding fix had been released due to software issues. I am aware of only
one or two cases where a fix regressed in my time at Fujitsu.

In paragraph 14 Mr Roll states, "/ would reiterate that the main recurring issues
were software issues." It is a symptom of working within a software support team
that the majority of issues that come in have been attributed to a software issue
by, for example, a lower line of support. This can lead to a mind set of “look at all
these Horizon errors”, but what this indicates to me is that the previous levels of
support are functioning correctly, removing the majority of other causes (user /
hardware problems). It does not indicate that the majority of Horizon errors could
be attributed to software.

Mr Roll states (paragraph 7) that "[sjoftware programs were written by us to strip-
out irrelevant data, to enable us to more easily locate the error." The support
tools are used to filter information and present information to technicians in ways
that make the support process easier. I am aware of two support tools (also
known as software programs) that were written while Mr Roll was employed by
Fujitsu:-

the Smiley support tool written by my colleague John Simpkins, which
amalgamates information from various sources (e.g. databases) into a single
view pertinent to a particular support task and provides a unified interface to run
various tools to achieve a single support outcome; and

another tool (I cannot remember its name) written by my colleague Richard
Coleman whose function was to retrieve messages (i.e. data) from the
correspondence server to local text files for examination and which was

eventually subsumed into the Smiley support tool.

Neither of these tools changed the underlying data in a branch's accounts.

Mr Roll states that he would investigate financial discrepancies that had arisen in
branches by "work[ing] sequentially through all transactions over the relevant
period, and also work[ing] through thousands of lines of computer coding’
(paragraph 7).

It is not the role of the SSC to routinely investigate discrepancies.

In very rare circumstances a discrepancy could be caused by a software issue
and in those circumstances it might be necessary for the 4" line support function
to work through thousands of lines of computer coding to determine the root

cause. However, Mr Roll would not have worked through thousands of lines of
computer coding to investigate a discrepancy in a branch: he did not work in the
4" line.

Mr Roll further states that if SSC was "unable to find the cause of the discrepancy
then this was reported up the chain and it was assumed that the postmaster was
to blame" (paragraph 10). That is not my experience: it is a simple truth of support
that the majority of issues reported in a system are attributable to user action or
user misunderstanding of system functionality. Hence, someone working in a
support environment analysing a new issue would examine the possibilities of
user error as a first hypothesis but any final conclusion is only generated based
on the evidence. Where the evidence does not support aconclusion that there is
a problem with Horizon, the SSC feeds the existent factual data back to Post
Office and might say something along the lines of "all indications are that the
branch has made a mistake", but Fujitsu neither attributes "blame" or agrees the

final conclusion with the Postmaster

When an incident is resolved, the SSC team member (or technician as they are
sometimes called) types a summary of the incident (known as a Final Response)
and allocates a response code to the incident in order to classify it. While
guidance provided on when to use each response code, allocation is the
subjective view of the technician closing the incident and there is no re-
examination of the response codes later to ensure consistency.

The Peaks that Mr Roll works on while employed by Fujitsu indicate that he dealt
with 915 incidents (see Tab "Final Responses" of Exhibit SPP1). To give some
clarity on these incidents I have analysed their final response codes that were

allocated to them by Mr Roll. He classified them as follows:-

Response code % allocated

by Mr Roll
Known issue / work around 61.9
Reconciliation 14.5
Admin 9.3
Potential software error 3.2

This supports my recollection that Mr Roll mainly followed work-arounds devised
by other people (61.9%) and that he was rarely involved in the detailed
examination of potential software errors (3.2%). As explained in paragraph 41.4
above ‘potential’ software errors do not necessarily mean software errors, let

alone software errors resulting in discrepancies to branch accounts.

55.3

I understand from Post Office's solicitors that the term "remote access" has been
used to describe Fujitsu and Post Office carrying out the following actions when

not physically present in a branch:-
accessing branch data in read-only mode;
inserting new transaction data; and

editing or deleting existing transaction data.

As noted above, it is correct that Fujitsu had (and has) the ability to view data in
branches remotely given their support role.

Mr Roll claims that "[djuring the course of resolving the software issues, we would
frequently access a Post Office counter IT system remotely" (paragraph 15). Mr
Roll gives the example of ("when a binary bit would "flip", thus a "1" became a
"O") =

This probably relates to a condition known as a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
error which would happen when a hard drive became faulty at a branch counter.
Although this is a hardware problem, remedial action was needed by the SSC to
resolve. To clarify, this process did not involve changing any transaction data.

As explained by Mr Godeseth in paragraph 35 of his statement, in Legacy
Horizon:-

55.2.1 all counter data was held in a bespoke message store in each branch?
and the data was replicated to all counter positions in the branch and
from the branch to the data centres where it was held in
correspondence server message stores;

55.2.2 any data inserted into the message store at the data centre (for
example reference data or authorisations for banking transactions)
would be replicated back to the branch counters; and

55.2.3. selected data was extracted from the correspondence servers to
update Post Office's back end systems.

If one of the sets of data on a branch counter became corrupted it would
generate an event that would be picked up by the SMC and/or reported to HSD

3A message means data and transaction data is asubset of the data in the message

store.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

by the branch (an incident reporting a “CRC Error’). There were a total of 629
CRC errors over the life of Legacy Horizon (see Tab "All CRC by Date" of Exhibit
SPP1).

The issue would be reported to the SSC, who would delete the entire set of data
on that counter and replace it with a copy of the data from one of the other
sources that had not been corrupted. While this process involves deleting and
replacing a set of data, no new data is produced; all that happens is that the
replicated data is used to replace the data that has become corrupted from
another counter in the branch. It would have been necessary forthe SSC to
inform a branch before carrying out this task because it is likely that any attempt
to use that counter would fail while the process was being carried out. In Mr Rolls
capacity as an OBC specialist, he would have been involved in this type of

activity.

Alternatively, Mr Roll's reference to a binary code flipping may relate to a
configuration item (an item that can change the behaviour of the application)
which can become locked in the wrong binary setting (1, 0) One example of
which would be a stock unit lock which, in the wrong state, would prevent
updates to stock units within a branch. This issue was corrected by a member of
the SSC accessing Horizon remotely, but it did not involve accessing or editing
transaction data in any way or re-creating databases.

I cannot think of any other examples of incidents that Mr Roll may be referring to
in paragraph 15.

Mr Roll claims that “some errors were corrected remotely without the sub-

postmaster being aware" (paragraph 16).

It may be that Mr Roll is referring to issues relating to the end of day concept in
Legacy Horizon. Essentially there was a cut-off point for transactions every day
at 7:00pm and each counter had to write an end of day message to the branch's
master counter to enable the master counter to write a branch end of day
message, which would then trigger the data centre to harvest messages
(including details of transactions) to Post Office's back end systems.
Occasionally a counter in a branch would fail to write an end of day message and
there was a process for correcting this. The issue would be reported to SSC by
way of an incident (either as a result of a call to HSD or sometimes Fujitsu could
spot issues via system events).

56.2

57.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

In lay terms, SSC would force the counter to generate a report based on the data
already in the counter. A message injected in this way would go into the audit
trail. This would not alter the branch's transaction data.

Mr Roll also states that, there were some errors where it was necessary to
“download and correct the data and prepare it for uploading back on to the post
office computer, then call the postmaster to inform him that there was problem
and that we needed two or three minutes to correct it' (paragraph 17).

57.1 _ It is not clear what errors Mr Roll is referring to or how he says they
were corrected. The issue referred to could be another instance
where the work round of re-creating transaction data from a
replicated copy was required as described in paragraphs 55.3 and
55.4 above.

SUMMARY

58.

In summary, the suggestion that Fujitsu would manipulate a branch's transaction
data in a way which was detrimental to a particular Postmaster and undetectable

is wrong.

58.1 All support action taken by Fujitsu is directed to ensuring that legitimate
transactions entered by Subpostmasters are correctly processed by the Horizon
application and correctly passed to other POL systems as appropriate.

58.2 Any financial corrections required are communicated by Fujitsu to Post Office for
execution or approval.

58.3 Any support intervention that requires the insertion of a transaction is identifiable
in the audit trail.

58.4 There is no financial incentive for a support technician to circumvent the controls
within the system.

58.5 There are strong controls in place to prevent intervention by support staff with
malicious intent or misguided attempts at financial gain

59. The statement that issues with coding in the Horizon system were extensive and
impacted branch finances is incorrect for the reasons stated above.

KELS AND PEAKS

60. I have been asked by Post Office's solicitors to provide some more information on

the two toolsets used to support the Horizon system, the KEL knowledge base

AC_152871086_1 17

POL00030141
POL00030141
POL00030141
POL00030141

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

(AKA KEL) and the incident management system (PINICL / Peak). This
information is applicable to both Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online except
where explicitly stated otherwise.

61. Fujitsu use a custom solution, developed and administrated by the SSC, which
allows us to record support knowledge into a structure known as a KEL (Known
Error Log). KELs record support knowledge which is intended to assist staff in
the support and understanding of the Horizon system. KELs do not contain the
history of an incident (see my analysis of the Peak system below). KELs are
generated for a number of reasons, for example: to explain system behaviour or
messages that originate from central and counter systems, to record symptoms
and outcomes from incidents referred by help desks or identified as a result of
Fujitsu's reconciliation processes; and to record information on issues seen in test
environments (resolved before the feature is passed on to users).

61.1. The acronym KEL is a misnomer inherited from a previous system. KEL entries
are support knowledge entries and do not have a one to one relationship with
errors on the system. There are a lot more general supporting knowledge KELs
than KELs relating to specific errors.

61.2 Guidelines for the generation and use of KELs are documented in
SVM/SDM/PRO/0875 (End to End Support Strategy) section 11 Knowledge Base
Maintenance. Although some aspects of this document need revision due to
changes in the support structure for Horizon, Section 11 is still fundamentally
correct in relation to Horizon.

61.3 KELs reflect community sourced knowledge to assist staff involved in the support
of the Horizon solution. There are no mandated rules for when a KEL should be
created other than a desire to make resolving a problem easier for all concerned.
Guidelines exist in SVM/SDM/PRO/0875. Any KELs created or updated are
referred to the SSC for approval to provide a basic check that the information at
the time of the change is valid.

61.4 KELs can be created by the senior people in HSD (2% line) to supplement their
own knowledge base (rather than taking an active role in the KEL process) and
the SMC monitoring team. The 1“ line helpdesk function do not create KELs
(HSD 1“ line used their own knowledge base).

61.5 AKEL is a living document that reflects support knowledge at a given point in
time. KELs are not designed to provide a history of a particular symptom or
support process and a particular KEL cannot be considered the definitive source
containing all possible information regarding the problem it addresses. It is up to

AC_152871086_1 18
POL00030141
POL00030141

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

the technician to check other potentially relevant KELs and information sources
(e.g. support guides) and use their analytical skills to determine the right course
of action to take in a given situation.

61.6 There have been historic requests to remove large numbers of KELs based on
date updated to reduce the number of search results that are returned to help
desks when naive search terms were used. The dates given in the KELs, while
an indicator of potentially irrelevant support information, are not precise. This led
to the concept of “deactivated” KELs (deactivated KELs are removed from the
default searches support people use although the user interface allows the user
to explicitly request a search to include deactivated KELs). At the time of writing,
there are 113 deactivated Legacy Horizon KELs and 1024 deactivated Horizon
Online KELs.

61.7 For most of its lifetime, there has been no fixed routine for the review of KELs. If
a technician recognises an inaccurate KEL as they analyse information they are
expected to update in order to improve the knowledge base. Approximately 2
years ago the KEL review forum was introduced. This forum meets weekly to
review KELs and update or deactivate as appropriate.

61.8 Before creating a KEL there is an expectation that the creator will search the
existing information to ensure that it is not duplicated. Because people express
information using different words, it is not possible for the system to perform such
acheck. Human fallibility and unique expression mean that duplicated
information is present in the KEL system.

61.9 Archiving: There is no requirement to keep historic support information. Once an
item is no longer relevant to current systems it can be removed without any
implications to the support of the system. KELs are deleted when they have no
value to the support of the current systems. This can happen at any time and is
carried out by the SSC who are the final arbiters of what information is currently
relevant. That does not mean that all current KELs are still relevant; it may be
that irrelevant KELs have not been deleted yet. At the time of writing there are
1,491 deleted KELs.

61.10 KEL entries have a single field to record an incident (Peak) reference. This is not
a record of all incidents the KEL is relevant to. Generally, it is used to record the
Peak that was being investigated when the KEL was created or updated. This is
a manual entry and is not checked by the system because a KEL may not have
an associated incident. There is no requirement to update the KEL when
information in it is re-used to provide guidance on a different incident.

62. Peak (not an acronym) is browser-based software incident and problem
management system used by Post Office Account for all development, test and
support teams except the 1" line help desk. It enables details of the incident and
diagnostic progress to be captured in a searchable format and allows the tracking
of problems from detection through to resolution. Peak was developed in-house
by the SSC from the PinICL system it replaced in 2003. The system has been
customised and enhanced over its 15 years of operation andstill continues to be

developed to Post Office Account requirements today.
62.1 When Peak was implemented, data from PINICL was migrated to Peak.

62.2 One source of Peak incidents are the 1° line support teams (including the HSD
the NBSC helplines). Peak is also used to process incidents generated by other
support units, monitoring and testing teams.

62.3 The structure of a Peak enforces a workflow (it gives a process structure leading
to a defined outcome). As a result, the Peak system has also been used to
record and progress other items loosely associated with incident management.
For example, Release management process, reference data delivery process,
Post Office Data Gateway route definition process. So the Peak system contains
incidents which do not directly impact the Horizon service provided to the Post
Office counters (AKA “Live service”). These additional types of “incident” are
differentiated by the Peak type: L = Live service, R = Release management etc

62.4 For most of its life cycle a Peak is assigned to a particular support team anda
person within that team who is responsible for the next action om the incident. As
the incident is progressed by various members of the support community, they
add textual comments and supporting evidence to the Peak to document the
progress of the incident. These updates are date / time stamped and forma
record of the diagnostic and resolution process. Progress updates cannot be
deleted / amended by users once committed to Peak. A Peak may also be
transferred between teams and people as it progresses to final resolution.

62.5 _ A final response code (numeric) is applied to an incident when it has reached its
conclusion along with text that supports the response code. Response codes are
the subjective opinion of the person closing the incident and are not subject to
review but they remain the best way to classify the final outcome of an incident.
Response codes and their expected usage are documented in
SVM/SDM/PRO/0875 (End to End Support Strategy) in Section 9 Incident closure
categories. Although some aspects of this document need revision due to
changes in the support structure for Horizon, Section 9 is still fundamentally
correct and is relevant to Horizon (Legacy and Online).

The Peak system has no archiving policy. Effective incident management
requires that you can track the current issues and those from the recentpast.
Data retention on Peak has been impacted by a lack of disk space, the primary
cause being large evidence files attached to Peaks. I am told by my colleague

who maintains the Peak system that-

62.6.1 encrypted evidence files are removed one month after the incident is

closed; and

62.6.2 due to disk space issues in the past it has been necessary to remove
evidence attached to older Peaks.

KEL references can be added to a Peak entry. There is no system check to
ensure a KEL has been added since KELs are not relevantto all incidents being
processed.

Incident priorities and appropriate usage are described in SVM/SDM/PRO/0875
(End to End Support Strategy) in Section 7 and SVM/SDM/PRO/0018 (Incident
Management Process). Incidents with a financial impacton branches are treated
as high priority.

Target times to resolve software incidents are described in SVM/SDM/PRO/0875
(End to End Support Strategy) in Section 8.

I have been shown paragraph 5.114 of Mr Coyne’s report, in which he says that
he has analysed 5,114 KELs to determine the scope and impact of potential
Peaks. Mr Coyne explains that out of these 5,114 KELs, he believes he has found
163 that could be of "significant interest" and that he has referred to 76 of these in
his report.

with a list of KELs that they have identified as being referred to in the report
(Coyne KELs). I do not know why there appears to be a difference between this
number and the number of 76 quoted by Mr Coyne.

It is not clear what Mr Coyne means by “significant interest’. \t may be that he
means that a KEL presents evidence of a bug, error or defect in Horizon that has

There is an acknowledgment that
cash declaration discrepancies
could be due to an "Unknown

By way of context, this is a generic KEL relating to the handling of calls

concerning discrepancies. There are a number of possible causes for

unexplained discrepancies between the cash declaration and figures on

SAP, including

‘+ Subpostmaster has made an incorrect declaration

* Transactions as recorded on the system do not match what actually
happened at the branch

‘+ Outstanding recovery

+ Known system problem (these should be monitored for or be easy to
spot from events etc.)

‘+ Unknown system problem

This term “unknown system problem” is a term that the KEL creator would
have used to indicate that the issue may have been caused by a new
(previously undetected) defect, that would follow the normal diagnosis
process and will then become a known system problem once fixed.

The relevant Peak (PC.0202239) relates to an investigation surrounding
the possible explanation of a £240 discrepancy. The investigation
concluded that the discrepancy was likely to have been caused by human
error and it appears that the Postmaster accepted this conclusion.

Response to Mr Coyne

Financial impact on branch
accounts

18] seng2037L
and
acha959T

5.43

These KELs describe how various
transaction states may also indicate
a failed recovery

These are both generic KELs describing how support should process
specific scenarios found on reconciliation reports. These reports are
generated daily for banking/debit card/e top up transactions where the
counters, agent and financial information (Fl) feeds differ in some way (for
example, the counter timed out a transaction but the Fi authorised it and
ring fenced the funds). They are sent daily to the security opera tions
team. Each transaction is checked and sometimes further investigation is
required from the SSC team via a Peak.

These KELs describe legitimate states that can occur during reconciliation
following a failed transaction which is usually recovered from correctly
There are 23 legitimate (normal process) states and 39 error states that a
transaction can enter. Each state has a specific meaning depending upon
the responses from the Counter, TPS and Fl. A legitimate state would be
that the TPS and Counter both know about a transaction but the Fl may
never send information about it (state 6); this is a legitimate state but it
would warrant investigation.

There would be no impact if the user

Example of a declined network
banking

transaction that resulted in money
being taken from the customer's
account.

‘An error in network banking caused the customer's account to be debited
although the transaction failed at the branch and th e Postmaster was told
at the counter that the transaction failed. Banking transactions with a
response code of 26 (Fl Unavailable, Try again later) would be recorded
as zero value transactions at the branch, a DECLINED receipt would have
been produced and so no money should have been handed over to the
customer. Therefore no impact on branch accounts. On rare occasions
the financial institution may have debited or credited the customer bank
account despite us not receiving the authorisation. in these instan ces, if
the automatic reversals fail to resolve matters then the issue would be
picked up as part of the DRS reconciliation process meaning Fujitsu would
inform Post Office of what has happened at the counter so that they can
liaise with the financial institution to ensure their systems match so
customer is not out of pocket. The root cause was between the NBE and
the Fi, which is outside of Horizon

When recovering a failed counter, the user is asked to input data from a
receipt. To handle poor typing there is a check sum which should ensure
that it has not been altered. This bug re lates to the fact that not all the
data entered is controlled by the check sum. Therefore, when a tester
deliberately input incorrect data, the system did not detect it. NB this did
not include financial data.
