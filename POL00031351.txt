Attachments: Judgment: Post Office -v- Lee Castleton

Lesley,

The ruling with Castleton is attached along with a summary. There were extensive allegations made in
relation to Horizon being the cause of the losses, all of which are reviewed point by point in the
judgement. with regards the specific point on a system bug, our witness recalls that this was discussed
under cross examination so should be in the witness statements if not in the ruling.

The most relevant part on quick read seems to be point 23.

Regards,

James Davidson

Alwen,

I understand the bug was spoken about in the Castelton case (I wasn't personally involved). It was
definitely spoken about in the Misra case where it was interrogated about it at length. Other cases
where it was mentioned were settled out of court as far as I know.

Does that clarify things?

Regards
Gareth

The question was really about whether the defect had been spoken about in open court other than in the
Misra case as it helps that it was in the public domain and not ‘covered up’ in any way

Thanks

Simon,

I'm not aware of any other specific bugs being discussed in court (either related to Horizon or HNG-X).
The Falkirk bug was first raised in the Castleton Civil case and was then picked up on for a number of
subsequent Criminal cases even through it was irrelevant to those environments. Defence experts were
using it as an example that Horizon has had bugs.

Gareth

You mention discussing the falkirk bug in the Misra case today, are there any other examples where bugs
have been discussed in court.
