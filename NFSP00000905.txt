Guidance for NFSP members re historic losses

Dear colleague

We have received a handful of enquiries today from current and former
subpostmasters seeking to understand their options in relation to losses
within their post office businesses that they were held responsible for
by Post Office Ltd (PO).

Any current or former subpostmasters who believe they have been held
responsible for losses within their post office business that were no
fault of their own should contact NBSC on { ito raise the
issue.

These enquiries come off the back of the announcement earlier today that
a settlement has been reached that brings to an end the Group Litigation
Order (GLO) in Bates v Post Office.

(See https: //www.onepostoffice.co.uk/secure/latest-news/general-
news/joint-statement/ for further information)

Despite the settlement announced today, the verdict on the second case
within the GLO (the ‘Horizon issues’ trial) hasn’t yet been revealed. We
can expect the verdict to be handed down on Monday 16 December and I will
provide a further update to NFSP members next week.

Yours faithfully

GRO
