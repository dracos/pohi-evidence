Branch Support Programme -Background (2)

To address the concerns of some subpostmasters over recent years about
Horizon, the Post Office commissioned forensic accountants, Second Sight in 2012
to undertake an independent review of the cases.

The interim report was published in July 2013 and whilst the report identified
that there were no systemic issues with the Horizon system, it suggested that
Post Office should examine the training and support offered to it subpostmasters.

As a result the Branch Support Programme was established to review

the lifecycle of the subpostmaster'’s experience with Post Office; to “fix” the issues

identified in the Second Sight report and the subsequent mediation cases and

to ensure any lessons learnt are factored into future ways of working. Improvements
that

were already in train as part of business as usual were brought into the scope of the

Branch Support Programme.

A LEAN approach has been used to map the critical business processes within the
scope of the 9 programme work streams to ensure that the most cost effective
process is delivered to reduce non-value add activity. This methodology also
helps to embed the principles of continuous improvement within the relevant ws

Branch Support Programme - Purpose & Guiding (2)
Principtes
Purpose

The purpose of the Branch Support Programme (BSP) is to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of the support we provide to subpostmasters
and operators in the running of their Post Offices from an operational and
engagement perspective.

Guiding Principles

There are three guiding principles that underpin our new ways of working approach
and how we interact with our subpostmasters and others. These principles are to be
embedded in all areas of the Post Office. The outputs of the Programme will be
tested against each of these principles:

* Treat with dignity & respect at all times
+ Stand in Spmr’s shoes

+ Right first time

at the same reduce the rate of errors and losses which will deliver both a
financial and a resource benefit in chasing those errors
