All, would it be possible to set up a conference call for Friday at say 12.30pm to discuss this? If so, I will ask Amanda if
she would be able to set something up for us.

Thanks

Belinda I agree with Andy - I’d like to avoid giving anything if at all possible (less is more), but if we do, rather than give
them the data they’ve asked for, we should provide MI which gives context, incl:

- rather than raw three year data, give the monthly average over the past 3/5 years

- what that figure is as a proportion of total month end transactions; and

- average time to clear sums in suspense

e.g. something along these lines: “The amount held in suspense accounts across the Post Office network averages £XX

per Trading Period, or approx. Y% of the total value of the transactions processed each Trading Period. Of the sums held
in suspense accounts, approx. Z % is cleared within 30 days, and all but F% is cleared within 90 days”.

Charles/Rod

Second Sight have now comeback on the paper and asked for information on the suspense account. Specifically "can we

have details of month end balances for this account for the last 3 years together with details of amounts released to
P&L"

Charles had previously suggested providing a ballpark figure, but if we do that we would have to wrap a significant
amount of information around that as context. However, Andy Parsons has sketched out a suggested response below. I
do not know whether the published accounts give any details or whether we do ever make this information otherwise
available but I would be grateful for advice on how best to respond.

I think that we should consider this through the lens of an Fol request and how we would respond to that. Anyone could
ask the question (and may have done so in the past) therefore we need to be sure that whatever response we give
would not result in less information being released than if they requested the information under FolA.

Second Sight are producing a draft report either today or tomorrow which is likely to reference this so we will need to
have a response within the next couple of days.

Best wishes

As discussed briefly yesterday, I suspect that the information requested by lan below is highly commercial sensitive.

It may also be that the figures in question are quite high and this may then be portrayed as if there are significant sums
each month that cannot be reconciled within POL's accounts. The inference from this is that POL's processes /
accounting systems are flawed given the volume of discrepancies. Whether or not this is correct, it is an easy leap to
make.

Assuming that POL finance say that this info cannot be disclosed, I've penned out a short response to lan below.

Kind regards
Andy

lan

The information you are seeking is highly commercially sensitive and therefore would only be made available in
exceptional circumstances.

As described in the Suspense Account Note provided to you, sums in POL's suspense account do not impact on branch
accounting but reflect unresolved matters between POL and its clients. I'd be grateful if you could explain why SS need
visibility of the suspense account figures given that the Part 2 Report and the CRRs are only focussed on the impact on
SPMRs.

Kind regards
Andy

Thank you Belinda, very helpful

In the light of the disclosure of rolling 3 year suspense account can we have details of month end balances for this
account for the last 3 years together with details of amounts released to P&L
