Migration Update:
Two Live office migrations were
attempted last night:
¢ Coton House was successful
and is performing well
e Brownsover successfully
regressed back to Horizon.
The branch opened back at
Horizon and was able to trade
as normal.

For Information

140.03

info

Migration Update:

e Brownsover’s migration to
Horizon Online failed due to a
problem with the Security
Policy Version on one or more
of its counters.

e A fix is known for this issue
and it can be applied without
any impact on the counter
however, the fix is untested
and therefore carries some
risk (albeit very low) that it
could fail to work, resulting in
targeted branches requiring
this fix to fail to migrate.

For Information

140.04

info

In the light of 140.03, the Joint Steering Board
agreed that the possibility of 9 migrations
failing ( branches have been reported to have
the Security Policy configuration issue) would
be unacceptable from a PR stand point and
hence it was agreed to proceed as follows:
e Branches to go ahead tonight;
o Lapworth (unaffected by
Security Policy Issue)
o Fenton
o Ombersley Road
e Remaining 8 branches previously targeted
for tonight will go Friday night / Saturday
morning.

successful. Any issues must be
raised before 07:30 to enable a
decision to be made on the three
branches that were migrated
overnight.

140.06

AD

Ensure WR and MB are informed (as.
soon as possible) if any of the
migrations fails. The programme
team need to be informed before
contacting the target branches.

AD
(GW)

Provide a process for how releases
will be implemented beyond the
current maintenance release (01.08).
Process will need to be discussed
and agreed with POL Service
Delivery.

New Item

21/01

140.09

AD

The delay in the commencement of
Volume testing means that we will not
be able to perform a significant
amount of testing before commencing
the Medium Volume Pilot. Hence we
will need a significant amount of data
to be collected from the Live
Branches and Data Centre. The data
will also require careful and thorough
analysis.

AD to confirm how this will be
achieved.
