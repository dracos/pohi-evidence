SUBJECT: HORIZON - TECHNICAL CONCURRENCE

dk

During my meeting with Alan Shepherd on Thursday, I raised the issue
of technical concurrence for Horizon to check Alan was happy about its
state of state of progress.

He said he broadly was, though there were some outstanding issues
around additional technical testing and monitoring which he thought
looked like they were being addressed but would not be settled for
another couple of months or so ( further to a meeting with you and Gael
Stewart). Can you clarify please, with the PDA and him what's the
specific timed deliverable that will clear this, and milestone that in the
PDA? I fear it will become confusingly vague otherwise.

Ialso explained to him Tim and Min’s work in developing a testing
approach both for Horizon and its interfaces (in Pathway and the PDA),
and then the testing to ensure integrity with our own existing or new
systems and processes that needs to be done in POCL. I promised that
once this was buttoned down, we would run through this with him in
detail to assure him - could you arrange this please, via Tim? It may add
value for me if Wendy’s team attend too.

Finally, Alan raised the good point about contingency planning in the
event on non-acceptance of trial (or else you get forced to accept
anyway!). Could you take this forward with the PDA please.
