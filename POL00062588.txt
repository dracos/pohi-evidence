One needs to deal here with caution.

Obviously SS not entitled to anything which is subject to Legal privilege.

SS is not entitled to see documents or issues which are properly in the domain of Lawyers and not accountants or
computer experts because their degree of understanding and interpretation they place on this material will be wrong in
law as has already been demonstrated.

Regards.

Andy,

My view is that if a document has previously been disclosed then we should provide to SS; not to do so
would look suspect.

Subject: M012 - further disclosure [BD-4A.FID25886904]

Angela Van-Den-Bogerd: Kathryn Alexander;

All

In response to SS' request for additional documents, please find attached the list of potential further
disclosure for M012 (Misra).

My concern with releasing this information is that it includes the technical IT evidence of Gareth Jenkins
and Misra's expert McLachlin (who, by the way, was the "IT expert" who turned up on the One

Show). This information has obviously already been disclosed to Misra but, as far as we are aware, not
to SS (save for the first part of McLachlin's report that was sent with her CQR). It may therefore open up
some further lines of enquiry for SS but I don’t think we can avoid that — its clearly relevant to the case
and was used in Court. The evidence was good enough for a jury and therefore I think we need to
release it to SS on the assumption that it will stand up to scrutiny.

Belinda / Angela — any thoughts on the above?

Martin / Kath — In general, I'd be grateful for your views on whether any of the individual documents
should not be disclosed.

Electronic copies of documents to follow by 4 separate emails — encrypted with the usual password.

Kind regards
Andy
