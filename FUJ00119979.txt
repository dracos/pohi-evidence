2. ISSUES ARISING FROM SERVICE REPORT
Highlights of previous period’s service statistics, concentrating on failures to meet required service levels, including major incidents reported, service
trends and service achievements

Management Summary
© Increased number of training calls - LT asked if there was any further information on why this had increased so much. RB explained that the increase is still under

Rectification Plans
+ ICL Pathway have received the response from POL regarding changes to some of the wording but didn’t feel that there were any problems so hopefully this is now
close to resolution.

System Service

¢ LT asked what the failures relating to Energis were. PW explained that most of the problems had occurred over one weekend when Energis had restricted the
network. Engineers trying to swap base units could not get through and download the information successfully. Energis should not have done this without
informing ICL Pathway and PW is taking this up with them to ensure it doesn’t happen again. LT asked if a process could be developed to let POL know in
advance if this was going to happen but PW explained that realistically ICL Pathway would not know in advance because it would be a fault, not a planned
occurrence.

Emulators

© PWexplained that the CCN had not yet been signed off and the pilot has not commenced although a test is due to take place in Stevenage on 06/12/01. He asked
for POL’s views on running the pilot throughout December. LT replied that it would depend on how intrusive the pilot is going to be - PW explained that it
would be during opening hours but would not take out a counter position or impede on customer service. POL agreed in principle that the pilot could be run
throughout December but will assess the implications after the test on 06/12/01. PW agreed to confirm if ICL Pathway will not start the pilot until the CCN is
signed off and DG requested that a representative from BSM and the Retail Line would be there to witness the test - LT to discuss with Mick Theobald. See
APO11101.

e SLA Exclusions - RB asked what the current status of the document review was - LT amd MB have given feedback on the document to the Commercial team -
MB to check progress. See AP011102.

se SLA’s are not being reported on LT asked if there would have been any impact on them by going into fallback mode because of the OBCS failure
and whether there was any report which could be produced to show this. RB replied that there would not be an impact and that he would not be able to produce a
report which would give a true view of the situation.

LFS.
*  LTasked if the Cash on Hand problem had been fixed by S10R - RB replied that he would not know until the full estate had received S10R (early December)
Reporting will commence in January 2002 but he agreed to give an indication next month on whether or not it has worked. See APO11103

Release Timetable

° BI Datacentre migration has been successful

¢  BI1 Live estate has been put back by one week but there are no problems

¢ SI0R - 35 outlets remaining of which a high percentage are closed or temporarily closed

© Unattended Reboots - a riposte message will now occur to inform counters that it has taken place but they will also still receive a memoview message. MR
investigating as there will be no requirement for this.

¢ Sep/Oct 2002 release - any CR’s for this need to be completed by December 2001 for inclusion

* Banking Release - the Banking team and ICL Pathways dates do not agree , this is being sorted out. This release also clashes with the cash account release for that
year.

¢ Your Guide - all releases are updates to the current pilot offices which should have no effect on the counter. A decision has not been made yet on full roll out and
discussions are ongoing re the pilot.

3. REVIEW FORUM FEEDBACK
To discuss issues escalated from the Operational Review Forums

* As there was feedback missing from a couple of forums $$ agreed to talk to the chairperson of all forum to ensure they are included in future. See APO11104.

4. OBCS FAILURE
To identify learning points and improvements

Key findings from both POL and ICL Pathway reports were:
¢ Problems were associated with the Scavenger tool
© Communication to offices and Senior Managers internally in both POL and ICL Pathway must be quicker
¢ The release of message broadcasts to outlets must be quicker
¢ A review of which option should be used on SPOC to assist call handling should be undertaken
-ompleting a full review of the Problem.
ed if there would be an impact on TIP data delivery SLA’s and RB replied that even though the data will have been rejected, because it was actually
received it would still record an achieved SLA - JW to factor this into the review. PW stated that the associated helpdesk SLA’s would fail.
¢ DGalso noted that there had been some confusion in whether a re-boot was required or not and PW explained that there had been unnecessary confusion in ICL
Pathway which had caused delays in the MBS message. RB confirmed that associated re-boots would be reported in November's SRB but it was unclear whether

or not outlets told to reboot by NBSC were also told to inform HSH that they had done this - if not then these reboots would not be counted in the SLA calculation.
This will also be factored into the review.

PW agreed to check the history of Scavenger and identify any lessons learned to prevent similar occurrences in the future. He also agreed to find out what activity
reports (if any) Scavenger produces and how the information is used.

MBS was nol targeted to offices affected (i.e. Northern Ireland offices told unnecessarily) - this will also be included in the review.

Impacts of the failure are still being evaluated.

NRO

To track progress of Horizon roll out to the remaining offices

¢ NRO Plan - 7 offices remaining, 2 scheduled for December, 1 scheduled for January 2002 and 4 with no planned dates.

* LT explained that concerns had been expressed by Territory representatives about the offices left to migrate via OBC procedures. PW was not aware of any major
issues and LT and PW agreed to discuss the issues after the meeting to help progress the outstanding offices.

6. ISSUES FOR REFERRAL TO THE CONTRACT BOARD

To identify issues for escalation.

None

7. SERVICE IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES

Suggestions for improvement to the Service

ICL Pathway Scorecard

¢ DGexplained that this had been a difficult and thought provoking exercise, When completeing the scoring it had been difficult to make a distinction between
Corporate ICL Pathway and individuals and teams within ICL Pathway.

* PW gave a view of what he felt the scores should be and then DG went through the scores which POL had given with explanations of why particular scores had
been allocated.

© DG said that POL would be happy to complete the scorecards on an ongoing basis but asked PW to consider whether or not it was the right framework. PW
replied that the suggested format could change as it needed to reflect what was important to POL. One suggestion from POL was to end up with the top 3
improvement opportunities for ICL Pathway to focus on.

* PWagreed to discuss within ICL Pathway and bring the scorecard back to a future meeting for further discussion. See AP011106

° It was agreed that the scoring would be completed on a quarterly basis

8. ANY OTHER BUSINESS
To discuss any other issues

ent an e-mail to LT regarding the switch off at Husthwaite on 30/01/02. He asked what information was available to allow ICL Pathway to formally ‘size’
the impact of the switch off. A CR had been requested by ICLP, but it was agreed that one was not needed and this could be done via a formal letter from DG.
Consideration should be given in the longer term whether an operational change management process was needed. See AP #######

Network Reinvention

¢ PWstated that he was aware that there is a plan for network reinvention which is likely to increase the number of OBC changes substantially. For ICL Pathway to
meet the anticipated demand they will have to recruit and will require 2 months to train staff. The current Contract allows for up to a 10% change across the
network - a CR should be raised to increase this percentage figure if necessary. MB agreed to discuss the contractual implications with Keith Baines, DG to give
PW an informal briefing on Network Reinvention plans outside of the meeting. See AP011107

Network Banking
© PWhad received feedback from the project that some general SLA issues are to be raised by POL. DG and LT were unaware of any issues other than the
anticipated changes to Schedule G10 around time to fix SLA’s.

MBS.

¢ PW believes that there are still issues with the use of MBS and quoted an example of when ICL Pathway had wanted to use it for 100 offices regarding a Quantum
issue on 19/11/01 but it was denied because it was not in connection with a Problem. JW explained that he is trying to move the control of MBS to Problem
Management in the future to sort out some of these issues.

9. REVIEW OF MEETING

* It was agreed that meetings would be held every two months but with monthly dates left in diaries in case there is a need for a meeting. It was also agreed to
arrange the meeting dates earlier in the month. Proposed schedule attached.
