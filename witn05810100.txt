POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

First Witness Statement of John Legg

I, John Legg, will say as follows...

1. | was employed by The Post Office/ Post Office Counters Ltd (POCL)/ Post
Office PLC for over 34 years from February 1975 until October 2009 when |
retired at age 60. | started as a graduate entrant at PEC level and ended my
career as a Senior Manager at Band 8 level.

2. From 1975 to 1987 | worked in a variety of management roles in the mails
side of the business until the creation of POCL as a separate entity. At that
point | began working in North London Counters District until, as best as | can
recall, 1995, when the business reorganised again and | moved to POCL’s
HQ and began to work on the contracts for services between POCL and
Subpostmasters.

3. My HQ roles (variously named over the years) were all focussed on the
overarching status, at law, of the Subposimaster contracts, with particular
regard to National Insurance Contributions, VAT, Employment Protection
Legislation and Competition Law. The legal status of Subpostmasters in
these areas was complex, and of very considerable financial significance to
the business. Challenges at Employment Tribunal, and VAT Tribunal were not
uncommon and were all successfully defended. The proactive management
of National Insurance Contributions to ensure POCL did not pay more than it
was required to was also my responsibility. | was also, amongst others in HQ,

responsible for the provision of expert advice to other parts of the business,

as appropriate, to ensure that any new proposals, initiatives or policies did not
jeopardise the status quo in these critical areas.

4. My overarching contractual role did not involve any detailed knowledge of,
ownership of, deployment of, management of, or in any other way,
involvement in, any of the issues upon which | have been asked to give
evidence to this Inquiry save for any possible input | may have had to protect
the very nature of the contracts as described at para 3, above.

5. [can assure the Inquiry that I have scrutinised, in detail, all of the documents
referred to me. In particular, | have considered the following categories of
documents, which formed the basis of the Rule 9 request to which this
statement responds (which | list below for ease of reference):

so badly during this whole sorry saga, | can add no more.
