POST OFFICE LTD - CASE REVIEW

R-v- PETER HUXHAM
Exeter Crown Court
PRE-HORIZON ON-LINE CASE

Offence and Case History

1. On the 29" March 2010 at the Exeter Crown Court before HHJ Wassall,
this defendant was sentenced to 8 months imprisonment. The single
charge of Fraud by misrepresentation contrary to section 1 of the Fraud
Act 2006 alleged that between 1% October 2008 and the 29" September
2009 he made false representations in Final Trading Accounts for

Starcross Post Office amounting to £16,158.56.

2. The defendant was summonsed and appeared at Torquay Magistrates
Court on 3™ March 2010. He pleaded guilty and the magistrates
committed him for sentence to the Exeter Crown Court where he
appeared on the 29" March 2010. On that date the learned judge held a
‘mini-Newton’ hearing with the defendant giving evidence on oath. The
defendant had maintained throughout the case that he did not take the
money and knew nothing about where it went. The judge disbelieved the

defendant and sentenced him as in paragraph 1 above.

Prosecution case

3. On 29" September 2009 Post Office Network Auditors attended Starcross
Post Office to conduct a verification of assets on hand. At the
commencement of the audit the defendant told the lead auditor that the
accounts would be about £15,000 short. He said that it started at about
£2,000 two years ago and has risen each month and that he had been

covering up the loss each month, but that he had not taken any of the

money. He suggested that a member of staff might be responsible. The
audit was completed and a total deficiency of £16,158.56 was reported,
made up of

(1) £16,056.28 cash deficiency

(2) £102.28 stock deficiency

. The officer went with the defendant to his private accommodation and he
maintained he had not taken the money and that he had made an
appointment with the police to report the loss. He was upset and shaken
and referred to his wife divorcing him. However, he was fully co-

operative.

. The defendant was interviewed under caution on 22™ October and 25"

November 2009. He said as follows:

- He had worked since April 1994 at Starcross, from 0400 - 1800 hours,
with his wife also working in the post office.

- he never did the daily cash declarations but would accept the previous
day’s figures.

- The only time he would know of a deficiency was when he was
completing the monthly trading statement.

- small losses started occurring from about 18 months previously
which he would repay from his business (the newsagents attached to
Starcross which he also owned) but that the losses continued to
increase.

- He told his wife in October 2008.

- All trading statements from October 2008 would show false balances.

- His children would enter the Post Office from time to time and there
was also a part time worker but she did not have access.

- He continued to deny taking the money but admitted covering up the

shortfall.

6. The defendant’s wife was also interviewed and also denied taking the

money. She was concerned about the amount the defendant was spending

that he only told her about the accounting shortfall a couple of months

previously.

Defence case

7. The defendant pleaded guilty but at his committal for sentence hearing,
HHJ Wassall indicated that he would sentence the defendant on the basis
that he must have taken the money unless he established his basis that he
knew nothing about where the money went. There is some indication on
counsel’s back sheet endorsement that the defendant stated on oath that

his wife took the money. The judge found that he did not believe that.

8. The defendant paid back the £16,158.56 in full.

9. When the auditors arrived they found that the premises were in disarray
and there were a number of uncollected postal packets found at the office,

one dating back over 4 years.

Discussion
10. This is an unexplained loss case where the defendant states that he was
covering up losses that had occurred for reasons outwith his knowledge.
There is no danger of the defendant’s conviction being found to be unsafe
as he has admitted his guilt from the very first but he has been adamant
that he did not take the money to the point of fighting and losing a
“Newton hearing”. His explanations as to the possible loss relate to
possible thefts either by a member of staff or, seemingly, at the “Newton”
hearing, his wife may well have been modified into an attack on the

Horizon system had he but had the material to mount it.

11.1 doubt that an Appeal against Sentence will be mounted after any
disclosure that we might make in this case as the sentence has been long
served. The reality is that the Second Sight Interim Review deals in the
main with Horizon on Line, the system that superseded Mr Huxham’s
system but it did deal with pre Horizon on Line issues and in my view
had we had the material contained in the Second Sight Interim Report at

the time of the Newton Hearing we would have served it on the defence.

Conclusion

12. In my view had we had the material contained in the Second Sight Interim
Report at the time of the Newton Hearing we would have served it on the
defence. Those instructed by Mr. Huxham should be written to in order to
make disclosure of the material contained in the Second Sight Interim

Report.
