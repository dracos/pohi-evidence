Group Definitions for the Secure NT Build

Requirement Definition

The ACP requires that access to Pathway systems be
controlled by the use of pre defined roles to which users can
be assigned. Such roles will allow users to access only those
parts of the system, with associated objects, they need in order
to complete the tasks associated with that particular role. This
document summarises this requirement and defines the roles,
with associated objects, domains and access requirements.

1. Introduction

The nature of the Pathway system requires that access to the core systems should be
strictly controlled. [ACP] states that effective control depends on having a clear definition
of the roles and responsibilities of all personnel who need some form of access to the
system. Users will gain access by being assigned to these roles. This will be core to
Pathway implementing the principles of least privilege.

This document summarises the requirement and defines the human roles that will be
implemented for NT platforms; which objects will be used by each role; the domains each
role will function within; access point for the role; and associated privileges.

2. Scope

This document addresses the roles to be implemented as part of the Pathway central NT
systems and access rights assigned to each role. Each role within this document access
the datacentre through the Pathway NT Domain Structure referenced in [NT DOM]. With
regard to roles accessing systems in the Rollout Database domain, FRODB, all roles
described here will apply to all systems described in [NT DOM]. Roles described in this
document will not apply to the RODB Replication Server, which is not a member of the
FRODB domain.

Roles used by SMC, SMG and Girobank are specifically excluded from this document as
they authenticated on separate NT systems which form part of a managed service.

Roles used and defined by OSD are described in this document for completeness.
Configuration of these roles in the live estate may be partly provided by SDU and T&l PIT
or completely by OSD.

3. Requirements

The requirement to implement a role based access control system emanates from [ACP].
[ACP] further defines the roles that are required for access to the Pathway Systems and
the responsibilities of these roles.

It should be noted that the Pathway solution has moved on since Version 2 of the ACP
was issued and, as such, the Groups defined at Appendix A do not always correlate with
the roles defined in [ACP]. This will be addressed by feeding these role definitions into
the current review of the ACP which will be subject to a CP once all necessary changes
have been agreed.

4. Implementation
Each role will be set up as a Group within NT. Individual users will be assigned to these

Groups in which access to objects, domains, servers and associated privileges will be
controlled. These Groups are defined in Appendix A.

Roles will have defined access points which will have an accompanying Platform Design
Document. Access to objects will be made available to each role at the relevant access
point. This document specifically covers the Groups accessing the data centres. The
Horizon Helpdesk and SMC/SMG roles are the responsibility of the appropriate managed
service for the provision of suitable client systems compliant to the SFS and ACP.

The definition of the users will be held in a spreadsheet, or similar, and automated tools
will be used for the production of the relevant command scripts.

Human roles and service users, as defined in this document, will be implemented using
automated command scripts. By doing this, it will simplify the implementation and
maintenance of the roles and service users defined in Annex A and B. Exceptions to this
are those roles within the support services, ICL Outsourcing and SSC, who will also
access toolsets via the command line. All roles only have authority to access the toolsets
specified in this document.

Human users created from the defined roles may only be members of one role/Group
definition. This is required to ensure the user is only provided with one appropriate
toolset.

Implementation of the toolsets for the ICL Outsourcing roles will be the responsibility of
the managed service and profiles will be set up locally on the NT client. In these
instances there will be no user profile on the PDC.

Implementation of the menu structure for each Group will ensure that users assigned to
that Group will be able to access the application set necessary for them to fulfil their
duties. Not all tools will be available through a direct menu option; for example, Business
Objects Universes will be accessed via a Business Object menu option. The Business
Objects Administrator will be responsible for allocating the appropriate universes to users.
Those ‘tools’ prefixed with ‘>’ will not typically be assigned as a menu option through the
PDC.

4.1 NT Administrator User

The Windows NT operating system is provided with a super user known as the
‘Administrator’. This user has full administration and configuration privileges which is
exercised at both system/server and domain level. This capability cannot be removed
from Windows NT. Pathway recognises the power that this user has and the ability that a
human user, using the administrator user, has to interfere with the day to day operation of
the Pathway solution.

To address this issue, Pathway will limit and restrict the use of the NT Administrator User.

This will be achieved by:

> Renaming the Administrator User on all NT Servers so that it is hidden from the system.
The account name and password will be specified by the Pathway Security Manager,
which will be strictly controlled and stored in a secure safe.

> Restrict full administrator privileges to the ‘Operational Management’ role. Use of this
role will be subject to the management and procedural controls set out in the ‘Pathway
Code of Practice’, PA/STD/010.

5. Notes that apply to Annex A
Those ‘tools’ prefixed with ‘>’ will not be assigned as a menu option from the users
workstation/access point. Instead the tool will be made available to the user from the

Command Line.

The term NT Resource Kit will mean the full complement of NT Resource Kit utilities will
be made available to the user role.

The term NT Resource Kit* {Toolname} will mean only the specific Resource Kit utility or
utilities specified by {Toolname} will be made available to the user role.

The term NT Server Tools will mean the default Administrative Tools (Common)
executables delivered with the NT Operating System.
