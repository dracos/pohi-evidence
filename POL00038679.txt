meeting and welcomed all those present.

POLARC PROSECUTIONS POLICY
14/2
(a) The Committee received a report which outlined the proposed changes to
the prosecutions policy and the way in which Post Office would prosecute
criminal cases in the future. The GC explained that the recommended
policy would limit criminal prosecutions to cases of egregious misconduct
taking into account the factors laid out in the paper.

ACTION: I . . .

Company (b) The ARC discussed the three options as laid out in the paper and

Secretary supported the recommended option, asking for a review in a year’s time.

(c) Angela Van-Den-Bogerd explained her work on Business Improvement

and the effect this had on reducing cases coming to prosecution. The
ARC asked if this had increased the risk in the business, but it was
explained that earlier detection of possible problems along with a more
pragmatic approach to suspensions was having a positive effect.

ACTION: (d) Angela Van-Den-Bogerd clarified that this would not stop criminal

Angela VDB prosecutions through the civil courts. A detailed paper on Business
Improvement would be provided for the next Board meeting.
