Start time: Units:

I had a telephone conversation with Greg Booth who had just received my letter. He will
give me his dates to avoid nearer the time, but we should avoid Wednesdays.

He said that there had been an occurrence on Horizon yesterday. The system had frozen
and it had lost a transaction of £1.27 had not been settled. He was in the middle of a
transaction when this was taking place. It related to a postage label. There was no prompt
when he logged back in to say that the transaction needed to be recovered. I asked him
what the net effect was and he said that in actual fact as the transaction hadn’t been
recorded but the branch had taken the money, the branch would be £1.27 up, rather than
down. However he wanted to tell me about this because it did demonstrate at least that the
system could lose transactions.

I asked him whether he thought that the system could lose transactions totalling about
£26,000 and he said no. This was the only time in all his years working as a sub-postmaster
that he had known it to happen. However he thought he should draw it to my attention.
Thanking him for this.

Time engaged: 12 minutes.
