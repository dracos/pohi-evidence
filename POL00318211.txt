Subject: Meeting with the Experts on 29th July 2015 at 11 a.m.

Attachments: IC Consultants - Document received Kramer and Dulay - July 2015.pdf; Invoice 87020 - PO.pdf

Dear Rodric,
Thank you for your e-mail.

Ihave been attempting to set up a meeting with the experts for some time. Unfortunately this has
proved difficult due to their unavailability. Professor Kramer spent a significant part of June out of
the country and following his return, Dr. Dulay was unavailable. You will no doubt appreciate that
both experts have different specialisms and in those circumstances neither is prepared to attend a
meeting with POL in the absence of the other.

Both experts would have been available to attend a meeting with POL on 14*, 21st or 224 July and
those dates are, of course, the ones which I have referred to in my recent e-mails.

Ihave now ascertained that the experts could attend a meeting on 29 or 30% July. Although I have
fixed the meeting for 29'* July, I have asked that the 30'" be kept free for the moment in case that is
more convenient.

So far as an action plan and timeline is concerned, I would advise that this be drawn up at the
forthcoming meeting with the experts’ input for a number of reasons.

Firstly, the experts should be able to provide an update on the work which has previously been
carried out and details of the remaining work which they anticipate will be necessary, identifying any
further material which they would wish to see.

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it has been made clear to me that if the experts feel that
they are being asked to work to deadlines which may be unrealistic given that they may have other
project work to complete during the Summer, or which would prevent them from looking at all of the
material which they would wish to see or from conducting other relevant lines of investigation, there
is a risk that they may decline any further instructions from POL to avoid producing a report which
may not be up to their usual standard.

In order that a realistic timeline may be prepared at the meeting, it would be helpful to have a
representative of POL’s IT department present to discuss the setting up of the data vault , the
provision of any further material required from either POL or Fujitsu and the time it would take to
provide that.

Ihave been asked by Imperial College London to remind POL of their outstanding invoice, and I
have attached a copy for ease of reference. I have also attached the list of documents which the
experts have prepared.

Please let me know if 11 a.m. on 29' July is convenient and whether the meeting can take place at
POL.

Kind regards,

Martin.
