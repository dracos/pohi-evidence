INTRODUCTION

It is the duty of the Security Manager to contact the Lead Auditor
within 60 days of the audit if they require the original paperwork
from an audit.

It is imperative that the Lead Auditor completes and forwards the
Event Capture Form within 48 hours to the recipients as detailed on
the Audit Reporting Tool (ART) including the Security Team as this
gives them the initial starting point of the need for an investigation
that may lead to a court case and successful prosecution.

If you have not been contacted within 60 days of the audit you must
shred all paperwork relating to that audit.

After 60 days the only records from the audit available will be those
held electronically on SharePoint, or those previously requested by
the Security Manager

The ART electronic Microsoft Excel form, when completed, holds most of the
information that needs to be retained following an audit. They are stored on a
SharePoint and this has therefore considerably reduced the amount of
manual paperwork.

Original paperwork supporting an audit will from time to time be required for
a variety of purposes (e.g. presentation at court during legal proceedings),
and for this reason a policy of retaining such paperwork has been introduced.

This policy covers the retention of manual documentation arising from audit
activity; stating periods of retention, detailing storage arrangements,
retrieval instructions, and destruction.

All audit papers are to be retained by the lead auditor and held for a period of
60 days. This allows for any immediate post-audit queries to be raised and
answered without delay.

SECTION 1- STANDARDS FOR THE RETENTION OF AUDIT PAPERS

1.1. All ART’s (electronic Microsoft Excel forms) to be retained on SharePoint
for at least seven financial years following the year in which the audit was
undertaken. Electronic files to be deleted from laptops once confirmed on
network server.

1.2 All manual supporting documentation (detailed at 1.4) to be securely
retained by the lead auditor for a period of 60 days from the date of audit.

1.3. After 60 days, all manual supporting documentation will be shredded. If
you are unsure whether to shred documents you can discuss your
concerns with Security Team or your Area Audit Manager. It is the
Security Manager's duty to request audit papers within 60 days.

Events requiring investigation may include:

Suspension of Postmaster / Operator / Agent

Misuse of funds

Unexpected discrepancy greater than £1000

Admission of, or suspicion of, false accounting or theft

Irregular personal cheque on hand

Credit sales

Instances where unfamiliar circumstances are encountered. In these
cases a decision to destroy or retain should be made following
discussion with the Security Team.

1.4. The supporting documentation retained should contain the following
items:
¢ Security Request Summary Sheet if papers are requested (Knowledge
Centre - Audits - Chapter 02 Working Papers);
e Cash, currency and stock sheets where used;
¢ Compliance Audit Test (CAT) report (Print the email confirmation);
e Any reports generated from Horizon required by the audit process or
relating to the audit irregularity
e Any hand written notes, papers or associated evidence relating to an audit
that revealed an irregularity.

1.5 The documentation included in any Quality Assurance Review (QAR) must
be retained by the Area Audit Manager completing the QAR for a period of
7 years following the completion of the QAR. This will ensure evidence is
retained for possible use when completing the Personal Development
Review (PDR) or if QAR results are subsequently questioned. It also
allows documentation to be retained for external audit purposes, if
required.
