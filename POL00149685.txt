Indeed.

Teaching you to suck eggs but I laid the ground for the way out of this with honour preserved. Although there is a
fundamental difference of view on public / private law point, circumstances have also changed markedly. So focus on
the fact that at the time decisions were taken there was a fear there was a problem with Horizon. We now know

there is not. That puts us in a much stronger position to be robust in the face of provocation from 3” parties.

Coming up with a new version of history not just on this will be key to eg ensuring that nothing sticks on AP / PV when
blame is being apportioned.

Happy to chat after school run if helpful to talk anything through

F*ck - unfortunate that he bumped into Alice before Mark and I collared him. I fear now for RW a bit...
