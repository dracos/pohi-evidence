ACCEPTANCE REPORT FOR HNG-X ACCEPTANCE GATEWAY 4

oO
FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1. Introduction

This document comprises the HNG-X Acceptance Report to the HNG-X Acceptance Board for the
assessment of the progression through Acceptance Gateway 4 (AG4) — Readiness for Branch Migration
and as consequence to have achieved HNG-x Initial Acceptance.

The basis for HNG-X Acceptance is defined in Schedule B6.3 and some sections are reproduced within
this report.

The HNG-X Requirements and HNG-X Acceptance Criteria are contained in the HNG-X Requirements
Catalogue and represent POL DOORS archive v2.00

Those HNG-X Acceptance Criteria allocated (in the HNG-X Acceptance Plan) to the Live Pilot Stage
(ending at AG4) are contained in Appendix A.1.

Those HNG-X Acceptance Criteria allocated (in the HNG-X Acceptance Plan) to the preceding Test and
Validation Stage (ending at AG3), including those allocated to achieving progression through Acceptance
Gateways AG1 & AG2, are contained in Appendix A.2.

The definition of the HNG-X Acceptance Methods is contained in Appendix B.
The definition of the Acceptance Incident Severity is contained in Appendix C.

1.1. Scope
The purpose of this Acceptance Board is: -

‘To agree the Acceptance status of the relevant Release (HNG-X Release 1 for AG4) and provide a
recommendation to the ‘Joint Release Authorisation Board’.' The proposed options that this Board can
select from are described in Appendix D.

This recommendation is based on an assessment of the status of the applicable POL Requirements and
Acceptance Criteria and of the stage progression criteria for AG4 as described in Schedule B6.3.

The primary assessment concerns the status of all Acceptance Incidents, the workarounds required and
all applicable HNG-X Rectification Plans or target rectification timescales as follows:-

Progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 4 shall occur once all of the following have
been satisfied for the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria allocated to achieving progression through the
respective HNG-X Acceptance Gateway:

(a) subject to paragraph 4.6 (of Schedule B6.3 which refers to dispute handling, defect
aggregation and deferred tests), all such HNG-X Acceptance Criteria have been achieved;

(b) there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance Incidents;

(c) the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents is five or fewer
and:-

i. an agreed workaround exists for each of them

ii. an agreed HNG-X Rectification Plan exists for each of them unless, exceptionally, the
parties agree that this is not required

(d) there is an agreed workaround for all outstanding HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance
Incidents except for those which the Parties agree do not require a workaround, and:-

oO ACCEPTANCE REPORT FOR HNG-X ACCEPTANCE GATEWAY 4
FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

i. there exists a target timescale for rectification except where the parties agree that this
is not required

(e) details of all Non Incidents are recorded, although they shall have no impact upon
Acceptance Gateway progression

Progression through AG4 is also dependant upon the achievement of those HNG-X Acceptance Criteria
that were allocated (in the HNG-X Acceptance Plan) to the preceding Test and Validation Stage (ending
at AG3) and:-

(a) were found to be defective and were agreed to be Deferred Fix Status on the understanding that a fix
would be effected during the Live Pilot Stage or

(b) it was impossible for a test to be carried out when scheduled in the HNG-X Acceptance Plan and that
test was agreed to be a "Deferred Test" on the understanding that the test would be carried out during
the Live Pilot Stage.

These together with other supporting factors are summarised in the following checklists for AG4.

It should be noted that there are also defects that are not linked to POL Requirements and which are not
the subject of Acceptance Incidents. A separate assessment of the status and significance of these has
been undertaken and this will be available for consideration at the Release Authorisation Board.

1.2 HNG-X Rectification Plans

All Acceptance Incidents will have an agreed workaround except those for which the Parties agree such a
workaround is not required.

Each Low Severity Acceptance Incident will have a target timescale for rectification except those for
which the Parties agree such a target timescale is not required.

Each Medium Severity Acceptance Incident will have an HNG-X Rectification Plan except where the
Parties agree that a rectification plan is not required. Each rectification plan will include:-

(a) A statement of the operational impact and any necessary temporary procedures to be
adopted by the users

(b) A description of how the rectification is to be achieved; and

(c) A timetable for the rectification

The rectification plans for each of the Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents are contained in section
41

1.4 Acceptance Decision

The AG4 Acceptance Board was held on 29/06/10 and approval to proceed through AG4 was granted.

The Board agreed that:

“Approval is given to proceed through AG4. This approval is given without prejudice to any claims for loss
or damages arising out of the delays to the date of planned completion of end May 2010 up to the date
hereof and in respect of any additional delay arising out of the default of Fujitsu”

This decision was discussed at the corresponding Release Authorisation Board and recorded in the

minutes of these meetings.

2 Review of status of Acceptance Criteria

This section shows the status of the POL requirements for Acceptance Gateway 4 (all of which are Non-
Functional requirements) together with the overall position for all Acceptance Criteria to date — i.e. from
Acceptance Gateways 1,2,3 and 4. Details for the previous Acceptance Gateways can be found in the
relevant report.

2.1 Criteria for assessment at Acceptance Gateway 4

The non functional Acceptance Criteria associated with Acceptance Gateway 4 and their status is as
follows: -

Document Review 1 1
Design Walkthrough 1 1
Monitoring 1 5 6
Statement of Fact 12 12
Solution Test 1 18 19
Release Validation 1 2 3
Test

Grand Total 2 ie) 4 39 42

Note: It has been agreed that the 7 AG4 Security Monitoring criteria are re-assigned to AG6. This is due
to the limited assessment time available in Pilot. These criteria together with the existing AG6 Security
Monitoring criteria will be subject to joint review as part of the Information Security Management Forum.

In addition MIG-3100 (MO) concerning the completion of the provision of system performance statistics
has been agreed to be moved toAG6.

Key to Status

Delayed / Deferred Test - This identifies the number of criteria that are subject to ‘deferred test’ status.
See section 2.3.

Failed (Deferred Fix) — Each Failed Criteria that is subject to a deferred fix is shown in section 2.4.
Applicable defects are represented by an Acceptance Incident in section 3

Failed (No POL impact) - This status indicates that a criterion has one or more defects associated with it
that has not yet been resolved, but the defect does not have any POL Business Impact and does not
result in an Al. These defects are described in section 2.4.4.1.

2.3 Delayed (Deferred) Test status

The Schedule B6.3 acknowledges that there may be circumstances when previously scheduled testing
that was targeted for completion by this Acceptance Gateway cannot now take place. Providing that this
is not due to a contractual default by Fujitsu, and the parties agree, then the tests associated with a POL
requirement may be delayed — this is known in the contract as a ‘Deferred Test’. Fujitsu are still obliged
to carry out these ‘Deferred Tests’.

For this Acceptance Gateway, Either Fujitsu or Joint Test Team has requested that tests associated with
the following requirements are given this ‘Deferred Test’ status. Quality Centre does not record this
status and so the current QC status is shown for each criterion.

2.3.1 Delayed Test Status — remaining from AG3

2.3.1.1

The following HNG-X Acceptance Criteria were identified as having delayed test status at AG3 but it was
not expected that the test would be carried out during the Live Pilot Stage: They retain this status at
AG4.

The Acceptance Incidents listed below have been raised because the acceptance evidence has failed to
demonstrate that the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria have been achieved. They have been classified into
four groups: -

e Those arising from testable HNG-X Acceptance Criteria with defects whose resolution
has been agreed to be deferred until after Initial Acceptance. These have an identifier of
AI-AD-nnn

e Those arising from non-testable HNG-X Acceptance Criteria with defects whose
resolution has been agreed to be deferred until after Initial Acceptance. These have an
identifier of AI-NT-nnn.

e Those arising from HNG-X Acceptance Criteria with defects where no formal deferral
discussions have taken place. All AG4 Acceptance incidents are in this group. These
have an identifier of Al-TS-nnn.

e Those raised by POL in accordance with the provisions described at paragraphs 6.1.2 of
contract schedule B6.3.

3.2.3. Al change of severity
The following Als have changed their severity since AG3:-

a) AI-TS-019 (Defect 12828 / Peak PC0191931) — This defect concerns firewall settings and has
been discussed and risk assessed in the joint security forum.

This was a Low severity and is now changed to Medium —see section 4.1.

Reason — firewall rule changes to prevent any-any connections on particular firewalls have not
yet been applied.

In addition:-

e AI-NT-1001 — Risk Management was raised to a High severity in the period between AG3 and
AG4 but has now been resolved and all associated defects / Als have either been closed or will
be progressed on an individual basis. These comprise three migration criteria (see section 2.4.2)
where acceptance evidence has been submitted to POL.

e AI-TS-1001 - Patch Management was raised to a High severity in the period between AG3 and
AG4 but has now been reduced to a Medium severity — see section 4.1. This is subject to
regular review via the joint security forum.

3.4 Acceptance Incident Aggregation

Schedule B6.3 (4.6.3) recognises that HNG-X Acceptance Incidents that are agreed to result from the
same failure or deficiency, or to affect the same operational process or business function and will be
addressed by one fix or a combination of fixes, may be aggregated into a single HNG-X Acceptance
Incident for the purposes of the thresholds identified in section 1.2. The following sections contain details
of all of the individual Acceptance Incidents and then identifies where aggregation has occurred.

3.4.1 Aggregated Als from Agreed Deferrals

At AG3 there were 44 individual Als that were aggregated into 12 Low Severity Als. At AG4 various Als
have been closed and the net figure is now 32 individual Als that are aggregated into 10 Low severity
Als.

3.4.2 Aggregated Als from non-testable criteria

At AG3 there were 10 individual Als that were aggregated into 1 Medium Severity Al (Risk Management).
At AG4 one Al has been split away to facilitate separate management and the remaining 9 individual Als
have now been closed, removing the aggregated Medium severity Al.

3.4.3 Aggregated Als from testable criteria

At AG4 there are two individual Als — Al-TS-040 / defect 13141 and Al-TS-041 / defect 13148 concerning
Patch Management that have been aggregated into a single Medium Al (Al-TS-1001).

4 HNG-X Rectification Plans & Target timescales

The rectification planned for the Medium severity Als are described below.
4.1 Rectification Plans for Medium Severity Als

4.1.1 Al-TS-1001 - Patch and Vulnerability Management

Al Summary

These defects arose from findings in the Portcullis report and identify that the patch status (including anti-
virus) of HNG-X platforms is not up to date.

These are defects 13141 / Peak PC0194037 and 13147 / PC0194043. The affected requirement is SEC-
3212.

Operational Impact

The Portcullis review identified that the patch state of HNG-X was not up to date and that there was no
process in place to rectify this situation. As a consequence there was a greater risk exposure due to out
of date patches and virus signatures. Urgent attention and commitment from senior FS management is
required to re-establish patch and virus management as a matter of priority.

Workaround

An initial remedial plan was established and has been implemented. This focussed on deploying IDS and
AV signature updates and on identifying critical patches on PCI and Tier 1 platforms. These have been
deployed.

Approach to rectification

A plan to review the current process and then to identify and manage the application of necessary
patches, virus engines and signatures has been agreed and shared with POL. Key deliverables include
an updated process document, the identification of necessary patches etc by platform and the
establishment of a Patch Management Board to oversee the on-going process. A firm commitment from
FS senior management has also been provided.

The plan deliverables and progress have been discussed with POL, together with details of recently
deployed patches and AV signatures. POL now attends the Patch Management Board.

Timetable for Rectification

The Patch Management process and AV process are progressing towards a business as usual operation.
The target deployment times have been shared with POL and will operate to a regular cycle,
supplemented by an emergency process as needed.

4.1.2 Al-TS-019 - Arising from Portcullis Pen Test report

Al Summary

This defect relates to an issue raised in the Portcullis Pen test report referenced in paras 9.2, 9.3,9.4 &
9.8. This defect concerns firewall settings and has been assessed for severity and impact by the joint
security forum who will oversee the resolution of this issue.

This is defect 12828 / Peak PC0191931

Operational Impact

This defect arises from the Portcullis Penetration Report and concerns the need to update various firewall
configurations to remove the ‘any-to-any' rule settings on specific firewalls. In particular the settings on
the Branch to Data Centre firewalls have to be revised.

Other security controls are in place to mitigate the risk but it is recognised that these config changes are
required.

This issue is being managed and monitored via the joint security forum.
Workaround

No workaround is required since the rectification plan covers all the required actions.

Approach to rectification

Configuration changes have already been applied to various firewalls and actions are in place to
complete the task. There is no release dependency on this task, although scheduling the update will take
account of the current operational status of HNG-X

Timetable for Rectification

This is expected to be resolved by end of July 2010.

4.1.3 Al-TS-058 - Obtain Daily Cash on Hand

Al Summary

This defect relates to a Business Equivalence exception concerning the timing of when the Overnight
Cash Holdings (ONCH) declaration is done by a branch.

This is defect 13922 / Peak PC0200577

Operational Impact

Under Horizon a Branch can carry out the ONCH cash declaration at any time of the day and with no
restrictions on any subsequent trading. The latest cash declaration in a Branch is sent to SAPADS each
night to support Cash replenishment.

This defect identifies that HNG-X will not send the ONCH to SAPADS if any transactions have been
performed on the stock unit after the cash declaration has been made. In practice this means branches
have to carry out this declaration as the last transaction on each stock unit. This is operationally
inconvenient as is contrary to the way in which Horizon operates. Branches who are unaware of this
restriction will now not received accurate cash replenishments.

Workaround

The workaround requires Branches to carry out the ONCH as the last transaction of the day on each
stock unit.

Approach to rectification
Code changes will be applied to the BRDB to remove the limitations described above.
Timetable for Rectification

This is scheduled for resolution in July 2010.

4.2 Rectification Target timescales for Low Severity Als

Post Office and Fujitsu have assessed all of the Low Severity Als arising from AG3 and newly introduced
at AG4. Agreements have been reached on the target timescale for rectification and this is expressed
either in the form a time period or as target release. In some cases a target rectification time is not
required, either because the defect is now closed, is for progression by POL or it is agreed that no
rectification is required.

The target timescales are:-

1. Specific time period — mainly associated with non-functional defects (typically establishment of
processes or document provision)

Security Forum — rectification tasks and timescales are agreed via the joint security forum
Functional Release 2 — target timescale is August 2010
Release 2 Maintenance or Release 3 — target timescale is October / November 2010

aR ON

Future — this is used for any defects that are agreed as requiring rectification after the releases
named above. The rectification status and target timescale will be reviewed again at AG6.

Indicative timescales for these releases are shown above however these are subject to change and will
be formally agreed via the joint programme reviews (for the Functional releases) and via the Release
Management Form (for the maintenance releases).

The total number of individual Low Severity Als associated with these Target Releases / timescales is
summarised below and detailed in the embedded document below.

Target Release / Timescales Totals
Specific time period 18
Security Forum 2
Functional Release 2 27
Release 2 Maintenance / Release 3 96
(See Note)
Future 9
POL to Action 3
Rectification timescales not required 77 (Includes 10 Als raised and closed before AG3)
(Defects / Als closed)

Total I 232

Note:

This set of defects has been assessed by POL as having a low business impact and accordingly they
have been prioritised to these later releases. POL and FS will jointly review this set to establish a more
precise prioritisation and target rectification timescale, taking into account operational experience and the
priorities of other changes that are occurring in these releases.

C Definition of Acceptance Incident Severity

The definition of the severity of an HNG-X Acceptance Incident is defined in Appendix A of Schedule
B6.3 HNG-X Acceptance Process and reproduced below.

High The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that would render a key element of
one or more of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or a key element of the
Infrastructure unfit for operational use, which could include:

a) not allowing Post Office to undertake one or more Transaction types;

b) not allowing Post Office to undertake one or more Transaction types using the
required business inputs or generating the required business outcome;

c) creating system performance issues which are in, or are likely to cause a, breach
of Service Level Targets.

Medium The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that would not prevent operation of
one or more of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or elements of the
Infrastructure, but would cause problems in the operational use of one or more
Transaction types.

Low The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that does not cause any adverse
operational impact in the use of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or an
element of the Infrastructure, or the HNG-X Acceptance Incident can be addressed by
a workaround without any adverse operational impact for Post Office.
