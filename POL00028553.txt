Roll-out Decision - Demand Position Paper

In anticipation of the criteria due to be met by 24" November not having been met by that date, and
given POCL’s associated concems, POCL is proposing that the existing monitoring activities should
continue and be strengthened, and is also proposing the introduction of some new activities. POCL
proposes the following.

1.

AI 298 - System Stability

Objective:

© to ensure that Pathway continue to reduce the level of instability.

© the current recording at the HSH does not facilitate the analysis and identification of faults
and trends. POCL believe the best way of doing this is for Pathway, at their own expense,
to develop a codified and structured fault recording system that will allow analysis to
support the combined problem management and resolution function

the current monitoring should continue for a further four weeks. The target for this period
should be the same as the current period.

AI376 - Data Integrity

¢ to ensure that the integrity control is capable of detecting all relevant incidents
© tocontinue to monitor error levels so POCL has an appropriate view of the level of
disruption and cause of new incidents
© to increase POCL’s level of understanding of the design and operation of emerging
reconciliation controls:
a) to be ina position for POCL to design complementary operational procedures
b) obtain confidence that the new controls will be effective - given the constrained
level of testing, POCL require greater level of assurance before release into the
live environment. This is necessary in order for POCL to be assured that criteria
376 iii and iv are being met

© The EPOSS/TIP reconciliation feature must be proven to be capable of detecting all data
errors that would be detected by the TIP cash account compare process; for the avoidance
of doubt, this includes an explicit check that receipts are equal to payments. This to be
achieved by :
¢ logical assurance of authorised design documentation
© analysis of all previous root causes to determine that errors would be detected
© testing to a jointly agreed strategy and high level test plan
© dual running of EPOSS/TIP reconciliation and TIP Cash Account processes on
test and live environments, over the periods described in CCN560, and subject to
known stress conditions including outlet migration, reference data changes,
transaction level data corruption
© the current monitoring should continue as defined in the second supplemental agreement
for criteria 376 i-iii with the monitoring period commencing on the 18" November
© Pathway should demonstrate that they have met criterion 376 iv, if necessary by enhancing
their Integrity Control design. This should include faults identified before September 24"
and any faults found in the current monitoring period which would not have been detected
by the current integrity control design
« Pathway should co-operate with POCL to review and revise the Rectification Plan to
include new activities necessary for the successful development and implementation of
operational procedures and any other new activities shown to be necessary by the review
¢ Pathway to extend the Logical Design information that is contractually controlled to cover
those areas that POCL’s experts reasonably say need to be subject to POCL’s agreement,
mainly interface and operational procedures

3.

4.

POL00028553
POL00028553

© mindful of the short time scales and the desire not to impede progress, the POCL ATM to
be integrated into Pathway’s delivery team so that POCL can gain the appropriate level of
visibility in the design and progress to give POCL confidence in the Release
¢ Pathway’s progress in developing the integrity release to be included in the scope of the
review of readiness for roll-out which has been agreed and will be carried out by PA
Consulting
TIP checking shall continue at Pathway’s expense until both of the following have
occurred:
— four weeks parallel running without faults as in the current contract
— Pathway to have modified their integrity control to detect all error types that have
occurred by that date.

Al 408 - HSH Performance

Objectives:
© to give POCL confidence that HSH can support roll-out especially:
a) to ensure that the HSH is appropriately resourced for the peak periods within a
week
b) to ensure conformance to scripts.

© continue to monitor HSH criteria i, iii and iv for a further four weeks. The six week
monitoring period to be 1* November to 12" December. As per the original criteria, the
aim being to attain the target levels in four out of the six weeks. In addition, 408 ii and v
criteria should be enhanced (sce below)
© to facilitate a detailed analysis of the root cause of the problems and allow POCL to have a
more transparent understanding of ICL Pathway’s performance, criterion 408 ii (calls
answered within 20 seconds) should be reported during the four week extended period on
a daily basis. The target of 80% of all calls answered within 20 seconds should be met
every Wednesday and Thursday for three out of the four weeks and achieved as a weekly
average for the same three out of the four weeks.
© to permit POCL to perform an audit of actual physical resource to the planned resource
levels, Pathway to supply the four week detailed resourcing model broken down into 30
minute slots. POCL should be permitted to undertake an audit of physical resource to this
model at any time during the 4 weck period without prior notice. The actual resource
levels should be within 95% of the planned levels for every audit performed
© paragraph 4,3.2.9 of schedule G10 (as amended by Schedule 5 of CCNS560) to be further
amended so that the compliance with the scripts shall be measured using call recordings
which have been in operation since 1* November. A joint Pathway and POCL team to
review and agree whether the operator has conformed to the scripts. The call logs
detailing the scripts that have been used by the operator can be used as supporting
evidence for the call recordings and can form part of the review to determine compliance.
Pathway must achieve the target for the final three weeks of the audit. For this method of
monitoring compliance to be effective:
a) Pathway to satisfy POCL that Pathway auditors have the expertise to undertake
the review
b) POCL to select the calls at random
¢) all cash account calls to be recorded.
Note that this also has the effect of changing the method of measuring criterion 408v
© Pathway to continue to work with POCL to review the quality of script to improve the
accuracy leading to timely resolution of incidents. Additionally this will allow Pathway to
acquire business knowledge from POCL.

Activities:

unintended effects,

« A robust management process is defined, agreed and brought under contract control to

Status of Monitoring Report

1.

AI 298
There are on-going discussions with Pathway to finalise and agree the data.

AI376
1376 - Giro reference data integrity problem (Graeme Scedall - DN awaiting draft)

AI376/1. It should be noted that Pathway have re-classified the Root causes using their own
taxonomy. These and the associated figures have been added to POCL’s detailed AI376
monitoring report (sce attached), Pathway may argue that only their category 4 (Cash
Account Discrepancy (not reference data)) should be used in the monitoring statistics and
therefore they have met the criterion.

1376/3. Pathway’s view is that there are only 4 new causes of cash account discrepancies
which have not been analysed and a rectification plan submitted in 10 days. We don’t accept
this view, and even if we did it would be a fail.

1376/4, Pathway’s view is that there are no Cash Account discrepancies which would not
have been identified by the Accounting Integrity Control Release. This is presumably be
because they consider “Reversal of stock adjustment settlement”, “negative giro records”, and
“Ecco transfer problem” as out of scope of this AI. Pathway will not provide any design
documentation to confirm their analysis.

AI 376/5. Cycles 2 and 3 of System Testing will commence on 23 November. This
represents a slippage of eight calendar days against the original plan.

AI 408
1408/2. Pathway (John Dicks) are reporting this as passed as they are using 81% not 72%

for the week beginning the 1* November. They are excluding calls duc to reference data
problems for this week. POCL do not agree with this exclusion.

Roll-out 2000 Background version 0.1

AI 408/3 and 4. POCL are disputing the figures provided by Pathway which are generally no
ting backs or repeat calls. POCL and Pathway are meeting Monday 22™ pm to try and resolve
the difference of opinion (DN Adele Henderson should be providing on Friday POCL’s view
of the figures going into the meeting).

AI 408/5. Pathway are disputing POCL’s audit approach which has been used. POCL agree.
This criterion is therefore void.

A1408 - issues with Reference Data (Dave McLauglin - DN analysis provided, but not sure
what it’s saying - probably delete this point)
