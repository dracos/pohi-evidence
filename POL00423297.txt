The Chair declared the committee quorate and opened the meeting.

Action 1660 was agreed to be closed, the remainder of the actions were covered by the agenda
item discussions or were brought forward to the 22 June meeting. For action 1657 (POMS
reporting), it was agreed that the reporting process should be that papers discussed initially at
POMS RCC would subsequently be tabled at POMS ARC and would then report into POL ARC.
However, the format was still to be agreed and the action would be carried forward to the next
meeting.

The committee aaah the minutes of the rah eet and the attached actions.

SM outlined the principles in the paper and explained that bringing them to life did not require the
construction of elaborate systems. Instead what was key was executive sponsorship and building
capability in the 1* line. A series of actions for the 1° line to own with support from the second line
risk team was outlined.

SM added that there would not be a ‘one size fits’ all approach, more important was understanding
and engagement from the different areas of Post Office. For example, it was understood that in the
1% line the level of understanding of risk ownership would be less in some parts of the Post Office
than others, so greater support would be need to be dedicated to those areas.

SM confirmed that training was to be provided to the first line on the three lines of defence model
and what was required within ‘first line’ risk; initially focussing this training on all the designated
risk champions. It was agreed that FS could be used as an example of best practice to help
facilitate learning. The committee agreed the Principles paper would be submitted to the GE. It was
also decided that an overview of the three lines of defence and responsibilities should form part of
the leadership agenda at the next SLT away day. (Action 1658)

SM presented a high level gap analysis of Post Office’s compliance on the requirements of the UK

Corporate Governance Code. There were a number of gaps to fill, but we had to decide as a

business where we wanted to be on the maturity curve and the cost versus compliance costs of

actions taken. It was suggested, by the Committee, that if the appendix was simplified to all the

items Post Office would need to ‘explain’ (under the comply or explain aspects of the code) then

this would be a good way of focussing attention on the gaps and what compliance aspects we
should dedicate resource to as a priority. It was agreed that a simplified version of the gap analysis
would be produced together with a status report and what was planned to be achieved in the next
financial year. (Action 1663)

The Committee discussed these and some amendments were proposed, mainly for the Principal
Risk ‘underperformance in income’. It was agreed that this was one of the biggest risks facing the
Post Office; but the title of the risk should be amended to better reflect the ‘profitability’ aspects of
underperformance. It was decided that in the response to this risk we should capture that expense
reduction is also a key required response if Post Office is not hitting its profit targets. It was also
agreed to get further feedback from Commercial Committee on making the responses less tactical
and more strategic. The high rating of the people and capability risk should be checked prior to it
going to the ARC as well as amending the detail around ownership of the sales capability risk and
the wording around the FS risks.(Action 1659)

The Committee also suggested that the future calibration of the heat map could be considered to
ensure that the highest risks are shown in proportion to the other risks and to show trends (risk
increasing or decreasing).

For the presentation in the Annual Report and Accounts it was agreed that industrial action should
be given greater prominence than it was currently as this remained a key risk. On pension risk, it
was highlighted that if we were publicly to outline this risk to the DB scheme, then we would need
to be aware that in considering any further potential actions we should ensure that impacted staff
were made aware of these risks as well.

Operational and legal risks should add ‘telephony’ to regulatory risk and we should bring out
stronger the high regulatory risks for the FS business. Cost management and efficiency measures
as responses to underperformance should also be brought out in the response column.

It was agreed to incorporate the committee’s feedback in updating the risks for ARC. (Action
1664)

The risks inherent in ‘self-reporting’ were discussed. But it was confirmed by SM that this was
common industry practice. The proposed approach was that the risk team would work with 1° line
risk champions on facilitating reporting of ‘key incidents’ and thresholds for reporting would be
agreed. The paper was approved.

Martin George described a number of good practices that were found in the Post Office. However,
there was a need for a consistency of approach and an agreed Post Office wide definition of what
constituted a vulnerable customer. As part of this process he was reviewing current best practices
at Post Office as well as that of external firms and partner organisations. He agreed to report
progress at the next meeting (Action 1649)

Steve Miller explained that good discipline for future policy approvals would be that each policy for
approval/re-approval should be accompanied by a short note outlining the key changes together
with a track changed version of the policy. The Committee stressed that policies that impacted on
best outcomes for our customers should be prioritised.

Garry Hooton updated the Committee, the Internal Audit plan in the papers had been approved by

the ARC and were for noting. The committee requested that when audit reviews were presented to
the ARC that the business owner responsible for implementing agreed actions should be present
when the Internal Audit was presented.

It was agreed that GH would brief Alisdair Cameron on the travel expenses issues outlined in the
papers (Action 1665). Garry Hooton confirmed that the Conduct Risk (FS) Audit would be
presented to the June meeting (Action 1666)

The report was noted. The Committee asked that as well as refreshing awareness of the
requirements, the risk team should work with the Commercial team to ensure that their reporting
process was working properly bearing in mind the very low returns reported (Action 1667)

ID cards Policy and the (4) Information Security Policies were noted.
