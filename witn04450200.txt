   Please provide a full account of your involvement in and recollection of the

   criminal prosecution of Grant Allen. To assist you in providing this account,

   please consider the documents referred to below. Your account should

   address but is not limited to the questions set out below.



2. This enquiry was assigned to myself and Mr Allen was interviewed in
                                                                                         I
   accordance with PACE on 12 April 2012. He declined to have a solicitor or a

   Post Office friend present during the interview (forms POL001 — Legal rights

   and POL003 — POL employees' rights to a friend at interview were signed by

   him).



3. During the interview he stated he was unsure if he needed a solicitor and the

   interview was suspended. He then changed his mind and wished to continue

   without a solicitor (Form POL002 — Agreement to continue without Legal

   Advice was signed by him), before the interview recommenced authority was

   obtained from David Pardoe Senior Security Manager. At the end of interview

   Mr Allen was given a form (POL019 — notice to person whose interview has

   been audio recorded), Forms NPA001 (Notification of Proceedings to Police)

   and POL033 (Antecedents) were completed.

7. This enquiry for Winsford Post Office branch was allocated to me on or about

   the 7 February 2012.                          1




   Who authorised the prosecution of Grant Allen?



8. The advice to prosecute would have been given by the CLT / Cartwright King.

   David Pardoe Senior Security Manager wad on behalf of POL, the Designated

   Prosecution Authority Manager. The Designated Prosecution Authority

   Manager would have sight of the file and give authority to proceed on the

   advice given by CLT / Cartwright King.        i



   What evidence was obtained and relied upon by the Post Office in these

   proceedings and what was it obtained to address?



9. At interview Mr Allen was shown the Record of the Conversation he had with

   the auditors, the cash declaration, Branch Trading Statements, cash

   declaration, auditors report. In addition to the above the tape transcripts would

   have also been provided but the matter did not proceed to trial as Mr Allen

   entered a plea at the PC&MH.



   Was any Horizon data (and in particularARQ logs) requested from Fujitsu in

   this case?

10.
 0 1 do not recall any ARQ data being requested. Horizon data would be Cash

   declarations — Balance snapshots and Branch Trading Statements. If ARQ

   data was required the investigating Officer would submit a request to the

   Casework team who would subsequently request the data from Fujitsu.



   Who was the disclosure officer in this case?



11.Any disclosure would be in the first instance by me as the Investigation Officer

   at interview, in this case no solicitor was present as Mr Allen declined legal

   representation. If the matter proceeded to court then the following documents

   would be completed for any committal: Self disclosure of Investigators

   disciplinary record; Non sensitive unused material; Sensitive unused material;

   Disclosure officers report (material that mays undermine the prosecution case

   or assist the defence); Witness list including availability and contact details

   and the Exhibits list . After the matter had been listed for court any further

   evidence would be sent to the lawyers (CLT I Cartwright Wright King) with a

   statement who would then serve the evidence to the defence.



   Who was the investigation manager in this case?



12. The enquiry was assigned to me and Mr Andrew Wise was the 2nd Officer.



   Please explain your role in relation, to disclosure in these proceedings.

   material to the defence.



   Who was prosecution counsel in this case? (Please provide details of your role

   in instructing counsel.



14. Prosecution counsel was Mr John Gibson. '1r Gibson would have been

   instructed by Cartwright King. I did not spec`fically ask for any particular

  17. The Investigation of Grant Allen was conducted in a professional manner at all

      times. If any issues regarding bugs were declared by POL during this

      investigation, then any issues would have been looked at in depth to ascertain

      if there was any impact on this enquiry.



   18. I believe that the facts contained in this witrn'ass statement are true.
