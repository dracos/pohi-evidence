please consider the documents referred to below. Your account should

. This enquiry was assigned to myself and Mr Allen was interviewed in
accordance with PACE on 12 April 2012. He declined to have a solicitor or a
Post Office friend present during the interview (forms POLO01 — Legal rights
and POL003 — POL employees’ rights to a friend at interview were signed by

him). !

. During the interview he stated he was unsure if he needed a solicitor and the
interview was suspended. He then changed his mind and wished to continue

without a solicitor (Form POL002 — Agreement to continue without Legal

Advice was signed by him), before the interview recommenced authority was
obtained from David Pardoe Senior Security Manager. At the end of interview
Mr Allen was given a form (POL019 — notice to person whose interview has

been audio recorded), Forms NPAO01 (Notification of Proceedings to Police)

and POL033 (Antecedents) were completed.
