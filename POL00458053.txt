Henry,

This is a decision which requires a proper board discussion and the agreement of the shareholder,
neither of which have occurred. I also note that the SID position has already been externally
advertised and indeed there is a Sky news story reporting that I am stepping down. So the external
recruitment process is live and in the public domain.

Following the decision to appoint an internal candidate the vote was to appoint Andrew as our SID .
Congratulations to Andrew . Of course this requires an approval by the NomsCo and Board and then UKGI and
others .

Rachel will put the headhunters on hold on Monday . Lorna will inform UKGI of our decision to change course
and I will inform the Chair and CEO of UKGI when I meet them on Tuesday . There are other procedures to go
through with DBT .

Even in the last days or so there has been plenty happening particularly from organisations representing Post
Masters . Our "Post Master centric " strategy already looks as if it may need to be adapted . I will ask Rachel to
copy you with the relevant letters from Post Master organisations .

There will be plenty to discuss at our private meeting with just Nick and the NEDs . This will need to be before
the Board and Nick has kindly adapted the Agenda to allow us time for a 90 minute meeting if we need the time
. We need to try and get on the front foot in due course so all your thoughts would be helpful .

Have a good weekend .
Henry
