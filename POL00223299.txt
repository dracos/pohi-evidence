Who owns the IPR for HORIce (carried forward from 8 Jan 2015 with revised completion date)
‘confirmation required but update:-

HORice is a Fujtsu developed system to which we have just access therefore Fujitsu will own the
IPR

120150108.2

201502041

‘Speak to Paul Inwood to understand basis of charge back paper he is pulling together for Nick

Update: Paul Inwood has a draft paper “Improving network conformance by chargeable field
interventions” that sets out some of the non-compliance issues that result in service credits /

charges being passed back to POL by the upstream client e.g. Camelot, and possibly RM / others in

the future. The paper proposes: “to issue a pan-estate contract variation that would enable POL to

levy charge, proportionate to its costs only, for instances where it has supported a PM bymeans Angela
ofa field intervention, for training or other management intervention” as there is a risk that any

pass-back to a PM of a liquidated damage in a client contract is unlawful. Craig has looked into this

further and concluded that there is currently insufficient detail within the contracts with suppliers

for POLtd to prove the charges are a true estimate of cost of failure, this would leave POLtd unable

to prove the legality of the charge should this be challenged by an agent or their representatives.

Actions from previous meeting(s) #3

Proposed baton passing approach and in particular these batons forming objectives for 15/16
endorsed by group but Kevin challenged whether BAU behaviours are sufficiently robust at this stage
to support oris there a requirement to have a small BSP type team to ensure the focus is maintained fy
EXE YES and continuous improvement is embedded into BAU. Formal benefit tracker needs to continue after Angela ase
end of programme. Noted that business transformation could be an option in monitoring after end of
March? Discuss offline with group members and present at next meeting.
Update: proposal to be discussed at BSP Steering Group 4” March.

Investigate EMC on-boarding quote on behalf of BSP (information already supplied by Peter Prior-
Mills) Dave challenged the costs and the one-off costs have now come down from £28k to £25k due
to @ reduction in testing. The recurring monthly charges have been defended by my team as being
totally appropriate in order to provide the support required by the business and therefore are
OO cncneriand at £3.6k per month Dave H 18 Feb 2015

Personally reviewed the charges and have raised two specific points to the team where I'm looking
for comfort on the value for money. Depending on the response, the charges may reduce slightly
under this challenge. However, we need to recognise that there is a cost to taking calls onto the
desk, security, risk and change management as well as ensuring performance and value is achieved
through managing the operational relationship.

Status update — March 4th

+ Operational cost reduction: YTD savings at pd 10 is £94k and on track to deliver 14/15 forecast of
£254k. Breakdown on slide 7.

+ 15/16 savings: BSP activity has initiated a further 8 FTE savings (5x 3B; 2 x 2A; 1 x 2B) that are able
to go into consultation as part of the Wave 2 activity w/c 23 March 2015. Assuming 90 day
consultation the 15/16 effect is calculated as £256k (calculated as 40wks) with a full year effect of
£334k. These savings are not shown in BSP business case but rather as part of Kevin's wider wave 2
initiatives.

+ On-line training: go live 6" Feb. Initial feedback is very positive, e.g. from one of the Field Team
Leaders “what is apparent is the three who have completed all the modules are amazingly competent
and this must be testament to the work put into the compiling of the modules, the knowledge they have
retained has truly surprised me”.

+ HORIce : The pilot concludes at the end of March 2015. To ensure HORIce as a tool is optimised for
the business an owner for HORIce within POL needs to be determined. Ongoing costs need to be
confirmed also to enable this to be baton passed to the identified business owner at the end of March.

+ Agent Precautionary Suspensions - there are 37 suspensions this year at period 11 as a result of
audit and 123 where previously there would have been a disruption to service through a precautionary
suspension. £624k has been made good as a result.

Bureau de Change 2nd receipt: the transaction for customers paying by debit or credit card for bureau transactions was
changed in Sept 2014 to include an automatic re-print of the receipt which includes the card and identification details of the
customer, which needs to be presented in case of fraudulent use of the card. Since the change FSC has received 117
RFIs/Chargebacks totalling £221.5k of these115 branches were able to provide a copy of the 2nd receipt.

Cheque Rem out: the end of day cheque remittance process has been reviewed and a new solution to drive out errors has been
identified. Requirements have been signed off. The proposal to have Horizon print the Batch Control Voucher has been
dropped due to the added complexity and risk to delivery timescales. The change should reduce calls into NBSC (650 per
month) and the Transaction Corrections (c.570 pm periods 1-5 2014) issued by Finance Service Centre. CAF has been processed
detailing cost of £109k with savings of £85k pa from reduction in 3 FTEs at FSC and 0.5 FTE at NBSC however the go live has
been delayed from March to May due to capacity issues in the previous release. Recalculated savings for 15/16 are £63.8k

NBSC call number reduction target EX

(Action point 20150204.1) #1

Key performance benefit is a 25% reduction in call numbers to NBSC 2015/16

Strategically, ‘right first time’ will be a critical for Post Office in driving a more
efficient cost base. The culture of Post Office needs to underpin this and
excluding categories of unexpected or out of the norm call volumes could be
perceived as condoning excuse management rather than tackling the
underlying problem. We need to tackle head on the ‘unexpected’ as the
unexpected has a habit of happening.

Proposal to target the 25% call reduction on the categories where there is an
active plan in place, this would be the primary KPI and a year end outturn
target.

Secondary indicator/tracker would be the overall volume of calls impacted by
non specific improvement activity and root cause analysis

BSP recommendation — that these two measures are baton passed into NBSC.
objectives for 15/16. Is this endorsed by BSP Steering Group?

NBSC call number reduction target F
(Action point 20150204.1) #3 ©

Plan produced by NBSC features activity aimed at the specific areas of:- Telephone directory
calls; dangerous goods calls and stock code calls. Full year baseline for these specific areas:-

+ Telephone Directory Calls baseline 60360 calls, target a 25% reduction in 15/16 (15090
reduction outturn: 45270)

* Stock Code Calls baseline 17690 calls, target 25% reduction in 15/16 (4422 reduction
outturn 15/16: 13268)

+ Dangerous Goods baseline 8740 calls, target 25% reduction in 15/16 (2185 reduction
outturn 15/16: 6555)

The three areas above account for nearly 40% of all calls.

The remaining baseline would be 136998 - there are activities within the NBSC plan covering
for example - top contact branches; communications plans; crown contacts; user group; web
contact; etc. which will all impact in a more general way. (Included within this number 10902
Drop and Go calls). The effectiveness of these activities could be tracked with an aspiration
of achieving a 25% reduction, albeit a hard objective at start of year but following interim
review a specific number could be introduced?

Baton Passing

* To ensure that forecast savings are delivered in 2015-16, activities will be baton passed to the
appropriate budget holder and formal acknowledgment gained

+ 17 batons have been identified — draft example document circulated for information following last
months meeting

+ Delivery of the these batons will form personal objectives for the budget holders, who will be expected
to accept the baton with and electronic signature

+ Staff numbers have been removed from the 2015-16 template. If New Baton Owners want to put costs
back in for 2015-16, new Business Cases must be prepared and approved

+ Full Year savings start from 1 April 2015. If any slippage occurs, this must be recouped later in the
year, so that the Full Year total is still achieved

+ New Baton Owner is based on the current structure. If this changes, the baton and objective will pass
to the new budget owner
+ The BSP ends on 31 March and resources removed. New owners will therefore be required to

manage the Horizon changes that are already in progress through to go live, e.g. Cheque Rem Out
and Horizon Lost Connection Transaction Reversal and NBSC call numbers reduction — see next slide
