 Gareth

 I have scanned a few of the Branch Trading Accounts for analysis as agreed last night. I have more, but would
 envisage that this sample should be enough for you to prove whether she was hiding money in the cash in pouches
 awaiting collection figure and more importantly whether it was increasing.

 Subject: Draft Witness Statement


 All,

 It was good to meet you last night and put some faces to names and voices. Following that I've now attempted to
 draft a Witness Statement as discussed.

 <<0a06.Witness statement Gareth Jenkinsv0.l.doc>>

 Here is a first draft, and I'd appreciate feedback as to whether I have captured your requirements as to style and
 approach. I appreciate that you probably cannot comment on the factual content.

 As agreed, I need to do two further pieces of analysis and I've indicated with highlighted comments in boxes where I
 should include these. However I thought it was worth getting a first draft of the witness statement to you before doing
 that so you have a chance to review the Witness Statement in parallel.

 I've heard nothing further from Charles McLachlan regarding an updated version of his Report. Clearly, should such a
 report appear, I may well need to update the Witness Statement to reflect any changes.

 Regards

 Gareth
