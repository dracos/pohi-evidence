Hi Andy

Most of the recently requested data (ARQ 090-096) covered additional information for dates in which data had
previously been supplied. As such you have already produced a call log schedule & statement for this period.

ARQ 097 — 099 relates to a period of data (02/04/08 — 02/07/08) not previously requested. As such I need a call log
schedule for this period exhibited in the normal way in a further to statement. As you have previously supplied a
statement in this case you don’t need to cover off the generic bits which would have been on your first statement. Just
start it ‘Further to my previous statement I would now like to add the following’ .... You then
go on to explain that you were asked to obtain details of call logs for this ........PO for period which relate to
ARQ... - ... or however you word it. Then exhibit call log schedule and explain each call.

Once done can you e-mail direct to me please and post signed copy, exhibit label & schedule to me at:
Security Office, Swindon Stock Centre, Wheatstone Road, Dorcan, Swindon, SN3 5HG.

Thanks.

Hi Graham,
Can you clear this up for me please as am a bit confused..

In the attached e-mail you say that a further 2 years worth of data is required, is this correct and if so what are the
dates?

You have also asked if I can "produce statements covering the latest ARQS (P090 — P099) & data received (Penny)
and producing on a schedule all call logs within the period 02/04/08 — 02/07/08, with an explanation as to what each
means (Andy)"

Can you confirm the data range that is required for the helpdesk informationas ARQs P090 - P099 specify a number of
dates that span from 02/04/2008 (ARQ P0097) to 15/07/2009 (ARQ P0096).

Thanks

Thanks Penny

Yours is the main statement required, as the ARQ'’s & CD's need to be produced in order that I can then produce
schedules of analysis from them. If possible please would you e-mail me your statement once completed so that I can
submit a copy, with other docs to our solicitors by next Wednesday. I am out of office on Monday, so if you could have
statement e-mailed over by close of play Tuesday that would be greatly appreciated. You can post the signed
statement/exhibits in the normal way and I will forward that when I get Andy’s. I will advise solicitors that due to A/L
Andy's statement will be served no later than 31 August and hopefully that will be acceptable. Another witness is on
leave until mid August, so it won't be just Andy’s that is outstanding.

Mark

I have no request for witness statements for Swiss Cottage. I know that during my absence on June 20 Andy Dunks
picked up an email from Jane and subsequently left a voice mail for Graham and confirmed his action in a note to
Jane, copied to Post Office Security stating that the earliest we could provide this information was a week, but that
would be pushing it. I can find no further request for statements for Swiss Cottage.

My witness statement - I can provide a statement to cover the ARQ returns I have provided, Monday/Tuesday next
week,

Andy's witness statement covering call logs — unfortunately he is now on leave, not returning until Monday, 8 August —
he will need at least a week to produce this statement — we should allow two weeks to be on the safe side.

Hope this covers the questions posed.

Kind regards
Penny

I have received the CD ROMS that were requested in e-mail below but I have not received any indication as to how
quickly Penny and Andy can produce statements covering the latest ARQS (P090 — P099) & data received (Penny)
and producing on a schedule all call logs within the period 02/04/08 — 02/07/08, with an explanation as to what each
means (Andy)

The judge gave us until 31 July to ideally have produced everything on the Defence’s shopping list but certainly to
have a clear timescale by that date as to when anything outstanding will be produced. As such, would someone kindly
contact Penny / Andy to ascertain a timescale for these statements / schedule please.

Subject: swiss cottage data

Morning Jane

Sorry to pester you 1*t day back but defence in Swiss Cottage case have called a mention hearing which I shall start
travelling to in about 30 mins. They are effectively asking for a further 2 years worth of Horizon data for this branch
and for the data to show names of stock units transfers are being made to.

Would you be able to ascertain from Fujitsu by 13.45 today a rough indication of how long this data would take to
obtain, how much it would cost (i.e. if we have gone over our allotted amount of ARQs) and how quickly Penny could
produce a statement and how quickly Andy could analyse and schedule all calls to Helpline for this period and produce
in a statement.

Defence will be looking to adjourn trial today so I need an indication of how long all this will take and then to allow for
me to analyse all data, schedule, produce, statement etc.

Thanks.
