e M127

It was agreed that there is a need to focus on the issues that are relevant to the loss,
it was suggested that 1.6 should be amended to make clear which factors
contributed to the loss and which did not and focus on who is responsible for the
loss.

Post Office commented that the stylistic comments made on M022 apply to this
report as well. Further Post office made two overarching comments:

e They agreed on the need for focus.

e Secondly they commented that paragraph 4.4 assumes a relationship
between the SPMR and Post Office which if correct would have far reaching
implications for the financial model that Post Office is operating and who
bears responsibility for the loss.

ACTION stylistic comments to Second Sight by close of business 21 May.
ACTION Second Sight to circulate final draft by close of business 23 May.

« M054

Sight commented that it would be ready by close of business on 28 May.

3. Mediation

The Working Group reviewed the two CEDR documents (mediation process and
mediation procedure) tabled for review. In the discussion the following points were
made:

e For the Mediation Process - The Working Group would prefer remedies
sought to be set out in the mediation statement and agreed that Alan Bates
would circulate a circular to applicants asking them to prepare for this.

e For the Mediation procedure (which is issued to parties) — it was suggested
that point 4 dealing with Bankruptcy be replaced with the text below:

“The applicant should provide an agreement with the other party (Post Office) that
there is authority for the party to make the claim and settle it subject to the party
reporting back to their trustee in bankruptcy”

ACTION Post Office to consider the issue of bankruptcy and revert to the
Working Group but in the absence of a definitive agreement by Post Office as
POL00026662
POL00026662

that there would be a separate process for bankrupts.

e Timing — it was agreed that the date for mediation should be set within 4
weeks of the mediator being appointed

area.

10. Second Sight review progress

Second Sight updated the Working Group on their progress. They noted that their ability to
produce reports was constrained by staff availability, the need to reflect on learning and that
they now estimated that it was taking 8 weeks to produce a report not 4 weeks. Second
Sight commented that no work had been done on the reports when originally posted except
the three reports discussed by the Working Group in March.

In discussion Second Sight commented that they will aim to produce three reports a week
but that next week they would produce two draft reports.

ACTION Second Sight to confirm which reports would be produced to the Working Group.

Second Sight’s role in hardening cases was also discussed. It was agreed that Second
Sight should make the hardening process a more focussed process which would ensure
there is a sufficient caseload for the Post Office investigators.

Second Sight updated on the Part two report they commented that no further work has been
done on Part two and that they needed to complete more reports before they can complete
Part two.

Action Second Sight to provide a schedule for completion of Part two and their case reports
by next Thursday (29 May).

It was agreed that vulnerable applicants should be prioritised within the Second Sight
scheduling.

e Howe and Co extension requests It was agreed that Alan Bates would contact
MO96. It was agreed that the Secretariat would contact Howe and Co granting an
extension to the end of the month for M096 and requesting Howe and Co to
inform the Working Group what steps have been taken to contact the applicant
and why, M106 was granted an extension of 1 week.

¢ Aver — Aver’s continued failure to respond to approaches from the Working
Group was discussed. It was agreed that the Chair would ring Emma Porter to
convey the Working Group’s disquiet.

e CFAs - The issue of CFAs was discussed and the Chair updated the Working
group on the letter sent to De Nahlik highlighting the clause in the funding
agreement which ruled out the approach Mr De Nahlik was proposing. AB
commented that he had advised all applicants who had asked his advice to make
clear to their advisors that they had no funds available to them beyond the Post
Office contribution. It was agreed that the letter covering the final report to each
applicant should again draw applicants’ attention to both clause 4.2 and the
wording in the prospectus.

Next face to face meeting was agreed for Monday 16 June and subject to room availability it
will be held at Matrix Chambers.
