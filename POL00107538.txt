Dear Mr Bates

Thank you for your letter dated 7” August addressed fo Allan Leighton,
Chairman Royal Mail, which has been forwarded to me for reply.

I have now completed My enquiries into the issues you have raised
and, have spoken with a number of the personnel involved in the
search for a solution to the situation at Craig y Don Post Office®,
Although I regret that the situation has reached the point of termination
of your contract, I am confident that the various teams concerned in the
events have worked hard to Provide support and assistance to you ina
consistent and sympathetic manner. This support included a number
of on site support visits to assist with balancing and also extra training
on the Horizon system. The aim was always that of achieving a solution
to the difficulties you were experiencing in managing transactions and
processes at Craig y Don Post Office® branch,

' ‘The Sub Postmaster contract is clear on the requirement that

postmasters must make good losses or gains made when misbalances
occur and to bring error notices to account appropriately. It is evident
you have consistently refused to do this, even when specifically
Tequested to do so by the Area Management team. The Horizon
system at Craig y Don Post Office® has been reviewed and
interrogated in response to your complaints, and the reports from both
the Horizon Field Support team and the NBSC have confirmed that
there is nothing inherently wrong with the Horizon system installed at
the branch.

Your ref : C2331/41024

Dear Mrs Williams,

I have been asked to reply to your letter of 22 October 2003, to Allan Leighton
about Craig y Don Post Office® branch temporary closure, °

2003. The branch will Close for business at 17.30 on 3 November, to enable

Us to complete a final audit and decommission the branch the following day
before his contract expires, ; :

Itis not our wish to see this branch close, and ever since we gave Mr Bates
notice, we have been seeking a response from him as to whether he would be
Selling his business (thus allowing us the Opportunity to continue the Service
from the same location, albeit with new Subpostmaster) or if not whether he
would be willing to make his Premises available for temporary replacement
whilst a permanent appointment could be made. We have a Person ready to
Step in as temporary Teplacement, but it was only this week that Mr Bates
finally informed us he Was not willing to allow this fo happen.

‘Page 1 of 2

POL00107538
POL00107538

Meantime, we have been advertising for a permanent replacement and
currently have several interested parties with premises in the immediate
vicinity. Unfortunately, it will not be possible for any of them to be ina position
to take over on 5 November, indeed it is unlikely that anyone will do So until
the New Year, But! am optimistic that we will be able to make an
appointment very saon. :

I acknowledge the concerns of your constituents about the temporary
withdrawal of service. Indeed several have written directly fo us in similar
vein. Please assure them we have been, and are doing, all we can to

control that is not possible, If you personally can bring any pressure to bear

on Mr Bates to allow the temporary use of his premises, I would be grateful as

this would prevent the interruption of service we are facing. Meanwhile, we

are ensuring that facilities and staffing are increased at the main branch in

Vaughan St to Cope with the extra business caused by the Craig y Don @
closure. .

I will ensure you are informed when a permanent appointment is made, as we
will be consulting about the change in premises. Meantime, please let me
know if I can help further.

Yours sincerely,
