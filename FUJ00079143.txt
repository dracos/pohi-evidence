Segment 5 - late documents

I can now give you an update on the final two criterion outstanding from segment
5.

Criterion 472/13 - The document "Functional Specification for a generic
Acknowledgement Agent" is now available and is attached.

Criterion 479/5 - I confirm that the currently quoted documents will be replaced
with RS/PRO/032 - Security Event Management Process. This document is
unfortunately still undergoing internal review but I anticipate being able to issue it
at the end of this week.

Regards,

Dave Cooke
