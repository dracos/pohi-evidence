Amy, yes, that is correct. It was uploaded as a single zip file, and I would recommend downloading it and
unzipping to a folder in order to read them; because they are html files, they reference some of the other files
contained in the zip, e.g. the image files, so it all needs to be kept together in order to display correctly. I
first tried to allow your system to upload and unzip it into directories, but noticed that the relationships didn’t
work that way. Once unzipped it becomes quite large, around 40MB.

Below is some information from John Simpkins our expert on KELs.

It includes 8,388 KELs.

The old Horizon KELs can be identified by the heading text ‘HORIZON KEL’

eg.

HORIZON KEL achal0L

All HORIZON KELs are now obsolete, otherwise they would have been migrated to HNG-X kels.
HORIZON KELs will not be as easy to read as we switched mark-up formatting between the releases.

The KEL status will be either Authorised or Deactivated.

Amy,

I have now uploaded to the repository the documents as listed on the attachment.

Those listed on sheet DES APP HLD have been uploaded to the HNG-X folder, noting that those with WD
in column are no longer current for the current HNG-X solution and have been withdrawn.

Those listed on sheet TD ARC are in the Horizon folder.

Please let me know if you find any issues with any of the files, although I believe that they are all
straightforward Word documents and should present no problems.
