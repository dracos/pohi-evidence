Management Service.

1.3 Operational staff will be appropriately trained to carry out the Systems Management Service.

1.4 The Systems Management Service is based on remote unattended resolution. Monitoring,
under the Systems Management Service will, seek to minimise interruptions to the normal

2.1. Service Definition
2.1.1 Event & Systems Monitoring

2.1.1.1. The Systems Management Service will provide event and systems monitoring of both the
Branch Infrastructure and HNG-X Central Infrastructure. Events are the indications of
conditions that have operational significance to either the Branch Infrastructure or the HNG-X
Central Infrastructure. They include Software, Hardware or security conditions that may require
investigation and also include occurrences of particular, repeated events, for example, a low
battery in PIN Pads. Investigations will involve either other relevant Operational Services or a
defined recovery procedure.

2.1.1.2 All new platforms within the HNG-X Central Infrastructure will have the appropriate level of
performance monitoring Software installed and this will be available to the Systems
Management Service to enable systems monitoring to take place.

2.1.1.3 Fujitsu Services will ensure that all access to the HNG-X Central Infrastructure will be by
approved scripts that have predetermined functionality. Access is role based by SMC staff and
access is controlled by Safenet IKEY, which is fully audited by the CS Security Team.

2.1.1.4 The Systems Management Service includes the above Event & Systems Monitoring for active
POL Service types (for example Collect & Returns Support Service).

Management Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

2.1.2.2 Where an update to the Branch Infrastructure Software is required, new or updated Software
may need to be deployed and remotely installed across the HNG-X Telecommunications
Infrastructure to a specific Branch, all Branches, or a group of Branches. The distribution
process separates the transfer of Software from its subsequent installation, thus enabling the
installation process to take effect from a particular date or time. Updated Software can be
reversed out.

2.1.2.3 The Systems Management Service will maintain Software repository management through the
update of a Software inventory database which identifies which Software versions are stored
on the components of the Branch Infrastructure and the HNG-X Central Infrastructure.

Infrastructure and the Central Infrastructure. All platforms have access to an accurate time
source and this access is configured to ensure a consistent date and time across all Branches.
This caters for the handling of clock changes at the beginning and end of British Summer
Time. The Systems Management Service includes the above Time Synchronisation for active
POL Service types (for example Collect & Returns Support Service).

2.1.4 Operational Change Proposals (MSCs)

2.1.4.1 The Systems Management Service will create and/or impact Operational Change Proposals
(MSCs) in accordance with section 2.1.6 of the CCD entitled: “Service Management Service,
Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

2.1.5 Service Management

Service Infrastructure with status and system event notifications being received from Branches.
To ensure that Branch and Counter Availability is kept to a maximum and within the Branch
and Counter Availability Service Level Targets (SLT) detailed in the CCD entitled: “Branch
Network Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0011).

Were a system or network condition has been identified, the Systems Management Service
will raise an appropriate Incident via the Service Desk or directly via the Incident management
systems at the required severity to enable the issue to be resolved in accordance with the
document entitled: “POA Incident Management Process” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018).
