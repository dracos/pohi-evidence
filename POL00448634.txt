Postmaster Pulse
Survey

November 2023

POL00448634
POL00448634

Executive Summary

+ Compared to March 2023, there was a significant increase in the proportion of Postmasters pointing to a valued/equal
business relationship and a decrease in Postmasters selecting the bottom of the scales in the Pulse survey

+ Similarly, there was also a significant increase in the proportion of Postmasters feeling supported and a corresponding
decrease in the number of Postmasters selecting the bottom end of the scale

+ In terms of the questions which we use to indicate levels of trust, there were also significant shifts across the five metrics.

+ The biggest positive shift was for ‘Post Office interacts with me in a purposeful and engaging way’ with agreement rising
by 9%

+ In addition, although at a lower level of agreement, scores for ‘Post Office makes sensible decisions about things that
impact my business’ also rose by 8%

+ In terms of improvements Postmasters would like to see, unsurprisingly remuneration was mentioned most frequently
along with transparency/honesty and working closely with Postmasters. However, there were also positive mentions
around Area Managers and general positivity

+ Although there is still a lot to do, these results indicate that sentiment is moving in the right direction
