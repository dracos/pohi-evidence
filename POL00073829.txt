Is that right? I can’t believe that we don’t provide this as part of the sub postmaster training ~ seems like a serious gap?

Hi Simon

There is not a glossary around, I know we are guilty of falling into this trap even though I try to avoid it. We could
consider page on “on line help” but f would question how comprehensive and up to date it could be and whether
anyone would actually use it.

The trail below is the last communications I’ve had with Mr Etheridge. It may be useful to ask 2° Sight which acronyms
caused confusion here. I will be happy to try to interpret any accronyms 2” Sight are struggling with.

it did not help that Mr Etheridge was not the subpostmaster and had no concept of how the post office worked. I would
have expected his wife to be able to understand what I was trying to say though. It would be useful to get some
feedback as it would help my day job.

Good morning Andrew,

I fave attached my (ast email to Colin Burston, so you can read.

Lam stilt confused, reading your email the £109

‘0 was entered onto the ATM withdrawals obviously this
was a mistake due to the fact tie ATM was not operational. I know that it was entered, but when I
found out about the mistake I contacted J Irish for assistance & all that she would tellus is that we should
not have done the transaction but we did. What I need to know is how to get rid of the problem because
obviously the money was never dispensed. When you entered to £10,950 ATM dispensed total you will
have generated an apparent cash surplus. A cash surplus of £10,895.47 was duly declared and settled
centrally ~ as £10,950 was not proper to you this was an effective loss of £54.53 but the full value of the
surplus was transferred to your customer account. The rogue ATM entry was corrected by the issue of a
transaction correction for £10,950. This was settled centrally. So the 2 amounts settled centrally
effectively net off against one another on your customer account bar the small loss of £54.53. So the ATM
error is resolved. The loss will relate to the whole branch's trading balances ~ not just the ATM.

Again we were holding 11050 in the safe & Glenis Devin told us to enter the amount for the whole office,
which we did & she guaranteed us that every thing had corrected itself & we were owed money? Let's
assume that when this money was held in the safe unaccounted for, the branch was holding £10,000 in the
til, If a cash dectaration of £10,000 was made at this point let's also assume the branch was in batance ~

so there

is no discrepancy. If the £11,050 was then added to the till and a new cash declaration of £21,050
is made the branch would have a surplus of £11,050. This did not happen. Glenis asked on more than one
occasion for this cash to be declared but no surplus was generated until the one created by the rogue ATM
declaration discussed above.

Tunderstand that you go by the debt is real due to confirmation by transaction corrections & branch
discrepancies on the spreadsheet but these are the figures we enter & if not correct we need to rectify but
we do not get the correct information. every time we settled centrally it was on the advice of Troy

Gardener, we field back for the whole 30 days allowed on the last occasion but were then told that we could

incur a £2000 penalty for losing information. We calculate the debt based on transaction corrections
accepted by a branch and settled centrally and branch discrepancy declarations that have again been

settled centrally. If you make transactional errors we will issue transaction corrections to resolve where

POL-0070392
POL00073829
POL00073829

possible - as per the ATM error above. If a branch declares their cash incorrectly and creates an error,
they will then get an equal and opposite discrepancy when the cash is correctly declared.

On our fast audit last week we were told that the office is correct all the problems stem from the ATM. It
may well be that the cash shortages stemmed from cask shortages in the ATM. This does not mean the
ATM was at fault.

How can we resotve these problems our batance sheets are correct & our ATM sheets are correct. I see no
way of resolving these problems bar understanding why this surplus cash was not introduced to Horizon
cash stock thus creating the balancing surplus you needed. I understand that several different peopte
have visited you branch in an attempt to resolve your problems. I do not know of anyone who actually
saw the surplus unaccounted for cash you claim was field in your safe. This feels extremely odd that
people who were looking for surplus cash on site were not informed and shown the cash.

We fiave now closed the post office until these problems can be rectified.

Gareth

I am not sure where you have got your current debt figure from. The figure you have, may have included a debt being
recovered from pay. That element has now been cleared. The attached file shows the current total outstanding and how
it is made up i.e. transaction corrections in relation to ATM input errors and branch discrepancies declared at branch
trading.

There was a value of £10,950 entered onto ATM withdrawals after the ATM ceased to function. This resulted in the
transaction correction for that value and will have caused the bulk of the surplus branch discrepancy declared which
appeared to effectively off set the outstanding debt.

I have already explained at length of the requirement to ensure all cash, including any surplus cash held in the safe, to be
included in your cash declarations. If you hold this surplus cash that is not currently being declared then I would suggest
you use this to pay the outstanding amount. If all your cash is being declared then I am afraid it looks like there is a
significant debt to be addressed.

To clarify; transaction corrections are issued when Horizon entries do not match up with other supporting information
e.g £10,950 entered onto ATM withdrawals when the ATM machine file shows zero.

Branch discrepancies occur when the cash declared at the branch does nor agree with what Horizon has been told has
happened. So a huge credit discrepancy occurred when you told Horizon that £10,950 had gone out of the branch —
whereas it hadn't.

I hope this helps to clarify the value outstanding although I appreciate you will not be happy that the debt is real and
confirmed by transaction corrections and branch discrepancies in the spreadsheet above being settled centrally.

Andrew,

‘We need you help badly. We have been told now that we owe another £10230.18,
where do these figures come from. We entered the money we had in the safe £11050 Glenis
told us that everything would now be cleared. This has not occurred. We have not used the
ATM since July & has now been removed how can we owe all this money. I know that I was
in the wrong a number of times putting the wrong figures in on the 16.30 & dispensed but
our end of week figures always matched up.

My wife has had a nervous breakdown due to all of this & is unable to work So could you
please help
