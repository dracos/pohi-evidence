Thanks Judy, here is the Local version.

Better to be sure, I only ask as I wouldn’t know what it meant but then I don’t know much about audits at

all!

Sandra

I did try to amend the local version but I cannot download it as it comes up as read only!! Probably me, if you send me a
version I will update it. Re £150 I am with four of the team today so I will take a straw poll and amend if necessary

Has the Local version been amended too? Can you send it over please.

Judy - will all the team know what it means by ‘if greater than £150 when the trading statement is
prepared.'?

Thanks,
Sandra

Subject: Closure workaid

Many apologises Warren but I seem to be bombarded at the moment with issues relating to closures. I presume it could
be because we are doing so many at the moment or on this occasion I think it is because at my recent audit workshops I
have encouraged FSAs to attempt to recover any shortfall by a credit/debit card payment via FSC as this means the sum
is recovered immediately and saves POL the cost of attempting recovery at a later date.

The latest issue relates to, as stated above, a Postmaster paying a shortfall with his debit card direct to FSC. The FSA
then was not sure how to deal with the shortfall that obviously remained in the branch but had been made good via
FSC. What they should have done of course was to settle the shortfall to FSC either on completion of the trading
statement or use their global user to settle as a final account deficit. However to their minds there was no debt as they
did not do this, instead they left the deficit at the top of the snap shot and failed to complete a trading statement as this
would have required the debt to be settled. They state they did this as there are no instructions what to do for this
scenario in the closure workaid. I have managed to resolve the issue on this occasion with FSC but obviously it would
have been easier if the correct process had been followed in the first place. I have therefore added this amendment
(tracked changed for your ease) and attach for your consideration.

I hope this is OK

Regards Judy
