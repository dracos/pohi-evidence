Just spoken to Jane M from Post Office.

Instructions from Post Office Board are "do it". Make the application.

One point — Post Office Board did not enjoy what it read about Post Office in CIT Judgment (the "vitriol" points from the
Judge). Jane asks that we collectively bear that in mind and when drafting letters, witness statements etc we err on the
reasoned side of life — in other words fewer adjectives than normal — to try and demonstrate that we are very
reasonable.

But main point — instructed to do it.

I have predicted, to Jane, but not promised, that we would be likely to issue and serve at some point tomorrow ?

Subject: Application docs

In anticipation of (hopefully) getting the green light for this application from PO, please see attached the
application documents. There are various bits to be filled in (particularly references in the WS).

Grateful if everyone could take a careful look at all of these though.

I have gone for a time estimate for the hearing of 4 hrs. Thoughts on that appreciated too.

Thanks

Gideon
