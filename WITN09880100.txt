POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JONATHAN RICHARD HULME

1, MR JONATHAN RICHARD HULME, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION
1. I am currently employed by Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”) as a Solution
Architect on Fujitsu’s Post Office Account, with a particular focus on the Horizon

counter application.

2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters put to Fujitsu in Rule 9 Requests dated 16 June
2023 and 31 July 2023 (the “Requests”), to the extent I have or had direct
knowledge of such matters. Where I have referred to documents to assist my
preparation of responses to the Requests, the URNs of the relevant documents

are set out in this statement.

3. I was assisted in preparing this statement by Morrison Foerster, the recognised

legal representatives for Fujitsu in the Inquiry.

PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND

4. I graduated from Southampton University in 1983 with a first-class Joint Honours
Bachelor of Science degree in Physics with Computer Science and joined ICL
(later Fujitsu) in October 1983. I have held various roles within the company as a

software developer, then software designer, and later a solution architect.

5. I worked briefly on Legacy Horizon as a counter developer from June 2004 to
October 2005 and have very little recollection of Legacy Horizon. I have worked
on the development of the Horizon Online (“HNG-X”) counter since November

2007 which was later rolled out in 2010.

6. In light of the above, my responses to the questions in the Inquiry’s Requests are
focused on my knowledge of HNG-X only. This statement sets out a summary of
the complex technical position relating to the Inquiry’s Requests as I now recall
and understand it. Although I have referred to documents in preparing this
statement, in the time available, I have not reviewed every relevant technical
document. Accordingly, there may be technical details or exceptions that I have

misremembered or forgotten.

7. Given that the questions asked by the Inquiry relate to the behaviour of complex
software, my responses in this statement describe what the software was designed
to do. There is always the potential for defects to be presentwhich might mean the
software does not behave as it was designed. To the extent that I recall such

defects, these are described in this statement. However, the defects in this

Page 2 of 12

WITN09880100

statement are indicative only and are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all

relevant known defects.

SIMULTANEOUS LOG-INS

8. The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to explain whether it is possible for a postmasteror
“user” to be logged on to more than one node (or “counter”) simultaneously, using
the same User ID. This is not a straightforward question, as the relevant

functionality has changed over time.

9. In the context of HNG-X, simultaneous logon behaviour was specified by the use
case entitled ‘BAD-11 Log On to system v5.06 20110830’ dated on or around 30
August 2011 (the “Initial Log On Use Case”, FUJ00171897), notably (i) variation
BAD-3599 “Concurrent Log-on: Active Session Successfully Terminated’, which
can be identified from the left hand column of the Initial Log On Use Case, and (ii)

business rule BRU-701.

10.  Atthis time, business rule BRU-701 stated that “fa] User shall only be able to be
logged on to one Counter or Terminal (in a branch) at any one timé (see the
document entitled “_Design_Authority_Business_Rules_v5.09_20111207,

FUJ00171898, and dated on or around 7 December 2011 in this regard).

11. By way of background for the Inquiry, use cases provide a usercentric
specification of counter behaviour, and business rules state low-level business
requirements for the counter behaviour — these were written when HNG-X was
ported from Legacy Horizon, and were owned and maintained in Post Office

Limited’s (“POL”) Requirements system, “DOORS”. POL subsequently

13.

14.

WITN09880100
WITN09880100

decommissioned their “DOORS” system and ceased maintaining counter use
cases and business rules, so Fujitsu took on maintaining the use cases and

business rules as Word documents and Excel spreadsheets on behalf of POL.

During the time these use cases were in place, for example, if a user logged on to
asecond node, the system would identify if they were already logged onto a first
node. At this point, the second node displays message “MSG04002” and the user

could then choose to:

12.1. Continue logging on to the second node; or

12.2 Cancel logging on to the second node.

In the first scenario, where the user continued logging on to the second node, the
system marked the first node’s user session as having failed, but would only force
the first node to logout when that node next talked to the data centre. At least ina
development environment, not every type of interaction with the data centre
causes that node to force logout, although the exact details of this are outside my

area of knowledge.

A user can also lock the counter node, and then has to enter their logon credentials
to unlock the node (see variation BAD-3162 “Log on after Temporary Lock’, in the
Initial Log On Use Case). At this lock screen, another user can enter their user
logon details to logout the original user’s session on that node and return the node
to the logon screen (see variation BAD-3217 “Log off by a new user after temporary

lock- confirmed” and subsequent sections in the Initial Log On Use Case).

The position became more complicated following the introduction of changes
regarding Smart IDs / End User Management (“EUM”). See the document entitled
‘CP6701Att1’ and dated 12 December 2017 (FUJ00171899), which describes

changes impacting concurrent logon.

I am not the subject matter expert for the EUM changes, but I am aware of the

following:

16.1 A change to HNG-X was made through EUM to introduce “smart users”.
Following the introduction of this functionality, multiple Horizon user IDs

(HUID) could be linked to a Post Office user Identifier (“POID”).

16.2 BRU-701 was changed to say “/a] User shall only be able to be logged on
to one Counter or Terminal (in a branch) at any one time. Where a
<username> is linked to a <Post Office Identifier>, then the User shall only
be able to be logged on to one Counter or Terminal (acrossall branches) at
any one time.” See the updated use case entitled ‘BAD-11 Logon to system
v5.06 20221215’ and dated 15 December 2022 in this regard (“Updated

Log On Use Case”, FUJ00171900)

16.3 Auser linked to a POID can logon to more than one counter at once if their
other session(s) are locked - see the Updated Log On Use Case (in
particular variation BAD-3599) and updated business rules entitled
‘Business Rules FJ 20230215’ and dated 15 February 2023 (in particular

BRU-701, BRU-CP2368-1, BRU-CP2368-2) (FUJ00171901).

16.4 There were some issues / defects with the EUM changes, primarily around
(i) stock unit and branch balancing locking, and (ii) attaching a user to a
stock unit while still logged in to another locked node. I became involved
with these issues at the relevant time and wrote document ‘CP6925 Att2’,
dated 10 January 2019 (FUJ00171905) to address them. This change was

subsequently implemented and released. In particular, I note that:

16.4.1 Section 1 of CP6925 Att2 lists two Peaks recording incidents that
occurred in the live estate and which triggered this Change Proposal
(see PC0275532 raised on 27 November 2018 and PC0275564
raised on 28 November 2018, FUJ00171906 and FUJ00171918

respectively); and

16.4.2 Section 6.1.1 lists defects which were identified during the
investigation and design phase. In addition to the Peaks listed in
this section (copies of which are exhibited to this statement see
FUJ00171920, FUJ00171923, FUJ00171924, FUJ00171927,
FUJ00171931 and FUJ00171932). I also assisted in investigating
defect PC0279931 during September 2019 (FUJ00171933) which
regarded a user being unable to logon due to issues checking

Horizon user IDs and Post Office user IDs.

17. I When auser logs on or off from the system, information is recorded in the counter
log of the impacted counter, but these logs only exist for a number of days and are

not centrally recorded. A “reporting event” is also generated which is recorded in

Page 6 of 12
WITN09880100
WITN09880100

the branch database. See the events listed in version 7 of the document entitled
‘HNG-X COUNTER AUDIT EVENT IDS’ (DES/APP/HLD/2255) dated 18 May 2022

(FUJ00171938).

18. For the scenario where a user logs on to a second counter node when already

logged onto a first counter node, the following events are generated.

19. For the second node:

19.1 EventID 119 is written by data centre, which states “Concurrent login

detected for User <User Id>. Awaiting user response to continue or cancel”

19.2 If the user presses “continue” on the warning message (MSG04045 is used
instead of MSG04002 for a POID user) then the following two events are
written by the data centre for the second node (no matter whether the user

was a POID user or not):

19.2.1 A second EventID 119, which states “Existing session for User
<Userld> in Branch <Branchld> at Counter <Nodeld> marked as

failed.”

19.2.2 EventID 12, which states “User <User Id> logged on’.

20. When the first counter node then interacts with the data centre and is told its
session has failed, it logs off offline. No event is recorded by this node for the offline

logoff.

TIMESTAMPS IN THE AUDIT DATA

21. The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to explain how timestamps areset or recorded in the
“logfile” and synchronised across branch counter nodes. It is not clear from the
Requests which log file the Inquiry intends to refer to. I therefore address below
my understanding of log files in HNG-X in relation to which I have a degree of direct

knowledge:

21.1 Counter log file entries record the date/time using the local counter clock.

21.2 The event date/time on events generated by the counter clock. Event 12
(Logon completed), 101 (Failed Logon), and 119 (concurrent logon) are
generated by the Online Service Router (“OSR’) running on the Branch
Access Layer (“BAL”) platform in the data centre, but use the time of the
request sent by the counter which again uses the counter clock (but see

PC0280046 raised on 12 September 2019, FUJ00171943).

21.3. I understand that the clocks on counters and in the data centre are
synchronised via a network time protocol, but I do not have direct knowledge

of this.

22. I recall assisting with the investigation of defect PC0279931 (in September 2019)
(FUJ00171933) which regarded a user being unable to logon due to issues
checking Horizon user IDs and Post Office user IDs. A secondary issue found
during the investigation was that the counter clock had drifted 34 seconds from the
data centre BAL clock. This was raised as PC0280046 on 12 September 2019

(FUJ00171943). The clock drift made it difficult to compare event times, because

Page 8 of 12
WITN09880100
WITN09880100

prior to this defect the time of OSR events was generated using the BAL clock. As
a result of this Peak, the OSR was changed to use the counter message request
time sent so that all the events relating to a counter logon would use that counte’s

clock.

23. The issue of the clock drift was raised as PC0280437 on 3 October 2019

(FUJ00171944), which was handled by the Software Support Centre.

24. _Iam also aware that there was a major incident a few months ago where a time
synchronisation server reset itself back a number of years. This had a knock-on
impact on audit. I was part of the team tasked with investigating the issue.
Exhibited to this statement at FUJ00171946 is a copy of the paper prepared as a

result of those investigations.

OFFLINE TRANSACTIONS

25. The Inquiry has asked what the expected reporting would be in the “log files” when
transactions have taken place offline. However, in relation to HNG-X, it is not

possible to transact offline.

26. If auser tries to settle a basket offline, the counter waits for the response from the
data centre for 30 seconds and on time-out performs one automatic retry. If that
also times out, then the user can perform further retries or alternatively cancel the
settlement. On cancellation, the disconnected session receipts are printed, and

the user is then automatically logged-off.

WITN09880100

In terms of how this would be recorded:

27.1 The counter logs would show the basket being sent to the data centre, but

no response received;

27.2 The OSR logs would show whether the message was received and a

response issued by the data centre;

27.3 The Branch Database would record the basket only if the settlement

message was received; and

27.4 If the counter is automatically logged off due to time-out then it is logged off
Offline (since it cannot talk to the data centre) and so no logoff event is

recorded.

The counter will enter Recovery at next logon and, if needed, take the appropriate

action to bring the data centre back in line with the disconnected session receipt.

When the counter logs back on, the logon completed event (12) is recorded, and

if recovery runs then one of the following events is recorded by the counter:

29.1 111: Recovery Completed;

29.2 112: Recovery Completed with exceptions;

29.3 118: No recovery required; or

29.4 120: Recovery Failed.

ARQ DATA

30. In addition to the matters addressed above, the Inquiry has also asked a number
of follow up questions relating to the reliability and sufficiency of ARQ data
provided by Fujitsu to POL. Given my roles as a software developer, software
designer, and later a solution architect, I do not have direct knowledge of the
content of ARQ data or of any specific instances of when this data may have been
provided to POL. I am not therefore in a position to comment on the sufficiency of

the ARQ data provided over time.

31. In relation to the reliability of the audit archive from which ARQ data was extracted,
other than those issues outlined in this statement above, I do not recall any further
issues that may have impacted the audit archive. That being said, given that I am
not a subject matter expert in this area, I would not necessarily expect to have

been made aware of any issues in this part of the Horizon system.
