Meeting purpose

To consider the improvement opportunities from the Scheme; Second Sight’s
Thematic Issues; and the individual case investigations with a view to
incorporating into the Branch Support Programme which is tasked with improving
the effectiveness and efficiency of the support we provide to our branch operators
in the running of their post offices.

Agenda - whilst the focus is on three core areas a fluid discussion would be
beneficial hence no individual agenda items.

Mediation Scheme To ensure we have considered each of the
SS thematic issues and addressed the
issue and where appropriate put policy
and/or process improvements in place.

Case investigations To ensure we have identified the learnings
from the case investigations and where
appropriate put policy and/or process
improvements in place. Performance
opportunities to be articulated and
feedback to individuals/teams.

Branch Support Programme To ensure that any learnings and
improvement opportunities are captured
and considered and implemented as part of
BSP. Opportunities that are not
implemented before the end of March 2015
when BSP closes to be formally baton-
passed to business owners for completion
from April 2015.
