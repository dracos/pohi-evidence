We have not yet had an opportunity to discuss with Tony Hooper — comms are working on a draft which we will run
past Tony. Will try to do this before Wednesday.

Best wishes

Dear all,

Please see below email from James Arbuthnot’s office. Could you have a think about how we should respond and
advise next steps. It would be good to have a draft ready on Monday, with a view to sending to Janet on Wednesday.

Many thanks,
Avene

Dear Paula,

James has asked me to thank you for your letter of 12 June. He wonders whether you might send him
something to consider by way of a circulation to MPs by the end of next week. He would like to be able to
tell the MPs why no meeting is going to take place, and what progress is being made.

Might your office let him have something to consider, please?

Many thanks.
Yours ever,
Janet
