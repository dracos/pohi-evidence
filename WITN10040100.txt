POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF KEVIN GILLILAND

I, Kevin Gilliland, will say as follows:

1. I make this statement in response to a Request for Information pursuant to
Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006, regarding matters within Phases 5 and 6 of

the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry, dated 2 October 2024.

2. Iam truly shocked by what has come out of the Inquiry and have spent a long
time reflecting on what Sub Postmasters (“SPMs’”) had to endure. I can truly
say that I am horrified. I worked for the Post Office for most of my working life
and I was proud to work for such a trusted brand, with my father having been
a postman. With what has come out of the Inquiry, I now feel ashamed to
have been part of a business where so many lives were ruined. I hope that my

statement goes some way in providing answers.

3. I can confirm that I have had the legal assistance of Ashfords LLP in drafting

this statement.

BACKGROUND

4. I left school with 5 O Levels and joined Post Office Ltd (“POL”) in 1979, where
I had an extensive career until 2016. I cannot recall the exact dates that I held
each role at POL, or the precise role titles, but from memory these roles were

as follows:

a. 1979 — 1982: Counter Clerk - I worked as a Postal Office Counter
Clerk at the Crown Post Office in Northampton.

b. 1982 —- 1844: Remittance Unit Postal Officer — I worked in a
remittance unit, checking and preparing cash and stock remittances
received from, and dispatched to, post offices.

c. 1984-1985: Temporary Revenue Billing Task Force Manager — At
this time, all Royal Mail business customers were billed manually. My
role involved going around head post offices to enter the manual
records of the business customers and setting them up on the
computer so that they could get automated bills.

d. 1985 — 1986: Assistant Regional Cash Manager — I was responsible
for collating regional overnight cash holding reports and producing
Management Information Reports so that cash in Post Offices was

managed and controlled.

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

e. 1986 — 1987: District Customer Services Manager — I was
responsible for customer complaint handling and the monitoring and
production of the region’s service delivery key performance indicators.

f. 1987 — 1993: Client Services Manager — I was responsible for
introducing new products and changes to products in the Post Office
network working with the Royal Mail, Parcelforce and Bill Payment
account management teams.

g. 1993 - 1997: BT Account Manager — I was responsible for the
contract and relationship with British Telecom for bill payments and
sale and acceptance of savings stamps at Post Offices.

h. 1997 — 1998: Marketing and Partnership Development Manager,
Bill Payments — This role was established to defend POLs market
share in the bill payments market in light of rival competitive retail
networks being established. I had responsibility for marketing and
advertising campaigns and sales and awareness training for Post
Offices.

i. 1998 — 1999: Head of Network Banking — My primary role was to look
at the potential implications and strategy development if government
moved benefit payments from being paid through the Post Office, to
paying them direct to bank accounts, which it subsequently did.

j. 1999 - 2000: Head of Benefits Market — I was responsible for
account managing the Government Departments responsible for
benefits payments, for example the Department of Work and Pensions.

k. 2000 - 2004: Head of Business Requirements / Business Architect

— I was responsible for the development and implementation of Post

Page 3 of 109

42349433.1
42349433.1

WITN10040100
WITN10040100

Office Card Account (“POCA”) and the associated contract with the
relevant Government Departments for the provision of this service.
2004 — 2006: Head of Franchise Relationships — This was my first
network facing role as previous roles were client facing. I was
responsible for the account management of the National Federation of
SPMs (“NFSP”), including annual remuneration negotiations and the

management of SPM contract policy.

. 2006 — 2007: General Manager Multiples — Multiples are large chains

who run Post Offices, such as Co-Op and One Stop. I was responsible
for the account management and sales performance of these partners
and had a team of Field Managers who were responsible for sales

performance for this part of the network.

. 2007 — 2009: Head of Agency Development — I was responsible for

developing strategic relationships with existing and potential network
partners, including the NFSP, Multiples and retail trade organisations. I
was also responsible for SPM remuneration and contract policy as well
as the implementation and development of business tool and sales

training to support SPMs grow and defend their business.

. 2009 — November 2010: General Manager Commercial Agency /

Agency Sales Programme Director — I originally went into this role as
General Manager Commercial Agency but shortly after I took on the
role, Alan Cook (Managing Director at the time) gave me the objective
of restructuring the Agency Business Development managers to deliver
a savings target of £4 million. This changed the nature of my role and

my job title changed with it, to become Agency Sales Programme

Page 4 of 109
42349433.1

WITN10040100
WITN10040100

Director. I originally applied for the role to gain experience of running a
large network field team but the change in the focus of the role meant

that this development was limited.

. November 2010 — 2016: Network and Sales Director — I was

responsible for running the day to day operations of the network across
11,500 branches. However, it was the Network and Crown
Transformation programmes that took up the majority of my time and
attention. I was also given responsibility for the supply chain (the cash
logistics operation) and Property from around 2012 — 2015 when Mike
Young (Chief Operating Officer) left POL. When Pauline Holroyd (HR
Director) left in 2012, responsibility for the Communication Workers
Union (“CWU”), Communication Managers’ Association / Unite was
transferred to me (in addition to my responsibility of the NFSP). In 2014
responsibility for these relationships was transferred back to HR
(including the NFSP) when Neil Hayward (the new HR Director) joined
POL. In 2015, Supply Chain and property were transferred from me to

Al Cameron (the incoming Chief Financial Officer).

. 2016 - 2017: Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Retail — I was

responsible for product development, delivery and client account
management for Royal Mail, Government services, payment services,
retail and lottery. I was also responsible for the Network and Crown
Transformation programmes, the network development programme,
NFSP, the Crown network and line management and, agency sales
field support. This role came about a result of a reorganisation whereby

my previous role no longer existed and I stepped into the position until

Page 5 of 109
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

a suitable external replacement with retail experience could be
recruited. This happened in December 2017 at which point I was put on

gardening leave until June 2018 when I left POL.

5. Since leaving POL, I have carried out two pieces of consultancy work and a

Non Executive Director role. I fully retired in 2022.

THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM

6. When the Horizon IT System (“Horizon”) was first introduced to the business
in 1999, I was working in a Commercial Business Unit as Head of Benefits
Market, responsible for the production development and introduction of Post
Office Card Account (“POCA”). I can recall that POCA utilized the Horizon
system with pin pads being rolled out as a key component of POCA and
therefore my first experience with Horizon was on a practical level when trying

to introduce POCA.

7. All Head Office Managers, including myself, were required to work on the
counters during the Christmas period to help with the Christmas pressure. In
order to carry out this role, I received training on how to use Horizon, which
would have been either a half or a full day, delivered from a classroom. The
training was specifically delivered for people assisting with the Christmas
pressure and so it would not cover the full use of Horizon, but on how to
conduct the most common and standard transactions. For example, I think
that the training included daily individual cash and stock check, but not whole

Page 6 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

office balancing procedures. Should a more complicated transaction arise
during our shift, we would defer to the more experienced staff. I think that I
would also have received refresher training but I cannot recall when or how

often this would have been.

8. The first time I became aware of any bugs in Horizon was when two bugs
were reported in the Second Sight (“SS”) report in July 2013, POL00099063.
However, I remember being reassured that these had not caused any
detriment to any SPM as the bugs had been identified and corrected and I
was told that no SPM was out of pocket. I cannot remember who told me this
but I think that it was likely to have been delivered in an update at an

Executive Committee (“ExCo”) meeting.

9. Prior to this, I knew that Horizon went down from time to time and when I was
Network and Sales Director, I would receive complaints from SPMs, which I
have discussed in further detail below. However, these complaints never
appeared to be to do with something fundamentally wrong with the system,
but due to an individual issue, such as a faulty lead, as shown in
POL00145179 (email chain dated 4 July 2013), or a telecoms issue, as
shown in POL00105625 (email chain dated 11 December 2012). I have

discussed these documents in further detail below.

10. My understanding was that there would always be things that would go wrong

with computer systems but that these problems were minor (although could

Page 7 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

be very frustrating to the SPM) and would always be picked up and rectified

by the IT team.

11. It was only after I left POL, when I saw the High Court judgment and the
subsequent findings from the Inquiry that I became aware of the lack of
integrity of Horizon. These findings have completely shocked me as although I
was aware of cases where SPMs were attributing losses to Horizon issues, I
was always reassured that Horizon was robust, with this reassurance
reinforced by the fact the issue was being looked at by a dedicated team,

including IT and legal experts.

12. The Inquiry have asked me to lay out my understanding of ARQ data. It is not
a term that I was familiar with and from memory, the only time that I would
have had experience of it would have been in the Ferndown case (discussed
in further detail below). Here, I was shown by Helen Rose how data from
Fujitsu could highlight what happened in a branch, including the time and date
that transactions took place. It was my understanding (and still is my
understanding) that ARQ data is keystroke data which shows every entry that
someone has made into Horizon and that this data could be used to look at
the history of all transactions, stock and cash and identify each interaction
with the system by user and stock unit. To the best of my knowledge, the only
time this term came up was in the Ferndown case meeting when Helen Rose
walked us through the relevant branch data to show us what transactions had

taken place in that particular branch and who had conducted them.

Page 8 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

13. Throughout my time at POL it was my understanding that there could be no
remote access by Fujitsu employees to alter transaction data or data in

branch accounts without the knowledge or consent of SPMs.

14. I knew that transaction corrections could be made by the central POL team in
the Chesterfield office but that SPMs were always aware when these were

issued as they had to accept them.

15. This message is in line with POL00294728, an email from Tracy Marshall to
myself, Angela Van Den Bogerd and Helen Rose in the late afternoon of 5

January 2011 which states that:

“Fujitsu can remotely access systems [but] the authority process required and
the audit process are robust enough to prevent this activity from being
undertaken fraudulently...so although changes could be made remotely, they

would be spotted and the person making the change would be identified.”

16. Similarly, the briefing note for the meeting, POL00142625, states

“Any technical changes by Fujitsu that impact the system have to go through

clearance processes which would prevent any amendment to existing data”

17. Itis clear that the documents state that Fujitsu did have access but that there
were strong controls in place which prevented Fujitsu from remotely

Page 9 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

accessing and amending any transaction data. This is not in line with my
recollection on remote access prior to these documents being disclosed.
From my recollection, until 2016 I believed that Fujitsu did not have any
access. This changed around 2016 when Jane MacLeod informed ExCo that
Fujitsu did have access, but that this was controlled. I can recall myself and
others being shocked at this change in message and it is clear to me now that
the information provided on remote access in January 2011 (referred to in the
paragraphs above) did not register with me. I am confident that if it had, I
would have questioned the message that Fujitsu did not have any remote
access and this would have been investigated straight away as I understood it

was in 2016.

18. Since leaving the business and following the findings of the Inquiry I now
know that Fujitsu did in fact have uncontrolled remote access to Horizon. At

no point during my time within the business did I ever know this.

19. The Inquiry have asked me about POL00041564 which is a Computer Weekly
article entitled ‘Bankruptcy, prosecution and disrupted livelihoods —
Postmasters tell their story’. The article is dated 11 May 2009 which was
before my time as an executive team member of POL and I was not party to
any discussions about it. Indeed, I cannot remember seeing it or even hearing
about it at the time of its publication and I think that the first time I read it was

when it was provided to me in my disclosure pack by the Inquiry.

Page 10 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

20. The Inquiry have also asked me about POL00026572, which is a report
written by Rod Ismay, Head of Product and Branch Accounting entitled
‘Horizon — Responses to Challenges Regarding Systems Integrity’ dated 2
August 2010. Again, this was before my time on the executive team and I am
not copied in as an original recipient of the report. Whilst I cannot remember if
I ever read the report, or my original reaction to it, I believe that if I did it would
have strengthened my confidence in the Horizon system as it makes clear

that “Horizon is robust”.

OPERATION OF POL AND HORIZON

21. I have been asked to summarise the nature and extent of my involvement
with, or oversight of, POL’s provision of advice and assistance to SPMs in
respect of disputed shortfalls in branch accounts. In answering the Inquiry’s
questions on this topic I have reviewed the documents listed below, which
date from 2004 — 2013. Please see the section ‘POL’s response to complaints
from 2014 onwards’ for concerns with Horizon that were dealt with after this

date.

a. POL00444612 (Email chain dated 29 July 2004)
b. POL00363086 (Email chain from Victoria Noble to me on 4 July 2005)
c. POL00326693 (Email chain dated 25 July 2005)
d. POL00015020 (Email from Maureen Moors to me dated 20 May 2010)
e. POL00403835 (Post Office Ltd Internal Review of Agents Processes in
Managing Suspected Financial Irregularities, dated 17 January 2011)
Page 11 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

f. POL00434015 (Email from Christina Wood to me on 25 February
2011)

g. POL00405605 (Email chain dated 17 May 2011)

h. POL00338648 (Email chain dated 20 February 2012)

i. POL00105625 (Email chain dated 11 December 2012)

j. POL00184326 (email chain dated 13 December 2012) and attachment
POL00184327 (letter from Ronnie Campbell MP to NFSP dated 6
December 2012)

k. POL00316792 (Email from Jane Hill dated 5 June 2013)

I. POL00145179 (email chain between myself, branch investigator and
others, dated 4 July 2013)

m. POL00099179 (Email chain between SPM David Woodrow, Paula
Vennells, myself and others, dated 12 July 2013)

n. POL00298435 (Emails between SPM Pervez Nakvi, dated 21 August

2013)

22. Prior to my role as Network and Sales Director (from November 2010) I only
had very peripheral involvement with concerns raised about Horizon, with the

documents listed above only showing my involvement on three occasions.

23. The first of these, POL00444612 shows me copied into an email chain dated
29 July 2004. I cannot recall this email chain but reading it now, it appears
that Mandy Talbot (Royal Mail Group Legal), has asked John Legg (Agency
Contract Manager) to suggest someone who is able to produce a statement

compiling a list of the types of goods and services supplied by SPMs. John

Page 12 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

suggests to Mandy that the people best placed to supply this information
would be someone from the retail line or audit manager. However, he states
that he is about to go an annual leave for two weeks and suggests a number
of people who may be able to help in his absence including Chris Howard
(Agency Pay Manager). I assume that he has copied me in because at the
time I was Chris and John’s line manager. Neither John, Chris or I were part
of the retail line or audit teams. I do not recall what happened following this

email chain.

24. The second of these, POL00363086, is an email chain from Victoria Noble
(Head of Product and Branch Accounting), forwarding information on what
was known as the ’42 day issue’. The email explains that this is an issue
where the transaction correction process means that instead of an error
notice, a branch will receive an electronic transaction correction at the branch
which the SPM will be expected to ‘action’ before they are able to roll over the
monthly branch trading. The SPM will be given a number of options and if
they do not action any of these options, then they cannot roll into the next
period. As Horizon only holds data for 42 days, this means that there is a
“slight risk” that the SPM may find Horizon becoming unstable and unable to
maintain service (hence the 42 day issue). I am copied in because a meeting
was going to be held with the NFSP about this issue and, at the time, I was
responsible for the relationship with the NFSP and so would have facilitated,
although not necessarily attended, this meeting. I believe the meeting would
have been led by Victoria Noble. I also had responsibility for the NFSP as
Network and Sales Director and so from time to time the NFSP would bring

Page 13 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

relevant documentation and correspondence on Horizon to my attention for
information or action as seen in POL00184326 (email chain dated 13
December 2013) and attachment POL00184327 (letter from Ronnie Campbell

MP to NFSP).

25. POL00326693 is an email chain dated 25 July 2005 where my advice is
sought as to the contractual arrangements around what happens if a branch
fails to roll branch trading at the appropriate time. At this time, I was Head of
Franchise Relationships and had responsibility for SPM contracts. The
contracts were already in place, but my role was to advise on what was
contained in them from a business point of view. This question was about the
Franchise Agreement with my advice sought as to what the contract said
about SPM responsibilities in respect of disputed shortfalls. I cannot recall this

discussion beyond what is contained in this email chain.

26. When I became Network and Sales Director I started to be more involved with
concerns that were raised about Horizon although I recall that from around
2010 onwards, when the pre-litigation started, there was a process in place to
centralise all Horizon-related concerns, which were dealt with by Group Legal,
POL Legal and subsequently Project Sparrow and the dedicated teams that

were set up to investigate and review cases.

27. Although I was not aware of all concerns raised, I would be informed of high
value / high profile concerns. For example, I was notified when an audit
revealed a shortage of £38,477.70 as at POL00015020 (email from Maureen

Page 14 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

Moors to me dated 20 May 2010) and when an audit revealed a shortage of
£46,314.48, as at POL00434015 (email from Christina Wood to me dated 25
February 2011) because the losses were so large. I cannot recall if there was
a threshold loss amount above which I would be informed. Similarly, I am
copied into POL00105625, an email chain dated 11 December 2012
concerning an ongoing issue with Horizon crashing multiple times a day over
the Christmas period due to an issue with ‘Talk Talk’. If a concern was
particularly important, Paula Vennells might ask me to have oversight of it, as
shown in POL00099179 (email chain dated 12 July 2013) where Paula asked
Susan Crichton and myself to look into a complicated case concerning
payment of Scottish ATM rates. Similarly, I was blind copied into
POL00298435, Paula Vennells’ emails to SPM Pervez Nakvi dated 21 August
2013, who contacted her directly about a Horizon issue. I would have been

copied in not to take action but so that I was aware of the issue.

28. I took a hands on approach to my job and as often as I could, I would attend
SPM meetings and NFSP branch meetings where any members could attend.
At these events I would often give out my mobile phone number so that SPMs
could contact me direct if needed, for example if they wanted to escalate a
problem to me because they were not getting the response they needed from
the business. I found it to be a really useful way to receive early warnings of
any potential problems within the network and how these were affecting
SPMs. Such an example of a SPM contacting me is shown in the email chain

dated 17 May 2011, POL00405605, where a SPM raised a concern with me

Page 15 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

about a LINK issue and I was able to forward it to Rod Ismay for resolution

(Head of Product and Branch Accounting).

29. Another example of a SPM contacting me direct to raise a concern is in the
email chain dated 4 July 2013, POL00145179. From what I recall, the SPM
contacted me because she had an Outreach kit which kept failing and for a
long time, it was not properly fixed. Every time that she contacted Fujitsu and
they thought the problem had been resolved, they would close the call log
meaning there were no records to show that this was a recurring issue. In the
end, the problem ended up being a faulty lead in the SPM’s equipment but I
fed back the problem of the call logs to Lesley Sewell (Head of IT) so that a
new process could be put in place to prevent call logs being closed so that

Fujitsu had better visibility of ongoing problems.

30. I would also go out on branch visits where SPMs could raise issues with me
that I would report back to POL, as shown in POL00338648 (email chain
dated 20 February 2012). I think it is important to stress that most of the
concerns SPMs raised with me were operational issues, not issues with
losses on Horizon which, wrongly and to my deep regret, reinforced my belief

that the system was working as it should.

31. Anyone within POL could escalate a problem with Horizon. The primary route
for problems with Horizon was through the NBSC (POLs helpline) or the
Horizon service help desk. The help desks had a tiered system for escalation

and if a SPM was account managed, they could escalate issues through their

Page 16 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

field manager. Other forms of escalation included SPMs writing direct to a
Director in POL. Names and job titles of all Board members and the Executive
were published on POL’s website. In some instances SPMs would write to
their MPs who would contact POL on their behalf. My understanding was that
any problems concerning Horizon would ultimately be reported to the IT team

who would involve Fujitsu as required.

32. Prior to the publication of the SS report, I do not recall being made aware of
anything which made me concerned that the advice and assistance available
to SPMs was not adequate, although there may have the occasional ad hoc

complaint which would be usual in an operation of this size.

33. It was only when SS published their interim report that issues with advice and
assistance provided to SPMs came to light. I felt that POL took this very
seriously and set up the Branch Improvement Programme to look at all of the
recommendations from SS. I have discussed the Branch Improvement

Programme in further detail below.

34. I was not involved in any of the development, delivery or oversight of the
Horizon training, either for its initial roll out or for any later versions. However,
as Network Sales Director I had oversight of training and from memory, this
was delivered by Field Support Advisors (“FCAs”). Separately, there was also
a team responsible for general classroom training which also sat in my
directorate. Although I had oversight, I was not involved in training on a day-

to-day basis. If there were any issues that needed bringing to my attention, I

Page 17 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

would expect these to be escalated to me by my direct report. Similar to
above, I cannot recall training ever being raised as an issue at any of the
events I attended with SPMs and I cannot recall it being raised by any of my
direct reports. It was only when SS published their report that I became aware

of the issues.

35. When I became Network Sales Director in November 2010 I had oversight of
the Branch Audit Team. Angela Van Den Bogerd (Head of Network Services)
had direct responsibility of the team until August 2012 and she reported to
Sue Huggins (General Manager Network, Sales and Transformation), who
was a direct report to me. Following a restructuring of the SPM field support
teams around December 2012, Michael Larkin (Head of Agency Network)
who was another of my direct reports, took over responsibility for all the
agency support field teams including the Audit team, with Sue Huggins
leaving POL. In September 2012 when Angela moved to a new role, I believe

Drew McBride replaced her and reported to Michael.

36. Although I had general oversight of the audit team, on a practical level, I had
very little involvement with audits. I believe I received a monthly report which
covered high level information such as the number of audits that had been
carried out and if there were any large discrepancies. I think there was also a
quarterly report that went to the Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”). The
audits would be formally scheduled and I did not receive the results of
individual audits as these would go direct to one of the Contract Managers
who would decide, based on the evidence they heard, what (if any) action to

Page 18 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

take, based on the audit findings. I had monthly one to one meetings with my
direct reports where any issues that I needed to be aware of could be raised

with me or they would raise more urgent issues with me at anytime.

37. I was involved in internal audits where they covered my areas of
responsibility, such as POL00086765 (Network auditing approach, methods
and assurance dated 1 January 2013). This gave a low assurance score and
would have indicated to me that the processes in place were not currently
adequate and provided areas for improvement. I cannot recall exactly, but
from memory the usual process in response to internal audits would have
been as follows. The findings of the internal audit would be discussed and
agreed with the senior managers responsible, Drew McBride for the SPM
Network, Roger Gale for the Crown Offices and then me as the Executive
Sponsor. I believe the agreed recommendations and action plans would then
be approved by the Executive and ultimately the ARC, where progress would
also be monitored. POL000868371 is an options paper dated 1 October 2012
setting out options for the ExCo and the ARC to consider in respect of the
approach to internal audits (as opposed to branch audits), including an outline
of the findings and issues arising from the detailed review of auditing work
undertaken by the Field Support Advisors within Network Operations. I have
not been given any documents that show the outcome of the discussions at
ExCo or the ARC but I seem to recall that the option of separating the branch
audit and training functions was not felt to be an appropriate course of action
to take at this time because it would cause quite a lot of disruption particularly
as this team had been expanded to support the Network Transformation

Page 19 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

programme. I do however, think that the other recommendations would have
been accepted and delivered either through business as usual and/or the

Branch Improvement Scheme, although I cannot say for definite.

38. POL00379712 is an email from Peter Wilkinson, Area Manager, dated 8
January 2013 sending me an audit report, POL00379713, dated 12
December 2012 from Pulborough which shows a shortage of £19,669.53.
Although I cannot remember this specific case, I understand that the branch
was audited because it was identified as a risk because it was reported as
holding too much cash for the size of the branch. POL00179484 (Financial
Branch Performance Profile trial results dated 14 March 2012) is an example
of how we were trying to make branch audits more effective and targeted by
taking more of a risk based approach. We were trialling revised profile audits
to increase the efficiency of detection levels and also earlier detection of
losses. Similarly, through the Branch Improvement Programme a key aim was
to detect losses before they got large and provide support and help to these

SPMs.

39. As Head of Franchise Relationships I was responsible for SPM and Franchise
contracts and so would sometimes provide advice on what the contractual
requirements were following a dispute, as shown in POL00326693 (email
chain dated 25 July 2005). Other than this, I cannot recall having any
involvement with or oversight of POL’s procedures for resolving disputes with

SPMs in respect of discrepancies in branch accounts.

WITN10040100

40. When I came into the role of Network and Sales Director I would sometimes
have involvement in cases concerning branch discrepancy disputes that went
through to the Executive Correspondence Team (discussed in further detail
below). However, I believe that it was primarily the role of the Financial
Services Centre (“FSC”) to deal with disputes with SPMs in respect of
discrepancies in branch accounts. The FSC reported into the Finance

function.

41. The Inquiry have disclosed POL00403835, entitled ‘Post Office Ltd Internal
Review of Agents Processes in Management Suspected Financial
Irregularities’. This is dated 17 January 2011 and was drafted by Tracy
Marshall. I do not remember this document or why this process was being
reviewed. However, in November 2010, shortly before I became Network and
Sales Director, there was a restructuring of the Network Development and
Outlet Support Teams with the two teams merging to become one, headed up
by Sue Huggins. Whilst I cannot say for sure, this restructuring may have
been a catalyst to review the policies relating to the Outlet Support area

managing financial discrepancies.

42. I have been asked to set out my knowledge of POL’s prosecutorial function, in
particular its use of Horizon data to pursue prosecutions against SPMs. Apart
from receiving general updates about prosecutions, such as those contained
in POL00303045 (Significant Litigation Report dated 1 February 2013), I had
very little knowledge as to how the prosecutions worked in practice as these
fell under the responsibility of POL Legal (and Royal Mail Group Legal prior to

Page 21 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

2012). I completely trusted my professional peers and it was my
understanding that full evidence, including Horizon data, where necessary,
would be gathered and considered to ensure that every consideration was
given prior to prosecution. I also believed that the Courts would check and
test that the evidence was accurate and I took comfort that lawyers had

control and oversight of prosecutions.

43. As referenced above, from around 2010 onwards, when the pre-litigation
started, I believe there was a process in place to centralise all Horizon-related
concerns, which were dealt with by the Legal team and subsequently Project
Sparrow. I did not have any direct involvement in this but I might be asked,
from time to time, to gather information. I have discussed this in further detail

below under the section ‘Shoosmiths litigation and 2011 media coverage’.

FERNDOWN

44. The following deals with my recollection of an interview held at Ferndown Post
Office on 6 January 2010. I was asked to become involved in this case when I
was in the role of Head of Agency Sales / Agency Sales Programme Director.
This was a high profile case that involved both Dave Smith (Managing
Director at the time) and Paula Vennells (Network Director at that time). I
believe that Paula approached me to ask if I would try to resolve the problem
because the SPM had had her contract terminated and it was attracting a lot
of media attention and she thought that POL’s reaction was disproportionate
in relation to the discrepancy. I was brought in to try and understand what had

Page 22 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

happened and to try and resolve the issue with a fresh pair of eyes. At the
time, I had no experience with the audit and training team and so I think Paula
thought I would be a good person to get involved as I could be objective. This

was the first and only SPM interview that I was ever involved in.

45. Lynn Hobbs (General Manager Network Support) had oversight of the branch
audit function and had been asked to review the case so I started by speaking
to Lynn. She explained that matters had escalated because Mr/Mrs Athwal
were no longer allowing the branch to be run by the temporary SPM and
therefore the branch was closed. Lynn had discovered that there were Priority
Mail items and a passport application locked in the safe and Mr Athwell was
refusing to release the items. He said that he would not allow the branch to
reopen until his wife had been reinstated. I phoned Mr Athwell to try to get him
to release the mail and passport form and reopen his branch but he refused.
Lynn and I then discussed the situation with Dave Smith (POL Managing
Director). Dave’s view was that unless the situation could be resolved in the
next two working days, we should reinstate Mrs Athwell so that we could get
the Mail and passport form. Lynn and I concluded that under the
circumstances we should reinstate. We cleared this with Paula Vennells who
agreed with the approach and cleared this with Dave Smith. I spoke to Mr
Athwell again and informed him we would reinstate his wife and requested his
wife to meet with me and others within POL so that we could try and
understand what had happened and get the relationship back on a positive

footing. Mr Athwal agreed and I said that I would write to his wife to set up the

Page 23 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

meeting. POL00294717 is the letter from me to Mrs Athwal sent on 6

December 2010.

46. Between this conversation and the interview taking place, I moved into the
role of Network and Sales Director. I would not have been involved in the
preparations and setting up of the meeting or who the POL attendees should
be because I didn’t have the background, knowledge or experience in this
area. By this time, Sue Huggins, (General Manager Network Services and
Transformation) had now taken responsibility for this area and was a direct
report to me. I would have asked Sue to make the preparations and
arrangements for the meeting. However, Sue was on annual leave for the
meeting and Angela Van Den Bogerd deputised for her in this role (at this
time Angela was responsible for the Branch Audit team and was a direct
report to Sue). I can see from the papers, POL00294705 and POL00294707,
that ahead of the meeting, on 3 January 2011, Tracy Marshall emailed Angela
Van Den Bogerd and myself with details of the background to the case and a
meeting was held ahead to discuss the case, with a Briefing Paper,
POL00142625, provided. Late in the afternoon, the day before the meeting
Tracy Marshall also sent POL00294728, an email to myself and Angela Van
Den Bogerd with information on Horizon Network Performance, POL or
Fujitsu having remote access to individual horizon systems and the
independent review of Horizon system integrity. I have seen a copy of an
undated briefing note, POL00294706, which appears to have been prepared

in advance of the meeting.

Page 24 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

47. The meeting was held on 6 January 2010 with Angela Van Den Bogerd
(Network Change Operations Manager), Helen Rose (Tactical Analyst,
Security) and myself from POL, Mr and Mrs Athwal and Mark Baker
(representative from NFSP). It was my role to lead the meeting but I had little
operational experience in this area and so it was important that Angela was
there, as she had a deep understanding of the operation of branches, and that
Helen was there, so that she could speak to the technical aspects of the

Horizon logs.

48. Arecord of the meeting is at POL00294743 (interview notes dated 6 January
2010). Following the meeting I requested branch data from Fujitsu to be sent
to Mrs Athwal via discs as requested by her in FUJ00224980 (email chain
dated 10 January 2011). There is an email chain which shows that Mrs Athwal
sent a letter around a month later, on 15 February to which Fujitsu drafted a
response, POL00294761 (email from me to Angela Van Den Bogerd and
Peter Johnson on 17 February 2011). I ask to hold off our response until we
have spoken to Legal. My recollection was that whilst we could not come to
an agreement in the meeting, we all agreed that we would put the matter
behind us and that there would be no recriminations. This recollection is in

line with Angela’s email which says

“It’s interesting to see the list of questions posed by Mr Athwal given that we’d

agreed to wipe the slate clean and move forward.”

Page 25 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

49. My recollection of the meeting itself was that with the use of the Horizon logs,
Helen presented evidence of how the disputed loss was put into a dormant
account and she was able to identify who made the transfers and at what time
and date, which confirmed to me that the disputed entries were entered by the
people working in branch. Both Angela’s and my response in POL00294761
(email chain dated 17 February 2011) were based on the complete belief that

Horizon was robust.

50. It is only now, following the information which has come to light in the case of
Mr Bates and Others v Post Office Ltd, as well as the Inquiry, that I am able to
properly reflect on the information provided at this interview concerning both
the integrity of Horizon and the ability to add or amend transaction data. At the
meeting, I had complete belief that Horizon was robust and thought that the

information provided was correct.

51. The issue of Horizon’s robustness and remote access was covered in the

briefing paper POL00142625 (undated) which states:

“POL cannot remotely control a branches system...Any technical changes by
Fujitsu that impact the system have to go through clearance processes which

would prevent any amendment to existing data”

52. An email sent by Tracy Marshall the day before the meeting, on 5 January

2011, at POL00294728 also states:

Page 26 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

“POL cannot remotely access systems and make changes to specific stock
units etc. Fujitsu can remotely access systems...technically, Fujitsu could
access an individual branch remotely and move money around however this
has never happened yet. The authority process required and the audit
process are robust enough to prevent this activity from being undertaken

fraudulently”.

53. In the interview, I say that POL cannot manipulate data and Angela Van Den
Bogerd says that Fujitsu cannot manipulate data “without being seen to have
done that”. Since leaving POL I now know that this is incorrect, and Fujitsu

had uncontrolled access to branch accounts.

BBC INSIDE OUT

54. When I was on the Executive team I was often copied into emails on high
profile matters. POL00294745 (email from Paula Vennells to me and others
on 26 January 2011), POL00294746 (email chain dated 27 January 2011),
POL00120451 (email from Mike Granville to me on 4 February 2011) and
POL00294779 (email from Susan Crichton to me and others on 18 February
2011) are all examples of such emails, updating me and the team on the BBC
Inside Out programme and what POL’s response to the programme was. This
was the extent of my involvement as I would not have been involved in
actually formulating the response but merely kept up to date on POL’s

position.

Page 27 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

55. As I was not a member of the Board I do not feel able to comment on their

views as to the reporting.

SHOOSMITHS LITIGATION AND 2011 MEDIA COVERAGE

56. My only involvement in POL’s response to litigation threatened by Shoosmith /
Access Legal was to provide information as and when required to feed into a
particular case. For example, Legal might contact me with the background of
a case and ask for network-related information, as shown in POL00056782
(email dated 26 August 2011). I would either be able to answer the questions,

or refer them to the best person placed to answer these questions.

57. As shown at POL00379142, on 19 November 2010, Seema Misra’s husband
copied me and others into an email he had sent to Amnesty International
asking them to help his wife, following the outcome of the Court Case and her
(wrongful) imprisonment. Paula Vennells asked me, Susan Crichton (General
Council) and Sue Huggins (General Manager Network Services and
Transformation) to look into this. Sue Huggins and I took a decision not to
reply because the POL recipients were only copied in to the email and this
was not a matter that we could assist with. This was clearly the wrong
decision and even though at the time we believed (wrongly) that there had
been a fair trail and I do not know what we could have done at that stage
given she would have needed to appeal her conviction, it is still no excuse for
not responding and seeing whether there was any particular support or
assistance, which would have helped her and her family at such a distressing

Page 28 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

time for them. I deeply regret this and offer my unreserved apology to them
and their family. POL00379142 shows that on 1 and 2 of December 2010, Mr
Misra emailed me and others in POL asking us to help his wife in prison. Sue
Huggins replied on 3 December suggesting that he takes up some of the
issues directly with the prison service and that the matter is out of the hands
of the Post Office. This email response was inappropriate and we should have
offered more help and support. Mr Misra wrote to the prison service again on
7 December 2010 copied to myself and others in POL, POL00379142. I can
see from the email chain that we chose not to reply. We should not have
chosen to leave the matter solely to the prison service. I am truly and deeply

sorry that we didn’t.

58. On 8 February 2011, following the BBC programme into Horizon, Mike

Granville emails myself and others saying:

“In terms of next steps on the issue (for example the threatened civil legal
challenge by Shoosmiths that was mentioned in the programmed), I'll liaise

with Kevin Gilliland, Susan Crichton and Mike Young” - POL00294749.

59. I think that Mike’s reference to liaising with me, Susan and Mike was in order

to cover the areas of Network, Legal and IT Fujitsu respectively.

60. I can also see that on 24 November 2011 I was copied into an email,
POL00338518, to keep me informed of POL’s response to a BBC programme
which was being run on Horizon.

Page 29 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

61. I was not involved in formulating POL’s strategy in responding to the
Shoosmiths litigation and I cannot remember being informed of it other than
as seen in the email from Mike Granville (Head of Regulation Strategy) dated
26 November 2010, POL00120561, which states, in respect of legal cases
relating to individual SPMs being prosecuted for theft / false accounting, “our
approach throughout has been to robustly defend the integrity of the Horizon
system.” The email concerns Mike Granville asking for views on a statement
that he intends to send to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
(“BIS”) on Horizon issues. I think that I had only just started my role as
Network Sales Director when this email was sent and cannot remember

having any further involvement.

62. On 20 October 2011, the business received instructions from Legal,
POL00176465, in respect of document creation, including around legal
privilege -. Angela Van Den Bogerd and Sue Huggins were recipients of this
email and it was their teams within the Network to whom the instructions in
this email were applicable, so my assumption is that they would have followed
these instructions and forwarded the email onto their teams. I would not have
questioned these instructions and I do not believe any of my team would have
either would have either as none of us are legally trained. As I was not
involved in the litigation, I do not feel it is for me to say whether those
instructions that we received were driven by POL trying to prevent the
disclosure of documents so that it could prejudice its position in relation to

Horizon.

Page 30 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

63. I have been asked to consider POL00294896 (email from Rod Ismay to Paul
Meadows and others on 14 October 2011) and attachment POL00294897
(Request for Delegated Authority as regards costs of Legal Action 14 October

2011).

64. From reading the email and its attachment, Rod Ismay has drafted a proposal
around the legal action and subsequent legal costs in defence of challenges
made by Shoosmiths. All projects needed to have an Executive Sponsor and
Rod has referenced that he is going to have a call with me to discuss my
thoughts on sponsoring it. I cannot remember having such a call and to the
best of my recollection, I never sponsored this project or any similar one. My
name is shown in square brackets in the proposal and my assumption is that
it is a draft. I have not been disclosed a final version of the proposal from the
Inquiry and so am unable to comment on if this ever went ahead and, if so,

who sponsored it.

65. I was not a Board member and therefore am unable to comment on what
steps any Board members took in relation to the Private Eye Article about the
Horizon issue other than what is referenced in the disclosure - POL00338392
(email from Mike Granville to me on 21 September 2011), POL00363235_050
(email from David Simpson copied to me on 12 October 2011) and

POL00294969 (email from Paula Vennells copied to me on 27 October 2011).

Page 31 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

66. I have been asked to describe my views as to any steps taken within POL as
at late 2011/early 2012 regarding the potential of litigation against POL from
SPMs. Legal was completely outside of my area of expertise and so I do not
feel able to comment on the approach but personally, I would follow their
instructions and I thought that it was sensible that Royal Mail Group were
taking a lawyer led approach in light of the potential litigation. From memory,
after litigation was threatened, I believe all correspondence on Horizon was to
have oversight by Royal Mail Group and POL Legal so that there was a
coordinated response and teams started to be contacted by Legal to collect
relevant documents. I also think Mike Granville may have been a point of
contact within POL with regard to the potential litigation although I can’t be

sure.

67. The Inquiry have asked me about POL00378468 (email from Eunice Kirby
forwarding emails between me, Rod Ismay and Mike Granville dated 18
March 2011). From recollection, as mentioned in the paragraph above, we
may have been asked to notify Mike if we received any information which was
relevant or potentially relevant to the litigation. I therefore wrote to him,
flagging a case which demonstrated that the process for inputting transactions
was complicated which could lead to SPMs making errors, as had happened
in this situation. Although I cannot remember, from reading the email, the
complaint had been dealt with but I forwarded it to Mike as I thought that it
was an example of where our processes needed to be improved, and for
which we could be criticised. I do not know what TV reports I am referring to.

Cases such as these strengthened my belief that there was not an issue with

Page 32 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

Horizon’s integrity, but the issues stemmed from the fact it could sometimes

be difficult to use, resulting in human error.

68. The Inquiry have asked me to provide my reflections on the learnings shared
by Angela Van Den Bogerd and Dave Pardoe on past cases, including
Ferndown, as noted in POL00294869 (memo from Rod Ismay to me and
others on 12 October 2011). My reading of the document is that it does not
say what the learnings are, but merely says that Dave and Angela would
deliver key learnings at the first Steering Group meeting. I was not at the
meeting and do not know what these learnings were. In fact, I do not know if
this proposed Steering Group was ever established and I have no documents

to show what happened next.

MONITORING OF HORIZON

69. In answering the Inquiry’s questions on this subject, I have reviewed the

following documents:

a. POL00030217 (E&Y Management letter for the year ending 27 March
2011)

b. POL00294829 (Terms of Reference from Stephen A Collins sent to me
and others on 5 August 2011)

c. POL00294906 (Email from Paula Vennells on 20 October 2011)

d. POL00029114 (POL Draft Review of Key System Controls in Horizon

. POL00162189 (Email chain dated 3 June 2014)

70. I had very limited knowledge of Horizon from a technical perspective as my

knowledge of it was from a business perspective. I therefore do not recall the

full extent of what systems were in place for testing, monitoring and auditing

Horizon, other than to believe that it was tested and monitored and that there

were both internal and external audits. As shown by the documents above, I

was on the circulation list for emails concerning Horizon’s monitoring,

42349433.1

Page 34 of 109
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

although these were of a technical nature. If anything important was of note, I
would have expected this to have been picked up by the IT team and flagged

to the senior team within POL.

71. The document POL00030217 shows me that in March 2011, POL
commissioned EY to have a look at POL’s internal systems and controls, in
order to have their accounts signed off . From memory this was an annual
review for the accounts to be signed. EY’s report covers Horizon (back end)
user administration. I have also been disclosed a Terms of Reference from
August 2011, POL00294829, which shows that POL carried out an internal
audit to review Horizon System Controls, which was being prepared in
contemplation of litigation. It would seem that was done in response to EY’s
report, following which POL implemented the recommended actions and
carried out its own internal audits to check outstanding actions against the
action plan (POL00029114 (February 2012), POL00030482 (March 2012),
POL00029713 (December 2012), POL00340338 (March 2013) and
POL00144659 and POL00380822 (May 2013)). Reports such as these would
have given me reassurance that Horizon was being reviewed and monitored

internally and externally.

72. The documents disclosed also show Board papers, including POL00129915,
a paper dated 1 May 2012 informing the Board of the action being taken to
identify the cause of four significant incidents in the branch network,
POL00114269, a POL Board Noting Paper on Horizon Evolution dated 19
September 2012, which provides an update on the findings and activities

Page 35 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

being taken in response to a KPMG Risk and Resilience report,
UKGI00018115, dated 1 September 2012. I was not a Board member and do
not recall if I would have received a copy of these papers or an update on

their content.

73. I can see at POL00294906, that on 20 October 2011 Paula Vennells has
emailed Lesley Sewell, copying me in, asking for confirmation at to the
robustness / reliability of Pintest. I do not recall what Pintest was but the
email shows me that I have flagged it might be something that the BBC are

picking up on.

74. On occasion, if it affected the operation of the network, I may have more
involvement in issues with Horizon. For example, on 6 May 2012, Dave
Hulbert writes to me updating me on a Disaster Recovery Test which was
being carried out, POL00339056. Dave was keeping me informed how the
test was going and notified me that whilst there had been, “no issues for
branches or customers — they’re not writing to the database correctly”. He
explained that to correct the problem he would need to cease the service to
branches 45 minutes earlier than scheduled to ensure that it did not impact on
the following days trading (the test was carried out on a Sunday because it
was the quietest trading day). I asked a number of questions about the
process involved and was provided reassurance as to the processes for

ensuring data integrity.

WITN10040100
WITN10040100

75. As shown at POL00339652 (email from Lesley Sewell to me dated 9
September 2012, I can also recall raising a complaint that I did not think
Fujitsu were adequately logging issues raised by SPMs, as one SPM was
having a repeat problem which Fujitsu were logging as a new issue every
time, meaning the SPM had to repeat their explanation of the issue every time
she called and there was a failure for Fujitsu to recognise it was an ongoing
issue. Another topic concerning Fujitsu’s support is noted in POL00184071,
the Network Transformation Board meeting minutes of 21 November 2012.
Part of the Network Transformation programme was about increasing the
opening hours of branches to meet customer demand and match what our
competitors were offering. We therefore needed to extend the hours of
Fujitsu’s support in line with this, and in order to establish how much support
was required, we were seeking to obtain data about what the branch demand
was for Fujitsu support outside core hours. In June 2014, there was a move of
the Horizon Service Desk from Fujitsu to Atos which involved a lot of prior
testing and monitoring before it was implemented. As shown in POL00162189
(email chain dated 3 June 2014), I was involved in this because of any

potential impact to the branch network .

76. I did not have any knowledge or involvement in relation to the preparation of
the EY Report. I cannot remember reading or discussing the EY report after it
came out, but this is not to say that I did not. As can be seen from the report,
it was technical and I believe that I would have relied on the Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Operating Officer to explain the report and any business
implications. As noted above, following the report, POL carried out its own

Page 37 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

internal review followed by internal audits to monitor the outstanding actions
and I think I would have taken comfort from the fact POL had commissioned
an external report and were taking action following its recommendations.
Terms of Reference for this internal review dated 5 August 2011 at

POL00294829.

77. The Inquiry have asked me about POL00143600, an email chain dated 9
September 2012. This is linked to POL00339652, another email chain from
the same date which I have mentioned above. From my recollection, a SPM
had got in contact with me because she was having problems with a Horizon
terminal at outreach locations. This was where Horizon was set up in
locations where there was not a Post Office, such as a village hall. The SPM
was having ongoing issues which she would raise with Fujitsu, who would get
the service up and running again and then close the call log. When she rang
them again, they would not have any record of her previous calls meaning she
had to explain the problem again and Fujitsu were not recognising the length
of time this was going on and therefore they were not getting to the root of the
issue or registering the true length of time the problem had been going on for.
The problem ultimately turned out to be a faulty cable. As shown in
POL00143600, I reported this issue back to Lesley Sewell, who in turn

reported it to Dave Hulbert stating:

“When I met with Kevin his concern was more broad — he is worried that

because the issues at the branches get raised and then closed that we’re not

Page 38 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

seeing the bigger picture. And that we may have something systemic that we

can't see.”

78. Here, Lesley is passing on my comments of frustration that Fujitsu do not
have good case management where call logs are logged together, meaning
the way they log calls stops them from seeing the full picture and get to the

root of the issue in a more effective and efficient way.

ENGAGEMENT WITH MPS IN 2012

79. On 15 December 2011, Lord Arbuthnot sent a letter to Moya Greene (CEO of
POL) about software issues at Odiham Post Office in Hampshire to which I

respond on 12 January 2012 (both letters at POL00105483).

80. When correspondence from MPs came in, it would be dealt with by the
Executive Correspondence team who would gather all of the background
information from the relevant teams within POL and then produce a draft letter
with a background sheet as to what, why and how the situation had arisen,
why our response is what it was and any other relevant information. A copy of
the background sheet which would have accompanied this letter has not been
disclosed. My normal course of action would be to read the draft letter and the
background sheet, gone back to the Executive Correspondence team with
any questions and, when satisfied, signed the letter for sending. I cannot say
for definite but it is possible that Legal would also have had input due to the

threat of litigation from Shoosmiths / Legal Action.

Page 39 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

81. I would have satisfied myself that the content of the letter was accurate based
both on the background sheet provided and what I believed to be true about
the reliability of Horizon at the time, from the internal messaging within POL.
Horizon was very in focus at the time because of the proposed litigation and
therefore whilst I may have asked questions around the specific
circumstances of the branch, it is unlikely that I would have asked general
questions in terms of Horizon’s robustness because this had been closely
monitored within POL and we had standard messaging as produced by the

Communications team.

82. From what I recall, the Executive Correspondence team were responsible for
preparing POL’s response to any concerns raised by MPs during 2012. I
would become involved on an ad hoc basis, to the extent that the issue was
relevant to my team and my input was required. Although the Executive
Correspondence team would draft these letters, I would always check those
that required my involvement and make amendments as I saw fit. As can be
seen in POL00096780, the email correspondence between Alice Perkins and
myself on 8 July 2012, with Paula Vennell’s response at POL00096804,
where Alice had asked for my input regarding the operation of the new ‘locals’

branch model.

83. From what I recall, I did not attend any meetings with MPs during 2012 or at
anytime relating to Horizon, but I was sometimes informed of them, as is seen
in the email chain dated 20 April 2012, POL00105494. I might be given action

Page 40 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

points that arose from such meetings if the action fell within my responsibility.
For example, POL00105481 is the notes of a meeting attended by Lord
Arbuthnot, Alice Perkins and Alwen Lyons on 13 March 2012. Whilst I did not
attend this meeting, I can see that I was given two action points to complete
ahead of the next meeting on 28 March, including putting together a brief
covering the facts about the issues that Lord Arbuthnot raised and finding out
what POL could show Lord Arbuthnot about balancing and how SPMs can
check their accounts during balancing if he was invited into the model office.
Similarly, in POL00417089, an email chain from Mike Whitehead to Peter
Batten dated 18 June 2012, I have been given two action points concerning
NFSP and CWU as I was responsible for these stakeholder relationships

(discussed in further detail below).

84. In POL00142984, an email chain dated 18 April 2012 , Paula Vennells asks
me for history on correspondence concerning Yetminster Post Office, which I
forward to Sue Huggins and Mike Granville to provide the background.
Similarly, in POL00105490, an email chain dated 22 May 2012, although I am
not copied in, it is referenced that I will look into questions from Sir Paul
Beresford. Although I do not recall what these questions were, it was not
uncommon for questions to be put to me, not because I was close to the detail
but because my position as Network and Sales Director meant that I was well

connected to those who would know the detail and I knew who to ask.

85. The Inquiry has asked about my understanding of any steps taken by POL to

notify BIS regarding Horizon issues, with reference to POL00180807. This is

Page 41 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

an email chain dated 22 June 2012 between Paula Vennells and Mike
Granville to which I am copied in. Although I held monthly meetings with BIS,
this was to update them on the progress of Network and Crown
Transformation and I never spoke to them about Justice For SPM’s Alliance
(“JFSA”) or Horizon. I am therefore unable to provide any further details on
how they were notified about Horizon issues beyond what is contained in this

email.

RELATIONSHIP WITH NFSP

86. Prior to 2004, I would only occasionally engage with NFSP within the various
head office roles I held to discuss any changes or developments to the
products and services that I was responsible for. However, in 2004, as Head
of Franchise Relationships, I became responsible for POL’s relationship with
NFSP. This responsibility briefly stopped in 2006 — 2007 when I moved to
General Manager Multiples but I picked up responsibility for the NFSP again
from 2007 — 2009 as Head of Agency Development. In November 2010, I
became Network and Sales Director at which point I had oversight of the
relationship but my relationship became more strategic, with day to day issues
being handled by members of my team and my contact with the NFSP
primarily relating to the Network Transformation programme and the future of
the branch network. From 2014 — 2016 the responsibility for the NFSP was
transferred to Neil Hayward, the new HR Director. It was during this period
that the Grant Agreement was negotiated and agreed. From 2017 until I left

POL the relationship sat within my business unit.

Page 42 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

87. Being responsible for the relationship with NFSP meant coordinating between
them and the different teams within POL, keeping NFSP updated on any
matters which would affect SPMs and negotiating SPMs annual remuneration
increases. NFSP were the recognised representative body for SPMs and they
were a good vehicle for two way communications. I would say that I had a
good professional working relationship with George Thomson (General
Secretary of NFSP), the negotiating committee, executive and the branch
officials that I had dealings with. Although I found them to be demanding and
challenging, they were supportive of the Network Transformation and I believe
that we shared a common goal of wanting success for the branch network and
to avoid branch closures as had been seen in the past. It was important that
we had a positive relationship with them and had their support with Network
Transformation because we were working with them to shape the programme
and it was going to be such a big change as I have highlighted at POL11/47

within the Board meeting minutes of 22 September 2011, POL00030365.

88. As I was responsible for POL’s relationship with NFSP, I would often be
forwarded any communication or information that was relevant to them such
as POL00294748, the email sent by Mike Granville on 2 February 2011
informing me that NFSP was supportive on Horizon, in response to the BBC
programme . George Thomson would keep me updated of any relevant
information, as he did on 12 July 2013 where he has forwarded on an email
from a dissatisfied SPM, POL00372043. George also had good connections
within POL and so would often email the relevant person direct but keep me

Page 43 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

copied in for information purposes, as he has on 20 December 2012 in
respect of a letter received from Alan Bates at POL00296010 and
POL00296011. I do not think that I would have responded to either of these

emails.

89. In 2014, the responsibility for the NFSP transferred to Neil Hayward (Group
People Director). It was during this time, that the Grant Agreement was
developed and agreed which created a difficult relationship between POL and
NFSP. I would still assist as and when required, as noted in the action that
Paula Vennells has given me in her email of 15 August 2014, POL00348119.
As seen in the email from Nick Beal to me on 17 January 2014,
POL00150720, as the negotiations over the Grant Agreement occurred, other
issues were brought to the table such as the Cliff and Network Extension as
negotiation tools. As these were both my areas of responsibility, I was kept
updated. Because of this involvement and due to my seniority, I also attended
the annual NFSP conference on 11 May 2015,, which discussed the Grant
Agreement. POL00151913 are the NFSP conference papers dated 11 May

2015.

90. From December 2016 until I left POL, responsibility for the relationship with
the NFSP was transferred back to me, as seen in the Group Executive
Agenda of 14 September 2017, POL00027276. In the main, I felt that POL

had a positive but challenging relationship with NFSP.

Page 44 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

91. In the early days of my involvement with the NFSP, members of my team and
I would meet Colin Baker (General Secretary or the NFSP prior to George
Thomson) and subsequently George and their negotiating team to discuss or
negotiate and agree any changes that were happening within POL. A large
part of my role was to negotiate and agree remuneration rates and changes to

products and services particularly the annual remuneration negotiation.

92. Occasionally, I would be invited to the national executive council to discuss
matters that would have an impact on NFSP members, such as before the roll
out of the Network Transformation Programme (NFSP00000454 — NFSP
report of a meeting of the National Executive Council on 10 — 12 October
2011). I can recall Michael Larkin (Head of Agency Sales) and myself
attending the National Executive Council meeting in 2010 to explain the new
field support structure and what it would mean for SPMs but I don’t recall

attending many of these meetings.

93. From time to time, I would also attend local branch meetings, either through a
planned series of events or ad hoc meetings where I had been invited. If I was
asked to present on a chosen topic I would always allow time at the end for
questions about wider business issues which was a useful way of getting

firsthand feedback.

94. In my role of Network and Sales Director, I would have regular meetings with
George Thomson. These would be ad-hoc, as and when matters needed to
be discussed. George also had a quarterly one to one meeting with Paula

Page 45 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

Vennells that I would attend. As the Network Transformation was happening,
we worked very closely with the NFSP to make sure that they were kept fully
informed of what was happened and we worked closely with them to shape

the programme.

95. Colin Baker and later George Thomson, had good access to all parts of the
business and George, in particular, had contacts at the most senior levels of
the business, meaning it wasn’t just me and my team who were having
contact with them. Whilst I would facilitate meetings and access for the NFSP
to all parts of POL where required, for any complex or technical issues which
were specific to an area of the business, these would be dealt with by the

subject matter expert within POL.

96. POL would also support the NFSP annual conference with stands and
presentations and there would usually be a government minister and Paula
Vennells speaking so that material matters could be discussed and voted on
and so that the NFSP had the chance to ask questions direct to the

government and POL CEO.

97. When the SS review was published in June 2012, NFSP started to receive a
number of complaints from SPMs and ex-SPMs about Horizon which were
forwarded on to POL. George Thomson was very annoyed that SS had been
commissioned and he emailed Paula Vennells on 22 June saying that 6 or 7
people had contacted NFSP in the last 2 days and asking why his views were
not sought prior to POL commissioning a review of Horizon, POL00295389.

Page 46 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

98. There continued to be multiple complaints to NFSP in the following days
which were forwarded to myself either direct or in copy as shown in
POL00295392, POL00295393, POL00295394, all being emails from George
Thompson to me and Paula Vennells dated 26 June 2012. These were

forwarded to me because I was responsible for the relationship with NFSP.

99. I cannot remember specifically dealing with any complaints from the NFSP.
about the integrity of Horizon. As I’ve explained above, the NFSP had a good
network of contacts in POL and any complaints could have been raised
directly with the appropriate people or departments for example, Angela Van
Den Bogerd, for issues with training and support, IT for issues relating to
Horizon, or even with Paula Vennells. I know that POL’s Communications
team also had good links with the NFSP and so would often deal with them
direct in respect of complaints, although my team may have facilitated this

communication.

100. Again, I do not recall specifically, but it is clear from POL00295395 (email
chain dated 27 June 2012) that I spoke to George Thomson and wanted to
put in place a process to pick up any future complaints as the number had
risen following the publication of SS’s report. I think that after this point, all
complaints were sent direct to Angela Van Den Bogerd, Craig Tuthill and
Susan Crichton to deal with centrally. I think that POL’s Communication team
were also in touch with NFSP to share any briefings that they had on the
integrity of Horizon but I cannot say for sure. I can also see from

Page 47 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

POL00105607 (email from me to Dave Hulbert dated 5 July 2012) that
George was taken down to Fujitsu to talk through some incidents but I don’t
know what these incidents are. I do not think that I had any involvement with

this meeting although my team may have facilitated it.

10

-POL00152168 is an email from me to Mark Davies dated 14 June 2015 in
which I say “if we could get George making a positive public response it would
be v helpful”. My email is in response to Mark Davies, who has emailed the
Field Team who I was responsible for, as well as me, saying that Panorama is
planning a piece on Post Office and Horizon. Mark outlines his preferred
approach and asks for our input and help in executing this approach. I
respond that it would be helpful for George to make a positive public response
about Horizon because I thought this would provide reassurance to SPMs if
they saw that their representative body was supportive of Horizon, which is
what I understood the NFSP’s position to be at that time. I was prompted to
make the comment about George after Nick Beale (who was responsible for
the day to day relationship with the NFSP) was asking Mark to meet, about

briefing George.

102.POL00372043 is an email from SPM Richard Blackshaw to George Thomson,
forwarded to myself and others, dated 12 July 2013. I cannot recall my
reaction upon reading it and cannot recall if any response was made. Reading
it now, it is a highly emotive email and I am sure I would have thought the

same at the time.

SECOND SIGHT

103.1 was not personally involved but from memory, I believe that Alice Perkins
(Chair) and maybe Paula Vennells (CEO) were responsible for the
appointment of SS. However, I think it was Susan Crichton (General Counsel)

who suggested SS because she had worked with them before.

104. Again, I had no involvement in the ambit of SS’s investigation and I cannot
say for sure, but my recollection was that it was agreed between Paula
Vennells and Alice Perkins, in discussion with Lord James Arbuthnot and

Susan Crichton.

105.1 was not involved in and do not know what access SS had to information or

relevant documents and therefore do not feel able to comment on this.

106.1 have reviewed POL00021508 (POL Board Meeting Minutes 4 July 2012),
POL00167447 (POL Board Meeting Minutes 24 June 2013) and
POL00358173 (the statement that POL issued following the publication of SS
Interim Report, dated 8 July 2013). I do not recall these meetings and was not
involved in the drafting of the statement and so do not feel able to add
anything beyond what is contained in the documents. I have, however, noted

that the Board Meeting Minutes of 24 June 2014 state:

“The CEO explained that although the SS report had been challenging it had

highlighted some positive things as well as improvement opportunities. The

Page 49 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

business had been praised in Parliament for setting up the independent
review; the proportionality of the tiny number of cases had been emphasised;
and no systemic issues had been found with the Horizon computer system.
However there were cultural issues which had to be addressed to improve the

support we gave to SPMS.”

107.1 understand that this was the first time that the Board met to discuss to the
SS Interim Report and therefore it is my assumption that Paula Vennells
message was a reflection of the Board’s view of the Interim Report. However,
I cannot comment on how other senior executives within POL viewed SS and
the purpose of its investigation as I had little involvement with it. Personally, I
believed that Horizon was robust but recognised the benefits of an
independent review as there were people saying something was wrong and

so I thought the decision to appoint SS was sensible.

108.1 was not involved in POL’s response to requests for information from SS and

/ or investigations into the integrity of Horizon and so do not feel able to

comment on it.

THE INTERIM REPORT AND MEDIATION SCHEME

109. The below deals with my involvement in POL’s preparation for and response

to SS’s reports, the Branch Support Programme and the Mediation Scheme.

Page 50 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

Involvement in preparation for and response to Second Sight’s reports

110.1 was not involved with POL’s preparation for, or response to, SS’s Reports
other than to provide my input as and when requested. For example, an email
chain from 16 July 2013, POL00192104, states that as part of POL’s
response to the SS Interim Report, a regular conference call will be set up to
enable any identified issues with Horizon to be shared with business units
who use and rely on the system. A representative is required from multiple
areas of the business, including Network, with the email chain showing that I
have nominated Nick Beal as an appropriate representative to Crowns,

Agency, Multiples and Partners.

111.As a member of ExCo, I would have been updated with what was happening
in response to SS's Interim Report but would not have been involved in
formulating this response. For example, POL00207756 (email from Belinda
Crowe to me and others dated 21 August 2014 and attachment
POL00207757 (Second Sight Briefing Report — Part Two) and POL00101299

(email from Mark Davies to me and others dated 5 September 2014)

112.1 have reviewed POL00190338 which is an email dated 3 July 2013 from
Martin Edwards (Paula Vennells’ Chief of Staff) to myself and other senior
employees attaching a briefing note on the SS Interim Report, POL00190341.

Martin’s email states that the headline point to note is that

Page 51 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

“to date, no systemic issues have been identified in the Horizon system itself
through this process. However, we expect SS will draw attention to areas for
improvement in our wider support system (e.g. the guidance and training

provided to smprs).”

113.The Inquiry have asked whether I consider the phrase “systemic issues” to be
a concept that is distinguished from the description of “system exceptions”.
My interpretation is that they are distinguished, in that if something has
systemic issues it is fundamentally flawed, whereas if something has system
exceptions (or anomalies as referred to in the Briefing Paper), then it might be
an issue which requires rectification but does not necessarily mean that it is
an issue which undermines the overall integrity of the system. In this context,
the fact that we were told that Horizon had no systemic issues but some
system anomalies, to me meant there were some bugs which required

attention but did not undermine its overall integrity.

114.1 was not involved in any decision making relating to the ambit of SS’s
investigation or the extent of its access to relevant information and

documents.

115.Both Martin’s email POL00190338, and the Briefing paper, POL00190341,
both dated 3 July 2013, reference a meeting that Alice Perkins, Paula
Vennells and Alwen Lyons had with Lord James Arbuthnot on 3 July 2013. I

do not believe that I had any involvement in preparing for this meeting.

Page 52 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

116.1 do not believe that I was involved in liaising with any MPs in relation to
matters arising from the interim SS report, or in any communications /
stakeholder plans to manage the potential scenarios following the publication
of the Report. There was a specific team who dealt with this and I was given

updates as a member of the ExCo.

117.In an email dated 10 July 2013, POL00341624, George Thompson forwards
an email from a Dispute Resolution firm which has contacted the NFSP,
asking if George wants legal advice, having read “detail of the computer
system fall out”, to Paula Vennells, Susan Barton, Nick Beal, Mike Whitehead

and myself . In forwarding the email, George comments:

“This is the type of mess we have created with the Horizon debacle. Our

tactics were totally misguided.”

118.1 do not know what tactics Mr Thomson is referring to, but it could be a
reference to POL’s decision to conduct an independent review into Horizon,
which Mr Thomson previously expressed annoyance about, as shown in

POL00295389, the email chain dated 25 June 2012..

Involvement in Initial Complaint and Mediation Scheme

119.1 had no involvement in the Initial Complaint and Mediation Scheme but as

part of ExCo, I would have received regular updates on its progress.

Page 53 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

120.In addition to the documents referenced within the body of my answers below,

I have reviewed the following:

a. POL00029663 (email chain between Paula Vennells, Lesley Sewell and
myself dated 15 July 2013) — the email starts with Paula disclosing a
confidential case study, which she has been allowed to share to help POL
plan what to do to correct the issues raised in the SS review. The case raises
a number of issues for Susan Crichton and myself to look at, covering issues
such as “tone of voice, help not available, escalation impossible, Network and
Legal blocking any ability to discuss, contract questions etc.” These issues all
highlight shortcomings which made SPMs lives operationally more difficult.
This demonstrates my involvement in individual cases within the Scheme
where they concerned operational issues so that I was aware of them and
could then enable improvements to be put in place

b. POL00298435 (emails between SPM Pervez Nakvi, dated 21 August 2013) —
Paula Vennells has blind copied me into an email responding to a SPM who
she knows well, asking for Angela Van Den Bogerd or one of her team to be
in touch. I am likely copied in for general awareness, in case my involvement
was needed at a later date, given that Paula knew the SPM personally. Again,
this is an example of where I might be copied into correspondence for the
higher profile or more complex cases.

c. POL00099702 (email chain dated 4 October 2013) — Paula Vennells has
forwarded a spreadsheet of ‘thematic issues’ of cases likely to go into the

mediation process. She has shared with this the whole ExCo team, firstly to

Page 54 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

make us aware and secondly, to think about how we share the information
and take learnings from it.

d. POL00294482 (email from Gayle Peacock to me and others dated 30 July
2014) and attachment POL00294483 (Branch Support Programme — Work
Stream meeting papers dated 31 July 2014). This refers to a Workstream
meeting which I would not have attended. I did, however, chair the Branch

Support Programme Steering group meetings.

121.The Inquiry have asked me to consider POL00040032, a document entitled
“Lessons Learned” Review of handling of alleged issues/concerns about
Horizon: Terms of Reference’ dated 30 August 2013. The document lists
myself as one of the people who will be interviewed in relation to an internal
POL review of the way in which Horizon complaints were handled in the

period before the SS Interim Report.

122.I have no recollection of attending any such interview or being asked to attend
any such interview and I do not recall seeing any report which covered the

scope as set out in this document.

123.On 27 November 2013, the Board agreed that it would be appropriate to
consider the future approach to prosecutions (POL00021520 — Meeting
Minutes: Board meeting minutes for meeting held on 27 November 2013). I
cannot remember exactly and the Board papers do not assist me, however,
the Prosecutions Policy paper, POL00100193, shows that at an ARC meeting

on 19 November 2013:

Page 55 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

“the Committee considered whether or not there was merit in formally
amending the existing approach to prosecutions and if so what the substance

of these amendments should be”.

124.I am assuming that as a result of this it was discussed at the Board. I was not
a member of the ARC or the Board and I cannot remember what approach
was approved but from my recollection, the prosecutions remained
suspended. I think that the trigger for the policy review was because of the

publication of SS’s report, but I cannot say for sure.

125. Although I was not involved in the reasoning behind the changes made to the
policy, I can see from the email chain of 5 February 2014, POL00130502, that
Neil Hayward, Chris Day and I were asked to sign off a note on the
prosecution policy dated 4 February 2014, POL00100193. The email chain
shows that I am largely supportive of the policy but have a few observations /

questions arising from the ‘Commercial Impact / Costs’ section of the note.

126.On 11 February 2014, the ARC Sub-Committee held a meeting based off the
note of 4 February 2014, POL00100193, the purpose of which was to seek
the ARC’s views on the proposed changes to the prosecution policy and the
way in which POL will prosecute criminal cases in the future. I am not listed as
an attendee at this meeting and do not feel able to add anything beyond what

is contained in the meeting notes, POL00030900, dated 7 February 2014.

Page 56 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

127.During the entirety of my employment at POL, I never thought that there was
a risk that POL had inappropriately prosecuted SPMs and never thought or
had reason to believe that anyone else in POL thought this either. I can see
from the documents disclosed, that in multiple ExCo meetings, including: 16
September 2014, POL00306425; 16 October 2014, POL00149190; 13
November 2014, POL00038819; and 15 January 2015, POL00109859 that

we received the same update in respect of criminal litigation as follows:

“There are a number of cases which could have been prosecuted...but
prosecutions were not commenced to avoid adverse judicial comment.
Several cases have also been terminated while POL obtains an independent
expert report on the Horizon branch accounting system...There are currently
14 cases being kept under review as to whether a prosecution (supported by

an expert report) can be commenced.”

128.My recollection is vague and I cannot recall the chronological order of events
but from memory, prosecutions stopped from late 2013 and my belief was that
this was because of SS’s report. However, I cannot remember any specific

details around this and I was never directly involved.

129.1 was not directly involved in the Mediation Scheme but I understood that any
complaints that were made about Horizon were being investigated and
process improvements were developed where there were shortcomings. For
training and support issues, improvements were developed and implemented

by the Branch Support Programme.

WITN10040100
WITN10040100

130.When the Scheme was first set up, a process was put in place to centralise all

complaints as referenced in POL00145553 (emails between Matt Baker of
CWU, Angela Van Den Bogerd and myself dated 18 July 2013). This email
chain concerns a SPM who is experiencing problems with losses which he
believed was because the new security alarm system which had been
installed was sharing the same communication line as Horizon. I have
forwarded it on to Susan Crichton and Nick Beal, copying in Angela Van Den
Bogerd, asking whether there is now a process for handling these. Angela
confirms that there is now a process for logging and acknowledging the case
although the second part of the process, how to work with the SPM to get to

the bottom of the issue, needs to be reviewed.

131.From reviewing the papers disclosed, the process for suspension and
termination changed around July 2013 as noted in POL00145530 (email
chain dated 17 July 2013) and POL00327004 (email chain dated 17 July
2013). At the same time, the SPM Appeal Panel Process was reviewed as
shown in POL00125022 (email from John Breedon copied to me dated 12
July 2013), POL00125023 (SPM Appeal Panel Review Document) and

POL00341652 (SPM Appeal Panel Process Document)).

132.From memory, there was a case concerning a Scottish SPM, David Woodrow,
who was suspended because he retained £2,000 in lieu of a rates issue which
was exclusive to Scotland. This is noted in POL00099179 (Email chain

between SPM David Woodrow, Paula Vennells, myself and others, dated 12

Page 58 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

July 2013) and POL00116059 (associated SPM case summary) and
POL00145419 (associated email chain of the same date). Paula Vennells
forwarded the case to myself and Susan Crichton, asking us to take this
seriously and investigate as his suspension appeared to be overbearing and
disproportionate. I am asked to meet with Susan and Paula to discuss what
we can do about this and what we might need to think about to be able to
respond responsibly going forward. I cannot say for definite, but it could be
that as a consequence of this meeting, we reviewed the processes for

suspension and termination and appeal panel process.

133.From looking at the documents, we increased the threshold for suspensions
with no suspensions to take place if the amount of money in dispute was
below £2,000. We also created greater oversight, with any future suspension
requiring authorisation by either Lin Norbury or John Breedan. For all other
cases, they would be referred to one of the national contract managers who
would then speak to either Nick Beal, Michael Larkin, Angela Van Den Bogerd
or myself, so that we could start to get a better picture of what was taking

place to help us formulate new criteria.

Branch Support Programme

134.The SS Interim Report identified a number of weaknesses in the training and
support that was provided to SPMs and gave a number of associated
recommendations. The Branch Support Programme (later known as the

Branch Improvement Programme) was established to look into these

Page 59 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

weaknesses and implement the recommendations. As noted in the Terms of

Reference, POL00089711, dated 19 July 2013:

“The purpose of this Programme is to understand the current business
processes, operational procedures and ways of working which are in place to
support branches, identify the gaps and produce recommendations to rectify

the issues.”

135.The programme was underpinned by three guiding principles: 1. Treat with

dignity and respect at all times; 2. stand in SPMs shoes and 3. Right first time.

136.Paula Vennells asked Angela Van Den Bogerd to lead the programme and I
was asked to sponsor it as all programmes required an Executive sponsor. As
a sponsor, I was not involved in the day to day running of the programme but
it was my role to make sure that the programme was on course to fulfil its
purpose, had adequate resources and was delivered to time, cost and quality

objectives.

137.1 would be kept updated on the progress of the programme, as shown in a
POL00203724 (Network and Sales Lead Team Meeting on 2 May 2014) and
would have approved any business cases related to the programme as shown
in POL00369484 (Business Case for Branch Support Programme dated 9
May 2014 and POL00304377 (email from Angela Van Den Bogerd to me
dated 9 May 2014). As my role was to ensure that the Programme was
fulfilling its objective, I would occasionally send actions to Angela Van Den

Page 60 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

Bogerd to assess our progress. For example, at POL00312231 (email chain
dated 18 February 2015) I ask Angela to “consider how we should test the
contract managers engagement with sub postmasters to see if new approach

is working”.

138.The Branch Support Programme was later developed into the Branch
Improvement Programme, which had a wider scope, as detailed in the Terms
of Reference dated 4 February 2014, at POL00148920. I continued to be the
sponsor and Angela continued to be the Programme Director. As sponsor, I
would continue to receive updates on the programme as shown in the

140.1 was not involved in the Working Group which was established to monitor the
Mediation Scheme. My recollection is that this was given direction and
oversight by the Project Sparrow Sub-Committee. However, I would have

been aware of it and received updates on its operation as a member of ExCo.

141.1 cannot recall any specific discussions that I had with individuals in the ExCo
on the Mediation Scheme and SS Report, other than those shown in the ExCo

meeting papers:

142.Although I would not have been party to discussions, I was updated on
Project Sparrow. For example, I would have had sight of the Sparrow Lessons
Learned Paper dated 25 April 2014, POL00104259, and would have been
briefed on the Initial Complaints Review and Mediation Scheme: The Way
Forward, dated 3 June 2014, POL00205259. This paper noted the scheme
was taking far longer than expected and proposed three options for
consideration by Sparrow Sub-Committee as shown in POL00205260

(Sparrow Sub-Committee Scheme briefing dated 9 June 2014).

143.As I was on the ExCo, I received updates on Project Sparrow. For example,
on 11 December 2014, Alwyn Lyons alerting the ExCo that there would be a
parliamentary debate on the Mediation Scheme POL00027747 and on 14
January 2015, Mark Davies providing a general update on the Mediation

Scheme as shown in POL00150615 and attachment POL00150616

Page 64 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

(Mediation Scheme Summary dated 14 January 2015). Similarly, the
documents disclosed show that Mark emailed myself and other senior
colleagues on 22 January 2015 POL00027739 and 30 January 2015
POL00117078 to provide us with an update on Project Sparrow ahead of the
BIS Select Committee hearing. As Mark notes, these messages were to keep
me and others in the loop and I cannot recall any subsequent discussions

from them.

144.1 was not responsible for responding to, or assisting with the response to,
Freedom of Information requests in connection with Horizon or SS matters but
as a member of ExCo, I was updated when we received them, as can been
seen from me being notified of them on 2 October 2014 at POL00210081, 17
November 2014 at POL00349860, 27 March 2015 at POL00225651 and 27
April 2015 at POL00353617. I believe, these email notifications would have
been for information only and my assumption is that there was an internal

policy on how to respond to them.

145.I had no involvement in POL’s strategy in preparing responses to applications
made to the Mediation Scheme or in POL’s response to SS’s investigations,

including disclosure of documents to SS.

146.1 never had any concerns that I was not receiving accurate and / or complete
information regarding BEDs, remote access or the integrity of Horizon and I
never had any reason to think that others in POL were not, particularly those
responding to applications to the Mediation Scheme. I was reassured that the

Page 65 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

Scheme had the oversight of legal and IT specialists and I truly believed at the

time that the information POL had obtained was complete and accurate.

147.On 9 March 2015, Jane MacLeod (General Counsel) sent a message via
Alwyn Lyons that POL would be bringing the Working Group to a close and

giving notice of termination to SS, POL00352489.

148.Mark Davies sent an email, UKGI00003629, the following day, 10 March
2015, to the Board, copying in ExCo, with an executive summary of the
reasons for closing the Working Group . He states that POL has now
completed the investigations of all of the 136 cases admitted to the Mediation
Scheme and nothing has been found in any of the cases to suggest that
Horizon has not worked as it should. Having completed its investigation, POL
has decided to put forward for mediation, all cases remaining in the Scheme
except for those that have been subject to a previous Court ruling. Later that
day, an update from Jane Hill and Mark Davies is circulated confirming that
POL has made the public announcement that the Working Group is to close
with immediate effect and that JFSA, SS and MPs with a case in the Scheme
(or a particular interest in Post Office) have been separately informed
alongside the announcement UKGI00003691. Two days later, as shown in
POL00224273, Mark emailed me direct, providing another update on media
coverage and Sparrow, following the issue being raised by James Arbuthnot

MP in Prime Minister’s Questions.

Page 66 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

149.From my recollection and on review of the documents disclosed, the
Mediation Scheme was taking a lot longer than anticipated with JFSA and
SPMs unhappy that their expectations were not being met and POL not being
happy with some aspects of the quality of SS’s work. As POL had completed
its investigation into all cases, it therefore decided to mediate all cases apart

from those that had gone through the Courts.

150.In the same month, the Branch Support Programme was brought to an end
with resources removed. It was felt that following the wrapping up of the
scheme, all the necessary improvements were delivered or in place to be
delivered and transferred to the business as usual teams. A presentation on
the programme as provided for a Steering Group meeting in this month is at

POL00223299.

151.On 30 July 2014 I, along with other senior members, was sent minutes and
actions from the Risk and Committee meeting on 21 July 2014 -
POL00206989 with attachment POL00206990. P.5 of these minutes
references a Project Zebra, a report by Deloitte on the internal controls over
Horizon. Prior to reading these documents I could not recall Project Zebra and
I was not an attendee at this meeting. I do not recall having any involvement

and my awareness would have only been very peripheral.

THE DEATH OF MARTIN GRIFFITHS

152.1 was deeply shocked and saddened at the death of Martin Griffiths and owing
to the tragic nature of the incident, a lot of senior managers were notified and
involved. From memory, following the incident, Angela Van Den Bogerd took
the lead in keeping myself and others updated on Martin’s condition and
putting in place practical arrangements for the family, such as a temporary
SPM to keep the branch open and providing ongoing payment of
remuneration to Martin's family. There were a lot of unknowns at the
beginning and so Angela also assisted in answering any questions that Paula
had around the circumstances of Martin’s case as shown in POL00196100
(emails from Paula Vennells to Angela Van Den Bogerd and myself dated 12

October 2013).

153.Mark Davies took the lead on the media communications as can be seen in
the email chain of 24 September 2013, POL00116133. I maintained general
oversight as to what measures POL was putting in place to support the family
and kept Paula Vennells updated. As noted in my email of 30 September

2013, POL00300096, “our priority is to support the family in this difficult time”.

154.After Martin passed away, I telephoned Gina Griffiths (Martin’s wife) to offer
my sincere condolences on behalf of POL. POL00393539 is an email chain
between Paula Vennells, myself and others from 11 — 22 October 2013.
Within this email chain, Angela wrote explaining that Gina Griffiths had
contacted Glen Chester to enquire as to whether there was any death in

Page 68 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

services benefit or pension and he had confirmed that neither was available
“given the Spmr status and contract for services etc.” Following this, Fay
Healey (Chief HR Officer) is asked by Paula Vennells to look into a couple of
options for payment. Fay subsequently emails me on 22 October 2013,
copying in other senior members of the team, outlining a number of different
payment sources. She states “Having discussed all of this with Mark, Belinda,
Angela and Alwen our collective view is that we should not consider a

payment at this stage, happy to discuss the rationale in person”.

155. The Inquiry have asked to what extent I was satisfied with the response/plan
arising from this correspondence. I have not been sent any further disclosure
following Fay’s email but from what I recall, payment was made to Martin’s
family through the Network Transformation funds. No amount of money can
be satisfactory payment for a life, but I think that I was at least satisfied that
Angela had found a way for some payment to be made. From what I
remember, everyone at POL was truly devastated, as noted in Angela’s email

of 16 October 2013, POL00381972.

156. The Inquiry have asked me to consider POL00196407 and POL00196410
(email from Mark Davies to myself and other dated 16 October and
attachment). Mark’s email informs me and other that Alan Bates has
proactively contacted the local MP (Jo Swinson) with regard to Martin
Griffiths, with the attachment showing a copy of this correspondence. As a
result of this, Mark says that he would like to contact the MP and offer a

meeting about the case which he thinks would need to involve Angela, myself

Page 69 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

and possibly Paula. I don’t believe that I met with Jo Swinson MP in relation to
this matter and there are no further documents in my bundle to suggest what

happened following this email.

2014 AND 2015 MEDIA COVERAGE

157.During my time on ExCo, I regularly received internal updates from Mark
Davies on the media’s response to Horizon and related issues, such as
Project Sparrow and SS’ Report, as shown in the documents listed below:
a. POL00101340 — Email from me to Mark Davies dated 9 September
2014
b. POL00101353 — Email from Mark Davies copied to me dated 10
September 2014
c. POL00101632 — Email chain dated 5 December 2014
d. POL00101761 — Email from Mark Davies to me dated 9 December
2014
e. POL00385837 — Email from Mark Davies to me dated 12 December
2014
f. POL00308946 — Email from Mark Davies to me dated 17 December
2014
g. POL00101983 — Email from Mark Davies to me dated 14 January 2015

h. POL00102395 — Email from Mark Davies to me dated 12 April 2015

158. Occasionally, I would also receive emails from Paula Vennells providing an
update on important media matters, such as the parliamentary debate as

Page 70 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

shown in POL00116922 (email chain from Paula Vennells to me and others
dated 17 December 2014). These updates were to keep me and other senior
leaders informed on what was happening within the media but I did not have
any direct involvement with formulating POL’s response to media coverage.
The limits of my knowledge with what was happening within the media is
noted in POL00333392 (email from Paula Vennells to me and others dated 14
January 2015) where Paula Vennells notes “/ expect the Exec and SLT
colleagues are not so well briefed.” Although I received regular updates, I was

not close to the detail of what was happening.

159.On occasion, I would be specifically approached to provide my input. For
example, in an email dated 24 April 2015, POL00151835, Mark Davies drafts
a message to be sent out to the network from the leadership team which he
says is probably best pitched from me, given my position. Similarly, an email
from me dated 14 June 2015, POL00162429, shows Mark Davies running a
proposed approach in respect of Panorama past the senior leadership team
for our input. Although my input might be sought on tone and audience, I was

never involved in drafting the actual content.

160.Separately, I was involved in a BBC Programme called “signed, sealed,
delivered” which aired in July 2015 and is referenced in the email from Paula
Vennells on 30 July 2015, UKGI00005157. This was not to do with Horizon,
but was a fly on the wall documentary, about every day life in the Post Office
and was seeking to underline the imperative for change that was happening

within the business.

Page 71 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

161.1 was not involved in developing the strategy or content of internal
communications relating to the Horizon IT system content. However, I would
be asked from to time to send out communications to my teams on the
subject. Draft communications would be sent to me asking for my approval

and where necessary sent out on my behalf.

162. In terms of internal communications regarding challenges to Horizon, every
day there would be the Daily Digest which summarised internal news. This
would be on all internal communications, not just Horizon. For example, the
Daily Digest from 10 September 2014, POL00158683, provides internal
communications on the leaking of the SS Report, as well as an industry news

summary.

163.1 did not have sight of any policies in respect of internal communications on
Horizon, but I can see that Mark Davies has said in his email of 14 June 2015
that his aim is to “make sure we reach the front line with reassurance and
information”. This approach is in line with my understanding that POL’s
intention was to inform and reassure people about Horizon, based on what

they believed at the time to be true.

164.1 was not on the Board and so am unable to comment on their views as to the

media reporting, beyond what is contained in the email correspondence.

Page 72 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

165.1 have considered POL00387685 (email from Paula Vennells to me dated 23

May 2015). Within this email chain I write:

“I’m sure the noise will increase as we implement the cliff and announce the

first few crown closures/mergers next month”.

166.My comment was in response to Mark Davies, who flagged a newspaper
article that contained negative and inaccurate comments about the Network
Transformation. My response was because I thought we might face similar
media articles in the future as we would be shortly announcing more Crown
office franchising mergers and what was know as the ‘Cliff, where any
branches which had not yet converted under the Network Transformation
programme, would be given notice to either convert to one of the new models,
close with 26 months remuneration or be moved onto variable pay. The
concept of Cliff was driven by the fact funding for Network Transformation
could not be guaranteed after a certain date and there was desire to complete
the modernisation process to help POL become more competitive and have a
more sustainable network. I can recall that despite my thoughts that Cliff may
attract a lot of media attention and hence my comment to Mark, in actual fact

it did not attract as much attention as I had anticipated.

POL’s RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS FROM 2014 ONWARDS

167.From 2014 onwards I was Network and Sales Director, and then CEO Retail
(2017).
Page 73 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

168.As referenced above, SPMs might raise concerns about Horizon by writing
direct to POL and when the litigation started, there was a process in place to

deal with all of the complaints.

169.As referenced above, on a regular basis I would visit branches to meet staff
and SPMs to get their feedback and answer any questions or issues they may
have and gain first hand experience of day to day life in post offices and
SPMs experience. This meant that occasionally a SPM might be in personal
touch with me as shown in the email chain dated 21 November 2014,
POL00308162, and attachment POL00308163 (Spreadsheet of Copy of 311
of Concurrence Report dated 20 November 2014). Similarly, because of my
seniority, a SPM might send correspondence direct to me so that I was aware
of a complaint, as SPM lan Straughan did in his email Of 21 July 2015,
POL00152655, and later 21 September 2015, POL00233039. As referenced
above, I would also occasionally attend NFSP local branch meetings where

SPMs would have the opportunity to feedback any concerns

170. If I received any complaint direct from a SPM, I would forward it to the
appropriate team within POL to investigate. For example, POL00344065 is an
email chain regarding Histon Post Office, dated 17 — 22 January 2014. The
email chain starts with an email from me to Dave Hulbert (Head of IT
Services) and Nick Beal (Head of Network Development) forwarding a text
message from a SPM asking if he can claim any money for his branch being
down for longer than 48 hours. I would often provide my phone number to

Page 74 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

SPMs so that they could contact me if needed and this is an example of such
contact happening, with me taking action to forward his issue to the people
best placed within POL to help. Dave Hulbert subsequently responds saying
that he will look into the issue with Fujitsu. I can recall this complaint as it was
particularly frustrating because it led to an argument between BT and Fujitsu
as to where the problem lay, with neither fixing the issue but with the SPM
being caught in the middle, extremely upset because they were unable to
trade. I ask for this to be urgently looked into, with the email showing that I
have spoken direct to the SPM and I want her to be fully compensated. I am
subsequently taken out of the email chain with the problem being taken

forward by Nick Beal and Dave Hulbert.

171.Due to my role as Network and Sales Director, I was often copied into
complaints to keep me in the loop, although my direct involvement was not

needed, as with the email chain dated 19 January 2015, POL00102042.

172.From 2013 - 2015 the Branch Support Programme was also in operation, for
which I was the Executive Sponsor. This is discussed in further detail above
but one of my roles as a sponsor was to oversee the costs. An email from me
to Angela Van Den Bogerd dated 27 November 2014, POL00350031, shows
Angela asking me to approve a business case asking for funding which would
automate a manual transaction around cheques, helping to prevent human
error. This is a good example of the programme putting in place practical
measures to assist SPMs when complaints were raised over the practical
operation of Horizon. Because Angela was in charge of the day to day running

Page 75 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

of the Business Support Programme, I would also usually direct SPM
complaints on Horizon to her to deal with as shown in POL00308241 (email
from Angela Van Den Bogerd dated 28 November 2014), POL00150177
(email from Paula Vennells copied to me dated 14 December 2014) and
POL00314060 (email from Angela Van Den Bogerd dated 1 April 2015) and if
I received feedback on an issue then I would feed this back to her to look into.
For example, in April 2015 I emailed Angela, POL00353200, to let her know
that an issue that a SPM had thought was Horizon related, was actually an
error with the SPM crediting a customer's account, instead of making a
withdrawal . In this same email chain, I feed back to Angela that reduced
classroom training meant the SPM was having to dedicate more time to a new

person and ask her to look into it.

173. If a complaint was particularly high profile or complex, then I might be asked
to oversee it. For example, in December 2014 Paula Vennells asked me to
sponsor a review of a complaint by SPM Haydi O’Brien, POL00150182. I
agree to sponsor it and to look at it objectively to see whether it raises any
wider issues. Similarly, in March 2015 Paula askes to me look into a
complaint from SPM David Atkins, POL00151726 and I can see from the
disclosure that I was copied into a letter from Nisha Kaur SPM to Paula
Vennells on 22 June 2017 about a phone alarm issue, POL00174666. The
documents disclosed do not assist me and I cannot recall what the outcome
of these complaints were. However, the course of action I would have
normally taken would be to contact the relevant senior manager responsible

and ask them to investigate and let me know their recommendations before

Page 76 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

finalising. This would then allow me to review, challenge or support the

outcome.

174.In the main, I was copied into correspondence on complaints so that I had a
general awareness and oversight of them and could input when needed,
particularly as a lot of the complaints related to operational issues. For
example, on 4 September 2014, there is an email chain, POL00355475,
where Michael Larkin (Head of Agency Network and my direct report) makes
me aware of an issue at a branch in Crichton Avenue. Michael asks Angela
Van Den Bogerd to advise and she says that the problems that the SPM is
experiencing are unacceptable and advises on how to stabilise the Horizon
connectivity and suggests a remuneration figure to cover the SPMs losses. I
follow on from this, asking to make sure that legal are comfortable with the

proposed wording for any payment to cover losses.

175.Following this complaint, I had correspondence with Rachael Maskell MP who
wrote to me about the issue as shown in POL00119501 (letter from Rachel to
me dated 4 November 2015) and POL00154419 (letter from me to Rachel
dated 11 December 2015). Similarly, POL00251201 is a letter from me to a
Jennifer Joannon JP dated 27 January 2017. This refers to two previous
letters of 7 and 16 January which have not been disclosed but from the
contents of the letter, Jennifer was writing to obtain information on a branch
which was closed due to an audit shortage. I would not have drafted the

wording of any external correspondence, but this would have been done by

Page 77 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

the Executive Communications Team, who would then pass the letter for me

to sign off.

176.Another example of how POL would respond to complaints can be seen from
a letter that was sent to Paula Vennells from a SPM, Mr Summers dated 19
March 2017 as shown in POL00423866 and attachment POL00423867. The
response is coordinated by the Executive Correspondence Team and
because the letter is extremely comprehensive covering a wide range of
issues, it has been sent to all the relevant senior managers to investigate and
copied to me as CEO Retail. POL00344413 is an email between myself,
Rebecca Barker (IT Service Manager) and others dated 10 February 2014
where Rebecca has provided an update on a joint visit with Fujitsu and POL
to look into Outreach site Horizon equipment which was experiencing issues.
On 15 February 2014, Paula Vennells emailed Chris Day and myself, copying
in Martin Edwards and Neil Hayward about a SPM Pervez Nakvi, who was
having problems within his branch, POL00373817. The email chain shows
that I picked up the complaint and took action ‘on the ground’, with Pam Heap
(Regional Area Manager) visiting the SPM on a Saturday to assist them.
Although I would not deal with every complaint personally, if it was particularly
important or I was asked to step in, I would take action as I did here. As
demonstrated above, my involvement was specific to individual cases, I was

not involved in formulating POL’s overall strategy in responding to complaints.

177.I have been asked to consider POL00249601 (email from me to Paula

Vennells dated 4 July 2017) and to explain my comment:

Page 78 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

“we can offer HNGa but this could throw doubt on the integrity of HNGx. We
took the prospective pmr to meet and speak to other pms who were positive
about the local model and the integrity of Horizon. However, 2 of the 3
brothers who are owners of the store believed that running a PO still

presented too big a risk.”

178.From what I recall, we were trying to open a new Post Office in Quarry Bank
and one of the prospective operators (being three brothers) pulled out
because they had concerns about Horizon in light of the media reports. Paula
Vennells asked me how we might provide reassurance and suggested that I
offer for them to use the next version of Horizon. I did not think that that was a
good idea because at the time, I believed that the current version of Horizon
was working as it should be and I thought that by offering to send a more
updated version, it might be perceived as POL not having confidence in the

existing version.

ENGAGEMENT WITH BARONESS NEVILLE-ROLFE FOLLOWING THE

MEDIATION SCHEME

179.As noted in the email sent by Jane Hill on 5 June 2015, POL00316792, Jane
and I met with Baroness Neville-Rolfe at the Post Office Penzance Road
branch in Ipswich on 5 June 2015. This was an informal, non-official visit as
Baroness Neville-Rolfe was in the area. The email notes that the SPM and
myself led the discussions, with the Baroness asking questions of a

Page 79 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

commercial nature, such as around branch and retail turnover, as well as
questions about Horizon and SPM training. Overall, Jane’s comments on the
meeting were positive. I would have attended this meeting because I was the
Network and Sales Director to answer questions about the operation of
branches and also to brief her on the Network Transformation and Crown
Transformation programmes as these were both very important matters at the

time and I would be best placed to answer any questions on them.

180.Paula Vennells responds to this email on 6 June 2015, POL00376515, and
asks me to put my ‘black hat’ on and drop a note of “where there could have
been negatives/challenges lurking behind the questions asked”. I take this to
mean that she wanted me to see whether anything negative could be taken
from the questions asked by Baroness Neville-Rolfe and our subsequent

answers.

181.1 respond on 7 June, POL00152132, reframing the questions that Baroness
Neville-Rolfe raised from a negative point of view and providing my answers. I
think that Paula had asked me to do this as she wanted to know what sorts of
questions Baroness Neville-Rolfe might ask POL about so that she would feel

prepared when she met her.

182.POL00162422 is an email from Mark Davies to me and others dated 11 June
2015. This references a meeting that he attended with Baroness Neville-
Rolfe, along with Al and Paula which he says was “very positive”. I cannot
remember the meeting and my comment “Great news. Well done mark”
Page 80 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

suggests that I was not there. However, I can see the briefing note,
UKGI00001074, sent to Baroness Neville-Rolfe ahead of a meeting on 11
June, lists me as one of the attendees. I cannot recall if this was a separate
meeting on the same day or if I was originally meant to attend but did not.
However, I think that I would have contributed to the briefing note for the

meeting.

183.On 8 July 2015 Paula Vennells emails myself and others, UKGI00004900,
forwarding a positive note from Baroness Neville-Rolfe, following a Board
Awayday and two executive meetings, one which included me. A copy of the
note has not been disclosed. I cannot remember this meeting or what the

content of it would have been about.

184.1 cannot recall having an ongoing working relationship with Baroness Neville-
Rolfe beyond the meetings referenced above but from memory and from the
tone of the emails discussing the meetings, all of my interactions with her

were positive.

GROUP LITIGATION

185.As I was on ExCo, I was kept up to date with the progress of the Group
Litigation Order (“GLO”). For example, on 25 January 2017, Jane MacLeod
emailed me, the Board and other senior members to let us know that the
preliminary hearing in relation to the litigation was to take place the next day,
POL00103302. Similarly, on 30 January 2017, Mark Davies provided an

Page 81 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

update to me and other senior managers of the outcome of hearing as part of
his weekly communications, POL00391120. That same day, I attended an
ARC meeting where I provided an update on branch compliance for financial
services. Minutes of this meeting are at POL00247182. I can see from the
minutes that there was also an update on the litigation but I would have only
attended the meeting to provide my update and would not have been present
for the litigation update. On 13 November 2017 I attended a Group Executive
meeting where I can see from the minutes, POL00251520, that there was a
verbal update on Group Litigation. However, I cannot recall the content of this
update. My involvement in the GLO was very minimal although, as can be
seen above, I was kept up to date with its progress due to my position as an

ExCo. I left POL before the case was heard.

186.1 was not responsible for developing POL’s general litigation strategy in
relation to the GLO, as this was led by the Legal team. However, I was briefed
on the proposed strategy, and asked for my input from a business perspective
as there were issues which fell under my responsibility (as shown in
POL00024700 (email from Jane MacLeod copied to me and others dated 20
September 2017) and POL00250687 (email from Jane MacLeod to me and
others dated 21 September 2017)), as well as potential implications to how
the branch network would be affected if the contractual issues in the litigation
went against POL. A paper, POL00250688, was then sent to the Board on 26

September 2017, setting out the different options..

Page 82 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

187.1 did not have any involvement in POL’s decision-making to disclosure of
documents, preparation of lay and expert evidence or its decision to seek

Fraser J recuse himself as I no longer worked at POL at that time.

188.P0L00391185 is an email dated 22 February 2017 from Jane McLeod,
forwarding a letter from Freeths (not disclosed). From reading the email, I
think that Freeths were contacting SPMs to gain support ahead of the GLO.
As I was responsible for the relationship with the NFSP, Jane was raising this
with Paula and me for briefing George Thomson and the NFSP more
generally to expect these kind of letters, which should be sent to Rod Ismay to
deal with. POL00248687 (email chain dated 19 April 2017) is a copy of this
email forwarded on to other senior colleagues without me copied in. I do not
remember speaking to the NFSP about the Group Litigation but I am sure that
they would have been kept updated about its progress. As noted above, I left

the business before the cases were heard.

LEAVING POL

189.In around November / December 2016, POL reorganised into two business
centres (retail and financial services), with Paula Vennells putting me in
charge of the retail business, as CEO Retail. However, this was on the
understanding that POL would begin actively recruiting externally for someone
with retail experience who would replace me. Once a replacement was found,
I was put on 6 months gardening leave, starting in January 2018. Although it
was a business decision for me to leave, I left on good terms.

Page 83 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

190. The Inquiry have disclosed POL00250878, a document dated 8 October 2017
which I have never seen before and for which I do not know who the author or
recipient is. The documents asks two questions about me, which appear to
have been answered by Mark Davies. The first question asks whether I have
been sacked to which the answer was “Absolutely not!...”. The second
question ask why two versions of the announcement of my leaving went out,
to which the answer was “Quite simply, we made a mistake and sent out an

earlier draft — we're sorry for the confusion this caused”.

191.From my recollection, POL made two announcements that I was leaving. The
first of these was quite blunt, simply stating that I was leaving but this was
followed by a more substantial and personal announcement. As noted in the
document, I understand that the first announcement was an initial draft sent in

error.

GENERAL

192.During my time at POL, as Network and Sales Director, I was completely
focused on delivering the Network and Crown Transformation programmes for
which there was tremendous pressure to deliver. This was also a priority and
focus for our Shareholder, Board and Executive as it formed a major part of
POLs overall transformation and route to profitability. On reflection, I think that
we were trying to do too much too quickly and because there were designated
teams set up to look into Horizon, I personally did not get as involved in it as I
Page 84 of 109

42349433.1
WITN10040100
WITN10040100

might otherwise had if Network and Crown Transformation was not

happening.

193.1 do not think that I could have done anything differently in respect of IT or
Legal issues but I can see now, how imbalanced the relationship was
between SPMs and POL. I would like to think that if I had been aware of this
at the time I would have sought independent advice on how to fix this. I
genuinely thought that I and those around me were trying to improve the
sustainability of the network and helping SPMs. To me, the SS review
highlighted that the problems weren't down to the Horizon system but that
there were shortcomings in our training and support. I can see now that we

were acting in error in focusing on operational issues.

194.1 truly and sincerely believed the messages I was receiving from POL on
Horizon. I believed that the Board, Executive and others that I worked with
genuinely wanted to get to the truth. We should have commissioned a
thorough independent review of the system. From what I have heard from the
Court hearings and Inquiry, I feel very frustrated that the extent of BEDs in the

system and the uncontrolled remote access was not disclosed.

195. There are no other matters that I wish to draw to the attention of the Chair.
