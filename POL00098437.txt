Dear Alan

Thank you for your email of the 21 May, and sorry I was not able to respond to you sooner as I have been on leave.

I am more than happy to meet both you and Kay to discuss the on-going Horizon Inquiry. Unfortunately, however, I
cannot make your suggested date of the 5 June.

My understanding is that we are too early in the investigation to suggest that things have been discovered which call
into question the integrity of the system or the validity of prosecutions, and to suggest that at this stage would be
wrong.

I have been advised that Second Sight have now agreed that the focus over the next few weeks will be on three specific
cases and it may be that a meeting would be more productive once that work has been completed so I will get Theresa
Iles, my PA, to contact you to set up a date towards the end of June if that works for you.

Kind regards
Paula

                      Hello Paula,




                                                                                                               POL-0098020
                                                                                                                    POL00098437
                                                                                                                 POL00098437



                It is been a while since we met at James Arbuthnot's office, but at that time you did say
                that if I had any concerns I should contact you directly, hence the reason for this email.

                Would it be possible for Kay Linnell and Ito meet with you? You will recall that Kay is an
                independent forensic accountant who, on behalf ofJFSA, has been monitoring the work
                2 Sight has been undertaking.

                The main purpose of the meeting is to ensure that you have been receiving the full
                details of what has been occurring with the 2 nd Sight investigation. Bearing in mind
                what has been discovered so far, I for one am surprised that we haven't yet met to
                discuss the implications. Whilst I appreciate that the majority of the issues began under
                previous regimes and you have expressed a genuine willingness to address the concerns
                that JFSA has been raising, these issues are still continuing. I have little doubt that it is
                now feasible to show that many of the prosecutions that POL have pressed home should
                never have taken place, and I believe this is a view shared by Kay.

                If you would like to meet with Kay and myself, we could attend an early afternoon
                meeting on Wednesday 5th June or could look for a suitable alternative date.

                Regards
                Alan
