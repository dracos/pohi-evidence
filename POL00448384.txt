A good outcome would be to make some big changes whilst maintaining your relationships inc with Nick -
quite difficult .

Subject: Key Agenda Items for Upcoming Board Meeting

Dear Chairman,

I trust this message finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming board meeting, I wish to draw your
attention to several critical matters demanding prompt consideration and discussion.

Confidential Email on Project Pineapple: As you are aware It has come to my attention that our confidential
email on Project Pineapple was sent to the individuals involved by Nick, this still needs resolving and my
email remains unanswered since my communication on Thursday evening. As PM I feel vulnerable and
exposed and have no where to go as this involves our investigations and whilst blowing team member.

Suspended Historic Employees: The presence of employees previously identified as high risk in the historic
scandal within our workforce raises concerns. A comprehensive review of all personnel involved in the
scandal is imperative to safeguard the integrity of our business. I recommend swift action to mitigate
potential risks. How was Brian Trotter still in the business until we visited the inquiry? Regarding Steve
Bradshaw I mentioned him to four individuals in the business on four different and at a board meeting
regarding his conduct / testimony and how this would cause our business further issues however, once
again I was ignored, is this because I am PM NED? Would this be the same if another NED raised this?

Disbandment of PM Engagement Team: this team lacks credibility and has failed to deliver on the
POL00448384
POL00448384

challenges faced by the PM community hence they have no respect within the wider network. I suggest the
strategic disbandment of the team. This recommendation is reinforced by their reluctance to conduct a
survey when outcomes were not anticipated in their favour. Granting the new Postmaster Director and
oversight committee control over forums and PM engagement is essential for us to effective and PM
centric.

Investigation of NDA's: A thorough investigation into all Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA's) executed since
CEO Nick assumed office is crucial. During the select committee hearing Nick was asked if he was aware of
any such agreements and he advised No, it is crucial we are transparent with the select committee but also
to protect our CEO with accurate information, can we investigate this?

Additionally, urgent steps are required to revoke NDA's with external entities, such as Fujitsu or Second
Sight, linked to the Horizon scandal. This decision should be communicated to the public promptly in order
to show we as a board want to help with justice and the inquiry.

Role of Ben Foat: I am proposing a comprehensive review and adjustment of the job role for Ben Foat, our
Legal Counsel, this involves reassigning him to the inquiry only and limiting his involvement in various
business areas. This adjustment is fundamental for reinforcing transparency and accountability and to
change our culture and indecision.

Culture: Postmaster discrimination must end immediately, this rhetoric of “they are all on the take and are
the same” is unacceptable. What Richard was caught saying is common within the walls POL, the language
used by employees can’t be spoken about Black people, Muslims or Jews because its discriminatory. The
CRO informing the board of extreme stories again is unhelpful and lacking integrity but then wanting PM’s to
pay 100% for automation and not strategic partners. The culture in this business is toxic and it needs more
PM’s involved in the entire organisation to help it refocus.

Establishment of Oversight Committee: In light of the evolving landscape, I recommend the immediate
establishment of an oversight committee ASAP, with PM Neds assuming leadership. Defining clear terms of
reference for the committee is essential to challenge cultural and procedural aspects and help ensure our
business never has untouchable employees, we must ensure we truly are PM centric.

I appreciate your attention to these matters and eagerly anticipate addressing them collectively during our
scheduled board meeting.
