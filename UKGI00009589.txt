RE: Post Office catch-up

Vandini, Ceci

Subje
Dear Ben,

In advance of our session with the Perm Sec tomorrow on Post Office, please find attached slides to be shared with
Alex in advance.

These contain more background than we can likely cover in detail in the session, but this will hopefully be useful for
Alex. Our preference would be to focus on slides 3, 4 and 8, but we’d be happy to discuss any issues in the pack
depending on Alex’s interests.

Best wishes,
Eleanor
