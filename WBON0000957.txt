Dear Andy
Long time etc — hope you’re well.

Many thanks for this and I agree with your recommendations and we will, please, take you up on the paralegal
support to perform 1 and 2.

Best wishes

Patrick

Mark
Please find attached a schedule showing those cases where a specific helpline complaint has been made.
16 of the cases provide sufficiently detailed information to allow a further investigation (highlighted in green).

11 more cases elude to a call happening in a particular week or month from which one could probably try to find the
details of the call from the POL call logs but this could require a lot of extra work (highlighted in yellow).

I would just look at the green cases as the yellow ones will require a degree of guesswork to identify the exact call. I
would also only look for calls to NBSC as I suspect POL will not have access to the HR records of employees on the
HSD (as this was operated by Fujitsu; now ATOS).
In terms of next steps, my suggestion would be:
1. Review the NBSC call logs for each green case to try to identify any relevant NBSC call reference ID numbers.
2. For each identified call, review the POIR and CRR to determine what has been said about these calls / issues
already.
3. From the call ref number POL should then be able to identify the call handler at NBSC and can make enquiries
about those call handlers.
I can offer some paralegals to help conduct 1 and 2 above if that would help.

Kind regards
Andy

Importance: High

Hi Andy,
I just tried to call but went through to your voicemail so, in the first instance, I thought I would send you a note.

As I think you are aware, the Chairman has now received the report from Jonathan Swift QC. This report contains a
number of recommendations, including for us to:

“cross reference specific complaints about misleading advice from NBSC call-handlers with the possible employees
who provided that advice and consider their personnel files, where available, for evidence as to the likelihood that
the complaint may be well founded”.

Our proposal to address this, as agreed with Jonathan, is for those Applicants who raised complaints in respect of
helpline:

© — Identify those who have particularised their complaint e.g. given a specific date
e Cross reference these calls against the call handler who would have taken the call

e — Check these call handlers PDRs to see if they had had any complaints made against them, in respect of the
advice they were providing.

Where we need your help, or rather your team of paralegal’s, is for them to trawl through the 107 cases that make
complaints in respect of the helpline (see column N of the attached spread sheet) and identify those which have

actually made particularised complaints rather than just generic ones.

As this is for the Chairman, we would like this done ASAP. When do you think you would be able to provide this
analysis by?
