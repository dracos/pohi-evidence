Richard / Laura

in his response to the (then) BIS Select Committee, the Secretary of State agreed that BIS should take receipt of a copy
of Second Sight’s Part Two Briefing Report when the final version was available (para 4.5). Please find this attached for
your information. I hope that this message meets the action on both BIS and Post Office.

Post Office cannot endorse the Report and sets out its reasons for this in a full response to it (also attached}. The Post
Office considers it is important that applicants are aware of its position on the matters covered in the Report and are
able to understand the reasons for it. Applicants can then take account of this when considering the extent to which
they wish to rely on the Report at mediation, if applicable.

Applicants should receive both reports tomorrow.

Kind regards

Tom

Subject: Letter from Vince Cable to BIS Select Committee

Tom, Mark

Please see attached letter from Vince Cable to the BIS Select Committee Chair, which has been copied to Paula Vennells.
The letter is a reply to Adrian Bailey’s letter regarding the Post Office mediation scheme, which as you know has also
been published on the Committee's website.

There are a few actions for Post Office to consider in this letter. Very happy to chat through if that would be helpful.
Many thanks

Laura
