Subject: New Acceptance Process

Keith, Chris

Following our meeting yesterday, I have put down my understanding of how Acceptance should work
in the future. I will be discussing this with various people next week (Andrew Simpkins, Graham
Shervington, Bob Burkin, Douglas Craik) to get their buy-in. I would appreciate it if you could have a
quick look and see whether there are any hostages to fortune/gross misconceptions. Comments by
close of play Monday would be appreciated.

1. PURPOSE

In early 2000, the PONU Automation Directorate re-organisation resulted in a
change to the meeting structure. In tandem, the Pathway Contractual Acceptance
activity was coming to a conclusion, and the Acceptance Team disbanded. This
paper describes the residual Acceptance activities and the new process and
responsibilities for managing these to a successful conclusion.

2. CURRENT ACCEPTANCE STATUS

412 Acceptance Incidents (AI) were raised by PONU. Each of these has been
assigned a PONU Accept Test Manager (ATM) whose job it is to agree the
rectification activities with Pathway and manage the AI to closure (Reference 1 gives
further information on the ATM Role and Responsibilities).

There are now nine Medium Severity Als and 48 Low Als still open. The details of
these are attached in Appendix 1. Further information on all Als can be obtained
from the maintainer of the Horizon Acceptance Database (HAD), currently Adrian
Curtin (e-mail address Lisa De-Sousa) in Product Management.

3. NEW REPORTING AND CLOSURE PROCESS

The new reporting and closure process described in this section is based on the
assumptions that (a) the current ATMs will continue managing their current Als and
(b) the head of their group will take on the responsibilities of the Acceptance
Manager in terms of monitoring progress, resolving issues and approving closure of
an Acceptance incident. The three groups involved are:

¢ BSM - (they own 1 medium and 3 low open incidents)
¢ CSR+ Project (they own 7 medium and 43 low open incidents)
¢ Implementation Project (they own 1 medium and 2 low open incidents)

The diagram below summarises the new reporting and closure processes. The rest of
this section describes each of these in more detail.

This relates to the AI management information as follows:

of putting the new processes in place it is intended that Appendix 1 will have an
up-to-date list of these key people

¢ Closure criteria and target date (for Low Als only). The closure criteria are
mostly agreed. A summary of these is contained on the Low AI Resolution plan
(which will be held by the Programme Office). Work is on-going to determine the
target date for closure. In contrast to the Medium rectification plans there is no
contractual significance to the target dates for closure

¢ Rectification plan. These are contractually agreed and referred to in the First
Supplemental agreement (reference 2). There have been some changes to these
plans agreed at various Delivery meetings. (DN do we need to bring these together

It is the responsibility of the amin . ue are tite information is complete and inform

Programme Management of any changes.

3.2 Maintain AI Information (Programme Management)
As the basis for Acceptance progress reporting and issue management, Programme

Management (Bob Burkin) will maintain the summary information relating to the
open Als.

3.3 Manage and Report Progress (PONU ATM)
The PONU ATM will report progress on each of his/her Als to his/her line manager.

The form and frequency of reporting will be determined by the individual groups, but
it is envisaged that the CSR+ reporting will continue as at present (Reference 3).

3.4 Produce Consolidated Reports (Line managers - fortnightly?)

Each group will produce a consolidated report on the progress and issues for review
with Pathway at the appropriate management meeting:

¢ Implementation Project - Joint National Roll-out Board.
f 3.5 Produce Overall Acceptance Status Report (Programme Office - monthly?)
Cru The purpose of the overall Acceptance Status Report is to summarise progress and
issues on all incidents. (DN not clear who will receive this. The original intention
neeryicdn was for this to be for information only to a PONU/Pathway umbrella group. As there
may not be a single group managing the PONU/Pathway relationship the options

3.6 Recommend Closure (PONU ATM)

The ATM’s role in closure of Als will continue as now. When the ATM is satisfied
that the closure criteria have been met, he/she should e-mail his/her line manager
explaining the reason for and recommending closure. The ATM should consult with
appropriate business representatives who typically have been involved during the
life-time of the AI.

NB the e-mail recommending closure is part of the audit trail and will be
incorporated in the HAD and the paper Acceptance records. It is important that the
ATM gives a full explanation of why the AI is now fit for closure. The ATM should
assume that the reader has no knowledge of the activities leading up to closure.
Cross-refer or attach any relevant documentation.

For Medium Severity Als only, the ATM should copy the closure recommendation e-
mail to Keith K Baines.

3.7 Approve Closure (ine Manager)

The Line Manager assures that closure is appropriate and properly documented. He
forwards his approval of the recommendation to the HAD maintainer, Adrian Curtin
(“Lisa De-Sousa”) and to Programme Office (Bob Burkin).

3.8 Update Paper Records (Programme Office)

Acceptance files are kept by the Programme Office of each AI. These are updated
with the closure details. Summaries of the AI management information (see 2 above)
should also be updated.

3.9 Handover to Closure Baton Recipient

For a number of the Als, there will be on-going monitoring to ensure that the AI
solution does not regress. The ATM will be responsible for properly briefing the
Baton Recipient (DN - more guidance on this needs to be included here when the
issue has been discussed with BSM).

Typically (as shown in appendix 1) the baton will be passed to BSM. In the past this
has not always been done, and a review of all currently closed Als will take place
shortly to identify any missed batons.

4, IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PROCESS

It is proposed to implement this new process with effect from (Monday 14”
February). Leading up to the 14°, focussed around drafts of this document, key
players will be discuss and agree the new process and their responsibilities within it.
