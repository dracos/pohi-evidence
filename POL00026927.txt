Strategic Report

The Strategic Report forthe Post Office comprises the Chairman’s Foreword, Chief
Executive’s Statement and Financial and Business Review.

Chairman’s Foreword

I am pleased to report that the Post Office Limited has had another year of progress. Our focus
continues to be on creating stronger foundations to provide better services to our customers and to
support postmasters who run our branches. At the same time, we have been set a challenge by
Government to become, for the first time in recent history, a self-sustaining company free of public
subsidy. To achieve this, we are going to have to work harder than ever before. We must match the
pace of change in the industry, embrace new technology, adapt to market trends and meet the ever
rising expectations of our customers.

Our recent results show that we are effectively transforming the business to remain relevant, easily
accessible and the first choice for customers. We grew revenue by 2% to £972m and our trading profit
increased by £25 million to £60 million. We believe we are on the right track; the success of our
Banking Framework arrangements with the UK’s banks has seen us become the biggest high street
provider of cash and point of access for everyday banking services in the country. We are now the last
cash provider in thousands of communities, reflecting our social purpose in action, supporting the
consumers and small businesses which fuel local economies. There is more growth to come and we
are working hard to expand this offer, to simplify the processes underpinning it and provide a better
share of that success to our postmasters.

Elsewhere we performed well against strong competition and emerging market trends. Our Insurance
business continued to grow in the competitive travel market. Telecoms increased its customer base
whilst significantly shifting it towards broadband. In savings, we broadly maintained total balances,
against a backdrop of low interest rates, excess funding in the market, and new entrants offering very
competitive rights to quickly gain market share.

This year’s acquisition of Payzone Bill Payments Limited (“Payzone”) underscores our determination
to extend our reach and accessibility for both corporate and retail customers. The integration of
Payzone’s bill payments business will more than double the number of outlets at which these services
can be conveniently transacted to 25,000 sites. This provides us with a much stronger platform
through which to innovate and win new contracts from a wide range of corporate clients.

To support postmasters, we have been reviewing our ways of working to ensure that effort and
complexity are kept to a minimum, whilst looking to extend their product offering and rebalancing
transaction fees. Our ambition is to attract and retain high quality business people to deliver for all
our customers with energy and care. The ongoing litigation involving Post Office and a group of
postmasters is an important reminder that this aspect of our work reflects the fact that there have
been disagreements in the past on the management of contractual relationships. We are determined
in future to have the very best working relationship fit for today’s business environment, and that we
must always strive to do even better.

As ever, it is our people, whether working in branches across the country, in our supply chain or in
our support centres, who are making these changes happen and I would like to thank them for their
continued support and their dedication to making this business successful.

I would also like to express my appreciation to our Shareholder, the Secretary of State at the
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (“BEIS”), as well as his Ministers and officials
in UK Government Investments and BEIS for their collaboration and support across the year. My
colleagues on the Post Office Board and the Executive Team have, once again, demonstrated real
drive and energy in addressing the many challenges involved in modernising the Post Office for future
generations.

I would like to extend particular thanks to Paula Vennells for her service over the past seven years as
Chief Executive, leading and transforming this unique business towards an even brighter future. During

Paula‘s leadership, Post Office has grown from a company that was losing £120 million a year, with a
branch network in desperate need of modernising, to a strong, customer-focused, innovative and
profitable business. She is leaving the business in much better shape and I wish her every success for

the future.
Finally I would like to welcome Nick Read who takes over as her successor and wish him all the best
For the future, enn nnn

Chief Executive Statement

The Post Office matters more today than ever before. Providing essential services to millions of
consumers and small businesses, day-in, day-out, across the UK is a unique privilege. We are,
therefore, relentlessly focused on what needs to be done to evolve Post Office so it is relevant for
future generations, financially robust to weather new challenges, and always faithful to our central
purpose: being there for every customer in every community.

We are growing net revenue now and continue to improve our profitability. This money is invested in
the business so we continue to provide Postmasters and customers with free access to cash, reliable
systems, the ability to comply with regulations and access to competitive products that customers
want. Customers’ buying visits to Post Offices fell by just 1% last year, a significant achievement in
an increasingly online world. We are also expanding our own services online to ensure that customers
access our markets in the way they choose.

We are hugely grateful to Postmasters and I particularly want to thank them for the extraordinary
service they provide — Post Office does not exist without Postmasters and our customers benefit every
day from their care and willingness to go beyond their standard duties. This literally saves lives as
recognised in our recent awards, whether it’s checking on the vulnerable customer who hasn’t been
into their Post Office or helping a heart attack customer until the ambulance arrived.

We are very mindful of the pressures on Postmasters and we are absolutely committed to making it
easier for them to serve customers and run profitable businesses. We have announced an increase in
pay for banking deposits and will announce further improvements in the autumn. We are working hard
to improve training and support, prevent errors, resolve them more quickly and reduce Postmasters’
costs.

This year saw us complete our Network Transformation Programme, by far the biggest change we
have ever made, recognising that standalone Post Offices are rarely commercially viable. Investing in
and modernising over 7,700 branches has resulted in significant increases in opening hours and levels
of customer satisfaction. Over that period, we opened 440 new Post Offices in new locations, part of
our strategy to increase convenience and choice for customers who want easier access to our services
on their doorstep. With 11,638 branches as at the year-end (2018: 11,547), our network is more
stable than in the past. A detailed breakdown will be available in this year’s Network Report.

We are continuing to franchise branches to independent Postmasters, moving services from standalone
Post Offices into retailers’ premises. Post Office has always been a franchise network (93% in 1970)
and unless the underlying economics change, we will continue in this direction. It is clear that the
process by which we consult to make sure the new service works for everyone can, and should be,
improved. We have launched a review and will revert. with new ways to engage local communities.

We are consolidating and strengthening our position in some of our traditional markets, such as bill
payments. Following clearance by the Competition and Markets Authority in October 2018, the
successful acquisition of Payzone’s bill payments business gives us a combined network of 25,000
locations at which customers can conveniently pay for essential services.

We have retained our position as number one in letters and parcels, with significant growth in home
shopping returns offsetting the continued decline in stamps. Online shopping has continued to drive
strong growth in Collections and Return volumes and we are working closely with Royal Mail to
innovate and improve our customer offering. This year we launched the new ‘Labels to Go’ service for

online shoppers to print a returns label at their local Post Office, by simply using a QR code on their
mobile phone or tablet.

Our travel proposition also continues to grow as we leverage our market leading position in Travel
Money, using technology to enhance our offer. More than 300,000 customers are already using our
new Travel App. This enables customers to manage their Travel Money Card accounts 24/7 from
anywhere in the world, as well as providing easy access to travel insurance. Over 700 branches are
now offering Passport Digital Check and Send, enabling branches to process applications online,
dramatically improving the customer experience, while boosting security. To round off what has

Post Office Limited corporate.postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 4
POL00026927
POL00026927

become a one stop shop for our customers’ travel needs, we made International Driving Permits
available in 2,500 branches across the country, selling 350,000 permits over two months.

Over 900,000 new customers registered for our GOV.UK Verify service, which provides a secure, and
re-usable, means of definitive identity assurance giving customers access to a range of online
Government services. The opportunity now is to build on this success and expand the benefits of
digital identity to a much broader range of users and organisations. We believe the Post Office is
ideally placed to help grow this wider market, and we are seeking to rekindle Government’s impressive
early interest and positive action in the development of this new and transformative technology. We
are also seeking to work closely with Government on its planned replacement services for the Post
Office Card Account, ensuring that vulnerable customers are looked after.

Concerns over bank branch closures across the country have grown louder across the year and
underscore just how important the continued availability of access to basic banking services through
the Post Office is to communities. Since its inception in January 2017, we have significantly grown the
volume of transactions we undertake on behalf of all the UK’s major banks and there is more to come.

So many people care deeply about Post Offices and can be very critical of us at Post Office Limited,
whether it’s over franchising, Postmaster pay, our conduct of the Group Litigation or the day to day
service we provide. My message to them and to all of our people is that we welcome the criticism -
we all want successful Post Offices open everywhere and for years to come. We will continually work
with our critics across the business to learn and improve.

It has been a privilege to lead Post Office for a few months and I welcome Nick Read to take us forward
and capture our very real opportunities. The thank you list is too long to repeat here but I would single
out Postmasters and front line colleagues who deliver for customers every day.

Financial and Business Review

Summary results

We delivered our third consecutive year of profit as we continue on the path to commercial
sustainability.

Operating profit was £6 million (2018: £47 million). This is after increased depreciation and
amortisation charges of £94 million (2018: £55 million), and exceptional items of £20 million (2018:
£3 million).

Trading profit increased by £25 million to £60 million (2018: £35 million). Our revenue grew by £16
million during 2018/19 to £972 million (2018: £956 million). Growth was driven by our Mails (5%),
Telecoms (4%), Identity (7%) and Insurance (15%) business areas.

As planned, the Network Subsidy Payment (“NSP”) from Government decreased by £10 million to £60
million (2018: £70 million). NSP is to cover the costs of loss making branches which deliver our social
purpose. It is our responsibility to demonstrate that the NSP received is equal to or less than the total
loss these social purpose branches create. If the loss is less than the NSP, we are obliged to pay the
difference back to Government. This reduction in the NSP has been offset by cost reductions of £1
million and revenue growth of £16 million. As a result, adjusted EBITDA increased by £15 million to
£120 million (2018: £105 million).

Significant accounting judgements

Going concern

The Group (being the Group of companies headed by Post Office Limited) has net assets of £244
million at 31 March 2019 (2018: £203 million) and headroom on the loan from BEIS of £385 million
(2018: £327 million). This is £185 million above the target minimum headroom of £200 million, hence
we are not at risk of breaching this limit. We have also been profitable at a trading profit level with
current year profit of £60 million (2018: £35 million) and shown a profit after tax of £40 million (2018:
£17 million).

We have the following funding agreed with BEIS: a working capital facility of £950 million to 31 March
2021; a further £50 million facility available to provide same day liquidity to 4 April 2020; NSP of £50
million for 2019/20 and 2020/21 respectively; and we also have investment funding of up to £210
million available for the period from April 2018 to March 2020. Investment funding of £168 million
was received in 2018/19.

After careful consideration of the plans for the coming years, we continue to believe that Post Office
will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the next 12 months. Accordingly, on that basis,
the Directors consider that it is appropriate that these financial statements have been prepared on a
going concern basis.

Profit and Loss

As disclosed in the consolidated income statement in the financial statements on page 41, we have split
the results of the Group between trading and investments. Together these combine to give the results
of the Group. This presentation clearly separates the underlying trading of the business from the change
activity being undertaken to ensure the future sustainability of the Post Office. In the following sections,
we consider each of the columns of our consolidated income statement which combine to give an
operating profit of £40 million (2018: £15 million). Once finance income/costs, taxation credit/charge
have been factored in, the profit for the financial year is £40 million (2018: £17 million). See the
consolidated income statement on page 41 for full details.

Revenue

The Post Office business is organised into three strategic business units, Retail, Financial Services &
Telecoms (including Insurance) and Identity. Revenue from our subsidiary Post Office Management
Services Limited is included within the Insurance line below. Revenue from our subsidiary Payzone Bill
Payments Limited (“Payzone”) is included within the Payment Services line below. The divisions and
their performance are detailed on the next pages:

The grouping of products has altered in 2018/19 as a result of changes to internal reporting, with Post
Office Card Account (“POCA”) revenue moving from Government Services to Cash & Banking Services.
Remaining Government Services revenue has been moved into the Identity business unit. Banking
Services and ATMs revenue have also moved into Cash & Banking Services from Financial Services.
Commission income relating to Government Services has been reclassified from revenue to other
income because it did not fall within the scope of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The impact of these changes on the reported 2017/18 performance of the divisions is detailed below:

POL00026927

Retail
The Retail business encompasses our position as the United Kingdom’s number one mails provider, as
well as providing Cash & Banking and Payment services.

Mails

Mails includes the sale of parcels and other mails products provided by Royal Mail and Parcelforce.
Underlying trading revenue is up £16 million (5%) year on year. Growth in parcels (7%) and home
shopping returns (35%) is partially offset by the continuing decline in stamps. In addition, there were
planned reductions in the fixed fee element of the contract with the Royal Mail Group plc of £2 million.

Retail & Lottery

Retail & Lottery revenue has decreased by £3 million to £42 million (2018: £45 million). The reduction
reflects the changing shape of our branch network; although, a higher number of lottery rollovers did in
part offset the trend toward online sales.

Payment Services

Payment Services includes bill payment transactions. Revenue has remained flat at £27 million (2018:
£27 million). The acquisition of Payzone contributed £4 million to revenue, offset by reduced volumes in
the reseller market of £4 million.

Cash & Banking Services

Cash & Banking Services comprise of POCA, Banking and ATM services. Revenue has increased by £3
million to £161 million (2018: £158 million). ATMs revenue has remained stable despite market decline.
POCA revenue has decreased in line with expectations. This has been offset by significant year on year
growth in Banking Services as high street banks continued to close branches, and following the switch
made to automated deposit transactions from October 2018.

Financial Services & Telecoms

Financial Services
Our Financial Services products include mortgages, credit cards, savings and travel money, in addition
to postal orders. Revenue decreased by £14 million to £113 million (2018: £127 million).

The majority of the decrease is due to Bank of Ireland products, down £12 million to £45 million (2018:
£57 million). The competitive, customer and regulatory environments remain tough; the continued low
rate environment and Bank of England funding scheme are putting pressure on Mortgage margins and
savings rates. Mortgages are also challenged by pricing constraints, but the expansion into the Broker.
channel is compensating for this.

Revenue from Postal Orders declined by £2 million as this legacy product continues to decline in the
marketplace. The impact of Brexit uncertainty, weak sterling and tighter AML regulations continue to
impact MoneyGram and to a lesser extent travel money, which has remained stable year on year.

Telecoms
Telecoms includes Post Office HomePhone, Broadband and Fibre services.

Telecoms revenue of £153 million increased by £6 million (2018: £147 million) as customer numbers
have increased.

Insurance

Post Office Insurance provides Travel, Life and General insurance policy cover. Insurance revenue has
grown by £7 million to £55 million (2018: £48 million). The increase was driven mainly by growth in our
Over SOs Life insurance and Travel insurance businesses.

Post Office Limited corporate.postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 10
POL00026927

POL00026927

Identity

Identity provides Home Office, DVLA and Verify services. Identity revenue has grown by £4 million to
£58 million (2018: £54 million) due to the launch of Universal Credit in Verify. A new pricing
arrangement with the Government Digital Service in November 2018 significantly reduced average
margin for the Verify service, and will do so in the future.

Costs
Total costs decreased by £1 million to £959 million (2018: £960 million).

People costs of £193 million increased by £4 million (2018: £189 million) due to pay increases.

Average headcount reduced from 5,066 in 2017/18 to 4,700 in 2018/19 reflecting the evolving shape of
our operations and the effect of the Network and DMB transformation programmes. Closing headcount for
the year was 4,391 (2018: 5,020). .

Other operating costs decreased by £5 million to £766 million (2018: £771 million) of which £3 million
relates to landlord compensation payments, with other controlled cost savings noted, especially in IT.

Depreciation and amortisation

Depreciation and amortisation charges increased to £94 million (2018: £55 million); a number of
significant assets under construction came into use during the year and are now being depreciated or
amortised.

Exceptional costs

On 11 April 2016, a High Court claim was issued on behalf of a number of postmasters against Post
Office in relation to various legal, technical and operational matters, many of which have been the
subject of significant external focus for a number of years.

The litigation is very complex and the Judge ordered that it will be heard as a series of trials.

The first trial, which finished on 5 December 2018, was about determining the legal construction of the
contract between Post Office and postmasters. The Judgment from this trial was made public on 15
March 2019.

On 23 May 2019, the Court awarded the Claimants their costs in respect of the first trial. As a result,
Post Office was instructed to make a payment on account of £6 million. These costs have been
recognised in 2018/19 as they reflect conditions that existed at the end of this reporting period.

The second trial, about technical matters concerning Post Office’s Horizon computer system started on
11 March 2019 and concluded on 2 July 2019 when the Judge retired to consider his judgment. The
judgment is not expected to be handed down before mid-September 2019.

Neither the first nor second trial have or will determine liability or the individual claimants’ cases. A
further third trial has been scheduled for March 2020, but the fourth trial has not yet been set down.

Further, a number of the Claimants assert that they have been convicted of criminal offences arising
from their roles at Post Office, with 31 of those cases being considered by the Criminal Cases Review
Commission (“CCRC”). The CCRC has the power to refer cases to the Court of Appeal who, in turn,
have the power to overturn a conviction. This could then lead to claims for compensation.

To date, the Claimants have not asserted the aggregate value of their claims in any of the Particulars
of Claim filed in the litigation.

While the Directors recognise that an adverse outcome would be material, they are currently unable to
determine whether the outcome of these proceedings would have a material adverse impact on the
consolidated position of the Group, and are unlikely to be able to do so until the Court has made further
determinations and the Claimants have provided the necessary information about the value of their
claims, The Directors continue to keep this under close review.

The Post Office Group Litigation represents a possible obligation arising from past events, whose
existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future
events not wholly within the control of the Group.

The costs of £20 million included in exceptional items relate to Post Office defending the Post Office
Group Litigation (2018: £3 million) during the financial year.

On 14 June 2018, an Employment Tribunal claim was issued on behalf of a number of postmasters

Post Office Limited corporate.postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 11
POL00026927
POL00026927

against Post Office in which they seek to establish that they are "workers" of Post Office and therefore
have rights to holiday pay.

Post Office's position is that postmasters are independent contractors in business on their own account,
not workers, and this is supported by previous case law. However, if postmasters were to establish they
are workers they would gain a number of additional rights such as to take and be paid for annual leave
and a right to receive the National Minimum Wage/National Living Wage. This would likely result in
future increased business costs and retrospective claims for compensation.

The litigation is at a relatively early stage. Post Office and the Claimants are currently going through a
process of agreeing ‘test cases’. It is anticipated that this process will be complete by 11 October 2019.

On 11 October 2019 there will be a hearing, which will set a date for a future preliminary hearing to
decide whether or not the Claimants have worker status. No date has been set for that hearing but Post
Office does not expect it to take place prior to April 2020.

That first hearing will only determine the legal principle of whether postmasters (or some categories of
postmaster) are workers. Should the Claimants succeed on this point, a further trial will be required to
decide the value of their quantum of their claims. No date has been set for this at present.

To date, the Claimants have not asserted the value of their claims.

This litigation represents a possible obligation arising from past events, whose existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly
within the control of the Group.

While the Directors recognise that an adverse outcome could be material, they are currently unable to
determine whether the outcome of these proceedings would have a material adverse impact on the
consolidated position of the Group, and are unlikely to be able to do so until the Employment Tribunal
has determined the worker status question and the Claimants have provided the necessary information
about the value of their claims. The Directors continue to keep this under close review.

Joint venture

Post Office Limited has a joint venture with the Bank of Ireland with each holding 50% of First Rate
Exchange Services Holdings Limited. The principal activity of the business is the supply of foreign
exchange in the UK to the Post Office and others. The share of operating profit from the joint venture
was £33 million (2018: £34 million).

Restructuring costs include the costs of delivery for major change programmes. In addition, we have
incurred £139 million (2018: £151 million) of capital spend, primarily on IT transformation projects, as
disclosed in notes 8 and 9. Combined with restructuring costs of £134 million (2018: £102 million), the
total invested in the year was £273 million (2018: £253 million).

These are offset by Government funding, recognised to match the associated costs. Government funding

for 2018/19 of £168 million (2018: £70 million) was received in quarterly instalments and was fully
recognised in the year.

BEIS has approved funding of up to £210 million which is available for the period from April 2018 to
March 2020. The maximum available in 2018/19 was £168 million and this was received in full.

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to £572 million (2018: £655 million) at the year-end. There was
a net cash outflow during the year of £83 million (2018: £25 million).

Net debt (excluding cash in the Post Office network) decreased by £69 million year on year as shown
in the table below.

Post Office Limited seeks to minimise the amount drawn down on the loan from BEIS in order to
reduce its interest cost. The facility is limited to a maximum of £950 million, the unused facility at the
end of the year was £385 million (2018: £327 million). The maximum drawn down under the facility
during the year was £744 million on 13 April 2018. The facility is available at two days’ notice and has
an end date of 31 March 2021.

Post Office Limited’s borrowing facility from the Government limits the purposes for which the facility
can be used and, together with borrowing limits contained in the Articles of Association, imposes
constraints on the availability of external borrowing.

The Bank of England Note Circulation Scheme

The continued participation in the Note Circulation Scheme (“NCS”) assures that Post Office Limited has
an adequate supply of notes to meet customer demand across its network and provides a mechanism
for enabling Post Office Limited to hold Bank of England owned notes. At the end of the year £227 million
(2018: £238 million) of Bank of England owned notes were held. See note 22 on page 83 for further
details on the NCS.

Post Office also has an arrangement in Scotland with a commercial banking partner whereby surplus
Scottish notes are sold to the partner overnight for repurchase the next day. At the end of the year a
total of £3 million (2018: £17 million) was outstanding under this arrangement.

The above amounts were not recognised on the Post Office balance sheet at year end.

Pensions
Post Office Limited is the principal employer of the Post Office Section of the Royal Mail Pension Plan
(“RMPP”), which is independent of the Royal Mail section of the RMPP. Royal Mail Group Limited is the

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 13
POL00026927
POL00026927

principal employer of the Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan (*RMSEPP”) and Post Office Limited
is a participating employer within RMSEPP. RMPP and RMSEPP are both defined benefit plans. The Post
Office operates a defined contribution scheme — the Post Office Pension Plan.

Both defined benefit plans are closed to new members and closed to future accrual.

In 2016/17, a Memorandum of Understanding was executed by Post Office with the Trustee of RMPP.
This removed the unconditional right to refund from the RMPP. As a result of these events the surplus
relating to this Plan was derecognised.

In 2017/18, the Trustees of the pension scheme entered into an agreement with Rothesay Life PLC in
which a pension buy-in was effected by the purchase of two bulk annuities. Under the purchase
agreements, the Trustees of the pension plan bought an asset that provides income which matches
closely the benefit payments from the pension plan, achieving a material risk reduction as changes in
income mirror changes in benefits due to, for example, inflation and longevity.

The accounting surplus reduced by the difference between the insurance premium and the value of the
insured liabilities, creating a ‘loss’ on buy-in. There was also an ancillary premium as part of the buy-in
agreement which transferred to the insurer the risk of incorrect data being used to price the premium.
These items were recognised in Other Comprehensive Income in 2017/18. As Post Office had no right
to a future surplus in the scheme, there was an equal and opposite adjustment to the asset ceiling
through Other Comprehensive Income. As a result, there was no effect on the net assets position of the
Group.

The immaterial deficit payments into RMSEPP were agreed with the pension trustees during the year
and payments were made in accordance with the agreements. The net cash payments made are detailed
below:

2019 2018

£m —m

Regular pension contributions (20) (20)
Funding of the pension deficit - RMSEPP - (1)
Payments relating to redundancy (4) (5)
Net cash payments ; (21) (26)-

The income statement charge to trading for the year was £13 million (2018: £17 million) in relation
to the defined contribution scheme. There was no charge (2018: £nil) in relation to the defined benefit
scheme.

Board

Role and responsibilities

The Board is accountable to the Secretary of State for BEIS, as the sole shareholder, for the
performance of the Company and is required to seek consent for certain matters, as included in the
Articles of Association. The Shareholder is briefed regularly on the performance of the business and
the progress to deliver the strategy.

The Board is also responsible for oversight of legal and regulatory compliance, delivery of the
strategy, providing constructive challenge to the Group Executive and communicating with the
Shareholder. The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its decision and has approved Terms
of Reference for its committees, which are available on the Post Office Limited website.

The Board annually reviews the strategy, approves the annual budget and business plan required to
deliver the strategic objectives for that year; the last approval was 30 April 2019. The Board regularly
reviews reports on performance against that plan and receives periodic business reports from senior
management. Directors are briefed on matters to be discussed at Board and Committee meetings
by papers distributed in advance of meetings, as well as management presentations.

In setting the risk appetite for Post Office Limited the Board has established a framework to manage
and mitigate risk. The Board takes guidance from its Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee, and
has oversight of risk management. This Committee receives reports from the executive Risk and
Compliance Committee, from the internal and external audit teams and from operational
management. Further detailed information on the management of risk within Post Office Limited,
together with identification of principal risks, their impacts and mitigation can be found in the
management of risk section on pages 28 to 33.

Key focus and achievements in 2018/19
During the year to 31 March 2019, the Board continued to oversee the Post Office Limited’s strategic
plan to achieve commercial sustainability and profitability.

This included project approvals, monitoring of developments in IT strategy, and services in the digital
space. These developments are designed to enhance customer experience and offer services that
meet customer needs in a digital age while continuing to serve our social purpose.

The Company acquired Payzone Bill Payments Limited on 24 October 2018. The business has over
25 years’ experience in the bill payments industry and offers payment terminals for bills, tickets,
lottery and mobile top up in convenience stores, enabling these businesses to generate revenue and
increase footfall.

The Board approved the appointment of new external auditors, following the resignation of Ernst &
Young LLP at the end of their term of engagement. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were appointed as
the Company’s external auditors on 31 July 2018 following a tender process.

The Board also focused on a revised banking framework to provide banking services in Post Office
branches on behalf of UK banks and approved investment for the Branch Hub (a self-service portal
for branch operators and business owners to access support).

The Board continued to monitor the progress of the ongoing Group Litigation Order.

Conflicts of Interest and Independence

The Board may, in the furtherance of its duties, seek independent professional advice at the expense
of Post Office Limited. During the period, no Director sought independent professional advice.

In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Articles of Association give the Directors power to
authorise conflicts of interest.

During the period, none of the Directors had a material interest in any contract of significance with
Post Office Limited or any of its subsidiaries. At all times during the periods of their appointments in
2018/19, the independent Directors met the criteria for independence set by the Board.

Post Office Limited has arranged appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal action against
Directors of Post Office Limited and its subsidiaries.

Tim Parker, Ken McCall, Tim Franklin, Shirine Khoury-Haq and Carla Stent are considered
Independent Non-Executive Directors. Tom Cooper is not an independent Non-Executive Director as
he is a shareholder representative. Paula Vennells and Alisdair Cameron held executive roles
throughout the financial year, and as such were not independent directors.

Board Meetings
During 2018/19 the Board met 12 times (including additional meetings held either in person or by

telephone). A record of Directors’ attendance (attended/eligible to attend)* at the Board and its

Committees

To assist in the execution of its corporate governance responsibilities, the Board has established
three committees which deal with specific topics requiring independent oversight. The Audit, Risk
and Compliance, Nominations, and Remuneration Committees are each chaired by an independent
Non-Executive Director.

The Board retains overall oversight but delegates responsibilities and authorities to its committees
to operate within the Terms of Reference approved by the Board. The Terms of Reference for all
committees are reviewed annually to assess that each Committee discharged its duties effectively in
accordance with the Terms of Reference. The reviews conducted in March 2019 raised no issues.

Terms of Reference for the committees are available on the Post Office Limited website:
www.corporate. postoffice.co.uk/our-leadership.

Nominations Committee
Role and Membership

The duties and responsibilities of the Nominations Committee are included in the Terms of Reference,

Work of the Committee in 2018/19

During the year the Committee considered the skills and experience required by the Board for a new
Group Chief Executive and a new Non-Executive Director and worked with Russell Reynolds (search
consultants) on the proposed appointments. The Committee approved re-appointments to subsidiary
boards and the appointment of a new Chair of Post Office Management Services Limited.

The Nominations Committee monitored the independence and internal process for the evaluation of
the Board and Board sub-committees and considered developments in corporate governance and
how these should apply to the Company.

The Committee considered the reporting requirements under the Companies (Miscellaneous
Reporting) Regulations 2018 and a section will be introduced to the 2019/20 Annual Report to show
how the requirements of Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 were fulfilled, including having
regard for the views of the shareholder, employees, customers and suppliers when making decisions.

Remuneration Committee

The role, membership and work of the Remuneration Committee is detailed in the Remuneration
Committee Chairman’s Statement on pages 21 to 27.

Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee

Role and Membership

The duties and responsibilities of the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee are included in the
Terms of Reference which are available on the Post Office Limited website:
www.corporate. postoffice.co.uk/our-leadership.

The Committee is chaired by Carla Stent, Non-Executive Director, and the other members during the
year were Ken McCall, Senior Independent Director, Tom Cooper, Non-Executive Director and Tim
Franklin, Non-Executive Director.

The Board considers that the Committee’s members have broad commercial knowledge and
extensive business leadership experience and that this constitutes an appropriate mix of business
and financial experience and expertise.

The Directors of Risk & Compliance and Head of Internal Audit attended all of the meetings of the
Committee and also met the Committee Chair, independently and regularly, throughout the year.

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 19
POL00026927
POL00026927

The external auditor was invited to, and attended, all meetings of the Committee except on 31 July
2018, where the Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of new external auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

Further detailed information on the management of risk within Post Office Limited, together with
identification of principal risks, their impacts and mitigation, can be found in the Management of Risk
section on pages 28 to 33.

Work of the Committee in 2018/19
During the year, the Committee reviewed the Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2017/18,
including consideration of the principal and strategic risks, and recommended Board approval.

The Committee approved the annual audit plans for the internal and external auditors. The
Committee received and challenged, where appropriate, internal audit reports.
The Committee reviewed the risk management framework for the Company, including its appetite
for risk, self-assessment of the control framework and areas of specific risk highlighted by the
Executive Risk and Compliance Committee. It reviewed and approved relevant policies, such as
financial crime and protecting personal data, as part of an annual review cycle.

Board and Committee Effectiveness Evaluations
The Board recognises that an effective Board is vital to the success of the Company and the business.
Ken McCall, Senior Independent Director, led an internal Board effectiveness evaluation in December

2018 which included a formal evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and the
Chair.

The Board evaluation was conducted by internal questionnaire and, following a review of the results,
recommendations were presented to the Board. The feedback and scores were positive but areas for
additional focus were identified, including closer engagement with and understanding of
stakeholders’ perspectives, particularly postmasters and employees; the competitor landscape and
franchising models; and periodic scheduling of meetings without the executives.

As part of the Board review process, each Board Committee undertook a review of its effectiveness.
The feedback and scores were positive. Each Committee considered the feedback from the evaluation
and agreed ‘actions. The Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee decided to increase the number and
length of meetings held annually to reflect the range and scope of legal and regulatory compliance
and risk management issues across a span of business lines. It also agreed that Non-Executive
Members of the Committee would hold separate meetings with the Head of Internal Audit
periodically. The Nominations Committee added a succession planning review to its-forward agenda
and the Remuneration Committee commissioned a report on the group remuneration framework and
the approvals process.

Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Statement

This Directors’ remuneration report for 2018/19, outlines the remuneration framework we've
followed over the past financial year and how we intend to improve on this going forward.

During a year in which conditions have continued to be very difficult on the UK’s high streets, with
many businesses retreating, the Post Office has made strong progress against the trend.

We have completed a major transformation our Network Transformation Programme that is helping
to keep Post Office branches at the heart of communities throughout the UK, with the business again
returning a profit to reinvest and reduce our reliance on taxpayers.

Taking the right steps for stability and sustainability in our network has been crucial to provide the
foundation from which to move forward. Our Chief Executive, Paula Vennells, who stepped down at
the end of April after 7 years, leaves a legacy of turning the business around from a £120 million
loss to a modernised, profitable organisation, thanks to her leadership and commitment. From the
strong position in which Paula left the company, the Group Executive continues to be energetically
focussed on responding to the challenges facing the business in an era of very fast-paced change.

2018/19 pay outcomes

The performance criteria used to determine both short-term and long-term incentives for the
2018/19 financial year were stretching as in previous years. The short-term incentive plan (“STIP”)
is based on a balanced scorecard of measures that ensures continued alignment with our business
strategy. The performance measures for the long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) continue to focus on
Post Office becoming a commercially sustainable business over time, measured predominantly by
financial results.

Our response to the UK Corporate Governance Code (2018)

Whilst not a legal requirement, in next year’s report we will carefully consider application of the UK
Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) to our policy and disclosures, to the extent that it is
relevant and practicable for Post Office. In this year’s report we have already taken some steps
towards application of the Code.

Shareholder engagement

Each year the Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) takes into account the views of BEIS.
The Committee communicates with BEIS on developments of the remuneration aspects of corporate
governance generally and any changes to the Company’s executive pay arrangements in particular.
All remuneration for the Executive Directors requires BEIS approval.

Implementation of this policy going forward

Over the next year, we intend to operate our policy as we have in previous years. The Committee is
confident that the current policy ensures that there continues to be a strong link between reward
and performance. This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Large and
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, to the extent that
they are applicable for Post Office in its capacity as an unlisted company.

Remuneration Policy

Summary of Remuneration Policy

The Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration packages for the Chief Executive Officer
(“CEO”) and Chief Finance and Operating Officer (“CFOO”) as well as determining the remuneration
policy for the Group Executive.

The Committee’s intention is that the remuneration policy aligns with the business strategy and risk
profile so that individuals are motivated to deliver the Post Office objectives and protect its value.
The Post Office remuneration strategy is based on the following:

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 21
POL00026927
POL00026927

« Attracting and retaining the right people within an agreed policy to lead and deliver the
strategic plan;
« Using incentives appropriately to reward the achievement of the turnaround strategy and

promote the long-term viability of the organisation;
« Reinforcing an emerging culture of mutual ways of working and partnership; and
e Providing a transparent approach to the disclosure of pay.

Membership of the Remuneration Committee

The Committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the Company’s policy on the remuneration of
Executive Directors, other members of the Group Executive and the Chairman of the Board. The
Committee determines the total remuneration packages and contractual terms and conditions for
these individuals. The Policy framework for remunerating all senior executive managers is consistent
with the approach taken for Executive Directors. The Committee also provides oversight of all
employee reward, for example the annual bonus scheme, and reviews cascade and alignment of
reward throughout the organisation. The Remuneration Committee Terms of Reference were updated
in October 2018. The members of the Committee are listed in the table below. All are independent
Non-Executive Directors, with the exception of the Company Chairman who was independent on his
appointment. During the year ended 31 March 2019, the Committee met six times to discuss key
remuneration issues arising, the review and operation of the Company’s Remuneration Policy and
market updates by its advisers.

The CEO attends the meeting by invitation of the Chairman and assists the Committee in its
deliberations, except in matters relating to their own remuneration. No Directors are involved in
deciding their own remuneration. The Committee also receives advice from the Group Human
Resources Director, along with other members of the Human Resources team and external
consultants.

External advisors

In the year under review, advice on matters related to executive remuneration was primarily
obtained from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”). PwC is a founding member of the Remuneration
Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in relation to Executive
Remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee has reviewed the operating processes in place
at PwC and whilst they are also our statutory auditors, they are satisfied that the advice that it
receives is objective and independent.

Fairness, diversity and wider workforce considerations

When making remuneration for the Executive Directors, we consider pay, policies and practices
elsewhere in the Group.

As part of our commitment to fairness, we have introduced this section which sets out more
information on our wider workforce pay conditions, our gender pay statistics, and our diversity policy.
Whilst we recognise there is much work still to do, we believe that transparency is an important first
step towards making improvements in relation to these important issues.

Engagement with the wider workforce

Employee engagement continues to be a focus for Post Office. Employee engagement rose by 13
percentage points to 51% in 2018 and a further 8 percentage point improvement has been reported
within the Retail division in March 2019. Over 90% of colleagues responded to the survey in 2018.

Going forward, our priority is improving management capability as a key driver of engagement. It is
important for each employee at the Post Office to understand the role they have to play in securing
a successful future for the business, and a line manager plays a key part in creating this
understanding.

We continue to encourage everyone to set goals which are aligned to business priorities. For 2019/20
we have a new leadership objective which every leader in the business will share and be measured
on, focused on performance delivery, and reinforcing the importance of offering coaching and
feedback that enables personal development for all colleagues.

The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee will be joining engagement champions at an event in
August 2019. This constitutes around 80 colleagues from across the business. One of the topics to
be addressed will be executive remuneration and how it aligns to the wider workforce.

Gender Pay gap reporting

Gender pay is not the same as equal pay. Equal pay is about ensuring men and women are paid the
same for work of equal value, as set out in the Equality Act 2010. At Post Office we support equal
pay through a robust job evaluation process that is free from gender bias.

The gender pay gap relates to the difference between the gross hourly pay of all men and the gross
hourly pay of all women across the organisation. The difference between gender pay and equal pay
is important to understand as you can have a gender pay gap without having equal pay issues. At
Post Office we recognise that more needs to be done to reduce the gender pay gap and we are
committed to doing so.

We continue to make progress. Our gender pay gap is 0.5% lower than last year, and smaller than
the UK average. We are closer to our goal of filling 50% of senior manager roles with women which
was 39% in our last report and is currently 42%. The number of women holding mid-level managerial
roles has risen by a third in the last year. We provide tailored coaching and mentoring for female
colleagues and run recruitment programmes to encourage more women to pursue careers in IT and
Finance. Our commitment has been recognised by The Times as we made their list of Top 50
Employers for Women for the third time.

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 26
POL00026927
POL00026927

Both our mean and median hourly gap has reduced, Our median gender pay gap is 7.9%, (as
compared with the national figure of 18.4%) and our mean gender pay gap is 17%. The main reason
for the gap is the lower proportion of women in senior roles relative to men. Another reason is part-
time working - 45% of female colleagues work part-time, compared with only 12% male colleagues.
This especially impacts the bonus pay gap.

. However, we are not complacent. There is still work to do‘to ensure women at Post Office realise
their potential. We are taking actions to reduce the gender pay gap further, such as continuing to
offer tailored mentoring to female colleagues and making sure we have 50/50 gender balanced
shortlists for senior level vacancies and our next graduate intake. Above all else, we continue to
listen to our colleagues and understand what they need to help them to flourish. We will use these
conversations, alongside the data contained in our full gender pay report, to improve again next
year. Because it is the right thing to do - for the future of Post Office and our people. For our full
gender pay report please see: http://corporate.postoffice.co,uk.

Diversity Policy

Our diversity and inclusion agenda has been a significant focus for us over the past year, We aspire
to provide a positive work environment. Employment decisions - whether related to recruitment,
promotions, transfers or terminations — are based on merit and fairness.

We have improved our reporting of diversity data and now have a clearer picture of where we stand
with regards to the diversity of [i] our workforce as a whole, [ii] our leadership team and [iii] our
pipeline of talent and promotion appointments. We are continuing to work on increasing the
disclosure rate of other diversity data, including sexual orientation and disability.

We also have gender diversity and ethnic diversity targets on our business scorecard relating to
representation at senior management level. Both targets are stretching and aim to have a leadership
team that is reflective of the customers and communities we serve by 2020 (50% female
representation and 14% BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues) representation at
leadership level by the end of 2019/20), Introducing this target has sent a clear message to our
leaders and colleagues in the business that gender diversity is not just a HR issue, but a business
imperative and helps to keep this issue on the agenda.

Other actions we have taken include:

¢ Being more demanding of our executive search firms. We insist on being provided
with gender balanced shortlists for senior roles to ensure that we are looking within the
widest possible pool of talent when recruiting new leaders into the business. This has
contributed to the increase we have seen in the representation of senior women in the
business to 42%. We are now aiming to broaden this to include greater ethnic diversity on
shortlists for leadership roles also.

» Placing greater emphasis on diverse talent pipelines for senior and executive
roles. Our Head of Talent is working with each group executive member to identify their
top talent and challenge where this is not a diverse list. As a result we have seen an
increase in the number of women promoted internally with 60% of our upward transfers in
the last year being women, and 24% of our upwards transfers being BAME colleagues.

« Working to create an inclusive culture, Diversity and inclusion is recognised as a strategic
priority by the business from the very top level. We reinforce the importance of diversity and
inclusion to all our people through profiling diverse role models; celebrating the diversity of
our people and marking awareness days; growing the number and impact of our employee
led diversity networks; and educating our people on the business impact of having diverse
and inclusive teams.

Management of Risk
Our Approach to Risk

The commercially competitive and highly regulated environment, together with operational
complexity, exposes the Post Office to a number of risks. We define risk as anything that can
adversely affect our ability to meet the Post Office’s objectives, maintain its reputation and comply
with regulatory standards. We seek to understand and harness risk in the pursuit of our objectives
and aim to operate within an acceptable level of risk taking. The Post Office has articulated its risk
appetite in relation to the most material risks with a view to managing better the key strategic risks
and assessing the risks in relation to new opportunities.

Risk Management Governance

The Board is accountable for risk management and internal controls in the Post Office, reviewing
their effectiveness and determining the nature and extent of principal risks. The Board has delegated
responsibilities to the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (“ARC”), which provides assurance to
the Board through review of reports from management, risk, internal audit external advisers and
external audit. Responsibility for day to day operations rests with the Group Executive. The Risk and
Compliance Committee (“RCC”) reviews the effectiveness of the risk management framework and
management of principal risks. The outputs are reported to the ARC as necessary.

Our Risk Management Framework

In order to deliver its objectives, the Post Office is required to identify, assess and manage a wide
range of risks. These are managed through an overarching framework in order to apply consistency
and transparency of risk management across the organisation. The framework identifies roles and
responsibilities of key parties in the risk management process, the policies for how risks are
managed, the tools and processes used and the reporting outputs that are generated.

The approach to risk management is based on the underlying principle of line management
accountability for effective implementation of internal controls to manage risk. The Group Executive
has identified and manages the principal risks in the organisation, focusing on the aims of the
strategic plan. These risks, with their response plans, are reviewed by the Central Risk team and at
the RCC and the ARC to assure the robustness of risk assessment and management. There is an
ongoing process of identifying, evaluating and managing the principal risks faced by Post Office.

During the year we have further improved our oversight over the level of risks being taken across
Post Office and effectiveness of our mitigating actions, including close monitoring of emerging risk
themes and incidents. Plans are also in place to fully refresh risk appetite to better inform decision
making. This is a component within our wider enhancement plan to continue maturing our Risk
Management framework.

Our Control Framework

We have an internal control framework in place for both our financial reporting and IT processes,
which fall under our self-assessment regime. In addition, we have implemented a suite of Post Office
policies which define the minimum control standards we expect to be performed within the applicable
business areas. Our risk management efforts are also underpinned by our Executives’ Declaration.

What has changed since last year?

Our principal risks evolve over time, as we progress with our strategy and drive to become a self-
sustaining company, new risks emerge and our mitigation activities adapt. Health and Safety has
become a new principal risk this year, reflecting the high importance we place on the safety of our
staff, colleagues and customers. Litigation is also new, due to the ongoing litigation involving the
Post Office. People is also a key focus, we recognise the need to attract, motivate, develop and retain
people with the right expertise to be successful. The level of risk has increased for Economic and
Political environment, in response to the ongoing political and economic uncertainty. Dependency on
strategic relationships remains a principal risk and is in an improving position. We have invested
considerably in Technology, Business Interruption and Cyber and residual risk is improving, although
the management and Board are not complacent to these risks. Both our Retail Proposition and
Regulatory Environment risks are stable. Our Retail Proposition remains fundamental to enabling us
to continue to successfully deliver our social purpose and the regulatory environment continues to
evolve and introducing new ways of doing business.

Our Principal Risks and Mitigations

These are our principal risks, detailed with their potential consequences if they were to crystallise
and how the Post Office manages them. Any of these risks could have a material impact on our
results, condition and prospects. However, these risks should not be regarded as a complete and
comprehensive statement of all potential risks; some risks are not yet known and some that are not
considered material could later turn out to be material. Our principal risks are regularly re-evaluated
and discussed at both a Board and GE level.

colleagues) and Return to Work (supporting colleagues returning to work after maternity,
other parental leave and long term absences).

° Proactively communicate that we are a Disability Confident Leader and actively try to

corporate careers page, recruitment agencies and other attraction channels such as
Vercida who are the world's leading diversity and inclusion employer brand platform.

. Ask all applicants to inform us of any reasonable adjustments we can make to ensure they
are not disadvantaged due to a particular disability during the selection process.

Training to ensure a consistent, fair and unbiased selection process takes place.

° Do not tolerate any form of bullying, harassment, victimisation or discrimination whether
written, verbal, visual or physical. We are committed to taking the necessary action to
ensure that they do not occur, or where they do occur that they are dealt with quickly and
eliminated, by following a consistent, fair and robust Bullying and Harassment Policy and
Procedure. All managers are required to complete Dignity at Work training to ensure they
understand their responsibilities and that they demonstrate the correct behaviours and
treat everyone with dignity and respect at all time.

Disabled employees

As noted above, the Post Office Limited has been recognised as a Disability Confident Leader. We
have a Disability Confidence networking group called ‘Be You’. This group provides support and
advice and helps the business to do the best it can for employees with disabilities. We also make
necessary adjustments for colleagues who are disabled or become disabled during the course of
their employment to allow them to carry out their role and fulfil their potential, including any
specific training needs.

Gender pay gap
Gender pay gap is detailed in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Statement on pages 26 to

Post balance sheet events

In accordance with the funding agreement with Government, Post Office Limited received a
Network Subsidy Payment of £18 million on 2 April 2019. The Network Subsidy Payment is
received on a quarterly basis and a total of £50 million will be received from Government in
2019/20.

Going concern

After analysis of the financial resources available and cash flow projections for Post Office Limited,
the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate that the financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis. Further details are provided in accordance with the
fundamental accounting concept in note 1 to the financial statements on page 48.

Financial Statements

Directors’ responsibilities statement

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulation.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial 53 week
period. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and
Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure
Framework”, and applicable law). In preparing the Group financial statements, the Directors have
also elected to comply with IFRSs, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of
the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing the financial statements,
the Directors are required to:

« select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

« state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and IFRSs issued by IASB
have been followed for the Group financial statements and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the Company financial statements,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

« make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

* prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the Group and Company will continue in business.

The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show
and explain the Group and Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ confirmations
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report is approved:

* so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group. and
Company’s auditors are unaware; and

« they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group and
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of
Post Office Limited

In our opinion:

¢ Post Office Limited’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the
“financial statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the
Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2019 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the 53 week
period (the “period”) then ended;

* the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;

« the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and

e the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report & Consolidated
Financial Statements (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the consolidated and Company
balance sheets as at 31 March 2019; the consolidated income statement and consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of cash flows, and the
consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity for the 53 week period then ended;
and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting
policies.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”)
and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence

We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements.

Conclusions relating to going concern
ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when:

e the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial
statements is not appropriate; or

e the Directors’ have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s and Company’s ability to
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months
from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

We have nothing to report in respect of the above matters.

However, because not ail future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a
guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. For example,
the terms on which the United Kingdom may withdraw from the European Union are not clear, and
it is difficult to evaluate all of the potential implications on the Group’s trade, customers, suppliers
and the wider economy.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Post Office Limited (continued)

Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other
information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated
in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement,
we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the
disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit,
ISAs (UK) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

Strategic Report and Directors’ Report

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in
the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the period ended 31 March 2019 is consistent with
the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic
Report and Directors’ Report.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 37, the
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to
liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Notes to the financial statements
1. Accounting Policies

Financial year
The financial year ends on the last Sunday in March and for this reason these financial statements
are made up for the 53 weeks ended 31 March 2019 (2018: 52 weeks ended 25 March 2018).

Basis of preparation

The Group financial statements on pages 41 to 84 have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and with
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. IFRS
interpretations are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and must be
adopted into European Law, referred to as endorsement, before they become mandatory under
the IAS regulation. Unless otherwise stated in the accounting policies below, the financial
statements have been prepared under the historic cost accounting convention.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated Financial
Statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years
presented, unless otherwise stated.

The Company is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Group consolidated financial
statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest £ million except
where otherwise indicated. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Post Office Limited is a private Company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales.

The income statement presents the results of the Group in a columnar format — in total and split
between trading and investments. The trading column represents the underlying performance of the
business. Investment funding from Government, restructuring and transformation costs are
separately disclosed in the investments column.

Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiary undertakings as at 31 March 2019. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of
acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until
the date such control ceases. A set of financial statements has been prepared for Post Office
Management Services Limited (subsidiary, registered address: Finsbury Dials, 20 Finsbury Street,
London, EC2Y 9AQ) for the 53 weeks ended 31 March 2019. A separate set of financial statements
has also been prepared for Payzone Bill Payments Limited (subsidiary, registered address: Finsbury
Dials, 20 Finsbury Street, London, EC2Y 9AQ), which was acquired on 24 October 2018, see note 20
for details.

The year-end dates of these subsidiaries are in line with the Company. The subsidiaries use
consistent accounting policies where appropriate and their results have been consolidated into the
Group financial statements. All intra-group balances, transactions, and unrealised gains and losses
resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full.

New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The Group applied IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 for the first time. The nature and effect of the changes as
a result of adoption of these new accounting standards are described below.

Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2018/19, but do not
have an impact on the financial statements of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any
standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective.

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 46
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 replaces the provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial
liabilities, derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge
accounting. The adoption of IFRS 9 from 2018/19 has not had a material impact on our results,
with the key issues for Post Office being around documentation of policies and new hedge
documentation.

IFRS 9 operates an expected credit loss model rather than an incurred credit loss model.
Providing for loss allowances on our existing financial asset has not had a material impact.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and related Interpretations
and it applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising from contracts with its customers.
IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with
customers and requires that revenue be recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration
to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a
customer.

The Group adopted IFRS 15 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. The standard
has not had a material impact on revenue recognition at Post: Office and therefore, on initial
application, no adjustment was required to the opening balance of retained earnings. Income
statement presentational reclassifications have been required in respect of the Network Subsidy
Payment and commission income relating to Government Services. These two items were
formerly recognised in revenue and have now been reclassified to other income as they did not
meet the recognition criteria from revenue under IFRS 15. Refer to page 9 for further details of
the reclassification. The accounting policies for revenue and for other income are on pages 49 to
51.

New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
IFRS 16 Leases

IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the
balance sheet by lessees, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under
the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals
are recognised. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.

The Group has set up a project team which has reviewed all of the Group’s leasing arrangements
over the last year in light of the new lease accounting rules in IFRS 16. The standard will affect
primarily the accounting for operating leases.

The Group will apply the standard from its mandatory adoption date - for Post Office this is from 1
April 2019. The Group intends to apply the simplified transition approach and will not restate
comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption, Right-of-use assets will be measured at the
amount of the lease liability on adoption (adjusted for any existing onerous and vacant lease
provisions). The Group therefore expects to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of
approximately £75-85 million on 1 April 2019. This range is before any adjustment for impairment.
The net pre-tax impact on the consolidated income statement will be minimal - an increase in
trading profit of some £5-10 million as there will no longer be a charge for operating leases,
matched by increases in depreciation, to recognise the usage of the new right-of-use assets, and
finance costs, to recognise the unwinding of the discount on the lease liability. There will be no
impact on the cash flows of the business.

The Group’s activities as a lessor are not material and hence the group does not expect any
significant impact on the financial statements.

The Group’s current lease commitments are disclosed in note 19.

POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

There are no other standards and interpretations in issue but not yet adopted that the Directors
anticipate will have a material effect on the reported income or net assets of the Group. The Group
has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not
yet effective.

Fundamental accounting concept — going concern

The Group has net assets of £244 million at 31 March 2019 (2018: £203 million), At 31 March 2019
£385 million of the Group’s working capital facility was undrawn (2018: £327 million). The Group has
also been profitable at a trading profit level with current year profit of £60 million (2018: £35 million)
and has shown a profit after tax of £40 million (2018: £17 million).

We have the following funding agreed with BEIS: a working capital facility of £950 million to 31
March 2021; a further £50 million facility available to provide same day liquidity to 4 April 2020;
Network Subsidiary Payment of £50 million for 2019/20 and 2020/21 respectively; and we also have
investment funding of up to £210 million available for the period from April 2018 to March 2020.
Investment funding of £168 million was received in 2018/19.

After careful consideration of the plans for the coming years, the Directors continue to believe that
Post Office will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the next 12 months. Accordingly, on
that basis, the Directors consider that it is appropriate that these financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting
policies
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and

assumptions are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors. In the
future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions.

In addition the Group has to make judgements in applying its accounting policies which affect the
amounts recognised in the financial statements. The most significant areas where judgements and
estimates are made are discussed below:

Critical accounting estimates:

Key assumptions used in impairment tests for non-current assets

The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-current assets at
each reporting date as well as if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may be impaired. Factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include the
following:

° Significant underperformance compared to historical or projected future operating results.

. Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall
Group.

° Significant negative micro- or macro-economic trends.

Where appropriate, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by
which the carrying value of the asset or cash generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of
assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by
management covering a two year period. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using
estimated growth rates. Refer to note 9 for the results of the latest impairment test, including
sensitivity analysis.

Actuarial assumptions
The costs, assets and liabilities of the pensions operated by the Group are determined using
methods relying on actuarial estimates and assumptions.

Post Office Limited corporate.postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 48
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

The pension figures are particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions for discount rates, mortality
and inflation rates. The Group exercises its judgement in determining the assumptions to be
adopted, after discussion with its Actuary and in accordance with published statistics and experience.
Refer to note 17 for details of the key assumptions and sensitivity analysis performed.

Pension liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and
discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of
equivalent currency and term. Judgement has been applied in determining that for these purposes a
high quality corporate bond constitutes AA rated or equivalent status bonds. .

Property provisions

The Group recognises provisions for property leases that are onerous. Assumptions are made to
determine whether the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations of a lease agreement exceed
the economic benefits expected to be received under it. These include estimates around the future
trading performance of the site and cost allocations.

Critical accounting judgements:

The recognition of a contingent liability in respect of the Group Litigation Order is a key accounting
judgement as at the accounting reference date. The key judgement is the level to which a potential
liability is deemed possible versus probable and therefore whether a contingent liability is the correct
accounting treatment. Refer to note 19 for further detail.

Revenue
The following revenue accounting policy relates to the prior year only.

Revenue from Retail, Financial Services and Telecoms comprises the value of services provided from
the Group’s principal activities in providing a whole range of services through its physical and digital
channels. Revenue from Financial Services and some Retail services comprises the commission
received, Revenue relating to line rental for telecoms services is recognised evenly over the period to
which the charges relate and revenue from calls is recognised at the time the call is made. Revenue
from all other transactions is recognised when the transaction is completed. All revenue is derived
wholly from within the United Kingdom,

Post Office Management Services revenue comprises the value of services provided from the
principal activities in providing insurance intermediary services through its network of Post Office
branches across the UK, online and contact centre channels.’Revenue comprises commissions
received from provision of the intermediary services excluding taxes. Revenue from all transactions
is recognised when the transaction is completed.

Revenue from contracts with customers
In 2018/19, the Group adopted IFRS 15.

Retail

The Group provides Mails support services to Royal Mail and Parcelforce. Each Mails product and
service has an associated transaction price. The transaction price may vary due to the volume
transacted in the period. Revenue from providing Mails support services is recognised in the
accounting period in which the services are rendered.

The Group acts as a selling agent and earns commission on the sale of lottery tickets, scratch cards
and gift vouchers. The transaction price is a contractual commission rate, which is based on the
value of sales in the period. Revenue from the sale of lottery tickets, scratch cards and gift vouchers
is recognised in the accounting period in which these sales are made.

Payment services comprise bill payments (including the subsidiary Payzone Bill Payments Limited).
The transaction price is the fee that the Group earns for each bill paid in a branch. Revenue from bill
payments is recognised in the accounting period in which the service is rendered and is based on the
transaction price multiplied by the volume of bill payments in the period.

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 49
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

Through the Banking Framework Agreement, the Group provides over-the-counter banking services,
such as withdrawals, deposits and balance enquiries, on behalf of banks. A transaction price is
associated with each banking service provided. Revenue is recognised in the accounting period in
which the services are rendered and is based on the transaction price multiplied by the volume of
each service provided in the period.

Identity Services

Identity services are provided under contract to Government departments, such as the DWP, DVLA
and the Home Office. Each Government service has an associated transaction price. Revenue is
recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered and is based on the
transaction price multiplied by the volume of each service provided in the period.

Financial Services & Telecoms

Our Financial Services products include mortgages, credit cards, savings, travel and banking. The
Group earns commission on the sale of these products. The transaction price is a contractual
commission rate. This commission rate varies by product and is based on volume or value of
products sold in the period as well as the channel of sale, for example online or through the branch
network. Revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which the new products are sold.

Telecoms includes Post Office HomePhone and Broadband services. The transaction price is the
subscription fee, consisting primarily of charges for access to broadband and other internet access or
voice services. Revenue is recognised as the service is provided because the customer receives and
uses the benefits simultaneously.

Insurance

Through its subsidiary, Post Office Management Services Limited, the Group provides general and
life insurance intermediation. The transaction price is a contractual commission rate. This
commission rate varies by product and is based on the volume or value of products sold in the
period as well as the channel of sale, for example online or through the branch network. Revenue is
recognised in the accounting period in which the new products are sold.

For all the revenue streams noted above, a receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered or
the services are provided, as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional, because
only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the
promised goods or services to the customer and the payment by the customer exceeds one year. As
a consequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction process for the time value of
money.

Accrued and deferred income

Income is accrued on the balance sheet for goods and services for which control has transferred to
the customer before consideration is due. Accrued income is reclassified as trade receivables when
the right to payment becomes unconditional and we have invoiced the customer.

Deferred income is recognised when we have received advance payment for goods and services that
we have not yet transferred to the customer.

Other income

The Network Subsidy Payment is received from Government and is recognised as other income to
match the related costs of making available the network of public Post Offices that the Secretary of
State for BEIS considers appropriate. The subsidy is recognised in the year in which it is received. If
the subsidy were to exceed the cost of making the network available, the excess would be repaid to
Government.

Other income also includes commission income relating to Government Services. This income, along
with the Network Subsidy Payment, was previously presented within revenue; however they do not

Post Office Limited corporate.postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 50
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

fall within the scope of IFRS 15. As a result these two items have been reclassified to other income,
as previously referenced on page 47.

Investments column in the income statement

Income statement items are presented in the investments column when they are significant in
size or nature, and either they do not form part of the underlying trading of the business or their
separate presentation enhances understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
Investment funding from Government, restructuring and transformation costs are separately
disclosed in the investments column. Investment funding is recognised at the point of receipt and
is received for transformational activities. Investment spend is presented within the investment
column to correspond with the investment funding to which it relates. Refer to note 4 for further
detail.

Exceptional items
Exceptional items are significant, one off items which require disclosure on their own on the
Income Statement.

Leases

Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are retained by the
lessor, are classified as operating leases and rentals are charged to the income statement over the
lease term. The aggregate benefit of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental expenses
over the lease term on a straight-line basis. A provision for dilapidations is made where necessary.
Refer to the provisions policy on page 54 and note 15 for further detail.

Taxation

The amount charged or credited as current income tax is based on the results for the year as
adjusted for items which are not taxed or are disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates in legislation
that has been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all taxable and deductible temporary
differences and unused tax assets and losses except:

- On the initial recognition of goodwill.

- On the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss.

- On the taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interest in
joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it
is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be
available against which they can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the
period when the tax asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly to equity. In this case, the tax is also
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Investments in joint ventures

Investments in joint ventures within the Group’s financial statements are accounted for under the
equity method of accounting. Under this method the investment is carried in the balance sheet at
cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture less any
impairment in value. The income statement reflects the Group’s share of post-tax profits from the
joint venture. The joint venture is an integral part of the Group’s operations.

POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

Business combinations

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The
consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated
as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities
incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the
Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit
or loss as incurred, within the investments column.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment excluding freehold property, long leaseho/d property and land:

Property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost, including attributable costs in bringing the
asset into working condition for its intended use. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the following useful lives:

Range of asset lives

Plant and machinery 3-15 years
Motor vehicles 3-12 years
Fixtures and equipment 3-15 years

Freehold property, long leasehold property and land:

As with other property, plant and equipment this is recognised at cost, including attributable costs in
bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. These assets have a long useful life
and a fair market value. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following useful lives:

Range of asset lives

Freehold land Not depreciated

Freehold buildings Up to 50 years

Long leasehold and short The shorter of the period of the lease, SO years or the estimated
leasehold buildings remaining useful life

The remaining useful lives of freehold buildings are reviewed periodically and adjusted where
applicable on a prospective basis. Where freehold property and long leasehold includes the fit-out of
those properties, then the fit-out is depreciated over its useful economic life in line with fixtures and
fittings.

Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, with depreciation charged on the same basis
as all other assets once those assets are ready for their intended use.

Intangible assets

Goodwill:

Goodwill is initially recognised at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration
transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held,
over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, goodwill is
recognised at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The Group’s management undertakes an
impairment review annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Software:

Costs associated with maintaining software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following
criteria are met:

. it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use

. management intends to complete the software and use or sell it

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 52
POL00026927

POL00026927
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
° there is an ability to use or sell the software
° it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits
. adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or
sell the software are available, and
° the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software include employee costs and an
appropriate portion of relevant overheads.

Capitalised development costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortised from the point at
which the asset is ready for use.

Research and development:

Research expenditure and development expenditure that does not meet the criteria above are
recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are
not recognised as an asset in subsequent periods.

Intangible assets with a finite useful life:
Intangible assets acquired separately or generated internally are initially recognised at cost. They
are amortised on a straight-line basis over the following useful lives:

Range of asset lives

Software 3 - 6 years
Customer relationships 5 years
Merchant relationships 5 - 10 years
Brands 15 years

Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, with amortisation commencing once the
assets are ready for their intended use.

Inventories
Inventories include stationery and Royal mint coin products and are carried at the lower of cost and
net realisable value after adjusting for obsolete or slow-moving stock.

Trade receivables

Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount. An allowance is made
when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. The Group applies IFRS 9 to measure
this allowance for expected credit loses, grouping trade receivables based on shared risk
characteristics and days past due. Bad debts are written off when identified.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and on hand, including cash
in the Post Office network and short-term deposits (cash equivalents) with an original maturity date
of three months or less. Cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivable financial
instruments.

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash
equivalents as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.

The subsidiaries Post Office Management Services Limited and Payzone Bill Payments Limited hold
some fiduciary cash balances, these are held on trust on behalf of third parties, see note 12 for
details.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
Membership of occupational pension schemes is open to most permanent UK employees of the
Group.

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 53
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

The Group is the principal employer of the Post Office Section of the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP),
and is a participating employer within the Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan (RMSEPP).
RMPP and RMSEPP are both defined benefit plans closed to new members and closed to future
accrual. All members of these plans are contracted out of the earnings-related part of the State
pension scheme.

A Memorandum of Understanding was executed in 2016/17 which removed the unconditional right to
refund from the RMPP. As a result of these events the surplus relating to this Plan was derecognised.

The pension assets of the defined benefit schemes are measured at fair value. Liabilities are
measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate
equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and
term.

Full actuarial funding valuations are carried out at intervals not normally exceeding three years as
determined by the Trustees and actuarial valuations are carried out at each balance sheet date and
form the basis of the surplus or deficit disclosed. When the calculation at the balance sheet date
results in net assets to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future
refunds of the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan (the asset ceiling). As noted
above, the RMPP Plan has been closed and no future refunds will be made to the Group.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Any deferred tax movement associated with the actuarial gains and losses is also recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income. As the Group has no right to a future surplus in the RMPP, an
equal and opposite adjustment to the asset ceiling is recognised in other comprehensive income.
There is no effect on the net assets position of the Group.

For defined contribution schemes, the Group’s contributions are charged to operating profit, as part
of staff costs, in the period to which the contributions relate.

Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of the Group is sterling (£).

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result
of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation,
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Due to the nature of provisions
the future amount settled may be different from the amount that has been provided. If the effect of
the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future
cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax rate.

Financial instruments

Initial measurement of financial instruments

All financial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a
financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.

Subsequent measurement of financial assets
IFRS 9 divides all financial assets into two classifications - those measured at amortised cost and
those measured at fair value.

Where assets are measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recognised entirely in profit
or loss (fair value through profit or loss, “FVTPL”), or recognised in other comprehensive income
(fair value through other comprehensive income, “FVTOCI)”.

The classification of a financial asset is made at the time it is initially recognised. If certain
conditions are met, the classification of an asset may subsequently need to be reclassified.

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 54
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities
IFRS 9 divides all financial liabilities into two measurement categories: FVTPL and amortised
cost. All of the Group’s financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.

Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised when the Group determines that it has transferred substantially
all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when it is extinguished; that is, when the
obligation specified in the contract is either discharged or cancelled or expires.

Derivatives and hedging activities

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that a derivative contract is entered
into, and they are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting
period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group
designates certain derivatives as either:

¢ Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value
hedges).

e Hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities
and highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges).

e Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges).

At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between
hedging instruments and hedged items, including whether changes in the cash flows of the
hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The
Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge
transactions.

The fair values of derivative financial instruments designated in hedge relationships are disclosed
in note 16. Movements in the hedging reserve are shown within other reserves in the statement
of changes in equity. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current
asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months; it is
classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less
than 12 months.

Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as
cash flow hedges is recognised in other reserves within equity. The gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or
non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included
in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If a hedge of a
forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial
liability, the associated gains or losses that were previously recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income are reclassified into the income statement in the same period or periods
during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement.

Restructuring: Restructuring costs are transformational spend incurred in order to implement the
major transformation programmes. Business transformation is an overarching programme that will
transform the business, driving Post Office toward commercial sustainability through technological
innovation and the fundamental re-envisaging of long-term contracts. Network programmes is a
multi-year initiative designed to simplify the retailer proposition, with key areas of focus being
simplification, automation and the extension of the franchising model to some of our directly
managed branches. IT transformation includes programmes to restructure our IT operating model
and overhaul legacy back office systems, transitioning to a cloud based architecture. As part of the
aforementioned transformational activities, severance costs have been incurred.

Unwinding of discounts on provisions: finance costs incurred in order to unwind the discount on
onerous lease provisions.

7. Taxation credit
(a) Taxation recognised in the year
Current and deferred income tax is credited to the income statement as follows:
2019 2018
£m £m
Current income tax:
Corporation tax credit for year (8) (8)
Deferred income tax:
Deferred tax income relating to the utilisation of losses brought forward (1) (1)
Taxation credit (9) I (9)

The current income tax credit recognised in the income statement is £8 million (2018: £8 million)
and relates to the surrender of tax losses to the joint venture. The deferred income tax credit
recognised in the income statement is £1 million (2018: £1 million) and arises as a consequence of
the acquisition of intangible assets as part of a business combination. It corresponds to the deferred
tax liability recognised in the business combination.

In the current year no deferred income tax has been recognised in other comprehensive income.
No current or deferred tax income tax was recognised directly in equity in the current or prior year.
(b) Factors affecting current tax credit on profit

As in 2018, the tax assessed for the year differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK
of 19% (2018: 19%). The differences are explained below:

2019 2018

In the current year a deferred tax liability of £2 million (2018: £1 million) has been recognised on
the acquisition of intangible assets as part of a business combination, with a corresponding deferred
tax asset of £2 million (2018: £1 million) recognised for the value losses up to the same liability.

The Group has significant tax losses that are available indefinitely for offsetting against future
taxable profits. As at the balance sheet date no deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to
these tax losses (2018: £nil).

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 59
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

(d) Factors that may affect future tax charges

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £183 million (2018: £190 million), comprising
£150 million (2018: £143 million) relating to tax losses that are available to offset against future
taxable profits, £32 million (2018: £46 million) relating to fixed asset timing differences and £1
million (2018: £1 million) relating to temporary differences on provisions. The Group has rolled over
capital gains of £2 million (2018: £2 million); no tax liability would be expected to crystallise should
the assets into which the gains have been rolled be sold at their residual value, as it is anticipated
that a capital loss would arise.

The main rate of corporation tax in the UK will remain at 19% for the year starting 1 April 2019 and
reduce to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.

The Finance (No.2) Act 2017 was substantively enacted on 16 November 2017. This includes a
restriction on the utilisation of brought forward tax losses and corporate interest in certain
circumstances effective from 1 April 2017.

Included within the above table are assets under construction of £59 million (2018: £137 million).
Other intangibles includes customer relationships, merchant relationships and brands.

During the current and priof year, a review of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
took place and resulted in reclassifications between categories.

Additions to software relate to IT transformation projects undertaken during the current year.

Additions to goodwill and other intangibles relate to the Payzone Bill Payments Limited (“Payzone”)
business combination disclosed within note 20. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Management determined that no impairment was necessary for the current year (2018:
Enil).

Goodwill was not considered to be impaired at the date of the last review. Refer to note 9 for details
of the impairment review performed during the year.

Amortisation rates are disclosed on page 53 within the accounting policies note.

Depreciation rates are disclosed on page 52 within the accounting policies note. No depreciation is
provided on freehold land, which represents £2 million (2018: £2 million) of the total cost of
properties.

During the current and prior year, reviews of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
took place and resulted in reclassifications between categories to give a more appropriate
representation of the nature of the assets.

An impairment test was performed during the year. Intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment were tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each Cash
Generating Unit (CGU) with the recoverable amount determined from value in use calculations.

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 62
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

Post Office has determined that it has two CGUs: Post Office Limited and Post Office Management
Services Limited. Post Office Management Services Limited is a standalone entity with an
identifiable asset base and therefore is deemed one CGU. Post Office Limited runs a national
network of branches which provide a distinct retail offering resulting in a fluid customer base
across the network. As such the network as a whole is deemed to be one CGU.

The discounted net cash flows from the value in use calculations were used to determine the
recoverable amount of the CGU’s identified, being Post Office Limited and Post Office
Management Services Limited. Value in use is determined using the Group’s net cash inflows
from the continued use of the assets within each CGU over a two year period (and then
continued into perpetuity), with no nominal growth rate assumed outside of this period. Pre-tax
discount rates for Post Office Limited of 9.5% (2018: 9%) and for Post Office Management
Services Limited of 12% (2018: 12%) have been used to discount the forecasted cash flows.

A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the value in use of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets. This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered
to be possible by management. This included an increase in the discount rate of up to 12%, zero
growth rate and a decrease in forecasted EBITDA by 5%. The sensitivity analysis showed that no
impairment would arise under each or a combined scenario.

Management therefore believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions
would not cause the carrying amount of any CGU’s to exceed their carrying value.

The loan under the facility is short dated on a programme of liquidity management and matures 1
day after the year-end (2018: 1 day). The fair value of borrowings approximate their carrying value
due to the short term maturities of the loan. On maturity it is expected that further loans will be
drawn down under this facility, which expires in 2021. The undrawn committed facility, in respect of
which all conditions precedent had been met at the balance sheet date, is £385 million (2018: £327
million). The average interest rate on the drawn down loans is 1.1% (2018: 0.8%).

The facility is currently restricted to funding the cash and near cash items held within the Post Office
Limited network.

The facility (including drawn down loans) is secured by a floating charge over all assets of Post Office
Limited and a negative pledge over cash and near cash items. The negative pledge is an agreement
not to grant security over the assets or to set up a vehicle that has the same effect.

The Group has recognised provisions where a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a
result of a past event, where it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.

The Network Programmes provision relates to payments due to postmasters in relation to the major
transformation programme. Provisions are recognised when either postmasters agree to terminate
their existing contracts or sign the new format contracts under Network Transformation.

Property provisions relate to vacant and onerous leases and dilapidations. Vacant and onerous lease
provisions are recognised on leasehold properties when the unavoidable costs of meeting the
obligations of the lease agreement exceed the benefits expected to be received under it.

Severance provisions are recognised for business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently
detailed and well advanced and where appropriate communication to those affected has been

undertaken at the balance sheet date.

Other provisions of £10 million includes £1 million for personal injury claims and £2 million which sits
within the subsidiary Post Office Management Services Limited and relates to the repayment of
commission received in the event of the cancellation of insurance policies.

16. Financial assets and liabilities

a. Financial assets and liabilities by category

The breakdown of the Group’s financial instruments at 31 March 2019 and 25 March 2018 is shown
below:

2019 2018
Non - Non -
Current current Total Current current Total
é£m —£m £m £m £m £m
Financial assets
Trade and other receivables 320 2 322 307 2 309

Trade and other payables (516) (3) (519) (531) (4) (535)
BEIS loan (565) - (565) (623) - (623)
Total financial liabilities (189) qa (190) (192) (2) (194)

Except for prepayments, social security and deferred income, which have been excluded from the
table above, all of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities by nature and classification for
measurement purposes are considered loans and receivables.

The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying value due to
the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is
defined as the amount at which the Group would expect to receive upon selling an asset or pay to
transfer a liability in a transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

All of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are considered to be Level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy. The nature of the inputs used in determining the values of the financial assets and
liabilities are those other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

The Group has no Level 1 and Level 3 financial instruments and there have been no transfers
between the levels of fair value hierarchy during the period.

b. Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk and
interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and aims to minimise potential adverse effects
on the Group’s financial performance.

Interest rate risk

The Group is exposed to changes in interest rate on floating rate debt, cash deposits, current
account balances, and commission income. Interest rate risk on borrowings is managed through
determining the right balance of fixed and floating debt within the financing structure. Market
conditions are considered when determining the desired balance of fixed and floating rate debt. Had
there been a 50 basis point increase in interest rates, there would have been an £7 million
favourable impact on the Group’s equity and income statement. A 50 basis point decrease would
have resulted in a £7 million adverse impact on the Group's equity and income statement.

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 69
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

In 2018/19, to hedge its exposure to the variability of commission income linked to 1-month Libor,
the Group entered into a three year amortising interest rate swap which has the effect of fixing a
proportion of the interest commission income. The qualifying criteria for hedge accounting were met
and in accordancé with IFRS 9 the swap was designated as the hedging instrument in a cash flow
hedge. At year end, the hedging instrument had a fair value of £3 million and has been included
within trade and other receivables on the balance sheet.

Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk resulting from balances held to operate Bureau de
Change services.

The currencies in which these transactions are primarily denominated are US dollar and Euro. The
Group’s foreign currency risk management objective is to minimise the impact on the Income
Statement of fluctuations in the exchange rates. The Group hedges its foreign currency risk
principally through external forward foreign currency contracts to cover near-term future revenues
with a number of providers including First Rate Exchange Services Holdings Limited.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial instruments to a reasonably possible
change in the US dollar and Euro exchange rates, assuming they are unhedged and with all other
variables held constant, on profit before tax and equity.

(10) (1) Q) (10) (3) (3)

Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in
financial loss to the Group. Financial credit risk arises from cash balances (including bank deposits
and cash and cash equivalents) held by the Group and business credit risk arises from exposures to
customers. Business risk includes commission receivable and client related settlements for amounts
paid out of the Post Office network on their behalf.

The Group aims to minimise its financial credit risk through the application of risk management
policies approved by the Board. Counterparties are limited to major banks and financial institutions.
The policy restricts the exposure to any one counterparty by setting appropriate credit limits. The
maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying value of each class of asset summarised
in note 11.

Business credit risk is monitored centrally. The level of bad debt provision is 2% (2018: less than
2%) of revenue.

Capital management

The Group's objectives when managing capital (defined as the net of borrowings and cash and cash
equivalents excluding cash in the Post Office Network) are to safeguard its ability to continue as a
going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to support the business and
maximise stakeholder value. In managing the Group’s capital levels the Board and the Group
Executive regularly monitor the level of debt in the Group, the working capital requirements and the
forecast cash flows. The Board and Group Executive plan accordingly following this review process in
order to meet the Group’s capital management objectives.

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 70
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

Liquidity risk

The Group's primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its
financial obligations as they fall due. This is achieved by aligning short-term investments and
borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows. Typical short-term investments include short term bank
deposits with approved counterparties. Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed to ensure
continuity of funding.

The Group has adequate cash reserves to meet operating requirements in the next 12 months.

At 31 March 2019 the Group has unused facility of £385 million (2018: £327 million). The working
capital facility expires in 2021.

In addition to the security interest provided to BEIS in connection with the £950 million Working
Capital Facility (note 14), Post Office Limited has also created a first floating charge over its
assets as security for the payment and discharge of certain liabilities arising in the normal course
of its client-related activity. The charge under these arrangements is restricted in its ability to
take an acceleration action in relation to its debt. As at the balance sheet date the outstanding
liabilities amounted to £95 million (2018: £100 million).

The tables below analyse the Group’s financial assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings
based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The
amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and include interest,
where applicable.

17. Retirement benefit surplus

The disclosures in this note reflect the two defined benefit schemes: the Post Office section of the
Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) which is independent from the Royal Mail section of the RMPP,
and a 7% share of the Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan (RMSEPP). Royal Mail Group Ltd
is the principal employer of RMSEPP and Post Office Limited became a participating employer
with effect from 1 April 2012. This disclosure also includes the Post Office Pension Plan (POPP),
which is a defined contribution scheme.

The disclosures in this note show the value of the assets and liabilities that have been calculated
at the balance sheet date.

Post Office participates in pension schemes as detailed below.

Name Eligibility Type

Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP)* UK employees Defined benefit
Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan (RMSEPP) UK senior executives Defined benefit
Post Office Pension Plan (POPP) UK employees Defined contribution

*The RMPP closed to future accrual on 31 March 2017.

Defined Contribution

The charge in the income statement for the defined contribution scheme was £13 million (2018:
£17 million) and the Group contributions to this scheme were £20 million (2018: £20 million)
during the year.

Defined Benefit

Both RMPP and RMSEPP are funded by the payment of contributions to separate Trust
administered funds. It should be noted that the assumptions used for these pension disclosures
are not the same as the assumptions used for funding the plans. The latest full actuarial funding
valuation of the RMPP is currently being finalised and will be carried out as at 31 March 2018
using the projected unit method. The previous RMPP valuation, as at 31 March 2015, concluded
at a £63 million surplus on a Technical Provisions basis. Valuations are carried out triennially.

RMPP includes sections A, B and C each with different terms and conditions:

« Section A is for members (or beneficiaries of members) who joined before 1 December
1971.

e Section B is for members (or beneficiaries of members) who joined after 1 December
1971 and before 1 April 1987 or to Section A members who chose to receive Section B
benefits.

e Section C is for members (or beneficiaries of members) who joined after 1 April 1987 and
before 1 April 2008.

The latest full actuarial funding valuation for RMSEPP was carried out as at 31 March 2018 using
the projected unit method. For 100% of RMSEPP, the valuation concluded at £49 million surplus
(31 March 2015 valuation: £17 million surplus) on a Technical Provisions basis.

A series of changes to RMPP and RMSEPP have taken effect since 1 April 2008.
The changes encompassed are:

¢ The Plans closed to new members from 31 March 2008.

« All pensions and benefits earned before 1 April 2008 retained a link to final pensionable
salary, benefits accrued from 1 April 2008 were earned on a “career average pensionable
salary” basis.

« RMPP employees can continue to take their pension on reaching age 60 but the normal
retirement age increased to age 65 for benefits earned from 1 April 2010.

« From 1 April 2010 it was possible to draw pension earned before the change to normal
retirement age at age 55 (subject to an actuarial reduction in the pension benefit), and
continue working while still contributing to the RMPP until the maximum level of benefits
was reached.

« RMSEPP was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2012.

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 72
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

* Liabilities accrued in the RMPP to 31 March 2012 were largely transferred to the Royal
Mail Statutory Pension Scheme. The pre-31 March 2012 liabilities are substantially no
longer an obligation of Post Office and the transfer therefore resulted in a significant
removal of pension risk for Post Office.

e Inrelation to RMPP only, from 1 April 2014 pensionable salary was amended to the
amount in force as at 31 March 2014, increasing each 1 April thereafter in line with RPI
(up to 5% each year), with allowance for certain promotional increases.

¢ The Post Office section of the RMPP closed to future accrual on 31 March 2017 and so no
further defined benefits have accrued in respect of Post Office employment after that
date; however for as long as a member remains in employment with the Group or has not
taken pension, pre-1 April 2012 pension benefits are linked to pensionable salary and
post-31 March 2012 benefits receive in-deferment increases (linked to CPI). Closure to
future accrual means that no contributions in respect of normal service accrual are
required after 31 March 2017. However there were redundancy payments of £1 million
(2018: £5 million) made to the RMPP during 2018/19, which were paid in order to fund
enhanced benefits for the members concerned.

e On 21 March 2017 Post Office executed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Trustee
of the RMPP. This clarified the Trustee’s powers to distribute surplus without Post Office’s
agreement and Post Office concluded that it no longer had an unconditional right to
refund from the Plan. In light of this, in accordance with IFRIC 14, the RMPP pension
surplus was derecognised as at 26 March 2017.

Even though RMSEPP had a funding surplus on a Technical Provisions basis at the date of the
latest full actuarial funding valuation, under the associated Schedule of Contributions, payments
of £1 million per annum has been made. Post Office’s share of these payments is 7% of the total.
The payments will continue to 31 March 2025.

The weighted average duration of the Post Office section of the RMPP is around 25 years, and for
RMSEPP is around 20 years.

In July 2017 the Trustee of the RMPP invested in two bulk annuity policies with Rothesay Life.
Those policies provide an income to the Post Office section of the RMPP that matches the vast
majority of the required benefit payments; as shown in the following disclosures, the estimated
value of those policies (on the IAS 19 assumptions as at 31 March 2019) is £292 million (2018:
£272 million), compared to the RMPP defined benefit obligation of £320 million (2018: £298
million). The £28 million difference in these figures is due to a £20 million reserve for future
administration expenses (which are not matched by the annuity policies), plus £8 million in
respect of small differences between the insured benefits and the actual benefit obligation.

A bulk annuity policy (with Scottish Widows) is also held by the Trustee of the RMSEPP. As shown
in the following disclosures, the estimated value of that policy, on the IAS 19 assumptions as at
31 March 2019, is £28 million (2018: £12 million), compared to the RMSEPP defined benefit
obligation of £29 million (2018: £27 million).

Therefore, as at 31 March 2019, 92% of the aggregate defined benefit obligation (i.e. £320
million out of the £349 million) is matched by bulk annuities that provide income matching the
required benefit payments. As such, the majority of the investment and longevity risk associated
with Post Office’s obligations in respect of the defined benefit plans has been removed (noting
that the bulk annuity policies are subject to protection from insurance regulations, including
access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, in the event of insurer insolvency).
Nevertheless, to the extent that 8% of the defined benefit obligation is not matched by bulk
annuities, some risk remains in respect of that 8%, in particular the risk that members with
uninsured benefits live for longer than expected, the risk that inflation is higher than expected,
leading to higher than expected increases to the uninsured benefits, the risk that the assets in
excess of the bulk annuity polices generate poor investment returns, and the risk that
administration expenses are higher than anticipated. However, these risks are expected to be
mitigated by the surplus assets shown in the disclosures (before allowing for the fact that the
RMPP surplus is not recognised on Post Office’s balance sheet due to the Memorandum of
Understanding described above).

The following disclosures relate to the gains/losses and surplus/deficit in respect of Post Office's
obligations to RMPP and RMSEPP: .

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

a) Major long-term assumptions

The size of the defined benefit obligation shown in the financial statements is materially sensitive
to the assumptions adopted. Small changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact
on this value. The overall! income statement charge and past service adjustment in the income
statement are also sensitive to the assumptions adopted. However, the majority of any change in
the defined benefit obligation due to changes in assumptions, will be matched by a corresponding
change in the value in the bulk annuity policies (described above).

The major long-term assumptions in relation to both RMPP and RMSEPP were:
At 31 March 2019 At 26 March 2018

% pa % pa
Increases to benefits that retain a link to pensionable pay 3.4 3.3
Rate of pension increases ~ RMPP sections A/B 2.4 2.2
Rate of pension increases - RMPP section C 3.4 3.3
Rate of pensions increases - RMSEPP members transferred 2.4 2.2
from Section A or B of RMPP
Rate of pension increases - RMSEPP all other members 3.4 3.3
Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.4 2.2
Discount rate 2.4 2.5
Inflation assumption (RPI) - RMPP & RMSEPP_ 3.4 3.3
Inflation assumption (CPI) - RMPP_& RMSEPP. 2.4 2.2

The following table shows the potential impact on the value of Post Office’s defined benefit
obligation in respect of RMPP and RMSEPP of changes in key assumptions. As noted above, the
bulk annuities held by the arrangements provide an income that matches the vast majority of the
RMPP benefit payments, and a significant proportion of the RMSEPP benefit payments. Therefore
the following changes in the defined benefit obligation would be largely offset by a corresponding
change in the asset values.

2019 2018

Changes in discount rate of +0.1% pa 8 8
Changes in CPI assumptions of +0.1% pa 3 (3)
An additional one year life expectancy 11 (9)

The sensitivity analysis has been prepared using projected benefit cash flows as at the latest full
actuarial valuation of the plan. The same method was applied as at the previous reporting date.
The accuracy of this method is limited by the extent to which the profiles of the plan cash flows

have changed since those valuations although any change is not expected to be material in the

context of the above sensitivity analysis.

Mortality: The mortality assumptions used to calculate the value of Post Office’s defined benefit
obligation in respect of RMPP and RMSEPP are based on the latest self-administered pension
scheme (SAPS “S2” series) mortality tables as shown in the following table:

Base mortality tables 2019 2018
Male members 100% x S2PMA 100% x S2PMA

*As described above, RMSEPP holds a bulk annuity policy with Scottish Widows. The value ascribed to this
policy has been calculated using the same assumptions as used to calculate the present value of the defined
benefit obligation.

As described above, no surplus is recognised for RMPP because the Group no longer has an
unconditional right to refund from the Plan. A retirement benefit surplus of £1 million is disclosed
on the balance sheet, representing the surplus in the RMSEPP only.

There is no element of the above present value of liabilities that arises from plans that are wholly
unfunded. With the exception of the bulk annuity policy described above, all RMPP and RMSEPP
assets are securities with a quoted price in an active market.

Contingent liabilities: As a large, nationwide retailer operating in dynamic and competitive markets,
we may be subject to regulatory investigations and may face damage to our reputation and legal
claims.

From time to time, we may be named as a defendant in legal claims or be required to respond to
regulatory actions in connection with our activities. This may include claims for substantial or
indeterminate amounts of damages from customers, employees, consultants and contractors, or
may result in penalties, fines, or other results adverse to us. Like any large company, we may also
be subject to the risk of potential employee or postmaster misconduct, including non-compliance
with policies and improper use or disclosure of our assets or confidential information.

On 11 April 2016, a High Court claim was issued on behalf of a number of postmasters against Post
Office in relation to various legal, technical and operational matters, many of which have been the
subject of significant external focus for a number of years.

The litigation is very complex and the Judge ordered that it will be heard as a series of trials.

The first trial, which finished on 5 December 2018, was about determining the legal construction of
the contract between Post Office and postmasters. The Judgment from this trial was made public on
15 March 2019.

On 23 May 2019, the Court awarded the Claimants their costs in respect of the first trial. As a result,
Post Office was instructed to make a payment on account of £6 million. These costs have been
recognised in 2018/19 as they reflect conditions that existed at the end of this reporting period.

The second trial, about technical matters concerning Post Office’s Horizon computer system started
on 11 March 2019 and concluded on 2 July 2019 when the Judge retired to consider his judgment.
The judgment is not expected to be handed down before mid-September 2019.

Neither the first nor second trial have or will determine liability or the individual claimants’ cases. A
further third trial has been scheduled for March 2020, but the fourth trial has not yet been set down.

Further, a number of the Claimants assert that they have been convicted of criminal offences
arising from their roles at Post Office, with 31 of those cases being considered by the Criminal
Cases Review Commission (“CCRC”). The CCRC has the power to refer cases to the Court of
Appeal who, in turn, have the power to overturn a conviction. This could then lead to claims for
compensation.

To date, the Claimants have not asserted the aggregate value of their claims in any of the Particulars
of Claim filed in the litigation.

While the Directors recognise that an adverse outcome would be material, they are currently unable
to determine whether the outcome of these proceedings would have a material adverse impact on
the consolidated position of the Group, and are unlikely to be able to do so until the Court has made
further determinations and the Claimants have provided the necessary information about the value
of their claims. The Directors continue to keep this under close review.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

The Post Office Group Litigation represents a possible obligation arising from past events, whose
existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future
events not wholly within the control of the Group.

The costs of £20 million included in exceptional items relate to Post Office defending the Post Office
Group Litigation (2018: £3 million) during the financial year.

On 14 June 2018, an Employment Tribunal claim was issued on behalf of a number of postmasters
against Post Office in which they seek to establish that they are "workers" of Post Office and therefore
have rights to holiday pay.

Post Office's position is that postmasters are independent contractors in business on their own
account, not workers, and this is supported by previous case law. However, if postmasters were to
establish they are workers they would gain a number of additional rights such as to take and be paid
for annual leave and a right to receive the National Minimum Wage/National Living Wage. This would
likely result in future increased business costs and retrospective claims for compensation.

The litigation is at a relatively early stage. Post Office and the Claimants are currently going through
a process of agreeing ‘test cases’. It is anticipated that this process will be complete by 11 October
2019.

On 11 October 2019 there will be a hearing, which will set a date for a future preliminary hearing to
decide whether or not the Claimants have worker status. No date has been set for that hearing but
Post Office does not expect it to take place prior to April 2020.

That first hearing will only determine the legal principle of whether postmasters (or some categories
of postmaster) are workers. Should the Claimants succeed on this point, a further trial will be
required to decide the value of their quantum of their claims. No date has been set for this at present.

To date, the Claimants have not asserted the value of their claims.

This litigation represents a possible obligation arising from past events, whose existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not
wholly within the control of the Group.

While the Directors recognise that an adverse outcome could be material, they are currently unable
to determine whether the outcome of these proceedings would have a material adverse impact on
the consolidated position of the Group, and are unlikely to be able to do so until the Employment
Tribunal has determined the worker status question and the Claimants have provided the necessary
information about the value of their claims. The Directors continue to keep this under close review.

20. Business combinations

On 24 October 2018, the Group acquired Payzone Bill Payments Limited (“Payzone”) for cash
consideration of £16 million. Further consideration of £3 million is contingent on the future
performance of certain Payzone revenue streams. £1 million has been paid as at 31 March 2019. The
acquisition developed the bill payments business and has been accounted for under IFRS 3 Business
Combinations.

The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the business as at the date of acquisition
were:

The goodwill arising from the acquisition represents the opportunity to integrate technology and
combine the Group’s existing bill payments business with Payzone in order to compete for new and
bigger bill payment contracts from a stronger position. The goodwill arising on acquisition is not
deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill has been reviewed for impairment at acquisition and
during the year and on both occasions the amount is considered to represent fair value. There are no
indicators of impairment.

Associated acquisition expenses were immaterial and have been charged to the income statement,
within the investments column.

From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2019, the Payzone business has contributed £4 million of
revenue and £1 million to trading profit.

22. Membership of the Bank of England's Note Circulation
Scheme

Post Office Limited is a member of the Bank of England (the ‘Bank’) Note Circulation Scheme (the
‘NCS’) which governs the custody of Bank of England notes that are not in issue. The NCS promotes
efficiency in the distribution and processing of notes by allowing approved commercial organisations,
engaged in the wholesale distribution and processing of cash, such as the Post Office, to hold notes
owned by the Bank.

The continued participation in the NCS ensures that Post Office Limited has an adequate supply of
notes to meet customer demand across its network.

The NCS mechanisms that enable Post Office Limited to hold Bank of England owned notes comprise
of two elements:

Bond Facility Cash (the ‘Bond’) - this is cash that is permanently owned by the Bank and is stored in
secure vaults at our cash centres, physically separate from other cash. Post Office Limited buys cash
from and sells cash to the Bond.

Note Recirculation Facility Cash (the ‘NRF’) - this is cash that is held securely, either in our NCS cash
centres or in the branch network and that is sold to the Bank at the end of each day with a
commitment from Post Office Limited to buy it back the next morning. In order to sell notes in this
way to the Bank, Post Office Limited must ensure that Gilts are lodged each night as collateral. Our
ability to sell notes to the Bank under the NRF is constrained by:

a) The amount of eligible notes available for sale.

b) The collateral available.

c) An annual limit imposed by the Bank dependent upon the volume of notes sorted and issued

from our cash centres.

In order to support its participation in the NCS, Post Office Limited has bank facilities of up to £400
million in place (the ‘Facilities’), comprising:

a) An overnight collateral facility.
b) An intra-day overdraft facility.

The Facilities may be cancelled by the lender with 60 days’ notice.
At the end of the year £227 million (2018: £238 million) of NRF was held in this way.

Post Office also has an arrangement in Scotland with a commercial banking partner whereby
surplus Scottish notes are sold to the partner overnight for repurchase the next day. At the end
of the year a total of £3 million (2018: £17 million) was outstanding under this arrangement.

23. Alternative performance measures

An alternative performance measure is a financial measure of historical or future financial

performance, position or cash flows of the Group which is not a measure defined or specified in
IFRS.

Trading profit

Trading profit is one of the Group’s key financial measures as it shows the underlying performance of
the Group. It is calculated by taking operating profit from continuing operations before depreciation,
amortisation, exceptional items, investments and Network Subsidy Payment. The table below
summarises the calculation of operating profit before exceptional items, trading profit before
Network Subsidy Payment and trading profit.

In accordance with the Funding Agreement with Government signed on 30 March 2017, Post
Office Limited received a Network Subsidy Payment of £18 million on 2 April 2019. The Network
Subsidy Payment is received on a quarterly basis and a total of £50 million will be received from
Government in 2019/20.

25. Ultimate controlling party

The Post Office Limited was a wholly owned subsidiary of Postal Services Holding Company
Limited until it entered voluntary liquidation in June 2017 and the shares in Post Office Limited
were transferred to the Secretary of State for BEIS.

The Secretary of State for BEIS holds a special share in Post Office Limited and the rights
attached to that special share are enshrined within Post Office Limited Articles of

Association. BEIS, through UK Government Investments Limited (“UKGI”), has no day to day
involvement in the operations of Post Office Limited or in the management of its branch network
and staff. As such, at 31 March 2019, the Directors regarded Post Office Limited as the
immediate and ultimate parent Company.

The largest Group to consolidate the results of the Company is Post Office Limited, a company

registered in the United Kingdom. Post Office Limited financial statements can be obtained from
Finsbury Dials, 20 Finsbury Street, EC2Y 9AQ.

Included within the above table are assets under construction of £9 million (2018: £11 million).

Depreciation rates are disclosed on page 52 within the Group accounting policies note. No
depreciation is provided on freehold land, which represents £2 million (2018: £2 million) of the total
cost of properties.

During the current and prior year, a review of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
took place and resulted in reclassifications between categories to give a more appropriate
representation of the nature of the assets.

An impairment test was performed during the year. Intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment were tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each Cash Generating
Unit (CGU) with the recoverable amount determined from the value in use calculations.

The discounted net cash flows from the value in use calculations were used to determine the
recoverable amount of the CGU’s identified, being Post Office Limited. Value in use is determined

Post Office Limited corporate. postoffice.co.uk I PAGE 92
POL00026927
POL00026927

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

using the Group’s net cash inflows from the continued use of the assets within each CGU over a
two year period (and then continued into perpetuity), with no nominal growth rate assumed
outside of this period. Pre-tax discount rates for Post Office Limited of 9.5% (2018: 9%) have
been used to discount the forecasted cash flows.

A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the value in use of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets. This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered
to be possible by management. This included an increase in the discount rate of up to 12%, zero
growth rate and a decrease in forecasted EBITDA by 5%. The sensitivity analysis showed that no
impairment would arise under each or a combined scenario.

Management therefore believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions
would not cause the carrying amount of any CGU’s to exceed their carrying value.

5. Investment in subsidiaries

The carrying value of £74 million relates £55 million to the Company's investment in Post Office
Management Services Limited, a 100% subsidiary of the Company with 55,000,000 shares at a
nominal value of £1 and 1 share with a nominal value of £100; and £19 million, in Payzone Bill
Payments Limited, a 100% subsidiary of the Company with 1 share at a nominal value of £1. The
registered address of both Post Office Management Services Limited and Payzone Bill Payments
Limited is Finsbury Dials, 20 Finsbury Street, EC2Y 9AQ.

Strategy I H

The loan under the facility is short dated on a programme of liquidity management and matures 1
day after the year-end (2018: 1 day). The fair value of borrowings approximate their carrying value
due to the short term maturities of the loan. On maturity it is expected that further loans will be
drawn down under this facility, which expires in 2021. The undrawn committed facility, in respect of
which all conditions precedent had been met at the balance sheet date, is £385 million (2018: £327
million). The average interest rate on the drawn down loans is 1.1% (2018: 0.8%).

The facility is currently restricted to funding the cash and near cash items held within the Post Office
Limited network.

The facility (including drawn down loans) is secured by a floating charge over all assets of Post Office
Limited and a negative pledge over cash and near cash items. The negative pledge is an agreement
not to grant security over the assets or to set up a vehicle that has the same effect.
