Statement of Graham BRANDER

Age if under 18 Over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18’)

This statement (consisting of one page each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and belief
and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully
stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe true.

Dated the 25 day of June 2007

Further to my previous statements, I now wish to add the following.

Following my tape-recorded interview with Josephine Hamilton on 05 May 2006, I then asked
her a number of questions for the purpose of completing NPAO1 and CS033 forms. The
specific questions asked were not recorded, as it was merely a case of completing each relevant
section from the two forms, and manually entering the information given by Mrs Hamilton. Mr
Colin Price, Investigator and Ms Kate Taylor, Solicitor were also present.

Form NPAOQ1 is used to compile personal details such as height, eye colour, shoe size etc. If a
person is subsequently served with a summons, to appear in court, to answer criminal charges,
then the Investigator dealing with the case is required to submit an electronic copy of the NPA
forms to the Investigation Casework Team within twenty-four hours of the summons being
served. It is my understanding that this information is then forwarded to the relevant Police
Authority and if the defendant is subsequently found to be guilty of the offences, then the
details are entered on the Police National Computer.

Form CS033 is used to record Antecedent information, such as domestic and financial
circumstances. Typed copies of this form are supplied to the relevant court, in cases whereby a
person is prosecuted and subsequently sentenced.

I made a notebook entry detailing my interview with Mrs Hamilton and the fact that I had

asked her some questions in order to complete the NPA and Antecedent forms.
