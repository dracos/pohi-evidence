Dear Mandy,
Thanks for your email of 6 February.

We have persuaded Castleton's solicitors to set aside the default judgment on the
Counterclaim and to accept Defendant's costs in the case of the Application up to 18
November 2005 and thereafter for costs to be in the case. They have signed and
returned a consent order (copy attached) which I am faxing to Court. I have asked
the Court to vacate the hearing on 9 February and to list a case management
conference for the first available date after 28 days. I am awaiting their
confirmation that they will vacate the hearing and will keep you updated.

It would be useful for us to have a telephone conference within say the next week
or so to discuss strategy going forward so and I will revert to you separately on
this.

Kind regards,
Stephen Dilley

Solicitor
for and on behalf of Bond Pearce LLP
