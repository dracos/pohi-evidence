Further to my statement dated 4 April 2012.

All Post Office Branches use a fully automated computerised accounting system known as
Horizon and each counter position has a computer terminal, a visual display unit, keyboard,
barcode scanner, printer and a pin pad.

Each Post Office is recognised by a unique code under which all their individual transactions
are recorded. The code for Birkenshaw Post Office is 163 306. This system records all
transactions input by a counter clerk working at a counter position against their individual
office code. All clerks are required to log onto this system using their own User ID and
unique password. This User ID can then identify which clerk conducted a particular
transaction. The User ID is normally the first letter of their Christian name and the first two
letters of their surname followed by 001. For example John Smith will be User ID JSMOO1.
The system records all transactions carried out by the staff at a Post Office branch. For

example: when a clerk selis a book of stamps the stock is reduced by one book of stamps

and the cash is increased by the value of the stamps. The system records all transactional
data inputted by a counter clerk during an accounting period and provides daily and weekly
records enabling sub postmasters and counter clerks to produce a balance of cash and stock
on hand.

A balance is a reconciliation of cash and stock levels on hand in a stock unit or in a branch at
the end of a Trading Period (TP) with receipt and payment transaction totals for the same
period. The TP is the amount of time between balances for the stock unit or branch, The
period of time which a branch account covers is normally the start of business on a
Thursday morning to close of business the following Wednesday evening, this is known as a
Balance Period (BP) and a TP will cover a number of BP's (normally four or five in total)
There are twelve Branch Trading Periods in a year, running form April through to March and
are identified by a number, for example BP1. Each Branch Trading Period follows a cycle of
5 weeks, 4 weeks and 4 weeks.

All Post Office branches are required to balance and complete a Branch Trading Staternent
at the end of each Branch Trading Period. The Branch Trading Statement is a signed
declaration of the cash and stock held at the branch at the end of the Trading Period. The
Branch Trading Statement is also a summary of the volume and value of the receipt and
payment transactions, which have been carried out in the branch during the period ob behalf

of Post Office Ltd and its clients. It is a legal document that must be signed, kept in the
branch and produced on request for audit purposes.
All Post Office branches on a weekly basis will generally transfer the cash and stock from
one Balancing Period to the next Balancing Period. However this is not compulsory and the
cash and stock may be transferred at the end of Branch Trading Period (after the four or
five week cycle) into the next Branching Trading Period.
Before you can produce a stock unit balance, there are certain activities that must be
completed. The Horizon system will identify which activities are outstanding and will prevent
you frorn completing the stock unit balance until they are completed. There are some
differences between the activities that are necessary for an individual stock balance and
those involving a shared stock unit balance.
A description of a balance is as follows:
During each BP - the branch will:
> Produce counter daily summaries and reconcile the associated documents with the
summary.
> Produce counter weekly summaries and reconcile the associated documents with the
surnmary.
> Check the suspense account (Uncharged Receipts / Unclaimed payments) to ensure
that the correct values are carried forward.
> Enter any non-accounting data (transaction information that would not otherwise
appear)
» All stock units will then be rolled over into the next balancing period.
> At the end of the four or five week balancing period a trading statement is produced.
>

The trading statement shows the current position and the account activity in the Post
