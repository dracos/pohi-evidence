Dear Mr Baugh

Thank you for your e-mail and I would comment as follows.

I would suggest that she reads,the report issued by Second Sight and does not just accept what she has been told by Post Office.
Post office have lied to the BIS Select committee,MP's and all of us involved in this debacle.the management of Post Office are
incapable of running a tea shop let alone a multi million public company, they prefer to,hide behind lawyers and spend millions of
£'s of public money trying to defend their position.

As public servants the least the minister can do is to listen to both sides and not have her opinions made up by socialising with the
CEO of Post Office.

Yours,sincerely

Mr.J. Wilson.

> Thank you for your 22 June email to Baroness Neville-Rolfe regarding the Post Office mediation scheme established in connection
with its Horizon system. The Minister receives a large amount of correspondence every day and is unable to respond to each one
personally. I have been asked to reply.

>

> As the Minister has set out in a recent letter of 25 June to your member of Parliament, the mediation scheme, established following
a small number of complaints about the Post Office's Horizon system, is independent of Government. Individual cases in the scheme
are confidential and the Government cannot comment on the details of individual cases.

>

> If you have further queries on the mediation scheme, or if you wish to raise a concern, you can contact the Post Office at any time,
whether or not you are a member of the mediation scheme.

>

> Post Office is also happy to discuss individual cases with Members of Parliament in confidence, provided the individual gives
consent to this. You can write to your MP and ask them to seek a meeting with the Post Office, if you would find this helpful.

that have much more information on this scandal and not just accepted what you have been told by Post Office. A good place to start
would be James Arbuthnot and then 2nd Sight.
