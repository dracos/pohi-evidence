Comments RTU EVALUATIONS

Couldn't have been better, and was put in plain English

Excellent presentation - came over very professionally. Learned a lot as not having
been to an RTU

Enjoyed the Session very much

Excellent in all respects

'V useful & informative, needs to be rolled out asap to all B.Sec's
Very interesting and useful day

Excellent presentation.

Many thanks.

Excellent Meeting

Many thanks for a very useful day

Excellent

1 look forward to more events of this kind and have others on my committee wishing to
attend. Well done Kate.

There should be regular refresher courses as well to ensure we remember what has been
learnt and to be up to date with new rule changes

Very instructive and within one particular group there were some experienced Branch
‘Secretaries who gave us the benefit of their wide experience within our Federation.
Include: Procedures for dealing with losses where Hoizon software is claimed to be at
fault

Leamed more about the organisation as a whole (NFSP)

Very interesting first foray into this field
Federation to ensure all members are aware of procedures to follow in the case of H
discipline cases I
{ Suggest use of videos showing scenarios where action taken right or wrong - tape
pauses so that group/individuals can discuss

Membership and how to run a branch would have been a better first session

Would have liked on first training to have leart more of what my role as secretary really
entails

Very impressed. It was much better than anticipated and I feel more confident to speak
ito members re any problems and outcomes of same.

Practice is the next step and I agree wholeheartedly about sitting in with the next
disciplinary case in my area

Very worthwhile course. I feel much more confident and better equipped to represent my
members.

Training was a fruitful experience and hope to carry forward all the facts.

POID - roles, etc. Facts on number of RTU's etc per annum to all evaluation of use/type
etc.

Having examples to work out proved very helpful. We had as much information as we
could absorb. Excellent.

The day was well worth it. Instructor had very good knowledge of subject and put it
across well in a way I understood. Throughout the whole presentation made sure we
understood what was being said.

Everything was covered in the course

NFSP00000822
NFSP00000822

Handouts and a guide to help spm effectively handle an RTU or notes that could be
looked at later time

Obviously as Br Sec we would require tohave copies of various spm’s contracts, ie,
IMSPO, Mailwork, etc. How can these be obtained?

INeed more handouts. Flip chart instead of learning tearing sheets of paper

Copies of contracts could be made available. Woprtwhile learning expereince. No
handouts available

More handouts

[Spread over 2 days at it was much too heavy to take in 1 day. The role play exercise
was in my view one of the best leaming exercises.

Excellent. A flow chart to asst Fed members would be good as a check list

Very full and intensive day. Showed the detail you need to know to support members in
trouble.
Very informative and well presented training session

I feel that the RTU handout could be fuller

I found this training session very good as I have had nothing to do with appeal interviews
in the past.

Perhaps an earlier start may be useful.

Role Play is useful but must be specific if benefit is to be gained. Give individual briefs
to each role player and let them act it out.

This training session was useful to me as I have never been asked to attend a RTU
meeting. Now I feel ! have a better knowledge of what is required at a RTU.

Case studies shouldl have been circulated in advance to allow case preparation. I
1) May be future subjects should start in the order of things a Branch Secretary has to H
do, from day one of his/her post. 2) Keep new BS separate from experienced ones.

POID interview could have been given more time. Excellent presentation - long

Still not fully sure re agreed timetables, nor fully convinced that POL make full efforts to
meet these. Obviously once we are fully conversant with the timescales we need to
push POL to ensure they adhere to these.

Correct rules and regulations relating to procedures and timing for RTUs and the
information that could help us point out that faults in the PON procedures.

Find the prospect of representing members rather daunting. Members require
representation by experienced branch secs.

In depth knowledge is required and should only be undertaken if have sufficient time to
do the role correctly.

Excellent informative day - well structured and long overdue. An efficient way of
providing adequate instruction of the issues required by Br Sec/delegate.

IA really good base of knowledge to start from.

‘Well presented, much needed course thank you!!

NFSP00000822
NFSP00000822

Very well presented, always wanted to be on one of these. Excellent course, should
have been done much earlier years ago. Better late than never. Well done Kate. Thank
you.

Very good. I came to this course with no experience and now feel confident in
representing a member.

Future gathering of branch Secs where past scenarios can be used for discussions and
possible model answers.

When secuirty is breeched what are the allowable guidelines? The most beneficial parts
of the day was the exchange of experiences.

Losses & Gains? Essential new Branch Secs receive the training.

Comments MEMBERSHIP EVALUATIONS

An excellent presentation given in a professional manner. All points covered were of
great importance to carrying out an effective job in recruiting new members.

Flowcard/progress form for new appointees could be helpful.

Very good day, very worthwhile.

Would like to be able to have the technical machinery, ie, projector & laptop to be able to i
hold our own branch meetings in a more professional manner. I

Enjoyed the course and found it stimulating, was good to see others getting involved. i

IA very pleasant and worthwhile experience. Full participation by everyone present. Our
Branch must gain in members from the ideas and incentives we have been given by

IA very good and useful presentation.

Well presented and enjoyable, useful information "Best Practice" passed on. More
training sessions - improve officer qualities. Thank you.

Very useful, I enjoyed the course, I was able to contribute my fears, problems, etc,
openly and was given constructive feedback and solutions. This learning opportunity
helps to build inner confidence to deal with matters relating to the NFSP.

I found the day very useful with a good cross participation of the members and presenter
