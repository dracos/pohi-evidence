Subject: Letter to Second Sight re quality of work

Chris

Linklaters have drafted a letter for Second Sight to enable us to begin to take clear steps to control their costs and tackle
poor quality and performance. It is attached.

Chris Day and Paula were (understandably keen to get something on the record about costs. Chris was even minded to
write himself.

I think that we should separate out the Part Two Report from the matter of Second Sight's engagement - however I do
think it gives us the catalyst for making a number of the comments we are making re vfm asl think the fundamental point
is that they've been investigating since May 2012 and said at the MP's meeting in March and the Working Group in

the same month that Part Two would be ready in March yet it arrives in August and is of a very poor quality and does not
appear to be the the product of over two year's investigation.

Despite committing to sending me a proposal for different funding arrangements they have not done so, and said they do
not have a slot available to discuss with me until next week. I have not gone back on this until we agree how to proceed.

Before I do any more work on this I'd be grateful for your views on how you wish to proceed. Importantly, if we say we
are going to take some action we should do so.

I think we should get something to them this week.

Best wishes

Subje Examples for letter to SS [BD-4A.FID20472253]

Belinda
I attach a revised draft of the letter to Second Sight.
Key changes to note are:

- I have changed the title to their “engagement” rather than referring to the Report, because the former is really what the
letter is about.

- I have inserted an initial paragraph referring to the final report and fact PO will now need to take steps to deal with it.

- I have re-focussed the first main paragraph to, hopefully, be more “punchy” with regard to the key message of this letter-
SS are failing in their role as an independent fact finder and service provider to the Working Group.

- I have inserted most of the examples you and Andrew sent through into places I hope others agree are appropriate.

- I have reworked the 3" point into something more about SS's failure to perform its proper role and the lack of utility and
helpfulness of what they are doing, than about their impartiality/bias.

- I have developed a bit the section on the proposed changes to their billing arrangements.
Do let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss or need any further drafting work from me on the letter.
Kind regards

Jonathan
