PURPOSE

This paper explores various contingency options which could be considered
to allow Horizon New Release 2 to go ahead in the absence of a proven
capability of the ICL Pathway solution to feed the POCL iTIP system.

Nothing contained within this paper shall be deemed or construed as
affecting existing contractual obligations between ICL Pathway, the DSS
and/or POCL.

Given the sensitive nature of the paper, it has not been subject to widespread
consultation, and in particular this work has not involved ICL Pathway. The
assistance of Peter Jones and Martin Box of the TIP project is, however,
gratefully acknowledged.

BACKGROUND

Overview

The EPOS service being, developed by ICL Pathway as part of the Horizon
programme includes in its design a feed of data to the POCL back end
systems via the TIP interface. This interface consists of various file types that
contain transactions, client summaries, BES summary transactions, stock
information and an electronic version of the Cash Account. EPOSS is
intended to be, in part, data driven, through data provided to ICL Pathway
from the POCL Reference Data Project (RDP) which ties into the TIP system
that is also fed by RDP.

During the Model Office and End to End test phases with the ICL Pathway
Horizon solution, significant problems have been experienced in using, the
data stream provided by ICL Pathway. It is believed that ICL Pathway may
not be able to fix these problems within the necessary timescales to enable
the full data feed to TIP to be proven without causing a severe impact on the
New Release 2 timescales.

Given the political and commercial imperatives around these timescales, it
has therefore been deemed prudent to consider possible contingency
arrangements involving alternative feeds to the POCL back end systems
should these problems not be resolved for New Release 2.

Errors being experienced
The problems that have been experienced include:

. inability to make files available to TIP;

. no balanced cash accounts in first phases of testing;

+ files containing wrongly dated transactions;

. files containing incorrect versions of reference data;

. files containing ‘spurious’ outlets, not known to RDP or TIP;

+ files containing transactions that cannot be performed according to the
submitted reference data and business rules - causing TIP to
abnormally end (abend) processing;

+ files resubmission taking several days and then being rejected as the
“hand crafted’ fixes invalidate the file integrity - totals etc..

As can be seen, the problems being experienced appear to be occurring
across the board and are not confined to one or two specific areas. This
means that that there is not just one area that is deficient and in need of
attention but several.

The problems are believe to be wholly within the ICL Pathway domain, in
that the output files from Pathway are non-compliant with the agreed
Application Interface Specification. To date, during the Model Office
Rehearsal and End to End phases, there have been no significant faults raised
on TIP asa result of the testing with ICL Pathway.

There is no evidence to suggest that the ‘content’ errors are confined to the
feed to TIP. Indeed the nature of the problems would suggest that the paper
reports and processing within the outlet would be suffering many of the
same faults as the resultant feed to TIP. The computerised nature of TIP
makes such faults easier to find and more rigorous than any manual
checking that may be being performed.

It is also possible that transactions can be performed outside of POCL’s
expectations by non-enforcement of the reference data rules. The resultant
transaction will not have a place on in-outlet reports - including the cash
account - and may therefore ‘disappear’, only appearing on the TIP
transaction stream.

Mitigation

Work is ongoing to address the faults in the system. Several faults are
attributable to the testing environment itself and would not be anticipated in
true running. However, MOR/MOT and E2E are not user acceptance
testing, and the Horizon Service should have been functionally tested before
entry to this phase and thus several of the faults should not have occurred.

Interim vs. Operational TIP

Interim TIP (iTIP) was conceived as a short term stop gap to prove the
interface between POCL and ICL Pathway. As an interim system, originally
developed to meet a much earlier go-live date, it has limited functionality,
however, it was designed to accept the interface that the long term
Operational TIP (OpTIP) would require.

OpTIP has a wider remit than just the ICL Pathway feed, as it will
additionally subsume several POCL legacy systems, and utilise the data that

is received from ICL Pathway (rather than just passing it on).

iTIP can therefore be considered as a stop gap solution that pre-proves the
ICL Pathway feed, and provides some limited business gains.

Summary of data sent to TIP

There are four main file types specified to pass from ICL Pathway to TIP, as
summarised in the following table:

BES Summary BES Settlement Reports BES Settlement reports to PMSR.
Transaction files | Individual record for each PoS | ¢ BES supporting,
transaction. These include documentation (ABED
elements of the services such as equivalent)
BES to allow POCL to maintain
its accounting integrity. # Royal Mail Management
Information (RMMI) for
former ECCO offices
Client Summary | Client summaries Not used by iTIP

3. ASSUMPTIONS

For the avoidance of doubt, the following assumptions have been made
about the ICL Pathway/TIP working environment:

* EPOSS encompasses the POCL PoS functions which support APS, BES
and OBCS as well as the ‘pure’ POCL stock movements;

¢ the interface that Interim TIP has defined will be taken over by
Operational TIP!; for the purpose of this document there is no difference
between the two systems as far as the ICL Pathway system feed is
concerned;

* the TIP interface has been agreed for many months, with only minor
clarification and additions of new functions e.g. 2/3 week cash accounts.

¢ The existing counter functions will not be any less at NR2 than they are at
Te.

¢ TIP has several business functions, the main ones being:
1) electronic transmission of the cash account.

TIP presents the Horizon electronic cash account to CBDB as if it had
come from the DPU, effectively spoofing the DPU interface to CBDB;

+ CBDB can receive Cash Account data for an office from either the DPU
or TIP. CBDB will accept the first instance for a particular cash account
week, and raise an exception if a second copy is received;

during the Release 1c > New Release 2 migration period, the DPU will
key ICL Pathway produced paper Cash Accounts? (prior to the
availability of the electronic NR2 feed from ICL Pathway);

once an office has successfully migrated to Horizon, the paper Cash
Account from that office will not be routinely keyed, and therefore no
comparison will be done against the electronic feed. The paper copy
will, however, be received and filed

1 There are opportunities to increase the efficiency of OpTIP by changes to the interface and
potentially to ease the workload on ICL Pathway by changes, however the underlying data
requirement that has been stated for iTIP will be sufficient to feed OpTIP which is scheduled for
October 1999.

2 This is subject to the acceptability of the presentation of the ICL Pathway cash account, currently
there are issues surrounding the size of type face which DPU require to move from 8 point to 12
point.

8 It is unclear whether any checks are in place to handle “manual amendments” if the sub-postmaster
annolates the document with corrections prior to signature.

2) TIP produces the supporting BES documentation from the EPOSS
transaction elements - i.e. effectively takes over the function performed
by ABED in Release 1c.

3) TIP provides the rolling BES settlement reports which feed into PMSR
for information on reconciliation;

4) TIP supports the Royal Mail Management Information (RMMI) feed
that is currently taken from ECCO+ outlets;

5) TIP receives all the transactions performed on the Horizon system and
validates them against the reference data that it has received from the
POCL RDP system - the same system that feeds ICL Pathway Horizon.

4, OPTIONS CONSIDERED

The following table summaries potential options based on the availability of
various proven aspects of the ICL Pathway solution.

Notk: For the purposes of this discussion, EPOSS has been (slightly
artificially) divided into “data capture/reporting” and “cash account
production”.

Taking each of the major business functions identified in turn, i.e.

1) Cash account

2) Supporting BES documentation
3) BES settlement reports

4) RMMI

5) Transaction warehousing

Given the scope of the paper the cash account issue will receive most
attention.

In this option the feed to TIP is considered unworkable but the remainder of
the solution is deemed to be fit for use. The EPOSS solution would have to
be capable of producing a valid paper cash account and of correctly
accounting for business within the office, enforcing all the relevant business
rules.

Assumes:

¢ EPOSS operates in all areas apart from interface to TIP.

DN: Given that the electronic and paper cash accounts are both produced from the
same data source in EPOSS - a necessity if one is to accurately reflect the other - it
seems unlikely this option will actually occur; for this to be of use, the “problem”
would need to be within the data transfer to TIP, rather than its processing at the
counter. Evidence to date suggests that the problems are within the counter in the
correct adherence to business rules - what a product can be used for - and the
processing of the Cash Account mapping. Such problems are believed to apply
equally to both electronic and paper Cash Accounts in the ICL Pathway domain.

In this option, neither the paper nor the electronic Cash Accounts from
EPOSS are deemed to be fit for purpose. However, EPOSS would continue
to be used for transaction capture, summary production and stock control.
Some method would be necessary to handle the rollover of Cash Account
Periods (to enable the correct reporting of transactions);

Assumes:
¢ that the deficiencies in EPOSS are restricted to the Cash Account
production process and are not “structural”;

¢ that the carrying forward of data from week to week, the feed of data to
APS and for BES etc. is sound;

¢ the correct implementation of business rules, including those within
reference data, is proven;

¢ current output has all the data for a manual cash account.

New rollover processing,

In this option, EPOSS would not be used for non-automated transactions,
and the Cash Account would be produced manually from standard paper

Customer sessions would cease to have real meaning and the majority of
reports would therefore be meaningless, however reports could be run for
APS and BES to contribute to the manual cash account,

2. [ No TIP feed v * Assumes paper reports correct.

3. | No EPOSS but BES * v 1e counter functions, but NR2

4.2.1. Option 1 - full solution

This is the target NR2 contracted-for status, with full implementation of the
TIP interface. It should be noted that the gathering of transactions to
generate the BES documentation is largely an office function (the exception
being help desk generated transactions), augmented by central processing

within the ICL Pathway domain.

4.2.2. Option 2 - no electronic feed

This is where the central system can not extract the transactions for supply to
TIP for processing, or the file transfer from the central system to TIP is

inoperative.

Assumes:

© EPOSS and BES work harmoniously in all areas except for delivery of flow

to TIP;

¢ Paper reports and existing manual processes sustainable;

© Central facilities can still feed ABED as at 1c;

¢ Common Basis of Settlement operates correctly.

BES settlement reports

43.1. Option 1 - full solution

This is the target NR2 contracted-for status, with full implementation of the
TIP interface. It should be noted that the rolling reports are a function of
Common Basis of Settlement which is based on transactions from the outlets
and help desk generated transactions.

43.2, Option 2 - no electronic feed

This option applies where the central system can not package the CBoS
reports or transmit them to TIP. Note that this feed is different from the
other data passed to TIP in that it is created centrally, by CBoS functionality
in PAS, rather than originating from the office. __ It is therefore not related,
per se, with EPOSS failure, however as it relates to failure of the feed to TIP it
is still considered relevant to this discussion.

45, Transaction Warehousing
45.1. Option 1 - full solution

This is the target NR2 contracted-for status, with full implementation of the
TIP interface. It should be noted that the generation of transactions to
generate the RMMI flow is an office function.

In addition to the warehousing for later data mining, the validation within
TIP checks that products have been used in valid modes (e.g. Postal Order
fees have not been remitted) and that the correct version of POCL Reference
Data is in use at outlets.

4.5.2. Option 2-no feed

In this option the feed to TIP of the transactions gernerated at the outlet can
not be transferred to TIP.

Assumes:

¢ The outlet is functioning correctly and that the problem is restricted to the
harvesting (extraction) of the transactions from the correspondence
servers and / or beyond.

Removes the issue. Reduced function to POCL.

5.1.

IMPACT OF OPTION SELECTION

There are various scenarios that colour the major business functions that TIP
offers. These range from the full NR2 solution through to no electronic feed
to TIP to inability to produce suitable automated output in the outlet with
various shades in between.

Based on the premise that the Horizon system must be viable to a degree,
certain options can be discounted as without them the live trialt would be
invalidated. Based on the further premise that certain functions can, as a
concession, be lived without for a time, a middle ground of viable,
compromised functions can be reached.

5.2,

5.3.

The table above summarises an opinion of where such lines may be drawn
and then investigates the issues surrounding the remaining options.

Note: these options are TIP centric. However, there is no evidence to support
the view that where there are deficiencies in the data ICL Pathway are
supplying to TIP the outlet equivalent is without fault.

Risks

¢ if we go live with a “part” functioning EPOSS solution, what confidence
exists with the other part? Can POCL rely on a such a system for its
accounting? Indeed, would faults be created by, or attributed to, the cut
down nature.

what is the validity of the “Live Trial” if the significant functionality - e.g.
Cash Account production - cannot be proven. Could “Live Trial”
sensibly commence until full EPOSS was in place with all its’ outputs
working? Would a ‘Id’ phase that deployed the NR2 data centre
architecture and better, but not NR2 complete data centre and counter
functions be of merit?

¢ how do you migrate from a partial solution to the full solution - will a
migration tool be required, how much faith would you have?

* reconciliation processes may rely on the EPOSS data - how will
reconciliation be performed without such data ?

© Options 4.1.4 - and in some respects 4.1.3 - almost revert the system to not
having an EPOSS system. In this case, what is the additional
functionality provided by a Child Benefit-only NR2, apart from APS.
Functionally, the release would become “Ric with APS” rather than
“NR2”.

Benefit

¢ Provides some ability for a form of New Release 2 to be installed, albeit
in cut down form, without a dependency on full EPOSS. Allows some
visible progress to be shown, including the cutover to dual data centre
operation, introduction of Automated Payments, and potentially offers an
incremental route to the full New Release 2 service.

¢ May allow focus on changes to allow ICL Pathway to meet an interface in
time for Operational TIP

6. CONCLUSION

From the summary table in the previous section, the conclusion is that the
feed from ICL Pathway to TIP is not mandatory for value to be gained from a
limited deployment.

Providing a minimum of 1¢ counter functionality is maintained, and this is
augmented with APS and PoS all working in conjunction with EPOSS at the
counter (including EPOSS reporting but possibly not a system cash account)
there are significant gains to be made.

However, whether such gains should warrant the title ‘Live Trial’, and
whether such a system is considered suitable for Acceptance, is questionable.
Although it may be possible to install a cut down version of NR2 without full
EPOSS in a limited number of offices, the functionality offered may not make
it possible to achieve the full aims of the ‘Live Trial’ and may therefore force
the need for further downstream trialling activities before a National Rollout
could be commenced.
