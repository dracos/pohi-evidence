Appeals Managers

Hi and Happy New Year to you all!

Iam completing the planning for the Appeals Panel Refresher Training on Thursday 31“ January at 11:00 am in
Room 501, Old Street. As it has been so long since we originally planned the day, I thought it best to send out a
quick reminder. I have attached the zip file with the agenda and relevant documents, which have not changed
since I originally sent them 02/11/12.

You will recall that I asked you to select an appeals case that you have completed and come prepared to present,
share and discuss it. Nothing too formal is required — just enough so the group can understand the issues and
learn from your experiences. I would be grateful if you would let me know which case it will be, so we can
ensure the main learning topics are covered in the various cases or by other means.

Kevin and Gary — you should have received the case studies. I will contact you separately.

Thanks and I look forward to seeing you on 31*

Regards

Alan Lusher I Contracts advisor
