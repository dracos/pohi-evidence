Develop a bridge from last year to this year so that we can ensure that

Info

25% of our current Revenue is in the 4™ line support that we currently
provide for legacy applications. About 10 of the 14 Apps we support
could be said to fall into this area.

Info

Steve Boyle is focused right now on mitigating the risk of Mike Young
presenting a different view of Legacy Apps than ours to his
management.

Develop financial scenarios (TCV/Rew/Profit/commercial risk) that
could play out moving forward so that executive decisions over
ongoing investment can be made. This must be done as a priority so
that actions that may be necessary to avoid misalignment between FJ
and POL can be considered BEFORE Mike Young presents at the POL
Executive Board on 19th Jul 11. Present to DT on 14" July.

Info

A new CTO (AA) and Sales Director (CM) have now joined the Account
Team.

Info

Project Updates: Approximately 50% of the HNG-X counters have now
been rolled out. The POLSAP and AEI projects are being delivered to
time and budget and we have received positive feedback from POL.

Info

Current press coverage regarding claims being brought to POL from
Sub Postmaster’s is Horizon related, not HNG-X.

Info

The team is on track to achieve its full year numbers but this is
dependent on closing 2 new business opportunities and settling POLs
compensation claim within the budgeted allowance.

Info

The “journey financials” (Slide 7) include the previous Account
Director's aspirations that did not materialise. These figures will be re-
worked based on the current strategy.

Info

A BAR for the Branch Engineering Consolidation opportun ity is
expected in the next 4-6 weeks. The cost model and due diligence will
likely be completed in the next 3-4 weeks.

Info

POL has proposed a claim of £5.8m (down from £8m), which we
believe is unreasonably high. Negotiation of this is dependent on th e
BEC due diligence and costing being completed. Also, POL has not
produced evidence of reasonable mitigation and has asked us for help
on another of their programmes that is over-running.

Info

The team are working on consolidating the servers in the NI data
centre, which is likely to take another 6-8 months to complete.

Info

It is likely that POL may want something non -proprietary in terms of
IPR for their longer term technology solution, which contrasts with their
existing solution that is very tailored and complex. This complexity is
driven by the demands of POL’s customers (i.e. DVLA, DWP), which is
reducing as people are doing more online (i.e. TV Licensing).

Info

The team has been speaking with POL about their technology strategy
and are working on a “shadow proposition” that would involve exclusive
fe-negotiations with them ahead of this contract expiring in 2015.

Info

PA Consulting is advising POL regarding the 20 -25% headcount
reduction they want to achieve. We are looking into helping via
potentially taking on the heads on selling them back to POL.

Update on actions from review held on 31/1/07 —

Project Sphere — has ‘gone away’ for now. From a customer
perspective, there was no real sponsorship outside of finance. There
is another session due in February between Steven Pownall, Liam
Foley and FD within PO. Keep it on the radar as a potential
opportunity.

Completed. Sphere has been closed down - risk of tax avoidance

all recoverable.
