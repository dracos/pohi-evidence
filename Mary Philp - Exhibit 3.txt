Dear Mary

Thank you for your email about the Historical Shortfall Scheme. We are sorry it has
taken some time to provide a response but would like to assure you that your enquiry
has been considered carefully.

The Scheme was open for 3 months and closed on 14 August 2020. In addition we
allowed 15 more weeks for Postmasters with exceptional circumstances to apply.
However, this ‘grace period’ passed quite some time ago and in order to ensure that we
are able to progress those applications within the scheme in a fair and timely manner,
we are unable to accept any further applications into the Scheme.

We do recognise that this will likely be disappointing news for you but hope that you

understand the reason for our decision and wish you all the best.

Kind regards

Post Office Historical
