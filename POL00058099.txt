I can't see the attachment for context but the Post Office Press Office hasn't yet been approached on that matter so we

haven't written a statement of that kind. I did, as a courtesy, write wording for Ron Warmington recently to assist him in
responding to a subpostmaster approach he had received on this matter which was:

The scope of our Investigation has yet to be finalised and indeed our appointment has not yet been approved by James
Arbuthnot. What I can say is that it has become very clear to us that the Post Office's senior management wants the
investigation to get to the truth and, if appointed, we wouldn’t put our names to anything less than full impartiality and
transparency.

Hope this helps
Regards

Ronan

Ronan do we have a form of word around the independence on 2"¢ Sight, and what they are being asked to do, as it feels
as if we need to use consistent language.

Angela on the third point do you know of any evidence where customers have complained because of the system, for
example, taking money twice.

Michelle do we have any cases like this to you knowledge

Thanks

DEADLINE FOR DRAFT: 23/07/2012

(CUSTOMER DETAILS: Karen Lumley MP
SUBJECT: Horizon challenge on behalf of Julian Wilson

FOR THE SIGNATURE OF: TBC

Alwen - Angela

First let me introduce myself, I am Donna Gilhooly and I recently joined Michelles team as stakeholder
correspondence team leader, I hope that I will be up and running shortly and really apreciate your assistance at
this early stage.

Please find below a letter which has been sent to Moya Greene. by the MP Karen Lumley, on behalf of her
constituent Julian Wilson ex-subpostmaster at Astwood Bank/Post office.

Not quite sure if this should come to you, but I understand that you have been involved in the recent
developments/meetings with MPs. I would be grateful for your input on how to respond, so that I can prepare a
draft response. I have a response to the recent BBC article but this is questioning the approach we are taking,
raising a further issue.

In respect of the signatory I am happy for this to go out in my name, but given the sensitivity and high profile is
there a view on whether this type of MP enquiry should be responded to by one of yourselves; please advise on

your view on this.

Thank you
