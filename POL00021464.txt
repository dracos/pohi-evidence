Policies: Investigations Policy

21 Jonathan Hill introduced the paper, which had been circulated
previously and was taken as read. The following points were discussed:

- The existing policy had not been used for some time and as such,
the policy has been completely overhauled, following an industry
approach.

- The policy sets out minimum standards for how Post Office will
conduct investigations wherever they might take place in the
business to ensure a consistent approach, building on comments
in Fraser J‘s judgment.

- The Chair noted that an issue that was made clear from the
Group Litigation Order (GLO) was the attitude of the investigator.
Whilst issues like the duty of good faith would only apply in the
Post  Office/Postmaster _ relationship (not commercial
relationships), it was agreed that the attitude of the investigator
should be addressed in the policy.

- It was also noted that matters such as the independence of the
investigator and the level of expertise needed should also be
clear in the policy. It was explained that the policy was simply a
framework and other policies were still relevant such as Conflicts
of Interest. Nonetheless, it was agreed that these matters should
be made clear in the policy, including references to other policies
as appropriate.

- Ken McCall questioned whether the policy considers service level
agreements (SLAs) with Postmasters and Board/Committee
review of the relevant metrics in this regard. Ben Foat explained
that such matters were for specific Postmaster polices and this
policy was very much a minimum standards framework.

- Ken McCall was also concerned about the accessibility of the
policy, particularly for Postmasters, and how the policy would be
rolled out. It was explained that this was an internal policy, rather
than Postmaster facing. Nonetheless Compliance was developing
a one to two page summary to make the policy more accessible
as well as engaging with relevant Policy Owners to ensure they
understand the requirements and can evidence compliance.

- Tom Cooper requested that the policy also be externally
reviewed.

Accordingly, the Committee APPROVED the Investigations Policy,
subject to:

i. The inclusion of details on the appropriate attitude of the
investigator; the need for the investigator to be independent
and have the appropriate expertise and appropriate
references to other relevant policies; and

41 Risk Update

Mark Baldock introduced the paper, which had been circulated
previously and was taken as read. The key points were summarised as

o Operational: Postmaster risks were already articulated,
but further work was to be carried out, as well as
considering whether other risks had an impact on
Postmasters. The Chair noted a discussion in the Internal
Audit meeting that morning about how to implement
controls around Postmaster risks and how to validate GLO
initiatives. Mark Baldock was asked to pick this up with I ACTION:
Jonathan Hill with an update to be provided at the March I MB
meeting. Multiple partner fragility was also noted as a key
operational risk due to the economic threats to the high
street.

4.2

Ken McCall requested that the following be reviewed:

- The wording of paragraph 13 relating to the financial risk around
“insufficient” funding reflect the risk of uncertainty about
funding;

- Paragraph 25 relating to the risk of prolonged industrial action as
this should refer to pace of response rather than the risk of
material long term industrial action; and

- Paragraph 27 relating to adverse external economic factors,
noting that much of this was outside Post Office’s control and
that, some elements had upsides for Post Office.

Mark Baldock was asked to review these sections, discuss further with
Ken McCall and provide an update for the next Committee meeting.

The Committee NOTED the current status of key risks and GRC
implementation and APPROVED the proposals on the role of the Board
and ARC with respect to oversight of Post Office risk management as
set out in paragraph 31 of the paper.

The Chair noted the extensive work that had gone into the paper and
questioned whether, given the resourcing pressures, it was better to
work on KRIs to trigger a red/amber/green rating. The Committee
agreed but noted that Legal and Compliance and Postmaster related
activity were important areas in which to have risk appetite statements.
There was also a suggestion that areas that were less under pressure
in the short term could also be considered (such as finance). As such,
Mark Baldock was asked to look at identifying the KRIs for Postmasters I ACTION:
with the Network team and consider working on statements for one or I MB

two other areas for update at the March Committee meeting (in the

Compliance Update

Jonathan Hill introduced the paper, which had been circulated
previously and was taken as read. It was summarised as follows:

- Controls Framework: Work was being undertaken with the
Historical Matters Unit (HMU) to ensure the correct controls were
embedded into the relevant areas, so as to meet obligations
arising from the Common Issue Judgment (CIJ), Horizon Issue
Judgment (HIJ) and the stamps review. There was an existing
controls framework in Finance and IT (although the latter was
being overhauled), but there was no consistent approach across
the rest of the business. This was what the Framework was to
provide, such that the business could self-assess controls with
assurance provided by Compliance. Ken McCall noted that the
report outlined that there had been changes to the Postmaster
Onboarding process and questioned whether this meant the
onboarding process was quicker. Jonathan Hill was asked to
confirm this point for update at the next meeting. This area was
ultimately owned by Dan Zinner, Group Chief Operating Officer,
but supported by Amanda Jones (Retail and Franchise Network
Director), Finance and Legal. Nick Read highlighted that
recruitment of the Postmaster Director and the Customer
Experience Director was critical but would require careful
recruitment criteria.

In response to questions from Ken McCall raising concerns about
the wording of this section in the report (paragraph 11), it was
confirmed that it was the mapping of processes for activities
addressing the CIJ that had no consistent approach, rather than
the controls themselves. Key was evidence of controls and a
consistency of approach. The HMU team was working with the
relevant business areas to address this. However, the Chair
asked Jonathan Hill to further consider before the next meeting
any underlying issues (not just related to mapping), what
controls were in place and whether or not they were appropriate.

Zarin Patel also requested that the Committee have sight of the
KMPG review of the HIJ when this was ready, noting that there
were a lot of papers regarding Postmasters before the Committee
and the Board and therefore questioned whether the issue was
under control. Al Cameron explained that much work had been
done to ensure legal compliance with the judgment, but work
was on-going and KMPG and Deloitte were likely to raise issues
that had not yet been considered. As such the controls
framework was very important and must be sustainable.

far, nothing had been found in the reviews that had not already
been disclosed. However, work was on-going.

- Cookies: Previous direction was that Post Office should look to
be in the “middle of the pack” when it comes to cookies. The
recent decision in France against Google and Amazon Europe was
noted and it was explained that typically (pre-Brexit), the
Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) aligned with Europe. As
such, the Digital and Compliance teams were looking at the
commercial impact of tightening the approach to cookies, with a
view to still remaining in the “middle of the pack.” The Chair
requested that the team carefully consider appropriate
benchmarking in a post Brexit world.

- Fire Risk Assessments: The Committee requested to be kept up
to date regarding the outstanding actions in respect of fire risk
assessments undertaken in June and July which are currently I ACTION:
being investigated by the Head of Health & Safety. This was to I JH
be included in the Compliance report for the March meeting.

The Committee NOTED the Compliance update, in particular:

- The Controls Framework update;
- The Data Management activities; and
- Post Office’s approach to cookies.

Annual Report & Accounts Update

7A Al Cameron introduced the paper, which had been circulated previously
and was taken as read. The following points were highlighted:

- Work was actively progressing to complete the Annual Report
and Accounts (ARA) for the financial year end 29 March 2020.
The ARA was largely drafted but needed some considerable
updates given the events over the last six to eight months.
Outstanding issues included:

1. A provision for Post Group Litigation Order and the
calculation of the accounting estimate in respect of the HSS,
as well as disclosure updates in respect of this scheme, the
contingent liability for Starling litigation and subsequent
events disclosure for the historical criminal cases.

2. Impairment on insurance business investment which was
likely to be around £15-20m

3. A provision for hard to place branches, which might be up to
£30m, although there was a question as to whether this was
a past event or a new decision for inclusion in accounts to the
financial year end 29 March 2020. (Tom Cooper noted that
this was a joint reputational issue for Post Office and the
Government and needed to be discussed at the Board). Note:
This was subsequently discussed at the Board meeting later
on the same day.

4. The wording regarding contingent liabilities needed to be
discussed.

5. The Committee would need to agree that the CCRC issue was
included as a subsequent event (as it was in the future as at
29 March 2020).

- Adetailed going concern assessment then needs to be completed
for a period of 18 months (rather than 12 months) from accounts
submission. Therefore, forecasts were being examined. PWC
have made it clear that unless a viability statement covers a
period of 18 months, they would likely include an emphasis of
matter paragraph in their opinion. Tom Cooper remarked that his
team were discussing this disclosure with BEIS Finance.

- The intention was for the Committee to review the accounts for
approval (for onward submission to the Board) on 26 February
2021.

- The sections relating to Risk and Remuneration would largely be
unchanged but the CEO and Chairman's report were being
completely redrafted.

The Committee NOTED:
i. the status of the Post Office Limited Group Annual Report and
Accounts for the year ended 29 March 2020
ii. the key items required for completion and signing of the ARA;
and
iii. the plan for completion and signing.

9.1 Tim Perkins introduced the paper, which had been circulated previously
and was taken as read. The following points were highlighted:

- Performance has continued to be positive. Average loss per
branch has fallen from just under £135 per trading period per
branch to £63.44 per trading period per branch. This has been

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 14

driven by proactive intervention, less cash in network, timeliness
of corrections and improved training.

- Next steps were to continue with these interventions and see
what can be done to improve the speed of corrections and
improvement in stock. Work was being done with HMU to remove
the “settled centrally” terminology from Horizon and add a
dispute button at the point of settling.

- Tom Cooper queried when the minimum value that can be settled
centrally would be changed from £150 to £0, noting he thought
this had been removed previously. Tim Perkins explained that
Accenture had just quoted to do this, and it was requested that I ACTION:
Tim Perkins provide the date as to when this would happen to I TP
the Committee once he is advised of it.

- In response to further questions about branches being able to be
‘rolled’ into the next trading period and how disputed items were
dealt with, Tim Perkins explained that balances are moved to a
Postmaster account to allow an investigation to take place to
establish the cause of the loss. A button would also be added to
Horizon to allow immediate dispute.

- Age of the transaction error was the crucial, rather than the
number of errors. At present, measurements were based on
transactions over two months old. A measurement of 45 to 60
days (depending on the type of transaction) was being
considered to take into account how long client reconciliation
takes.

- At the request of Ken McCall more detail was provided on the
process where a cash declaration had not been done for 10 days
or for trading period roll overs (where not done for 60 days).
First, the Postmaster would be called by the team (bearing in
mind any branch closure) and the issue would be escalated to
the Area Manager. Where repeated contact has to be made, the
branch will also be visited to ensure they understand the
requirement and to understand the barrier(s) to completion.
There would also be a conversation with the contract advisor
team about contract performance.

- It was confirmed that branches with high cash holdings or highest
levels of cash deposits have excellent compliance with the branch
accounting requirements. However, for branches with high levels
of cash deposits, more transaction errors were seen, and this was
an area of focus, particularly as to whether better equipment
could be provided. Additional support from Area Managers and
Security Managers was being provided with a visit every month.
The Committee commented that key was to tackle this issue at
source. Al Cameron explained that any proposed changes had
been postponed given ongoing process reviews in this area.

- The Chair noted that it was good to see the figures decreasing
but that it would be useful to see a dashboard of branch balances
and transaction corrections, possibly as an addition to the

reporting on post GLO remediation. (Tim Perkins and Amanda I ACTION:
Jones to action for the next Committee meeting). TP/AJ

- Via email outside the meeting, Zarin Patel also suggested that I ACTION:
route cause analysis should be undertaken into the gross I TP/AJ
losses/gains and net balances as these seemed very high
(paragraph 8 of the paper). (Tim Perkins and Amanda Jones to
consider for update at the next Committee meeting).

The Committee NOTED the update on balances posted to Postmaster
customer accounts following a request at the Committee in September
2020.

10. Postmaster Policies

10.1 Amanda Jones introduced the paper, which had been circulated
previously and was taken as read. It was explained that these three
policies were being proposed to formalise the improvements made to a
number of processes in response to the CIJ. Each policy was taken in
turn:

The Chair questioned
why the Risk Appetite section was missing. It was confirmed that
the risk appetite was averse, but that this linked back to the
earlier discussion regarding the risk appetite statement for
Postmasters and the need for clear KRIs, which were particularly
required to judge if the policy was being embedded and enforced.
This section should be added into the policy in line with the work
to be completed on KRIs for Postmasters (see action above in
paragraph 4.2).

ACTION:
TP/AI/
MB

ACTION:

There was also an action to carefully consider references to TP/AJ

“employee” throughout the document.

It was also confirmed that this was an internal policy (not
Postmaster facing), but a similar version would be created as
part of the Postmaster manual. It was explained there would be
an overarching document demonstrating how the policies fit I ACTION:
together and it was agreed this would be presented to the I TP/AJ

Committee in March 2021 with the Chair requesting that it be
clear in this document who was the audience of which policy.

- Postmaster Account Support Policy: ay

A different approach was being taken by the
former loss recovery team, which was to be supportive and
understanding of discrepancies.

It was explained that the three policies interfaced to provide
support to Postmasters. The Network Monitoring policy related to

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 16

POL-0018094
@

POST OFFICE LIMITED

POL00021464
POL00021464

investigation, Account Support was for proactive support and
Dispute Resolution sets out the tiers of support provided in the
event of a discrepancy (section 4 of the policy).

The Chair questioned the wording of the risk appetite section and
it was requested that this was reviewed before the policy was
published/implemented.

With respect to the writing off of discrepancies, it was explained
that the team were working hard to reduce the number and size
of discrepancies. There were no caps on amounts that could be
written off over a period of time as the controls to approve the
write offs ultimately formed part of the finance processes.

Tom Cooper questioned whether after the Tier 3 support level
(section 4 of the policy) litigation was the only option,
considering that the amount could be small. Tim Perkins
explained that the account support processes were used to
consider how the discrepancy should be dealt with and whether
it should be written off, with a lot of engagement with the
Postmaster. Where there were persistent losses or carelessness,
then this would be dealt with from a contractual performance
perspective i.e. termination on notice.

The Committee requested that the following elements were

included in the policy:

1. A suggested timetable for decision-making;

2. Who would be involved in making decisions under Tier 3
(indicating that it should be people of appropriate seniority);

3. Information that would be provided to the Postmaster through
the dispute resolution process (i.e. accounting records,
Horizon data etc.);

4. Reference to classroom training that would be provided to
Postmasters on investigating balance discrepancies; and

5. A checklist for each tier.

Zarin Patel (by email outside of the meeting) also raised the following
points:
i.

Both the Postmaster Account Support Policy (para 2.5 and
4.1) and the Network Monitoring and Audit Support Policy
(para 2.5) referred to “reasonable and fair investigations”
without adequately defining this; and

The Network Monitoring and Audit Support Policy should

audit with preconceived biases.

Accordingly, the following policies were APPROVED by the Committee:

wording of the risk appetite section and addition of a definition
of a “reasonable and fair investigation”); and

e Network Monitoring and Audit Support Policy (subject to the
addition of a risk appetite section and a definition of a

attitude of the lead auditors and how the new culture would be
embedded).

The Postmaster Accounting Dispute Resolution Policy was to be revised
in line with the Committee's discussions (including a review of all risk
appetite references) and approved by written resolution after the
meeting.

11. Historical Matters Unit: Fraudulent Claims Controls & Delegation
of Authority

11.1 Declan Salter and Graham Hemingway introduced the paper which had
been circulated previously and taken as read. The key points were
highlighted as:

- Responsibilities, accountabilities and decision-making
authorities: Work was being done to produce an operating
charter and a RACI, including delegated authorities and
accountabilities. This has taken longer due to engagement with
BEIS and UK Government Investments (UKGI). A ways of
working document has been agreed, but a decision-making flow
chart was still being updated. Once complete, it was to be I ACTION:
circulated to the Board at its CCRC meeting. Further discussions I GH/DS
were being held on reporting to BEIS/UKGI.
Mitigations against risk of fraudulent claims:

Project team as set out in
appendix 1 of the report. By way of email outside the meeting,
Zarin Patel suggested that the team consider best practice for
fraudulent claim controls, such as those used for Payment
Protection Insurance (PPI) claims. Graham Hemmingway
provided the following response: the mitigations have been
compiled and reviewed by his team, which included programme
and project managers as well as business analysts with
experience of managing PPI-type claim schemes at Lloyds
Banking Group, Barclays, Nationwide, RBS and Co-op Bank.
Further Declan Salter’s experience has also fed into the ongoing
risk management activities, particularly around risk of
interception of emails. Internal Audit or an external team could
review the mitigations as part of their planned reviews.

Stamps Scheme) and that controls were in place to confirm the

12. IT Controls Assessment

12.1 Tony Jowett introduced the paper, which had been circulated previously
and was taken as read. The main focus of work in the IT Controls was
the Internal Audit Report actions and focus of the improvement effort
was on the controls of greatest risk, namely those areas connected with
the management of the third-party estate through the lens of Post
Office’s crown jewel systems. The Committee requested that there be
a detailed review of this, and this review would be reported to the I ACTION:
Committee, targeting the next meeting. Tj

On resource constraints flagged by the Internal Audit report, Tony
Jowett further explained that the size of the team had been doubled

and someone had been appointed to the business continuity role but
was not yet in post.

The Committee NOTED the status and plans regarding the reduction of
risk associated with IT Controls.

*Outside of the meeting, Tom Cooper requested that paragraph 18
needed to be amended to remove the following line: “There is a UKGI
representative on the POL Board, who have oversight of the Group
Executive ("GE”) and are able to challenge and review relevant
decisions made by the AP and the GE team" as his role on the Board
was not linked to the role of the Accountable Person.

** Subsequent to the meeting, Tom Cooper questioned whether power
outages (affecting label printing) had implications for the integrity of
branch accounting and accuracy of postmaster balances. Declan Salter
has confirmed that, absent fraudulent activity, there would be no
financial loss. Furthermore, that, in this regard, there are no system
related integrity issues.

- Paragraph 25 relating to the risk of prolonged industrial action as
this should refer to pace of response rather than the risk of material
long term industrial action; and

- Paragraph 27 relating to adverse external economic factors, noting
that much of this was outside Post Office’s control and that, some
elements had upsides for Post Office.

Mark Baldock was asked to review these sections, discuss further with Ken
McCall and provide an update for the next Committee meeting

Compliance Update: Ken McCall noted that the report outlined that there
had been changes to the Postmaster Onboarding process and questioned
whether this meant the onboarding process was quicker. Jonathan Hill was
asked to confirm this point for update at the next meeting.

Compliance Update: In response to questions from Ken McCall raising
concerns about the wording of this section in the report (paragraph 11),
it was confirmed that it was the mapping of processes for activities
addressing the CIJ that had no consistent approach, rather than the
controls themselves. Key was evidence of controls and a consistency of
approach. The HMU team was working with the relevant business areas to
address this. However, the Chair asked Jonathan Hill to further consider
before the next meeting any underlying issues (not just related to
mapping), what controls were in place and whether or not they were
appropriate.

to do this, and it was requested that Tim Perkins provide the date as to

Postmaster Policies: The Committee requested that the following
elements were included in the policy:

1. A suggested timetable for decision-making;

2. Who would be involved in making decisions under Tier 3
(indicating that it should be people of appropriate seniority);

3. Information that would be provided to the Postmaster through
the dispute resolution process (i.e. accounting records, Horizon
data etc.);

4. Reference to classroom training that would be provided to
Postmasters on investigating balance discrepancies; and

5. A checklist for each tier.

Postmaster Policies: Zarin Patel (by email outside of the meeting) also
raised the following points:

i. Both the Postmaster Account Support Policy (para 2.5 and 4.1)
and the Network Monitoring and Audit Support Policy (para 2.5)
referred to “reasonable and fair investigations” without
adequately defining this; and

ii. The Network Monitoring and Audit Support Policy should address
skill set and attitude of lead auditors and how the new culture
would be embedded so they did not approach the audit with
preconceived biases.
