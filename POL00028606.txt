Following the then Chief Secretary’s letter to colleagues of 23 December,
Lord Falconer had further discussions with Mr Darling and Mr McCartney.
{t seemed to him that there was a basis for agreement on the way
forward with the Horizon’ project and the desirability of achieving
- improvements. to .the technology. which can be. delivered within. the
comme: pial terms of the contract with ICL.

Over the Christmas holidays, Ministers agreed that it would be helpful for °
officials from DSS, DTI, POCL, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office to
work up a menu of items for discussion with ICL with a view to securing ~*
the improvements referred to in Stephen Byers’ letter of 23 December. I

understand that DTI officials are making arrangements’ for a meeting (2
towards the end of ‘this week which should Produce a paper for
consideration by Ministers at their next meeting in the week beginning 11

January. .
