5 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This section lists the identifier of each Acceptance Criterion that will be
demonstrated by the Acceptance Test. It also lists the Acceptance Test Conditions
that are used to determine whether (or not) the Acceptance Criterion has been met
together with the applicable test Phase, Technical Test, or Live Trial.

Acceptance Criteria are split into three sets of tables according to the nature of the
acceptance method, one set for those tested by Acceptance Trial, a second for those
tested by Acceptance Review and a third which lists those criteria which are for
Acceptance at a later release. The Release on which Acceptance is to be conducted
is defined by reference to the Release Contents Description included in the
Associated Documents section of the Acceptance Specification. Exceptionally, it
may be necessary for one particular Acceptance Criterion to be tested by a
combination of trial and review in which case there are entries for Trial and Review.

5.1. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND TEST CONDITIONS

Conformance of the Audit Acceptance Criteria will be demonstrated through
Acceptance Trials and/or Acceptance Reviews.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Trials comprise practical tests using prepared test
scripts. If applicable the Test Condition(s) appropriate to a criterion are specified
in section 5.1.1 together with a description of the test. Detailed composition of the
test in terms of sequences of Test Conditions is contained in Section 10. In the
tables in section 5.1.1 the rows labelled Function Run Entry will be populated
immediately prior to the running of the Acceptance Trials in a working version of
the Acceptance Specification. These will provide invigilators with references to the
checklists used to monitor the progress of the testing. The order of running of Test
Conditions will not necessarily correspond to the order presented in HLTPs
because of the “physicalisation” of the testing. The Function Run Entry will allow
the invigilator to read across from the criterion to the checklist.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Review comprise typically document reviews, site
visits or presentations. If applicable the Test Condition(s) are described in section
5.1.2.

6. ACCEPTANCE INCIDENT SEVERITY

This section identifies the guidelines to be applied during the analysis of
Acceptance Incidents, in order to establish the severity of such Acceptance
Incidents.

64 HIGH SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a substantive impact on
the service received by the Customer, e.g. failure to pay benefits to the right person,
at the right place, at the right time.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a major impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where
there was a major impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES
necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. failure to support
accurate POCL accounting.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the
service where there is no acceptable procedural workaround.

Consistent failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels, e.g.
where particular transactions do not meet the minimum Acceptable Threshold
under normal loading.

6.2 I MEDIUM SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is visible to the Customer and is
likely to give rise to an adverse public perception of the service, but does not
substantively impact the service received by the Customer, e.g. incorrect spelling
on a receipt.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a medium impact on
the ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or
where there was a medium impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or
AUTHORITIES necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-
production of a weekly report, resulting in its manual transcription, which causes
additional resource or effort at every outlet of the average duration of one hour per
week per outlet.

Occasional failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels, e.g.
at peak loading, some transactions fail to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds,
but on average all transactions within the service do achieve Minimum Acceptable
Thresholds.

6.3. LOWSEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion that is neither visible to nor has
substantive impact on the service received by the Customer e.g. presentational,
style and other cosmetic faults that are only visible to the user.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a minor impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where
there was a minor impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES
necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-production of a
weekly report, resulting in its manual transcription, which causes additional
resource or effort at ten or fewer outlets of the average duration of one hour per
week per outlet.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the
service but where the workaround is as secure as the original solution (i.e. the only
impact on risk is in ensuring that the workaround is performed, but where
procedures have been agreed and are in place).
