It can confirm that on 23rd Feb, node 1 (not 2), user BJAQ03 remmed in Swiss francs, and £80 of 2p coins.

ach barcode appears to have been scanned just once, but the 2p coins transaction wae added to the basket twice, and two identical
heceipts were printed for the coins rem in.

I''m downgrading the call to B because this problem is not preventing them from trading, but I am continuing to investigate.

Pouch 399345086528, £80 2p coins, was accepted twice at branch 506246 on 23rd February, due to a system problem when the clerk usedI
he Prev button several times during the Delivery acceptance.

this has caused them a loss of £80. They cannot reverse this transaction. The pouch acceptance will show up twice in POLFS as well.

passing call to MSU to inform POL via BIMS - can they issue a TC? (I did initially advise the PM to contact NBSC but she was not
onfident that this would result in an action being taken).

Please then return call to me so I can pass it on to development.

luring pouch delivery, When barcode is scanned and hit enter it will land in print/preview/late date page. By this time, the syster
lreates a list of valid barcodes to be processed.

aut while in print/preview/late date page, prev is hit (or) during entering barcodes the cursor is brought to text box where a
uch is already entered and then proceeded furthur, this issue occurs, because of the usage of prev button the pdl engine may
clone the pouch list objects.

le propose to disable the prev button when a valid pouch id is entered in the first page of pouch delivery.

Wwe also noticed that in print/preview/late date page, when print was initially selected(when first pouch receipt was printed), the
ev should be disabled, this is not happening. The prev button is disabled only when preview is done and second pouch receipt is

printed. This should also be fixed.

(Eo:05-Mar-2010 08:03:08 User: customer Call_
Fre have received notification from POL regarding the problems at this office.

SB
mn the 1st of March at the close of business we found that on node 5 the cash was short of £1000. All of the figures for that day
atch the figures presented at the time of each transactions. An instant saver withdrawal for £1000 was transacted that day, but 1
las unable to find this transaction using the online report facility. I feel very anxious as I believe a system error has occurred
ht the time of this transaction.

In the 2nd of March a transaction for a cash withdrawal was completed where the system commanded a member of staff to issue the
froney to the customer on screen but the receipt printed for that transaction printed out a decline slip. The customer was honest
enough to bring back the decline receipt a day later with the money.

n the 2nd of March on node 5 a £220 cash deposit was authorised on screen but twenty minutes later the customer brought back a
receipt that stated the transaction had declined. We contacted the NBSC as and when the customer produced the receipt. The NBSC
stated that the transaction approved on the system and had no idea why the money was not deposited and why the decline slip was

rinted.

rem was scanned in our system and all figures had doubled up. The helpline team was notified at the time to which they seemed
jore confused as to why it happened than me!

Another error occurred on the system when 10 items of postage seemed to disappear for no reason half way through a customer's i
transaction. The system commanded no money to be taken from the customer on screen or by receipt.

transaction on node 2 where a car tax was entered disappeared; the system was not even being uséd when the tax information
Hisappeared from the system as the clerk who was processing the transaction was writing the details of the vehicle on the tax disc!
ithe help desk team simply regarded the matter as a glitch. We were told to complete the transaction again.
[he Helpline team seem not to be sure of any query we bring to them, they are guarded to take ownership to any problem and never
lreply to any calls. It is a shame as the only person we get results with is Garry Elenor which makes no sense as he is part of the
jorizon training team.

since the four days of closure we have lost over £5000 to date. This includes staff wages, retail closure, combined salary and
losses incurred on the counters.

tt has been noted when speaking to a helpline representative in Bangalore our servers are not online all the time and communicatingI
5 there is a software problem. Our cash declarations have not once been received since the new system has taken over.

j@ have no idea when the system will crash and for how long it crashes. Our customers are very upset with the way our business now
trades, as our office had a very low rate of closure which now seems to have spiralled out of control!

i really wish that the new system was not undertaken in our office as it is adding stress on the customers ourselves and our staff.
Ii have a deep reqret in initially volunteering to take part in this new pilot scheme, as I did not expect to have these
complications with such poor services from the helpline.

Infortunately our migration officer is away (Garry Elanor ) leaving us with no one with the means to correct our issue today.

Why should it be my liability to recoup all the losses in this already declining business, when these systems should have adequate
lontingencies for any such problems that could or would arrive. It seems that the helpline have left me for seven hours now without]
ny intention of calling us back as no one again wants to take ownership over this problem.

SME Review:

t've not looked at the patch - I'm looking at the problem first, really. I understand that marking the screen is
"setSignificant (false)" might solve the problem, but this means the user is unable to go back and scan more barcodes, and has to
start from scratch. It also means they have no way of confirming what barcodes they have scanned (a number appears in history, but
ot the actual barcodes) «

i've looked at the flow through the use-case, and the Retry button on MSG00055 seems wrong (according to Gareth, and I'd agree) -
the retry button takes you back to the same screen (Print/Preview/Late), hence why the pinch point is not picked up. But in any
case, retries should be handled by the printing, not by the use-case. If manual confirmation that the print was successful, then
that option can be passed into the print system as well.

It notice that MSG00055 is used by three PDLs:
ecordPouchReversal .pdl

RecordPreparat ion0fPouchesForCollect ion.pdl
isplayPouchOptions.pdl

bo this logic may be wrong in several places.

It also note that it's only after both pouch receipts are printed that the pinch point is set, and all is OK - prev is disabled.

i also note that _the pouch is added to the basket as soon as it is scanned - this means that even before you get to the

FUJ00081865
FUJ00081865

"Print/Preview/late™ screen there 18 a problem with prev here:
for example:

scan barcode => into basket
rev
scan barcode again -> goes into basket again

then we end up with the same pouch recorded twice.

I've talked this through with Gareth and Ric, and the conclusion is that we should ensure that once a barcode has been
successfully* entered (and gone into the basket), then we should set a pinch point (but ensure that Cancel is still enabled to
low use-case to be abandoned). This will mean the MSG00055 Retry button doesn't really cause us any issues, and can be dealt with
hater as a lower priority peak.

je must ensure that if the user enters a barcode that is not valid, and requires c
correct it.

erection, the user should be allowed to still

jote that this proposal is not too dissimilar to what is being suggested — setSigificant (false) v setPinchPoint(...) is just a
slightly different way of avoiding re-adding the same pouch to the basket twice.

It tried to set up pinchpoint in two ways :

Inder the line obtainPouchBarcodeBLO.invoke("start", barcodeParams); in RecordPouchDeliveryBLO the below two cases are tried -

h. adcController.setPinchPoint (); is added.
mn first attempt when invalid barcode is added and validation fails, the prev button is disabled. No pouch was added to basket yet.
b. if (validPouches.size()>0) { adcController.setPinchPoint ();

3
[the prev in this case will not be disabled until a pouch is added to the basket. But when on first attempt an invalid pouch id is
entered and prev is hit, it is taking to the screen where the previous barcode is entered in text box with barcode present. This ig
bserved for all invalid barcode entries. Each prev will take to invalid barcode page with the barcode present in the text box.

Ihe point I think the pinch point needs to be is just after adding to the basket when the barcode is scanned - and only if it is
not. found in the system already.

in RecordPouchDeliveryBLO.pdl, start method, try adding 4 pinch point at this point:

## pinch point here - on this line??
fiog.debug("Not found in DB: " + pouchBarcode + " Needs to capture detaile....");

i've not tried it, but this would seem like a good first stab.

his sets the pinch point if a) it's not found in the system, but b) has been added to the basket
