THE POST OFFICE GROUP LITIGATION
IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE

QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION
BETWEEN:
ALAN BATES & OTHERS
Claimants
AND
POST OFFICE LIMITED
Defendant

POST OFFICE'S RESPONSE TO CLAIMANTS'
INFORMATION REQUESTS MADE ON 4 MARCH 2019

Overarching Response

On 4 March 2019, the Claimants' Requests for Extended Disclosure were served, which included seventeen
questions about the types of documents used by Post Office and where they might be held (Information
Requests). Post Office's objections to the Requests for Extended Disclosure were provided on 15 March 2019,
pursuant to paragraph 3.3 of the Seventh CMC Order. As explained in WBD's letter of 15 March 2019, Post Office
does not consider that the Requests for Extended Disclosure pursuant to PD 51U was the appropriate method for
the Claimants to make information requests, however it was recognised that the Claimants were seeking clarity on
how best to target their Stage 5 Disclosure requests. Post Office therefore confirmed that it would be willing to offer
responses to the information requests, despite there being no Court order requiring Post Office to do so.

Post Office has sought to clarify with the Claimants a number of the information requests. Post Office has not
received any substantive response to the clarifications sought as set out in WBD's letters dated 1 April 2019, 19
August 2019 and 29 August 2019. Following these letters, the Claimants responded on 30 August 2019 stating that
due to the change of scope of the Further Issues Trial, it was not proportionate for the Claimants to focus resource
on answering Post Office's queries. Therefore, responses to the information requests on which Post Office has
sought clarification, including in relation to the expanded date range request from the Claimants, are being treated
as closed at this stage of the litigation.

Some of the information requested dates back over 19 years and seeks precise details of custodians and document
involved in certain activities. It has been difficult for Post Office to identify exactly who held specific roles within the
business and the documents they may have produced due to the passage of time. Post Office has made
reasonable and proportionate enquiries to find the information requested but it cannot warrant that this information
is completely accurate given the passage of time. Nevertheless, it should be practically useful to the Claimants
when they are formulating future disclosure requests.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637, HQ17X04248

Information Request —- NBSC
helpline and representations
alleged:

A1: Provide copies of all indexes,
schedules and lists comprising
categories or folders/document titles
enabling all NBSC call scripts and
reference articles to be identified,
searched and inspected.

As explained in WBD's letter of 15 March 2019, this Information Request
duplicates the Stage 4 Disclosure Requests A4, F8/F9, H20/H21 and
K29.

Post Office objected to providing further information in response to this
request since the Claimants were seeking information on documents that
Post Office had agreed to disclose (and which have now been disclosed
as part of Stage 4 Disclosure).

WBD's letter of 19 August 2019 maintained this objection and requested
clarification from the Claimants as to why information was sought to
identify documents which Post Office had already agreed to disclose. No
response has been received to this request for clarification and therefore
this request is considered closed.

A2: Information on the types of
documents generated by Post Office
which contain high level statistics
and reports supplied to Senior
Management relating to:

(a) the nature and extent of issues
raised with NBSC by branches;

(b) the nature and categorisation of
NBSC responses to enquiries by
branches; and

(c) issues raised by branches
regarding alleged shortfalls,
discrepancies or losses.

The information to be provided is.
limited to the timeframes identified in
Mrs Stubbs and Mr Abdulla’s IPOCS,
giving a date range of January 2007
to August 2010.

Between 2000 and 2014, Post Office stored information concerning the
calls made by postmasters to the NBSC in a system called Remedy.
Reports could be run on the information stored within Remedy to, for
example, group together the calls made that month on particular topics.
Remedy had multiple users across Post Office who were able to run such
reports.

The reporting function of Remedy is the most likely tool to have been
used by Post Office to report to Senior Management on (a) the nature and
extent of issues raised with NBSC by branches and (b) the nature and
categorisation of NBSC responses to enquiries by branches. Our current
understanding is that there was no protocol for saving the reports which
were run from Remedy into a centralised document repository.

Post Office has not been able to recall or locate details of a formal
process between January 2007 and August 2010 for regular reporting to
Senior Management on the matters (a) to (c) nor any specific categories
of documents within which high level statistics and reports on matters (a)
to (c) were recorded. We understand that reporting was more likely to
have been ad hoc or on the basis of volumes of calls, length of calls and
time periods between initial calls to the resolution of the issue raised by
the Live Service Incident Management Team.

We have not been able to identify a specific category of document used
by the Live Service Incident Management Team to report to Senior
Management. Communications from this team depended on the incident
they were reporting on under the Major Incident Management Process
(set out in Response F12).

We have identified the individuals who may have undertaken such
reporting in Response A3.

have liaised with Senior Management between 2007 and 2010.
The team of approximately 8 —- 10 members reported to the
Systems and Direct Channels Operations Team and Service Desk
and Continuity Team. We understand the Live Service Incident
Management team had a general reporting function, although not
NBSC specific, and carried out analysis of call data to determine
trends which may have been reported to Senior Management on
an ad hoc basis.

The individuals from the Branch Support Services Team who may have
had responsibility for creating high level statistics and reports between
January 2007 to August 2010 for Senior Management were:

1. Andrew Kenny
2. Anne Allaker (Change and Improvement Manager, Branch and
Customer Support)

The individuals from NBSC who may have had responsibility for creating
high level statistics and reports for Senior Management between
January 2007 to August 2010 were:

Jill Kennedy (NBSC Manager)

A4: Please provide a description of As explained in WBD's second letter of 18 May 2018, which concerned
the types of documents stored on Stage 2 Disclosure for the Common Issues Trial, Post Office undertook
the ‘N:Drive’ relevant to the NBSC investigations during this stage of disclosure to map the Post Office
employees who used the "N Drive" and to understand the documents
which were stored in this location. Our fifth letter of 23 July 2018
confirmed that "During our investigations to locate the identity of the N
Drive, it has come to our attention that Post Office's NBSC team practice
is to store documents in the P Drive." We are therefore proceeding on
the basis that information sought by the Claimants is in relation to the
documents stored on the P Drive.

The P Drive is a team document repository used by the NBSC with the
file path:

Our understanding is that the P Drive is used as a central storage
location for documents by the NBSC.

Please find below a screenshot of the contents of the P Drive.

Information Request —
Information held by Post Office

B7: Identify the teams from those
listed in Appendix B to the
Defendant's EDQ and the
custodians within those teams, who
were responsible for deciding what
information should be
communicated to the branch
network:

7.1 by the NBSC helpline
regarding alleged shortfalls,
discrepancies or losses;

7.2 by the Defendant to the branch
network by means of the document
categories referred to in Request
AG (a), (b), (c) and (d);

7.3 by the Defendant to external
(non-postmaster) third parties,
including but not limited to press
releases, announcements, media
communications and
communications with MPs.

The information to be provided is
limited to January 2007 to August
2010.

In response to B7.1

e POL Core Information Management Team was established
around 2005 and was in place throughout the relevant period. The
team had approximately 6 members. The POL Core Information
Management Team liaised with the NBSC and product managers,
both of whom would advise the POL Core Information Management
Team on the contents of the KBAs used by the call handlers (where
such input was required), for example on the introduction of a new
product or service.

Wendy Schofield and James Unsworth were key contacts within
the POL Core Information Management Team who may have been
responsible for deciding what information should be communicated
to the branch network by the NBSC via KBAs, along with the product
manager (which would change depending on the contents of the
communication).

In response to B7.2

e Werefer you to paragraphs 5.1 — 5.22 of WBD's letter of 30 August
2019. Each Counter News, Operational Focus, Branch Focus and
Memoview identifies an author. The Memoview request forms also
list whom that particular Memoview has been reviewed by before it
is submitted to Fujitsu to be communicated to the branch network. It
should be noted that the authors of those publications may not
necessarily be the individuals responsible for deciding what was
communicated to the branch network, but merely the authors of
these documents.

Each of these types of operational updates were used to
communicate matters to the branch network. The teams and
individuals involved in deciding what information should be
communicated to the branch network, save for the overarching
Communications Team, will vary depending on the individual topic
being communicated. Over 5,600 operational updates were
disclosed in Stage 4 Disclosure. As you will see from the volume of
operational updates, it is not reasonable nor proportionate to
ascertain for each article in each publication which team / individual
decided what should be communicated. However, if following
inspection there is any particular article(s) that you would like further
information about, we can look into that article further.

In response to B7.3

e Post Office are waiting clarification from the Claimants on the
meaning of RFI 7.3.

In the meantime we understand that between 2007 to 2010, David
Simpson of Royal Mail was the Press Office lead and Mich Fisher of
Royal Mail was the Public Affairs lead. We understand these
contacts both left Royal Mail several years ago.

errors or defects

F12: A list of all teams, and named
custodians within such teams, with
responsibility for deciding whether
any matters of the nature referred

to in GPOC §23, §24 or §25 would
or should be communicated to the
branch network.

The matters are:

A: software coding errors, bugs or
defects and data or data packet
errors which required fixes, which
had the potential to produce
shortfalls (paras 23 and 24 GPOC);

B: knowledge that Fujitsu:

was able to alter branch data
directly (para 25 GPOC)

was able to carry out changes to
Horizon and/ or transaction data
which could affect branch accounts
(para 25 GPOC)

C: knowledge that Horizon:

had "insufficient error repellency"
(para 24 GPOC)

was “imperfect and had the
potential for creating errors" (para
24 GPOC)

The information to be provided is
limited to the date ranges of July
2000 to August 2010.

General response

We refer you to Post Office's response to Request B7 and paragraphs 5.1
to 5.22 of WBD's letter of 30 August 2019 regarding the processes for
communications being sent out to the branch network between 2000 to
2010.

The following teams may have had responsibility for deciding whether the
matters referred to in §23, §24 and §25 of the GPOC would or should be

Escalation Group; Business Protection Team and selective Service
Outage Groups . We refer you to POL-0081287 and POL-0217803.

2) Branch and IT Systems Team — from 2011 onwards, we understand
that this team would have been responsible for the production and
circulation of weekly technical incidents reports which were emailed to
four senior custodians, being:

(a) I Alan Simpson: Security Operations, Security Manager
(2011/2012) & ISAG Compliance Support Manager (2013)

(b) Dave King: Business Support Manager (2011/2012) & Security

f Laura Darby, IT & Change, Service Management Support (2012)

‘g) Emma Langfield, IT & Change, Post Office Service Desk (2013)

h) Julie Edgley, IT & Change, Post Office Service Desk (2013)

3) Executive Team

We refer to management structure provided on 29 March 2018. As
explained at paragraph 6.3, the Group Executive Team's role was to
develop and monitor deployment of the Group's strategy and consider
overall performance of the Group. In this role, the Group Executive Team
may have been responsible for deciding whether any matters of the
nature referred to in GPOC §23, §24 or §25 would or should be
communicated to the branch network. As explained at para 2.1, the
Group Executive comprises of individuals who held certain roles (albeit
that the titles of those roles has changed over time). Numerous
individuals will have held these roles and therefore been part of the
Group Executive Team over the relevant time period.

4) Network wide communications

If the incident affected the entire branch network, the branch network may
have been updated by way of a Memoview. We refer to Post Office's
response to Request B7.2 which explains the teams/custodians
responsible for the matters to be communicated to the branch network.

F13: A description or list of all
categories of document produced,
held or retained by the custodians

The information to be provided is
limited to the date ranges of July
2000 to August 2010.

It is our understanding that the following categories of documents were
produced, held or retained by the custodians identified at F12 in which
decisions of the type referred to at F12 may have been recorded,
reported or communicated within Post Office (some of which have
already been disclosed by Post Office in Stage 3 Disclosure):

1) Root Cause Analysis Report (RCA Report) created by Fujitsu;

refer you to paragraphs 4.2 and 11.3 of WBD's letter of 30 August 2010.

G15: A description or list of all
categories of document produced,
held or retained by the custodians
identified pursuant to Request G14
above by which decisions (of the
type referred to in G14 above) were
recorded, reported or
communicated within the
Defendant company.

We note the Claimants' request sought information in relation to “all
categories of documents". This request is therefore too broad and Post
Office has sought to provide a reasonable and proportionate response.

We understand from documents already disclosed in Stages 2 and 4 of
Disclosure (see paragraph 11 of WBD's letter of 30 August 2019) as
produced by the custodians identified under Request G14 that the
following categories of documents may record, report or communicate to
persons within RFI G14 (a) to (c) matters referred to in GPOC §23, §24,
§25, §31.3, §31.4 and §31.5:

The information to be provided is

limited to the date ranges of July a) ACCs (we refer you to class 43 of documents disclosed by Post
2000 to August 2010. Office in Stage 2 disclosure, as set out in WBD's letter of 18 May
2018);

b) auditors'/ investigators’ pro forma documents which would be
completed at an audit (such as Event Capture Forms);

c) auditors'/ investigators’ pro forma documents which would be
completed if an investigation was carried out before/ after an audit;

d) training materials.

We refer you to paragraphs 4.2 and 11.3 of WBD's letter of 30 August
2019. Prior to separation from Royal Mail in 2012, training was given to
auditors, investigators and contracts advisors by Royal Mail Trainers. If
for example a training aide-memoir needed to be updated, this would be
updated by Royal Mail Trainers. As these custodians and the class of
documents are generally outside of Post Office's control, Royal Mail has
not been referenced as a custodian in G14 above.

Information Request — handling
concerns about Horizon

G19: In so far as Requests G16, 17
and 18 relate to documents already
disclosed to the Claimants, please
identify (by reference to their
existing disclosure ID (POL-[xxx])
the documents which are relevant
to Requests G16, 17 and 18.

As explained in WBD's letter of 15 March 2019, this request required Post
Office to incur the costs of identifying documents which have already
been disclosed in the Common Issues and Horizon Trials in relation to
Requests G16 — G18.

WBD's letter of 19 August 2019 maintained this objection and requested
clarification from the Claimants on how the Claimants believed that the
identification of documents using de-duplication could be achieved. In
any event, we refer to WBD's letter of 28 June 2018 which identifies a
number of documents which may fall within Requests G16 to G18 and the
methods by which the Claimants could locate further similar documents.
which have already been disclosed.

No response has been received to this request for clarification and so this
request is considered complete.

Information Request — policies
on the provision of transaction
data

H22: A list of all custodians, and
teams of which they formed a part
with responsibility for the
formulation and communication of
any policy or guidance produced
between January 2007 and August
2010 in respect of requests made
by postmasters for:

(a) transaction, event or session
data;

(b) ARQs;

[(c) error notices — NB error
notices fall outside of the agreed
date range and so have not been
addressed in the Response];

(d) transaction corrections or error
notices issued.

In response to Request H22, parts (a) and (b):

It should be noted that transaction and event data is another name for
ARQ data.

We understand that it is / was rare in practice for a Subpostmaster to
request ARQ data.

If a request for ARQ data was made by a Subpostmaster, it would most
likely be made to a Subpostmaster's contract adviser or via the NBSC
helpline and so these form the likely group of relevant custodians.

We refer you to paragraph 18.4 of WBD's letter of 30 August 2019.
Session data was not available until the Post Office used a system called
Horice in early/ mid 2014 and therefore no information has been provided
in respect of the custodian/teams with responsibility for the formulation
and communication of any policy or guidance in respect of requests made
by postmasters for session data as this falls outside the agreed date
range.

In response to Request H22, part (d):

It is not clear what information the Claimants are seeking in relation to
Transaction Corrections.

We have therefore interpreted this request to mean "which custodians,
and teams of which they formed a part had responsibility for the
formulation and communication of any policy or guidance produced
between January 2007 and August 2010 in the issuing of Transaction
Corrections and responding to the Claimants’ queries in respect of
Transaction Corrections".

The teams involved in Transaction Corrections who may have had
responsibility for the formulation and communication of any policy or
guidance produced between January 2007 and August 2010 in the
issuing of Transaction Corrections and responding to the Claimants’
queries in respect of Transaction Corrections were:

J28: A list of categories of
document recording:

(a) the processes;

(b) policies or guidance; and

(c) implementation of the matters
described in Request J27 above.
The information to be provided is

limited to the date ranges of July
2000 to August 2010.

During the relevant time period, Post Office's Settlements and
Reconciliation Team used a bespoke accounting solution called Client
Ledger and Settlement System (CLASS). CLASS was used to create a
monthly trial client balance and the Settlements and Reconciliation Team
was responsible for explaining the balances on the client accounts.

Our understanding is that a series of reports would have been produced
by the Settlements and Reconciliation Team, one of which was a monthly
report called a "probity summary report".

Each appropriate product team was responsible for the balancing of the
probity within their area of control. Once balanced the probity report was
forwarded to the Probity Lead CSA. The Probity Lead CSA collated the
reports from product teams and forwarded the final probity report to
Finance and the Probity Lead STL. The Probity Lead STL compiled the
Probity Summary Report. The individuals who held these roles changed
numerous times during the 10 year relevant period and so have not been
identified.

The Settlements and Reconciliation Team would also receive a client
transaction summary from Fujitsu (CTS report) which was compared to
the client transaction balances pulled from CLASS, amongst a number of
other reports which were sent by Fujitsu to the Team daily, weekly and
monthly.
