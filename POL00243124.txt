Background
section setting out
history of Horizon
investigations

does not go to the substance of any claim.
However it should be addressed as it is a
twisted version of history that (i) taints any
other response by POL and (ii) sets a canvas
against which Post Office is then accused of
fraud and / or ignorance of issues with
Horizon.

We largely have this knowledge already so
little further investigation will be required.

COMPLETED

LOC B: Legal
relationship
between POL and
SPMRs.

This section looks to imply new duties on
POL. The aim is to reverse the burden on
SPMRs to investigate their own losses
(presumably because Freeths know that the
SPMRs cannot show any problem with
Horizon on their own).

Instruct Counsel to advise on analysis of
legal duties.
