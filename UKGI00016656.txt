5. The recent ShEx Board meeting had discussed the potential impact on portfolio
businesses in the event that Chief Executive roles became aligned to Accounting
Officer roles. This had happened on Royal Mint but no decisions had been taken for
other state-owned businesses. There was a concern that an Accounting Officer
function could be incompatible with Board decisions.

Action: Susannah to check how the decision to appoint an Accounting
Officer for Royal Mint was reached.
