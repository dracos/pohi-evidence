FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1. Introduction

This document comprises the HNG-X Acceptance Report to the HNG-X Acceptance Board for the
assessment of the progression through Release 2 Acceptance Gateway.

The basis for HNG-X Acceptance is defined in REQ/GEN/PRO/0735 — HNG-X Generic Acceptance
process and some sections are reproduced within this report.

[Note: This document is in review and has not yet been agreed / baselined, Any text and references
used in this document are taken from the version shown in section 0.4.]

The HNG-X Requirements and HNG-X Acceptance Criteria are contained in the HNG-X Requirements
Catalogue and represent POL DOORS archive v2.08.

Those HNG-X Acceptance Criteria allocated (in the HNG-X Acceptance Plan) to HNG-X Release 2 are
contained in Appendix A.

The definition of the HNG-X Acceptance Methods is contained in Appendix B.

The definition of the Acceptance Incident Severity is contained in Appendix C.

1.1. Scope
The purpose of this Acceptance Board is: -

‘To agree the Acceptance status of the relevant Release (HNG-X Release 2) and provide a
recommendation to the ‘Joint Release Authorisation Board'.’ The proposed options that this Board can
select from are described in Appendix D.

This recommendation is based on an assessment of the status of the applicable POL Requirements on
Fujitsu and Acceptance Criteria and of the stage progression criteria for the Release 2 Acceptance
Gateway.

The primary assessment concerns the status of all Acceptance Incidents, the workarounds required and
all applicable HNG-X Rectification Plans or target rectification timescales as follows:-

Progression through the HNG-X Release 2 Acceptance Gateway shall occur once all of the
following have been satisfied for the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria allocated to achieving
progression through the respective HNG-X Acceptance Gateway:

(a) subject to sections 5.4.1.4 and section 6 of REQ/GEN/PRO/0735 (which refers to dispute
handling, defect aggregation and delayed tests), all such HNG-X Acceptance Criteria have been
achieved;

(b) there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance Incidents;

(c) the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents is five or fewer
and:-

i. an agreed workaround exists for each of them

ii. an agreed HNG-X Rectification Plan exists for each of them unless, exceptionally, the
parties agree that this is not required

(d) there is an agreed workaround for all outstanding HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance
Incidents except for those which the Parties agree do not require a workaround, and:-

FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

i. there exists a target timescale for rectification except where the parties agree that this
is not required

(e) details of all Non Incidents are recorded, although they shall have no impact upon
Acceptance Gateway progression

These together with other supporting factors are summarised in the following checklist for Release 2
Acceptance.

It should be noted that there are also defects that have been identified during Release 2 testing that are
not linked to POL Requirements and which are not the subject of Acceptance Incidents. These have
been reviewed as part of the overall Release 2 defect deferral process and the status and significance of
these will be available for consideration at the Release Authorisation Board.

1.2 HNG-X Rectification Plans

All Acceptance Incidents will have an agreed workaround except those for which the Parties agree such a
workaround is not required.

Each Low Severity Acceptance Incident will have a target timescale for rectification except those for
which the Parties agree such a target timescale is not required.

Each Medium Severity Acceptance Incident will have an HNG-X Rectification Plan except where the
Parties agree that a rectification plan is not required. Each rectification plan will include:-

(a) A statement of the operational impact and any necessary temporary procedures to be
adopted by the users

(b) A description of how the rectification is to be achieved; and
(c) A timetable for the rectification

The rectification plans for each of the Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents are contained in section
41.

2 Review of status of Acceptance Criteria

This section shows the status of the POL requirements for the Release 2 Acceptance Gateway. The
Requirements and Acceptance Criteria for Release 2 comprise functional requirements expressed as new
and changed Use Cases and ‘non-functional’ requirements, all of which are grouped under 11 areas of
Business Change formalised via a series of Commercial Terms (CT) documents. The tables below show
the status of the acceptance criteria for the requirements introduced via these CTs.

2.1 Functional Criteria for assessment at the R2 Acceptance
Gateway

There are 31 Use Cases which are new or changed at Release 2. Acceptance testing comprises the
subset of testing that addresses those ‘sections’ of a use case — i.e. a Primary, Sub-flow, Variation or
Exception that have changed at Release 2. The test status of these new or changed sections is as
follows:-

Key to Status

Delayed / Deferred Test - This identifies the number of criteria that are subject to ‘deferred test’ status.
See section 2.3.

Failed (Deferred Fix) - Each Failed Criteria that is subject to a deferred fix is shown in section 2.4.
Applicable defects are represented by an Acceptance Incident in section 3

Failed (No POL impact) - This status indicates that a criterion has one or more defects associated with it
that has not yet been resolved, but the defect does not have any POL Business Impact and does not
result in an Al. These defects are described in section 2.4.4.1.

I

Statement of Fact

The nature of the SOF acceptance criteria are such that they are self evident statements that do not
require any formal evidence. As such it has been assumed that they are Passed, and this status has
been advised to the POL stakeholder. If there is evidence of any non-conformance then a defect will be
raised and the requirement will be set to failed.

2.3 Delayed (Deferred) Test status

Section 5.4.1.4 of REQ/GEN/PRO/0735 acknowledges that there may be circumstances when previously
scheduled testing that was targeted for completion by this Acceptance Gateway cannot now take place.
Providing that this is not due to a contractual default by Fujitsu, and the parties agree, then the tests
associated with a POL requirement may be delayed — this is known in the contract as a ‘Deferred Test’.
Fujitsu are still obliged to carry out these ‘Deferred Tests’.

For this Acceptance Gateway, Either Fujitsu or Joint Test Team has requested that tests associated with
the following requirements are given this ‘Deferred Test’ status. Quality Centre does not record this
status and so the current QC status is shown for each criterion.

2.3.1

Delayed Test Status

The Joint Test Team has advised that testing of the following criteria will not complete before the R2
Acceptance Board. Accordingly they are to be given ‘Deferred Test’ status.

3.2 Rectification Target timescales for Low Severity Als

Post Office and Fujitsu have assessed all of the Release 2 Low Severity Als. Agreements have been
reached on the target timescale for rectification and this is expressed either in the form a time period or
as target release. In some cases a target rectification time is not required, either because the defect is
now closed, is for progression by POL or it is agreed that no rectification is required.

The target timescales are:-
1. Release 2 —- These defects have not yet completed R2 testing. They remain targeted for R2.
2. Release 2 Maintenance - target timescale is October 2010
3. Release 3 - target timescale is November 2010 / January 2011

Indicative timescales for these releases are shown above however these are subject to change and will
be formally agreed via the joint programme reviews (for the Functional releases) and via the Release
Management Form (for the maintenance releases).

The total number of individual Low Severity Als associated with these Target Releases / timescales is
summarised below and detailed in the embedded document below.

from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that would not prevent operation of
one or more of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or elements of the
Infrastructure, but would cause problems in the operational use of one or more
Transaction types.

Low The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that does not cause any adverse
operational impact in the use of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or an
element of the Infrastructure, or the HNG-X Acceptance Incident can be addressed by
a workaround without any adverse operational impact for Post Office.
