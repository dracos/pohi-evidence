Hi Glenda,
I have booked the Boothroyd Room for this meeting at 6pm. It is on the first floor here at Portcullis House.

James is speaking with Paula next week by phone. I wonder if it might be a good idea if Alice, Paula, Angela
and Alwen come and have a quick pre-meeting with James, say at 5.45 that evening? Could you run this past
Alice and let me know if this seems a good idea? It would be simply to check on any last minute details, run
through the agenda, and agree anything that needs final agreement.

Do let me know,

Kind regards
Janet
