Amber Alert

Meeting held with POL (Mike Young, Dave Smith and Mark Burley) which was very positive. Although disappointed they
have accepted the revised dates from the re-plan. Agreed that the next 6 weeks is critical to the plan and these will be
tracked closely with them.

A number of milestones were met since the last update, including the critical path milestone of starting RV Mig Cycle 2.
Other successes were around completion of SV&l Cycle 6 with good results, completing the validation of two factor
authentication on the RV Acc rig.

Next Action:

It is critical to get the LST rig in a position where we can start executing the deferred system tests and also that we get
more control on the clearance of PEAKs (defects).

Agree Key Milestones for next 6 weeks with POL — email sent to customer 14/06, awaiting response

PEAK clearance continues to be a challenge and we are awaiting confirmation that Infrastructure teams are

appropriate release — response for current release anticipated by cob today (08/06) and a response for all other
releases is anticipated by end of this week.
