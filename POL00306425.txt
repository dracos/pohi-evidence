(Geadlines
Operating profit before exceptional items in the month was £9.2m which is £4.5m favourable to budget. Year to
date profit of £24.5m is £4.1m adverse to budget and £13.4m adverse to prior year (including the NSP reduction of
£16.9m),

In the period net income is adverse to budget by £8.0m. This reflects the continuing shortfall in Mails and Retail
(mainly labels and delayed rollout of ebay returns) of £4.0m although the performance was only £0.8m (3%) lower
than last year. Telecoms continued its adverse trend due to lower customer numbers and lower average revenue
per customer. Data issues remain a concern. Government Services was £2.0m behind budget mainly due to POCA,
but also Passport Check & Send volumes.

Year to date total net income has worsened to £15.2m behind budget and £2.1m worse than this time last year
(excluding NSP)

Total expenditure (before project costs) in the month was £12.1m favourable to budget but includes £8.1m of VAT
recovery upside and this reflects the impact of the Post Office leaving the RM VAT group and the conclusion of
negotiations with HMRC.

Total expenditure (before project costs) year to date was £15.1m favourable to budget but includes £16.5m of VAT
recovery upside so the underlying variance remains adverse. The £16.5m VAT upside (£11m relates to the prior
year) was recognised in subpostmasters’ costs (£2.3m) and non staff costs (£14.2m).

Subpostmasters’ costs are favourable by £11.8m including £2.3m VAT recovered, further VAT and NI reductions
and the impact of lower sales volumes. Staff costs are adverse by £2.8m reflecting the savings tasks not being
achieved in Supply Chain and Commercial. Underlying Non staff costs, excluding the VAT upside, are adverse by
£8.2m driven by £2.9m of central savings task budget and the mails segregation penalty accrued £2.5m. Project
one off costs continue to overspend for Sparrow, the Journey to 2020 strategy work, and Business Transformation
(spend is subject to review of accounting treatment).

The Commercial Committee supported by the weekly Trading Meeting is focusing on actions to drive income. The
Business Transformation team is working with other business functions to identify and crystallise cost saving
opportunities as soon as possible.
Cashflow
The YTD cashflow was an outflow of £42m which is £32m favourable to the budget of £74m outflow.
The favourable variance is driven by lower than planned expenditure on NT and CT programmes.
Crown Profit
Crown profit is £2.8m adverse driven by lower Mails income and higher property costs.

Non Financials
The queue time metric is adverse, driven largely by Crowns, but is a significant improvement on the prior period.

Profit & Loss Statement
August 2014

Strictly Confidential

Operating profit (EBIT) of £9.2m was
£4,.5m favourable to budget.

BAU was £4.2m favourable:

+ Lower non staff costs of £9.8m, driven
by the VAT recovery in the period,

+ Lower Subpostmaster costs of £2.8m
due primarily to lower sales and product
mi

Offset by:

+ Lower net income of £8.0m due
primarily to lower Mails, POCA and
Telecoms income.

‘+ Higher staff costs of £0.5m in the
month. This is mainly due to the savings
task not being achieved

One-off Project Costs variance of £0.4m
favourable due to timing.

Below EBIT
The exceptionals favourable variance is
mainly driven by lower than budgeted
subpostmaster compensation.

Operating profit (EBIT) of £24.5m was £4.1m adverse to budget. (Excluding the £11m VAT upside relating to prior
year, this would be £15.1m adverse)

BAU was flat with budget:

+ Lower net income of £15.2m due primarily to the continuing adverse income trend: Mails (£12m), specifically labels
and Lottery, Telecoms (E4m), Government Services (E3m), mainly POCA, offset by favourable FS income (E2m),
specifically banking, Premium Bonds and MoneyGram.

+ Higher staff costs of £2.8m mainly due to the savings task not being achieved (€1.9m from Supply Chain and £0.5m
from Commercial) and the Crown pay deal.

Offset by:

+ Lower non staff costs of £6.0m, driven by the improved VAT recovery of £14.2m (£11m relates to the prior year)
The underlying variance exluding all of the VAT upside would be £8.2m adverse driven by the impact of the centrally
held savings task of £2.9m not being achived and £2.5m accrued for Mails Segregation Penalty payment,

+ Lower Subpostmaster costs of £11.8m due primarily to lower income and sales mix (7.9m), VAT recovery (£2.3m)
and other small variances including CTP budget opportunity.

One-off Project Costs variance of £4.0m adverse. This is mainly due to unbudgeted costs; £2.0m relates to
unbudgeted Business Transformation costs to date (FYF c. £7m - spend is subject to review of accounting
treatment), £1.4m relates to unbudgeted project Sparrow (FYF c. £7m) and £0.8m relates to unbudgeted strategy
consultancy costs.

Below EBIT
Both impairment and exceptionals are under budget due to underspends in NT, CT and IT& Change. Although lower
than budget, these are both twice last year's spend. The exceptionals budget also includes £8m ATOS contract set up

\ payment incurred in 203-14 but budgeted for 2014-15,Government grants have now been fully utilised

Operating profit (EBIT) of £24.5m was £13.4m adverse to prior

year.

Like for like BAU favourable variance of £0.9m was mainly due to

+ Lower Staff cost of £4.4m driven primarily by Crown savings.

+ Lower Subpostmaster costs of £0.5m driven by improved VAT
recovery.

Offset by:

+ Lower net income of £2.4m. The variance versus prior year is
driven primarily by lower Government Services income, mainly
POCA and Telecoms offset by higher Financial Services
(Moneygram, Mortgages, Savings and Insurance) revenue.

Higher non staff costs of £2.9m due to increased IT costs (mainly
Horizon and ATOS), marketing spend moving from POOC and
VAT on RM costs, offset by VAT recovery received this year.

Non like for like adverse variance of £14.3m was due to:

* Lower Network payment of £16.9m, offset by

* Lower project costs of £2.6m,

Below EBIT

Included in grant utilisation this year is £77m of 2013-14
‘exceptional spend for which there was insufficient grant last year.

(Summary
Income:

Income is £2.3m less than plan.

Variable sales income is £1.3m less than plan principally due to (i) Mails - Lower parcel volumes, Retail sales and Home Shopping returns, (ii) Financial Services - shortfall from Life Insurance, Home Insurance and
variable sales of Savings products. There is a corresponding upside in savings retention income due to the income guarantee with Bank of Ireland, Premium Bonds and Mortgages are performing above target
although the Premium Bonds upside impacts on Other Income due to the income cap with NS&l. This is offset by (iii) Government Services - predominantly due to higher Passport check & send transactions.
However, the variance in ‘Other Income’ that partially offsets this due to an element of the Passports target being held centrally

Fixed income is adverse due to lower than planned LIBOR rates for Card Account commissions

Retention income is adverse due to a lower customer base and Averaged Revenue Per User for HomePhone, partially offset by favourable Savings retention income.

Other income is adverse due to the delay or phasing of new products, predominantly Energy. Passport Check & Send and Premium Bonds (actual income in variable sales) is the other key driver.

Costs:

Costs are £0.5m higher than plan

Staff costs £0.1m favourable primarily due to vacancies, mainly Financial and Mortgage Specialist, partially offset by the impact of the pay review settlement where associated efficiencies will be achieved in future
months.

Other branch costs lower than plan due to losses being lower than expected although these are expected to reverse in the coming months.

Property costs £0.8m adverse due to the delayed savings for the new Facilities Management contract, now due to commence from October 2014.
Ne Central Costs are £0.2m favourable due to improved VAT recovery partially offset by business wide efficiency savings stil to be delivered. )

Cost Management update
August 2014

Progress since P4 update
Value and confidence

Following the introduction of a Cost Reduction Group (CRG) and an assesment of new
opportunities, the gap between the in-year delivery of "line of sight" initiatives and the total
cost reduction challenge has reduced to £21m (from Pé report of £26.9m),

Original Cost Management Programme £34.2m
Additional Cost Challenge to achieve budget £ 6.0m
Central Stretch to achieve budget £.5.9m
Total Budget Cost Challenge £46.1m
Additional Challenge from Q1 EBITDAS gap £ 7.0m
Total Current Cost Challenge £53.1m
Current "Line of Sight" forecast £32.1m
Gap to £53.1m £21.0m
Delivery and governance

Governance of FY14/15 cost reduction initiatives has now been brought into the overall
Business Transformation programme and work is underway with the various initiative
owners to address the shortfalls versus budget and identify new opportunities.

Regular 121 meetings have been established and "deep dive” meetings will be carried out
with each business function during September to drive out further in-year opportunities to
close the gap. These opportunities are added to a “Hopper” of high level ideas, which
currently stands at £10.1m of in-year value.

Strategic initiatives for FY15/16 and beyond

The overall Programme is now progressing through Stage 2, designing the target operating
model (TOM).

Work is ongoing to:

1) Identify a portfolio of incremental cost saving opportunities to achieve the £53-1m in-year
improvement target placing all the cost saving initiatives under the scrutiny of the
programme to ensure the expected improvement has the requisite effect on the 2014/15
EBITDAS outturn.

2) Design the target operating model that will ensure the cost efficiency targets forthe
programme (to 2019/20) are realised:

3) Craft design principles and develop business model scenarios in order to build a
compelling business case for the Business Transformation programme.

Metrics To Focus On
August 2014

/eoy metrics to focus on (YTD below target) include: >

‘Net Income: (Martin/ Kevin) (Bonus)

Net income is £15.2m adverse and is driven primarily by Mails, Telecoms and POCA income. The Mails variance was driven by labels, Collections & Returns, Special Delivery, Dangerous Good and lottery. This is partially offset by Financial Services being
favourable.

Operating Profit: (All) (Bonus)

Operating Profit is £4.41m adverse. This is however offset by £16.5m (£1:1m relates to prior year) of VAT recovery and so is greatly under stating the underlying position, which is driven by the savings task not being achieved, lower income and higher project

[Customer Metrics: 3 month rollingI1 month]
[CSAT top 3 box =a O
[CSAT top 2 box 1 3
Easy to do Business with (ETDBW score) 2 5
NPS 7 10

Customer Satisfaction: (Martin)

We continue to report on top 3 boxes, but it is important to learn from the top 2 and neutral scores.

‘As customer responses for satisfaction in the top 3 boxes (Extremely/very/fairly satisfied) have remained stable, the top 2 boxes (extremely/ very satisfied) have shown an improvement of 9pp this month. This shows that we are getting more people who are
extremely or very satisfied and fewer who are who are neither satisfied or dissatisfied.

Easy To Do Business With: (Martin) (Bonus)

3 month rolling - This measure has dropped a further 2pp in the 3 months to August to 25%. Looking into the Effort score, it's the Low Effort score (down by 1pp) that has caused the decline of the "3 month rolling’ Effort metric

1 month-The 3 month score masks an improvement in the monthly score of +5. Both High and Low Effort scores were ‘in the right direction in the month of August (as fewer people think we are high effort, and more people think we are low effort), An
improvement for three months will indicate a potential improvement overall. A single month may just be an exception,

Reason for 3 month rolling’ dip in Effort: Given the decline in the Effort score, a handful of drivers show a negative trend. We have seen small declines in drivers statements around customer service and product: Staff go the extra mile (-2pp); The time I have
to wait is always acceptable (-2pp); The products and services they offer meet my needs (-2pp); The website is easy to use (~4pp).

Reason for 3 month rolling decline in Effort: Crown vs. Agency branche; Crown branches have seen a dip in performance, with a new low of 8% Effort score reached. In particular, ths is driven by poor ‘go the extra mile’ scores (down 9ppl, which is likely to
align with recent staffing issues. Agency branches act as a counterweight to some extent, and overall '3 month rolling’ Effort scores have steadied at 35% (+p). However. within this, the ‘technology’ driver has seen a ip this time round, suggesting a
continuing need to innovate and keep up with the competitive store environment. Other drivers show early signs of halting the decline (e.g. some parts of Customer Service); in the month of August, this driver has pulled back from its July low.

Net Promoter Score: (Martin)

Looking at NPS, the '3 month rolling’ data is flat across the board, although the ‘1 month’ data shows improvements in both ends of the NPS scale compared to July numbers.

Queue time % < 5 minutes - Top 1k branches: (Kevin)

The percentage that queued under 5 mins showed a marked improvement in August, up 6pp to 828, and building on the marginal improvernent seen in July. The improvement overall driven by queue times in Crown (showing a +9pp movement) and to a
lesser extent Agency (+3pp). It appears that the greater shift to SSKs in Crowns may now be starting to show in wait times: something which will be monitored closely over the coming months.

We could hypothesise that during August, traffic was down in branch and so the in branch experience was better, both for Effort and for queues.

Branch Compliance - FS: (Nick)

This is made up of 14 weighted metrics: Mystery Shopping, Significant upheld complaints, Customer validation calls, Financial promotions, Limits on staff permissions, Staff product knowledge, Life Insurance cancellations, Savings cancellations, Crecit card
usage, Complaints process knowledge, Suitability of mortgage advice. The ones failing are Mystery Shopping (Red) and Life Insurance cancellations (Amber)

Branch Compliance - Mails: (Martin/ Kevin)
The targets shown are the full year exit rates. Inland (exit target 808) has decreased from 69% to 658, whilst International (exit target 85%) has decreased from 93% to 87%, which is still above target

Measured annually with some additional ‘Pulse surveys’
+ Engagement Index: (Neil) (Bonus) - The Engagement Index target is 1% greater than prior year outturn of 57%.
+ Subpostmaster Engagement Index: (Neil) - The Subpostmaster Engagement Index was last taken in December 2013 at 45%, The 48 target is the aspiration for the current year driven by the expected impact of the Branch Support Programme
+ Post Office values diversity: (Neil) ~ Survey from April shows 52% and the target is to get this to 66% criven by the business spotlight on diversity through various programmes such as the Diversity Forum, Women in Leadership and the introduction
of directorate level diversity objectives.
Appointments: (Neil)
48 appointments YTD (5 April, 7 May, 14 June, 15 July, 7 August), 21 female appointments YTD - 43.8% (2 April, 2 May, 7 June, 9 July 1 August), 5 BME appointments YTD - 10.4% (3 June, 1 July, 1 August).

Crown Profit: (Kevin) (Bonus)
The Crown loss is primarily driven by the lower Mails income and higher property costs.

Crown Profit Run Rate: (Kevin) (Bonus)
The Crown profit Run Rate is a key metric for year end and is updated quarterly. yy

At the point of conversion there is an initial decline in
performance; as the branches settle and embeds the
operational changes. However this improves month on
month and as they near the exit of the 6-12 month
category the run rate of performance is now higher
than the control group. This is partially as a result of
the activities that have been put in place to limit the
drop off in income and drive performance.

The 12-24 month category is still being impacted by
branches where there was a steeper decline at the
point of conversion.

Customer sessions/footfall continues to be strong so
this should support the agents retail growth.

Note: the control group is based on those branches of
similar size that have not yet converted less 5% to
reflect lost products,

on more complicated products,

Agent

+ Customer sessions indicate that retailers are benefiting from greater footfall that should support their retail growth

Fixed pay has been reduced to zero for all converted branches, in line with the strategic plan.
On average Lottery income has reduced by c. £60k p.a in these branches. Corrective action on how we minmise future risk is now being looked at, principally by improving the sales messages and focus of
the FCA's when signing up the retailer as well as the LRM's focussing on these messages for those already converted

Products such as bill payments, etop ups, cash withdrawals and moneygram have delivered growth for these branches - with associated footfall. This has been offset in income terms by poorer performance

+ The footfall is delivering quicker but lower value Post Office sales which in turn should allow the retailer to utilise their staff in different ways or reduce their staff costs.

Customer

+ Customer Satisfaction, extended opening hours and queue times all remain positive

Contracts signed, openings and current quality measures ahead of target, though model profitability KPI to be agreed via revised business
case which is now due for completion in September. Guided Leavers pilot underway with no significant negative stakeholder reaction, with
continued roll out of next stages agreed at programme Steering Group. Key action for the programme is to define clearly, discuss and
agree the ‘cliff, aligning to business strategies being presented to Board in September.

The programme continues to deliver in line with targets across branch transformations, training, staff cost reductions, SSK rollout, mergers
and relocations - though P&L run rate £1M adverse at end of Q1 (due to income and business wide cost savings behind plan). Therefore
an over achievement in last 3 quarters is required to achieve target. More focused income call to action required at Trading Board to
address Crown income shortfall. Customer satisfaction (queue times and transformed branches) both behind target but at P5 variance
from target improving. 16 of the 70 Franchise branches are at risk with the programme investigating options for alternative ways to
franchise or find further savings to cover the shortfall

Programme to produce a series of options, for October Transformation Committee, to achieve Crown break even run rate by March 2015
(including close alignment with Network Development).

Programme continuing, rather than pause or integrate into Business Transformation to allow early savings to be realised and improve
efficiency of existing operation. This will create a more stable platform for any Target Operating Model (TOM) changes to be made. The
programme is investigating accelerating activity to bring forward benefits from 2015-16 into this year (potential additional £500K benefits)
Specific questions within Agent engagement index are proposed to measure Quality of the programme output

Core Finance System implementation and cut over successfully achieved to plan.

Extension side letter due to be agreed at the next MSA Board on the 24" Sept and includes incentives to separation dates for the
remaining IT workstreams. The CSC contract supporting the separation of HR and Supply Chain (hosting and service elements) due to be
signed in late September.

Alignment between IT Transformation and Business Transformation programmes continues
Revised business case produced but not yet submitted to Finance Committee, benefits and 2014-15 cost profile remain on track, though
there isa risk to the programme costs beyond 2014/15

Network Development has significant dependencies on Common Digital Platform and Branch Counter Refresh with appropriate ATOS and
Accenture resource working within the Network Development programme. As a result of pausing the POL SAP upgrade a risk has risen
regarding Fujitsu's willingness to continue supporting POL SAP on the existing infrastructure until March 2016 — discussions have started
with Fujitsu. Transformation Committee agreed alternative governance reporting for IT Enablers portfolio

TOM recommendations discussed at ExCo in preparation for Post Office Board meeting on 25 September. A review of the impact of the
TOM on existing programmes to be undertaken prior to Board meeting. Programme co-ordinating all cost reduction activities (both
operational efficiency and existing cost reduction actions) and reporting to ExCo on weekly basis. An assessment of 2014/15 change plan
has been completed with recommendations being implemented (e.g. pausing certain projects and aligning others)

Benefits red as route to achieving savings not yet agreed.

Programme fully operational with focus on recommendations for September Post Office Board, a compelling commercial proposition to
inform the full programme business case and lvy pilots (that are under development). A major risk for the programme is being able to
develop a commercially viable business case

Dependencies exist with Business Transformation for 2020 product lists and CDP to enable separation from legacy technology. Future
Network design underway and will need to consider impacts on other programmes particularly Network Transformation

Headcount of 7,413 is 101 adverse to budget.
The adverse variance is driven by Crowns as the headcount budget reflects the savings

Higher staff costs of £2,8m mainly due to the savings task not being achieved (€1.9m from
Supply Chain and £0.5m from Commercial) and the Crown pay deal

The staff costs are £4,4m favourable to prior year driven by lower Crown costs, IT Outsourcing

Financial Services YTD non people costs were £6,0m favourable to budget and 3%

£2.9m adverse to prior year.

Vs.
Lower non staff costs of £6.0m driven primarily by the improved
VAT recovery of £14.2m (€11m relates to the prior year). The
underlying position (excluding the VATupside] would be £8,2m
adverse, driven by the impact of the centrally held savings task of
£2,9m not being achived, £2.5m accrued for Mails Segregation

Penalty payment in Compensation and other increased costs
including postage.

Vs. Prior Year
Higher non staff costs of £2.9m due primarily to increased
Property costs post separation (VAT on RM costs) and IT costs
(mainly Horizon and ATOS). The marketing fees have also been
moved fram POOC to non staff this year with a FY impact of
£9m, The overall increase is almost completely offset by the
increased VAT recovery rate benefit this year of £14,2m (of

POST OFFICE LIMITED MATTERS — DISPUTE RESOLUTION
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — CLAIMS OVER £500K OR THOSE OF A SENSITIVE NATURE

PART (A) - CIVIL LITIGATION

Horizon claims POL/RW Belinda
(aka “Project Angela
Sparrow’) Bogerd

Crowe
van

/
den

POL has received various claims from
subpostmasters (SPMs) alleging defects in the
Horizon system and POL’s internal processes.

These allegations were initially made in 5
claims brought through solicitors Shoosmiths.
Similar allegations have been made by the
“Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance” (JFSA)
and advanced through SPMs’ MPs.

Following discussions with James Arbuthnot
MP and JFSA, independent investigator Second
Sight Support Services Ltd (Second Sight) was
appointed in July 2012 to carry out a review
into these allegations.

On 08.07.13, Second Sight published a Report
finding shortcomings in POL’s internal training
and support to SPMs on the Horizon system,
but no systemic problems with Horizon itself.

Following the Second Sight Report, on
27.08.13 POL launched a Mediation Scheme
(Scheme) aimed at resolving _ individual
complaints made about Horizon.

This matter will be the subject of a separate
update to ExCo.

The Scheme received 150 applications,
which are being progressed under the
direction of a Working Group comprising
retired Court of Appeal Judge Sir Anthony
Hooper (as Chair), POL, Second Sight, and
JFSA.

Mediations have now been held for the first
three applications. The POL project team
continue to handle the applications in line
with the Board's direction to take a firmer
position, informed by its legal position and
tighter control over timescales and costs.

To date, no claim has been made against
POL in the civil courts, and no appeal has
been made against any conviction in the
criminal courts, following Second Sight's
Report.

PROSECUTION CASES

There are number of cases which could have been prosecuted (e.g. those with full and frank admissions to theft /fraud), but prosecutions were not
commenced to avoid adverse judicial comment.

Several cases have also been terminated while POL obtains an independent expert report on the Horizon branch accounting system (see below).

There are currently 14 cases which are being kept under review as to whether a prosecution (supported by an expert report) can be commenced.

EXPERT REPORT

New experts from Imperial College London have prepared a scope of work on which formal instructions and a protocol for requesting and receiving
information will be based

Appropriate individual confidentiality agreements will be prepared for both for the experts and POL employees involved in preparing the report.

It is envisaged that meeting/s to progress the report will take place with the experts, POL and Fujitsu in September and October 2014.

PROSECUTION POLICY

Former First Senior Treasury Counsel Brian Altman QC has drafted a proposed prosecution policy for POL.
Comments from POL stakeholders will now be sent to Brian Altman for review.

POST OFFICE LTD EXECUTIVE MEETING
Delegating authority for software licence purchases — September 2014
1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

11 Prior to submission to the Board, present to the EXCO for noting a request for the
delegation of its authority to approve software licence purchases and associated
support contracts containing uncapped liability to a group consisting of the CFO
(Chris Day), General Counsel (Chris Aujard) and ClO (Lesley Sewell).

1.2 Software licence agreements and associated support contracts will be signed by an
authorised signatory under the ‘Post Office Procurement Delegated Authorities’ once
the contract has been approved by the CFO, CIO and General Counsel.

2. Background

2.1 The Board has delegated their authority to enter contractual commitments on its
behalf. This process is managed via the contract approval procedures and the
Contract Approval Form (“CAF”).

2.2 Any contracts with unlimited liabilities for Post Office must be approved by the Post
Office Limited Board.

2.3 It is standard industry practice for software agreements for “off the shelf’ proprietary
products from large software vendors, such as Microsoft and SAP, to contain
uncapped liability clauses. Negotiation options with these suppliers are limited.

24 Requesting Board approval for each licence agreement with an uncapped liability will
burden the Board and add limited value, as these are market standard positions. This
will also add time to the process of getting the relevant licences in place.

2.5 Delays in seeking Board approval may result in cost increases if negotiated discounts
are time boxed by vendors.

26 In separating the software licence estate from Royal Mail Group, there is a large
number of “off the shelf’ software licences that will need to be signed in the name of
Post Office Limited. There are 62 known software vendors whose products are in use
and new licence agreements will need to be signed.

2.7 This recommendation will result in software licence agreements being added to the
current list! of market standard, uncapped liabilities that have been delegated for
approval, as documented in the guideline document that accompanies the CAF.

3. Activities/Current Situation

3.1 Negotiations are currently underway and nearing completion with the large vendors
such as Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Adobe. Each of their contracts contains, or will
contain either an uncapped liability clause or the contract will be silent as to any cap
on Post Office's liability.

? Category B Contractual Liabilities as documented in the Delegated Authority Guidelines.
POL00306425
POL00306425

Confidential
Proposal
41 All agreed licence terms and associated support contracts with software vendors are:
e reviewed by internal and/or external legal counsel
e approved by Post Office Limited ClO, CFO and General Legal Counsel through
the signing of a CAF (including countersignature by Company Secretariat)

e signed by an authorised signatory within Post Office Procurement

4.2 Copies of the agreement(s) and CAF will be kept by Company Secretariat and a
summary of the contract(s) signed through this route are sent to Board for noting.

Commercial Impact/Costs

5.1 There is limited commercial impact in delegation of authority. In many instances Post
Office are already using these products through Royal Mail agreements.

Key Risks/Mitigation

6.1 The key risk is that the delegated EXCO members approve an uncapped liability
position that the Board would view as an unacceptable risk. This is mitigated through
the need to secure the approval of three nominated EXCO members.

Long term considerations

7 Software Asset Management will be implemented and managed via Atos as part of
the transition to the IT Towers. This will allow Post Office to optimise the use of these
assets and minimise risk of future liabilities arising from unlicensed software.

Communications Impact

8.1 There are no communication impacts beyond the IT procurement team who are
already aware of this proposal.

Conclusion

9.1 Delegated authority to approve software licence agreements containing uncapped
liability will not introduce any new material risks to Post Office Limited.

Recommendations
The EXCO is asked to note that:
10.1 A request to delegate authority to approve software licence agreements containing

uncapped liabilities to the ClO, CFO and General Legal Counsel will be presented to
the Board for approval.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Authentication of the Post Office Limited Company Seal
1. Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to seek the Board’s approval to revise the persons with
delegated authority to authenticate the fixing of the Company's seal.

2. Current Situation

2.1 The principal purpose the company seal is used for is to execute documents
as deeds (most commonly property documents). The Board receives and
confirms the list of documents executed by the company seal at each Board
meeting.

2.2 On 31 October 2013 the Board approved that the affixing of the company seal
may be authenticated by any one of the following: a current Director of the
Company; the Company Secretary; the Assistant Company Secretary; the
General Counsel; and Piero D’Agostino.

3. Proposal

In light of changes to the Business and to meet the Business’ needs going forward, it
is requested that the Assistant Company Secretary is removed from the list of
persons authorised to authenticate the company seal and that the Deputy Company
Secretary is added.

4. Recommendations

The Board is asked to approve that the affixing of the company seal may be
authenticated by any one of the following: a current Director of the Company; the
Company Secretary; the Deputy Company Secretary; the General Counsel; and
Piero D’Agostino.
