As discussed; I have recently been asked by both the PSNI and the Public Prosecution Service
(PPS) to comment on the POL Horizon system as the integrity of the system has been raised
by the alleged offender in the Drumantee case as she is being prosecuted by the Police. The
now retired SPMR of Drumantee is also now querying the system and he was required to stand
the loss in this theft case.

My response to the PSNI IO in the Drumantee case was as follows (21/3/17) = ‘Regarding our
recent discussion and in terms of the integrity of the Post Office Horizon system, I can again
confirm that Post Office Ltd are absolutely confident in the integrity of the Horizon system and
if any person has any specific issues or complaints about the system then that/those matters
should be raised so that they can be addressed in an appropriate manor’.

I am now to be summoned to attend Crown Court as a POL witness (expert) in the Strangford
case and I can imagine that the Horizon issue will be raised by the defence barrister,
subsequently can I ask that the matter is raised in order to allow myself, and others placed in
a similar position, to have a business legal response.

Below is a recent e mail trail concerning the matter!

I’ve just left you a voicemail. Can you please give me a call back when you get a moment - 07436546824.

Thanks, Rodric

Hi Shirley,

Not sure if you’re aware of this case in N.Ireland (see Simons email below)?

It appears the PPS are after us providing a report re the Horizon ‘glitches’. I seem to recall that Fujitsu have provide
something like this in the past (I think), refuting such allegations; I just wondered if we had a standard response
document that we could provide in instances like this?

Many thanks

Wayne

As discussed — Drumantee Police liaison case — POLTD/1415/0102, the Police investigating officer has made the
following enquiry:

It has taken the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) a year to make a direction on this case! Iam now ina position to
inform you that the trial of Patricia FEGAN is set and in their usual fashion the PPS have today requested a list of
queries to be answered ASAP.

The last time I spoke to you, you were not able to supply us with a report re the glitches in the ‘Horizon system’. Are
you ina position now to supply any kind of report re this? Lastly what are the Post Office’s view on this
investigation? The PPS are confused why Damien McGenity (SPMR) had to and did pay the shortfall if this was
reported as a theft by his staff.

Patricia FEGAN appeared in court yesterday (24/1/17) and plead not guilty with her defence barrister discussing the
reported difficulties with the Post Offices Horizon system!

Regards

Simon
