  .1 Scope
This High Level Design sets out the design for the Secure Access Servers described in the Remote
Support and Diagnostics architecture (ARC/SYSIARC/0004).        This will provide remote support
access to IRE1I and IRE19 for the following user communities:
   â¢    SSC
   â¢    SMG
   â¢    ISD (Unix, NT and Network support)
   â¢    Test

The design will cover the connection method from workstations to the SAS (SSNv2), the applications
and clients installed on the SAS (SSNv2) and the secure method used to connect to supported
platforms.

The support workstations and laptops used to connect to the SAS (SSNv2) are out of scope for this
design.

Third Party support access is not covered in this HLD.        See DES/SYM/HLD/0019 - Third Party
Support Access High Level Design.




This design is contained within the Remote Support and Diagnostics Architecture. The context of the
SAS (SSNv2) is described in ARC/SYS/ARC/0004. The diagram below shows where the SSNv2 fits
into the overall support architecture. The SSNV2v1 will be retained to support legacy HNGIx
platforms.

The high level requirements for the Secure Access Servers are to provide support teams with:
 â¢ Controlled and audited access to the operational platforms
 â¢ Multiple sessions for support users
 â¢ OpenSSH access from the SSNV2 to the managed operational platforms.
 â¢ Secure web based access to campus servers. All access to SSNv2 server will be on HTTPS
   (443) port. From SSNv2 onward to campus servers can be either on HTTPS or HTTP.
 â¢ Access to the System Management.


 These requirements are from the Remote Support and Diagnostics topic architecture -
 ARC/SYS/ARC0004.


 The aim of the Remote Support Secure Access Server HLD is to meet the requirements listed in
 Table I - SAS (SSNV2) System Requirements, in the Requirements Traceability Section of this
 document.

4.1 Secure Access Server Overview

The SSNv2 is based on the Microsoft Windows 2012 platform as described in DES/PPS/HLD2743 -
Windows Server 2012 High Level Design for HNG-X. They will be used in scale out configuration as
shown in diagram below.




                                       SAS Server 1
                                        Connection
                                          Broker




                    ILL Session Hosts


In this design the users are grouped and connect into the first SSNv2 which acts as a Connection
Broker. The broker acts as a software load balancer, and assigns both a User Profile Drive and a
Session Host for the user to connect to.




The SAS (SSNv2) servers will be placed into a Remote Desktop Services deployment collection, and
users will connect to the primary SAS (SSNv2) using the RDP client over SSL. The RDS deployment
will enable multiple users to be connected to any of the SAS (SSNv2) collection. Users will be
authenticated using Active Directory and the strong authentication method described in
DES/PPS/HLD/0003 - HNG-X Active Directory High Level Design and DES/SEC/HLD/0001 - HNG-X
Strong Authentication High Level Design, respectively. Appropriate support roles will be configured
using AD groups and policies (ref. DES/SEC/HLD/0001, DESSECHLD0004.DOC).
The two factor authentication system is provided by Safenet iKey software and USB dongle. The
USB dongle will either be the iKey 4000 or the eTokens 5110 (TBC after compatibility testing)


System Requirement - T-RSD-3 (role based access)
System Requirement - T-RSD-9 (2 factor authentication should be used)

A Secure Shell (ssh) client will be installed on the SAS (SSNV2) and ssh server will be installed on
the operational platforms. This will provide a secure shell for support access.
Support workstations will access the SAS (SSNv2) collection over the Fujitsu Corporate Network
using RDP.
A single SSNv2 server will be allocated as an 'exception' server, which will permit access to users
who are unable to connect using their iKey. This server will be placed into its own collection inside of
the Remote Desktop Services deployment, and will only permit access from users placed into the
exception group in Active Directory, which is currently ikey-exemptou-users. Users attempting to
access the exception SSNv2 will need to do so using its direct IF address, to ensure the connection
broker does not attempt to push them onto an ikey-enabled SSNv2.
For the production environment, the SSNv2 Exception Server will be LPRPSSNV2203


4.1.2          Au it
Although no active command logging or keystroke logging is done, we are keeping the record of
people logged on to SAS (SSNV2) server through double authentication and OS security policies for
state servers. Security policy is implemented to raise alert when any file is copied or deleted to SAS
(SSNV2) server. Also no user account is allowed to install any software on SAS (SSNv2). FTP folder
will be maintained manually by SSC team.
All components of the SAS (SSNv2) should comply with the manageability requirements.
System Requirement - T-RSD-29, T-RSD-30, T-RSD-34 (Applications should provide diagnostic or
log files â see manageability compliance guidelines.




From the SAS (SSNv2) support users will be able to run the following support tools:
â¢    Tivoli tasks
â¢    Cygwin tools
â¢    Installed software clients
â¢    Web based clients
â¢    Windows 2012 support tools
â¢    RDP




Remote Desktop Services (RDS) is the modern version of Microsoft Terminal Services, and there are
a few differences to the way RDS is configured.
An RDS system is known as a deployment, in this case a session-based desktop deployment will be
used.
An RDS Deployment utilises the following server roles.
    â¢    Remote Desktop Connection Broker (RDCB). The connection broker role will be installed on
         the first SAS (SSNv2) and acts as the main connection point for clients. It then routes clients
         through to an available Session Host server (described below) and thus acts as a software
         load balancer.

         Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH). The Remote Desktop Session Host role is the
         component that allows multiple users to log onto a server simultaneously (Windows Server
         nominally only otherwise allows two connections at most) and use applications on that server.
         The RDSH role will be installed on all the SAS (SSNV2's).
         Remote Desktop Licensing: This role is applied to a server in the deployment to provide
         licensing services. Each client accessing RDS requires a license. Per Device' licensing will
         be used.
    â¢    Remote Desktop Web Access: This role is installed as part of a deployment, but will not be
         utilised for the SAS (SSNV2) configuration.
Once the deployment is configured, a 'collection' is created under which the RDSH servers are
assigned. A collection can provide access to RemoteApp software, but this will functionality will not
be used, and instead the collection will purely be used to assign available RDSH servers for client
connectivity and apply required configuration, for example User Profile Drives.


                             â¢
Remote Desktop Services in Windows 2012 gives the ability to use VHD virtual hard disk files as
User Profile disks. These are accessible using UNC access to a Windows 2012 hosted file share.
When a user logs into the SSNv2, a template VHD file is copied to a new file which matches the
user's SID. This is then mapped transparently to the user, with the contents of their profile directory
appearing as normal in Explorer, but being fully contained with the VHD file.
This enables full roaming profiles for a user, so no matter which SSNv2 they log in to, their profile is
always accessible and kept in a central location. This also permits a more straightforward way of
backing up user profiles, as only a single VHD file for each user will need to be backed up.
One disadvantage of using UPDs is that two RDS collections cannot use the same location for user
profile files, so anyone connecting into the SSNv2 ikey Exception Server will not be able to access
their normal roaming profile.
The user profile disks will be stored in a network share hosted by the SSCv2 server, Iprpssc201.
For regular users, the share name will be NAS_SSNv2_USERS$, and for exception users, the share
name will be NAS SSNv2 IKEYEXCEPTIONS$

To establish an SSH session an SSH client is required on the SAS (SSNV2) and the SSH server
service or daemon on the target system. The PuTTY OpenSSH client (PUTTY v0.66 ) will be used to
connect from the SAS (SSNV2) to the ssh server. PUTTY also includes the command line tool PSCP
which can be used to securely copy files between client and server.
This is detailed in the HLD for OpenSSH/sudosh connectivity.
System Requirement - T-RSD-1




The COTS selected to provide SFTP to SSC is JScape. It will be installed on SSC server. For end to
end file transfers all files will be transferred to SSC server and from there they will be pulled either to
SSC workstation or to SAS (SSNV2) using PSCP client.
JSCAPE software is installed on SSC server, from SSC workstation files will be transferred to SSC
server. Then user logged on to campus server via RDP I SSH session from SAS (SSNV2) will
download files to campus server from SSC server. Similarly files will be pushed to SSC server from
campus server and then using WSFTP client they will be downloaded to SSC workstation.


4.3.4          Web Clients
Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 and Mozilla Firefox will provide connection for web based clients. This
access will not be audited on the SAS (SSNV2) and access should be restricted, secure and
auditable on the target server. Web clients should use https and certificates will be provided by the
Certificate Authority described in DES/SEC/HLD/0003 - HNG-X KEY MANAGEMENT HIGH LEVEL

Java SE Runtime Environment and the Java Development Kit have been updated to the latest
supported version from Horizon. These provide a complete environment in which to run and develop
Java applications. At this time, the version installed will be Java 8 64 bit.
Should any other version of Java be required for applications, it MUST be installed into its own
custom directory, and programs relying on this other version must support being able to redirect to it,
rather than the system default of Java 8.

The BigFix console is the User Interface for the Big Fix application m etalled on the TEMv2 platform.
XWindow client
A client to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for networked computers connecting to XServer
application running on the server machine, through SSNV2 connection. The client will be installed on
the SSNV2 servers and made available to remote human users when needed. Several XWindow
client are available, on a free license basis, including Cygwin-X.

7-Zip is a multi-format archiver and unarchiver, compatible with all major formats of compression,
including ZIP, RAR, BZIP and many more. It is freeware and has both GUI and command line
interfaces.




Notepad++ is a freeware text-editor, with support for different file encodings (e.g. ANSI, UTF8) and
different line-endings (e.g. Windows, Unix/Mac). It also provides regex search/replace functions,
macros, and has a plugin system to allow for further customisation or ability.




The version of Office 2013 to be installed on the SSNv2's should correspond to the version on
corporate laptops. At the time of writing, this is Office Professional Plus 2013. Using the same
version on both the server and support laptop ensures no extra licensing is required, although an
initial license is needed to allow the software to be installed on the SSNv2 and activated.

8.1 Security
The security of the SAS (SSNV2) and the supported platforms it is used to access will be ensured by
the features described in the following sub sections.




Support users roles will be defined in AD and in the Tivoli Management Framework. This will ensure
that only selected users will have permission to carry out potentially hazardous tasks on target
platforms. Tasks identified by SSC as repeatable and low risk will be passed to 2 ' line support after
development and testing.




Refer to the OpenSSH, Cygwin, Sudosh high level design â document reference'to be added.




See high level design for Strong Authentication - DES/SEC/HLD/0001. This provides Windows 2003
natively supported 2 factor authentication using USB tokens.


               'A'il i[.1JAISJ
The Windows 2012 platform poa_bastian.xml security policy is applied. This is part of the platform
foundation build and supplied in the windows distribution. Security patches relevant at the date of
first build will be applied to the platform and these will be documented. All other patching will be
subject to the patching and upgrade policies and processes.
RDP traffic from the remote support workstations and laptops to the SAS (SSNV2) will be encrypted
using 128 bit SSL. See DES/SEC/HLD/0003 - HNG-X KEY MANAGEMENT HIGH LEVEL DESIGN
for details of the Certificate server that would be required for this.




The platform will provide resilience and repair described in the Windows 2003 platform design. For
the blade hosted SAS (SSNV2) in IRE11 and IRE19.
For HNG-X it is planned to have 3 SAS (SSNV2) in each Data Centre.

See the Windows 2003 Platform design for details of how this platform meets performance
requirements. In summary the base build has improved performance by increased page file size on
a dedicated disk and optimised disk partition configuration.
To ensure adequate terminal server performance all third party products should be supported under
the terminal server environment. Where suppliers do not specifically state support under terminal
services, these products should be adequately tested to ensure they do not adversely affect the
performance of the server.


                  s
The service has been designed on Microsoft Terminal Server. Although this provides a GUI for
interactive use, the system will not be used interactively except for SAS (SSNV2) platform set up and
maintenance. Users from SSC, SMG and ISD, will log on through the Terminal Server Client on the
local Support Workstation, and be given access through ssh, client software and through the
Terminal Server profile to the target system, applications or files.




  .5 Potential for Change
The focus of ssh session logging may be moved from the client to the ssh server service removing
the need for the command logger on the SAS (SSNV2). Sudosh may be used to log ssh session
content to the syslog file which would then be picked up by the audit solution.


Additional support tools and clients may be installed on the SAS (SSNV2) in future. These clients
must ensure that they have adequate, secure auditing or that application auditing takes place at the
application server.


Additional SAS (SSNV2) can be added if additional support users or support groups require access to
the HNG-X infrastructure.

The following risks and assumptions have been identified with the SAS (SSNV2) design for HNG-X:
Risks:
 â¢ Delays due to licences for RD CALs will limit access.
Assumptions:
 â¢ Assumed that there will be a level of auditing on supported DC servers accessed using specific
   clients.
 â¢ Assumed that development will take place with the installed version of cygwin. If a later version
   is released prior to development the version of cygwin used for INF-2 will be replaced.
 â¢ Support skills are available to support the open source code that is compiled and release as part
   of this design.
