Amber Alert

The milestone spreadsheet has been updated and now incorporates a column with the dates if contingency is added on
the tasks that are believed to require it, and includes a 4 week client change freeze.

Reviews have been held with Peter Rowley, Core etc.

Peter Rowley has met with the client and explained that more time is required to finalise the plan and the DA Report

A set of milestones are being drafted for the client that must be achieved - this is to be reviewed with the client on a
weekly basis and will also form part of the alert report.

Work is being undertaken to finalise the plan and completion is targeted for next week. The updated risk log and financials
will then be finalised.

All interviews are complete for the DA Review.

Draft End to End plan created and being reviewed to ensure it is deliverable.

LST is now complete and in testing.

2 PM’s are being interviewed today (28/04).

This evening (28/04), there is a risk workshop being facilitated by an FJ expert in this field.

For the plan we are also seeking advice and guidance from an expert within P&PM.

It is anticipated that by Wednesday cob (29/04), we will have a detailed plan that shows the critical path end to
end and a set of true level 1 milestones that need to be monitored.

There is an action from the client programme board regarding approach to RV Migration testing and it is hoped
that a final decision will be made on this at the meeting on Thursday (30/04). The decision will then be
incorporated in the plan Friday (01/05).

Once the plan is at this state, we will be able to finalise the Cost at Complete and will be ready for DA to
finalise their review and report.

Graham Murray has spoken to Clive Bailey and advised that the review with Peter Rowley should be moved
back a week to enable us to have a robust plan and CTC that have been’ produced by the programme and been
reviewed by DA.
