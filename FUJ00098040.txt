Preface

This history has been written without access fo notes and records and
is therefore very much dependant on the memory of a single individual.
That single individual worked for POL so it is Inevitable that It is written
from that perspective. It does not attempt to go into great detail ~ a full
account of the HNG X Project probably deserves something on the
scale of War and Peace.

The document takes the reader up fo the point In May 2008 when new
management and resources were injected into HNG X and just as Alan
D’Alvarez was faking over as Programme Director
