Subject: Wincor ATM Log Fault - Shoosmiths

Hugh, excellent meeting today and some interesting points raised.

As per our conversation I have been advised that a contract termination issue has been passed, by former SPMR, to
Shoosmiths in regards to alleged Horizon issues and an erroneous entry on an ATM log (not a Horizon log). Details as
follows:

Brampton SPSO Barnsley (509340)

Contract termination due to an aged debt of £20K — former SPMR claims ATM / Horizon was at fault for the loss
inasmuch as a transferred to ATM figure doubled up (matter dealt with by conduct and not prosecution).

Former SPMR Susan Watson has produced (and sent Shoosmiths the same) a number of documents including a
Wincor ATM log for branch dated April 2011 showing that the number of individual rejected notes on a particular day
as 4294966779 (four thousand million notes). The log is clearly incorrect.

Whilst in summary the former SPMR was not operating the ATM reconciliation correctly, she is alleging that the
Horizon system and ATM machine generated the loss and that she has been the innocent victim in this matter.

Rod Ismay is aware and I have asked Dave Hulbert to drive a technical response from Wincor around the issue; no
correspondence has been received that I know of from Shoosmiths in relation to this matter.

Susan, to note please and particularly should the matters escalate.
