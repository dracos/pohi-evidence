ARQ Service (Audit System)

Contracted to supply historical extracts of data,
used in legal proceedings

The completeness of data was underwritten by
our witness statement

Counter problem — PEAK PC0152376 — “The
fact that EPOSS code is not resilient to errors is
endemic”

We are manually cross checking with available
event data but completeness is still not
guaranteed

Manual & Proposed Process

Manual process is onerous and must be reviewed —
It is error prone and time consuming

It involves moving large volumes of data between the
Audit server and workstation

It requires local and insecure storage of event audit
data, invalidating certain statements made within the
current witness statement

It has no DR mechanism in the event of DR from BRAO1
to LEWO02

Proposed CP to partially automate in a secure manner
