0611290794

New call taken by Stephanie Byrne: Closure @ 1600 today due to an Audit.
Closed until further notice

Resolution:

This call is still open

Outcome

This call was raised to highlight the fact that the Office will be closed until
further notice.

The calls E- 0605120970, E- 0601050008, referrer to a “critical event’ “Critical
NT_Error’. The term critical is the comparative level of attention required to
generate remedial action. It refers to the level of attention required on a grading
system for example critical high level of attention or warning would be medium level
of attention. These critical events occurred outside the Post Office opening times
and a standard action of a reboot of the systems, which would also highlight any
further issues, was undertaken and repaired the problem and confirmed stability of
the system. I should add that this area is not my particular area of expertise. I have
a general knowledge of these procedures and have made the comments above to
aid the court.
