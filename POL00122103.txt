Current NI arrangement is ad hoc with PSNI.

PSNI have to scan and type our case work onto their electronic system as a favor to us and then forward to PPS who
prosecute.

We are in negotiations with firm of NI solicitors and jarnail to do same as rest of UK.

We currently have difficulty getting PSNI to do for us and I anticipate service will be withdrawn in the short term.
Ring if u need anything else

Dear Andy and et al.

As Post Office Ltd has separated form Royal Mail Group, there is a new to review the Prosecution Policy for the
business to ensure it is fit for purpose for our particular organisation and then endorsed by ExCo and the POL Board.

Please find attached a number of documents as detailed by Jarnail’s email below. We've had an initial meeting on
Monday and some amendments will be made in terms of the policy and stance to be taken. However there is now a
very short review period and I will be reporting back before going on leave this Friday.

Please review the policies and feedback any comments as a collective by email by Thursday so that I can collate and
respond.

Happy to discuss individually or collectively on a conference call, if so please give me a ring or arrange.
Not to be circulated wider please.

Cheers.

John.
