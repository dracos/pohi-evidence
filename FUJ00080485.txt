4 _ End to End Incident Management

All incidents reported to the HSD are managed in accordance with the “POA Incident Management
Process” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018). Calls are logged in the incident management system

4.1 Incident Logging
4.1.1 Receiving & Diagnosing a Call

HSD Agents will always ensure that they are always ready and able to take a service call, unless they
are doing call related work, when they must set their telephone to Desk Work or away from their desk on
a break, when they must set their telephone to Desk Work. The Agent should also ensure that their
headset is on their head ready for use BEFORE the call is answered to ensure there is no delay or
background noise before greeting the caller & that the call management system is up and running.

This will minimise the delay to a caller when the Agent is retrieving/recording the caller's details and thus
allow more time for the Agent to speak to the caller regarding the problem.

The moment an Agent receives an incoming telephone call, they will greet the customer with the
example shown below. All spoken words are marked in Italics and in “quotes”.

“Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, Horizon Service desk, [AGENT NAME] speaking”.
“May I take your Branch code please?”
Branch Code Validation Failure

lf a Branch code cannot be given, the caller immediately fails validation. If the reason why the Branch
code cannot be provided is because the PO employee cannot remember, or does not know the Branch
code, the incident will be logged under ‘999999’ as Other Queries, QU04 Caller fails initial verification,
Cause: Resolution Administration, taking all the details of the caller. The Agent must then politely decline
the call directing the caller to the NBSC for example:

“Unfortunately without a branch code we are unable to assist further. Please call back
once you know your branch code”

If the caller is not entitled to service from the HSD but was given the HSD number to use in terms of PO-
related business i.e., “my pension book has not arrived at the Post Office and the PM said to call you to
ask you for further information about it", the Agent must take down the details of the caller, name and
number and details about who provided them with the HSD telephone number. Service to the caller must
then be politely declined for example:

“Unfortunately I cannot recall any information on our system regarding your details which
means I am unable to help you further”

Branch Code Validated

(a) For each call where the Branch code is provided, the Agent must verify the caller with the
information retrieved from the Triole for Service system. The Agent should confirm the
following with the caller:

e Site name (e.g. Post Office name)
e Telephone number
e Caller’s full name (recording it in the logged call)

¢ Position of the caller

CONFIDENCE)

NB: If the telephone number is different from the number listed in Triole for Service, the
Agent MUST ask the caller to confirm that the number is the MAIN telephone number for
the Post Office.

(b) If any of the above details given differ from that displayed in Triole for Service, ask the
caller to confirm the:

« Post code
¢ Postal address

Details of any changes should be escalated to IMT and the PM should be advised to
inform the NBSC of the change.

c) If the caller cannot be verified from this information then the AGENT should log the call as
Other Queries, QU04 Caller fails initial verification, Cause: resolution Administration on the
Problem Management System.

The AGENT will then end the call politely, an example of which is shown below.

“Unfortunately I cannot recall any information on our system regarding your details so I am unable to help
you further. You may wish to contact the NBSC for assistance by dialling 0845 6011022

Taking Information about the Issue

The Agent must establish the reason for the call from the customer; an example of how to obtain this
information might be to ask:

“Which part of the Horizon equipment may I help you with?”

Whilst noting the issue , the Agent must check the incident history in the profile browser window to
make sure that there isn’t an incident already open for the caller's current problem. If there is already an
open incident, the Agent must open this call to add an update.

A minimum evidence requirement is required for incidents that require further investigation by another
SDU ie SSC

12. Barcode references for any issues concerning transactions that make use of barcodes

Balancing issues

As a business issue these should be initially sent to the NBSC. Only if the NBSC declares that they
suspect a Horizon application issue should the following information be gathered before sending the
error to Fujitsu:

FAD code

A summary of what the NBSC have already checked with the PM
Where is the discrepancy (Cash / Stock etc)

Which report shows the balancing issue

Date / time report generated

Current TP / BP / Stock unit

ARON

If the Incident(s) in the incident history are not related, the Agent must record details regarding the issue
and enter it on the Call Management system by raising a new incident..

Alerts & Trends

The Agent must look out for key words that may identify a trend whilst noting the issue.. Key words
might be ‘usual problem’ or ‘it has happened again’. If Agent believes that there might be a recurring
issue they must check the site history by looking through the incidents in the incident history and note
any associated closed call reference numbers in the incident log. The Agent will also assign the Triole for
Service incident record appropriate codes and a priority as defined in “POA Call Enquiry Matrix and
Incident Prioritisation” SVM/SDM/SD/0023

Ending the Call

Whether the incident is going to be closed or progressed, the Agent must always give the caller a unique
incident record number, taken from the Triole for Service system,when ending the voice call, as follows:

“Your incident reference number is xxxxxxxx. Please always use this as a future
reference of this incident and if you require further information regarding this issue.”

4.2 Parent Incident

In the event that an incident is identified which could generate multiple calls to the HSD, a Parent
Incident is raised and all child incidents will be logged against this Parent Incident. This Parent will then
be used to capture the progress of the incident.

This can occur as a result of:

e High Cali Volumes: If HSD notice high call-volumes (benchmark of 15 calls waiting) the IMT will
investigate if there is a trend in calls and Incidence, using the Incident Management System. In
the event that a trend is identified, a working Parent Incident will be raised and sent to the
relevant SDU for investigation.

e SMC / SDU Identify Incident: SMC/SDUs will notify IMT in the event of an incident, who will
raise a master Incident and assign to the relevant SDU for investigation. HSD will be provided
with the Incident reference number.

incident in Triole for Service and reassign it to the HSD IMT action group

Raising A Parent Incident

In the event that a Parent Incdent is raised, IMT will gather as much information as possible regarding
the incident and log it all in the description field. This will include information on what is down (if known),
how many sites are affected, and who has been notified of the incident. Once the area of responsibility
is identified, the corresponding Service Delivery Manager will be contacted

The Major Incident Service Delivery Manager will advise on actions to be taken

Updating Parent Incident

The Parent Incident will continue to be checked and updated during the lifecycle of the incident and all
calls to the desk will be logged on this incident.

Closure of Parent Incident

Once a resolution has been implemented by the resolver, IMT will gain resolution confirmation
from a sample of Child Incidents. When IMT have the confirmation, the Parent Incident can also
be resolved and closed.

4.3. Communication of Business Impacting / High Priority or
Major Incident

The Major Incident Service Delivery Manager will review the Parent Incident and identify if the incident is
or is potentially Business / Service Impacting. If these criteria are met, extended communication will
take place as detailed below.

4.3.1 Updates to POL Live Service Desk

Following review of the Parent Incident, the Service Delivery Manager will confirm if and when POL Live
Service Desks is to be notified, in accordance with the Major Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001).
