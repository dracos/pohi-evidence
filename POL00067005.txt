affidavit in the civil proceedings, did you not?

with which we are concemed.

ight have been thinking that in November 2001 I have
sold my house and the proceeds went into a bank account with Nat West. However, I did sell some
furniture and the cash for that went into the business and I bought some goods in the cash and cany,

so when I tamed round and said that I took some money out, thinking about it, I can do that because

I put some myself, my own in.

through the books? Are you withdrawing that evidence?

Yes, sir.

And you knew, of course, that you were going to be seen again by Mr Patel.

> OQ Pp 2

Not in January, sir, no. I was put on police bail and returned in April where I went to the
police station in Stafford. I waited an hour and a half and Mr Patel wanted to interview me and I
said, “I haven’t got a solicitor with me. As a matter of common courtesy, if you had let me know I
would have had a solicitor present because I couldn’t afford a solicitor just to be sitting there” and I
would have had an interview with him. He wanted to interview me but I said I had the ~ think it’s
called the local solicitor on call from there.

Q. The position is this, Mr Page, that when your interviews with Mr Patel finished in January, he
told you in terms that there was a vast amount of documentation to be gone through and that he
would want to interview you again.

A. He did say thai(?) sir, yes.

there is no misunderstanding. My suggestion to you is this, that as time has gone on before this trial

understands the suggestion, as to whether he wants to deal with it.

MR JOHN: I am about to deal with it.

MR COOPER: That is my submission to your honour.

JUDGE WOOD: No, the question was perfectly proper. The answer has been given and the case ~

Q. So, it is a coincidence, is it, on your evidence, Mr Page, that at this stage, week 18, that is
when he started buying large quantities of euros?

A. No, as I said, he was always large amounts but [decided to put them into that ~

Q. So, the answer you gave a moment ago was a little misleading, was it not?

A. No, sir. In what way?

Q. Because you were suggesting to the jury a moment ago that the reason why you started at

week 18 to book bulk euros into your AM stock was because that was when Mr!

buying large quantities, your words a few minutes ago.

it.
MR COOPER: Your honour, that is all I have to say.
JUDGE WOOD: That is quite all right.
MR JORN: (To the witness) Let us just go back to 1129 so as to see whether you agree with this
proposition. Would you start from week 22, please, go to the inflation column at 18 8000 and just
run your eye down that, please, Mr Page and follow it down on 1130 as well.
A. Yes.
Q. Now, what we see there with the exception of week 35, where the figure is an odd one,
259,2204,
A. Yes, sir.

Q. What we otherwise see is an exact number of thousands ~-I am sorry, with one minor

POL00067005
POL00067005

A exception, week 27 -- it is 204,200, but that apart there are two features, are there not, about this
column if we follow it through from July 2002 down to the time of your arrest when the office was
audited. There are two features, do you agree ~ firstly, the figure each week either remains the
same as the previous week, weeks 25 and 6 for instance?

A. Hmm.

Q. But that apart, it moves up every week. There is a continuing inflation.

Yes.

tis always up, itis never down.

That is correct, sir, yes.

And the other feature is, apart from the two that I have just highlighted, is that these are exact,
D sound figures of thousands.

‘That is correct, sir.

You teli me. What is this figure supposed to mean on your evidence?

It is sterling equivalent of foreign currency.

And your explanation for what is in that column is that if

POL00067005

Al Q. To the nearest thousand?
A. Yes.
Q. Any explanation that you can come up with for the fact that the inflation figure gets bigger
and bigger every week?

Inflation figures because there are moye euros in stock, sire.

So, this shows the volume of euros in stock, does it?

Yes, sir. Ne ,

Axe you sure about that? Do you want to hang your case on that answer, do you?

JUDGE WOOD: No discrepancy?

A. No, you can never balance the office to nil, not the size of that office.

MR JOHN: Yes, but that is what you were trying to do, was it noi?

A. Yes, sir, but we never could do that.

Q. Your explanation to the jury for these inflation figures in round thousands of pounds is that if
you found there was a shortage when you balanced the office -

A. Asurplus, sir. The majority of times we ended up having a surplus,

Q. Allright, a surplus ~ you would round the figures because your anxiety was to see that the
office accounts balanced.

A. Balance to a couple of hundred pounds, sir, yes, but four or five hundred pounds. It’s what]
said yesterday.

Q. So, in other words, on your own account ~ which, let me make it clear if it is not clear already
~Ido not accept a word of ~ each week if there was a surplus, shall we say, of £450, you would
adjust that figure?

A. Yes, sir.

A. I would not put the surplus in knowing that somebody, an old lady, or whatever, would come

back and pick the money up.

ssi

JUDGE WOOD: I am just going to pause there. “Ts

Q. “Knowing that a customer would come and ask for the money back”.
A. Because we were individually stocked sir, and the members of staff would probably realise
when they balanced that they’re over and they would probably realise who they hadn’t given the

money to or whatever.

POL00067005

Did you ever say a word of that when you were interviewed?

Q
A. I don’t think I was asked those questions.
Q

Q. And let us leave little old ladies out of it. When you do your final cash account, if there

happens to be a shortage, however it has arisen, the shortage should be revealed, should it not, on

that cash account?

POL00067005

A. Well, lonly took the honey, yound it off or put the money down knowing that one of the ,
members of staff had told me that somebody had had the money.
Qe So, are you telling me that for every one of these weeks that we see from July 2002 until
4 January 2003, one of your members of staff came to you and had an explanation for every time
there was a surplus?
A. The majority of'time, sir. We used to turn over at least £600,000 per week and had a footfal

Q. During the period that is covered ‘by the indictment that this jury are trying, who were the

members of staff at your office?

Al Q. We-will then move to another topic.

JUDGE WOOD: If that is the case I am going to ask if Mr Page would like to take a break. I
realise that it is very hard work answering questions, particularly in cross-examination and you have
been doing that for quite a long time now.

I will carry on if you want to carry on, sir.

Ate you quite sure?

Tam, sir.

If you feel like a break between now and one o’clock, just say so.

‘No, unless the jury want a break.

answers, but we will carry on if that is all right, members of the jury. . I hope that it is. Very well.

A. Have you finished with this, sir?

Q. Yes, put it to one side for now. We will have to open it up later on but put it to oné side if it is
easier for you. At the end of each week, each of the stocks had to be balanced.

She was not trained up, no, sir. She knew bow to do the transactions, sir, but not how to

balance.

And Jane Batey started to be trained up really quite late in the day, did she not?

Mid-2002, yes, so in the summer?

I would say so, sir.

Q. When do you say that that started?

A. When Margaret started getting trained up which, as I said, maybe the same time as Jane
started doing the bureau, about mid ~ because I was struggling in the office after my ex-wife had
left.

JUDGE WOOD: You have been asked for a time. Can you try to help us?
POL00067005
POL00067005

MR JOHN: Let us just see whether that makes any sense. Taking any individual counter clerk — let
us just take Barbara Carey at random — at the end of the accounting week, normally a Wednesday
afternoon or evening, she would be required to balance her own stock, would she not?

Correct.

And the other clerks would be required to balance their own stocks.

Correct, even myself, sir:

Those were numbered stocks, were they not?

Yes, I had a stock myself.

What was that?

Off the top of my head, I don’t know, sir. It could have been 02001, I think.

You had 02001, did you? That is not the evidence we have heard from the staff.

JUDGE WOOD: I am just going to write this down, Mr Page, and I need to know if you agree.
“When Margaret signs, it means she has completed the final weekly account” --

She would have checked it, sir.

Yes, sir.

Do you meant that?

Q. “The individual stocks would be balanced by the till staff”. Is that the right way of putting it?
A. Yes, sir, and then can I carry on, sir?

Q. Please so carry on.

MR JOHN: [am sorry. I did not realise that you had not finished.

A. [just thought you might be interested — we have individual stocks and all the reports then go
to the back office Horizon system and that produces an office snapshot of everything that is done in
the whole week, stock and all the transactions that are done and what would happen then, either
unyself or Margaret the majority of Margaret, when it was coming near to the end of 2002, that you
put everything together and make sure that it balances with the office snapshot.

POL00067005
POL00067005

A. That is correct, my Lord.

MR JOHN: Is this a fair shorthand way of putting it, Mr Page, so that we understand the final cash
account for each week, that it is an armalgamation of what each individual stocks have declared?
A. That is correct because we have individual policies, stock policy, where some offices just have
an open till and just have one big office balance, but with that you can’t trace where a mistake is
made.

Q. Yes. Just going off at a brief tangent for a moment so that we understand the common sense
behind this, each counter clerk is responsible for their own stock?

A. That is correct, sir.

Q. And it is important that they are because if you have either a dishonest counter clerk or a very
careless counter clerk by them being responsible for balancing their own stock each week, you can
find out which one it is

A. That is correct, sir. Sometimes you may be £85.50 short because somebody’s till — and you
find out that that has happened to be a car tax amount, so you can go through their car taxes and
say, “Well, he obviously hasn’t paid his cheque or you’ve done the transaction but you forgot to

take the money” which does unfortunately bappen.

I can see that the clerk is going to seek to do what the jury have requested and we will carry on for

the moment anyway.

inflating the foreign currency figures. - That is right, is it not?

A

Q

‘That is incorrect, sir. If you look at weeks 20 and 21 it is nil, nil.

Oh yes. Let us deal with that because Mr Cooper has asked me to and I will. In week 19 we

see that there is 101,000 sterling declared and the foreign currency declared has jumped up ~- we

can accept, can we not, that the July week is special, if only because of the remming out? That is

fair, is it not?

A. Ifyou say so, sir.

Q. But we can see that the foreign currency figure is nearly 100,000.

Q. Were you waiting to see if there was going to be any query about your overnight holdings for
the next couple of weeks?

A. No.

Q. You sent in your ONCH figures in week 19, did you not?

I don’t know, sir. I can’t remember.

Well, having been brought up short by Mr Brown and told that you had not done so for seven

weeks, I imagine that you were on your best behaviour telling Bristol your ONCH figures
immediately afterwards, were you not?

A. Ican’t remember, sir. At that time my dad was in hospital. He*d just had a heart attack. I
can’t remember what I was doing. 1 don’t think I was in. I was in and out of the office.

Q. So, in week 20 and week 21, could this be right, that you were testing the water; you were
waiting to see if anybody would check up on your ONCH figures?

A. That is incorrect, sir.

Q. That is why we see that the office foreign exchange is balancing for weeks 20 and 21. You
did not hear anything more from Bristol, did you?

A. As far as I know, sir, no.

Q. No, and you then thought, I suggest, that it was safe to do what you had started doing to hide
your escalating thefts by inputting false figures into the foreign currency on hand?

A. That is incorrect.

Q. And that is how we get up to the 282,000 is it not?

A. (No audible reply)

Q. Tam going to leave this in one moment but just help me in case I have misunderstood. How is
it, Mr Page, looking at it sensibly, that when one looks at that inflation column starting in week 22,
188,000, week 23, 189,000, how can it be that these can always be exact round figures of thousands
with only the two exceptions that I pointed out? How can that possibly be right because these are,

on your evidence, Mr Page, sterling equivalent figures. HOW 6 i ‘bureau:stoc

Q. How is it easier for the office to balance when what you are doing is adjusting a figure that is
wrong?
A, Well, [found it easier, sir, and that’s that.

Q. tis falsification of accounts apart from anything else. You know that, do you not? It is false
accounting.

A. don’t believe so, sir, Iwas just making sure that the surplus wasn’t put in knowing too well
D that somebody may come back for it.

Q. Every week?

A. Most weeks, sir, yes.

Q. Are we going to hear from any of these people who were endlessly leaving their money lying
around and coming back for it?

A. don’t know, sir. I doubt it.

A. We used to deal with --

Q. Can you wait for the question? - some old-age pensioner cashes a giro for two week’s money
or six week’s money or something or two giros and gets only half of what she is entitled to as a

8 result of some error.

A. That is correct.

Q. Or gets £100 less than she is entitled to but then after a bit, if that is what has happened, she is

I quite likely to come back.

POL00067005
POL00067005

A. That is correct.

Q. And! fully appreciate that if at the end of a day one of your very nice staff were to think, “I
never gave that old Mrs Smith the full money she was entitled to. I can see that I’ve got £142.30
over here and she is entitled to it”, again, the jury and I might well understand. that you might think,
well, we'll stick that in an envelope, and not saying about the accounts.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Ican quite understand that sort of approach.

A. Yes.

Q. But I would then think that when next week she has had her envelope back, there would be
nothing then to declare, would there?

No, sir.

And everything would go on balancing correctly?

I would keep going on and on and on --

I cannot understand how it produces inflation. That is really the question asking you to -~

Well, if somebody came to me at the counter and I hadn’t paid them money, sir, maybe £89
something, that means that the till would show £89 over.

Q. Yes, if they come back for it-

A. But it might be the following week, sir, I don’t know,

Q. But that would be corrected, would it not? What we are looking at, as I understand it, is
increasing amounts and I am having difficulty, though the jury may not be having my difficulty, in
thinking about these people leaving regular amounts in the Post Office and it not being returned to
them. What do you say about that?

A. twas returned. We used to put it to one side. Not just that, we used to pay out over a quarter
ofa million pounds a week in pension allowances, one and a half, two thousand car taxes a month -

Q. Iam going to try to bring my note up to date, One of the difficulties I have is that if I ask
POL00067005

AI questions it is not so easy for me to record the answers and we need to get on.

OD: Yes, of course. (After a pause) I will read out what I have put and then I woul
be grateful if you would tell me if! should add to it. “When customers accidentally received less
than they should have done, the surplus was put on one side and returned to them, which might

happen in the following week. That would explain a surplus in that week. It often happened

because we had a very high turnover.” That is as far as I have got. Would-you like me to add

A. No, sir.
D Q. Twill leave it there.

A. Maybe when the office members were showing a surplus for reasons beyond them, we used to
have to show that, sir.

Q. Yes.

MR JOHN: I just want to ask you about some of these cheques before I move on, Mr Page, Would
you turn in. the jury bundle to page 249. 1 just want to come back briefly to this £278,000 cheque.

When you were first asked about this, Mr Page, and we see that it bears the date of 2 Jannary, your

yi account was thet Mr r “GRO lad given you this cheque to cater for the possibility that three of

his cheques would bounce over the Christmas period. Yes?
A. That is correct.

Q. That was the explanation that you gave.

8 A. That’s the explanation Mr:
Q. Yes, and that is the explanation you gave to Mr Patel when you were interviewed. So, it was
sitting there in the till against the likelihood or the possibility that those cheques were going to

HI bounce?

POL00067005

A. I don’t know, sir.

Q

A. He said they might bounce.

Q. They might bounce. And that didn’t bother you?

A. No, as I said earlier, ?’'d been dealing with Mr r quite a period of time and no, it
didn’t.

Q. Why did you not say to him, “If there’s any risk of these cheques bouncing, you can’t take the
euros away”?

A. Well, he gave me an explanation that the money would be coming into his account and
because of the Christmas period, Corus or whatever it was had shut down.

Q. Is this a post-dated cheque we see at 2497

A. Inwhat way, sir? I think he came in on the 3%, didn’t he?

Q. That is your evidence. We will see that I suggest that you said something quite different to Mr
Patel, but we will come to that in due course. You are clear now, are you, in your evidence that this

was given to you on 3 January? - me,

A. Either the 2™ or the 3", I don’t know.

Q. Let us not quibble about whether it was the 2” or the 3"; it is January, after Christmas?

Q. Let me be clear about this. Are you telling us that it was on that occasion when he handed
over this cheque that he said, “The three cheques I gave you previously may bounce?”

A. That is correct, sir, yes.

Q. We will look at your account in interview this afternoon but let us be clear about this. Your

evidence now is not that when he gave you those three large cheques he said, “These may bounce”
G

POL00067005
POL00067005

but that he told you that later?

A. No, sir.

Q. Let us see if we can get the chronology right. *

A. For euros before Christmas.

Q. That is right. On that occasion was he then saying that there might be a problem with them or
was he not then saying that?

A. No, he wasn’t saying that, sir. He came in after Christmas and told me that.

Q. “lt was later, after Christmas, that he told me that"?

A. That is correct.

MR JOHN: So that we can trace this through, I am going to invite the jury, if they think it is
helpful, to note on page 249, “See page 982” because ] am now going to invite Mr Page and the jury
to look at page 982. So as to keep things neat, if the jury think it will be helpful, to write on page
982 “see 249”, or we could just take out 249, if that is easier. Whichever way suits you, Mr Page,
can we look at the three cheques on page 982, please?

A. Thave looked at it, sir, but I haven’t studied it, no.
Q. Really? Itis a very important document, is it not, in your life?

fi A. itis, sir, yes.

Q. Have you found anything in it in relation to what you have been saying to this jury that does
not tie up?
A. Inwhat way, sir?

S MR COOPER: Your honour, some of the prefaces to questions put to Mr Patel of, “Mr Patel, this
is not a memory game” was quite right and I wonder whether the same courtesy could be afforded
to Mr Page? If there is a point, quite properly, that my learned friend has, perhaps he could direct

HI him to it?

UDGE WOOD: Ido not think that there is anything improper about the question. It is really very

hormal for counsel to make a general enquiry before focusing on the specific. Obviously the jury

will know that the report is not short and the witness does not profess to be an accountant, but I do
. not think that there is anything wrong in the question.
MR JOHN: Can we have the answer then?

<Q. Can we have the answer?

the rounding up of those thousands of figures? Have you spotted the fact that Mr Liddell makes no

Q. You know, do you not, that he has examined whether there could have been a buile
office of £282,000 worth of foreign currency. t
A, That is correct, yes.

Q. And you know his conclusion, do you not?

A. That there wasn’t, no.

Q. There was not and you know that that was Mr Patel’s conclusion as well, do you not?
A. That is correct.

Q. That it simply was not possible that there could have been £282,000 worth of euros in he
office.

A. Thatis correct.

Q. But the inflation figure that appears on the foot of the schedule, which you have been
explaining to us, implies that there were.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And that inflation schedule, you have explained how that comes to pass because it is figures
that you put in.

A. That is correct.

Q. So, on your evidence there should in fact have been, when the auditors went in, £282,000

worth of foreign currency. i

Well, where is it then?

A. Idon’t know, sir.

No, I deny that.

T want to deal with just one other matter. Who had keys to the office, Mr Page?
Myself, Jane and Margaret.

And you, as the sub-postmaster, of course, was the boss?

‘That is correct, sir, yes.

You could let yourself into that office at any time you liked.

Yes, sir and I did.

And had you done it ~I know that you will not accept that you did -- you could have gone in at

any stage, day or night, and taken 2,000 here, 5,000 there and no one would bave seen you.

A. That is very doubtful, sir.

A. The reason being, sir, that the safe should be on a time lock.

POL00067005

Q. I will get you to explain that in a minute.

A. Lwill do, sir, yes.

Q. The suggestion was that it would have been easy for you to make away with thousands of
pounds in small numbers of thousands, regularly without anyone noticing and your answer was, “I
don’t agree that that would be” --

A, Because the majority of the time, sir, the safe should be on atime lock. There’s four safes and
what you do, you turn a manual key to how many hours you want the safe to be locked. P’'m not
saying it was done all the time, sir, but the majority of the time it was.

Right, you say that. And who would do that?

The fast person leaving. It would be myself or Margaret or -

“Last person out would do that”,

So, one way forward would be that if you close at six o’clock, leave the building at that stage
—Ido not know if that is -

A. The safe should not open again until maybe seven or eight o’clock the following morning,

Q. Yes, so you would be able to set the time clock so that no one could get into the safe for
eleven hours, say?

A, Yes, and if we used to come in, because we were connected to the Redeare System, Romeo, so
if you came in out of office hours, you would have a phone call round the back asking what you are
doing there, and whatever, and that would be logged.

Q. Yes. “Romec would telephone me if I went in out of hours and that would be logged”?

A. Yes, sir.

MR JOHN: Romec are a pretty unreliable organisation, are they not?

A. Some parts of it, sir, especially the electricians.

That is correct, sir.

So, we cannot really rely upon them picking up any defaults, can we?

They should do, sir, because I was paying x amount per year.

I know that we should do but we would be wrong, would we not?

That is something you would have to take up with Redcare then, sir, isn’t it? -

We know that from all the evidence. You are not disputing, are you, that your rate board was

inoperative for months?

No, I am not, sir.

And it was down to Romec to replace it?

Yes, sir.

So, we cannot place too much reliance upon them, can we?

No, I don’t know, sir. [ used to rely on them regarding the alarm, sir, yes.

Now, I want to deal with your suggestion that euro sales, sales of large quantities of euros to
would regularly be entered by you into the Ford money changer and Mr
then not pick them up until a day or two later.

That is correct, sir, yes,

And you stand firm on that, do you, Mr Page?

Yes, Ido.

And you say that the rate boards will show that, do you?

Yes, I do, sir, yes.

If you are telling the truth, they should do.

Because he would buy whatever you could lay your hands on?
That is correct, sir, yes.

But initially did he say, “Can you get me 100,000 or 200,000 euros?

No, that’s as it built up, sir, yes.

Yes, and as time went on you just got in as much as you could?

That is correct. As I said, it started from 1999 onwards.

Yes. So, assume on a Monday he calls you and asks, “How many euros have you got

available today” and you said half'a million?

A. Well, whatever I’d got in stock, sir, yes.

Q. Allright. Let us assume that it was half a million and you would tell him that. Is that right? I
just want to see if J have got the system right. Would he say, “What's the rate?”

A. He probably would do, sir, or just ask how many euros I'd got in stock.

Q. Would he ask the rate is the question.

A. 1am not saying all the time. He may do, sir, but not all the while, no.

JUDGE WOOD: He might ask the rate but not all the time?

A. No, sir - 1 can’t answer yes or no with that sir.

A. No, I didn’t say that. I said I can’t remember. He may have done; he may not have done.

Q. You cannot remember one way or the other but the one thing that you are sure about is that he
never at any time aifempted to negotiate the rate with you?

A. He may have done when he first started, I very much doubt it, but there’s one rate and that’s
the rate I gave him.

Q. Would you look at the interviews, please, tab 5, page 16?

Q. Yes, please. You are being asked about one particular transaction which was reversed, Do you
remember this?

Q. Perhaps we should start at the bottom of 15. You were asked about a transaction at 10.17 for
36,000 euros. Do you see?

A. Hom.

Q. And then another done for 80,000 euros?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you say that that is reversed, over on page 16. “The 80,000 is reversed, which
leaves us with only one transaction”.

A. Yes.

Q. And then one minute later you do another transaction of 72,000. Your answer, “I’m probably
just trying to balance the books.”

A. And the Ford money changer, sir, yes.

Q. Question: “So, was Mr physically present when all this was going on?” “I would
very much doubt it, yes.”

A. That is correct.

2. Apart from that one ith here in the context ofa reverse transaction, is

there anywhere within your interviews that you can recall where you suggest that Mr}

Q, So that on the till roll, the Ford money changer till roll, which of course, has a date and a time
on if, if Mr P GRO fen came in two days later te collect it, the receipt would reflect a
transaction which was not taking place that day but one that had taken place two days earlier?

things done as quickly as we could to make it easier for ourselves later on.

could have failed to miss the fact that those two figures bear no relation whatever te each other.

A. According to this, sir, no.

Q. So, can we just place ourselves, if we can, back in the Rugeley office on the day when this

not that figure but £283,000?

B Q. How can that possibly be a mistake?
A. Itis not amistake, sir. It's what — the bulk, 188,000, what was in the AM stock.

to be put into Horizon so that the office will balance at the end of the week. There is no answer to

A. According to this schedule, yes, sir.

Q. Are you questioning this schedule?

A. Ne, I am just saying, according to this schedule I'm looking at now.

JUDGE WOOD: Yes, you have said that more than once and please do not think I am criticising,
Mr Page. It is just that the schedules have been provided to the defence who have engaged expert
accountants to study them and were there to be errors in that schedule no doubt those would have
been pointed out. We are working on the basis that they are right.

A. Okay, sir.

Q. So when you say, “according to the schedule”, fine, but we are working on the basis in this
court that the schedule is right. We will carry on.

MR JOHN: [tis not a criticism of you, Mr Page, in that respect, at all. Your comment is perfectly
proper. Just before I move on to the 23", can we engage in this exercise, please? Do you still have

because you key in 147,000 euros at the 1.67 rate and that is what the FM machine tells you to

have made a mistake. It is because we have not got column headings. That is my excuse, anyhow.
You are quite right. Thank you, Mr Tatford — ahead of me as always. 88,000.

JUDGE WOOD: That is the cheque to be paid?

MR JOHN: Yes, it is not 97. 97 is what the Crown say is the amount that should have been paid.
It is because we do not have the headings at the top of each page. It is my fault, and. I am sorry. So,

correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And therefore he gives you a cheque for 88,023.95.
A. Yes, sir.

Q. And while we are dealing with it, the schedule tells us that the ordjfary rate, which would
have been on the fax sheet that day for an under 5,000 transaction wold have been 1.4974 and in
bold in the next column if the special rate had been applied, 1.5147. Yes?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. So, you were allowing him a preference of the difference between 1.5147 up to 1.67?

A. That is correct, sir.
Q.

Sixteen points better. If we then go back, please, to 1423 to see what happened on Mr

I behalf at Lichfield that day, that same sum of euros are 100 and he sells that for
£92,742 odd. That seems to be right, does it not?
A. Yes, sir,

Q. So, he is £4,700 to the good before the end of that day?
c

POL00067005
POL00067005

A. According to that, sir, yes.

Q. And the point is this: he has come into the office and has transacted with you before half past
seven in the morning. You have keyed those figures in and by the end of the day he has paid the
equivalent of 100 euros in elsewhere.

A. That is correct.

Q. So, on your evidence this is against the nommal pattern by August; this is a transaction where -
he has come in in the morning, done the transaction with you, you have keyed it in and someone has
gone straight to Lichfield and made nearly £5,000 profit in the same day. Right?

A. According to this, sir, yes.

Q. So, the next day. Back to 988, if you please. 23 August. This is in reality nine o'clock in the
morning, two transactions done simultaneously because we can forget the minute, can we not?

was balancing perfectly apart from the exceptional week when Mr Davis came in and found the
office in a mess.

A things. The first is to do with that lease, if you remember, the first lease of the Post Office when Mr
John was interested to find out, first of all, what its date was and whether it made a specific
provision or not for the bureau. We have checked, and I have learnt, that as it happens, the defence

do not have a copy of that lease. Mr Cooper has been working on the basis of instructions as to

B
what the restrictions were in it but has not actually got copy so that question cannot be answered in
detail at all. Mr Cooper quite rightly asks me to make the point that when there are leases prepared
the landlord has a copy as well as the tenant, and the landlord, of course, is the Post Office, so he

referred to the business unit. All that I am going to say is that one cam perhaps accept that if there
pl ae over 1,000 Post Offices, to get the 1997 version of the lease of a former tenant of a sub-post
office and get it to the Waterfront Courts might not be quite as easy as one might hope. It could be
not that easy. I do not think we are going to see the lease and Ido not think that, frankly, it is going

to affect your decision in the case very much sol do net propose:

MR JOHN: If we can get hold of it we will, but I do not hold out any more hope than your honour

does.
B JUDGE WOOD: No, and please do not think that this judge would mind if a fairly cursory attempt
is made to produce it. It is not central to the case.
MR JOHN: Thank you very much. (to the witness) Through you, Mr Page, can I attempt to correct
one matter. You agreed with me when we were looking at the 22a “August, that it must have

A. No, sir.

Q. All right. Let me take two other examples which may not give rise to that problem. We are

you have told us that the normal practice was that he would ring up, you would tell him how many
euros you had; you would put it through the money changer and he would come in a day or two

later. All right, just so that we have the context?

A. Yes.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Because the clock is back all the time, is it not, throughout this -~

A. Yes, unless it’s back in the summer and it would be the normal time then, sir.

Q. Nothing may turn on it but there we are. It is “earlyish” in the morning depending on what
time you are used to getting up. Allitig

Q. Again, from the timing is that in all probability a transaction that you yourself conducted?
A. Yes, sir.

Q. Very unlikely to have been anybody else, is it not?

Thank you very much, members of the jury.

MR JOHN: Your honour, may I say on behalf of all of us that there is not a problem with half past

JUDGE WOOD: No, the problem is, I think, the following Monday, the 11". I believe that is right.
