Dear Ms Williams,
Many thanks. I would certainly like to meet the Minister. May I accept the suggestion of Thursday 17" September
from 15:15 to 15:45? As it happens I shall be having lunch that day in the House of Lords, so could easily meet there if
she preferred. Alternatively, should I come to her office in Victoria Street?

Yours sincerely,

James Arbuthnot
