Dear Tim

Thank you for your time on the call yesterday, which was very helpful.

Following the comments you provided when we spoke yesterday, I have now finalised the witness statement and it has
been proof read; the finalised version is attached, in PDF format.

You will see that, in paragraph 15 (on page 5), the previous reference to the pro forma advert for a Postmaster role
now refers to a business plan sent to Louise Dar instead. I have attached this document (it is in Excel format); within
the Personal Details tab of the spreadsheet, it includes wording that Post Office does not guarantee the accuracy of
indicated branch remuneration.

The purpose of the witness statement is to provide written evidence to support Post Office's case and which will be
used as evidence in court. The witness statement is a crucial part of Post Office's case, designed to show it in its
strongest light.

You may be asked to attend court to explain the issues covered in the witness statement to the Judge, and be asked
questions on the evidence by the other side.

The statement of truth within your witness statement

Awitness statement must have signed "statement of truth". This is a statement confirming that the person making it
believes the facts stated in the document are true; it appears in your witness statement on the final page. The
penalties for signing a statement of truth without an honest belief in the truth of the facts being verified are potentially
severe. A person who makes a false statement in litigation in an attempt to interfere with the course of justice will be
in contempt of court, which is punishable by a prison sentence of up to two years.

Please could you:

carefully review your attached witness statement;

if you are satisfied with its content, please sign the statement of truth on page 12;

email me a full scan of the signed witness statement (not just the final page containing your signed statement of truth);
and

send your original, hard copy signed witness statement (in full) to Victoria Brooks at Womble Bond Dickinson, Temple
Quay, 3 Temple Back East, Bristol BS1 6DZ (ref: VMB1/364065. 1369).

Thank you very much for your hard work in getting this over the line.
Kind regards

James
