Review of Expert Witness Report : Claim CR101947

Report received 6" February from POL. Written by Jason Coyne from Best Practice
Group ple. Law Society 2003 Accredited Expert Witness No. 229.

Background

POL have been in dispute with the Post Mistress (PM) of this Outlet since mid 2000.
Essentially, POL had made a claim against the PM for losses at her Outlet against
which she had counter-claimed that the problem was caused by the Horizon system
and she was refusing to release the equipment as she believed an examination of it
would vindicate her. A Court Order was made on 19" February 2003 that a computer
expert examine the equipment.

POA’s first involvement was a request made 8" August 2003 by POL that we provide
a Witness Statement “about the Horizon equipment and what it contains (or doesn’t)
and give Mrs W a chance to object”. I think what POL wanted to happen was for the
Court to overturn the Court Order so that POL could recover the equipment.

[DN : Check my Daybook in CRE02 for any rough notes]

On 20" August I received a fax letter from POL explaining the situation and
requesting a Witness Statement to the effect that there was nothing on the equipment
that would assist the PM in her claim and that it should be returned.

On 21* August I replied, by email, explaining what the situation was, what
information existed on the equipment and what would happen if it was switched on
and that we would not allow 3" parties access. I also explained how we could help
POL. I received no reply to this email.

On 6" February POA received a copy of the Expert’s report with a request from POL
for an early response. POL are concerned that the Expert’s opinion (that the system
was at fault) might set a precedent against future POL prosecutions.

Note that this is a civil and not a criminal case and there is some doubt if case law
from successful POL criminal prosecutions applies.

Today (12"" February)

I’ve spoken with Jim Cruise (POL) and I get the impression that he/POL are quite
concerned about this case. He confirmed that :

1. The equipment has still not been recovered.

2. The equipment was not examined as part of the Expert’s review.

3. Their primary objective is to get the equipment returned.

4 There is a Case Management Conference on 25/02/04 where they would want

to challenge the Expert’s report if any such challenge were possible.

5. They want anything! that might indicate that Cleverleys was no better or
worse than any other 6 Counter Outlet.
On PS. I have asked for an analysis of HSH calls from 01/01/00 to 20/11/00 for
Cleverleys and 20 other 6 Counter Outlets chosen at random with full error code
analysis. I should have this today/tomorrow (13").

On P4. I shall be writing a report that brings together some of my email of 21/08/04
and a response to some of the opinions in the Expert’s report. The risk is that we get
into a ‘no-win’ argument about whether his opinion is valid or not. Blue screens and
system freezes have always been a problem and the stock HSH reply has always been
to re-boot.

This report should go to Keith Baines.
