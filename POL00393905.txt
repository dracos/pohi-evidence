Management Summary

1, Transaction Processing (Page 17-20)

e The length of the current TP CLASS error learning curve is at least 20 weeks and the level of the outlets in the
sample gives confidence that this is statistically sound. The tail of the learning curve remains well above the
baseline for over 20 weeks after conversion. If this continues the effect on TP extends to September 2001

¢ From the limited information available for converted offices at the moment, the learning curve is assumed to return
to manual baseline after 30 weeks.

1. ITIP

According to ICL Pathways figures the SLA of 100% of transaction files received by TIP for Day D failed by 0.53%
however ITIP’S figures suggest that it was failed by 0.74%. (Page 21)

Pathways SLA’s for April -PONU derived SLA’s
Day B 97.82% Day B 98.80%
Day C 99.20% Day C 98.80%
Day D 99.47% Day D 99.06%

2. Outlet Systems Group (22-24)
© Transaction delivery targets were missed on 19 days out of 24. Tracked under OSG P101.
© 1 keying error resulted in 120 outlets needing an ATP, although ICL Pathway’s co-operation prevented a bigger

impact. Procedures are now in place to prevent a repeat

3. _NBSC - Incident Resolution (Page 8-12)

There was a surge in client counter procedure calls during the last week in April. This was caused by the re-valuation
of Royal Mail stock following a price change. (BSM problem no. P10000162).

5. Customer Service Tracking (Pages 15-16)

Horizon offices seem to be performing as well as non-Horizon offices in all arcas with the exception of queuing in sub-
post offices. However, Mystery Shopping results for Horizon offices have shown that initially queuing time increases
in the first few weeks after Horizon has been installed but then settles down to a similar level as before Horizon was
installed, Therefore, this result is probably caused by this effect and will improve in the long run.
