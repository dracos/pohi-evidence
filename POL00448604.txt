Hi Saf,

I can confirm that after reviewing all 7 of your branches in regards to cash declarations and returning excess cash
the only branch that I had a concern about was the cash declarations for New Hall Lane for a period of 3 months.
After visiting the branch and investigating further I can see that all of the cash declaration receipts are present at the
branch and the reason for the failures were that they may have been completed just after the 7pm deadline. I
appreciate that the branch was trialling to open later in a bid to provide DPD and EVRi services out of the branch.

I can confirm that after putting in place slight changes the branch has returned to normal and is now completing
100% of the cash declarations since November.

Thanks,

Keith
