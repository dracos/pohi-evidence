2. MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

KEY POINTS — MARCH 2000

In March Pathway Management Support Unit received 434 incidents, as compared to 267 in February, thus showing an
increase of 38.48% .

The most numerous incidents were for the Non-polled incident class, accounting for 245 incidents received or 56.5%. This was
followed by "receipts and payments" (migration) comprising 140 of all incidents received, or 32.3%. Please refer to table and
reports 3.1 to 3.3 for further detail.

With the introduction of the new BIMS system from the 1/3/00, this has enabled the use of the new incident classes and
descriptions, hence the revision of this report to bring it line with the new service. Of the 434 received, 302 of these were
cleared, where analysis indicates that 97.9% of all incidents were successfully cleared achieving the Sday SLA. This has
improved since February by 3.8% with the introduction of the new system.

Report 3.4 shows the closure status of incidents, whereby in March 114 were Pathway fault and 165 No Fault in Pathway. Of
the 165 which were No Fault in Pathway, the majority of these incidents occurred due to "receipts and payments" (migration).
