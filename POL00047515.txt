Please find enclosed the amended schedule booklet, statement from me and a statement from Kate
Rosenthal (the branch manager at Huyton post office). In Kate’s statement she confirms that the
stock issued was CC and not HH for weeks 40 to 42. Also in Kate’s original statement she has
covered the process for paying a pension and allowance voucher and the office procedure for
accounting these vouchers. Also enclosed are the papers that were used in the post office
discipline procedure.

I am now in the process of putting together the group vouchers were the amount has been over
stated. I have noticed that for week 46, 2 x £25.85 vouchers are in the bundle of which one has
been claimed correctly and one has been overstated by £100. However these 2 vouchers belong to
the same person. One voucher is the last one in one book and one voucher is the first one in the
new book. The inference is :
1. She has performed two transactions by paying out £25.85 from the old book, then
£125.85 from the new book.
1. Or if it has been one transaction of 2 vouchers and is a genuine error and £125.85 had
been inputted, then the customer would have received £251.70.

Either way the clerk would realise that the amount of £125.85 is not correct, because she has
to obtain the new book and scan it out as being receipted to the customer.

Do you wish me to obtain if possible a statement from this customer or a print out of her
payment record from the Department for Works and Pensions?

Thave enclosed a copy of the two vouchers and the print out.
