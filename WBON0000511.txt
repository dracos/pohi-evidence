Dear all,

On Wednesday @14:00pm we have our first PLSG call, which will take place on a fortnightly basis going
forward.

Ahead of that call please find attached:

Decision paper on settlement (+ draft letter).

Briefing Paper on EDQs

If possible, I would like these calls to be shorter than the meetings and to focus only on issues raised. As
such, I do not intend to circulate:

Agendas - unless a specific point is raised beforehand by an attendee on behalf of the area of the business
that they represent; or

Open actions — unless they are urgent. I will pick these up with the individuals outside of the call and or in
the F2F meetings.

Many thanks
