GLO COMMUNICATIONS — HORIZON ISSUES JUDGMENT

GROUP LITIGATION — HORIZON ISSUES TRIAL

REACTIVE MEDIA LINES TO TAKE IF DISRUPTION TO NETWORK EG SOME BRANCHES
REFUSE TO OPEN

e The vast majority of our 11,500 Post Office branches are open for business as usual.

e Weare sorry that a small minority of branches are closed but we’re doing all we can
to work with those postmasters to re-open as soon as possible. Customers are
advised to use other branches in the area [contact xxxx].

e Customers can continue to have confidence in Post Office products and services.
Around 47 million transactions a week are processed through Post Office branches
on behalf of other large-scale organisations including high street banks, utility
companies and Government departments.

e The litigation is part of a long-running dispute between Post Office and a small
proportion of mainly former postmasters.

e The case is complex and is being heard in stages, currently scheduled through t 2020.
The Judgment concerning the Horizon computer system covered technical matters
relating to the 20-year period spanned by individual claims, during which time there
have been significant changes, with some of the systems and processes referenced
no longer in existence.
