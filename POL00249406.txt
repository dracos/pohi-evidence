Owain, Tony
Briefing note - transaction acknowledgements (TA)

Please find attached Post Office's best practice note on TA. In summary, there are three products which use TAs:

. Camelot;
. Post & Go; and
. Paystation.

A postmaster has no option but to accept a TA in order to trade. However, if a postmaster had an issue with a TA they
could contact NBSC. There is no script for an NBSC worker to follow in the event of such a complaint and POL have no
data as to how many complaints have been made. However, it is our understanding that none of the guidance provided to
SPMRs brings to their attention the ability to complain about TA's by contacting the NBSC.

Deloitte are currently producing a report on Non-Counter Transactions, which is expected during the course of this week
and will cover TA's, and we shall provide more details on this area once deciphered.

Kind regards

Amy
