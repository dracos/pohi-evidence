Apologies had been received from Kay Linnell and Andy Parsons.

Chris Aujard introduced Patrick Bourke to the Working Group. Patrick was attending the meeting to assist
continuity in the absence of Andy Parsons.

1. Minutes of 8" December meeting

Kay Linnell had suggested an amendment to the minutes of the last meeting about the time JFSA needed
to consider cases where Second Sight did not recommend mediation. Chris Holyoak suggested a small
number of amendments relating to the scheduling of cases. All amendments were agreed.

Action: Secretariat to amend the minutes of December’s minutes in line with Kay and Chris’s
suggestions.

2. Message from Alan Bates

Alan Bates had sent an email to the Secretariat on 8 January suggesting that the Working Group meeting
should be cancelled pending a response from the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Employment
Relations and Consumer Affairs to the recent Adjournment Debate in Westminster Hall and JFSA’s
subsequent letter to her. Alan explained that he hoped for significant changes on following the Minister's
response and consequently he did not wish to be involved in making decisions within the Working Group.
His principal concern was the 2 cases scheduled for discussion where Second Sight had not recommended
mediation (agenda item 6a).

Chris Aujard said that Post Office had been keen for the meeting to take place in order that progress could
be made on other agenda items as well as individual cases.

The Chair welcomed Alan’s clarification of his email and said that given Post Office had expressed a wish
for the meeting to go ahead and as a result he had decided that it should. He asked for further clarification
that Alan was content for the Working Group to discuss cases where Second Sight had recommended
cases for mediation but Post Office had voted against (agenda item 6b). Alan said that, notwithstanding his
ongoing view that this was not the role of the Working Group, he accepted that the discussion could take
place although he would not take part in it.

3. Scheduling of proposed face to face meetings in 2015

The Secretariat had circulated a list of potential dates for Working Group meetings in the first half of the
year. All members of the Working Group were available on the proposed dates for February, April and
May. However, some members of the Working Group were not available for the proposed dates for March
and June.

Action: Secretariat to schedule Working Group meetings for 13 February, 16 April and 14 May; and
to circulate alternative dates for meetings in March and June.

4. Structured Discussion

Following the discussion at the last Working Group, the Secretariat had circulated a paper setting out a
proposal for how applicants could be offered a “structured discussion” in some cases where, for example,
Second Sight had described their application as weak and the Working Group did not consider them
suitable for mediation. The Chair said that, if agreed, this would offer 3 possible outcomes for the Working
Group to consider as opposed to the current choice between mediation or not, specifically Working Group
members could vote:
POL00043633
POL00043633

¢ in favour of mediation;
¢ against mediation but in favour of a structured discussion; or
e against mediation and a structured discussion.

The following points were made in discussion:

«this option was already available within the Scheme and Second Sight had used a similar
formulation in a number of CRRs;

« it was helpful to have greater definition of how a discussion might be structured;

eit was also helpful to have an alternative means of resolution in cases where, for example,
applicants had made significant mistakes; and

e there should be a means for applicants to have their case looked at again if significant new
information comes to light through a structured discussion.

The Working Group agreed to the proposed approach to a structured discussion subject to one additional
element. The Chair asked Post Office to consider allowing applicants, via their advisors, to refer their case
back to the Working Group in the circumstances where significant new facts or information came to light
through a structured discussion. In these circumstances the Chair would use his casting vote to determine
whether the case should proceed to mediation. Post Office agreed.

Action: Secretariat to amend the proposal in line with the Working Group’s decision and draw up a
document for applicants setting out the terms of a structured discussion.

The Chair asked the Post Office to consider whether a structured discussion might be offered to the
applicants in the two cases where the Post Office had declined mediation following a Working Group
decision. Post Office agreed to consider the issue.

Action: Post Office to consider offering a structured discussion to the applicants in cases M015 and
M030.

Additional Agenda Item: Update on Part Two Report

The Chair asked Second Sight to provide an update on progress in completing their Part Two report. lan
Henderson reported that:

e Second Sight had issued 97 questions to Post Office on 9 December 2014;
e Post Office had replied on 7 January;
¢ Post Office’s response had:
© answered 64 questions, providing new information;
© suggested 22 questions were disproportionately wide;
© suggested 7 questions were out of scope; and
© sought clarification on 4 questions.
« Second Sight and Post Office had met on 9 January to discuss Post Office’s response and made
further progress; and
¢ in his assessment, they remained on course to complete the report by the end of March.

The Chair asked if Post Office was able to answer the question on suspense accounts that had been posed
for several months. lan reported that the information had not yet been provided. The Chair asked that this
be addressed as a matter of urgency and suggested that Post Office arrange a meeting between Second
Sight and Post Office finance staff to do so. This was agreed.

Action: Post Office to arrange a meeting with Second Sight to discuss suspense accounts.
lan reported that there were also issues with a number of other questions including:

e the provision of emails covering a year (2008) from all staff based in Bracknell;
POL00043633
POL00043633

¢ issues around branch closure; and
¢ the provision of evidence of any criticism of Post Office in any prosections.

lan said that Post Office had suggested that the first two questions were too wide and that they were not
aware of any issues relating to the third but were unable to prove this was the case.

Chris Aujard said that Post Office were prepared to answer any question that related to a case in the
Scheme in order that the Part Two Report should allow CRRs to be completed and assist with mediation.

The Chair said that the Part Two report was intended to address whether there is an issue with Horizon so
that it might assist applicants in understanding how a loss may be incurred. It was essential that this was a
completed by the end of March. Looking at the specific questions posed in the discussion, he agreed that
the first two questions were too wide and asked Second Sight to narrow their questions. Where Post Office
were unable or unwilling to answer a question Second Sight should say so. This was agreed.

Action: Second Sight to narrow the scope of their question on access to emails from staff based in
Bracknell, and branch closure.

Action: Second Sight to complete their Part Two Report by end March 2015.

Chris Holyoak highlighted that:

e there were a number of cases where due dates for comments on draft CRRs were pending; and
e that Second Sight were awaiting an update on the provision of legal documents.

applicants. An update on the provision of legal files would be provided shortly.

listed under agenda items 6d and 6e.

meeting.

M041 for February’s meeting.
