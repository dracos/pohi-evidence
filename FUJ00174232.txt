Subject: RE: HNGX update on Weekend B/C
Roger,

I met with the Post Office programme team today and we have jointly put together a revised schedule which will mean
that Post Office will not be looking for any additional compensation from Fujitsu. There are a number of containable
risks introduced through the Pilot period and I will be taking Customer Services through these tomorrow to get their
agreement. Once I have this I can publish the revised schedule. Is this OK?

Roger,

Sorry for the delay in responding. Due to the pressures within the Programme meeting the Weekend B/C date we took
the decision to give priority to the Data Centre Migration which has impacted progress on the Branch Migration
activities. We are currently showing that we will be unable to achieve a number of milestones for this which will hit the
critical path for Counter Roll Out. The teams are reviewing all possibilities for mitigation we can think of to see
whether we could recover the position and will not have a position that we can put to Post Office until tomorrow
evening/Friday. I could provide Kamata-San with a copy of the current milestones although it is likely that these will
change by Friday. Should I wait until then to provide him with a set of revised Milestones?

Can you give me the latest milestone chart of this project? It is helpful to understand where we are standing in the
overall project.

Please pass on my personal congratulations to the team.

Kamata-san — can you please circulate this (suitably translated) to the GSC (including Mazuka and perhaps Ishida) to
let them know that we have dealt with at least one of the toxic contracts. Please consult Roger if you need more
information.

congratulations to you and all the joint POL and Fujitsu team.

This was a very complex and critical migration, with the potential for
massive impact on the business if it failed, and huge opportunity for
things to go wrong. In over 30 years in IT, this is probably the biggest
most complex and critical such exercise I have been involved in, including
the introduction of competition in gas.

The fact that it was executed so smoothly and with such success is a great
tribute to the thorough and professional planning and attention to detail
leading up the migration and the excellent team work and commitment over
the weekend.

This is a huge achievement - well done again to all.
Regards
David Gray
