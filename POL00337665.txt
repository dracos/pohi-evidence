Scope and Content

* Currently the CVM team have no standard
process for receiving, responding to or
tracking Contract Interpretation.

¢ This creates a poor customer experience,
duplication of effort within the CVM Team
and loss of historical data.

¢ The goal is to have a repeatable process
which creates a “go-to” place for sharing
Contractual information and allows for

organic growth. €
