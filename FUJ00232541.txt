1.0 Service Provision
1.1. Summary
1.1.1 General
LAL The Transaction Benchmark Service provides a measure of Horizon system

performance for an agreed set of transactions (Section 2.0).

1.1.1.2 Measurement (or benchmark evaluation) is limited to the system components of
the nominated transactions, no account being taken of any manual or
human/computer interface components.

1.1.1.3. The service is provided for every Major Release.
1.2 Service Principles
1.2.1 General

1.2.1.1 Benchmark evaluation shall be carried out in accordance with the method
described in Section 2.0.

1.2.1.2 Benchmark evaluations shall be auditable at all stages of the process. Documents
to be retained include:

e The video recordings of the benchmark test transactions

« A spreadsheet comprising the processed benchmark results, the data captured
from the video recordings and the intermediate processing, including any
revision made thereto following review by Post Office Ltd.

e The test scripts
Such documents shall be retained for a period of seven years.

1.2.1.3. Benchmark evaluations shall be supported by this document and the performance
statement arising out of each evaluation, CS/PER/046, “COUNTER
TRANSACTION PERFORMANCE - MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS”.

1.2.1.4 I The contracted Target Times against which the benchmark evaluation shall be
measured are stated in Section 3.0.

1.2.1.5 CS/PER/046, “Counter Transaction Performance - Measurement and Results”,
shall be up-issued following every benchmark evaluation and shall include:

1.3.2

1.3.3

1.3.4

1.3.5

The data recording part of the benchmark evaluation is carried out prior to the
implementation of a Major Release. This is not to say that the software
implementation is dependant in any way upon the benchmarking exercise or the
results arising therefrom. It is the successful completion of end-to-end testing,
which is conducted under the control and management of Post Office Ltd, that
leads to the implementation of the software into the live environment (Ref.
VI/STR/064 “Testing Approach for the Horizon System” para. 4.4.3.6).

The service comprises:

¢ Benchmark evaluation of individual system component times within:
e Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS)
e Automated Payments Service (APS)
e Order Book Control Service (OBCS)

e Benchmark evaluation of the transaction level aggregate of the counter system
component times for the Network Banking Service (NBS) transaction types.

The system component times are generated from the execution of a representative
set of transactions (Section 2.0 Table 1) on a test rig representing a real Post
Office branch. Normal counter operation is assumed

The outcomes of the benchmark evaluation are compared against the counter
system component contractual times (Section 3.0) and the results of the previous
benchmark evaluation. Any adverse variances are analysed and explained as far as
is practicable.

The initial benchmark evaluation results shall be presented to Post Office Ltd for
review within six weeks of the commencement of the implementation of the release
in question.

1.3.7

The final results are formally presented to Post Office Ltd. via CS/PER/046,
“Counter Transaction Performance — Measurement and Results”.

Regardless of whether the results of the benchmarking exercise have been
delivered, in the event that a Major Release is implemented and there is an obvious
degradation in performance in terms of transaction times and such degradation is
visible to the branch and reported to the Horizon System Helpdesk, the incident
identified by Fujitsu Services as causing the degradation will be resolved via the
established incident and problem management process. To the extent that any such
incident is caused directly by Fujitsu Services’ actions, the resolution of that
incident will be at Fujitsu Services’ cost.

1.4. Service Availability

1.4.1

1.4.2

1.4.3

The Transaction Benchmark Service shall be provided for every agreed Major
Release.

The rig exercise shall be scheduled in the release plan so that the data recording
part of the exercise is completed before implementation of the software release.

The Transaction Benchmark Service shall be provided upon request by Post Office
Ltd, (in a timescale to be agreed with Fujitsu Services) following the
implementation of an agreed change resulting from a Change Request or Customer
Work Package. Under such circumstances, the Transaction Benchmark Service
shall be chargeable.

Service Targets & Limits

There are no Service Level Targets or limits relating to the Transaction Benchmark
Service. For the avoidance of doubt, there are no Service Level Targets associated
with counter system component times.

There are system performance targets (Target Times) and these are stated in
Section 3.0.

The Target Times are subject to a 5% uplift with each Major Release to
accommodate the likely increase in system contention arising from increased
functionality and complexity inherent in the release.

The Target Times shall be changed whenever an agreed system change affects one
or more of the measured system components.

The Target Times may also be changed as the result of an agreement to change the
benchmarking method. Under such circumstances, credits gained under the
previous benchmarking method shall be carried forward in an equitable manner.

1.5.6 When, on completion of a benchmark evaluation, the counter system component
timings prove to be greater than the Target Times, this shall be deemed a
“Benchmark Time Discrepancy”.

1.5.7 In the event of Benchmark Time Discrepancy the following provisions shall apply:

1.5.7.1 The Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall agree (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld) a method of rectification, including a timetable, (a “
Rectification Plan”) for each Benchmark Time Discrepancy (which plan may
involve the agreement of an adjustment to the Target Times). If the
Rectification Plan requires changes to be made to the provisions of the
Agreement (including any CCD), such changes shall be made pursuant to the
Hard Change Control Procedure. Any changes to the Horizon Service
Infrastructure required to rectify a Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall be made
at no charge to the Post Office.

1.5.7.2 Each Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall not be a Default unless within 90 days
after the identification of that Benchmark Time Discrepancy the Parties have
failed to reach agreement upon a Rectification Plan and the Benchmark Time
Discrepancy has not been rectified by Fujitsu Services. In such a circumstance
that Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall become a Default upon expiry of that
90-day period.

1.5.7.3. A failure by Fujitsu Services to comply with a Rectification Plan shall be a Default.

1.5.7.4 This paragraph 1.5.7 shall be without prejudice to Post Office’s rights with respect
to release authorisation.

2.0 Benchmarking Method

2.1 Introduction
This section describes the method by which Fujitsu Services undertake benchmark
evaluation.
The Agreement, (ref. BP/CON/319, “Schedule 19: Operational Services”, effective as
of 1“ January 2003) introduces a new benchmarking philosophy whereby Fujitsu
Services are no longer responsible for measuring and reporting performance in terms
of end-to-end transactions.
Instead, performance is measured in terms of the system components only.
Then, for EPOSS, OBCS and APS, results are reported at individual system
component level and, for NBS, the system component times are aggregated and
reported by transaction type.
To reiterate, there is now no measurement or estimate made by Fujitsu Services of any
manual activity present within any of the transactions under scrutiny.
2.2 Scope
Counter performance is measured across the four counter services:
= APS
= OBCS
= EPOSS
= NBS
using a representative set of transaction types (see Table 1), executed on a
representative test rig.
Normal counter operation using best practice is assumed. In particular, fallback
scenarios are not considered.
With reference to Table 1, Post Office Ltd has accepted that the (system parts of the)
EPOSS process for selling a 2™ class stamp is the same as that for selling a 1“ class so
only one of the transaction types is scripted and executed during the benchmarking
data recording.
The same applies to: -
e POSS: Girobank Business Deposit - less than and more than £60
e EPOSS: National Savings - Deposit and Withdrawal
e APS: Magnetic Card Payments - with and without token

2.4.2.1

For NBS, only the aggregate of the system components for each transaction type is
reported.

The results are then compared against:
= the Target Time

= the results achieved in the previous benchmarking exercise.
Measurement Method

Data Capture

Each transaction type is decomposed into a series of clearly identifiable system events,
generally defining the start and end points of the system components of the
transaction. These events could be, for example, the receipt of data from a peripheral,
a screen change or output to the printer.

The sample transaction types for each service are executed on a test rig configured to
represent three types of counter; a single counter branch, the slave of a two-counter
branch and the gateway of a two-counter branch'. Each transaction is executed four
times on each counter configuration.

The process is recorded on videotape. The videotapes are then processed to expand
the time frame by 25, so that each frame lasting 0.04 seconds in real time lasts 1
second when replayed, and the time and frame count superimposed.

The event-to-event times are then read from the expanded video. The maximum
precision to which the event times can be read is 0.04 seconds.

NBS transactions are slightly different in that the authorisation part of the transaction,
though technically a system component, is outside of Fujitsu Service’s control, hence
responsibility. Further there is no visible evidence of exactly when the start and end
events (the Request and the Authorisation) occur. Instead the duration of this
component (the [R]-to-[A] time) is recorded as a system message that can be
downloaded after the data recording is completed.

Data Processing

The data recording exercise provides twelve values per system component per
transaction type. To reduce the risk of skewing the results, the best and worst values
for each system component are disregarded leaving ten values.

EPOSS, OBCS and APS

For EPOSS, OBCS and APS transaction types, the total sample size for each system
component is given by:

10*Nrr

where Nrris the number of Transaction Types using that system component.

" CS/TSC/003, “Benchmarking Scripts”, specifies the steps to be followed for each transaction and states the system events that form the start
and end of each system component.

3.1.1

The system component benchmark time is then calculated as the average of all those
samples. Appendix A: illustrates this point using a sample of data from the CSR+
results for OBCS.

NBS

For the NBS transaction types, the benchmark time is calculated as the sum of
averaged system components comprising each transaction type.

System Performance Targets

The change from transaction level reporting to system component level reporting
necessitated the generation of a new set of contractual targets.

For EPOSS, OBCS and APS services, the targets were calculated by extracting the
system component elements of the transaction target times used when benchmarking
CSR+ (amended, where necessary, to reflect product changes implemented since
CSR+).

For NBS, being a new type of service, completely new targets were generated using
data from a variety of sources. NBS targets were originally stated (as “initial” targets)
in BP/SPE/035, “NBS Definition”, and later ratified (as contractual targets) in
CS/PER/044, “NBS Benchmark Counter Transaction Times for Release BI3”.

All the targets are restated here for completeness.

EPOSS, OBCS and APS Targets

The calculation of the new, system component, Target Times comprised three stages:
= Carrying forward of any credit/debit achieved at CSR+ (at transaction type level)

= Addition of the credit/debit to the individual system component measurements
(within each transaction type) and averaging of the results at the system component
level within each product.

= Addition of a 5% uplift, to allow for increased system contention arising from the
increased functionality and complexity of the next software release’.

Carrying Forward Credit

In order to generate the new Target Times at System Component level, it was
necessary to carry forward any accumulated credits and debits gained under the
previous contract. This was achieved by dividing the credit/debit for the transaction
equitably among the system components according to how much the particular system
component contributed to the transaction time, relative to the other contributing
system components i.e.

Let Cr = Amount of credit gained at transaction level

? This is in accordance with a principle established in calculating target times for network banking
performance

3.1.2 Averaging
The calculation in section 3.1.1 was carried out for each of the system component
measurements selected under section 2.3. The results for each system component
were then averaged across all contributing transaction types.

3.1.3 Target Uplift
The results produced under section 3.1.2 were then uplifted by 5% to provide the new

4.0 Future Developments

Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd. shall keep the benchmarking activity under
review with a view to:

reducing the time required for each benchmarking activity

allowing a greater scope and/or increased focus of analysis

reducing costs

reducing the risk of errors occurring in the measurements

enabling easier integration of benchmarking into the release programme
making benchmarking business specific rather than sampled product specific
providing simplification in both processes and application

facilitating variable remuneration opportunities for the Post Office Ltd

integrating benchmarking with performance and sizing process

Such review may cover, for example, an investigation into the appropriateness and
usefulness of system diagnostic and other software-based testing and measurement
tools.

In calculating the system component benchmark time, the highest and lowest values in each set of twelve (shaded) are disregarded.

Then for each system component the average is taken from the remainder. For example, for the “Milk Tokens — 1” system component, the average of the
un-shaded values in the two indicated (<4) rows is calculated giving a value of 0.53 (to 2 decimal places).
