Hi Eddie
Thank you for your time to discuss the MCC Cash Withdrawal issue.

There are a couple of additional queries which we would appreciate your input on

4, When was the MCC rolled out and how long did it take between rollout and the error being spotted? MCC rolled
out on March 7" however, the Cash Withdrawal transaction didn’t roll out until 16!" March and the error was

spotted on 21% March.

2. Did any of the affected branches make good the apparent shortfall or were these all settled centrally? All settled

centrally

3. If any of the branches did make a payment to Post Office for the shortfall, have these funds been returned to the

branch? N/A

4. Were any communications sent to either ail of the branches or the affected branches to inform them of the
error. If so, please could you provide copies of these? No, this was a learning point for the project, I thought that
the Transaction Correction would contain full details of the error but this is apparently not the case and, when it

arrived, it generated a number of calls to FSC.

If it would be easier to discuss the above, please do not hesitate to call.

tomorrow morning and Transaction Corrections should be with the 36 branches that carried out a transaction by the
end of the week. In total forty transactions were carried out worth £5,328.

Hi Andy,

Will you ring me? Anytime’ s fine,

Nick forwarded on your email below. Given the issues with Sparrow, it would be helpful for us to understand this
problem and see whether it could be raised by affected postmasters. To that end, would you mind speaking to Andy
Parsons at Bond Dickinson (copied) so that he is fully aware of the background — just in case?

Many thanks,

Hi All,

As promised a quick update on the current situation with the issue detailed below.

As of this morning it looks as though this has affected 34 transactions so far. A fix has been tested and has been
successful and will be rolled out tomorrow. Main priorities now are finding out whether or not this has affected
settlement with FRES and getting transaction corrections sent to any branch that has carried out a withdrawal.

This incident will form part of the ‘lessons learned’ of the project but it’s worth mentioning that although this was part
of the overall deployment of the new card, Cash Withdrawals over the counter is an existing transaction for all Partner
Banks so it’s unclear at the moment why this implementation wasn’t rolled out correctly as BAU.

Till let you know tomorrow if the Fix has been deployed successfully.

Hi All,

I need to make you make you aware of a serious issue with MCC. As you can see from the e-mails below and from the
attached Screenshot, Multi-Currency Card withdrawals over the counter are being treated as deposits by Horizon. This
means that every branch that has carried out a Cash Withdrawal for a customer will now have double the amount as a
loss. Early indications are that customer's cards are not affected and are showing the transactions as withdrawals. It
appears that there’s a problem with the Ref Data on the Horizon side of things.

A fix is currently being tested and rolled out tomorrow so I’m currently investigating whether FRES can ‘block’ these
transactions from their end for today.

As soon as I know more I'll let you know.

James has checked the ref data system and it is treating a withdrawal as a ‘take from Customer’ deposit!
Erika is discussing with the team a fix and when it will be deployed.

Will update you shortly.

@ Erika, can you update all on the email re the fix

We have just checked with the Brentford branch (used by Paul Moss a few days back for his live Balance Redemption
test), they also have the same problem.

So there is something not quite right with the way that this type of transaction is being identified and applied to branch
balance sheets

Hi Eddie

As just discussed this afternoon.

Please see attached an example of a MCC Cash Withdrawal processed in branch, I believe this is showing as a credit
instead of a debit, therefore showing as though the card has been topped up.

We believe that the customer has advised that their MCC has been debited.

But I also think that the vendor is showing incorrectly too, please attached a cut from the vendor showing a card top up
the same as a cash withdrawal, so that would appear that we may have settled incorrectly?

Checked with the branch that has completed the cash withdrawal today, and they did complete transaction as a chip
and pin.
