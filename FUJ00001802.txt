1.2.1 On-site replacement of faulty equipment;

1.2.2 Repair and recycling of faulty equipment;

1.2.3 Hardware asset tracking;

1.2.4 Local Area Network support;

1.2.5 Portable Appliance Testing

1.2.6 Transaction recovery as a result of communications outages

2.0 Service Principles

2.1 General

2.1.1 Support Engineers will use reasonable endeavours to minimise disruption to the
Post Office Branch

2.1.2 Support Engineers will be appropriately trained to carry out the service

2.1.3 Maintenance and repair of the elements of Horizon Service Infrastructure involving

3.1.1

3.1.4

Fujitsu Services shall carry out visits for maintenance or repair in line with the
Service Levels described in Schedule 15. Optionally, a Branch Manager shall elect
to defer a visit to a more convenient time. For example, in a larger Branch, if a
fault occurs at the busiest time of day then Post Office may specify the start time
from which Fujitsu Services may carry out the maintenance or repair. In these
circumstances, the request for service shall be diagnosed fully but not carried out
until the preferred appointment time. In this case the time in suspension shall not
count towards downtime as defined in Schedule 15.

Incidents related to the Wide Area Network (WAN) once identified are managed
by the Data Centre Operations Service as defined within the CCD entitled “Data
Centre Operations Service” (CS/SER/007).

Service Definition

On-site replacement / repair of faulty equipment

Upon determining that a fault has occurred, the Post Office Branch will contact the
HSH, providing as much detail concerning the nature of the fault as possible.

Where appropriate the HSH will complete diagnostic checks to attempt to resolve
the fault prior to committing a Support Engineer to attend the Post Office Branch.
The Post Office Branch will be asked to participate in this diagnostic check where
possible.

If the fault cannot be cleared and service cannot be restored following the initial
diagnostic checks, the HSH will obtain detail of the access times to the Post Office
Branch, which are not necessarily linked to Post Office Branch opening times, and
a visit by a Support Engineer will be scheduled in accordance with the severity of
the incident (Priority A or Priority B) and the location of the Branch (Local,
Intermediate or Remote). Definitions of Priority and Local, Intermediate or
Remote locations are set out in Schedule 15.

Prior to their first visit to a Post Office Branch, Support Engineers will undergo
security validation by Post Office

Support Engineers visiting Post Office Branches to repair faults will provide proof
of identity to the Branch Manager or representative.

The Support Engineer will carry service exchange hardware components and will
be appropriately trained in the fitting of such components.

Fujitsu Services will record all serialised assets listed in paragraph 3.3.1 of this
document and the exchange of serial numbers as a result of service visits.

Not withstanding the above sections 3.3.1 to 3.3.2 inclusive, Fujitsu Services will
exercise control over all equipment including component parts held by them on
behalf of the Post Office, at a level appropriate for the ongoing provision of the
Service.

Local Area Network support

Fujitsu Services may choose to sub contract the maintenance of the LAN cabling to
a third party as appropriate.

Portable appliance testing

The service provides for one Portable Appliance Test (PAT) to include the
inspection, test and labelling of each item of electrical equipment, in situ within
each Post Office Branch over a period of 3 years commencing January 2004. To
provide the service, Fujitsu Services will complete the following activities:

a. Conduct a visual inspection of all Fujitsu Services installed equipment and
mains cords within the Post Office Branch.

b. Test systems within the Post Office Branch using the appropriate tools and test
equipment. The testing of each item shall be undertaken by application of the
relevant test procedure.

c. The attachment of a colour coded sticky label to each item inspected and tested
to indicate success (of the inspection and relevant test) or failure.

d. To replace faulty detachable mains cords, incorrect value fuses and damaged
plugs.
e. To re-terminate plugs where necessary.

f. To render inoperative, any electrical item which fails the inspection and test
and brings this to the attention of the customer and arranges for its
replacement.

g. To record test results against a unique identifier for each item.

Once these activities have been completed, Fujitsu Services will provide the Branch
Manager with the test results. Test results for each Post Office Branch will also be

made available to Post Office within one month of the test being completed at that
Post Office Branch and will be maintained in a Fujitsu Services database.

3.5.3 The service is delivered during normal office hours, however Fujitsu Services may
agree to provide the service outside those hours on request. The schedule for
safety test visits will be agreed in advance with Branch Managers and Post Office.

3.5.4 All remedial maintenance work carried out on site will comply with the standards
prescribed and will ensure that the requirements of the Electricity At Work
Regulations 1989 continue to be met upon return to service.

3.5.5 For the avoidance of doubt, PAT is not covered by any SLT described within
section 5.1.1, nor shall PAT visits count to the monthly limit on engineer visits.

3.6 Transaction Recovery

3.6.1 When the ISDN line is not available at a Branch or a Fujitsu Services Support
Engineer (or other suitably qualified person authorised by Fujitsu Services) will
visit that Branch (a “Recovery Visit”) and connect the working gateway PC with
the data centre via an ISDN emulator, a Support Engineers laptop (configured to
communicate with the data centre via PSTN), and the Branch’s existing PSTN line.

3.6.2 Connection with a data centre will be achieved using the ISDN emulator in such a
way that the Branch gateway PC communicates with that data centre as if it was
using an ISDN line. Such connection shall be achieved using a free phone
telephone number.

3.6.3 Once communication has been established between a Branch anda data centre (via
ISDN emulator, laptop and PSTN line) normal two-way Riposte message
replication will occur. This will result in both delivery of Transaction data to the
data centre and delivery of Reference Data changes and OBCS Stop List changes
to the Branch.

3.6.4 The connection between a Branch and the data centre using the ISDN emulator
and its subsequent disconnection after successful transmission of messages to and
from the data centre shall be carried out such that if the ISDN line is restored
before Fujitsu Services arranges another Recovery Visit to that Branch (in
accordance with paragraph 3.6.5 below) normal service to that Branch using the
ISDN line will resume.

3.6.5 Connection between a Branch and a data centre via ISDN emulator, laptop and
PSTN line (as described in paragraph 3.6.1 above) will only be applied if that
Branch has a PSTN line and a a standard telephone socket that the Support
Engineer is allowed access to.

3.6.6 Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to arrange and undertake each
Recovery Visit (in order to carry out the activities described in paragraphs 3.6.1 to
3.6.4) on or before the eighth working day that an ISDN line is not available, and
at intervals of not more than two working days after until the ISDN circuit is
restored. Each Recovery Visit shall be arranged by prior agreement with the
Branch in question (which may be on the same day as such visit ) to commence
with the Post Office Core Day, of if thee hours that Branch would normally be
open for business extend beyond the Post Office Core Day, within that longer
period or at such other time as Fujitsu Services and the Branch may agree. In
making that arrangement with the Branch, if the Recovery Visit might reasonably
be expected to extend beyond the time that Fujitsu Services is aware that Branch
would normally close for business, Fujitsu Services shall inform that Branch. The
period of access to a Branch for each Recovery Visit shall be that which is
reasonably required for that visit to be successfully completed.

3.6.7 The Support Engincer will visit the Branch to ensure all transactions are collected
and distributed to Post Office Clients by ‘Day J’ as referred to in the SLT’s
documented within section 5.1.1.

3.6.8 The detailed procedures for arranging and executing Recovery Visits are described
in the CCD entitled “Process for Laptop Data Retrieval” (CS/PRD/105).

3.6.9 Fujitsu Services shall ensure that an appropriate solution to allow Recovery Visits
in respect of ADSL connected Branches be developed by the date set out in row
28 of Schedule 12 for the implementation of ADSL in Branches. ADSL Recovery
Visits shall be in accordance with the same procedures and criteria detailed in
paragraphs 3.6.1 to 3.6.7.
