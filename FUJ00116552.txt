impact on the project and lifetime P&L (£9.9m margin — worst case).

Fujitsu have started negotiation with POL to allow the program to continue and
avoid dispute.
Since last review £4.3m contingency has been added and £1.5m of additional
contingency will be funded by the customer, bringing the total contingency to £5.8m.
