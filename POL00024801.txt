Remote Access wording - subject to litigation privilege [BD-4A.FID26859284]

Attachments: _DOC_33442637(1)_Remote Access Rider v3.DOCX

All

Please find attached the proposed wording on the remote access issue — for discussion on our call at 6pm today.

Three points to bear in mind when reviewing:

1.

In light of comments yesterday, we've provided a slightly longer explanation so to hopefully present this issue in a
better light.

Tony agrees with the current wording but has reiterated the importance of dealing with this point candidly, even if
that does cause some short-term pain.

We do not yet have a 100% clear picture on some of the technical and operation issues on this topic. We
therefore need to be careful not to overstate our case. This draft wording will also need to be run past Deloitte /
FJ.

Kind regards

Andy
