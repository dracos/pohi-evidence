Dear Mr Chester,

As you are aware, I have been a Sub-Postmaster for 18 years and prior to the 1-horizon Computer
system, I enjoyed a satisfactory post office business. For some considerable years I have been
accused of wrongful accounting. Over the last 15 months alone, February 2012 - May 2013, more
than £39,000 is deemed to be my shortfall, an average of £600 per week. This surely cannot be
correct, but the notifications from the Post office state this is the case.

The worry has affected I GRO               and plans for retirement have had to be postponed. I have not
had a break in my business        foi,'-i-rrore than four years, to keep a tight rein on the office. The
                            Tioiii=s




financial strain on myself and my family is devastating and continues on a daily basis.

Orr the advice of Mr Alan Bates from the JFSA, I have been advised to contact my local M.P.
regarding the recent media coverage on the BBC news and in the Telegraph, regarding the
investigation into the errors discovered in the Post Office's horizon. Computer system.
1 believe the POI-. has a board meeting next week afler all the media coverage, and would like my
particular case to be considered along with the many others in a similar situation.

Yours sincerely,

         G RO
Martin K Griffiths
