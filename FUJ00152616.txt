Diane,
| thought I'd keep you updated:

I've now booked to go away on holiday from 16th to 23rd September
(returning about midnight Saturday night) so any preparation will need
to take place before Friday 15th or on Sunday 24th (preferably the
former!)

I'm prepared to travel up to Caernarfon on Sunday 24th, but will clearly
need final confirmation as to whether it is still "on" that Sunday. |

can check emails on the Sunday, or will pick up voicemails on my mobile.
I'll also need guidance as to whether or not to make hotel bookings in
Caernarfon before | go on my holiday.

Regards

Gareth

Hi Gareth,

Thanks for that. It would have meant proving to the courts that your
holiday was booked prior to the date being set as they can be very
awkward.

Anyway, we are still hopeful that it will be resolved prior to the trial
but we have to plan it as if it will go ahead.

All witness's will have to be present on the 1st day unless the defence
has

agreed there statement and dont wish to ask any questions about that
evidence. It is pretty much as you see on the TV really but remember
that

you will have sight of your statement prior to taking the stand and can
only be asked questions specifically about your statement.

A lot can happen between now and Sept 25th as Mr Thomas defence are
still
asking a lot of questions so we will wait with anticipation.

| will keep you informed and many thanks for your flexibility, it is

very
much appreciated

Diane,

| discussed this wit!
that

the last two weeks in September was the best time to go away on holiday,
but
since |_
arrange

some other time.

H then we'll try and

| understand also that the trial is in Caernarfon. Do you have any idea
to how much time will be involved and what exactly is required? I've
been to court in any capacity and my knowledge of such things is based
films and TV (which I'm sure are inaccurate!)

Regards

Gareth

Thanks for that Gareth.

On your e mail you said you were planning a couple of weeks off in
September but nothing booked. As i have not heard any different the
dates

have not been blocked off.

Please could you let me know if you have now booked leave for week
beginning 25th Sept as i will have to get the criminal law team to go
back

to court for another date

Thanks
