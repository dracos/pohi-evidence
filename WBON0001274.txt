Hi Paul

Thank you for getting to this so quickly.

Please find attached your finalised witness statement and exhibit for your sign off. I also attached a pdf document
which show the final changes (which is namely inserting document reference numbers so that the barrister can easily
identify the documents at trial).

I appreciate you are soon leaving the office for annual leave and whilst it is likely we will get extra time to file your
statement, I thought it best if you could sign it in its current form before you leave today, and if we get the extension we
‘can make any final changes.

You have been nominated as someone with knowledge of about the area identified in your statement. The witness
statement which will be a material factor in defending the claim. It sets out what factually happened on the ground
during the relevant time. Your evidence is therefore very important and you need to be comfortable that what you are
saying is accurate.

The purpose of the witness statement is to provide written evidence to support a party's case that will be used as
evidence in Court. The statement is a crucial part of the case, designed to show it in its strongest light.

Statement of truth

‘witness statement must have a “statement of truth’. This is a statement confirming that the person making it believes
that the facts stated in the document are true. When you are signing the statement of truth, you are confirming that the
facts contained within the statement are true to the best of your knowledge.

There are severe penalties for signing a statement of truth without an honest belief in the truth of the facts being
verified (including imprisonment for up to two years for being in contempt of court),

Where you do not have first-hand knowledge of facts and matters which are set out in the witness statement, you
should carry out sufficient investigation to satisfy yourself of the truth of the matters stated.

Next steps

Please could you carry out a final review of the statement and sign and date the same with today's date? Please then
return the same to me as a pdf and if possible before you go on holiday, send the original to me by post.

Hi Paul

Due to the circumstances}, } we may be able to get more time to finalise your witness statement, as on
review by my colleague there is another individual claimant (Bates) which it would be helpful to get your thoughts on.
When are you back from annual leave please?

Iwill need to double check that we can push the deadline with the powers that be.

Kind regards

Hi Mandy

I’ve just realised that page one says “witness statement of Paul F Williams”

I do not have a middle name - the is an email convention added to distinguish me from another Paul

Williams who also does not have a middle initial — so for accuracy it should be the “witness statement of

Paul Williams”
