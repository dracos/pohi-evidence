In the Crown Court at Norwich

Regina v Alison Henderson

ADVICE ON EVIDENCE

I have settled the indictment with the dates for the whole of the employment. I have added a false
accounting [multi-offence count] to cover the whole period as well. This looks like a straight forward
case, since D is the only one who normally works in the office. Some further information would be

helpful:

1. Can we have the exact date when employment started? Did D have prior experience in
working in a PO before this contract as a SPM?

2. Do we have the daily cash in hand figures? Do we still have ONCHs? If D has been making
the daily declaration, it must have been even more obvious that cash was adrift.

3. Was the office ever audited before? If so, we can narrow our offence period.

4. When D's daughter worked as relief for holidays, did she have a different log on? We may
have to narrow the offence period, if the cash was correct when the daughter was left in
charge. When was the last time the daughter was working in the PO? Obviously the

daughter may have known about the shortages, but kept quiet about them.
