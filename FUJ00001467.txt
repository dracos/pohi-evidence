5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This section lists the identifier of each Acceptance Criterion that will be
demonstrated by the Acceptance Test. It also lists the Acceptance Test
Conditions that are used to determine whether (or not) the Acceptance Criterion
has been met together with the applicable test Phase, Technical Test, or Live
Trial.

Acceptance Criteria are split into three sets of tables according to the nature of
the acceptance method, one set for those tested by Acceptance Trial, a second
for those tested by Acceptance Review and a third which lists those criteria which
are for Acceptance at a later release. The Release on which Acceptance is to be
conducted is defined by reference to the Release Contents Description included
in the Associated Documents section of the Acceptance Specification.
Exceptionally, it may be necessary for one particular Acceptance Criterion to be
tested by a combination of trial and review in which case there are entries for
Trial and Review.

5.1 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND TEST CONDITIONS

Conformance of the Service Levels Acceptance Criteria will be demonstrated
through Acceptance Trials and/or Acceptance Reviews.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Trials comprise practical tests using prepared
test scripts. If applicable the Test Condition(s) appropriate to a criterion are
specified in section 5.1.1 together with a description of the test. Detailed
composition of the test in terms of sequences of Test Conditions is contained in
Section 10. In the tables in section 5.1.1 the rows labelled Function Run Entry
will be populated immediately prior to the running of the Acceptance Trials ina
working version of the Acceptance Specification. These will provide invigilators
with references to the checklists used to monitor the progress of the testing. The
order of running of Test Conditions will not necessarily correspond to the order
presented in HLTPs because of the “physicalisation” of the testing. The Function
Run Entry will allow the invigilator to read across from the criterion to the
checklist.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Review comprise typically document reviews,

5.1.2 Description of tests conducted by Acceptance Review

The table below shows which Acceptance criteria are to be met by Acceptance
Review. Acceptance Tests will use the versions of any relevant documents (as
referenced from section 0.2) contained in the approved version of the
Acceptance Specification.

Requirement Id SL
Criterion 1
Derivation Letter from Pat Kelsey 23/7/97

Criterion Description I The above letter states:

“The Authorities need to be assured that service level
monitoring procedures accurately reflect the delivered
service levels, and that the Services have the capability
of achieving the agreed service levels at the data
volumes predicted for steady state operation.”

Note: The presence of this criterion also facilitates the
use of the numbering of criteria and subcriteria in (15)
unchanged.

Test Condition The objectives of (15) are directed at this criterion, viz.:
“The primary aim is to assure that the ICL Pathway
Release 2 services will support the daily projected
workload within the time available, and if not, to identify
the performance constraints and service capability at
various points into full roll-out.

The secondary aim is to yield measurement data which
will be used to populate, calibrate and enhance the
quality & coverage of the performance models. These
will be used to predict the capability of the system to
support the ‘steady state’ workload. The model is an on-
going activity as new services & functionality are
introduced and as designs are enhanced to meet the
business needs.”

Method This criterion will be met through the tests performed as
part of (15). The satisfactory performance of the tests
themselves is the first step in meeting this criterion:
there has also to be analysis and assessment of the
associated test reports; in turn these may indicate the
need for modifications to aspects of the systems under
test, retest, and further analysis and assessment.

6. ACCEPTANCE INCIDENT SEVERITY

This section identifies the guidelines to be applied during the analysis of
Acceptance Incidents, in order to establish the severity of such Acceptance
Incidents.

6.1 HIGH SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a substantive impact
on the service received by the Customer, e.g. failure to pay benefits to the right
person, at the right place, at the right time.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a major impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where
there was a major impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES
necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. failure to support
accurate POCL accounting.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the
service where there is no acceptable procedural workaround.

Consistent failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels,
e.g. where particular transactions do not meet the minimum Acceptable
Threshold under normal loading.

6.2 MEDIUM SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is visible to the Customer and is
likely to give rise to an adverse public perception of the service, but does not
substantively impact the service received by the Customer, e.g. incorrect spelling

on a receipt.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a medium impact on
the ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or
where there was a medium impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or
AUTHORITIES necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-
production of a weekly report, resulting in its manual transcription, which causes
additional resource or effort at every outlet of the average duration of one hour
per week per outlet.

Occasional failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels,
e.g. at peak loading, some transactions fail to meet Minimum Acceptable
Thresholds, but on average all transactions within the service do achieve
Minimum Acceptable Thresholds.

6.3 LOW SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion that is neither visible to nor has
substantive impact on the service received by the Customer e.g. presentational,
style and other cosmetic faults that are only visible to the user.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a minor impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where
there was a minor impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES
necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-production of a
weekly report, resulting in its manual transcription, which causes additional
resource or effort at ten or fewer outlets of the average duration of one hour per
week per outlet.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the
service but where the workaround is as secure as the original solution (i.e. the
only impact on risk is in ensuring that the workaround is performed, but where
procedures have been agreed and are in place)
