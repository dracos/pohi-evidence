On the 15" May at 11.00hrs, there is a Board Group Litigation Order Sub Committee meeting,
of which you are a member, together with Ken McCall and Tom Cooper. Ken is out of the
Country so I knew that he was not available, but as you and Tom were attending, we had two
Board members in attendance.

have tried to move this to the afternoon as you have requested, but Tom, Paula and Al are not
available. The difficulty is that we have timed this meeting because of the merits opinion being
issued on the 30" April and needing the Sub Committee and briefing for UKGI before Board on
the 24" May.

Is there any flexibility your end to allow you to dial in to the meeting?
Vil await to hear back from you.

Kind regards

Di

Hi Di,

The only change I can see we need to make is that I will be around on the afternoon, not the
morning of 15th May, so please push meetings forwards. I can’t see a problem with the
following week when the Board meeting is on 24th.

I will look at June and July.

Hello Di,

I will get back to you around future arrangements, but I don’t expect to be firmly committed to a
Tuesday afternoon every week.

Hi Tim

I didn’t really get a chance to speak to you today, but I just wondered in your new role as
Chairman of HMCTS if you will have a PA in that role, that I will need to liaise with?

I understand that your commitment with them will be primarily on a Tuesday afternoon — is this
correct? If so, I just wanted to check that all the Boards and Committees that we already have
scheduled in the diary on a Tuesday for 2018 & 2019 will stay as they are?
