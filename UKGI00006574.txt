Richard, Justin, Patrick

Draft advice for the Minister attached — I would welcome any comments. The letter in from Tim Parker is also
attached.

I am trying to strike the balance between reassuring the Minister that no further action is required, while not
appearing blasé, particularly given her known nervousness about this matter. Your views very welcome!

I have tried to contact her office for a box deadline extension but not managed to get through — but I would rather
delay sending this than send without comments. If you could look at it this afternoon, that would be super helpful.

Thanks
Laura

Hi Laura,
I put a hard copy of the letter in BNR’s weekend box and she had the following comments:

“I would like officials to advise on a reply / the need for a meeting. I would also like advice on when I should brief the
Secretary of State. It’s not definitive as I see it.

Kind regards

Sophie, Andrew
Please see attached letter for Baroness Neville-Rolfe from Post Office Chair Tim Parker regarding his investigation into
the Horizon system. Please note that this letter is confidential and subject to legal professional privilege so please do

not circulate further.

I believe this was sent to your office directly on Friday, but forwarding in case it went in hard copy only. Would you
like a short covering submission from officials to go with the letter?

Thanks
Laura
