2. MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

GENERAL
Programme Status Operational Counters
31* October 1999 3558
Comments

There was a significant increase in the volume of calls logged by Live Outlets during October.
This increase is in part due to the rollout of new Offices, but the ratio of calls per Outlet has also
increased. The largest category of logged calls was Advice and Guidance, as this accounted for
56% of calls.

The main contributory factors to the increased volume of A&G calls are as follows: -

« As expected, there was an increase in the number of cash account procedural calls, due to the
rollout of new Offices and the unfamiliarity with the system.

On 1 October, there was a Reference Data problem which affected ‘Rem in / Rem out' and
‘Transfers’. This generated at least 640 A&G calls,

¢ Towards the end of the month, there was a revaluation of stamps, and this caused additional
enquiry calls to be logged.

The increased volume of calls due to the Reference Data problem and the revaluation of stamps,
compounded by the failure of Powerhelp for 2hrs on 27"" October, impacted upon the call
answering SLAs for the month.

Performance Summary
The actual achievement of calls answered within 20
seconds was 74.5% in October, therefore the Minimum
Acceptable Threshold was not met.

Similarly, the calls answered within 40 seconds did not
meet the required level, as the actual performance was

79-7%.

The percentage of abandoned calls increased in
October, and consequently the MAT was not achieved,
as the actual performance was 85.6%.

Cause

These SLAs were not achieved due to the increased
volume of calls received as a result of the Reference
Data problem, and also due to the failure of Powerhelp
at the end of the month,

The failure of Powerhelp for 2hrs on 27/10/99, meant
that manual procedures were invoked to log calls
during this time. Once Powerhelp became available
again, it took shr 5omins to input the calls which had
been logged manually.

Action
Powerhelp failover procedures are being reviewed.

The required level of priority A calls resolved within
4hrs and 6hrs was not achieved in the month of
October, as the results were 75.0% and 87.5%
respectively.

Cause

These SLAs were not achieved because one call was
resolved in more than ghrs and another call was
resolved in more than 6hrs.

The low volumes of such calls cause the percentage of
failure to appear significant.

Action
None

Performance Summary
The achievement of priority B calls resolved within

8hrs and 1ohrs did not meet the MAT in October, as
the results were 86.4% and 89.4% respectively.

Although this is an improvement on September, the
required level was still not met.

Cause

At the beginning of the month, some calls were being
held at 1 and 2"! line support for too long, and this
caused the SLA targets to be missed.

APS File Delivery ~ Day D

Performance Summary
The achievement for APS file delivery (by Day B and

Day D) was 96.3% and 99.0% respectively, therefore
they did not quite meet the MAT.

Cause
These SLAs were not achieved in October due to the
high number of non-polled Outlets (particularly on
Mondays), There have been some genuine failures
including the loss of ISDN, but there is still a problem
with counters being powered off at weekends.

Action

the causes of non-polled offices.
