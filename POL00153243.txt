as refer to how they were contacted last Friday.

Tassume (but pls shout if wrong!) that your team will be sending out since you spoke to them late last week ?
Many thanks

Importance: High

Jane - thanks.

As it happens, the tweak which I felt necessary to reflect the terms of the EDM were not difficult to accommodate and, as such, my
further changes are modest in number and extent.

Here is, then, the final version subject to the approval of this copy list (which would be great to have as soon as poss).

Once that is done, what is the plan, please, for communicating it to relevant MPs (noting that each will be slightly different
depending on whether we spoke/emailed/voicemailed them on Friday ?

Best wishes

Patrick

Thanks Mark - I have reflected all of your amends in the attached.

Is everyone else happy? If so, we can start getting this letter out on Monday. Patrick deserves the credit as I have pretty much lifted
his letter to Iain Wright in its entirety.

All

First of all: Mark, thank you for this: excellent.

only have a few comments:

- Lagree about using the ref to the mediation scheme (your 3 paras at top)

- in next para try to get "despite this being detrimental to our position" in the para

- suggest we lose the third para of the criminal cases section: about "do not believe inquiry appropriate": I want to avoid idea we are
's "not a question for us to rule on but..." should be public line

"resisting" an inquiry - it's
Similarly would lose the third sentence of the next para beginning "no detail has been given..."
That's all from me.
