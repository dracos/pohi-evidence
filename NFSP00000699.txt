Hi George — Cobb PR have taken a call from BBC Radio 4's You and Yours about the “forthcoming”
report on the Horizon mediation scheme set up by POL. They want us to supply them with details of
affected subpostmasters, for them to interview (and Angela Gallen has gone back to them to advise that
we're unable to help on this).

Shall I go to POL to seek further info on the schedule and likely content for the report?
I wonder if we need to put together a reactive line for the media, and possibly the website and magazine?
For info, this is the reactive press statement we used last summer, when the scheme was announced:

“The NFSP welcomes the establishment of this scheme by Post Office Ltd. We trust that current and
former subpostmasters who genuinely believe that claims against them are unfounded will take this
opportunity and any financial assistance which goes with it, to seek a resolution to these cases. We are
also reassured that POL has agreed to act on the need for improved training and support on Horizon for
subpostmasters.”

Thanks
