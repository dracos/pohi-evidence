Paula just to let you know I have already been in touch with Janet and we have organised for her to send
the list of offices she has so far over to me today. 2nd Sight are also contacting justice for
subpostmasters to get their ‘best' cases.

Thanks Alwen

Dear James, no problem at all.

Theresa has been in touch with Janet and we have agreed that you should send any case details to our
Company Secretary's office. Alwen will then be sure we liaise and track them all properly.

1am on holiday for two weeks from Friday, but Alwen and Theresa are here if there are any queries. And
if we don't speak, I hope you have a good summer. Thank you again for your leadership on this.

Best wishes,
Paula

Dear Paula,

Thank you for agreeing to this. I am very pleased, and will let the other MPs and
Mr Bates know.

I wonder if you might advise what I ought to do with case details that are being
forwarded to me from other MPs? I think we agreed that I can simply pass the
details on to your office, and it would be helpful if I could begin doing so, as it
will enable me to let the MPs know that their constituent's details have been

POL-0096400

forwarded to the right place. Can you let me know please to whom these might
be best directed?

Many thanks indeed.
Yours ever,

James

Subject: PRINTED SubPostmasters and 2nd Sight

Dear Paula,

I have just completed a very good meeting with Ron and Ian from 2"¢ Sight, and
Alan Bates from the Justice for SubPostmasters Alliance. Mr Bates was
accompanied by a forensic accountant, Miss Kay Linnell. Both asked some
challenging questions of Ron and Ian, which they answered to Mr Bates' and
Miss Linnell's satisfaction.

However the other MPs and I take the view - which I think you share - that so
far as we can we should ensure that as the investigation goes on it retains the

POL-0096400
buy-in of the sub-Postmasters. To this end I should be grateful if you would
agree to setting aside a small amount of money (capped at £5,000) for a forensic
accountant nominated by the Alliance (likely to be Miss Linnell) to carry out
sporadic review of 2° Sight's findings. We discussed this at the meeting, and
felt it would be the key to the entire process working for everyone - my
constituents and those of other MPs, the SubPostmasters, and of course the Post
Office and its reputation.

I should be most interested to hear your thoughts.
Yours ever

James
