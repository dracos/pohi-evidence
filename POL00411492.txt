I Change to FCA supervisory approach

FCA now supervises over 70,000 firms — Up from
26,000 it regulated at launch

It believes it now needs to take a different approach to
regulating such a large and diverse range of firms
(particularly it notes with resourcing levels remaining
largely fixed)

So supervision will now place more focus on:
- Prioritising issues identified in a strategic way

- Change intelligence and data analysis processes to
form a more consistent and collective view of key
markets and sectors

- Sectoral and market-wide analysis

" Some key challenges

Lack of sustained focus on culture and pragmatic action from boards

Forming and sustaining a culture is a constant process requiring commitment, perseverance, and continuous focus and monitoring by the board and
management. Despite increasing regulatory focus, boards have lacked a sustained focus

Accountability

Many organisations cite accountability as one of their key challenges. Layers of governance have slowed down decision making, added
bureaucracy and removed personal responsibility when things go wrong

Competing and conflicting frameworks

There are often multiple and competing frameworks which can mean the expectations about behaviour are not clear or easy to
follow e.g. ethics, values, leadership standards, code conduct, behavioural competency models

Blocking in the middle

Although ‘tone from the top” has improved, there is a perceived ‘muddle in the middle’ which is impacting the ‘echo from the bottom’
and preventing alignment of behaviour through the organisation

Emphasis on negative reinforcement and consequences

Approaches that solely seek to monitor and catch ‘bad apples’ lack appreciation of positive reinforcement. Ultimately this can drive a ‘big brother’ or ‘fear’
culture. There should be a balance of both carrot and stick

Initial industry response to conduct agenda

Since the FCA published their ‘Journey to the FCA’ paper (October 2012) and the regulator was launched (April 2013), firms, stimulated by early Risk Mitigation
Programme (RMP) requirements, made progress in establishing their conduct risk governance arrangements and frameworks. Whilst firms have varying
methods and timeframes to embed conduct risk, they have generally used the following steps:

2012

2013

2014

2015

1.

Conduct risk understanding and awareness ~ Initially by senior executives and than cascaded down to mid -management and front line staff
(e.g. town halls).

Tone at the Top ~ Management reaffirmed ‘Corporate Values’ or created new ‘Values’.

Identification of key risks — Firms started to identify key conduct risks. These were included in a new Conduct Risk Assessment or linked to existing
frameworks; e.g. operational risk frameworks, compliance risk assessments, management of conflicts, financial crime tools. The FCA’s response was to
remind firms that this was not a compliance exercise and that it needed to be owned by the business.

Governance (high-level) — Firms established high-level conduct risk roles (e.g. Head of Conduct Risk) and governance forums (e.g. Conduct Risk
Committees) to oversee conduct risks. These governance arrangements often helped firms establish the steps they needed to und ertake to focus on
conduct; e.g. some firms drafted conduct risk policies and set up new product approval committees.

Conduct Risk Frameworks and Monitoring - Firms started designing frameworks to capture and measure the conduct risk applicable to the
business. Similarly to compliance risks, conduct risk frameworks typically recorded the impact/likelihood of a conduct risk o ecurring and the control
and design effectiveness of controls in place to mitigate conduct risks.

Culture ~ Firms are considering whether the impact of their culture is driving conduct and customer outcomes. Some firms have performed a review of
their culture and identified ‘positive rein forcers' and cultural traits to focus on.

+ Firms have had mixed experiences in improving their identification, monitoring and managing conduct ri

+ Many firms have self-identified weaknesses to their conduct framework and are taking additional steps.
+ FCA recognises further work is required and have provided additional guidance on their expectations — 5 new conduct question asked of firms.

How do you identify the conduct risks inherent within your business?

Who is responsible for managing the conduct of your business?

What support mechanisms do you have to enable people to improve the conduct of
their business or function?

How do the board and executive committees gain oversight of the conduct of
the organisation?

Do you have any perverse incentives or other activities that may undermine any
strategies put in place to answer the first four questions?
