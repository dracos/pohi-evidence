AG3.60 I Decision I Acceptance position.

DC confirmed that there are no outstanding
High Severity Acceptance Incidents, and that all
other thresholds are within tolerance for
Acceptance Gateway 3.

Discussion ensued over the relevance to formal
acceptance of the outstanding assurances for
Service Delivery. It was agreed that these are
more relevant to the ongoing release
authorisation decisions, and therefore do not
preclude passing through AG3.

However it was agreed that the high priority
fixes in “Reset 4” — to be delivered as part of
Maintenance Release 01.08 — could constitute a
High Severity Al if not delivered in time for the
High Volume Pilot (over 272 branches).

As such, “Qualified Acceptance” at AG3 was
agreed, subject to the successful delivery of the
high priority items in Reset 04 (see.
AG3.61below for assessment of “high priority”
items).

Whilst not an exact match, this is closest to
Acceptance Board Recommendation 3:
“Proceed at risk through Acceptance
Gateway”.

over the optimal timing and volume of
branches to migrate each day during the
Medium Volume pilot.

It has been agreed to target Thursday
28" January for the first 10 branches,
with the remaining schedule under
discussion, but expected to be along the
following lines:-

o Thursday 28/01 — 10 branches.
This is expected to allow the critical
fixes for the implementation issues to
be fixed (see AG3.64 below)

o Friday 29/01 to Sunday 31/01 — No

o Mon 01 Feb — 20 branches

risk and required timescales for fix

A number of POL-impacting issues have
occurred during the pilot, mostly during
the implementation process itself. To
ease the migration process, many of
these need to be fixed before any further
migrations can take place — while others
are more manageable.

These were therefore assessed in turn
for their “required by” dates using the
above migration profile.

This position is summarised in the table

DECISION.

Based on the balance of the above
items, it was agreed that — subject to
progress against AG3.64, AG3.66 and
AG3.67 — the pilot should extend to the
next 10 branches on 28" January.
Acheckpoint meeting will be held on 27"
January to confirm that sufficient
progress has been made to go to the 10.

that on-screen error messages had
occurred at both offices which meant that
their Branch Trading Statements could
not be completed.

The root cause position at Coton house
was understood, but the Warwick office
had additional complexities.

It was confirmed, however, that in both
cases the underlying data integrity and
external feeds to POL-MI and POL-MS
were not affected.

AG3.71

Info

Double settlement at Derby. In
addition to the above, there have been 2
instances of a transaction appearing to
be settled twice. This was picked up by
the standard reconciliation process and
corrected via BAU processes. However
the root cause is yet to be identified, and
investigation is underway.

Decision - Postponement of next 10
branches. Based on the lack of a
known root cause for AG3.70 and
AG3.71, it was agreed that the next 10
branches should be postponed until the
impact and way forward is fully
understood. A checkpoint will be held at
10:30 on Friday 29" Jan, with follow-up
RAB still timetabled for 18' Feb. No
