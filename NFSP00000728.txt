Dear George

Further to the discussions we have had between us since the inception of the Grant Agreement in 2013, I can confirm
that we are now in a position to agree publication of the agreement (and associated Novation Agreement).

We have decided previously that this would be via NFSP publishing via your website — please proceed with this as soon
as possible. I have attached a PDF version of each document — please can you ensure for the GA it is clear that this was

the version that was entered into and the date of the agreement (21/7/15).

Please advise when this has been placed on your website and a copy of the link.

Rgds
