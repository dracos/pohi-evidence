Dimensions: The Post
Office Account Team
document library

Overview

The Post Office Account Team uses a document repository to maintain a controlled library of documents relating to the
Horizon system and its operation. This library, known as Dimensions, includes contractual, architectural and process
documents, many of which have been agreed between FSL and Post Office. The library uses document status, review
and version control processes, some of which is facilitated by a Dimensions mailbox.

Records

There are various documents stored in Dimensions which FSL legal considers an IT expert may need to consider when
investigating the Horizon system’s operation, including but not limited to:

Architecture and design documents

Process and procedure documents for managing problems and incidents
Service Descriptions

Service Management documents

Test documents

Documents relating to Releases

Interface specifications

Reports and audits

eee ee eee

Some of the documents retained in the Dimensions system are referred to in this table in footnotes. Such documents
normally contain a formal reference code, together with a version number and a date of issue or approval and this
information is reflected in the footnotes where available. Documents normally contain version histories, reviewer and
contributor names, glossaries and list associated documents.

To give a sense of the scale of this repository, in relation to Horizon Online, there are currently approximately 3,500

live documents. There are also over 2,000 “withdrawn” documents. Superseded and prior versions of Dimensions

Documents stored in Dimensions
are controlled and are generally

documents are also retained in Dimensions and there are a total of over 37,000 documents stored in the Horizon Online

repository. A separate Dimensions repository contains documentation relating to Legacy Horizon, created mostly
between 1996 and 2010.

The Peak system

Overview

In summary, Peak is an incident and release management system and work allocation tool. It is used by many teams in
FSL to support the Horizon system, including 3” Line support, 4" Line support, release management, integration and
test teams. It is a live database used operationally to manage, amongst other things, identified incidents, including
reconciliation errors and software defects. The Peak system has been in place since 2003 (prior to which the PinICL
system was used).

Records
There are currently approximately 260,000 Peaks in the live Peak database. Peaks have creation dates and should note

when they were updated. Peaks may contain various searchable attributes such as the unique Post Office branch code
known as a “FAD Code”.

The Peak Database is generally
available for the lifetime of
Horizon, although it is understood
that certain attachments to Peaks
may no longer be available.

Knowledge Base
Articles (“KBs”)
(formerly Known

Error Logs (“KELs”))

Overview

AKBis raised when a member of FSL’s architecture, development, test or support team identifies information that may
be beneficial to share with the FSL support team.

Governance
Aweekly KB review forum is held and is managed by the Service Management team (Incident Management).

Records

FSL can produce an extract from
the KB database.

Please note, for various reasons,
not all KBs which have been
created during the lifetime of
Horizon are retained in the KB
database’.

1 The availability of KBs is discussed in Mr Justice Fraser’s judgment in the Bates v Post Office group litigation (at which time they were referred to as KELs) and it has also been the subject
of evidence in the Inquiry.

Data Category Description of Data Records

KBs are stored in a database, so that when an issue is identified, support staff can crosscheck the database to see if a
similar issue has been seen before and how such issues have previously been handled. The KB database can be accessed
via the SSC Website (see row 18 below). KBs record information on many types of issues related to the Horizon system’s
operation. This should include information regarding an event, failure, fault, user error or a potential bug.

Minutes and actions should be produced and sent out after the weekly KB review forum. An agenda should also be sent
out prior to the meeting by the Incident Management team.

performed using the APPSUP role are logged to a table in the BRDB (specifically the “SYS.AUD$” table).°

Records

Records capturing the granting and revoking of the APPSUP role and corrections undertaken by FSL staff members using
it may include:

* TFS Now (e.g. TFS Now incidents, CHGs and CTasks’);

e = Peak;

* The “SYS.AUD$” table in the BRDB. Note the actions written to the “SYS.AUDS” table are subsequently written to
the Audit Archive.

Microsoft Teams and Outlook messages may also be used in the course of following the procedures set out in the
Horizon Data Changes Process Work Instruction to arrange for the APPSUP role to be granted or revoked.

Counter Access

FSL also provides a regular weekly Counter Access Report to Post Office. These are relatively recent reports (circa mid
2022 onwards) which provide details of commands executed against a counter by FSL support staff. These reports relate
to read-only access to live counters. Whilst these reports will not demonstrate any corrections made by FSL support
staff, they may help identify Peaks where FSL staff are requested to investigate a branch.

Older records

As noted below, some change records (such as historical OCRs/OCPs*) contain information and authorisation regarding
FSL staff members using remote access powers which could affect the financial position of a Post Office branch.

Management of Bugs,
Errors and Defects
(“BEDs”)

Overview

‘As noted in the covering letter to this Appendix, Horizon has had, and continues to have BEDs. Such BEDs either have
affected or have the potential to affect financial accounts. There are a number of processes and associated records
relating to identifying, tracking and resolving BEDs which are retained by the Post Office Account Team. Below is a non-
exhaustive list of such records and processes. Further, in February 2021 FSL prepared a report to Post Office (titled BED
Current Process Report) explaining the process for the management of bugs, errors and defects (as it existed at that
time).° The POA Live Defect Management Procedures document” seeks to provide a consolidated view of the Post
Office Account Team’s end-to-end process for managing live defects.

Governance and records

The Horizon Defects Review (“HDR”) is a joint forum held weekly (from around June 2021) between FSL and Post Office
with the purpose of governing the defect management process." The weekly meeting is intended to track the status
of open defects from their identification to resolution’.

Typically, in advance of the meeting FSL sends to Post Office a report known as the “HDR Defects Update Report”
(discussed further below in this row). This report is then considered at the meeting. Following the meeting, Post Office
typically sends FSL two documents: i) an Excel “Defect Tracker” document which includes Post Office’s view of defects
contained in the HDR Defects Update Report and ii) an Excel document (called “Horizon Defects Review Forum —
Meetings Notes”) which contains, amongst other things, meeting attendees and agreed actions arising from the
meeting. Emails between FSL and POL relating to the HDR meeting also exist, some of which are centrally stored in a
SharePoint site.

There have been various predecessor meetings to the HDR, such as the Horizon Known Error Review Forum (the
“HKERF”) which was established in approximately September 2019. It is understood that this forum has over time been
referred to by different names, such as the KEL Review Forum, Horizon Governance Working Group and the Horizon

Known Errors Joint Review Working Group. Similar records to those used by the HDR are assumed to exist for these
predecessor meetings but we have not verified this at the time of writing save to confirm that, for the HKERF, it is
understood that Post Office produced a weekly email summarising which Peaks and KBs were being focussed on by
that forum. The transition from HKERF to the new format HDR meeting took place between around March to June
2021.

Reports

FSL produces various reports recording issues identified in Peaks"? which have been tagged as HDR Defects, Live Defects
or both. Definitions of these are set out in section 1.3 of POA Live Defect Management Procedures’ and are
summarised below:

© A “Live Defect”*® is any issue which (i) is present on the live system, (ii) falls within FSL’s scope of obligations
and (iii) is, or appears to be, inconsistent with the agreed design or service specification. Such defects are
therefore likely to need fixing.

¢ A“HDR Defect” is a sub-set of Live Defects and is an issue which has the potential to affect (i) branch financial
outcomes, (ii) the way an end user of Horizon in branch (such as a sub-postmaster) is required use the system
or (iii) the experience of a Post Office customer or client. HDR Defects are classed as either “Financial”
impacting (which Post Office refers to as “Impact” and which FSL refers to as “Financial”) or “Experience”
impacting.

When FSL raises a HDR Defect, Post Office should assign its own corresponding problem reference number in its Service
Now tooling for tracking and management purposes. FSL uses a process to extract the latest data from the Peak
database in order to compile the three reports summarised below:

* HDR Defects Update Report: A weekly report is sent to Post Office in Excel format (with a date/time stamp)
containing all Peaks tagged as HDR Defects. As noted above, this report is considered at the weekly HDR meeting.
It contains information including a description of each HDR Defect, root cause analysis, proposed steps to resolve
the issue and any known branch impact as identified by FSL at that time. The Excel also includes the corresponding

* POAHNG-x All Live Defects Report: FSL generally sends to Post Office on a fortnightly basis a report on alll Live
Defects (which will include all HDR Defects given they are a subset of All Live Defects). The report is in PDF format
with a date/time stamp. It contains a summary front page followed by a table of all Live Defects.

Live Defect Management Update (internal FSL): FSL generally produces a monthly report internally in PowerPoint
format which is sent to certain FSL Post Office Account Team managers. It contains totals of All Live Defects
(including HDR Defects), the releases that fixes of the defects are targeted at, annual trends, information regarding
the numbers of open defects for previous years and summaries of particular defects from the Peak system.

Release Management

Overview

The Horizon system is updated by the implementation of new releases. In broad terms, releases are a documented
collection of software and/or data. They can also include system infrastructure items and reference data. Software
releases result from a number of different requirements such as a change to services (e.g. adding new functionality),
supporting new procedures, improving performance and, importantly, fixing BEDs.

The following Dimensions documents contain further information about the release management process and its
operation:

understood to be created each calendar year.
For Programme Releases, governance meetings and documents include the Release Planning Meeting (sometimes
referred to as the Release Management Forum), the Demand Planning Forum, the Forward Schedule of Change (or FSC)
meeting, and the Quality Filtering Process meeting.
‘As noted above, since Counter Releases require collaboration between FSL, Post Office and DXC, joint meetings are
held between FSL and Post Office to manage them. Two key meetings are the Release Acceptance Meeting (“RAM”)
and the Release Authorisation Board (“RAB”). The RAM focusses on reviewing release requirements, test outputs and

related documentation. Taking into consideration outputs from the RAM, the RAB focusses on reviewing deployment
readiness for a release and service acceptance. The RAB will decide whether to authorise the deployment of the release.
In practice, the RAM and the RAB are held as a single meeting. FSL holds documentation associated with the RAM and
RAB meetings, including minutes of meetings.

For Maintenance Releases, the Business Impact Forum (“BIF”) and the Peak Targeting Forum (“PTF”) are both internal
FSL governance forums (chaired by the Release Management team) and are intended to identify and monitor Peaks
requiring software fixes to be delivered in a Maintenance Release. The Terms of Reference for the internal BIF/PTF
meeting are contained within POA Live Defect Management Procedures?® (see section 2.7 “Key Meetings”). FSL
understands minutes for these meetings were created in the past, but ceased to be taken approximately in 2021.
Currently, outputs from the BIF/PTF meeting are captured and recorded in the BIF/PTF tab of the Release Schedule.

In addition to the above, FSL and Post Office should discuss items escalated from the BIF which are determined to
require Post Office consideration at the HDR (referred to in row 5 above). These discussions previously took place in a
separate meeting known as the Customer Business Impact Forum (“CBIF”). FSL understands CBIF minutes remain
available from July 2019 to July 2021.

There is a further monthly internal FSL forum known as the Agree Release Backlog Maintenance Forum which is used
to review Peaks which the BIF has decided not to prioritise for fixing in a maintenance release. It is understood that
these Peaks may be resolved by a future release.

For Emergency Changes, it is understood by FSL legal that these can be approved by the Change Advisory Board (“CAB”)
or via the Emergency Change Advisory Board (“ECAB”). FSL holds minutes in relation to the CAB meeting. We
understand that ECAB approvals are handled via messages between CAB members rather than at a specific ECAB
meeting.

FSL holds Release Notes, raised in Peak, which detail changes, enhancements or fault fixes that are to be deployed in
the live Horizon estate.

The Reconciliation I Overview End to End _ Reconciliation

Service

In broad terms, the Reconciliation Service compares transaction and other types of data i) as recorded by Horizon with
ii) the corresponding data held by third parties, such as financial institutions. Its purpose is to check transactions
processed through Horizon.

The Reconciliation Service checks if the data matches, produces reports regarding the same and identifies where the
data does not match. Where the data does not match, this is known as a reconciliation error. Reconciliation errors could
be caused by Horizon system failures or faults and could affect transactions in Post Office branches.

FSL used Data Reconciliation Service version 1 (“DRSv1”) until approximately 2020, at which time it was largely replaced
by the current system in use, known as Data Reconciliation Service version 2 (“DRSv2”).2°

More detailed information regarding the Reconciliation Service is contained in the Reconciliation Service Description”.
Reports

Various reports are generated by the Reconciliation Service. A list of these reports is set out in the ‘End to End
Reconciliation Reporting’ document.”

By way of example, FSL regularly produces and sends to Post Office ‘NB102 Reports’. This is a group of reports
highlighting mismatches in banking withdrawals and deposits, payments and E-TopUp transactions.

Business Incident Management Service (“BIMS”) and associated reports

Reconciliation reporting activity is currently the responsibility of the FSL Major Account Controller (or MAC) team.

Where a reconciliation error is identified, a BIMS Peak is raised containing details of the error. Details of the
reconciliation error from the BIMS Peak are entered into an Access database (the “BIMS Access database”). BIMS

Itis understood that events come through a collection layer and that certain events are filtered for the SMC’s purposes.
Events can be extracted into Excel spreadsheets by the SMC team up to 30 days.

Tivoli

Tivoli is a set of third-party system management toolsets. It has been used by the Post Office Account Team to provide
event management, system monitoring, and software distribution activities. In particular, the toolset was used to
manage the distribution of software to Post Office counters, each of which is individually identified by a unique node
that includes the FAD code and a counter number. FSL can extract various reports from the Tivoli reporter database.

Reference Data

Overview

Reference data, in broad terms, is data about products and other operational elements. For example, the price of a
stamp is controlled by reference data. As the price of a stamp will change over time, we understand that a design
decision was taken not to hard code the price into the system since changes in price would require new code. Instead,
the price is contained (and updated) in a set of Reference Data that the Post Office branch counters can refer to. Issues
with reference data have caused and could cause discrepancies in Post Office branches. The Reference Data
Management Service: Service Description? and the Interface Agreement for Operational Business Change — Reference
Data®® contain further information regarding reference data.

Records
Reference data delivered from Post Office to FSL is loaded into a Reference Data Management Centre database (the

“RDMC database”). The RDMC database contains multiple versions of reference data over time (i.e. reference data for
the past, present and future).

‘As noted in row 14, the counter will periodically refresh the reference data set it holds locally. There is a separate
database, derived from the RDMC database, which holds only the reference data set for the single point in time that is
today (the “Reference Data Delivery Service database”). This is the reference data set which is used by the Post Office
Branch counters when they periodically refresh their reference data.

FSL’s legal team understands from the Post Office account that not all reference data originates from Post Office. It is
understood that certain reference data originates from FSL and that such reference data is also released to the RDMC.

TfS Now

Overview

TfSNow is the current service management toolset used by the Post Office Account Team to record and manage Incidents,
Problems and Changes. It has an integration to Peak for FSL’s third and fourth line support teams and also to the Post.
Office ServiceNow toolset to allow shared tickets to replicate specified updates. It has been in use since approximately
2018.3,

Within TFS Now there are records of (i) Incidents (actual or perceived faults), (ii) Problems (recurring or underlying
issues) and (iii) Changes (requirements to amend the configuration) records as summarised below.

TES Now Incidents (Inc): TfS Now is used as an incident ticketing system to raise incidents and also to bond together
incidents from different systems (such as Peak tickets and Post Office raised tickets notified to the FSL MAC team).
Note that not all information is transferred between the TfsNow and Peak systems and therefore tickets passed
between these systems should be looked at together to understand more about the incidents they relate to.

TfS Now Problems (Prb): A TfS Now Problem is usually raised where a number of Incidents appear to have a
common theme.

© TFS Now Change (CHG): Examples of Changes include deploying a Programme Release or Maintenance Release. As
noted above in row 6 certain, some operational changes are implemented using TfSNow Change. We understand
that Changes can be subdivided in the system into sub-tasks known as CTasks.

Records

These Change, Incident and Problem records can be exported into a PDF or Excel document.

2018 to present: TfS Now

Hera, Apollo, OCP, OCR and the
MSC toolset)

Certain information in the BRDB is sent to the Audit Archive. FSL is not currently in a position to confirm precisely which

further information in this regard. The FSL Archive Server Configuration document* also indicates there are various
audit points and subpoints in the BRDB which are harvested into the audit archive.

In broad terms, the BAL exchanges messages with Post Office branch counters and other parts of the Horizon system.
FSL legal understands that it acts as a distribution and load balancing service allocating activity. The BAL sits between
the counters and services that the Counter Business Application (“CBA”)°” at the Post Office branch utilises (such as the
BRDB, the CDP*8 and the GWS?%). Messages and transactions which happen at the counter are first passed to the BAL

The BAL platform consists of 10 individual BALs. Two applications, known as Online Service Routers (OSRs), run on each
of the 10 BALs (i.e. there are 20 OSRs in total). The OSRs hold data including:

© The Message.log - this contains request messages, including transactions, sent to and received from the BAL. This
log may be used to investigate transactions. It could be compared with the message log generated at a counter.

e The Osr.log — the OSR application log records data regarding the functioning of it as an application. If, for example,
the OSR has an error sending a transaction to an endpoint, it will be recorded in the Osr.log whereas the counter
may only see a timeout.

e The Syslog — this is the BAL event log. It is analogous to the Windows event log retained on PCs in Post Office
branches.

We have not yet ascertained the extent to which such logs are sent to the Audit Archive and which may therefore be
available for extraction.

Post Office Counters
in branches

Overview

In addition to Horizon data stored in datacentres operated by FSL, certain Horizon data is stored locally within counters
in Post Office branches. The counter generates various logs and also holds a copy of the reference data currently in
use (in XML format).

The CBA is a Java application supplied by FSL which runs on equipment procured by the Post Office from other third-
party suppliers. It provides an interface for the counter operator to transact a range of products, including sending or
receiving information to or from third parties (such as financial institutions and utilities suppliers). The CBA sends
messages to the BAL which in turn routes the messages to an appropriate endpoint, including the BRDB or other
service such as the Common Digital Platform (or CDP)*?.

as messages that were displayed at the counter, communications between PINPads and the counter) and reports
sent to the tally roll or back office printer (depending on the configuration and hardware of the relevant Post
Office branch).

e The Message.log containing messages, including transactions, sent to and received from the BAL.

e The PBSIL.log containing data of interactions between the CBA and the counter PinPads. PBSIL stands for Payment
and Banking Service Isolation Layer.

© The C3.log and C3Crypt.log containing data related to counter PINPad interactions. Both are created by third-
party WorldLine applications and are not readable by FSL without support from Worldline. In some circumstances
Worldline will request these logs from FSL for their own investigations. Note the C3Crypt.log ceased to be created
recently.

© CounterMemoryProfile.log which records of memory metrics from the CBA. This could potentially be useful, for
example, to investigate the cause of a slow running counter.

 — Stopcba.log which records start-up information from the CBA before the PostOfficeCounter.log is created. The
CBA does not contain any user actions; it records the status of the system before a user logs on and may be looked
at if there have been problems in the operation of the CBA.

e Reference Data working day set — the reference data that is currently in use by the counter. Post Office maintains
acentral reference data server and the counter periodically refreshes/updates its Reference Data working day set
to ensure up to date reference data is used.

maintained by third party suppliers rather than FSL. The Windows event log relating to the counter should contain

example one of the services handled by HBS is a web page based help and information service for Post Office branch
staff, called the Counter Help Service.

The HBS produces a number of logs. FSL understands these are retained operationally for a maximum of between 3 to

transactions performed on the kiosk nodes.
We have not yet ascertained the extent to which such logs are sent to the Audit Archive and which may therefore be

Management around the end of 2009

FSL maintains an Estate Management Database (“EMDB”), a suite of databases housing Estate Management
configuration and change data required by or supplied to various clients and endpoints. The data includes items such
as IP addresses, counter numbers per branch and other information used by various interfaces (e.g. by a merchant
acquirer interface used to source terminal identifiers that are required to support certain in branch transactions)

Design documents exist for Estate Management in Dimensions, such as the Estate Management Database (EMDB) High
Level Design‘® and the System and Estate Management — Overall Architecture.*®

Records

The EMDB contains history tables which record changes made to the EMDB. Log files of access to EMDB data are also
created, Back-ups of the EMDB are taken nightly but these are only retained for two days. It is presently unclear to the
FSL legal team whether and to what extent other back up processes are undertaken of the EMBD which could have
longer retention periods.
