It can see that the clerk pressed Enter 4 times after the Delivery Receipts were printed, and each time a rem in transaction for

[Start of Response]

je have found that if there is a logout before a user has fully logged on, then subsequently a pouch is remmed in manually (most
likely at an outreach branch), then after the rem in slip has been printed, the same screen is redisplayed and the user is likely
co press Enter again and duplicate the remittance, possibly several times. A different screen should be displayed which would
prevent this happening.

6:36 User:Anne Chambers

I, rem in slip is printed each time, showing the same details but different session numbers, and a transaction log search confirms
the repeated rems.

[this is not an area that has changed for several years so it likely to have happened before but we have no record of it having
been reported to us. I can only check back two months; I've found 4 other instances (outreach branches 214869, 106444, 110444,
207828) and all but the last removed the discrepancy by completing a rem out for the excess, which corrected the system cash
holding. Branch 224843 may be able to do the same but NBSC should advise on this.

je are continuing to investigate the problem (PC0246997), but any fix will not retrospectively change the branch accounts.
