Subject: Re: Update after Tuesday's Board meeting

chris/Alwen, thx. I guessed something similar from the nervous discussion around it.

Chris, your note seems to say two things - sorry should have read it more carefully and asked all my
questions in one go - ie., that there could be an impact re cost of insurance: future premiums possibly
across several policies? And secondly, that we were going to check if we are covered. (Does that mean
we may not be?)

advised by our insurance broker, Miller. Their view is that whilst other insurance policies may be
impacted the most likely one is D&O - this has the added complication as it is the only policy we share
with RM and was placed by their broker, JLT. The excess on this policy varies under different criteria
but the main one is £25k on each and every claim. A meeting is being set up with JLT and Miller to ensure
they are fully briefed on the issues before JLT engage with the insurer.
