Branch Support Programme -Background &

To address the concerns of some subpostmasters over recent years about
Horizon, the Post Office commissioned forensic accountants, Second Sight in 2012
to undertake an independent review of the cases.

The interim report was published in July 2013 and whilst the report identified
that there were no systemic issues with the Horizon system, it suggested that
Post Office should examine the training and support offered to it subpostmasters.

As a result the Branch Support Programme was established to review

the lifecycle of the subpostmaster’s experience with Post Office; to “fix” the issues
identified in the Second Sight report and the subsequent mediation cases and

to ensure any lessons learnt are factored into future ways of working.

A LEAN approach is being used to map the critical business processes within the
scope of the 9 programme work streams to ensure that the most cost effective
process is delivered to reduce non-value add activity. High level mapping has
identified a

40% reduction opportunity in network support costs ie c.£3m pa. This methodology
also

helps to embed the principles of continuous improvement within the relevant work

areas. (2)

Branch Support Programme - Purpose & Guiding &
Principles

Purpose

The purpose of the Branch Support Programme (BSP) is to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of the support we provide to our subpostmasters
and operators in the running of their Post Offices from an operational and
engagement perspective.

Guiding Principles

There are three guiding principles that underpin our new ways of working approach
and how we interact with our Subpostmasters and others. These principles
should be embedded in all areas of the Post Office. The outputs of the
Programme will be tested against each of these principles:

* Treat with dignity & respect at all times
¢ Stand in Spmr’s shoes

* Right first time

Branch Support Programme — 14/15 &

Implementation

*Revised on-line subpostmaster appointment — to ensure that Post
Office attracts and recruits the right subpostmaster at a time when the
network is undergoing its biggest physical transformation in history.

*Replace the majority of new entrant classroom with on-line training -
80% reduction in classroom training course content for new colleagues and
subpostmasters with on-line learning modules.

*Re-writing Horizon processes - to reduce the rate of errors and losses
will deliver both a financial and a resource benefit in chasing those errors

*Introduce a Customer Management System - delivering a consistent IT
platform for those teams supporting branches will enable operating cost
reduction benefits to be realised.
