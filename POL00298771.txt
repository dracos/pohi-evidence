Mediation Pack agreed by Working Group Green

* The Working Group have agreed to extend the submission date to 18"

November as the date for launch has been pushed back, so that
SPMRs have enough time to submit their applications.

The pack will be distributed to via JFSA, Shoosmiths, JA MPs, BIS MPs
and those sent directly to the Post Office.

Finding and agreeing a panel of independent advisors continues so
that we can provide a mix of legal and accounting support for SPMRs
with good geographical coverage.

Planning for the 5" Sept training day for independent advisors and
mediators is progressing.

Planning meeting with Brian Altman QC. The QC will provide an initial Amber
steer on the process for existing cases. This session will be the first

step in helping us define a process for future cases.

Current plan will be reviewed following QC steer.

We are urgently working with our external firms to identify an

independent expert to provide evidence on the Horizon system.

Risks Ce

An initial risk workshop was run on the 15" August. At the workshop we
identified the key risks, their likelihood and potential impact.

The next workshop will document how we monitor and mitigate these
risks. Key risks will be tracked and presented at the weekly steering
board.

Below are the risks highlighted in the board paper 26" July 2013:

*the reputational and brand risks that could emerge if we don’t handle the overall
resolution process carefully;

ethe risk to NTP if concerns around how we treat sub-postmasters leads to lower take-up
of the new models;

* the opportunity cost arising from the significant amount of senior management time that
will be taken up in handling this process;

* the potential destabilising impact on the NFSP, who are feeling exposed to the whole
issue because of accusations from some sup-postmasters that they failed to represent
their interests; and

* the process re-engineering that may be required for our IT, training and support
systems will add further complexity and risk to the existing transformation programme.
