Subject: Suspense - independent firm - scope & procedures drafts
Attachment: Suspense - Scoping Doc for Indep Rvw.docx
Attachment: Suspense Agreed upon procedures.docx

Alisdair, Peter - same scoping paper as at 6pm but with a draft "Agreed Upon Procedures" report to help progress what I
expect could be a challenging discussion as to what Second Sights expectations would be of such a review and what a
firm would feel able to opine on. On the expectation that the auditors "report" would need to be able to be shared with
Second Sight then I expect we would need a three way engagement letter which would no doubt have some hurdles in
drafting in terms of scope, limitation of liability and form of output.

Thanks, Rod

Hi Peter, Draft one pager attached. With a question in it for us to consider as I think the exact "opinion" / "statement" at
the end of this work and the agreement on sharing it with SS as well as with POL will have hurdles in terms of
engagement letter etc. Thanks, Rod

> Will do. Do you have a preference between the firms? Is there a benefit in using PwC as independent from audit. Or
conversely a benefit in EY as they are our auditors and therefore could be seen to have a higher level of credibility?

>>> Thanks, as well as completing this can you have a go at producing a simple table in the gross movements year by
year that we can put in a letter tomorrow. We should then be able to summarise again by year the value and volume of
the individual vs the mass transactions, adding caveats as appropriate to what we haven't looked at. We then quote the
stats on the average and maximum values of the individuals, looked at collectively, and the most per branch. That is the
data context we could send tomorrow. Would it be accurate for us to then say. "From the work done to date the combined
transactions do not have audit trails that enable them to be broken down by originating transaction and it would not
therefore be possible to follow them through from the other direction. Individual transaction details are of course available
in the ledgers, they just can't be traced through in this way. When we meet we would therefore like to discuss how we
could work together to identify transactions or branches and time periods of interest based on the individual files, such
that we could see whether anything had been processed through to the client account."

>>>

>>> It is feeling like we need a couple of people from EY to execute this work for us in a records driven and independent
way, freeing you up more for the day job. I am equally nervous of setting hares running and if giving information that
might not be strictly accurate.

>>> Can you have a go at the letter for tonight, sticking strictly to the truth and not worrying about what I might want it to
say. If I don't talk to you before I will call you in the lunch break of the EXCO.
