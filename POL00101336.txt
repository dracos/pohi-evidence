Sorry - the news desk: so the staff who oversee what is going out on air and who should (notionally)
ensure fairness, impartiality and accuracy.

>> Hi Paula

>

>> The coverage is essentially suggesting that we now accept through the report that there are issues
with Horizon. It is sloppy journalism in the extreme. I have spoken direct to the journalist to
(robustly) correct the impression he is creating and we are talking also to BBC newsgathering. I've had a
huddle with Chris and the lawyers and we hold that in our back pocket as a potential action if coverage
doesn't change.

>

>> They have broadcast old interviews with subpostmasters - they clearly cannot get any current
applicants or JFSA to comment publicly.

>

>> There is no comment from MPs.

>> I will send transcript asap
