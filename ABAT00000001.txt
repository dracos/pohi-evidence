Thank you for your letter of 20 May, requesting a meeting to discuss the Post
Office Horizon system.

Since 2001, when the Royal Mail (which includes Post Office Ltd (POL)) was
set up as a public limited company with the Government as its only shareholder,
Government has adopted an arm's length relationship with the company so that
it has the commercial freedom to run its business operations without
interference from the shareholder.

The integrity of the Post Office Horizon system is an operational and contractual
matter for POL and not Government, whilst I do appreciate your concerns and
those of the Alliance members, I do not believe a meeting would serve any
useful purpose.
