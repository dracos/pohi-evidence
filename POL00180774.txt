Jarnail, as this was a case whereby Horizon was being cited as being at fault; I’m not sure if we want to accompany the

change in stance with a carefully worded missive stating that our position is not an admission of Horizon integrity issues
(as it stands one of my security managers has been asked to advise the suspect — presumably verbally). Apologies if this
is already to hand but I’m conscious of the impact the decision may have on similar cases going forward.

Regards
