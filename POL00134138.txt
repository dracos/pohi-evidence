Helen,
I understand your concerns.

It would be relatively simple to add an extra column into the existing ARQ report spreadsheet, that would make it
clear whether the Reversal Basket was generated by Recovery or not. I think this would address your concern.

\’m not sure what the formal process is for changing the report layout.

Penny can you advise as to the process: Is this done through a CR?

Regards

Gareth

Hi Gareth

Thanks for the response.. I can see where this transaction is and now understand the reason behind it. My
main concern is that we use the basic ARQ logs for evidence in court and if we don’t know what extra
reports to ask for then in some circumstances we would not be giving a true picture.

I know you are aware of all the horizon integrity issues and I want to ensure that the ARQ logs are used
and understood fully by our operational staff that have to work with this data both in interviews and in court.

Just one question from my part.. if the reversal is system created but shows as an existing reversal.. could
this not be reflected with a different code..i.e. SR (system reversed) to clear up any initial challenges. My
feelings at the moment are not questioning what Horizon does as I fully believe that it is working as it
should, it is just that I don’t think that some of the system based correction and adjustment transactions are
clear to us on either credence or ARQ logs.

Helen,

The files 4 to 25 Oct 12.xls and Events 4 to 25 Oct 12.x/Is are part of the standard ARQ returned.

Rows 141 to 143 of 4 to 25 Oct 12.x/s clearly show a Reversal. Also Row 70 of Events 4 to 25 Oct 12.xls shows that
session 537803 (ie rows 138 to 140 of 4 to 25 Oct 12.xIs) has been recovered and this event has the same timestamp

as the Reversal Session. Also row 71 of Events 4 to 25 Oct 12.x/s shows that a receipt was generated from the session
537805 (not explicitly, but it was the only session at that time). This receipt would have told the user that a Rollback
POL00134138
POL00134138

had taken place (but the logs don’t make that explicit).
If that is sufficient for you purposes, then you do have all you need in the standard ARQ.

However what I was able to confirm from my look at Live data a couple of weeks ago and is also held in the underlying
raw logs is confirmation that the reversal was generated by the system (and not manually by the user). What might
also be available in the underlying logs is whether or not the system was re-booted — I suspect it was but have no
evidence one way or the other (and it isn’t in what was extracted this time either). I can confirm that the user did Log
On again (row 69 of Events 4 to 25 Oct 12.xIs).

Do you need anything further from me on this incident?

Regards

Gareth

I’m out of the office this week. I'll get the logs from Penny on Monday and then be able to see exactly what you have.

Is that soon enough?

Hi Gareth

I have received the ARQ logs today and I can see clearly the recovery session. Could you tell me if this
would always be available on all ARQ logs requested or is it something you requested specially for me
after being aware of the issue at this office?
