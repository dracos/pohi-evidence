Question from: Brooks Newmark (Braintree - CON)

Minister answering: Rt Hon Pat McFadden

Question

To ask the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, whether
he has received reports of errors in the Post Office Horizon system which have led to

Postmasters or Postmistresses being falsely accused of fraud; and if he will make a

statement. 291675

Draft Answer

The Department has received no such reports. Any issues relating to the Horizon system
are operational matters for Post Office Ltd. I have therefore asked Alan Cook, Managing

Director of Post Office Ltd, to respond directly to the Hon Member and a copy of his reply

will be placed in the House Libraries.
