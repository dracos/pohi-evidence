Dear Mr Brook
Re Branch Discrepancies - Rosyth Terminus

You may have been aware of 2 unexplained discrepancies that have
impacted your branch.

I can confirm that losses totalling £41.77 declared at both TP9 in 2011/12
and 2012/13 were not proper to your branch. This problem was created
by a specific set of circumstances dating back to actual gains you
declared and cleared in 2010 (TP8).

In brief the stock unit that declared and cleared the relevant discrepancies
was deleted on or before 10th December 2010. The related Local
Suspense entry should also have been removed, but this did not happen.

The impact of this was that the net clearance of the gain of 2010 was
picked up again at the beginning of TP9 the next year in Horizon and
treated as a loss. At the end of TP9 the branch was forced to clear this
along with current discrepancies. The Local Suspense ledger in the Post
Office Finance System was impacted in the same way.

This scenario was then repeated at the same point the next year.

Both TP9 discrepancies recorded at your branch were of course assigned
to nominee at the point of branch trading and were included in monthly
statements for settlement. Post Office Ltd will add £83.54 credit to your
next statement and will be included in the next settlement made.

Changes to Horizon in 2011 prevented this problem for stock units
deleted after mid-December 2010, and the old Local Suspense entry has
now been removed from the system.

I do apologise for this problem being allowed to occur and impacting
your branch.

Yours sincerely
