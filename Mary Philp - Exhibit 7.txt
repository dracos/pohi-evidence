Dear Mary,

Thank you for your patience while we review your enquiry. We previously confirmed that the
Historical Shortfall Scheme has closed so we cannot accept any further applications to join the
scheme. We're writing to reassure you that we are still reviewing your enquiry. We are sorry that it is
taking a little time to come back to you but hope you understand that we do need to work through this
carefully to ensure the most effective way forward.

Please be assured that we will be in touch again about this as soon as possible.
Thank you very much for your continued patience.
Yours sincerely,
