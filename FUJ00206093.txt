Do you want to give Chris a call to discuss?

Hi.

When you have a few moments could you give me a call please to discuss this.
I’ve spoken to Theo and he’s been asked to come via Security, he thinks it’s for compliance to ensure we’re not

sending data that would compromise a branch’s security but I’m thinking it’s because we request ARQ data and it
comes off our allowance. Have you asked them to come through us?

As per my previous email to you this morning we are getting considerable amounts of requests against our allowance.
Could we have a chat about how we can take these forward.

Regards,

Hi team,

We are trying to get hold of the last 6 months of Cash on Hand data from fujitsu. I have been pointed in your direction
in order to request the data from Fujitsu. They have informed me that the security team will need to place an ARQ
request with Fujitsu’s team - CSPOA Security CSPOA.Security!_

I believe the request is as follows;

The files are named HORCWCCOH*.XML and are delivered via PODG Route BRDB_FOR_CWC_PI. The files
contain summaries of cash on hand in each branch and contain no Personal data or PCI Cardholder Data. The
request is for all files from the 18" Sept 2018 to the current day. The files should be zipped in appropriate
chunks, password protected and delivered via Quatrix to the following email addresses:

Any issues let me know.

Best regards
Theo
