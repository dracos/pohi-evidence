I have duplicated the problem and I have been able to establish that the missing data is from the correspondence counters 37, 56
land 57 from the dates 14th - 21st June 2008.

It note that these correspondence counters are not the same as real counters and so no real counter data is lost.

i am rerunning the query on {IRRELEVANT

there are indeed gaps in the data returned by They are only for correspondence server nodes and not actual counters.

there were no gaps in the data returned from { ot the same FAD and date range.
jow at Horizon messages were logged by independent processes and went into different files for Bootle and Wigan. The fact that
correspondence nodes only are missing rather indicates a bug in this process and not in the gathering of the files by the audit
system. If the audit system had missed out a file you would likely as not have gaps in the actual Post Office counters too.

lso I conclude that there is no evidence of a bug in the audit system. I also note ng.Past_Qffice Counter message is missing at
all and the correspondence server messages are only missing from
