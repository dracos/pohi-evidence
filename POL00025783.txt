                                     Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme

                                            Suspense Account — second response

        Issue

        Second Sight has raised the following question of Post Office:

        "Could any SPMRs have been charged by Post Office Ltd for amounts that become
        incorporated in suspense account balances that were subsequently taken into profit by POL or
        any of its Counterparty Companies, or that remain as credit balances on the balance sheet of
        POL or any of its Counterparty Companies?"

        Post Office responded to this question in its paper of 29 July 2014. Second Sight has now
        raised further questions on this subject.

        Summary

        Second Sight's principal concern is that credit amounts' in the Suspense Account are
        absorbed by Post Office as profit rather than being returned to branches to balance out losses
        in those branches.

        Whether the cost of the unresolved discrepancy between Post Office and a client (whether
        held in the Suspense Account or otherwise) falls on a branch is not necessarily dependant on
        the position between Post Office and its client but principally turns on the actions of the
        branch in following, or not, the correct branch accounting process.

        As set out in Post Office's previous paper, so long as a Subpostmaster submits the applicable
        evidence from their branch's records to show there was no error on their part (ie. they have
        followed the correct branch accounting process), Post Office will not charge that branch (or
        will withdraw any related charge) arising from a discrepancy even where a client maintains
        that there is a discrepancy.

        Post Office's processes are therefore designed so that Subpostmasters are not
        disadvantaged by the operation of its Suspense Account and, if operated correctly, Post
        Office will not take into its own profit money that should have been credited to branches.

         The Suspense Account

    I   I The SuspR
                    1 se Account2 is an accounting tool for temporarily holding disputed differences on

        payments moving between Post Office and its clients. These amounts include not only
      2 differences on the transfer of "customer monies" to and from clients (such as bank account
3, 4, 5 deposits) but also differences on payments due ty.t9 Post Office to clients as the clients share
        of commissions paid by customers for the services it provides to clients (for example,
      6 commission share on travel insurance policies sold)d ot Post Office on the sale         travel
                                                                                                                   of




        insurance).

    7 The operation of the Suspense Account in relation to holding disputed shares of commission
    8 to clientsthe payments   services is outside the scope of this note and of the Scheme as
                                      for




      these payments do not affect branch accounting.


          Second Sight has made clear that it is only interested in credit amounts so they are the focus of this paper.
        2 There are in fact a number of different accounting ledgers that hold sums in suspense for different clients, products
        and services but for the sake of this paper we refer to them collectively as the Suspense Account.

RI I   The suspense account only holds the difference that is disputed. Eg. if POL thinks we
       owe £100 and the client says £80 then the suspense account holds £20. On first
       reading I read the wording as possibly inferring all £100 was held in suspense. On
       second reading I decided it was OK. Can I just check your understanding to ensure
       that you are clear it is the difference of £20 which goes in here. I think I would prefer
       it if you added the words "disputed differences on" in front of "the transfer of
       customer money" and in front of "payments due by Post Office"

The operation of Post Office's Suspense Account is not a discrete issue that can be examined
in isolation. It is just one mechanism in a wider range of reconciliation processes used to
identify, assess and correct discrepancies between accounting records held by branches,
Post Office and clients.

The question posed by Second Sight is very general. It potentially relates to all the products,
services and relationships that Post Office manages, each of which has a different operating
and reconciliation process. Providing one universal explanation of how the reconciliation
processes (including the operations of the Suspense Account) work in practice is not possible
given all these permutations.

Nevertheless, this paper endeavours to further explain the broad principles behind the
operation of the Suspense Account. It also includes a few illustrative examples of those
principles in action.

Credits to the Suspense Account

Second Sight has asked Post Office to focus on credits in its Suspense Account. In relation to
branch accounting, a credit to the Suspense Account can occur in two ways:

•         Transactions initiated in a branch which result in Post Office paying money to a client
          (eg. a customer pays a utility bill at a branch and Post Office pays a sum to the value
          of the bill to the utility company client).

          A credit will occur when the records on Horizon (as generated by a branch) show that a
          greater amount is due to the client than the client's records show, leading to a client
          refusing to accept the extra amount. If the discrepancy over the extra amount is not
          resolved in short order, it may then be moved to the Suspense Account as a credit.

•         Transactions initiated in a branch which result in Post Office receiving money from a
          client (eg. where a customer withdraws cash from their bank account at a branch and
          the client bank then reimburses Post Office to the value of the withdrawal).

          A credit will occur when the records on Horizon (as generated by a branch) show that a
          smaller amount is due from the client than the client's records show, leading to the
          client paying an extra amount to Post Office which Post Office does not consider to be
          due. If the discrepancy over the extra amount is not resolved in short order, it may
          then be moved to the Suspense Account as a credit.

Credits in the Suspense Account that remain unresolved for 3 years are moved to the Post
Office P/L Account — effectively Post Office absorbs these credits as profit. The operation of a
suspense account in this way is standard practice for most businesses.

Second Sight is concerned that an unresolved positive R~iscrepancy in Post Office's favour at
the client level may be placed in the Suspense Account as a credit and then be absorbed as
profit by Post Office when in fact it reflects a loss in a branch and should therefore have been
returned to the branch to balance out that loss.

Whether a positive discrepancy arising from a client reconciliation (or part thereof) is returned
to a branch depends on a number of factors: the nature of the underlying error/dispute,
whether a transaction correction has already been issued to a branch, whether the branch has
disputed the transaction correction (so that it has been withdrawn or suspended), etc.

       9    The general principles followed by Post Office when considering whether to return a positive
      10 discrepancy to a branch is to make an enquiry with the branch and explain the difference that
         has been identifiedare:

                        [~~.rXM.-    F.W.         MIG1Rl-T:E7. -     -                    -        TLT.TJ7/A1:t►,:~^.T-ti7:T17.




      12          2. If upon FSC explaining the particular difference to the branch, the branch confirms or
                     realises that they made an error in accounting and are able to explain that, then FSC
                     would return the credit to the branch

      13          3. If the branch locates missing paperwork or is otherwise able to help identify the
                     impacted customer (to whom the credit relates) then FSC will make the necessary
                     payment to the client with the details of the customer

      14          4. If a branch has followed the correct accounting process in branch (which means that
                     the branch's accounts will balance with no gain or loss (except where other unrek'ed
                                                                                                      KI4(-
                     issues cause a gain or loss at the same time), then Post Office will bear the loss
                     resulting from a discrepancy between the branch records and the client 's records.

   15, 16         5. If an error has been made in branch, whereby the branch did not take enough money
                     from the customer or gave too much money to the customer, compared to the
                     recorded value of the transaction then pursuant to the terms of the Subpostmaster
      17             Contract the branch is liable for any loss arising from that error. Formal escalation
                     processes are in place for banking miskeys to enable Post Office to seek customer
                     acknowledgement via their bank to recover keying errors and these are typically
                     successful with the goodwill of the customer, but in the extreme situation where the
                     customer refuses or where the branch does not realise it has made a mistake then
                     there would not be a credit centrally to be returned to the branch and the branch
                     would in that extreme have to make it good and has no ent itlement to have any,
                       positive     discrepancy         returned   to their branch



      18    Where the position is unclear, Post Office assumes, in a Subpostmaster's favour, that the
            branch     has   followed       the   correct   accounting   process

           In line with these general principles, Post Office will assess whether any positive discrepancy
           should be returned to a branch before moving that discrepancy into the Suspense Account as
           a credit. A credit put into a Suspense Account has therefore been determined, based on the
19, 20, 21 information available at the time, and the enquiries made, to either be due to Post Office or to
    22, 23 a client— — it is not due to a branch. The credit is held in the Suspense Account for 3 years in
           case any further information comes to light (either from the branch, the client or a customer)
           that allows the underlying discrepancy to be resolved. As such, when Post Office takes a
           credit in the Suspense Account into profit after 3 years, it is not taking any money properly
           due to a branch3.

           The exact implementation of this rule varies from product to product so it is not possible to
           describe a universal process map for how this happens. However, below Post Office has
           explained how this works in relation to two types of transactions that are thought to be of
      24 I particular interest to Second Sight. These are set out below.



            3 Post Office may be taking into profit money that is properly due to a client but that is a matter between Post Office and
            its client that does not affect the position of a branch.

       25     Before explaining these, Post Office also notes that credits in suspense are not a
              consequence of actions by POL to issue charges to branches. Credits arise due to a
              difference between how the branch recorded a transaction locally versus the downstream
              summarisation of data or paperwork arising from those transactions. Assuming the branch
              paid out or took in money to the same value as that of the transaction they recorded, then the
              branch would balance and there would be no discrepancy or disadvantage to the branch. If a
              difference arose where the client view exceeded the branch view, and if that did subsequently
              lead to a charge from POL to the branch, then evidence would be provided and the branch
              would be able to challenge the specific Transaction Correction.

        26 I The narrative in the sections titled "Summary" and "Client Reconciliation" of draft emailed on
           29 July 2014 at 12.00 may be useful too 1


              Example 1: Bank deposits

              Post Office offers personal banking services to customers including allowing them to make
              cash deposits into their accounts with their own banks.

           Where the bank deposit is conducted using a paying in slip4, branch staff must manually enter
           the value of the deposit on Horizon. The bank's record of the transaction is taken from the
        27 paying in slip that is passed from branch to IPSL who act as the clearing agent and
        28 intermediary to the banks for Post Offices ~~„e
                                                      to th bank.

              One type of error in this process that can give rise a Suspense Account credit is where a
   29, 30     paying-in slip is lost before reaching IPSLthe client bank. Without the paying in slip, IPSL
31, 32, ...   dothe bank maynot know thate an amount has beento-fie deposited byte a customer's
   35, 36     account nor the details of the customer's account to whom it should be credited. Without this
       37     information, the bank will only request payment for the deposits notified by IPSL and Post
              Office retains the difference in suspense pending enquiries with the relevant brancha bankwill
              decline    to accent   money    from   Post   Office   in respect   of the deposit



             This leads to the Horizon records showing a greater value of deposits (ie. payments due from
             Post Office to the bank) than the bank's records. If the discrepancy (being the extra amount
        38 I that is due to the bank when the customer is identifiedbut the bank refuses to take) cannot be
             resolved, it may be transferred into the Suspense Account as a credit.

              In this scenario, on identification of the discrepancy and usually long before any credit is
              moved to the Suspense Account, Post Office would contact the branch to see if they could
              explain what happened with the particular deposit in question.6

              If the branch has in fact conducted the deposit transaction correctly at the counter (ie. the
              amount of cash taken from the customer equals the value of the transaction recorded on
              Horizon by the branch) the branch's accounts will balance with no loss or gain. The resolution
              of the discrepancy is therefore solely a matter between Post Office and the client bank. If,
              down the line, the discrepancy is moved to the Suspense Account as a credit and then taken
              into Post Office's profit after 3 years, this will not disadvantage the Subpostmaster.


              4 This depends on the identity of the customer's bank. A minority of banks still require customers to use paying in slips;
              most banks now use a chip and pin system.

              5 This is actually Post Office's transaction handler.... ROD TO PROVIDE DETAILS

              6 This type of error is commonly resolved by the branch recognising that they had simply forgotten to remit out the
              paying in slip.

R15   What we discussed was an error in a deposit not a deposit when no deposit occurred.
      I don't think that would happen. What does happen is the situation of keying noughts
      erroneously on the end of a deposit value. That is what leads to the miskey escalation
      process that I added earlier in the note. For that reason I don't think these last 4
      paragraphs are right or are needed.

     Example 2: Cash dispensed from ATMs

40   Credit differences can arise on ATMs and are in respect of balancing errors and unidentified
     retracts in the ATMs. In each case, branch by branch, Post Office FSC would contact the
     branch to explain that the bank had reported a different dispensed value to the one recorded
     by the branch in Horizon.

41    The bank would not be aware that a retract had happened until a customer or branch flags an
      issue. The value recorded by the bank would therefore be the total intended to be dispensed,
      not reflecting that some had been retracted.

42   If the branch had had identified and accounted for retracts then a difference would arise and
     would be proper to be there. The branch books, in that case, would properly align to the cash
     on hand and it would be evident to all that there was a customer retract to be resolved. That
     value would then be held in suspense pending resolution with the customer. If, however, the
     customer never came forward or could not otherwise be identified then the value would
     ultimately be released to profit.

43   I It would not disadvantage a Subpostmaster.

                      Given the impracticality of identifying and narrating every transaction in these accounts, we set
                      out below two examples of specific clients where Post Office has released credits to Profit & Loss.
                      In both cases we do not consider that a branch would have been disadvantaged and we explain
                      why.


45                      Personal Banking Clients


46                      Branches take cash deposits on behalf of customers of a wide ranee of banks. Some banks
                        have a VocaLINK relationship with Post Office and the deposits can be processed by way of the
                        customer inserting their debit card in the pinpad. Some others (typically banks that Post Office
                        has worked with a long time) have not migrated the Post Office relationship to LINK and so the
                        branch has to take a paving in she from the customer.

47                   Such paying in slips are then sent to IPSL for processing. This then initiates the settlement
                     proposal from which Post Office makes navments to the relevant banks.


48                   If the paying in slips are not despatched by the branch to IPSL or if branches take card based
                     deposits for non VocaLINK enabled banks, then there will not be payment request initiated for
                     Post Office to pay the relevant bank.


49                   It means Post Office has a credit in its accounts, which needs paying to the bank but where the
                     relevant customer information is missing and so it would end up in suspense at the bank if it
                     were paid over.


50                   On the basis of the I PSL view of the data, Post Office makes a lower settlement to the relevant
                     bank than the Horizon data would suggest. Post Office then, however, seeks to identify who
                     the impacted customer is in order that the difference can be paid as soon as possible to the
                     bank with the relevant details for the bank to update the correct customers account.


51                   The branch is not impacted by this. So long as the branch keyed the value of the deposit
                     correctly (consistently between the paying in details and the cash taken) then there is no
                     scenario that the branch would become disadvantaged. It is the customer who is at risk of
                     being disadvantaged.


52                   Post Office FSC match the data from IPSL against the deposit data fed through from Horizon to
                     try to identify the originating branch in order that the paperwork may be located or that the
                     branch may recall the customer in question.


53                   In the event that these enquiries do not identify the customer then Post Office can do no
                     more. There would be no case of a TC being sent to a branch. The understanding would be
                     that the branch had properly accounted for the deposit. It is a downstream issue that has
                     failed to ensure the bank updates the customer's account.


54                            The narrative for this response should also be validated with Greg Lewis in Financial
                              Services in respect of bank relationships.


55                   Aon Commission Creditor


56                   The largest amount taken to profit by far in the 4 years reported on is in respect of Aon. This
                     had nothing to do with branch accounting, it was wholly independent of whether branches
                     may have taken wrong payments from customers and it did not lead to any TC's.


57                   The client contract with Aon had complex pricing arrangements within it. This led to a
                     difference of opinion between Post Office and Aon as regards the commission which was due
                     from Post Office to Aon for policies sold.


58                   Post Office initially paid a lower amount based on the initial Excel based pricing model that
                     was developed for the new contract. However, further analysis revealed that additional
                     payments may need to be made. A separate paper is available on this.


59                   Post Office then posted an accrual for potential extra payments, but after wider commercial
                     negotiations with Aon, a lower amount was agreed. The residual value of the accrual was
                     therefore moved to Client Suspense and subsequently released to profit.

60                     Given that Post Office had previously taken a cautiously higher cost to P&L in anticipation of a
                       higher payment to Aon, the release (3 years later) effectively offset an earlier loss borne by the
                       company.


61 I                   There was no impact on Subpostmasters.

62 I INSERT EXAMPLE FROM ROD
       These examples support Post Office's general position that Subpostmasters are not
       disadvantaged by the operation of the Suspense Account if they act in accordance with Post
       Office's policies and procedures. It is recognised that these are only two examples but as can
       be seen above, the number of permutations and types of errors is vast. If Second Sight has
       concerns over the operation of the Suspense Account in relation to specific transactions or
       circumstances then Post Office will be happy to look into this in more detail.

       Suspense Account data

       As requested, enclosed with this paper is a spreadsheet showing all amounts taken from the
       Suspense Account into profit over the last 4 years. The figures in the spreadsheet include
       both "customer monies" and payments for services as described above. Each line item may
       represent a single unreconciled transaction or series of unreconciled transactions.
