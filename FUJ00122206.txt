Hi Graham,

I Have been asked by Brian to take on the responsibility of producing the witness statements regarding Powerhelp calls
logged on PO's that are under investigation. Please take a look at the attached which is a copy of the ws that I will be
posting to you regarding Gaerwen PO, The statement confirms that in my opinion none of the calls logged have any affect
on the data integrity.

If you have any questions please ring me..
