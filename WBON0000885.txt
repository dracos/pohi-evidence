Belinda, Chris

Please find attached the updated submission on the "test for mediation" and a comparison showing the changes from
the last version.

As discussed, I've removed reference to the flowcharts. These relate to the question of "who applies the test for
mediation?" rather than "what is the test for mediation?" We'll reference these charts later once we have JFSA's
position on the former question.

Chris â€” if you do get a chance to look at this, please could you urgently let us know that this is approved to be
submitted to Tony.

Kind regards
Andy
