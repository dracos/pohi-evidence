Subject: letter from M005 to PM
Attachment: M005 - DC. pdf
All,

Please find attached a letter from one of the Scheme applicants to the PM. It has copied widely including to Paula and
Tony Hooper. I will start working on a reply for Tony and Paula now (not decided whether either both would be
required yet but I will make a start now).

I will pass on to Tony under separate copy.

Regards

David
