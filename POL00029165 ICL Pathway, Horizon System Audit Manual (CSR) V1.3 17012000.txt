Manual

Abstract: This manual describes the Horizon Operational,
Operational Support and Commercial systems and data
flows in sufficient detail to enable members of the
Horizon Audit Community to understand them for audit
purposes.

It also addresses the appropriate Criteria of
Requirements 697, 699, 816 and 829 insofar as it
provides information relating to the composition of and
access to the ‘audit trail’ as defined in those
Requirements and its admissibility for PACE certification.

1 Introduction

This document is intended for the community of auditors who are involved in
auditing the Horizon system and describes Horizon so that auditors can
understand the business processes and data flows involved. It is structured
to lead the reader through Horizon so that a general level of understanding
and knowledge can be obtained. It does not set out to be an exhaustive
decomposition of the total solution.

It provides information in support of the Horizon system meeting
Requirements 697 (General - Audit: Access), 699 (General - Audit: Trail),
816 (POCL Applications - EPOSS: Audit) and 829 (General - Security:
Prosecution Support).

It is supported by a number of related documents that describe the
Operational Services audit trails [3][4][5], the relevant Commercial Systems
audit trails and the audit data itself [6] in more detail.

The business processes include all systems and services that make up
Horizon including :

Operational Services
a. APS - Automated Payments Service.
b. EPOSS - Electronic Point of Sale Service.

c. OBCS - Order Book Control Service, including OBCS Access Service
(OAS).

d. HSH - Horizon System Help Desk.
Operational Support Services

a. RED - Reconciliation Exceptions Database.

c. RDMC - Reference Data Management Centre.
Commercial Systems.

a. SLCA - Service Level Contract Administration.

Change Control is also included as any changes to any of the above
Services can only be achieved through the agreed Change Control process
which has its own audit trail of documentation associated with it.

The document describes how access to the ‘audit trail’ is achieved and
establishes a framework for joint working where this is deemed appropriate.

2 Scope
The information in this document is relevant to Horizon at Core System

Release, that being the named Release following BA withdrawal and
equivalent to the old New Release 2 (NR2).

3 Terminology

Each organisation that constitutes the Horizon Community of Auditors will
have their own set of standard definitions and terminology and their auditing
policies and practices will be defined and described in Audit Manuals.
However, there is some terminology that is specific to Horizon :

Audit Tracks Defined in [1] as “a record of activities made within a
subsystem for one or more of its interfaces.”

Audit Trail Defined in [1] as “one or more such tracks.”
In addition this document uses the following terms throughout :

POCL Post Office Counters Ltd. The organisation responsible
for operating the outlets through which Horizon will be
delivered to the end customer.

4.2

What is Horizon?

Background

Horizon was the total solution to the joint requirement of the Department of
Social Security and Post Office Counters Limited which asked for the
provision of a facility to transact most Post Office business and, in particular,
the payment of benefits on each PO outlet counter across the UK.

Following the withdrawal of the Benefit Agency from the contract on 24" May
1999 the Horizon solution was de-scoped to deliver Post Office services only.
However, the basic architecture and principles of Horizon have not changed
with BA’s withdrawal.

It achieves this through the provision of a number of SERVICES at the Post
Office Counter delivered via the logical SYSTEM componentry shown in

Figure 1.

The services available at Core System Release are :

e Order Book Control Service (OBCS) that ascertains the validity of a BA
order book before payment is made. Note that this is a Post Office Service
and subject to a separate contractual agreement between the Post Office
and DSS

« Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS) that enables PostMasters to
conduct general retail trade at the counter and sell products on behalf of
their clients.

4.3

« Automated Payments Service (APS) support for utility companies and
others who provide incremental payment mechanisms based on cards and
other devices.

Each service is separate but all are delivered through the system architecture
as shown in Figure 2. New services can be added simply by defining the
business requirement, designing and constructing the software and utilising
the existing architecture to deliver the service to the Post Office Counter.

Central Systems Overview

The central systems comprise substantial computers running large relational
databases with on-line access for the Help Desk service.

The central systems are responsible for:
e Receiving information from POCL and its clients

« Storing incoming information and in some cases using it to modify existing
information

e Transforming it into a format suitable for the counter applications

e Passing information to the counter applications via the distribution
mechanism

e Receiving information back from the counter applications via the
distribution mechanism

e Storing returned information
e Passing information back to POCL and its clients

e Summarising information into an appropriate format for management
information access

Distribution Mechanism Overview

The distribution mechanism takes one logical stream of information from the
central systems and fans it out to the almost 20,000 outlets across the UK.
Conversely, it receives input from the almost 20,000 outlets and funnels it in
to one logical stream.

Counter Systems Overview

The counter systems provide interactive support for all staff in every Post
Office and are capable of operating even if they lose their connection to the
centre. Other than in fallback mode all outlet transactions take place directly
through this facility and the result of every transaction is captured and
returned to POCL. The results of certain specific transactions are returned
directly to the DSS and others to automated payment clients of POCL.

If the counter system is not available for any reason the Post Office operates
in fallback mode whereby transactions are authorised on a case by case
basis by the Horizon System Helpdesk. On return of the counter details of
transactions made in fallback mode are input in bulk by the Post Master.

Most of the transactions that occur at the counter are unplanned in that
nothing exists to represent an individual transaction until a customer walks up
to the counter and asks for some service or product.

Horizon System Helpdesk Overview

This provides POCL outlet staff with a single point of contact for dealing with
all problems relating to the system procedures and the Horizon system
installed in outlets.

5 The Horizon Services & Systems

5.1. Diagramming Conventions

Within each Horizon Service, be it Operational or Operational Support a
number of business processes are enacted in order to deliver the required
customer interaction. Similarly the Pathway Commercial Systems initiate
business processes in order to deliver the required end product. Each
business process requires data to allow it to operate and generates data to
confirm the transaction and report the outcome.

Diagramming conventions have been used as shown as shown in Figure 3 :

Data Flow
Process = —

Data Store

iaman-03

Figure 3 : Diagramming Conventions
A process is an IT component that manipulates the data in some way.

An external entity is a component that sits outside the scope of the diagram
but communicates with a process within it. Conventionally, flows between
external entities are not shown, but in this case they are shown where they
add to the overall understanding of the diagram.

A data store is a mechanism which holds data in a persistent manner for a
significant amount of time. In this context significant means longer than the
processing time of the processes to which it connects. Thus transient data is
NOT held within a data store.

The data flow arrows indicate the nature and direction of the data between
processes, external entities and data stores.

The following sections provide a ‘Level 1’ decomposition of the various
business processes enacted at Core System Release (CSR). Each consists
of the data flow diagram for that element of the service and a brief resume.

ESNS transmit a single Control Notice for an Order Book. This Notice may be
to Stop or Impound an Order Book on next presentation, or to Purge existing
Control Notices from the Central and Local databases.

The Control Notice is compared with the Central CRN (Customer Reference
Number) database and a separate CN record generated for each Post Office
where the Order Book has been previously submitted. The FAD code is
added to the CN record and passed to TMS where the CN records are
distributed to each Post Office at which point they are added to the Local CN
database.

The Post Office receives a new Order Book (OBs may be received in
batches) from the Benefits Agency and is ‘accepted’ by the Post Master. Any
Control Notices that exists for the OB are applied after which the OB is either
available for collection by the beneficiary or is immediately impounded and
returned to the Benefits Agency.

Transactions confirming the actions taken are sent back, via TMS to OBCS.

A benefit claimant arrives at the Post Office with an appropriate form of

authority to pick up the new Order Book. This may be an expired OB or some

other form as notified to the claimant.

The Local CN database is checked to see if any Control Notices have been
received since the book was ‘accepted’ and if not, the OB is ‘activated’ and
handed to the beneficiary.

Transactions recording the result of the activity are sent back to ESNS via
TMS and OBCS.

Having obtained the new Order Book, or already being in possession of one,
the beneficiary wishes to encash one of the foils for a benefit payment.

The book is presented to the Post Master and the local CN database checked
for any Control Notices that should be applied. Depending on the outcome of
that check there could be one of three outcomes :

e The benefit is paid to the claimant and the book returned to him/her.
e The benefit is paid but the book is impounded afterwards.

e The book is impounded immediately and no benefit is paid.

Automated Payments enables members of the public to pay bills from various
utilities and other organisation who have a bill paying agreement with the
Post Office. It also allows for pre-payment of money against future use of a
utility.

The customer presents the utility bill or card and cash to the Post Master who
issues a receipt. Transaction details are sent to POCL HAPS at Farnborough
and POCL TIP at Chesterfield for subsequent processing and reconciliation
with their clients.

Resume

There will be times when the POCL Customers wishes to change or reverse
entirely an Automated Payment transaction made earlier. APS allows this to
happen as long as certain POCL Business Rules surrounding reversals are

met :

a. Transactions shall only be reversed in the office in which the original
transaction took place

b. A transaction cannot be reversed if it has been forwarded to POCL or
the Client

c. A transaction must be available for reversal until the end of business
day on which the transaction was performed

d. Eligibility for reversal is subject to the constraints of the token

technology of the transaction and the AP Client Specification

commence. If the rules applicable to the scheme have been met, and the
original transaction is still available to be reversed, it will be and the money
returned to the Customer. A second, Reversal Receipt, is produced by the

PO on behalf of another organisation, eg. DVLA car tax discs, or pure
consumer goods, eg. sweets. Only those goods that are identifiable on the
menu hierarchy may be sold in an outlet and this is controlled through the
transmission of reference data from the Post Office to the counter via the
Reference Data Management Centre.

Variable information about the products, eg, price. is also sent to the outlet

Horizon Operational Support Services

Reconciliation Exception Database (APS/EPOSS)

System Overview (APS)

The role of the BSU is to ensure that all APS transactions that occur at the
Post office counter reach the intended Clients. The transaction details must
pass across a number of system boundaries that may cause rejections (or
non-deliveries) which have to be progressed by the BSU with the assistance
of other ICL Pathway units.

The BSU will generate reports on those incidents and record them on the
BSU APS Reconciliation Exception Database (RED). Each new incident will
generate a RED report that is updated and ensures that an audit trail is
available for each incident.

The RED report is used for two reasons:

« to inform POCL Chesterfield and Farnborough of the details of the APS
transaction(s) which have been rejected (undelivered) and to give them the
correct transaction details so that they can be forwarded to the correct
Clients for settlement, and

e to inform POCL Chesterfield and Farnborough that the incident has been
cleared and, when agreed between ICL Pathway and POCL, closed.

There are potentially 6 types of incident that may be dealt with through RED
(APS) :

a. Incidents at ICL Pathway Central Systems

The APS Host prepares APS Transaction files for transmission to POCL
HAPS. The TPS Host prepares will also create AP Transaction files as well
as TPS Transaction files for TIP. The ICL Pathway Central Systems will
receive both sets of AP Transaction files and reconcile the two files on a
transaction by transaction basis. Files that pass validation are sent straight to
HAPS.

If there are any differences then these discrepancies are stored in the APR as
discrepancies.

b. Unmatchd Reversals

The ICL Pathway Host APS also checks to see that any reversed transactions
have a matching pair of transaction details i.e. that there is an original and a
reversed transaction.

If the Host APS has a reversed transaction to which it can not find the
original, then the reversal is rejected by the Host and put into an APS
exceptions table. Every entry that goes into this table causes an event to be
raised.

POL00029165

ICL Pathway Horizon System Audit Manual (CSR) Ref:IA/MAN/004
Version:1.3
Date:17/01/00

c. Incidents on APS Reconciliation Reports

The BSU will receive a number of APS reports from ICL Outsourcing (CFM)
everyday and these reflect the APS transactions that have occurred at Post
Offices using the APS during the previous business day.

This report shows the number and value of the APS transactions which have
been transferred to HAPS and to TIP for the previous business day. The
report will show any timing delay exceptions which are normally resolved the
following day. However, some exceptions are more than merely timing delays
in which case they become ‘Confirmed Exceptions’ and have to be resolved
by the BSU.

d. Incidents at HAPS Farnborough

HAPS receives AP transactions files from ICL Pathway APS daily. It carries
out a validation check on the files, merges the APS files with other Post office
transaction files (i.e. APT and ECCO transactions) and then sorts the
transactions by Client. The data collated enables POCL Farnborough to
inform the Clients of their transaction payments for the previous accounting
day.

HAPS may reject individual transactions if the Client ID details on those
transactions are not recognisable by the system.
e. Incidents at TP Chesterfield

POCL Chesterfield receives transaction data from the HAPS data stream and
the TPS data stream. The HAPS data must pass through a pre-APACHI
validation check before accepted by APACHI. The validation process checks
all the data details to ensure that the right payments go to the right Clients.

The system causes a number of transactions to appear duplicated which
would be picked up by the pre-APACHI validation check.

f. Incidents at the AP Client

AP Clients receive their APS payments from the Settlement team at POCL
Chesterfield on a daily basis.

There are two categories of Clients :
e Girobank who acts on behalf of a number of Utility and Service companies.
e Non-Girobank Clients whom POCL Chesterfield deals with directly.

The Public Customer may query their Utility bill with regards to payments
made at the Post office, e.g. a payment has been shown incorrectly or does
not appear on the Customer's bill.

The Customer will initially contact the AP Client with their query. The AP
Client may be able to resolve the query without taking the incident further.
However if the Client is unable to resolve the incident, then they will contact
POCL at Chesterfield and ask them to resolve the incident.

7.1.2 System Overview (EPOSS)

ICL Pathway is not responsible for directly reconciling EPOSS transactions.
There is an obligation to pass raw transaction data to POCL TP daily,
followed by a completed post office Cash Account on a (generally) weekly
basis. POCL are then responsible for reconciling the individual transactions
to the Cash Account totals to provide a national picture.

However, on occasions, due to system constraints, e.g. reversals being
prevented due to Cash Account roll over etc, an office may well submit a
Cash Account to POCL TP, which is known to be incorrect. In such cases,
POCL TP will require full details of the transaction in question to enable the
reconciliation and settlement or the error notice procedures to be effected. An
incident is therefore raised via the HSHD and passed to BSU who will
complete the appropriate RED entry advising POCL of the correct transaction
or settlement values.

7.2 Reference Data Management Centre

7.2.1

System Overview

The Reference Data Management Centre (RDMC) is a the mechanism which
receives reference data from both POCL and from within Pathway and
delivers it to the various parts of the Horizon system. RDMC includes

a.

Procedures to handle the receipt, validation and storage of reference
data

Change control facilities to manage the controlled release of reference
data to the Pathway system

Data transformation procedures which handle the ‘enrichment’ of
reference data into the format required by the Pathway Counter
Applications.

Delivery of reference data to the Pathway Counter Applications to
support the processing of EROSS and APS. EPOSS and APS counter
processing functionality is generic and the individual transactions are
driven to a great extent by reference data parameters

Delivery of reference data to other areas of the Pathway system such
as TPS, MIS and APR

RDMC does not support any BA reference data.

Type A Data

This reference data is delivered by POCL via a formally agreed interface.
The data consists of outlet, client, product and automated payment token
definitions. It is transferred from POCL to Pathway using FTMS.

RDMC processes each file of reference data delivered by POCL and returns
error details and process statistics to POCL via FTMS. FTMS will ensure all
data transfer information required for auditing is available for collection by the
Archive Server.

Type B Data

This consists of reference data which is supplied by POCL but was not
included in the formally agreed Type A interface — mainly because the
requirements for and / or the decision to supply the data was taken at a late
stage in the Release 2 design. The data consists of cash accounting
mappings, scales tariffs, product discount and product migration definitions.

Formal procedures are agreed with POCL to support the delivery of this data
from POCL to Customer Services. Customer Services then manages the
preparation of the data for input to RDMC with the support of Counter
Development.

An audit record is maintained by the archive server of all reference data files
received by RDMC and of the associated error details and process statistics.

Type C Data

This consists of reference data which Counter Development supply to
support the Pathway Counter application. The best example of this type of
reference data is the menu hierarchy definition. The data is delivered by
Counter Development to Customer Services.

Customer Services manage the loading of the data into RDMC. An audit
record is maintained by the archive server of all reference data files received
by RDMC and of the associated error details and process statistics.

Rollout Auto-Config Data

At a specific point in the automatic configuration of new POCL outlets, the
auto-config process sends details of the offices to be rolled out to RDMC by
creating data files in the RDMC environment. The data is loaded
automatically into RDMC where it triggers the delivery of reference data for
the newly rolled-out offices to other areas of the Pathway system.

An audit record is maintained by the archive server of all reference data files
received by RDMC and of the associated error details and process statistics.

Data Output Streams

Reference Data to Pathway Counter Applications

RDMC delivers new and changed reference data to the Pathway Counter
Applications via a Reference Data Agent process (R_LD_ALL). This process
reads generic views of the reference data within RDMC and extracts details
of reference data changes. The agent process then converts the data into
attribute grammar format for and delivers it to the Correspondence Server
level.

RDMC maintains a audit record of when each set of input data is delivered to
the Correspondence Server.

Delivery of Reference Data to Other Pathway Systems

RDMC delivers changes to outlet, client and product reference data to MIS
each day. An audit record is maintained by RDMC of when each set of input
data is delivered to MIS.

Additionally, RDMC provides an up-to-date view of outlet and client details to
the TPS and APR host system

Data Retention Requirements

RDMC operates as a fully replicated system across two sites offering
immediate resilience in the event of failure. Data is transmitted a number of
times each day between RDMC and the POCL RDS system at Huthwaite via
dedicated ISDN lines.

In the event of failure, fallback processors and links are in place.
Reference Data received from POCL into RDMC is retained for 18 months.

Service Level Contract Administration

Overview

SLCA, and its associated reporting system Service Level Agreement
Monitoring (SLAM) are used to compare the performance of the Horizon
system against a number of measures established in the contract Schedule
BO3. It does this by taking information feeds from the Data Warehouse (DW)
and running these against special formulae, again established in the contract.
SLAM is used to report the outcome of these calculations to the Horizon
Service Management Group, a Pathway/POCL committee.

Data Input Streams

Transaction Data (Automatic Feed)

Transaction timing data is taken by the TPS Harvester.
Helpdesk timings are taken from the Horizon Helpdesk.
File delivery times are taken from OBCS and APS.
Reference Data delivery times are taken from the RDMC.
All the above are held as Oracle tables within the DW.
Transaction Data (Manual Feed)

There are a number of manual data feeds into SLCA, all of which result in
Oracle tables within the DW, eg. Achievement of Rollout, achievement of
Training.

Standing Data

SLA parameters (as defined by the contract) are held as Oracle tables within
the DW.

Mathematical formulae used to calculate achievement (as defined in the
contract) are held as Oracle tables within the DW.

Changes to Standing Data

Changes to the SLA Parameters and mathematical formulae are allowed via
an Administration Facility within the SLCA system. Physical access to this
facility is strictly controlled and password controls are used to control logical
access.

Changes to the parameters and/or formulae require pre-authorisation through
the Change Control process before they can be applied. ACCN number must
exist for each change.

Records of changes to Standing Data, including Contract, Contract SLA,
Performance Measure and Liquidated Damages are maintained in an
AUDIT_DETAILS table within the Oracle database :-

e For each field in the Contract table created, amended or deleted a record
of the change.

e For each field in the Contract SLA table created, amended or deleted a
record of the change.

e For each field in the Performance Measures table created, amended or

Operational Audit Data Archive Server

Overview

Audit data generated at various points in the Horizon solution is gathered
periodically and placed on DLT for long term storage. Files containing audit
data are generated by the various applications and systems and are placed
into special directories established for audit purposes. These are periodically
polled by the Audit Track Gatherer and the files drawn down into the audit
archive server and placed on DLT.

The Archive Server can be decomposed to show its component parts and a
brief description of how they function. Figure 4 shows the basic componentry
and Figures 5 and 6 the data flows that take place between them for archiving
and retrieving audit data respectively.

10.2 Archiving and Storing Audit Data

10.2.1 Overview

Essentially the activity here is to Gather all audit data files that have been
placed into the appropriate directories, calculate a checksum seal value for
each file (establishing a data integrity control) and placing the sealed file onto
a DLT for storage

10.2.2 Audit Track Gatherer

Gathers Audit Tracks that have been generated within Horizon. The majority
of these tracks are created on different platforms and are gathered onto
temporary disk storage on the Archive Server.

Gathering is implemented using Windows NT remote disk access facilities for
Correspondence Server, Tivoli Object Database and External Gateway Audit
Tracks. NFS is used to collect files from Unix systems in particular the
database applications, e.g. OBCS. The Audit Tracks are gathered at regular
intervals. The Scheduling of the transfers varies with the type of Audit Point
and the locations from which the tracks are gathered and is controlled via the
Maestro scheduling facilities of Horizon.

Multiple instances of the Audit Track Gatherer can be configured on a single
Archive Server.

10.2.3 Audit Track Sealer

Before Audit Tracks are hoarded a seal is calculated for the file. The seal is
stored on the Archive Server in a database which links the seal to the file.

When an Audit Track is retrieved its seal is recalculated and checked against
the value in the database.

10.2.4 Audit Track Hoarder

Transfers Audit Tracks from the Disk Storage on the Archive Server onto long
term storage media (DLT tapes). This component is implemented using the
Legato NetWorker product.

10.2.5 Audit Track Deleter

The Audit Track Deleter is responsible for the deletion of Audit Tracks from
the machines on which they were generated after they have been gathered.
The point in the processing of an Audit Track (by the Archive Server) at which
the original copy of each gathered file is deleted is configurable. Audit Track
Deletion takes place between the completion of Audit Track Gathering and
some (configurable) time after the completion of Audit Track Hoarding for any
particular Audit Track file.

The Audit Track Deleter is also responsible for regularly producing a list of
files processed by the Archive Server.

ICL Pathway Horizon System Audit Manual (CSR) Ref:IA/MAN/004
Version:1.3
Date:17/01/00

10.3.1 Overview

This is where audit data is retrieved from the DLT, based on Request(s) For
Information made by Post Office Internal Audit, and presented for further
extraction or placed on CD-ROM or other suitable media for despatch to the
RFI originator.

The following paragraphs are ordered to reflect the actual processing of a
Request For Information (RFI) by ICL Pathway Internal Audit.

10.3.2 Request For Information

POIA will request audit data via Request For Information form (RFI). This will
contain a description, in business terms, of the times, outlets, events, items
and activities that the Auditors are interested in. This request has to be
interpreted by Pathway Internal Audit and mapped onto the Audit Points and
Files described earlier in this manual.

10.3.3 Marking Files and Tapes

Based on this interpretation as many files of audit data that are needed to
satisfy the request are ‘marked’ for retrieval. Legato is notified of these files
and it in turn identifies the DLTs containing these files. Legato provides
system prompts for Operators to load tapes and it copies the data into a local
buffer area.

10.3.4 Audit Track Retriever

Polls the Legato buffer area and retrieves any data files found into temporary
disk storage (Export File) on the Archive Server prior to the extraction of
relevant data for use by the auditors. The Retriever provides a second copy
of the file which is input to the Check Seal function.

10.3.5 Audit Data Check Seal
To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the DLT the checksum seal
for the file is re-calculated by the Audit Track Sealer (10.2.3) and compared

to the original value calculated when the file was originally written to the DLT.
The result is maintained in a Check Seal Table.

10.3.6 Audit Trail Extractor

This is a ‘catch all’ facility that uses various tools to extract or reform the
retrieved audit data in accordance with the RFI. It also places the information
onto a CD-ROM, or other suitable media, for despatch to the RFI originator.

10.4 Archived Audit Data Usage

The audit data maintained in the audit archive can be used for a number of
purposes :

e Proving processing integrity.

e Supporting or substantiating investigations.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Page 53 of 68
POL00029165
POL00029165

ICL Pathway Horizon System Audit Manual (CSR) Ref:IA/MAN/004
Version:1.3
Date:17/01/00

e ‘Bulk’ extraction.
10.4.1 Proving Integrity of Processing

To prove the integrity of a process during a regular System Audit. Data that is
available on the day(s) that the audit takes place can be used and may be
taken from the archive or direct from the system. Audits of this type are likely
to be run or led by Pathway Internal Audit.

10.4.2 Investigation Support

The term ‘investigation’ is used in its broadest sense and does not limit itself
to fraud. Any RFI is likely to be associated with a specific business event, eg.
An encashment, a bill payment, an outlet, a beneficiary. It is anticipated that
the majority of this type will be based on the TMS Journal, or will use it as a
start point. See section [11.2] for details of how to raise an RFI.

10.4.3 Bulk Extraction

Although the term ‘bulk extraction’ is used, the amount of audit data retrieved
may be relatively small. However, the underlying principle is that a chunk of
data will be extracted from the archive and despatched to the requester for
their further analysis. It is anticipated that the majority of this type will be
based on the TMS Journal although POIA may also request information from
other files (OBCS, etc). See section [11.2] for details of how to raise an RFI.

11.1

Obtaining Access to Operational Audit Data

Requirement 699.

Access Control Policy

The access to, and availability of, audit data is dependent on which audit role
requires it :

e ICL Pathway Auditor.

e POCL Auditor.

e POCL Emergency Manager.
e POCL <Client> Auditor.

e Authority’s Agents.

11.1.1 ICL Pathway’s Internal Auditors

ICL Pathway’s auditors, who will be based at the ICL Pathway Headquarters
in Feltham, can access the ICL Pathway datacentres, at Wigan and Bootle,
via secured links. They can also operate out of the Datacentres where this is
more convenient or appropriate.

When routed to a particular campus, the auditor will only be permitted to
access files at that site.

Access to Riposte Journals at the ICL Pathway central sites will avoid the
need to access the journals held at the Post Office outlets.

11.1.2 Post Office Auditors

POCL and POCL <Client> Audit functions will have access to:
e POCL SIS audit track (selective),

e POCL Client audit track (selective), and

e the Systems Management track.

Although classed as a single Audit role Post Office Auditors fall into two
categories, Post Office Network Auditors and Post Office Internal Auditors.
Network Auditors require access to audit trail information at the local sites.
This will account for the bulk of the day-to-day audit activity undertaken by a
large team of experienced auditors. Internal Auditors will usually satisfy their
audit trail information needs through Requests For Information made to the
Pathway Audit function.

Access to POCL audit trails, particularly the TMS Journal, is seen as a strict
POCL preserve. If any third parties require access to it, for evidential
purposes or fraud investigation, then the access will be via POST OFFICE
INTERNAL AUDIT.

Local Access

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Page 55 of 68
POL00029165
POL00029165

ICL Pathway Horizon System Audit Manual (CSR) Ref:IA/MAN/004
Version:1.3
Date:17/01/00

Network Auditors will use the same reporting functionality as provided to
support the Electronic Point Of Sale Service (EPOSS). This entails
production of various standard reports which the auditor may use instead of
the local Post Office Manager.

In addition to the standard EPOSS reports, Network Auditors have access to
a suite of special reports and logs available to them via a special
authentication process including a one-shot password.

The “events” of interest will be non-transactional activities which have
ongoing significance, including:

e user log-on/off,

e stock unit allocations/transfers/remittances,
e unauthorised access attempts, and

« change of access permissions.

Central Access

In exceptional cases, Network Auditors may require access to this information
held centrally via the audit archive. This would apply:

e following equipment loss or damage at the local outlet,

« where an operational system is not expected to be re-established during
the day of the auditor's visit, and

e if it is necessary to view an historical record.

Network Auditors will not be allowed direct access to information outside the
POCL OPS domain and any information needed will be supplied to them by
the Internal Auditors who will themselves obtain it via the ICL Pathway
Auditors.

11.1.3, POCL Emergency Manager

In exceptional circumstances, the Post Office Manager:
«® may not be available (as a result of death or injury), or
may not provide co-operation (when under fraud investigation).

In such cases, an auditor may need to reassign roles to new users and reset
access permissions following transfer of business from one Post Office
Manager to another.

The POCL Emergency Manager role can be used by selected PO Auditors
when they require additional capabilities in the absence of a Post Office
Manager. It provides the normal auditor functions plus the Post office
Manager functions, including user administration.

The POCL Emergency Manager may delete and create a Post Office
Manager Role and produce a cash account for a broken period.

Version:1.3
Date:17/01/00

11.1.4 POCL <Client> Auditors

There is no direct access to the system by POCL <Client> Auditors. Post
Office and ICL Pathway’s Auditors will access the system on their behalf and
provide all necessary information that the POCL <Client> Auditors are
permitted to see. They are expected to operate through the PO Internal
Auditors.

11.1.5 Authority’s Agents
Schedule A03 identifies other parties that may be granted audit rights to
Pathway and/or the Horizon system. They are :
e External auditors of the Authority.
e Other authorised agents.
« Successor organisations to those identified above.

Access by any of these organisations must be co-ordinated in the first
instance by the Authority for whom the Agent is operating and the
requirements of the JWF should, where possible, be observed.

11.1.6 One Shot Passwords

One Shot Passwords (OSP) are transacted through the Horizon System
Helpdesk (HSH) and are available to POCL Post Masters, selected Retail
Network Managers and Network Auditors. Each request for an OSP will result
in a verification dialogue with the HSH and, potentially a Service
Management Centre supervisor.

Details of the OSP can be found in the document ‘Authentication of User for
Release of One Shot Password by Horizon System Helpdesk’, reference
PCL/BSM/SEC/001 v1.2 dated 09/12/99.

11.2 Requesting Audit Data Extractions

11.2.1 Pre - Requisites

Post Office Internal Audit will be expected to identify Auditors who are
authorised to raise an RFI. It is not anticipated that this list will exceed two
names.

It is the responsibility of Post Office Internal Audit to notify Pathway Internal
Audit of any changes to this list.

11.2.2 Requesting Audit Data
All requests for audit data extractions must come to Pathway Internal Audit in

the form of a Request For Information. This is a free format request but must
contain a minimum of the following :

a. Originator identity (name, address, contact ‘phone)
b. Priority; Urgent (<48hours); Routine (<5 days); Other (Specify)

Commercial Audit Records (R697)

Requirement 697 Criteria 1 :

The CONTRACTOR and his sub-contractors shall keep or cause to be kept
Records (including financial records) of all Services, covering materials and
Services provided, timesheet records, contracts let to sub-contractors and
Charges levied to the AUTHORITIES. These Records shall not be more
detailed than those held by the CONTRACTOR for its own audit purposes.

Included Items

12.1.1 Invoicing Records

System Overview

Although the generation of an Invoice is a manual activity, and the core
Invoice values and frequencies are determined by the Contract between
POCL and ICL Pathway, there are a number of variable elements that are
applied to each Invoice :

e Transaction volumes where the actual transaction count is compared to a
benchmark value and an adjustment factor calculated.

e Outlet availability during the Invoice period.

e Numbers of outlets actually rolled-out during NRO compared to original
target.

e Liquidated damages arising from failures to achieve SLA commitments.
The Contract also allows for RPI adjustments.

Interim, or ad-hoc, invoices can be generated at any time although these do
not become committed and are used for internal reporting purposes only.

b. The scope of access to records identified as ‘included’ must be agreed

as part of agreeing Terms of Reference for an audit as described in the
Joint Working Framework.

It is possible that records and/or documents will be identified during an audit
that were not included in the original Terms of Reference. Pathway Internal
Audit will facilitate the release of these records and/or documents through the
appropriate channels subject to the records not being on the ‘Excluded’ list.

13.1

Obtaining Access to Commercial Audit Data &
Records

Requirement 697.
Access Control Policy

Access to audit data defined as ‘Commercial’ under Requirement 697 is
limited to that data which forms part of those Pathway systems of direct
interest and relevance to POCL. These are currently the Common Charging
System, Service Level Contract Administration and Service Level Agreement
Monitor.

Access to non-IT records that contribute to the Commercial audit trail will only
be available during audits conducted in accordance with the Joint Working
Framework. Access will be restricted to those records that are germane to the
provision of Services under the contract.

It is not anticipated that Post Office Internal Audit will request Commercial
audit data extractions in isolation but will seek to conduct joint audits with
Pathway Internal Audit into this aspect of the Horizon business. Joint audits
should be conducted in accordance with the Joint Working Framework.

14.2

Conducting Joint Audits

General

Requirement 697 provides for access to ICL Pathway’s premises, facilities,
Services, documentation, information, staff, procedures, timesheets and other
data in those areas that are directly involved with the operation of POCL
Services and associated systems, by auditors from the Post Office or their
representatives. Other external auditors, including POCL<Client> auditors,
are expected to deal with Pathway via PO Internal Audit respectively.

From ICL Pathway’s perspective the term Joint Working applies to all levels
of involvement from members of a fully integrated audit team to merely
hosting external auditors and facilitating visits to ICL Pathway locations. It
also covers audits that may be undertaken into Commercial or Operational
activities.

Each audit organisation will operate to its own detailed audit processes and
standards within a framework that enables joint agreement on planned audits,
terms of reference for audits and the sharing of audit reports and results.

Joint Working Framework

The Schedules AO3 establish the contractual framework for the conduct of
audits by the Authority or their Agents. The JWF provides a working
interpretation of the Schedules but does not superceeded or make redundant
any part of them as a result.

14.2.1 Planning

Joint audits can be planned or unplanned although the majority are expected
to be planned. Where PO Internal Audit anticipate conducting audits within
Pathway they would normally build them into their respective Audit Plans and
notify Pathway Internal Audit.

Similarly, where the ICL Pathway Audit Plan identifies an area where
complementary audits by the Post Office could improve the value of the audit
they will be encouraged to support the Pathway activity with resource
managed either by ICL Pathway or by themselves.

Accepting that some audits may be unplanned every effort must be given to
providing adequate notice, say 3 months, of an impending visit.

14.2.2 Terms of Reference

Whether planned or unplanned Terms of Reference must be established for
any Joint or External Audits and agreed by all parties. The ToRs may be
supported by detailed schedules to be agreed nearer to the start date of the
audit. The Terms of Reference should contain at least the following
information :

e Scope of work to be undertaken.

e Proposed dates for the audit and initial schedule.

e Proposed resources for the audit.

e Details of any site visits to be undertaken as part of the audit.
e Reporting arrangements for the audit.

Once agreed the Terms of Reference should be shared and agreed with the
auditee.

14.2.3 Detailed Audit Schedules

Depending on the nature and scope of the proposed audit it may be
necessary to establish and agree Detailed Audit Schedules. Again these
should be shared with the auditee, especially if the scope of the audit is in
any way restricted or special arrangements for site visits and personnel
interviews have to be made.

14.2.4 Resources

It is anticipated that adequate resources will be provided to conduct the audit.
Where an audit crosses domain boundaries, eg. if an end-to-end audit of an
Horizon service was being conducted, Post Office or Pathway resources will
be allocated to specific tasks within their own area to protect commercial
sensitivity.

14.2.5 Reporting Arrangements

There is likely to be sensitivity over the reporting arrangements, especially
the extent to which audit reports and findings are disseminated within
organisations. To avoid difficulty it is imperative that agreement on this
subject is reached during the establishment of the Terms of Reference and
has the full support of the auditee.

14.2.6 Corrective Actions Review

After an agreed period, established in AO3 as 30 days, a Corrective Action
Plan will be established identifying how instances of non-compliance will be
rectified and how audit recommendations will be addressed. The CAP will
establish timescales for implementation and these will be monitored as part of
the ongoing review of the audit results by the participating audit group.

14.2.7 Process Review and Improvement

At the end of each Joint Audit the lead auditors from participating group
should arrange to conduct a Post Audit Review to assess performance and
areas for improvement. The views of the auditee will be taken into account.
