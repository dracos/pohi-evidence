As discussed, I have included some suggested amendments to and comments on the table (attached). Do let me know if
you would like to discuss any of them.

I would agree that we should only comment in the table where we are currently comfortable we can support the position
taken and otherwise put a marker down and/or indicate investigations are ongoing and respond properly in due course.

I will get back to you shortly with further comments on the letter.
Kind regards

Jonathan

Herewith the latest version. It’s clean and only tweaked slightly from when you commented. Would you be happy to
have another run through, when you have had a chance also to look at the table. My aim would be to only comment in
the table on those matters where we are easily able to do so because we have provided the information before and just
put a marker down for the rest.

Best wishes
Belinda
