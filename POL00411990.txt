Observing the Code

Post Office has high standards and our customers,
clients, colleagues and shareholders have an

expectation that they will be treated professionally.

‘We all have a responsibilty to promote the Business Standards and
managers should help and encourage their teams to understand and
observe the Code. The Code forms part of our company rules which
you must adhere to as part of your employment.

The Code is also meant as guidance when dificult situations arise.

We all, at some time in our working lives, confront dilemmas about
whether an action is right. If you are faced with a dilemma:

Read the relevant parts of the Code

‘Ask yourself whether you could justify your action to your
manager. your colleagues and your own conscience

Think through the likely results of your action for yourself
and others

If you are still unsure what isthe right thing to do,
talk to your manager.

If you discover that the company’s standards and reputation are being
put at risk by unethical or even criminal behaviour, you should report
the facts to a manager. Ignoring bad behaviour is wrong - it can be
detrimental to our colleagues, and damage the perception of our brand
by our customers, clients and partners. If you feel you can't talk to your
own manager, you should talk to a senior manager, or contact the HR
helpline. Of course, we realise it isn't always easy reporting unethical
(criminal behaviour. If you have any concerns and want to speak to
someone confidentially, please contact the Speak Up line on 0800 048
‘4531. Please be aware that any breach of this Code may be dealt with
under our Conduct Code, and that gross misconduct could result in
your dismissal. (Help: Employee Assistance on 0800 6888 777)

Our Brand

For any organisation competing in today’s
fast-paced world, there’s nothing more vital
than a powerful brand. And if that brand is
clear, relevant, engaging and has a purpose,
more and more people will interact with it.
‘With people like you completely behind it, the Post Office
brand will be just that.

# We have a brand that must run through everything
we do: our products and services; environments;
behaviours: communications: and the way we manage
our people

It builds on our heritage and strengths and helps us stay
relevant for our customers in a fast-changing digital world.

We are the brand. We need to live it to deliver
consistently for our customers,

By brand, we don’t just mean a logo, a certain set of colours
anda strapline. We mean the services we provide; the way
we deliver them; the perceptions of those who use us, and
of course the people like you who represent us. We mean
the way we do business.

‘So, what does our brand say to people? What does
it promise?

We're here to help make the important things in life happen
for our customers. We make it easy, as life is complicated
enough. Whether it's sending money for a loved one’s
birthday, calling them to show you care, travelling to far-
flung places, or getting your broadband connected, we
remove the stress and complexity of sorting them.

To make our brand strategy succeed we
need engaged and high performing people.

Our experience needs to be shaped by our core values of
Care, Challenge and Commit. We make that happen by
having a set of straightforward business behaviours which
inform the way we do things.

We use them to improve things like our people processes.
such as recruitment, learning and development, talent,

and performance management. In short, it’s how we do
things in this business so we deliver our brand consistently
to customers,

Customer Excellence

Our customers are at the heart of
everything we do. We all know
what good customer service is and
there are hundreds of examples of
us all delivering it every day.

Our challenge now is to make sure we deliver great
service for every customer, every time. The more we
understand our customers and their expectations, and put
ourselves in their shoes, the easier it will be to provide
consistently great service.

(Our Customer Promise is to make the important things in
life happen for them, There's nothing that beats the buzz of
achieving the important things in life, whether that’s getting
that dream house, starting a business, or even just relaxing on
that well-earned holiday. And yet. accomplishing the important
stuff in life can be fraught with complexity, which can cost our
customers time, effort and added stress.

The more we understand our customers
and their expectations, and put ourselves in
their shoes, the easier it will be to provide
consistently great service.

‘You may ask, what does this mean for each one of us?
How can we at Post Office make sure we fulfil the
Customer Promise?

‘We can help our customers focus on the important things
by removing the stress of sorting them.

* We connect with our customers on an emotional level

Wee listen first, and fully understand their needs
and expectations

We talk respectfully, leaving out the jargon to give them
the best advice that meets their expectations, to achieve
their goals

We always think about the customer and not
the process

We make it simple, straightforward and quick to reach
Us. in branch, online, on mobile

We always focus on the Service before anything else

We give the best possible experience, each time

Everyone is responsible for putting the customer first

Service excellence is an attitude engrained in everyone
at Post Office. Our customers have to be at the heart of
everything we do.

A good example of this approach in action is with
Post Office Money and FACE - the Financial Service
‘Customer Experience programme from Post Office. FACE is
an acronym that stands for Fair and Transparent, Accessible,
‘Committed and Easy.

Under the new regulatory regime, driven by the Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA), Financial Services is focused
much more on understanding and meeting our customers’
needs rather than simply working on meeting a range of
‘compliance measures. This increased focus looks at how
‘we deal with our customers and address issues that could
potentially harm or disadvantage them. There is also an
increased emphasis on the post-sale process, Post Office
Money has developed FACE to keep us abreast of the
changes we are making to improve the overall customer
‘experience, gain input from across the business and
challenge us all to live up to our customer values in all our
dealings with our customers.

Our People

Our people are our biggest asset.
Post Office is nothing without people.
They provide the human touch that
forms the central part of our vision.

It's you and your colleagues who make things happen - for
customers, for clients, for each other, and for our business.
‘And it's you who can make great things happen

We should always ensure we are all delivering the best
possible customer experience, while at the same time giving
everyone within our business the chance to fulfil their
potential and enjoy a varied, challenging and rewarding career.

We need you to take ownership of the part you play, but
also work as a team and support your colleagues when
they need it. Always put yourselves in your customers’
shoes and think about what else you can do to improve
their experience. Speak up when you think there is a better
way of doing something - don't be afraid to challenge
convention and inject new ideas.

We have high standards of personal behaviour and respect
for everyone at all times. We create a culture where
everyone is able to give their best at all times.

We are open, honest and courteous with each other at all
times. We challenge any instances we encounter of bullying,
intimidation, harassment, unlawful discrimination or abuse
of any kind and we report any instance to our line manager,
or via the confidential Speak Up support line. We show that
such behaviour has no place whatsoever in Post Office.

We do not exploit colleagues for loans, private work or
favours of any kind nor abuse others in speech, writing,
social media or electronic communications. Our behaviour
supports our excellent service to customers, it enhances
‘our reputation. Any behaviour that damages our brand

is unacceptable, including lateness, poor attendance,
dishonesty. drunkenness, use of illegal substances, violent
or disorderly behaviour, and abusive language. Gambling is.

colleagues at Post Office. We should appear professional

in our appearance, therefore we expect people to wear

items used in body piercing) and tattoos should not be
offensive, a health and safety risk or incompatible with
being professional

part of the community, we respect
our customers and we are easy to do
business with

Valuing Equality and Diversity

in which we live and work, and the customers we serve.

We expect everyone in the business to play his or her part
in bringing this to life. Everyone has a responsibility to make
both a personal commitment and set a standard for others
to follow.

communities where we live and operate.

Our suppliers

‘We ensure that suppliers are aware of our standards and
‘expectations of their practices in diversity. We seek to use
agencies or companies who have clear values on equality,
of opportunity and diversity. And we establish procedures
to encourage businesses from diverse communities to
compete for contracts

‘We value the diversity of our customers and employees,
and are committed to being inclusive at all times. When

it comes to language, the common language of business
should be English (English or Welsh in Wales). However, as
long as it doesn’t jeopardise the job or health and safety and
it doesn't deliberately exclude people, then workers should
be able to speak their own language within reason.
