As I think Claire has already flagged to you, we have now spoken to Jo about the letter to James Arbuthnot MP.
regarding the Post Office Horizon system.

Please find attached a revised version which includes Jo’s changes, plus the additional paragraph of information I sent
up on Friday. I attach a clean version ready to be formatted, and one with the tracks showing so you can draw SoS’
attention to the changes.

It would be good if this letter can go out ASAP, please. Note that the letter is to be copied to the PM, DPM and Adrian
Bailey MP.

For your information, we are also revising slightly the letter from Jo Swinson to Mr Alan Bates to address a specific
point he raised — we plan to issue that in the next day or so (I am waiting for some clarification from Post Office).

Do let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks

Laura
