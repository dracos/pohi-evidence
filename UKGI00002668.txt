Subject: RE: DRAFT Q&A

Patrick - I think this is a really excellent first draft. I think the tone is right and there is a good balance of detail vs
clarity/"punchiness".

Some of the answers are a bit long or might need a bit of reordering to get the main thrust of the response in the first or
second line but overall I am very happy with these. Please continue in this vein, I look forward to the remaining
questions.

Just from the point of view of version control, shall I wait for the rest of the answers to be populated before I start
tweaking. When might I get the next draft. Realistically I will get to it on Sunday not Saturday if that's any help (or not, I

appreciate no one likes to work the weekend, least of all me!).

P.s. My main man Peter is leaving, and he was great at lines. Do you want a job @

Dear Richard
We spoke, albeit with difficulty.

As promised, here is a DRAFT of where we are up to on the Q&A you requested for JS.

I must stress that this is a draft and that we are still working on it. However, if you have the time to take a look and
provide any comments, that would obviously be much appreciated.

Kind regards
Patrick
