Applicant’s Response to Mediation Scheme

The Applicant complains of
e Inadequate training provided by Post Office.
e Disputed discrepancies.
e Unhelpful and negative communications (Helpline, Auditors and subsequent
Investigators).
e Hardware problems.
e Investigative processes flawed
e Amounts claimed by Post Office are disputed

4.

Analysis

The Applicant was in position from 5" May 2005 to 14" February 2008

e The POL conclusion is that the cause of any errors are as a result of human
intervention — either accidental or deliberate and a disregard of procedural controls
Unless this position is resiled from this case should not cause any problems with any
POL prosecutions past or pending.

5.

Dangers to Post Office Limited

e This case did not result in a prosecution or a conviction. It is unlikely to affect any
criminal cases conducted by POL, past present or future unless some concession is
made about the integrity of Horizon which from the robust POL response seems
unlikely
