Belinda

We spoke. We recently received a letter from Alan Bates of the JFSA regarding the mediation scheme.
Owing to the nature of the Scheme (overseen by an independent Chair) and the content of the letter (which
commented on operational matters) we have sought agreement from Alan Bates to share his letter with
POL00116507
POL00116507

both Sir Anthony Hooper and POL so that they may respond to Alan Bates directly. Please see attached a
copy of Alan Bates letter, and the Minister's response. A formal letter from the Minister to both Sir Anthony
and Paula will be issued shortly.

Best wishes
Peter

Thank you for sending through the response to my letter and I have no objection to my letter being

circulated to whomever you wish. I will be circulating content similar to that of my letter to the Minister
to all the MPs who have constituents in the Scheme in the near future anyway.

Many thanks for a prompt response
