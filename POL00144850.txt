Dear Mr Mistry
Re Branch Discrepancies

Thank you for your assistance in helping us to understand the unexplained
discrepancies that have impacted your branch.

1 I In light of these discrepancies Post Office has thoroughly investigated your
branch's records and, whilst undertaking this investigation, we have
ensured that any known discrepancies have not been charged to your
account. I write now to confirm the outcome of our investigations.

I can confirm that losses of £9,799.88 declared at TP10 in 2012 and 2013

2 I were not proper to your branch. This preblentissue was created by a
specific set of circumstances dating back to an actual loss you declared in
December 2010 (TP9).

In brief, the stock unit that declared the discrepancy and placed it into
Local Suspense was deleted on or before 10" December 2010. The
related Local Suspense entry should also have been removed, but this did
not happen.

The impact of this was that the loss of 2010 was picked up again at the
beginning of TP10 the next year in Horizon. At the end of TP10 the
branch was forced to clear this along with current discrepancies. The
Local Suspense ledger in the Post Office Finance System was impacted in
the same way.

This scenario was then repeated at the same point the next year.
Both TP10 discrepancies recorded at your branch were settled centrally
and blocked on your Customer Account.

The values of 2 * £9,799.88 have been cleared from your Customer
Account. The actual discrepancies that were proper to your branch were a
gain of £72.47 in 2012 and a loss of £39.57 in 2013. This leaves a net
gain of £32.90. This amount will be returned to you in May’s pay.

3 Changes to Horizon in 2011 prevented this preblestissue for stock units
deleted after mid-December 2010, and the old Local Suspense entry has
now been removed from the system.
