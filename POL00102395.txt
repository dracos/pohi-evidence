I wanted to update you on Sparrow.

Second sight’s final report is due to be sent to applicants to the mediation scheme on Tuesday or
Wednesday.

The report has significant inaccuracies and misunderstandings. It will therefore be accompanied by a Post
office rebuttal.

We will send a summary of the key points on Monday. Some of you have been involved in preparing our
response.

We are considering options in communications terms. The Second Sight report will undoubtedly be leaked
and used selectively. We may therefore propose proactively publishing it, removing the potential for
leak, with our response. There are pros and cons to this approach which I will discuss with Jane and
colleagues on Monday. A key element will be - as always with this issue - seeking to minimise external
noise and avoid unsettling the branch network.

I wanted though to give you this heads up as it is clear that whatever approach we take this week it will
lead to some negative news coverage in the media.

I will continue to update you with Jane over the next few days
Mark
