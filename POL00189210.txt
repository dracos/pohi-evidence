Wow... Croatia? Are you trying to get far enough away that the shockwave
won't impact?

Seriously, it's all getting a bit heated, not least because of the need to
disclose those two Horizon ‘defects’ (Gareth Jenkins calls them 'bugs' in
his report) that impacted 77 sub post offices and resulted in some SPMRs
"being asked to make good an incorrect amount" (wording from Gareth's
23/06/13 report sent to us).

The problem is that, in answer to James' question (which he is bound to
ask): "Have you (2nd Sight) found any instances of a defect in Horizon that
led to a shortages for which any SPMR was held accountable?” The answer
might not be "No"... but, in any event, POL has disclosed two software
defects that did have that effect, albeit POL dealt with them very properly
and wrote off the differences that had arisen. That correction process

looks to have taken over a year in regard to the differences arising from

one of the defects, however.

We are also still trying to bottom out the Rudkin matter and that looks as
though it will go to the wire.

Best regards, Ron
