1. Introduction

This report is produced by the PDA Operational Service Management team and provides
a high level “in-flight” assessment of any threats to overall Business Continuity in the
Congo 4 live service environment. The primary purpose is to identify any issues (actual
or potential) that might threaten the Congo 4 roll-out or regression from ICL Pathway
services.

The next ‘the interim OSM service report’ is scheduled for 13 February 98.

For ease of reference, the report utilises a traffic light system with the following keys -

Immediate Threat to Business Continuity

Potential Threat to Business Continuity

©

The ‘traffic lights’ in section 5 of this report should be interpreted in respect of the
perception to the ‘end users’ and how it will impact their environment.

No Threat to Business Continuity

4. End to End Business Continuity
Though the recent incidents involving the failure of Payment Authorisation and
Customer Detail files have been resolved as far as the customer perspective is concerned
and awaiting a Post Incident Review, there are still serious concerns over the volume of
inactivated payment cards issued to customers which is still occurring. A software fix is
+ being sought after as a matter of some urgency.
However, it should be stressed that although there has been many concerns in recent
weeks, a great deal of work has been undertaken by all domains to resolve or minimise
the impact of the problems.
Therefore the expectation is that the ‘BPS’ category should return back to yellow within
the next month.

structure /PAS : Security I. ing

The BES category shown in the Business Continuity report has now been changed to
BPS (benefit payment system), in this report, as it is believed this best describes this
category.

5.1 INFRASTRUCTURE

Release 1c Printers

A software fix has now been developed by ICL Pathway and is currently undergoing
operational tests. Initial reaction from ICL Pathway staff is very favourable and it is
predicted that this will cure the problem once-it has been implemented into the ‘live’
environment.

5.2 BPS & CAS/ PAS

Payment & Customer Detail File Failure

The customer impact for the aforementioned file failures has been resolved and both
incidents are awaiting a full post incident review scheduled for Wednesday 04 February
1998. .

Additional measures have been agreed between ICL Pathway and CAPS to prevent
. further instances of ‘lost’ files. CAPS will make a daily scan to establish which files
they have not had retuned successfully and the journal would be tidied to ensure failed

eo OPERATIONAL SERVICE MANAGEMENT

file transfers could be retumed quickly. ICL Pathway will ask CAPS/EDS for positive
confirmation of which files had failed and request manual re-sends.

Lost Transactions

There has now been 46 lost transactions, 8 of which resulted in duplicate payments
being made with a total value of £254.75. The responsibility and liability for these
payments lies with ICL Pathway.

ICL Pathway’s preferred option for resolving this problem, is to enforce the
commitment of transactions at the point of terminal time-out. The disadvantage of this
approach is that there is a chance that a transaction is forcibly committed although the
clerk intended to void the transaction. If this were to happen then a repudiation would
inevitably be made by the beneficiary who would be initially denied payment because
the system had falsely registered an encashment. Historical data suggests void
transactions are minimal. .

Further analysis is in progress to determine whether there is any impact on other
processes and a Change Proposal will be submitted to secure final approval from BA
and POCL.

Payment Card Activation

There has been continued occurrences of incorrectly activated payment cards at the Post
Office / ChB customer interface, which if allowed to continue will seriously undermine
the credibility of the ‘Horizon’ system with its target customers.

Changes have been identified which, when implemented, will modify the prompts at
card activation and check for confirmation of the operator’s intention should the process
be incomplete. ICL Pathway will raise a CRN for impact by POCL

Asan immediate work around, OSM has requested that all card enabled Post Offices
retain the PUNs at the card activation stage, for one month, this will be a contingency
to correct any inactivated cards when next presented.

Correspondence Server Failure
A technical review of the recovery process has been carried out and recommendations
are to be published shortly, with a full rehearsal and operational test to be scheduled at

Bootle.

ICL Pathway will be discussing the status of all recovery processes at a service review
on 26 January 1998 with CFM Operations.

OPERATIONAL SERVICE MANAGEMENT

Incorrect Cash Account Weeks

The proposed software fixes applied to the system on 10 January were tested out on two
(ex IGL) Post Offices. At this point it reported the fix was not functioning.

However, on the 15 January a Post Office communicated that a weekly report had been
successfully completed. Another test was run on 20 January, which proved to be
successful. Further test have now been proposed for 21 January, if successful the Post
Offices will be asked to resume weekly reporting.

It would appear the failure on 10 January may have been erroneous, this is being
investigated further.

Late Polling of Release 1c Post Offices

The monitoring of outlet polling to the data centres has now been improved with all
connections checked on a daily basis and a report produced of outlet ‘end-of-day’
messages. ICL Pathway have agreed to notify OSM of any Post Office which has not
harvested for two days, this in tum will be cascaded to all interested domains within
CAPS and POCL. At release 2, this process will be automated.

Complaint from a Housebound Disabled Customer

A house bound disabled customer who’s order book is to expire on 26 January, has
complained to the local BA office, having received her PUN to collect her new payment
card she realises there is no facility for an ‘Agent’. BA subsequently offered the ACT
facility, however the customer stated that she will still have the same problem of
gaining access to her monies. The customer has complained that the ‘level of service
has gone down and that her and other disabled customers are persecuted and penalised.
The customer has stated that she will write to her MP.

This particular customer will be regressed to an order book. CAPS COLS are resolving
the issue.

5.3 ABED
In general the have not been any reduction in the areas giving reason for concem noted
in the previous interim report. However, with the scheduled software fixes to the
aforementioned problems and the positive initiatives from respective POCL regions, it is
hopeful that improvements are to be seen in the next few weeks.

PDA Fraud & Security are to have a meeting with ICL Pathway to perform a risk
assessment of the problem of ‘Authentication of users to the PCHL’. Further details will
be reported in the next Interim Business Continuity report.

6. BES: Volumetrics

Definitions for the purpose of this report.

A transaction is a broad description of a customer session.

A payment is the Child Benefit allowance money due for one week, or for four weeks ( in case of
a four- weekly allowance).

An encashment is a measure of the work effort in a customer session from the clerk accepting the
payment card to returning the card with monies, i.e. one customer is paid all due Child Benefit
allowance. Thus, a customer may save several payments before visiting their PO. During such a
transaction there will be one encashment of several payments.

APPENDIX ‘A?
BROUGHT FORWARD my :
Two incidents were brought forward: the marooned stops and the Bath Road duplicate
due to a failed recall/re-issue for Mrs. Feist. Both remain unresolved at 31 December.
RELEASE 1C STATISTICS AND SETTLEMENT ADJUSTMENTS
There were 29 new reconciliation incidents. All were cleared. One was a failed recall /re-
issue (a “Known Problem”). Pathway wrongly authorised one payment that was not
available on the system (due to card not activated) when the customer complained.
Pathway has undertaken to refund £180.60 to POCL and £11.05 to BA as a result.

GENERAL RECONCILIATION PERFORMANCE
General performance of reconciliation work remained good as volumes increased.

IMPROVEMENTS:

. the monthly operational review meeting will be fed by routine reconciliation
summary reports;

. PDA Service Management will run the meetings in future;

. software fixes are scheduled for January to clear and prevent “marooned stops”

and to correct Common Basis of Settlement Reporting errors.

CONCERNS:
. absence of the agreed, apparently critical, CPCS:PAS interface File Summary, .
Report and that its absence was not noticed in testing or live running;
. Christmas / New Year holiday resourcing proved inadequate in more than one
area and all operational parties must ensure full support is available in future.
. a process must be established for agreeing fixes that impact service behaviour
or to agree that a fix does not impact behaviour.
. the overall exception rate (1 per 233 encashments) remains a concern if scaled up
to full Release 1c volumes (factor 25) and an issue if scaled to full roll-out (factor
thousands).
