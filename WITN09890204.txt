Dear Mr Regan,
Freedom of Information Request — FOI2021/00353

Iam writing in response to your email received by Post Office Limited (“Post Office”)
on 23 April, which I am dealing with under the terms of the Freedom of Information
Act 2000 (“FOIA”).

In your email you have requested the information shown in bold below. I can confirm
that Post Office does hold the information you have requested.

I would like to know when the last time Post Office attempted a prosecution.

Post Office Limited last prosecuted an individual in 2019. This prosecution was not
branch related and did not relate to or rely on any evidence from Horizon.

I would also like to know the last time a Sub-postmasters unwilling or unable
to make good any reported shortfalls was prosecuted.

Post Office Limited’s prosecution records are incomplete. It is not possible to
determine in any given case whether the person who was prosecuted was unwilling or
unable to make good a shortfall, nor when the last such circumstances arose. The
last time a postmaster was prosecuted by Post Office Limited in relation to a shortfall
identified within their branch was 2015. Post Office Limited does not know, however,
whether any postmasters have been prosecuted in relation to shortfalls at their branch
by any other prosecuting entity (e.g. the Crown Prosecution Service) subsequent to
2015.

If you have any queries about this response, please contact me. Do remember to
quote the reference number above in any future communications.

I hope the information I have provided on this occasion is useful, however if you are
dissatisfied with the handling of this response, you do have a right to request an
internal review. You can do this by writing to the address below stating your reasons
for your internal review request.
