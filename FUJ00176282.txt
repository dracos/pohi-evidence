Monthly Report — May 2001 Issue: 1.0

1 SUMMARY

The has been no major operational issues with the live service this month. However there has
been a significant drop in the SLA achievement for reference data counter delivery. This is
because the SLA is now being properly measured through use of the acknowledgement agents
and the deployment of M1 has caused issues with non-delivery of reference data by 3am to
migrated outlets. This is under investigation.

$03 has been applied with no issues.

Agreement has been reached with PON on the SLA Day D Rectification Plan. The PSTN laptop
solution will totally replace the Satelan and AP Paper recovery solution . This will be deployed
end 2001.

Work is progressing on the implementation of GGP. Reference data activities on the forms
printing service is going well. The live test system is mostly installed and work is progressing on
the pricing and description Contents Hosting Service . The price to the customer is more than

expected and there will have to be a Programme view on how to proceed before we present this
to the customer.

Work is progressing with TDA to put to bed our final position on SLA’s and service availability.

There are still a number of Quantum issues which are causing concern to POCL. Work is
progressing on the resolution of these issues.

There will be approximately 89 counters being passed across to us from implementation. This is
much higher than expected but it should be able to be handled by CS with some temporary
assistance from Implementation.

ACS OMR will be carried out over the next 2 weeks

2.1.1 Achievement Against SLA

2.1.1.1 Business Incident Management

Achievement for May 2001 is not expected to reach conformance of 100% due to on
going delays in acquiring data for receipts and payment incidents. This is currently the
subject of a review with the SSC re the re-deployment of staff to MSU.

2.1.2 Network

The operational service has run with a good level of stability through the month.

2.1.3 Business Continuity
Business continuity testing has by and large recovered from the delay caused by
our customer's MBCI over OPTIP.

A number of the centrally-held Business Recovery Plans have been extracted
from the database and will be updated in time for the BRAO1 Disaster Recovery

walkthrough planned for

2.1.4 Support

June

The call rate has remained at a lower level during May. The one significant operational
issue related to files being sent to TIP twice. SSC staff were involved in resolving this.

Also a number of Outlets going through M1 migration required technical assistance
from SSC staff.

John Simpkins has been involved in early work on GGP.

Initial work towards identifying non-functional requirements for Network Banking has
been undertaken There is currently a risk that if all Network Banking transactions are
encrypted then SSC will not be able to provide support.

Total calls raised through SSC - 419

Total calls closed through SSC - 438

2.1.5 Reference Data

Day to day service is running well.

The Reference Data for ACP has caused some problems and for the final service is still
to be resolved.

GGP forms printing data is available and it looks as though GGP will be OK. ICON’s for
GGP are now being processed.

The RDMC workstation re-build has been performed on one workstation and is largely
satisfactory. The intention is to move this on to the other workstations and then
implement security. A meeting is to be scheduled by PIT.

Message broadcasts continue to run at an average of 1 per day.

AP Client migration continues — there have been a number of minor issues but largely
the change-over has gone according to plan. The introduction of the new CTO service
is still pending final sign off of the CCN.

Audrey Adams has raised a CP to improve the issues with Cash Account for new year.

RDT have been asked to look at the possibility of providing additional proving for the
Scavenger Agent. A proposal has been put to Gill Jackson and we are awaiting her
comments..

A counter connected to the RDT Rig has been made available to Eposs Development.
This supplies them with up-to-date reference data.

2.1.6 POCL Interfaces

The overall service on APS remains generally good. There are issues over Quantum -
see later section.

There was one significant operational issue where files were sent to TIP twice.

The LFS pilot within PON has continued through the month.

2.1.7 AP Client Migration

DVLNI and a further 23 Girobank clients have been successfully migrated to Horizon on
16" May. A further Girobank migration has been scheduled for 30" May.

The SWALEC DIT is complete and the DIT report has been issued for approval.

The NIE DIT week 1 is complete and one issue has been raised, which is currently with
HAPS for investigation.

RSA have indicated that they are reviewing their relationship with the Postoffice. All
activities are on hold until further notice.

The start of the ACP DIT is delayed due to problems with the reference data.

PON have assured us that the Talexus CCN will be approved without creating a
funding gap for Pathway. Schlumberger has provided Talexus keys for development.

The hardware used for FTMS gateway is not available any more. TDA are looking for
an alternative, which PIT will have to test. Currently with TDA and escalated to Cliff
Wakeman. The new gateway spec is expected by 29th May.

The implementation activities for TVL are behind schedule. The site survey is
complete. Awaiting update on ISDN lines.

The introduction meeting with Consignia Customer Management regarding BBC
Renewals has again highlighted the need to improve our process for client interaction.
This has been refereed to Business Development.

2.2 INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
2.2.1 MSU

2.2.1.1 Service Performance

We are still reviewing the historical System Service remedial payments invoiced to PON
for September 2000 to March 2001. Currently we have only cleared to August 2000 —
this delay is entirely applicable to PON who are slow in providing a response to our
submissions. It is expected that we will have November 2000 completed by the end of
May 2001. MSU are submitting current months to PON in accordance with the time
scale agreed.

The poor coding within the HSH is hampering software call remedial calculations. MSU
are leading a team from both the HSH and MSU to resolve the issue and revisit the call
matrix. The delivery of software calls to PON has been relegated in priority due to their
backlog in dealing with the hardware / network presentations. This will in turn give ICL
Pathway time to ensure that software calls are not classed as remedial in error.

MSU have designed an Access database to calculate the SLA and the remedial
payments due for all hardware, software and network calls. This is currently undergoing

Monthly Report — May 2001 Issue: 1.0

testing and will be used by the HSH via direct access to the MSU V drive. This will
remove the need for separate sets of data, maintain an audit trail of call corrections and
is dynamic in the sense that the SLA calculations will be reviewed each time a call is
amended or re-coded. We will be using this database in the live environment from June
2001.

2.2.1.2 Incident Management

Receipts and Payment misbalances continue to form the bulk of the incidents received.
These are being dealt with as high priority and tracked as cross-domain problems. MSU
are insistent that all fixes are progressed through to the live estate as quickly as
possible to avoid financial integrity issues.

APS reconciliation continues without any real problems other than PON delays in
providing TIP processed values. We have written to PON expressing our concern in
being unable to provide the daily reconciliation in accordance with the joint agreement
when the delay is entirely attributable to their own system issues.

Network banking report specification has been completed and is subject to a review
with the TDA this week. I believe we have been successful in ensuring a reconciliation
system that not only reports by exception but also provides a daily reconciliation at all
points in the process.

2.2.1.3 IT Support

No real issues. We are looking at the processes required to take on the asset
management and IT ordering processes for the entire Large Projects Division. MSU are
currently reviewing the procedures necessary with representatives of all the applicable
divisions and with HR. It is expected that this work will commence in the very near
future.

2.2.1.4 Operational Services

The newly created team within MSU has now settled in within FEL 01 and BRA 01. This
team continues to cover the existing problem management, CP, PCCB processes
within CS but now also has responsibility for the non-polling function. No problems are
currently reported.

2.2.2 Strategic Services Unit

2.2.2.1 Field Service Management
By the end of May a total of 315 Site visits will have been competed by the FSM team.

Frensham Way was successfully re-rolled and migrated on the 2" May, using a
satellite solution. There were a disappointing number of early-life and fail-on-fit
equipment failures, which initially made it difficult to assess the system performance.
Following discussions with PON and the local Federation of Subpostmasters, the office
was placed under the control of a PON HFSO for a fortnight, to assess the situation
impartially. During this period some disruption of the office LAN was observed. This
was traced to working practices in the office, where a lot of business was transacted
within a single customer session, which appeared to overload the LAN’s capability.
Third line has raised this with the TDA and Escher. Overall, the system behaved to
specification, and the HFSO reported that it was fully usable.

Whilst the office has been able to trade normally, there has been some disruption of
the satellite communications. On at least one of these occasions, the cause has been
traced to vandalism damage of the satellite dish. Further incidents are under
investigation. HOT have been asked to submit proposals for a cowling to protect the
dish. The original operational problems at Frensham Way have not recurred since the
transfer to satellite communications. As such, the Divisional Alert will now be closed.

Dave Law and Reg Barton attended two days of the National Federation of
Subpostmasters annual Conference to gauge attitudes to Horizon. Delegates were
mainly concerned at the lack of interest shown by PON in progressing system operating
improvements. Concerns were also voiced over system problems with Quantum cards,
loss of Northern Ireland Electric work, and slow running. A number of service
improvement opportunities were raised, and a full report has been compiled and
circulated.

2.2.2.2 Service Management

2.2.2.2.1 Customer Complaints

The table below shows Customer complaints received between 1* May and 29" May.
Complaints are received from 3 sources: NBSC, PM's directly and referrals from Support
sections. After investigation, the team has identified that approximately 60% of complaints
raised are not justified, all complaints are responded to and investigated.

We have responded to 42 complaints = 19 justified and 23 not justified.

IHSH

Referrals to PON - 5 problem sites and 12 complaint calls.

To date 22 outlets have been referred to PON for retraining, 19 have completed
retraining. 11 have shown a dramatic reduction in calls to the Horizon Helpdesk since
retraining has been completed. 1 1are still on monitor until calls have reduced, or further
action is required by PON.

The complaints from NBSC have remained fairly constant.

The HSH complaints have increased slightly, this is due to the M1 release. Complaints
regarding Agent attitude have dropped again in this period. I am sure this is due to the
measures that have been put in place at HSH to deal with these problems. All issues
have all been addressed individually by the advisor's managers and are alerted to the
Call Centre Manager and the Operations Manager.

Wrong advice complaints remain fairly high; these are still being monitored. HSH are
recommending refresher courses for offending agents.

System issues remain high, these include non- polling problems, Quantum issues, slow
running counters M1 issues and "Blue screen problems. Implementation issues are
starting to increase as the rollout team disappears.

2.2.2.2.2. HSH Call Reduction

The chart below shows the results to date of the impact of an MBS message sent to all
outlets to reduce the number of inappropriate calls being received at the HSH. The
results are disappointingly low at 12%, however May includes the M1 upgrade. June will
be monitored for any further improvement. This still equates to a £497k saving over the

life of the project.

2.2.2.3 Outlet Business Change

Committing time to introducing OCMS into OBC is proving difficult. After months of
delay in getting the application, it has been made available at the time when OBC work
is at a peak — initially the end of year PON ‘clear-out’ and now the Implementation tail.
Where time has been put aside, basic problems have been encountered such has no
terminals built, no secure-ID issued, wrong IP addresses installed. I am committed to
getting this in, but it will be as time and resource allows. In the meantime, the team is
continuing to use the manual processes and their local Access database to meet the
OBC task. Geoff Coxon is available to update the ACDB until the end of June for new
outlets, after which, SSC will need to assist until OCMS is in use.

CS takes on the Implementation Tail as of 4" June. It appears there will be 89 outlets
coming across. The team has been working for some months on procedures and
processes and is ready.

Tivoli product, upon which delivery is dependent, has been prepared and made
available in preparation for PIT/ISD distribution. First distribution of AV contents
have been delivered ready for PIT activities

b. Work continues on a new PID for the introduction of compliance, vulnerability and
intrusion detection toolkits. This will facilitate central monitoring of the live estate in
anticipation of NB requirements. Implementation will need to be progressed via CP.

c. Discussions on security requirements for Network Banking continue at ongoing
workshops. Outputs will be consolidated in revisions to the SRS and SDS. Input is
also being provided to consolidate emerging security requirements for GGP hosting
solution.

d. Work continues in conjunction with Consignia on defining Data Controller
/ Processor responsibilities under the Data Protection Act and agreeing the Subject
Access Request procedure.

e. Four Audit Data Extractions were completed in response to Consignia and internal
requests. Associated witness statements were provided where appropriate on a
“without prejudice" until contractual agreement is reached. Consignia will shortly be
raising an associated Change Request. A meeting has been arranged with
Consignia to clarify their future requirements for audit data to support investigations.

f. An audit of SecurlD users is underway to ensure only legitimate access is
permitted. A revised process for new logons and SecurlD accounts is being
developed to reduce paperwork, enable closer tracking and improve service
response times. The RSA Security "SecurlD Ace Server Maintenance" contract has
been renewed.

g. The Key Manager successfully processed all key requests received this month
including approx. 100 successful rollouts. The KMS Key expiry exercise continues
and 200 outlets have now been sent Memo View prompts. The results are
encouraging; few outlets have contacted HSH and analysis shows that only 6%
have ignored all five prompts. There will need to be a formal follow-up process for
these outlets that do not respond correctly to prompts.

h. An information security control grid is being prepared to facilitate the production of
self-assessment schedules necessary to review levels of compliance across the

organisation as part of the BS7799 Workshop initiative in support of ISO9001
accreditation

Rebuild of RDMC workstations - May - Sheila
One RDMC wis has been rebuilt - Several PinlCls raised but no show-
stoppers. Ref data waiting for network cards from Janet Beard — Once these
have arrived they will arrange for ISD to complete the rebuilds

Remote general purpose gateway installation
Still not working yet. Dave Johns is managing. These were in response to some
CS CPs so I presume someone must want it to work - somewhere in Pauls
area!

S03 - May
Applied with no issues. It needs a TIP file resent and accepted before we can
presume the code is working OK.

S06 - June
Planning is ongoing. This is due to happen at the datacentre from June 18"
until June 30th

S10 - September - 772?
Planning on this will not start until the end of June.

SLA Day D - June & September
Counter-generated message broadcast — this is largely on hold until S06 is
installed but I will review with Paul regarding resource.

Talexus
Appears to be ticking over. I will review plans with Klaus this week if possible

Wing server rebuild — May
Delayed due to a problem with the build supplied by PIT.

UK versus US date issue - Mick
Waiting for info from PIT on the way forward.

2.5 FINANCE

CS Budget for OPEX 2001/02 is £56.7m

Business Model 170301 is £56.5m

Forecast CSApr01 is £55.9m

The major forecast changes from March actuals and forecast, which has been set as
budget, are £600k forecast reduction in HSH costs due to Q1 actuals, and £250k net
forecast increase in OBC revenue.

The Business model was found to have a volume error relating to HSH, and needs
updating with current call data.

The budget needs increasing for 6 security heads.

Next Stephen Muchow review 14" June.

3 ISSUES & RISKS

3.1 OPERATIONS & SUPPORT

The Reference Data SLA is now being monitored more accurately by DWH information
however it is evident that there are still gaps in the information to be strictly accurate
about the SLA as worded in schedule G10. We are looking at ways of making the data
more meaningful but the fact still remains that the SLA as currently set up achieves
little.

There are a number of issues with Quantum which are being managed as problems by
CS, but with considerable activity required of Development staff.

3.2 INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES

3.2.1: MSU

The BIMS SLA has been missed for several quarters due to the ongoing delays in
acquiring data for receipts and payment incidents. This is currently the subject of a
review with the SSC re the re-deployment of staff to MSU.

3.2.2 Business Effectiveness

The expansion of the scope of the BET to include the whole of ICL Pathway will
increase the workload significantly. It is planned to balance this with efficiency savings
of at least 30% to avoid the need to expand the headcount above its current level of
4.5. One of the team’s headcount (0.5 head - part-time) is currently on maternity leave
and the increase in workload will require that an extra 0.5 head is made available until
the permanent employee returns. Achievement of the 30% efficiency saving will
depend on the extended use of “fast-track process definition”, high moral within the
BET and increased output from the team. There is currently a risk that one member of
the team may not be able move along the planned path. It is intended to address this
risk within the next month.

3.2.3 Strategic Services

The lack of time and resource to introduce OCMS into the OBC team as described in
section 2.2.2.3.

Confirmation of ISDN lines being available for next week’s implementation tail and
beyond is still awaited from Energis.

3.3. SECURITY MANAGEMENT

a. A co-incidental DLT failure at both datacentres has resulted in an
incomplete TMS audit trail. This was compounded by a loss in transit of one

tape sent for analysis. The issue has been raised with the Customer and will be
managed under normal problem management procedures. The requirement to
undertake large data extractions continues to have a detrimental effect on the
availability of the audit servers.

b. There is an urgent requirement to introduce the KMS smoothing algorithm to
eliminate the expected key expiry peak and to develop procedures for those
cases where Postmasters fail to respond to associated memo-view prompts.
Ideally this should be informed by management exception reports via Tivoli and
would need a CP to progress.

c. The Key Manager raised five calls including three reported ‘blue screens’ on the
KMA Workstation which is impeding the key generation process.

d. Security input to Network Banking and emerging GGP requirements continues

to place a strain on existing resource, which is fully engaged in supporting the
existing Horizon solution.

3.4. SERVICE INTRODUCTION

GGP implementation has to be seen as very risky. We are bucking a lot of the rules to
get this installed in the time scales and will have to do an amount of back work later to
ensure we have the systems under control.

The amount of time available from TDA to assist with the SO6 and S10 migration could
soon be an issue. I am discussing this with TDA today.
