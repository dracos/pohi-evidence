AH continued the opening hours of the Post Office
are 9 - 5.30 Monday to Friday, 9 - 12.30 on
Saturday. She did not work at a Post office prior

to this.

AH admits that on Wednesday and Fridays when she
is on her own she uses Kim’s passwords to do

parcels and postage. AH admits that both staff
also know her password although they do not use

it.

AH admits they all do end of day reports but she
completes the branch trading statement on her own.
AH said she locks up the branch apart from when
she is on holiday when Kimberley opens up, the
last holiday being in August this year. AH said
she does the cash declarations although the Clerks

know how to do it.

Obviously the reason we’re here is on the 3*4
September there was an audit at your branch that
highlighted a shortage and the shortage being
£14,842.37 ok. I’ll just refer to it as £14,000 I
won't keep saying all that so so long as you’re
aware of the amount. Ok can you tell me why there
was a cash shortage of £14,000 in the account

Well I think it’s all to do with the scratch
cards. I’ve been having problems with them for a
while now and I should have asked for help earlier
on and I didn’t. I can’t see it being anything

else. I know sometimes we get discrepancies for

missing giros and cheques and stuff but I don’t

think it’s going to add up to that amount.

AH said it started at the beginning of the year
and she has been trying to rectify the matter by
telephoning the helpline and lottery line but
things have got on top of her. AH said she
requested an audit after her holiday having spoken
to Glenys at Chesterfield who put her in touch
with another lady. AH said she has nothing to

hide as she would like the matter sorting out.

When did it first come to light when did you know
that you were having problems?

It’s just the figures the money being down every
time I had a transaction correction with the
lottery it always put the figures complete,
obviously when you get your transaction
corrections it changes your figures into your
stock and stuff so every time I actually counted
what I’d remmed in the figures never showed, never
were right and every time I had to put the figures
down to what they said I had on hand that’s when I
was losing all the time and got it all here.

And you say it would affect your cash?

Yes affect my cash because I’1ll give you an
example of one thing.

Yeah I was going to say if you’ve got something.
This was the, just probably a couple of days
before the audit I’m not sure on the dates. I

actually counted my stock what I’d got from what’s

in the dispensers and the stock said that I had 56
of the £5 ones and the system said I had 59. It
said that I’d counted 52 on the £2 ones and the
system said I had 133. On the £1 scratch cards I
counted 387 and the system told me I had 753 so
when I go then to alter the figures of what the
systems saying I had that gives me a £528 loss and
this is what it keeps telling me to do put the
figures right every time you get a transaction
correction so to put these.

12.05 CK Right so how often do you get these then?

AH Well to be honest I seem to be getting them after
every balance, these are the figures what we’ve,
we've gone through every single remming in slip
and activation slip from the 29th May 09 up to 215%
of the 8t> 10 and that’s the.

CK Right that’s fine.

AH Yeah and then this is the, this is every time I’ve
got a transaction correction which is from 5th
June last year, I’ve got 18 transaction
corrections and this is why the figures don’t
tally up because every time I get one of these,
these transaction corrections I’ve got to alter my
stock to what it says.

CK So presumably all of these, the sheet that you’ve
given me just for the benefit of the tape you’ve
give me a sheet that’s showing...

PM Shall we mark it sheet number 1?

13.26 CK ...Well if we call it Alison Hall AHO1 alright

basically it’s an A4 sheet and it’s got various

date periods on and the first one is the 29th of

the 5th '09 to the 234 of the 6t§ '09. It says
‘activated £4,000 paid in £4,330’ so just so that
I can understand this when I get away from this.
Obviously the period I understand what the period
is?.. seen,

AH It’s like a balance period.

13.55 CK When it said activated that’s what
you've?...........

AH wuunel’ ve activated I’ve got every single slip what
I’ve activated on the system and I’ve got every
remming in slip.

CK Right, so and. then the paid in, what does that
mean?

14.08 PM Just show the Officer like you showed me and then
he ‘cos he.

AH This proves that I’ve actually put them back into
the Post Office well these are the, we’ve got
every single day every single day you’ve got to do
this so that shows that I’m putting them back into
the system.

CK Right.

AH That’s a slip to say that I’ve activated all the

ion 8 07/09

scratch cards and that’s the proof that I’m
remming them into the system. Now this, I’ve only
learnt in the last, it was, don’t even know what
date I’m on, after we came back off the holidays I
spoke to somebody called Rebecca I think it’s Post
Office Limited but she works on the lottery side
and I spoke to Rebecca and she said that I’ve been
doing it wrong all this time ‘cos I’ve never had

any proper training on the lottery on the Post

Office side apart from one guy who came when we
started the lottery. Now what I’ve been doing
I’ve been getting 10 packs of the safe and putting
them in my drawer and remming them in into the
system so that means I’ve got so many scratch
cards on so I might have 500 at £1 400 at £2 you
know and that so all them have been remmed in and
then when we need a pack we take it to the shop
side and we activate it which are all these and.
Explain how you activate them.

Yeah well you’ve got to activate a pack and then
that makes sure you can sell the pack then you
know.

That’s activated with the lottery?

That’s activate with the lottery so them’s my
remming in slips which I’ve got for every, every
one, them’s my activation slips to prove that I’ve
activated the pack into the lottery and that’s the
proof that I’ve paid the money back into the Post
Office so I’ve been doing that for I don’t, well
up until this year to August this year when I got
told by Rebecca that I shouldn’t be doing it that
way I should just keep the packs in the drawer not
into the system and when I want to activate one I
take a pack I activate it and then we rem it into

the system so it’s on. So this is what.

AH said the lottery terminal was installed in
August 2007 but she did not have a loss for the

first 2 years.

18.30 AH said she once put £640 of her own money in to

balance the accounts and said she has also been
out before when she has taken money out then put

it back in.

20.46 AH said she could not balance in January but could
not remember how much it was out after which the
figure got higher and higher. She admits she
panicked and should not have let it go on but was
scared to ask for help until she eventually asked

for the audit.

23.34 AH said she has never ever taken a penny out of
the Post Office.

23.43 CK Right that’s fine. The other side of it is
obviously that every month you have to create a
branch trading statement which as you, as it
completes a true record of what transactions
you’ve done and obviously what cash and stock is
on hand. Now you’re saying that in January it
didn’t balance, you falsified the account and then
since January it’s kept going on?

AH It’s just kept going up and up and up and this is
when I’ve just got to the point where right I need
help with this because this is just going.

24.51 CK What sort of concerns me is you’re saying that you
put £640 in of your savings but you can’t remember
when that was?

AH I don’t know I’d have to have a look for my own

bank book.

AH

Again I’1ll be up front with you if I had to put
£640 in somewhere I would certainly.. it would be a
date that stuck in my head?

I just, I’1l have to look at my bank book ‘cos I
took some money out of my savings book and I think
I actually took the rest out of the business if I

can think rightly.

AH said she does not think the money has been
taken out by any of her staff who are aware of the
matter. She has not confronted her staff who are

sometimes on their own.

AH explained at the end of the night or the first
thing in a morning the staff run off the report
for the lottery then she checks the scratch cards
and the money which needs paying to the Post
Office.

The cards that have been remmed in that have not
been activated are they kept secure and things
like that?

They’re usually kept in the post office. I have
got 3 at the moment which is in my cigarette kiosk
which is locked which is in the bottom which
nobody knows are there apart from me and the lady
who’s working today. They’re just ready to
activate onto the because we’re running low on a
few and I didn’t want to come out without you know
‘cos you they don’t like you to have empty

containers sort of thing.

So you’re saying, you’re quite confident ‘cos
obviously we’re looking at potential accountancy
issues in relation to the scratch cards and you’re
quite confident that you’re reconciling them
correctly within the shop, you’re confident that
the.

I am now I wasn’t, I wasn’t to be honest. I’ve
learned quite a few things this last couple of
weeks even like another thing what I didn’t know
last Wednesday when the people who have took over
they was obviously doing the monthly balance and
everything on that Wednesday what’s been done on
the Wednesday obviously I balance at half past 5
on a Wednesday afternoon.

That’s just with the lottery.

But just with the, but obviously the shop’s still
open while half past 9.

Right yeah

So everything what I sell on that Wednesday has
been going through on the Thursday morning but I
have been told this week last week they said last
week that everything what’s done on that Wednesday
must go in on that balance.

On the Wednesday right.

Well they’ve been doing it on the Thursday
morning.

Right I see.

So which I didn’t know so to me that makes it out
like well that’s going to be another, are they
going to say that I’ve got another transaction

correction because I’m not putting it in on the

right day you know and it’s.

31.20 AH was asked if she had started doing things
differently since January but she said not. She
agreed the transaction corrections can be 4 or 5

months old.

35.22 AH said she always counts and checks everything

when she balances.

35.47 CK Right ok so but again what we have said on the
flip side of that that for the last 8, 9 months
that the cash hasn’t been correct has it?

AH No it hasn’t and it’s been my fault but I never,
everything was just getting on top of me and I’ve
tried to, if I’ve looked through these bloody bags
of stuff once I must have looked through them 50
times trying to find the money and it all pins
down to me to be honest to these transaction

corrections what keeps coming through.

36.30 AH said she is not a member of the Federation but

should have asked for help.

38.40 AH agreed the cash was about £13,000 prior to the
audit.
39.00 AH was shown a branch trading statement dated 24th

of 3*4 2010 showing a cash on hand figure of

£26,615.38.

39.19 CK So presumably that figure was not the cash on

hand?
AH No it wasn’t.
CK Right it would be something less than that?
AH Yes.
CK Right I’ve got these up to the 25tt August which

is obviously was just a week before the audit so
it would be fair to say rather than going through
each one of these and showing you them, that each

one of these where it says a cash in hand figure?

AH It wasn’t right no.
CK It wasn’t what was there?
AH No because I just said it was there because I was

struggling with all this what was going on trying
to find it and.

CK But again presumably from what you’ve been saying
we know at the end point it was £14,000.

AH Yeah.

CK At start point it must have been zero so it either
crept up in amounts over the 8, 9months or it
suddenly became £14,000 after the first month?

AH No it wasn’t no.

40.30 AH said although she was concerned she did not
raise the matter with anyone and continued to

falsify the accounts.

41.50 AH agreed that by covering up the matter she has

remained in employment and did it because she was
scared. She continued that she has been trying to
sort the matter and should have done so before the

audit.

42.27 CK Just so I can cover something off as well

obviously prior to coming here I understood there
was problems with the audit. I contacted the chap
in Chesterfield a Neil Thornycroft who looks after
the audit stuff in Chesterfield and what he said
to me I’ve just had a look over, he said in the
last 2 years we’ve issued National Lottery gain
3rd of the 4th 08 to date they’ve issued £1,000 and
£1,052 credit, prize payments 24*® of the 4th 08 to
date £190.20p debit, scratch cards 23, sorry 234
of the 6*§ 08 to date they’ve issued a £2,200
debit that was a stock credit and what he’s saying
is from the 15* of the 18* 08 to date you’ve had
115 stock adjustments at £1,760.00 credit ok. Now
the figures he’s sort of saying there don’t come
anywhere near £14,000.

AH I know.

CK Obviously you’ve brought paperwork which I’m not
in a position to verify or dispute or whatever,
I’m reading that out to what he’s told me so that
I’m being open with you, you know I’ve made some
enquiries, I can go back and say well this is what
Miss Hall has said, does that tie in with
anything.

AH Will they go through these then will they go
through all these figures?

CK I won’t say they’11l go through them but they can
have a look and try and explain what you’re

saying, if you’re saying you’ve adjusted stock

they can have a look and see.

AH I have I’ve adjusted stock on quite a number of
occasions.
CK But what I’m saying is, why have you adjusted it,
is it through your own?
AH No because I’ve got a transaction correction every

time I’ve got a transaction correction I’ve had to

adjust the stock to what they say I should have.
