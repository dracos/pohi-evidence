Subject: Duplicate Records - Witness Statement

Attachments: Duplicate Records Workaround Standard Fujitsu V10 July 10.doc

Gareth

I've had a conversation with Guy this morning concerning the additional statement regarding duplicate
records and he has suggested that I include the following:-

The Audit Mechanism cannot alter the base information and therefore a re-running of the audit process
will always produce the same result.

This I have done, and attach

It was his view that if POL wanted an expert witness statement we should provide - sorry! Initially he
said that a CR would need to be raised by POL but when he realised it would only be for a short while and
that we needed one pretty soon for Kirkoswald he though we could provide this FOC.

If you're happy to do this I will remove the extract from my standard statement.

Give me shout when you have a minute.

Penny
