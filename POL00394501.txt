Peter - As promised attached is a list of those faults raised during $60
Functional Testing which may have a Business impact and which I have either
recommended for deferral or they have been included in the Known Error Log.
Please review and let me know if we have your agreement that these can be
deferred to a Future Release. Obviously, for those raised in your testing
where I have agreed to provide a forecast Release I am pursuing these with
development.

Regards
