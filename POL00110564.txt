Paula, Al

Attached is the current draft of the proposed wording regarding remote access that is to be included in a much longer,
and largely procedural letter to be sent to Freeths later tomorrow. We have a further call with our QC at Spm this
evening to review this wording again with the team and Mark Davies is included on that, For reference the key
statement made in the letter to Freeths in July, was as follows:

“Administrator access to databases. Database and server access and edit permission is provided, within strict controls
(including logging user access), to a small, controlled number of specialist Fujitsu (not Post Office) administrators. As far
as we are currently aware, privileged administrator access has not been used to alter branch transaction data. We are
seeking further assurance from Fujitsu on this point.”

Freeths have picked this up and therefore the new wording is designed to address their challenges.
Please let me have any comments asap

Jane
