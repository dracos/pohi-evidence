MENTION - 1ST FEBRUARY 2010}
Warwick/Jarnail

Ihave this morning received the file that was referred to in Paragraph 5b which I reproduce as follows

5b) — What enquiries were made, bearing in mind the request came from a trainer, as to
the cause of this loss.

Michael's reply - I am sorry I can't remember the training for the office, the
PSA and the learning actions will be on file for the office. I didn’t raise
any issue as to loss of stock or cash during my time at the office.

' have examined the file and the documents contained within it relate to Mrs
Misras application to be subpostmistress, her business plan, the transfer
of the PO, the official secret act, her agreement to repay a £3,400 loss at
the PO in instalments, contract with outgoing subpostmaster e.tc. There
are no further training documents that have not already been served.
The file is too bulky to photocopy.

Please advise if the defence want to see sight of this file.
