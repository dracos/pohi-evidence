Hello Mark,

Please find attached the reviewed outputs from the Deloitte review of the 97 documents.

As previously communicated there is very little of concern - we have highlighted one point on Riposte
around re-use of unique entry numbers, which we believe to be worthy of further investigation (Mark
we discussed this yesterday).

Happy to discuss at your convenience of course.

Many thanks,

Mark
