Subject: FW: Update for Paula

Paula ~ this update is relatively short as we covered much of the ground as part of the Steering Board on Thurs.

Mediation Process Launch
e Appointed CEDR (Centre of Effective Dispute Resolution) as Mediators
Panel of independent advisors nearly finalised.
o Panel will include over approx. 20 professionals made up of Accountants and Legal firms
co Finding law firms who will act is proving problematic although we have 6 lawyers attending the
briefing session, we will have to run another session to ensure geographic coverage.

*® Weare running a briefing/training day for the panel of independent advisors and mediator on 5" Sept in
Birmingham. This will help make sure they are well informed before they are engaged for SPMR cases. I will
chair the day, the JFSA are going to introduce the programme, Andy Parsons will cover the mediation
process, and introduction to the Post Office and the horizon system will be presented by Angela and SS are
preparing a case study.

e Ihave agreed with SS to cap their costs over the coming months. They have also agreed that subject to Angela
and her team being able to provide the right level of investigative support to subpostmasters they will hand
over the work to her, we are aiming to put that process in place by the end of the year.

* We have received 6 registration forms so far for the mediation scheme.

Working Party Terms of Reference
e Working Party TOR — The outstanding issue about whether SS have a vote is still progressing.

Independent Chair

We currently have 5 potential candidates for the independent chair:
Sir Antony Hooper

Sir Alan Ward

Sir Stephen Sedgley

Catherine Bell

Stephen Bligh

I will send the JD and briefing pack separately You now have this.
