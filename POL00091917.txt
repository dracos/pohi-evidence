1.0 Introduction

This document details the initial incident that occurred within the live estate between 09:00
and 10:00 for a four minute period on Monday 9" May 2005 and the activities that were
carried out for the remainder of the business day by the appropriate POA Service
Management and support teams.

The incident that occurred within the live estate was a result of work activity at that time
being carried out by support staff on the Correspondence Servers, which impacted online
services with high transaction Reversals and Time Outs.

Service request E-0505090917 was raised at the time in relation to this incident on the HSH
Powerhelp Helpdesk system.

3.0 Management Summary

The incident within the live estate occurred at the time that support staff were analysing the
Correspondence Server volume capacity using the Riposte Volume Command.

At this present moment the root cause of the incident isn’t known, as further investigations
continue by the support teams.

The purpose of this activity on the Correspondence Servers was to ensure that there available
spare disk capacity across the Correspondence Server disk volumes for the Riposte message
stores.

The work activity was carried out as a precautionary measure as a result of an archiving job
not completing following an event storm that occurred the previous week.

The Riposte Volume command has been used on numerous occasions before with no impact
to service, as it simply displays the details of Riposte Volumes.

Running this command stops Riposte services running for a micro-second, and then starts
(unlocks) the services again after the volume in taken. It is believed that in this instance, due
to a bug in Riposte, the services did not start again. A peak (PC0120645) has been raised with
Escher development.

This caused the first degradation to service for 4 minutes between 9 and 10am. An event
storm with messages from the Correspondence Servers stated that services were locked. As
timeouts reduced to normal levels, the support teams diagnosed that the event storms and
locks had cleared.

At 1030am SSC started to be aware through events being generated that two of the clusters
weren’t harvesting messages from the counters.

Following further subsequent analysis by SSC support staff, in order to was made to restart
the Riposte services on the impacted servers within clusters 1 & 2 respective following
discussions between POL and POA senior management.

This decision was justified by a high number of calls being received into the service desk and
by the increase in the abandoned rate (section 5 Table B) at the desk between 12:00 — 13:00.

The Riposte services were restarted at 13:05 on those servers in clusters 1& 2

As SSC continued to monitor the live estate it was clear that as the correspondence servers
were in the process of synchronising the Riposte message stores within the clusters that this
was having a performance impact on the live estate and timeouts were continuing to occur at
the counters.

SSC formulated a maintenance plan to resolve the impacts on the live estate which was
agreed to be implemented that evening from 18:45.

The work activity with regard to the maintenance plan concluded at 21:45 this involved
restarting Riposte services on each of the clusters in order to ensure that the Correspondence
servers were returned to normal operational status.

4.0 Description of the fault and service failure

The incident that occurred presently hasn’t a determined root cause and occurred within the
live estate whilst the SSC were analysing the Correspondence Server volume capacity using
the RiposteVolume Command. The purpose of this activity was to ensure that there available
spare disk capacity across the Correspondence Server disk volumes.

The work activity was carried out as a precautionary measure as a result of an archiving job
not completing following an event storm that occurred the previous week.

The RiposteVolume command has been used on numerous occasions before with no impact
to service, as it simply displays the details of Riposte Volumes.

Running this command stops Riposte services running for a micro-second, and then starts
(unlocks) the services again after the volume in taken. It is believed that in this instance, due
to a bug in Riposte, the services did not start again. A peak (PC0120645) has been raised with
Escher development.

This caused the first degradation to service for 4 minutes between 9 and 10am. An event
storm with messages from the Correspondence Servers stated that services were locked. As
timeouts reduced to normal levels, the support teams diagnosed that the event storms and
locks had cleared.

At 10:30am, the SSC balance monitor alerted that C12 responses for Clusters 1 and 2 were
not being harvested. There were no other indications of service issues at this stage.
Investigations isolated the fault to one server on each cluster which was processing 1% of

their normal transaction rate. NB if the servers had failed completely, then the counters would
have automatically balanced across the remaining 3 servers. As the server was still running,
this degraded the service to the counters connected.

From a customer perspective, the customers would have noticed timeouts but a subsequent
transaction retry attempt would have been successful (section 5 table A2).

This Riposte fault has been seen on counters before but never at the data centre (PC0101472
tefers - fix at S90).

As the calls into the Helpdesk rose through the morning, the number of calls waiting reached
~40 at 12:30, it was clear that the affected Correspondence Servers required reloading in
order to restore these servers to normal operating speeds. Ie. the Riposte services were still
locked.

A decision was made by Senior POL and POA Management following advice from the
support teams to stop and restart the Riposte services on a server within cluster], based on the
number of transaction timeouts/events occurring via system management toolsets and the
number of calls being received into the HSD.

At 13:05 one of the Bootle Correspondence servers had the Riposte services stopped and then
restarted. Whilst this activity was taking place the numbers of calls waiting reduced to 0 at
the HSD service desk. During that activity, the percentage of transaction timeouts was less
than 2%

SSC staff continued throughout the remainder of the day to evaluate and monitor the live
estate and to formulate an appropriate maintenance plan.

The maintenance plan was derived to perform the remedial activity to the Correspondence
servers that required the Riposte services to be stopped and restarted outside of Core hours on
specific servers within clusters 1, 2 & 3 respectively.

The activity plan and communication plan surrounding this activity was agreed by Service
Management and support staff and approved through the OCP process (OCP11050).

This maintenance activity was required to return the Correspondence servers to normal
operational mode and ensure that the overnight harvesting activity could take place.

As part of the OCP a decision was made to suspend harvesting until the remedial activity had
taken place.

E Top Up Transaction failures displayed in the table above occurred due to the interface
between Fujitsu and EPAY. When authorised transactions timeout at the counter a reversal is
automatically generated by the counter. Transactions were timing out due to the
Correspondence server problems on this day. EPAY's systems have to match the reversal to
the original authorisation request. The reversal has to get to EPAY within a time limit of 10
minutes.

E-pay advise that there is a high probability of a Reversal being successful if it arrives within
10 minutes of the original Sale Request. E-pay will attempt to reverse Transactions up to an
hour after the original Sale Request, but advise that this is not likely to be successful. E-pay
will not action a Reversal that arrives more than an hour after the original Sale Request.

Because of the problems with Correspondence server replication on this day a number of
these reversals did not get through within the time limits.

Under normal circumstances, even if there has been a problem with a Correspondence server,
the remaining correspondence servers in that cluster will ensure that the reversal is processed
and handed off to the agents (of which there are also multiple instances) to pass to Epay.

In the case of the issues on 9" May there were multiple correspondence servers running
slowly without failing and the reversals did not get to Epay within the time limits. (ie if the
Correspondence server had failed in totality, the others in the cluster would have run
normally and the timing issue would not have occurred). This is the first recorded instance
of this sort of Riposte problem on multiple correspondence servers on the project.

The instance of this sort of issue is therefore very rare. In mitigation of the original issue SSC
staff will no longer use the Riposte Volume Command during core hours until Escher have
resolved the underlying bug.

One possible solution is to mitigate the financial exposure that Epay change their processing -
however this would be difficult as a customer could be using the credit on the phone
immediately upon leaving a Post Office branch.

For banking and debit/credit card transactions the process is that a counter requests a
transaction, the financial institution accepts the transaction and the counter then confirms the
transaction, which does not actually take place until the confirmation is received and can
usually then be reversed up to 48 hours later. For an E-Topup transaction, Epay acts
immediately on receipt of the request, issues an accept, and relies on the counter to reverse
within 10 minutes.

Although it would be better for clients to operate the full financial transaction
request/accept/confirm (RAC) model, and it may be possible to persuade Epay to change
their process, in practice this may be very difficult.

Another option would be for Fujitsu, on early detection of a Correspondence server incident
which could affect Epay transactions, to switch off the links to Epay to stop all transactions
going through, however, this clearly would cause customer dissatisfaction and damage.
