To: Alice Perkins!
Subject: Re: Briefing Alasdair

Yes a beautiful morning!
Thanks Alice. It will be a surprise and I need to make sure we have enough time to talk it through.

My approach needs to remind Alasdair where we left off, then paint the story to arrive at the conclusion carefully. Esp as
the last time we spoke, I had been in the place of trying to help Susan repair the damage. So that will be a change.

I think he will understand. Alasdair had raised a couple of questions re Susan's judgement, but less than others.

Re speaking to Susan, I had a tip-off from Alwen that Susan may raise it with me on Monday herself. They spoke mid-
week: Susan said it was making her ill, and, she didn't see how she could continue having lost the confidence of the
Board.

Exactly the same conclusions.

Although that makes it slightly easier if she does raise it, people can change their minds (not tidy!). So I shall wait and
see what happens. Either way, assuming Susan is in 148, we will have the conversation on Monday.

I am speaking to Fay this weekend as we will need to be thinking about which lawyers we use, interim cover and about
business messages. And indeed when Susan goes. It sounds as though she wants that to be straightaway. Much will
depend on Susan's state of mind. I have been in situations like this where people have been helpful and suggested the
best outcomes themselves. Susan is capable of doing that but I'm not holding my breath.

I hope this sounds calm - I am - on the outside... on the inside, it was never going to be easy. (But it's nothing to what
Susan is going through, irrespective of what caused it.)

Thank you for your support - and helpful questions are always welcome.
Enjoy the weekend.

I would of course, be happy to talk to him whenever he likes.

place with Richard; none of us could have foreseen the reaction. (I wasn't making work btw, it was Martin's suggestion as
Richard had asked some good and challenging questions of us. I will simply play by ear with Richard. Not a big deal
either way; and I certainly don't want him thinking I'm trying to soften the blow.)

yesterday. As well as the formal goodwill exchanges, key business points were made, which should play into our
negotiations over the IPR. I shall make sure Chris follows up. He was only over for two days - we are clearly important
(as they are to us). Lesley did a great job in the briefing, planning and her contribution to the meeting.

happened is embarassing but your willingness to a) be straightforward with him, and b) compensate him properly will
mean that he will feel properly treated. And who knows, we may have something genuine for him to do in future. When
this is out of the way, and he's back from his autumn trip, I'll take him out to lunch.

>> Hi Alice, I'm sorry if there's a misunderstanding. That was what I tried to explain when I called you: if Susan and
Simon Baker had left the business, then we couldn't effectively do Richard's review. I heard you say that you had the
same thought. I felt we should stand him down, as the context is now different. (That was why I called you - no other
reason. Just to make sure we were on the same page.)

>> I still feel very strongly that we should do the LL review. As I'm sure you do too. And as the individuals who would
have had the sensitivities will have moved on, then I would like the business to do it - we all of us know what needs to be
said. We did a good review in the case of Rainbow. We can for this.

I'll get Theresa to check diaries. Martin will try to get the revised TOR/brief to us by mid-morning.

arrange a half-day session with him to do that, before we prepare a final report for the ARC/Board. We will always benefit
from an external and independent perspective. I will ask Martin to add this in.

>>> Hi,

>>> When we spoke on Wed, we hadn't concluded what we should do re the lessons learned review, other than asking
Martin E to rewrite much narrower TOR. The options we discussed were to discuss revised TOR with the lawyers and

then either proceed now or wait till SS were off the scene.

>>> You also (on the phone later, I think) commented that it would be v difficult to do the review given changes in
personnel.

>>> The decision to stand RH down completely was a surprise - I hadn't got to that conclusion. (I'm not saying it isn't right -
just want to understand.)

>>> Could you please share your reasoning on that with me?

Still open, with the possibility of not giving him the job! (I have had a good recommendation from someone who knows
and has worked with Hooper, so certainly worth seeing him.)
