Subject: Re: Horizon Investigation: next week off site meeting & quick update

Alwen are you going to be with her all morning, Simon and I need some time with you to work out the strategy
for taking this forward, and your input was key as we need to decide how we deal with the aftermath of the JA

meeting and how to take this forward.

Susan, Alwen

Next Wednesday morning (9-11.30) I have scheduled an offsite meeting with the three of
us to get some thinking time to cover the following points:

e® Scenario mapping — pre-think most likely outcomes and stakeholder reactions if
we continue on our current trajectory

e How we manage James

¢ How we deal with MPs cases

e Budget and timescales

¢ POLs investigative process

lan is holding the date in his diary. Ron can’t make it in person, put could join us on the
phone. My proposal is that we just have lan join us from 10-11, that gives us some time
before and afterward to agree a way forward with lan adding his input.

A quick update on Spot reviews: We have now received 4 spot reviews from Second sight.
Post Office (working with Fujitsu) has prepared a response to these. We have asked Bond
Pearce to review/rewrite our responses to ensure we get our points across. We should
have the Bond Pearce responses back early next week.
