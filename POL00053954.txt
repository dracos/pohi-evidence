Dear Sir

REGINA v SEEMA MISRA
GUILDFORD CROWN COURT
TRIAL - 15™ MARCH 2010

Jarnail Singh has referred paragraph 23 of your advice in this case to me.

I am a little concerned at Counsel's suggestion that Royal Mail disclose Hosi's
Expert Report and more particularly the prosecution papers. Counsel may not
realise that Hosi’s report is preliminary as the Defence have certainly not
completed their enquiries. I do not understand the thinking behind disclosure of
prosecution papers in respect of a case that has not been brought to trial. Is
Counsel saying that the report though incomplete undermines the prosecution
case?

Further could Counsel advise how it assists the Defence to know that the
prosecution has another undecided case where the reliability of Horizon in issue.
I am raising this as at the moment a number of Defendants are taking this line
simply because they have seen the article in the computer press rather than
because Horizon has thrown up a problem.

Could Counsel advise.

Yours faithfully

JA McFarlane
Principal Lawyer
