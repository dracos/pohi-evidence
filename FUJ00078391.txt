1. SYSTEM TESTING

Overall summary

Migration: Main Pass Cycle 2 started on schedule on 9/11/98. A rehearsal of
the live Oracle database was successfully performed. It will be
essential to rehearse a full data centre migration, including
correspondence servers, using copies of live data to ensure
adequate filestore and tablespace for migration to be completed in
the live environment.

BIT: A regression cycle started on 10/11/98. Acceptance Pass will
commence on 25/11, but the following issues need to be resolved:
Delivery of Acceptance PinlCls, Delivery, Stability and Necessity of

Audit, RDMC/RDDS and Reference Data stabilisation and availability

of specialist resources.

Y2K: External Interface Testing is progressing and No PinlCLs were raised

in the past week. Input from CAPS is still poor. End date still
(currently) achievable, but we are dependent on CAPS to improve
data, processing time and sequences, etc.

System Test:

¢ BPS Final Pass is on schedule with 64% complete and a 53% success rate.
BPR testing has been removed from this test stream. Complete testing of
Reconciliation and Recovery is dependent on the resolution of several
outstanding PinICLs.

e¢ RODB Main Pass 4 is 82% complete with a 77% success rate. Issues include
PinICLs raised in Final Pass will be fixed and delivered in live patches and an

early cut of FTMS was tested in DIT2 but RODB has not been tested at the latest

release.

* Training Pass has executed 59% of the scripts with a 50% success rate, 41% are

deferred. Build problems have suspended this cycle. Critical problems include

delivery and success of WP_1995, the uncertainty of testing training mode under

POLO and outstanding PinICL on Build.

« EPOSS Regression is awaiting RDMC code to rebuild system test reference
data. Experienced resources are needed back in the team for final pass.

e¢ RDMC Cycle 2 is on schedule with an 85% success rate and is planned to
complete on 18/11. The new versions of RDDS and Workstation software are

now available. Issues include availability of resources and script revisions for the

details required for Acceptance.

¢ TPS Final Pass started on 9/11/98 with pre-thread activity on 8/11/98.

¢ MiECCO Cycle 1 is 42% complete with a 97% success rate. It should complete
on 13/11/98.

« MiMan Cycle 3 is 50% complete with a 99% success rate. It should also
complete on 13/11/98.

« MIS - Data Warehouse Final Pass started on 6/11/98. The planned end date will

slip 10 days, with the inclusion of CP1524. The MIS Standing Data is notin a
state that will support the product. It impacts the ability to produce certain
Business Object reports, calculate performance achievement figures for certain

SLAs and consequently the ability to create Liquidated Damages for Remedial
SLAs.

¢ MIS - Clients Final Pass started on 11/11/98 with confidence testing of the build.
The planned end date will slip 10 days, with the inclusion of CP1524.

E2E is on schedule with on-line day 24 in progress. It is planned to complete on
20/11.

MO is now managed by Customer Services.

EPOSS MOT Regression
¢ None. Awaiting RDMC code to rebuild system test reference data.

Progress Against Plan: (version 6)
¢ On schedule.

Critical Problems:
e Need to get Les & Eric back for Final Pass.

BPS ST Final Pass

¢ Excluding BPR testing the remainder of BPS System test final pass execution is
on schedule.

e The BPR testing has been moved out of the core BPS child benefit testing
stream in order to facilitate fully the testing of Reconciliation and Recovery of
incomplete transactions with PinICL fixes at a later baseline. It is expected that
BPR will not be testable until 21 outstanding issues identified in PinICLs
PC17841, 17891, 18275, 18150, 18074 & 18068 have been resolved.

¢ BPR testing has moved onto the PinICL clearance rig ST04 in order that it can be
tested at increment 7.

e Weare having problems with the CP script CPS0101 and anticipate a high
failure rate attributed to script errors.

e Due to the delays caused by BPR not being ready for final pass Multi-benefit test
execution must be brought forward in order to hold our end dates. This is
dependent on BIT01 being rebuilt in order to start.

Progress Against Plan (version 6)
¢ On Schedule

Critical Problems
¢ BITO1 must be rebuilt to increment 7 to hold our end dates.

TPS — PinICL Clearance

¢ Final Pass commenced on 9/11/98, having run pre-thread on 8/11. Discovered
on 10/11 thatone TPS module missing from inc 7. This has been applied. All data
to be reharvested so that all Final Pass will have been run through new version.

Progress Against Plan: (version 6)

e On schedule even though effectively started 2 days late due to blitz testing of
build not on plan.

RDMC ST Cycle 2

e Slow progress. The new versions of RDDS & Workstation software are available.
Will attempt to complete cycle 2 prior to restarting with new versions as have
never run the last 3 days of the script before. Resources supporting reference
data in other test streams.

Progress Against Plan (Version 6)
¢ RDMC is on schedule.

Critical Problems

* No resource available to update/write BT & HLTP for new memo view LLTS.
Assistance required from analysis team.

¢ Current plans do not include the running of the new memo view scripts.

¢ Analysis team have provided us with a set of specifications/CPs which we should
be working to. Several days scripting required to ensure up to date once
document versions established.

¢ Scripts do not provide detail required for acceptance. Work needs to be done
whilst updates above being addressed.

Issues

« We have a new trainee to bring up to speed on RDMC System testing. While
this new resource is essential, there will be a little lost time in the next week or
so while he’s coming up to speed.

e Slow progress. Awaiting delivery of new version of RDDS & Workstation
software.

e Resources fully utilised supporting reference data in other test streams.

Both test rigs have now been built for Final Pass.

¢ The MISO101 script has completed execution of the 2nd (of 19) Processing
Days in its Final Pass cycle.

¢ The MISO102, MISO103 and FCM0101 scripts testing the Client applications
have not yet started execution.

MIS ST

MIS0101 - Data Warehouse (DWH) Final Pass:
¢ This is being run on the MISO2/SEQ7 test rig which currently has the following
build configuration: System Baseline 9F
DWHSE_2_0_B014
DWHSE_2_0_B014_I1
SLAMCACHEDB_2_0_B011

PWY_WP_2167
PWY_WP_2178
PWY_WP_2192

¢ The rebuild of the rig commenced on the 3rd November 1998. Various build
problems, mainly revolving around Security, prevented the confidence/blitz test to
be completed until the 6th November 1998.

e Final Pass proper commenced on the 6th November 1998 with Processing Days
28th December 1998 and 2nd January 1999 having completed execution. Test
execution is currently paused to enable test results to be checked.

Actual Progress Against Plan (Version 6)

e The Final Pass actually started ahead of schedule but due to the fact that
CP1524 has been approved, and must be included in the Pass, the planned end
date will slip to the 11th December 1998.

Critical Problems

¢ The MIS Standing Data is still not in a state that will support the product. It
impacts on our ability to produce certain Business Object reports, our ability to
calculate performance achievement figures for certain SLAs and consequently
our ability to create Liquidated Damages for Remedial SLAs which then impinges
upon the Remedy Credits that are included in the Invoices.

e We have executed two Processing Days in this Final Pass and already we are
having to change test data (that is correct) to allow for erroneous (or missing)
Standing Data. In addition we have encountered test conditions that have not
proven successful in this Pass due to Standing Data changes since Main Pass.

¢ The Standing Data is reliant upon the reference document DW/DOC/012
‘Common Charging Standing Data’ which has yet to be finalised.

¢ Until such time as this issue is resolved the areas affected must be considered to
be at a very high risk.

¢ Itis already too late to include any re-delivery of the Standing Data in question
into this Final Pass as that would inevitably involve a rebuild that could not be
accommodated mid Pass.

Issues:

e PinICL PC0012773 and related CP 1542 has yet to be resolved. A copy of the
proposed HLD and SRS had been received from CFM, but the CP was rejected
as the user (and ourselves) had issues with the CP. Our understanding is that
the user considers a solution essential for NR2 and as such we expect the
proposal to be resurrected in some form. This would mean inclusion in Final
Pass with the functionality being tested for the first time.

¢ CP1524, now approved, will be incorporated into Final Pass causing the planned
end date to slip to the 11th December 1998. As the functionality will be being
tested for the first time it must be considered to be at risk.

¢ New Versions of the Data Warehouse FRM Report Requirements (namely docs
DW/REQ/020 and DW/REQ/027) have been received. These have been
compared against the requirements that we have been working from and have
been found to be considerably different. The source of the documents has
confirmed that they are not being introduced via a CP as the earlier versions
‘were never signed off’. As things currently stand our test conditions, test data,
expected results etc. will not satisfy the requirement as defined in these new
documents but we will be attempting to cover any new functionality within Final
Pass. As this functionality will be being tested for the first time it must be
considered to be at risk.

e We have now received some, but not all, files from Sorbus in the NR2 format for
DIT testing. We are currently desk checking the files with a view to attempting to
run them through the Data Warehouse. Early indications are that it was a good

job we've now had a view of the files rather than leave it closer to Live! The

remaining files are being chased with Horizon, but as of yet we have no e.t.a. for
their arrival.

The first Processing Day of the Data Warehouse cycle (28th December 1998) is
currently being run as a confidence test of the build and to make available
various Views that are required for the Client application testing.

Actual Progress Against Plan (version 6)
e Final Pass has not yet reached its scheduled start date for this script of the 30th
November 1998.

Issues

¢ There is still no Increment 1 of the MISCLIENTPC baseline yet available. It may
be that the Increment will be taken when it is ready to make as many PinlCL fixes
as possible available to this Pass.

Actual Progress Against Plan (version 6)

Final Pass has not yet reached its scheduled start date for this script of the 12th
November 1998.

Training ST Final Pass

Out of 401 test 200 passed (50%), 37 Failed (9%) and 41% deferred. 59% of

the script has been attempted.

Due to a problem with the Build on ST04, testing has for this cycle has been

suspended. (PinICLs 18062 and 18070)

The Script is biased towards EPOSS and does not cover in any detail BES, APS

or OBCS testing. Only 12 out of 401 tests steps cover non EPOSS functionality.

Typical script lines are:

e At PO3 in TM, clerk logged in as TM clerk attempts to perform all TM BES
scenarios. - Swipe each of the BES training cards through the counter
reader.

e “At PO3 in LM manager attempts to use TM pre-defined OBCS training
props. Scan each of the Training Temporary Token and Training OBCS
barcodes with the Infra-red reader.”

The “Training props” (OBCS bar codes, APS bar codes, BES PUNs, BES

Temporary Tokens) mentioned above are unsupported documents created by

the developer. The scripts should use the formal “props” developed by Peritas.

(See PinICLs 18055, 12559)

Critical Problems

Build on ST04 is now out of date. (It has 9F Inc 6.1 + Fast Tracks to bring it up
to similar build as STO2). Outstanding PinICL on Build: 180070 - Unable to
produce balance snapshot - This prevents stock unit rollover and cash
accounting testing to be perform (Approx 35% of the script). This did work on a
similar build (STO2).

No BES Functionality is Available at Gateway or Slave Counter. New version of
TMSPOREDIRECTOR required (CP1517 — WP1995, Requested 05/11/98 from
PIT)

Training mode must be tested under POLO, Last time this was tested (by the
EPOSS team) Training mode would not initialise.

No more benefit can be gained from testing on the current baseline and we
need to more forward to increment 7 before resumption of testing is worthwhile.

Issues

Test Rig currently has one outlet with training installed but requires 2 outlets to

fully exercise the script.

e The script contains errors, which require modification before next Phase.

e Training requires the riposte user must be a member of the ADMIN group, for
initialise training/re-initialise to work, which will not be allowed in live (for security
reasons?)

e Gareth has a fix WP_1995 to enable BES to work we believe this has made
increment 7

e The second part of this is an Escher component (which we have already
received) to enable foreign encashments to work

¢ Dave Roberts (Training developer) expects a problem with reentry into training
and resuming a previous session on a given day causing a problem such that
BES transaction can not be continued. This may take a service down which can
not be restarted until the next day.

RODB System Test Main Pass 3

e¢ RODB migrated and went live 09/11/98 with inc.18.

¢ T&l are no longer responsible for supporting version 2.5 of the RODB and the
resources are committed to other testing streams.

SYSTEM TESTING:

e System test began 01/11/98 with inc. 17.

¢ The rig was updated to inc. 18 on 06/11/98.

¢ Slippage to expected daily totals has occurred due to PinICL testing and
incremental builds being installed.

e Final pass system test is approx. 60% complete with 96% pass rate.

¢ The final pass is expected to be completed by Wednesday 11/11/98.

MIGRATION:

e Migration has encountered many build problems due to mismatch of build
migration scripts delivered against those base-lined in PCMS.

« The migration scripts were still in the process of being delivered week
commencing 02/11/98.

¢ The migration rig script was finally built and run by end of day 05/11/98 and
migration data checks began 06/11/98.

¢ The migration script was 20% complete by Monday 09/11/98 but many difficulties
were encountered running the script against the live data largely due to the
outstanding B Pinicls remaining on RODB 4th stack.

¢ Due to lack of disk space on the migration test rig regular backups could not be
taken and when the original backup was restored (Monday 09/11/98) sql server
was corrupted requiring a full rebuild of SQL server and possibly NT.

¢ For the reasons stated above, and the fact that the functionality in the rest of the
migration test script has been tested in system testing, the required rebuild of the
migration rig and the completion of the test rig is to be abandoned.

¢ The migration testing produced 3 B pinicls which Technical Direct are aware of
and live fixes for these errors have either already been applied to the live system
or will be released in later live incremental fixes.

PINICLs:
e There are no pinicls on T&l stack at the moment
e¢ RODB 4th, the Technical Direct stack has 31 PinICLs outstanding.

e Of these 3 are B and all relate to live data issues, 14 C and 14 D PinlCLs.

Progress Against Plan (version 6)
e Will complete final regression this week — 1 week late

Critical Problems

¢ Customer Services must now accept responsibility for Live Support and test all
outstanding PinICLs delivered post live build.

¢ An early cut of FTMS was tested in DIT2 but RODB has not been tested at the
latest release because an environment was not provided in time by PIT/SPTS

Issues

e The migration rig corrupted irretrievably 09/11/98 and completing the migration
script was abandoned.

¢ Migration testing did not complete due to the fact that many of the fixes required
for successful migration are delivered in live patches inc. 18 & 19 and migration
started using inc. 17.

¢ PinlCLs raised in system test final pass will be fixed and delivered in live patches.

2. TECHNICAL & SECURITY TESTING

Overall Summary

e Build 9F increment 7 arrived on 05/11, and rebuilding of all platforms has
started. Audit Workstation, ECCO Migration Agent Server and Laptop still
missing with delivery expected 11/11/98.

¢ Business Support Client PC and FRM NT Client PC builds reported as defective
causing a halt to security testing of these platforms.

¢ The cause of write failures to the EMC unit has been identified and escalated

2.1. Performance

e The scope of the Tranche 2 Tests have been discussed and a draft plan issued
for comments. A provisional list of tests for Tranche 3 has also been produced.

e Reviews of tests 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 (SE70 and NUMA-Q host testing at
Weybridge) have been carried out.

e« Ameeting was held with ITSA to discuss and agree the scope of the CAPS
Interface test (Test 6.1).

« The OBCS Administration and Encashment Bulk Harvester (Test 4.4) Test
Completion Report is nearing completion. Support is being provided to Agents
Development team to resolve the inconsistencies between messages scanned
and harvested.

¢ The APS Bulk Harvester (Test 4.7) test is scheduled to commence this week.

¢ The ‘write failures to EMC unit' issue has been further investigated. These
failures are caused by the JayCor driver not being able to operate with non-
buffered disc I/Os as required by Riposte. This critical issue has been escalated
with EMC/JayCor who are identifying a solution.

¢ The interface tests between the host and the TIP Local PC (Test 6.3); and
between the TIP Local PC and the TIP Remote PC (Test 6.2) have completed
except the test associated with checking latency effects. It has been found out
that it is too difficult to simulate the latency within the 2Mbps relay link at
Bracknell. Therefore the ‘real’ link between Feltham and Huthwaite is being
investigated as an alternative platform for this part of the test. Additional tests
on an NFS patch provided by Humming Bird have been carried out. This NFS
patch appears to resolve the long standing NFS/FTMS problem.

Issues

e Write failures to EMC unit (PinICL PC0017598). The early resolution of this is
critical.

« Performance Test Requirements (incl. Tests 3.7, 3.5/4.5, 4.6, 4.9, 4.10 and
8.2/8.3) need to be defined. This is now being resolved as a high priority task.

e Feltham/Huthwaite link availability for latency test (Test 6.3)

2.2. Systems Management & Counter Testing

¢ Progress during the last week has been limited because of the late delivery of SB
9f7. The week was spent retesting PINICLs where possible, rebuilding systems
in preparation for INC 7, documentation updating and progressing other test
areas not dependent on INC 7.

« No change in test statistics

¢ LLTSs being updated

¢ Patrol / Tivoli integration success with Tivoli picking up events from Patrol.

Issues
¢ Slow response to the outstanding PINICLs with Tivoli-Dev

2.3. Technical Integrity & Networking

¢ Testing is now progressing well - total of 204 tests of 320 have been run, 154
have passed.

e Archive Server is being built with 9F inc 7. Inc 7 will not be taken for other areas

until after 20/11.
e Test team and CFM working together on new Correspondence Server
configuration
e £1 link in in place and working, tests have commenced.
« HLTP 3.0 has now been signed off, work in progress in producing v4.

Issues

¢ New Correspondence Servers need rebuilding due to SCSI vs Fibre connection;
this is delaying testing

« Test team helping with Tivoli/Maestro design evaluation work has impacted the
number of tests run

¢ 11 outlet tests awaiting CPs and PINICLs

2.4. Security

¢ 9FI7 eventually arrived on 5/11/98 in drips and drabs. Audit Workstation, ECCO
Migration Agent Server and Laptop are still missing from that promised with
delivery expected 11/11/98.

e Business Support Client PC (PinICL 18269) and FRM NT Client PC builds
reported as defective causing a halt to security testing of these platforms until a
further build is available.

Firewall test rig is now built to Dave Tanners design requirements. The firewall
rules to handle De La Rue, Tivoli, Time server & NT domain traffic have been
implemented by the Security team, remaining rules being investigated with
KIDO1.

e Firewall testing has started and a program of test by the three test groups will be
carried out over the next 2 weeks.

¢ Three Oracle Access Control Matrices are awaited urgently. These were all due
last week. Without them we cannot test access to these databases in Rel2.

TPS: TI/POL/001
RDDS: PA/TEM/0001
RDMC: PA/TEM/0001

e We urgently require action on Pin14284 to ensure the MIS client will be useable

Issues

« The core NT platforms have been built, but a number of platforms are still
missing along with the NT Workstations.

e Three Oracle Access Control Matrices are awaited urgently. These were all due
last week. Without them, access to these databases cannot be tested in Rel2.

2.5. Network & Test Support

¢ SB9Finc7 delivered 5/11/98 from PIT. Generation of counter reference data via
the new RDMC/RDDS route is proving to be a slow process with SPTS providing
assistance. Guidance in the handover documents from PIT is either not available
or misleading but SPTS are working hard to fill the gaps.

e Network: minor enhancements completed to attach Washington link.

¢ Strataview Plus for IGX delivered 9/11/98.

¢ SE30 returned to FELO1. NUMA-Q ready for removal.

3. BUSINESS INTEGRATION TESTING

Overall Summary

¢ BITO3 - First Pass & Main Pass Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 completed. Rig upgraded to
Of Inc 7 on 6/11/98. Blitzing/Regression testing in progress.

¢ Y2K (BIT04) - First Pass & Second Pass complete. External Interface Testing
started 19/10/98, initial test phase with ESNS completed on 26/10/98. CAPS
Interface testing started on 26/10/98 and ongoing, but progress has been limited
due to CAPS System Test team problems in producing interface files.

3.1. BIT

BIT03 Regression/Blitzing/Proving

¢ The last week has been spent trying to get 9F Increment 7 and 7.1 into a fit state
to start a blitz activity. This has been long and drawn out. RDMC/RDDS and
Reference Data has again been the biggest headache, and wasted most of our
time. We still do not have suitable Reference Data, and are having to work
around it to perform other blitz testing.

e We are now on Day? of a blitz activity, which is hoped to encompass the majority
of the key acceptance testing.

¢ Audit remedial activity is still not progressing well. The Audit Archive Sever has
not been included in increment 7 or 7.1 yet. File content checkers have not been
made available as expected.

¢ Tivoli is on the rig, and is being monitored.

¢ It will have to be discussed whether we risk putting the untested Audit into the
Acceptance Pass.

¢ The expansion of the BITO3 LLTS for Audit is still approx. 90% complete. Will be
completed when we get our hands on a Audit Server.

Actual Progress Against Plan (version 6)

« Progressing within Regression Activity as per plan.

¢ Suitability to start Acceptance Pass on 25/11 will be dependant on whether
enough deliveries are made for outstanding Acceptance PinICLs.

¢ Whether Audit is in a fit state & whether or not it is mandatory RDMC/RDDS and
Reference Data being stable.

Critical Problems

e The approx. 10 outstanding PinlCLs required for Acceptance Criteria

« RDMC/RDDS and Reference Data not working adequately at increment 7 or 7.1

¢ Audit/Archive Server & software still not handed over from PIT.

e Awaiting Audit Files Content Analyst Resources. 1 message store & 1 CMS/PAS
Oracle specialist expected, but have not been made available.

« FTMS Gateways not built at Increment 7

e Awaiting critical OBCS WP2162

Issues

¢ Testing of Increment 7 within the PIT area was not as successful as it might have
been.

e The amount of impending change to baselines across a number of the platforms
may impact the acceptance cycle. Currently it is difficult to quantify the impact ,
because we don't really know the scope of change, and PIT dates.

« Impending tightening of fast-track process is cause for concern. At the moment
there are too many mandatory fast-tracks just to get increment 7 & 7.1 working.

¢ Audit not fully intercepted & risk of intercepting for Final Pass

« Ongoing Reference Data problems (and impact on schedules) cause concern

e If new baseline 9f Increment 7.2 is too big, or too late, it will delay the
Acceptance Pass.

3.2. Y2K (BITO4) ExIT

« External Interface Testing phase started 19/10/98.

e External Interface Testing with CAPS started 26/10/98 — environment reset,
transfer links proven. Input from CAPS has been very poor — files not produced
with all required data, late delivery of files which have caused delays in cycle
progression. Currently manageable within existing plans, but any more slippage
will impact cycle completion. 4 days (out of 10 completed).

¢ No PinlCLs raised in the last week.

Actual Progress Against Plan (version 6)

¢ EXIT testing started on schedule, 19/10/98. ESNS phase complete 26/10/98.

¢ CAPS ExIT testing started on schedule on 26/10/98, but is not progressing well.
End date still (currently) achievable but we are dependent on CAPS to improve
data/processing time/sequences etc.

Issues

¢ Sonnet/FTF links with VME need a work around at this build

e Issues with Reference Data (no Year 2000 Cash Account periods) have been
resolved, and system test Y2K specific reference data generated.

¢ CAPS progress limited

e Hindered by constant inability of CAPS to supply files on time

3.3. BIT Migration
¢ This is the weekly progress report for the BIT Migration team. This week, BIT
Migration Main Pass Cycle2 has begun.

BIT Migration (BITO5, Main Pass Cycle 2, 25 logical day cycle)

e BITO5 was made available with SBOO9 inc 7 on Monday 10.11.98. Reference
data propagation to the correspondence server has been completed. Currently
attempting to establish that we have complete and reliable counter migration
procedures. N.B. This area of testing is unique to BIT Migration. All other teams
in T&l start their testing with fully built counters complete with message stores
populated with reference data. This will manifest itself as an apparent slow start
to this cycle.

Managers’ original input: italics indicate no input received and shows

¢ On the other hand, since there have been no changes to the test 1¢
environment, it has been decided that it is not necessary to repeat the R1c phase
of testing. This consists of 9 logical days, 4 to 5 execution days and 756
conditions. It is proposed to do the same for final pass and the number of days
and conditions reported below have been adjusted accordingly.

Actual Progress Against Plan (Version 6)
e Execution of Main Pass cycle 2 started on schedule on 9.11.98.

Critical Problems

e« A number of issues, thought to be build related are still under investigation at this
early stage. Not yet at the stage where we can establish that the inability to
produce cash accounts has been resolved.

Live Oracle DB Migration Rehearsal

¢ Reg Liddicoat and Steve Bansal performed a rehearsal of the migration of the
live Oracle databases to NR2+ , with Customer Services on their secure
machine. A small number of non-critical issues were discovered and have been
reported to Oracle for investigation and resolution.

Actual Progress Against Plan (Version 6)
This activity is not shown on the plan.

Critical Problems

e The only critical problem was the lack of sufficient tablespace to allow the
pas/cms database to be imported into the NR2 environment. This highlights the
need for a statement from Oracle of exactly how much filestore and tablespace
will be required to allow migration to be completed in the live environment.

e In my view it is essential that a full data centre migration rehearsal, including
correspondence servers , using copies of live data be performed. At least a
week should be allocated and it should be scheduled early enough to allow the
exercise to be repeated at least once prior to Live Trial.

Issues
e It was purely fortuitous that we were able to undertake this exercise between

Main Passes Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. Any future similar exercise need to be
carefully scheduled and properly resourced.

for MOR3 has also had an impact on the progress achieved on BIT Migration
Main Pass Cycle1

1% — 4" Line Support (Last report for 16/10)

Issues

e¢ SMC are not filtering calls to their SLA partially staff training problems and
partially because they have not yet bought the software which would enable
them to look at database problems.

* Currently awaiting confirmation of out-of-hours cover for ICL Pathway
developments from Chris Humphries.

¢ Currently awaiting documentation from ISTL - due this week.

* Currently awaiting details of support contract negotiations with regard to RODB
with Bryan Day.

6. IMPLEMENTATION

User Implementation

Progress

e Training Workbook Reviews. 8 complete, 1 in progress,1 outstanding.

e Dry Run for POCL of Counter Manager’s Course. This will now take place on 9-
10 November

¢ The latest training counter build has been approved by UI and Peritas, and taken
for reproduction to the VC. All 61 will be available for midday Wednesday.

¢ The MOT counter training build will be available for me to check on Monday 9"
November.

e Removable Hard disks for training systems. The 400 disk caddies for our first
phase of training systems have been ordered, for delivery in November in time
for building the live trial systems. They are expected some time this week

Concerns

« Printer Settings. Peritas have asked for the Ithaca printer settings to be included
on the training counter build so they can be downloaded by the trainer, if it is
suspected that there is a problem with the printer. The Verification Centre have
such software but are reluctant to pass it on as they do not wish to support
software which is not theirs.

7. ROLL OUT
Live Trial

« The preparations are continuing in the additional live trial offices and are
scheduled to complete by the end of November.

e Schedules for the necessary remedial work in the 204 outlets have been
produced and the work has now started in offices requiring minor modifications.

Infrastructure Programme

e Surveys are continuing in all implementation programmes broadly in accordance
with the infrastructure plan.

e Resurveys and modifications have been suspended until resolution of a series of
significant process issues that exist within Pearce Securities. Pearce are
cooperating in every way to resolve the situation.

e Preparations have now started in National Rollout offices.

Installation Programme
¢ Not yet started.

Flat Screens

e Initial comments on the prototype flat screens have now been submitted to
Peripheral Product Centre and the issues are being discussed with the supplier.
Continues awaiting feedback from McPherson.

e¢ A modified power input due this week from McPherson.

e An audit report on McPherson has been produced by HPS. Its findings were +ve
except concerns on plans / quality areas, however it indicates overall good
potential

¢ Verification Centre are continuing a full evaluation of flat screens. V0.1 of their
report has been issued . Linklevel (independent testers) are also testing
McPherson and CTX units. An order has been placed with CTX for delivery in
early 99.

« PPC continue to progress the requirement for stands where counters cannot be
drilled

e (i.e. Grade 2 listed counters)

PC Intercept

¢ The proving of PCI cards needs to be undertaken. lan Openshaw will be
contacting lan Morrison to discuss the possibility of testing PC’s with PCI cards
with a view to using them in MOT if acceptable.

Model Office
¢ All installations complete.

RODB Migration
¢ The migration of the RODB to Version 2.5 has been completed, live proving
continues.

Testbed

e The building of the testbed is still progressing. All operating system software has
been installed and the platform software is being installed. The Tivoli
environment build was late in release and will now be built w/c 16.11.98. The
target date for a fully functional test environment is now 30.11.98. (+1wk)

Electronic Weigh Scales

e We have to have a copy of POCL’s “measuring instrument approval certificate”
for weigh scales, a meeting is to be arranged to take this master further he
meeting.

Trolleys

e The ergonomics report has been received and discussions are going on between
Mick Sargeant and the ergonomist re modifications to the trolley to ensure
ergonomic conformance. Design internally is agreed this is to be discussed with
POCL

« There are two offices in the 204, which are currently no solution following survey
to the latest egonomic parameters in which we are currently evaluating the
feasibility of a trolley pilot in.

¢ 5 “can’t do” offices exist where by the solution has been found but require POCL
approval

* 8 ‘won't do” offices are with POCL solutions where by the solution is not
acceptable to Post Masters A meeting is scheduled with POCL for 13/11.

Rollout Risk Management
e¢ Management of the rollout risk register continues. A further meeting of the 300

club is still in the process of being arranged.

WTplc Contract Re-alignment

« A further director’s meeting took place on 10/11/98 , and a final workshop is
scheduled 25"" November 1998.

¢ The timings of upgrades to install NR2 counters are very high and nothing will
now be done to change this for NR2. The potential impact could be that the costs
from EXEL would be very high because the duration of the upgrade may
necessitate circa 20 EXEL teams if only 1 office per day can be achieved for the
period of upgrades. A report is due to outline the details of this and its impact on
LT & NR.

e Preparations are taking longer than anticipated and are running into the evenings
or into a second day even in some of the smaller offices. WTplc is investigating
this.

Non ISDN Offices

e Of the 48 sites, 8 of the sites in Northern Ireland currently do not have kilostream
provision and data provided for 7 sites is inaccurate. BT has committed on
placement of orders, to provide kilostream to the N.I. sites. We are currently
checking inaccurate data provided for the other 7 sites.

8. MIGRATION

POCL HFSOs

Release 1C to NR2 Implementation

e The rescheduled modification programme for the 1c to NR2 upgrade offices
started Tuesday 3/11/98 and continues until the end of Jan’99.

« An overall management document is being developed for the implementation,
awaiting further information, facts and figures, and is being reviewed on Thurs
12/11/98.

¢ One of the main issues still outstanding is the time that the installers and
migration team can gain access into the post offices. Steve Grayston (POCL)
not yet provided a solution.

« Need to discuss and put a contingency plan in place for the migration activities
for 1¢ to NR2 if POCL are doing support only.

Data Centres
e No issues to report

Management Reporting

« POCL have continued to issue their weekly report. The joint monthly report has
been forwarded to POCL recipients but without signoff of content. Issues exist
within POCL as to ownership of their joint weekly format. These are expected to
be resolved in the next two weeks with a joint meeting involving Pathway.

Acceptance

e Acceptance sign off pack is to be delivered to POCL on 13/11/98. WT have
failed despite much cajoling to deliver a number of the outputs. Pearce delivered
within 2 hrs of the request for information.

9. USER SUPPORT

Pathway Liaison Managers

e Three BA staff have been shown around a post office in the North East. This was
arranged via POCL and the PLM asked to attend. Eventually the BA National
Comms Mgr, and 2 National Training and Development Mgrs were present. The
purpose of the visit was to understand how a live office works and to take photo's
for their BA magazine, also, to see what training requirements they may have for
Horizon. This has been raised with Anna Campopiano.

Rollout Help Desk

* Currently averaging 400 calls per week from sub Post Masters, suppliers and our
own project teams in the field.

Live Trial Implementation Activities

¢ 104 Office preps are almost finished: revisits for further work (i.e. joinery) are the
only remaining activities. 204 mods are currently being scheduled.

¢ Scheduling of Live Trial installations (according to the new dates) is currently
being reworked so as to accommodate all Pathway and POCL criteria (i.e. as
regards to daily beat-rate, ECCO/ AP requirements, HFSO limitations etc.).

10. ACCEPTANCE PREP & TESTING

e JCCD still awaiting a response (at home) and should be able to provide a better
update on Friday 13" November.

11. REFERENCE DATA

Live Reference Data

e The ‘Live’ reference populated counters were installed in Farnborough for use by
OSG on the 5th. November. Cash Accounts were produced and printed before
handing over to OSG. Problems with the installed counters have been notified by
OSG. There is an intention of providing a refresh of the counters this week and
later when the MOT software is available.

¢ The ISDN lines have been installed.

Item Transaction mode

« A meeting held in Chesterfield discussed the processes to be implemented to
address the problem of error rejection from TIP. The TIP/Pathway interface
rejects the full transferred file, when any record is found to be erroneous. TIP’s
position is that the specification was signed 2 years ago and any change to the
system requires a change request. Bruce Talmage has agreed to progress this
with Horizon Product QA management. The TIP system also rejects RDS files in
the same way.

Type ‘B’ Interface

Test files of the suggested new format have been received and circulated in
Pathway. It is forecast that a response to RDS, Chesterfield will be made by the
13th. November, 1998.

Interface Support Procedures

e¢ A meeting to discuss the above was held in Chesterfield on the 4th. November. It
was agreed to produce the procedures and interface protocols before the end of
November.

using the system, or, the equipment and the system is not performing as
described in the counter procedures then the Horizon System Helpdesk
should be contacted. The Horizon System Helpdesk will not be able to
offer advice or report faults on Post Office procedures that do not relate to
