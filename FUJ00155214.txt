1.0 Scope of Document

This document defines the process to be followed by the operational security team to meet its
obligations under RS/POL/002 Horizon Security Policy and CS/SER/OI6 the Service
Description for the Security Management Service and applies to Horizon only.

This process is concerned with those actions that the operational security team undertake, all
other processes, guidelines and work instructions are outside the remit of this document,
although a historical background has been included to assist in establishing who and what is
required to enable us to establish this process going forward.

1.1 Political Background

Horizon does not currently analyse logs or events from a security compliance perspective and
concentrates only on availability incidents. This therefore means that the other two areas of
Operational Security Reporting, Confidentiality and Integrity are not picked up. (N.B. this is
because PO Ltd has not set any SLT’s in this area and apart from a generic ISO 27001
compliance contractual statements no requirement exists or has been paid for),

1.2. Technical Background
1.21 Tivoli

Analysis of incidents in Horizon relies mainly on Tivoli Events and not the collection of logs,
with the exception of network devices. Events created by applications and databases are only
collected if they are written to the Operating System Logs, the one exception being Radius
Server Logs

‘Those platforms which have a Tivoli Event adapter, e.g. the data centre servers; counters and
branches forward events through Tivoli Event Consoles to a master Oracle database.

The Tivoli process concentrates on availability and historically the placement of Event
adapters has not been based on risk assessment or an asset register and therefore any future
processes would need to take this into account.

It must also be noted that due to the volume and cost of managing events from the Counter
estate only errors are forwarded from them. For example in the past an assessment of the
impact of auditing of more information (files) on the counter, was made and if such data was
collected approximately 4 a million events per day occurred, if such events are excluded then
there were about 150,000.

All events collected by Tivoli are initially buffered for about 1 hour and are available for
view, and these details are then sent to the archive server to ensure that rules of evidence are
maintained.

A summarised version of the events is maintained online for approximately 10 days and
analysis of availability events is undertaken by SMC. This summary removes all background

noise (redundant, repetitive and uninteresting events) and only events identified as interesting
are retained.

From a security perspective, only log on and log off data is retained as no requests or analysis
has been made for any other requirements and these are therefore seen as background nois

If an increase in the Event collection of Security events is required as shown in section 4.0
then it must be noted that the volume of data collected and the capacity of the platform
holding this information (disk space and memory) and software revision used to manage and
analyse it are key. The current Tivoli version in Horizon is Framework 3.71 and this and the
Oracle Server storing the data may also need upgrading, both of which are planned for HNG-

1.2.2 Networks NMS and Syslog Server

The retention of syslogs is used for network devices. The location of this storage is currently
being moved to a new DNS and syslog server in the Bootle and Wigan data centres from the
old NMS and no analysis is currently undertaken of these logs, although CP 4410 has been
approved and is currently going through the release management process for the use of
Sawmill to analyse Firewall logs. These logs and events are currently not analysed or
included as part of Tivoli.

1.2.3 Service Delivery Unit Analyses

In addition to Tivoli, each of the service delivery units has its own toolsets used for
monitoring the areas of service it is required to provide. On initial investigation this again
mainly covers the area of availability.

The information from these tools is not all currently fed into Tivoli or any other centralised
SIEM to manage and monitor security events or incidents neither are regular reports provided
to Operational Security from these units.

Examples of these tools are:
© HP Openview is used for monitoring the Network

* Cisco Works and TACACS+ are used for managing access and authentication to
network devices

* Athene is used for performance gathering. The Athene data is analysed by the
performance monitoring team within the account (the UNIX team can request reports
etc. from it but the database is in Bracknell and the UNIX team have no direct access)

© Patrol is used for Unix Operating System monitoring - Patrol events are actually fed
into the Tivoli event management systems. Some events will be raised as TFS calls
by SMC and some events may just be stored in the event archives. As previously
stated they are not analysed for Security events and are mainly around availability.

Windows

© Server View is used for monitoring Fujitsu platforms running Windows
© Sophos is used for managing Anti Virus

2.0 Dependencies

To achieve an effective and efficient Event Management solution Operational Security is
dependent on the following

1.

Requirements of reports that PO Ltd want to monitor Operational Security, are agreed
and documented.

Reports required by RMGA to prove operational security compliances are defined and
documented.

. A Fajitsu Services Horizon Security and Control Framework is provided by the

Information Governance Team are provided to SI for Designs.

. The Fujitsu Horizon Security and Control Framework provided by the Information

Governance Team must ensure that any non RMGA support and management systems
used to support RMGA systems and devices meet all Framework requirements.

. SLuse items 1, 2, 3 and any Operational requirements (see below) to provide Design

for Operational Security Incident and Event Monitoring (SIEM) system.

a. SI designs ensure that details of all platforms that require log analysis is
documented and are part of the SIEM system.

b. SI designs ensure that any adapters or agents required for SIEM go through
the Release Management Process and are included in any Physical Platform
Designs

c. SI designs ensure that details of all users, their rights of access and their roles
are documented are easily correlated and are part of the SIEM system.

d. SI designs ensure system owners are identified and documented as part of the
SIEM system

e. SL ensures designs include scheduling to push logs to Central Collection Point
as part of the SIEM system.

£. SI designs ensure Firewalls are configured to accept log pushes
SIEM system,
g. SI designs ensure that Maestro or alternative scheduler is set to schedule the

push of logs to Central Repository as part of the SIEM system and audit report
of failures is available.

part of the

h. SI designs ensure that Central Collection platform (or platforms assuming
resilience is required) has sufficient storage capacity for log storage based on
the retention requirements defined in Fujitsu Services Horizon Security and
Control Framework.

Ref: RS/PRO/049

SI designs include a method of log retention so that the rules of Evidence
requirement cannot be questioned if used in legal proceeding.

SI designs ensure the Central Collection platform have accountability;
authentication; and audit of any access,

. SI designs ensure that the platforms that are used to analyse, and process logs

have sufficient processing power, storage and memory to allow
summarisation, trending and ad hoc queries when required.

SI designs ensure that platforms used to analyse or process reports have
accountability, authentication and audit of both the platform and data/reports
analysed.

SI designs ensure that platforms used to analyse, process or report Event
information are networked and fire-walled and permitted to undertake all
analysis and reporting required

6. Service Delivery Units requirements for Event Capture and event logging are defined
in SLA’s or OLA’s and should include the following Operational Security
requirements :

a.

Service Delivery Units configure endpoint devices to meet the requirements
defined in the SI Design

Service Delivery Units ensure logs are pushed to a Central Collection point
and are in a standardised log analysis format as defined in the SI designs and
ensure that processes are in place to resend any failed log pushes.

Network ‘Teams configure Firewalls and Network equipment to permit the
pushing of logs to the Central Collection Point.

I. Service delivery Units will ensure that they do not manually analysis of logs

will be undertaken by and thus ensure that the segregation of duties between
Operations and Audit takes place.

7. An SIEM Tool is available at all required locations Operational Security work and
permits the following:

a.
b.
C

SIEM Tool details any logs that are missing from any reports undertaken.
SIEM Tool converts logs into a standard format

SIEM Tool allows a series of tests to be run against standardised logs to
produce results

SIEM Tool permits Operational Security to print and export files to Microsoft Office
or alternate tool for summarisation and graphing.

SIEM Tool permits scheduling of both analysis and summary reports against
the key headings in the Fujitsu Services Horizon Security and Control Framework.

3.1 Horizon Security and Control Framework

In the absence of a Horizon Security Framework the principles adopted by other Fujitsu
Service Account Security Frameworks (e.g. NHS), have been provided by the CISO and will
be adopted until one is ready for Horizon and HNG-X and their key points are documented
below to provide a background to this process.

The overall frameworks is split into manageable areas that are in line with Security Policy
sections,

This comprises five main work strands and twenty separate task areas, or control groups, which have
been identified as outlined in the table below. ‘These allow the sets of controls to be organised and
addressed to the audiences who need to work with them, in a more logical and focused way.

3.2. Event Audit Security Control and Framework Requirements

Event Audit is part of the overall control framework and cannot be considered in isolation in
particular it relates to other key controls shown below and these are keys areas that
Operational Security needs to report back to both the CISO and PO Ltd on.

Operating Systems;

Back-up and Media Management;
Off-site Issues;

Networks;

Access Management;

Solutions Design;

Risk Management;

Legal & Contractual, and;
Security Incident Management.

‘The controls in the framework are not intended to be detailed operating procedures or technology-
specific security or build standards ~ these will be drafted by specific operational, delivery or
technical teams, hence this operational process. An initial assessment has been undertaken with the
Tivoli staff to assess whether the information is currently available or whether development work
would be required in Horizon and this is shown in the last column.

‘The controls in the framework outlined are not therefore exhaustive and do not remove the need to
comply with the security requirements in the contract or CS/SER/O16 Service Description for the
Security Management Service. ‘The controls proposed are not simply technical security
countermeasures. They also cover:

© Organisational controls (roles, responsibilities, structures, reporting lines, etc);

© Procedural (prescribed, documented standardised methods and processes for performing
functions, aimed at ensuring consistency and repeatability of performance, potentially
reinforced by training and awareness);

© Technical controls (automated controls, in-built to systems and applications, controlling
logical or physical access, or monitoring activity — these help ensure consistent operation of
the control by placing less reliance on the human element for their deployment and use);

© People-based controls (vetting/clearances, awareness, supervision, review).

kept for an agreed period, in accordance with
policy or guidance, to assist in future
investigations and access control monitoring.

Audit logs shall be produced for different
categories of system access and event, such
as:

1, Logs for remote access.

2. Logs for standard user access to
‘management information.

3. Logs for users on support systems, logs
for Privileged users on support systems.

4, Logs for privileged users on RMGA
systems.

5. Logs for PO Ltd users,

Access to Audit Logs shall be strictly
controlled and shall be protected from
deletion, disablement, modification or

3.4 Operational Security Framework implementation.

The first process that the Operational Security team undertake prior to running any reports is
a check that all logs are present and available.

If these logs are unavailable then the Service Delivery Manager responsible for that SDU is
informed and a Security incident is raised.

Dependent on the control requirements established in the Security Framework a series of tests
are undertaken for each platform and log type to assess whether it passes or fails a particular
control requirement on that individual log.

Each test is:
Given a unique number,
¢ Given a description,
¢ Given a test definition,
© Given a successful test criteria
« Validated
¢ Result of Yes or No fora successful test

Dependent on the type of control for example test 1.1 could be a test for a successfull logon
and this would apply whether the source of the log was a Windows, UNIX, Application,
Database or Network device.

Incident Management Process.

(DN. The process to do this will need further investigation as some SDU teams do not have
access to PEAK which would be the RMGA preferred option)

3.5 Tests

Within Horizon currently no event testing is undertaken and therefore an initial baseline of
test has been obtained from another Fujitsu account as a starting point for discussion with the
relevant Service Delivery Managers, Operation Unit Managers and ISD SDU units and will

3.6 Reports

3.6.1 Summary Reports

‘The CISO and Operational Security Team agree regular delivery dates for agreed summary
reports required for PO Ltd and those that are required for intemal RMGA compliance
management.

3.6.2 Compliance Report

Those required for compliance management are to be sent to Information Governance as
Audit Records.

Initially the intention is to summarise the compliance test results to the number of pass or
fails, collected based on the Horizon Security and Control Framework criterion and the ISO
27001 reference this will need to be agreed with Information Governance.

The Fujitsu Services guideline document shows that the recommended SIEM solution
provides COTS off the shelf templates for the reports detailed below. RMGA CISO in
conjunction with PO Ltd needs to decide which of these they will require, and Information
Governance in conjunction with Operational Security also needs to agree which they want. I
have deleted those cells I believe are not applicable to RMGA and have included the full set
as an appendix, but this area is open to debate, by all interested parties. In addition I have
included those platforms which will be introduced as part of the migration to HNG-X.

3.6.3 Operational Security Management and ad hoc Reports

Currently the only Security Event analysis reports that Operational Security can produce are
ad hoc reports when provided with a correctly formatted log.

Managed and scheduled Event and Incident Summary Reports need to be agreed with
Operational Security Manager and initially these reports need to highlight breaches in
Confidentiality, Integrity or availability by Service Delivery Unit with drill down facilities if
required.

Key areas that these and ad hoc reports need to consider for summarisation dependent on the
type of log analysed are

* Date and time Summaries
* Log Source summaries
«Types of Event Summaries

¢ Event Categorisation Summaries

« Event Number Summaries

ent User Summaries

© Computer or device summaries

* Event Description Summaries

© Trended Summary

© Overall Summary of each of above category

The use of Sawmill a tool which Operational Security already has would give much of the
required output on an ad hoc basis if original logs were available and an audit plan of
platforms based on risk provided.

Sawmill Proof of Concept
A proof of concept into its use has been undertaken with
© CSV output logs for Windows NT Events
* CSV output logs for Windows 2000 Events
*  Syslogs fiom Solaris

*  Syslogs fiom Cisco Routers

© Syslogs fiom Cisco Firewalls

To assess whether this is feasible and summary results are documented as an appendix to this
document.

4.0 Audit

This process is subject to PCI and ISO 27001 Audit which is arranged by the Security and
Governance Team.

However, in order to provide some guidelines as to the key areas that Operational Security
needs to analyse to assess whether a Security Incident has occurred the following areas are
considered key, the item also shows other sources of base data that needs to be used to
confirm the validity of the output:

1. Identify that only authorised users are accessing the platforms their roles permit them
to do so — Event log Analysis and PVCS documentation

2. Identify that only authorised platforms (i.e. Names and IP’s) access the network —
PVCS documentation, Networks IP List and Event logs

3. Identify any unauthorised use of ports and protocols — Analysis of Event logs and
PVCS documentation

4. Identify any changes that take place without a Change Control - e.g. CP or OCP both
to Operating Systems and Applications — Audits and check against CP and OCP data
for any actions taken and Nessus passive scans to see what is still outstanding

5. Identify any vulnerabilities on platforms particularly those identified by the supplier
as Critical or High - MBSA and OVAL runs on targeted at risk platforms
