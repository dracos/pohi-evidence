Impact statements must consider all transitional states between Horizon and HNG-X, as well as the
final HNG-X solution.

Description of Change Proposed:

The Audit system supports a service (the Prosecution Support Service) whereby POL can request an
extract of historical data that is held within the Audit archive. Typically this requires retrieval of archived
Riposte transaction data. The data, as returned to POL, is often used to support legal proceedings
where, say, a postmaster is accused of fraud. In such cases, we must also provide a witness
statement with the audit data which attests to its provenance and integrity.

Historically, the Horizon Audit service has relied solely on the retrieval & analysis of archived Riposte
message store data when servicing POL audit data requests for Horizon branch transaction data. A
recent issue (PC0152376) has identified a deficiency in this approach. In certain failure scenarios, it is
possible that the Horizon counter may write an inconsistent set of messages to the local message
store. This casts a doubt over the overall integrity of the resulting transaction data.

When a Horizon counter hits one of the above mentioned failure scenarios, an NT event message is
written to the local event log. This event is captured by Sysman & relayed to the central Sysman
events database. This event data is subsequently secured in the Audit archive. A tactical solution has
been incorporated into the Horizon Audit retrieval process to provide a short term resolution to this
problem. For every branch Riposte data retrieval, the archived events generated by counters at the
branch are also analysed to identify any possible occurrences of problems which might adversely affect
the integrity of the transaction data

The current Horizon tactical solution is a largely manual process, the operation of which is reliant on a
few key individuals. Whilst we believe that we will have to live with this tactical solution for the
remaining life of the Horizon Audit system, a permanent solution for the HNG-X Audit solution is
required. In outline, this will require the following

retrieve and filter Events data when performing Horizon branch data retrievals."

> Amending the HNG-X Audit server (ARC) and workstation (AUW) applications to automatically
retrieve and filter Events data when performing HNG-X branch data retrievals.’

> Introduce Prosecution Support process changes around the operation of the amended system
& the production of witness statements.

> Identify suitable skilled & committed resources to perform any manual analysis required.

> Identify all ongoing operational costs associated with operating the revised service.

The attached diagram illustrates the required changes.

ProcessOverview. vs

Acceptance Criteria and Methods (Functional and Non Functional):
Testing will be required to ensure that all suspect counter events are extracted by the system and
presented to the Audit workstation user for further analysis

Reason for Change and Justification for Required Date (above):
While we do not believe that (due to time constraints) it is practicable to introduce this change into
Horizon, it is required to ensure the viability of the ongoing Prosecution Support service within HNG-X.

The changes will be required to be present within the initial live version of the HNG-X Audit system at
Weekend D

' The HNG-X Audit solution will need to continue to support the retrieval & analysis of Horizon branch audit data
for seven years

? While there is no reason to believe that the HNG-X counter will suffer the same deficiencies as the Horizon
counter, it is advisable that similar checks are performed in both environments
