Steve, I think you are right — we haven’t yet covered off the MSC question, despite what Jonny just said.

Below is where we were up to in the discussion. As he has said he is happy, shall we let it lie for a bit and see if it
comes up again? Or shall we provide what we have worked out below?

It still seems a low. The trouble is the systems were not designed for this kind of retrospective interrogation and just
don’t support it. There is no tag on an incident or change control which classifies the kind of remedial action needed,
the description of any remedial action can be in a number of places. For example:
a) You may have a documented process (e.g. a work instruction) that says “use privileged role to.......”. The
change control for it may just say “apply change as documented in DOCREF”.
b) Your descriptive info in in the incident, the change control may just say “apply change documented in
PCnnnnnn”

I think that we need to give the claimants the results of this search while:
a) Clearly telling them the criteria used to search
b) Caveating that we do not believe it is complete and that it is not practical to return a complete list because
they would require applying a mark one eyeball to all 220,000 peaks

Hi, that gives an additional 61, as the attached file (repasted to reduce file size).

It includes the example that Steve cites below, of 0430444374.

So we’d need to supply them with that new sheet that Dave just obtained, but do we think that covers it?

For the use of AppSup with full MSCs, that’s a reasonable number BUT I’m surprised that the search is not throwing up
any sub-tasks.

WI625N (attached) documents the MSC masters in use by the SSC up to MSC demise. Randomly following the 2016
master 04330444374 on to the referenced sub task 043T0090966 you can clearly see appsup in the text:

Counter 1 at branch 180941 is stuck in a ‘recovery loop' so it is therefore unable to be used to trade.
In order to get the counter operational the following SQL needs to be run to delete the stuck recovery records...

set role appsup;

delete

from opsSbrdb.brdb_rx_recovery_transactions

where branch_accounting_code = 180941

and fad_hash = 125

and node_id = 1

and settlement_complete_timestamp is null;

commit;

This has be authorised by POL (Andrew Winn) Call Reference PCO250836

Not sure if this is an issue with the data set or the search method?

On the attachment, descriptions are taken from the file “MSC_Description_POA__14_ Dec_2018.xlsx” and cross
referenced to “MSC_Complete_data_14_Dec_2018” to obtain the title and date.

There are ten listed, the last one being the only MSC with APPSUP in its title, 043J0451867, “LIVE - Remove access to
APPSUP database role from SSC users”, so actually isn’t relevant. That leaves nine examples, five of which are from
2010.

Does this sound realistically like it might be all there is, or is it thought there should be more than this that aren’t
being picked up?

Hi Matthew
Happy New Year.

We are currently dealing with a number of disclosure requests from Freeths, one of which relates to documents
referred to by Post Office's witnesses’ statements for the Horizon Issues Trial. It would be brilliant if you could help me
in the first instance with those documents referred to by Torstein Godeseth and Andy Dunks.

1. Oracle audit table

Freeths have specifically requested a copy of the record of alterations to the Oracle audit table, which includes
all access and actions carried out by privileged users. Are you able to:

a) confirm if a record of alterations exists and, if so, provide us with a copy of the same; and

b) if the record of alterations does not exist, provide us with a copy of the Oracle audit table?
[Matthew Lenton] An extract of the Oracle audit table was provided to WBD on a hard disk / USB stick on 26-Sep-
2018; Lucy may recall that this was the set of data that we provided with a macro so that the .AUD files could be
opened using Excel.
Alterations are not made to this table by users, although there is an automated daily purge of data as described in
DES/APP/HLD/0020, section 7.2.4, “Audit, Archive & Purge (Application BRDBC004)”, which is itself recorded in the
table, where the column ‘objSname’ = “AUD$”, in the column ‘action#’, by the codes 3 (SELECT) and 7 (DELETE); this
record then remains in the table permanently.

2. Managed Service Change (MSC) sign off documents (prior to July 2015)

We disclosed the MSC logs on 21 December 2018. Freeths are now seeking disclosure of the documents that
were signed off and attached to the MSC logs prior to July 2015. We note that you have already provided us
with the output from the New Change Form and a power point which shows the forms on the database and the
fields after completion. Is there anything else we don't have in relation to their request?

[Matthew Lenton] We are still looking into this. Perhaps you could confirm that what you are looking for is the

documents attached to MSCs specifically in relation to para 59.6 of Torstein’s statement?

Yes, we are looking for the log on and log off records attached to the MSCs as referenced in para 59.6 of Torstein's
FUJ00188147
FUJ00188147

statement. Relevant paragraph below for ease of reference:

59.6: "Prior to July 2015 the log on and log off activities by Privileged Users were audited. The process was for
a Managed Service Change (MSC)14 document to be signed off and for the log on and log off records to be
attached to the MSC."

3. Problem review tracker (forum between Atos and POL)

Freeths have asked for a copy of the Problem Review Tracker which documents the forum meetings between
Fujitsu/ POL/ Atos and is shared with Atos weekly. Is there a tracker or is this information contained in the
documents that you uploaded to High Q under "Fujitsu Problem Reports"? Do they/any tracker show closed
issues? If not, we will need historic versions too.

[Matthew Lenton] Yes, the documentation uploaded to HighQ in the Fujitsu Problem Reports folder is the week by
week instance of the Problem Review Tracker. From around October 2012, the work books contain sheets named
“Closed Problems” and I believe that these are retained, so that the most recent version includes all of the problems
closed since Oct 2012.

4. Fujitsu security policy

Freeths have requested a copy of the Fujitsu's Post Office Account Security Policy. Are you able to provide
this?
[Matthew Lenton] This is document reference SVM/SEC/POL/0003, all versions of which have already been
provided.

In terms of timescales, Freeths have requested we respond to the above by no later than 4 January 2019. It would
therefore be brilliant if you could come back to us as soon as you are able to — ideally within 24 hours. If this is not
achievable, I should be grateful if you would confirm when you anticipate being able to provide the documents.

Kind regards
