Directed Surveillance

1. Introduction

1.1 Directed Surveillance Under RIPA. The Regulation of investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) provides a
statutory framework for the authorisation of Directed Surveillance (DS) by “Relevant Public Authorities”.
Royal Mail Group Ltd (RMG Ltd) is a Relevant Public Authority (RPA) as a universal service provider,
within the meaning of the Postal Services Act 2000, but only when acting in connection with the
provision of the universal postal service. This is because the provision of a national postal service is a
public function, but all other activities carried out by RMG Ltd are the activities of a private business and
as such are outside the authority of RIPA. Parcelforce Worldwide delivery and collection network is not
part of the universal postal service and as such DS in investigations into theft from that network fall
outside of RIPA.

1.2 Without an appropriate RIPA authority, any DS conducted in connection with the provision of the
universal postal service by RMG Ltd, could amount to an unlawful interference with a person's Article 8
Rights, “the right to respect for private and family life” under the Human Rights Act 1998.

13 Directed Surveillance Outside of RIPA. It is the policy of RMG Ltd that all cases which require DS should
be subject to the same stringent safeguards to ensure consistent evaluation of proportionality and
necessity prior to any interference with a person's private or family life. Accordingly the process to obtain
DS authority in non-RIPA cases will mirror the processes in RIPA cases.

1.4 Scotland. Investigators conducting investigations in Scotland should note that RMG Ltd is not scheduled
as a RPA under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000. !t is however a RPA in all
parts of the United Kingdom under RIPA 2000. The authority under RIPA 2000 which allows DS
authorities to extend to Scotland can be found in “The Regulation of Investigatory Powers
(Authorisations Extending to Scotland) Orders 2000 & 2007”. As such, all RIPA and non-RIPA DS in
Scotland should be conducted in accordance with RIPA 2000 and the Covert Surveillance & Property
Interference Code of Practice.

1.5 The RIPA 2000 Covert Surveillance & Property Interference Code of Practice (CS&PI CoP) is associated
with these Procedures & Standards. Oversight of the conduct of covert surveillance and covert human
intelligence sources by public authorities is maintained by The Office of Surveillance Commissioners
(OSC). The Surveillance Commissioners website www.surveillancecommissioners.gov.uk, provides advice
and guidance for relevant public authorities such as RMG Ltd, with a number of useful links to other
relevant sources of information.

1.6 Group Security Forms. The most recent version of the following forms must be used at all times and are
available on the Royal Mail Security SharePoint Site.
GSO95 Application for authority to carry out Directed Surveillance.
GS095a Application to review authority to carry out Directed Surveillance.
GSO95b Application to renew authority to carry out Directed Surveillance.
GSO95c Application to cancel authority to carry out Directed Surveillance.

GS096 Authority for 3" parties to conduct Directed Surveillance.
GS097 Authority Log (record maintained by Authorising Officers).
GS098 Urgent Oral Authorisation Booklet (booklet completed by Authorising Officers).

2. What is Directed Surveillance?

2.1 In order to accurately assess the need for an authority to carry out DS, it is imperative that Investigators
have a clear understanding of what constitutes DS. In circumstances whereby the proposed activity does
not fall within the definition, then an authority would not be necessary. If there is any doubt as to
whether the intended activity constitutes DS, advice must be sought from an Authorising Officer (AO).

3.7

Directed Surveillance (defined by Section 26(2) of RIPA 2000). Is surveillance which is covert (see 3.1

below) but not intrusive (see 3.2 below) and undertaken:

2.2.1 For the purpose of a specific investigation or a specific operation;

2.2.2 In such a manner as is likely to result in the obtaining of private information about a person
(whether or not one specifically identified for the purpose of the investigation or operation); and

2.2.3 Otherwise than by way of an immediate response to events or circumstances the nature of which
is such that it would not be reasonably practical for an authorisation to be sought for the carrying
out of the surveillance.

Important. The failure to properly categorise what is DS may result in the Human Rights of others being
breached and potentially lead to litigation action against the Business and/or individuals. Furthermore,
significant and incriminating evidence obtained in such circumstances may be subject to challenge and
potentially held as inadmissible in Court (Section 78 Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE)). DS
must be authorised as described in Section 4 below.

Under no circumstances must a third party be asked to carry out any activity that may be construed as
DS without the appropriate authority being obtained.

Terminology, Definitions and General

Covert Surveillance (defined by Section 26(9a) of RIPA 2000). Surveillance is covert if, and only if, it is
carried out in a manner that is calculated to ensure that persons who are subject to the surveillance are
unaware that it is or may be taking place. (This includes the use of overt CCTV systems for the purposes
of a specific investigation or operation).

Intrusive Surveillance (defined by Section 26(3) of RIPA 2000). Surveillance is ‘intrusive’ if it is covert

surveillance that;

3.2.1 Is carried out in relation to anything taking place on any residential premises or in any private
vehicle and

3.2.2. Involves the presence of an individual on the premises or in the vehicle or is carried out by means
of a surveillance device.

RMG Ltd has no authority to perform ‘Intrusive Surveillance’ under any circumstances. It is therefore
vital that Investigators understand what constitutes ‘Intrusive Surveillance’. Additionally RMG Ltd has no
power under the Police Act 1997 to “interfere with property’.

Private information (defined by Section 26(40) of RIPA 2000). Includes information relating to a person's
private or family life. This includes an individual's private or personal relationships with others and
extends beyond the formal relationships created by marriage.

Collateral Intrusion (CS&PI CoP 3.8 to 3.10 refer). The term collateral intrusion is used to describe the
potential invasion of privacy, of any other persons who are not the subject or target of the surveillance.
(See 4.19 to 4.21 below).

Necessity and Proportionality (CS&PI CoP 3.3 to 3.7 refers). The terms necessity and proportionality
have given rise to much debate. There is a common misunderstanding when it comes to differentiating
between the two. In the first instance, the AO must believe that the proposed surveillance is necessary
for one of the statutory grounds/reasons provided by Section 28(3) of RIPA 2000. RMG Ltd as a RPA is
restricted to the use of RIPA 2000 powers for the purpose of “preventing or detecting crime or
preventing disorder” only, as set out in Section 28(3b) of the Act.

Once satisfied that it is ‘necessary’ in the particular case under investigation, the AO must believe that
the proposed activity is in fact ‘proportionate’ to what it seeks to achieve. This involves balancing the
seriousness of the intrusion into the privacy of the target of the operation (or any other person who may
be affected) against the need for the activity in investigative and operational terms.

© Royal Mail 2012 - 6:1 Directed Survellance- RM V3.0 ~Page 5 of 17

POL00094132
POL00094132

3.8 Guidance on Proportionality is given in the CoP (CS&PI CoP 3.5), as follows. 7he authorisation will not
Le proportionate if it is excessive in the overall circumstances of the case. Each action authorised should
ring an expected benefit to the investigation or operation and should not be disproportionate or
arbitrary. The fact that a suspected offence may be serious will not alone render intrusive actions
proportionate. Similarly, an offence may be so minor that any deployment of covert techniques would be
disproportionate. No activity should be considered proportionate if the information which is sought could
reasonably be obtained hy other less intrusive means.

3.9 The following elements of proportionality should therefore be considered:

3.9.1 Balancing the size and scope of the proposed activity against the gravity and extent of the
perceived crime or offence;

3.9.2 Explaining how and why the methods to be adopted will cause the least possible intrusion on the
target and others; ,

3.9.3 Considering whether the activity is an appropriate use of the legislation and a reasonable way,
having considered all reasonable alternatives, of obtaining the necessary result;

3.9.4 Evidencing, as far as reasonably practicable, what other methods had been considered and why
they were not implemented.

3.10 Further explanation and guidance on proportionality is provided at 4.14 to 4.18 below.

3.14 Confidential Information/Material (CS&PI CoP 4.1 & 4.28 refers). Is defined as being,

3.11.AMatters subject to legal privilege, or

3.11.2Communications between a Member of Parliament and another person on constituency matters.
(References to a Member of Parliament include references to Members of both Houses of the UK
Parliament, the European & Scottish Parliament and the Welsh & Northern Ireland Assemblies), or

3.14.3Confidential personal information, such as details of the subject's spiritual, welfare or medical
condition, or

3.11.4Confidential journalistic material.

3.12 If confidential material is acquired or retained during DS which was unplanned then the matter must be
reported to the Senior Investigation Manager Policy and Standards on 020 7881 4313. In cases where
it is thought likely that as a consequence of DS a person may acquire knowledge of “confidential
material”, special authorisation would be required. In such cases, the AO would be the Director of Group
Security. The processes for the handling, recording, disposal and/or destruction of such confidential
material, will be determined when authorised or when retained and this may require advice from the
Criminal Law Team (CLT).

3.13 Further explanation and guidance is provided at paragraph 4.22 below.

3.14 Product of Surveillance (CS&PI CoP 9.5 refers). There is nothing in RIPA 2000 that prevents material
obtained from properly authorised surveillance being used in other investigations or proceedings,
(including civil and disciplinary). Investigators must ensure that all evidence and/or intelligence gathered
(i.e. the product of the DS operation), is handled, stored or destroyed in accordance with the instructions
given by the AO when the surveillance authorisation is cancelled using the GS095c procedure.

3.15 Authorising Officer. An AO in respect of DS is deemed by legislation as being a ‘Senior Investigation
Manager’. Within Royal Mail Group Ltd this is determined as being a Senior Investigation Manager of

BPC8 level or above.

3.16 Note - In some circumstances, the Director of Group Security may allow persons temporarily promoted
to BPC8 level or higher, to be recognised as AO.

3.17 Durations of Authorisations (CS&PI CoP 5.10 & 5.114 refers). A written application granted by an AO will
cease to have effect (unless renewed) at the end of a period of three months beginning with the day on
which it took effect. (See 4.23.12 below). Urgent oral authorisations cease to have effect after 72 hours.
(See 3.24 below).

© Royal Mail 2012 ~ 6:1 Directed Survellance- RM V3.0 Page 6 of 17
POL00094132
POL00094132

3.18 Note: Once any authority has expired, a new application form GSO95 is required.

3.19 Immediate Response. Remember the definition of Directed Surveillance (see 2.2 above), takes account
of “an immediate response to events or circumstances”, which, by their very nature, could not have been
foreseen’. Such ‘immediate response’ circumstances are not ‘Directed Surveillance’, and would therefore
not require an Urgent Oral Authority.

3.20 There is no case law to assist in defining when the immediate response ends and an urgent oral
authority should be requested. To ensure good governance Investigators should apply for urgent oral
authority as soon as it is reasonably practicable, without compromising the quality of the possible
evidence.

3.21 Urgent Oral Authorities It is recognised that urgent situations will arise whereby it is not possible to
prepare and submit a written application to carry out DS. In such situations, an AO may grant oral
authority to carry out specific activities. These circumstances are likely to be very few and far between
within RMG Ltd.

3.22 Urgent Oral Authority Applications. In circumstances that warrant urgent oral authority, the AO is
required to complete an Urgent Oral Authorisation form GS098. An aide memoir to the GSO098 has been
produced to inform the Investigator of the likely questions that they will be asked. The Applicant must
make a written record, as soon as is reasonably practicable, preferably in an official notebook, detailing;
3.22.1 The identities of the subject(s) of the surveillance.

3.22.2’ The exact nature of the surveillance operation authorised. (To include details of AO and time
authorised)

3.22.3 The reason the AO considered the case urgent.

The applicant must then ensure that all involved in the Surveillance team are briefed on the exact

nature and the extent of the surveillance activities authorised and make a written record to this effect.

3.23 Guidance on Urgent Cases is given in the CoP (CS&PI CoP 8.8), as follows; case is not normally to be
regarded as urgent unless the time that would elapse before the authorising officer was available to
grant the authorisation would, in the judgement of the person giving the authorisation, be likely to
endanger life or jeopardise the investigation or operation for which the authorisation was being given. An
authorisation is not to be regarded as urgent where the need for an authorisation has been neglected or
the urgency is of the authorising officer's own making.”

3.24 Oral authority will cease to have effect after 72 hours from the time the authorisation was granted. For
surveillance to continue beyond the 72 hours then authority for renewal must be sought using the form
GSO95b.

3.25 Note: If as a result of the authority, the operation is resolved, then a cancellation form GSO95c must be
completed by the Investigator in the case and submitted to the AO as soon as practicable.

4. Written Applications for authority to carry out Directed Surveillance

4.1 Directed Surveillance, as defined at 2.2 above, can only be authorised if the AO considers it to be both
necessary and proportionate to preventing or detecting crime, and that issues of both collateral intrusion
and confidential material have been considered.

4.2. Note: It is useful to remember that the GS095 application, must provide the AO with accurate
information that determines - Who, What, Where, When, Why and How.

4.3 The following paragraphs aim to provide advice and guidance in general terms. Clearly it is not possible
to take every eventuality into account and any uncertainty should be discussed with an AO before action
is taken. Additionally Investigators should remember that each application should be considered in
isolation and as such they should avoid “cut and paste” when completing applications.

POL00094132
POL00094132

4.4 [Part 1- Application for authority to carry out Directed Surveillance]

4.4.1 The ‘Authorisation No.’ is a unique number generated by the AO. In RIPA applications it will
consist of the Authorising Officer's Security Identity Card number, a consecutive running number
of applications considered by the AO for that calendar year and finally the current year. In non-
RIPA cases the number will commence “NR”. Important note. RIPA and non-RIPA application
numbers must be totally separate. For example if the Authorising Officer's security card number
is 456 the first RIPA Application will be 456/001/2009, the second 456/002/2009. The first non-
RIPA application will be NR456/001/2009 and not NR456/003/2009.

4.4.2. The Investigator must indicate whether the application for DS is in accordance with RIPA 2000, in
that it is connected with the provision of the Universal Postal Service. (If in doubt the matter
should be discussed with an AO)

4.4.3 The ‘Case Reference’ is that raised by the SIMS system. The ‘Event Number’ should only be used if
unavoidable.

45 [Part 2 - Identify on which grounds the Directed Surveillance is necessary. (CS&PI CoP 3.3 tefers)I
As detailed at 3.6 above, the AO must believe that the proposed surveillance is necessary. The only
statutory grounds under RIPA 2000, for which it is necessary for RMG Ltd as a RPA to conduct DS, is for
the purpose of preventing or detecting crime. This will also be the only reason for non-RIPA DS
applications. The form already details this reason.

4.6 IPart 3-The Identities, where known, of those to be subject of the Directed Surveillance]

(CS&PI CoP 5.8 refers)
4.6.1 This part is largely self-explanatory. Where more than two subjects are involved, additional rows
should be created.

4.6.2 If the identity of a subject is not known, it is permissible to modify the sub-headings to cater for
the circumstances (e.g. ‘description’ or ‘other info’)

4,7 IPart 4 - Describe the crime under investigation, the evidence gathered, how the suspect is implicated]

land the reasons why the authorisation is necessary in this particular case.(CS&PI CoP 5.8 refers}

Provide a concise explanation including;

4.7.1 What crime is being investigated (e.g. theft of mail at a particular Delivery Office (DO) - contrary
to S1 of the Theft Act 1968).

4.7.2. How the criminal activity came to light (e.g. customer complaints or debris found).

4.7.3. Evidence of current criminal activity (e.g. continuing loss levels).

4.7.4 What evidence links the subject with the current criminal activity (e.g. analysis or Due Course
Delivery Officer (DCDO)).

4.7.5 What evidence is the DS expected to provide.

4.7.6 How the evidence or information being sought will materially assist the investigation.

4.8 Remember: The purpose of your submission is to justify the need to carry out the DS. Avoid the use of
unnecessary detail and any specific investigation methodology. You will have the opportunity elsewhere
to demonstrate how thorough your investigation has been. In completing the application Investigators
should avoid vague terms that raise questions for the reader and avoid/clarify any ‘business’ jargon.

4.9 IPart 5 ~ During the course of the investigation has further information or intelligence been obtained]

from the National Intelligence I Database or “or the ISR that the AO should be made aware of?
Under no circumstances must any information be included in the application that could identify an
individual registered on the Intelligence Source Register (ISR) or a Police Covert Human Intelligence
Source (CHIS). In these situations only the ISR/CHIS unique reference number (URN) must be stated.
The URN will allow the AO to ascertain and examine the information concerned.

4.10 [Part 6 ~ Describe the surveillance operation to be authorised including equipment to be used]

© Royal Mail 2012 ~ 6.4 Directed Surveilance- RM V3.0 ~Page 8 of 17
POL00094132
POL00094132

Whilst being succinct and to the point, provide an overview of the proposed operation. Specific detail of
the operation and who is doing what and how should not be included. Limit your description to a
general summary of what the operation will involve and the potential for developments in the case. This
should include;

4.10.1 Anticipated times and expected duration of surveillance activity.

4.10.2 Number of Investigators involved.

4.10.3 Where the proposed surveillance is to take place, e.g. DO, delivery route to home address and
any deviation from this. If relevant, Investigators should allow for developments in terms of
potential new subjects, locations and tactics. See paragraph 4.11 below.

4.10.4 Premises to be used for the surveillance (do not identify any confidential locations). See
paragraph 6.1 below dealing with the confidentiality of observation points in accordance with R
v Johnson.

4.10.5 Number of vehicles to be utilised.

4.10.6 Equipment to be utilised (e.g. CCTV, still cameras, binoculars, camcorder and electronic tracking
devices) including the scope and coverage if this is applicable.

4.10.7 In cases which require a covert camera(s) to be installed it is important that precise detail of the
extent of the coverage is contained in the application. Where possible best practice will be to
provide the AO with a floor plan/sketch of the area to be covered by the covert camera(s). See
paragraph 4.19 in respect of collateral intrusion and Part 13 at paragraphs 4.25 & 4.26 below
in respect of the installation engineer's role.

4.11 The Developing Operation. Where appropriate the original application should include details of potential
developments in the surveillance operation which allows Investigators to act quickly, without losing sight
of a suspect(s) and risking the continuity of evidence. For example, where the subject is not known, or
there is a possibility that additional subjects may be involved, the application should be worded in such a
way that it allows for the operation to continue and/or expand should a subject or additional subjects be
identified. Unless the continued activity leads to an apprehension (in which case a cancellation is likely to
be appropriate) a review should be submitted as soon as reasonably practicable recording the details and
impact of the development. This must be done and authorised before further DS activity takes place.

4,12 Reviews and renewals should not add new suspects, locations or tactics to the authorisation unless
these were clearly stipulated as potential fully justified additions within the wording of the original
application. If not a fresh application must be submitted.

4.43 [Part 7 - What is the defined objective of the Directed Surveillance? (CS&PI CoP 5.8 refers) I
The defined objective may be;
4.13.1 To gather evidence which will prove or disprove the subject’s involvement in the crime under
investigation or,
4.13.2 To identify the person responsible for crime under investigation.

4.14 [Part 8 — Explain why this Directed Surveillance is proportionate to what it seeks to achieve]

(CS&PI CoP 3.6 refers)

You will have already explained the ‘need’ for the proposed surveillance, in terms of evidential value, in
Parts 2 & 4 of the application. You are now required to demonstrate that the proposed surveillance is
in fact proportionate. In other words, that the potential intrusion on the subject's privacy, is fair and
reasonable in the circumstances. To reiterate the explanation at 1.2 above - the focus of this legislation
is one of fairness and regard for an individuals ‘right to respect for private and family life’.

4,15 The following points may help position what explanation is required;
4.15.1 The proposed activity must be proportionate when balanced against the seriousness of the
offence and the defined objective.
4.15.2 The level of ‘intrusion’ on the subject of the surveillance, and others, is the key issue.
4.15.3 The level of ‘intrusion’ must be kept to a minimum.

© Royal Mail 2012-64 Drrected Surveilance- RM V3.0~Page 9 of 17

POL00094132
POL00094132

4.16 Demonstrate that you have considered;

4.16.1 Other ways or methods of obtaining the required evidence, which would not be as intrusive, and
why they have been discounted.

4.16.2 Why there is a need for adopting a ‘covert’ means of securing the evidence, rather than a more
open, less intrusive approach and is this most appropriate.

4.16.3 The subject's expectation of privacy within the areas they will be under surveillance.

4.16.4 The scale of the operation and size of the surveillance team compared with the gravity and
extent of offending.

4.16.5 How all of the above points are proportionate when balanced against the objective.

4,17 In relation to point 4.16.3 above, Investigators may consider the impact of CCTV and signage on the
level of privacy expected by the subject. Clearly a higher expectation of privacy would exist in areas such
as welfare rooms, prayer rooms, locker rooms and vehicles. You should provide increased justification
for the intrusion if this is the case.

4,18 In other words the Human Rights of others are being preserved by keeping the surveillance to a
minimum whilst being sufficient to achieve its purpose in obtaining the evidence or information
necessary to support the investigation.

4.19 [Part 9 - Supply details of any potential collateral intrusions and what precautions you will take to
Iminimise or avoid this happening. (CS&PI CoP 3.8 to 3.14 tefers)I

As defined at 3.5 above, collateral intrusion is the ‘incidental invasion of the privacy of those not the
direct target of surveillance’ and understandably the applicant must demonstrate that the potential for
this happening has been considered and measures taken to minimise it.

4,20 Provide an assessment of the risk of collateral intrusion by;
4.20.1 Outlining who may be affected and why.
4.20.2 How it is intended to ensure that any unavoidable collateral intrusion is kept to a minimum.

4.21 Note: In circumstances whereby an area is targeted with no specific suspect, collateral intrusion does
not apply to those working within that area.

4.22 IPart 10 - Confidential Information - Is it likely that the Directed Surveillance will result in thel
lacquisition of any of the following? (CS&PI CoP Chapter 4 refers}

Clearly indicate either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ against each of the four types of information listed. In the event of
the answer to any of the questions being ‘Yes’, you must provide a description of the
material/information concerned and explain how it will be handled. Advice on this matter may be
sought from the CLT. Where there is any intention or likelihood of acquiring such information, the level
of authority rests with the Group Security Director.

4.23 [Part 14 - Authorising Officer's Statement. (CS&PI CoP 5.8 refers) I
If granting the application, the AO concerned is required to provide a clear statement to that
effect. The statement is likely to include a summary of;
4.23.1 The authorisation is under Section 28 (3b) RIPA 2000, namely for the purpose of preventing or
detecting crime or of preventing disorder.

4.23.2 Who the subject is, if known.

4.23.3 Why the proposed activity is necessary.

4.23.4 What activity and equipment may be involved? In cases involving the installation of covert
camera(s) the AO must include precise instructions as to the extent of the coverage of the
camera(s) and replicate this within Part 13 of the form. (See paragraphs 4.25 to 4.28 below).

4.23.5 Where the proposed surveillance is to take place.

4.23.6 When the proposed surveillance is to take place.

4.23.7 The objective of the operation.

© Royal Mail 2012 6:4 Directed Surveilance- RM V3.0~Page 10 of 17

POL00094132
POL00094132

4.23.8 Whether the proposed activity is proportionate.

4.23.9 What collateral intrusion may be involved and how this will be minimised. Where covert CCTV
is to be installed AO’s should give due consideration to the potential technical difficulties in
limiting the coverage to what is authorised. (Details pertaining to the installation of covert CCTV
need to be replicated in Part 13).

4,23.10The likelihood of acquiring confidential material.

4,.23,11What is authorised in respect of potential developments in the case (See paragraph 6.11
above). This is to include the activities authorised should new subjects, locations or tactics be
identified and any conditions imposed in the authorisation in respect of the development.

4,23.12A written authorisation will cease to have effect (unless renewed) at 23.59hrs at the end of a
period of three months, less one day, from when it took effect. For example, a written
authorisation granted on the 24" April will cease at 23:59 hours on the 23 July.

4.24 {Part 12 - Authorising Officer:

To be completed by the AO.

4.25 [Part 13 - Installation of Covert Cameras Authorising Officer]
In order to ensure that an installation engineer does not unwittingly install covert equipment that goes
beyond the extent of DS authority they must be fully briefed on the coverage of such equipment. The
installation engineer should be shown this part of the form only and be given precise instructions on
what has been authorised. Where available this may include sight of a floor plan/sketch of the area to
be covered.

4.26 The engineer is required to sign a declaration to the effect that they have installed the covert
camera(s) in accordance with the parameters of the authorisation.

4.27 [Part 14 - Investigator In Charge (IIC) DeclarationI
The IIC must provide all members of the operational surveillance team with a copy of the AO
statement prior to any surveillance and must sign the certificate to this effect. If new members join the
team after the briefing they must also be given a copy of the AO statement before they commence
surveillance and a note made by the IIC.

5. Reviews, Renewals and Cancellations

5.1 Reviews of Authorisations. Every authorisation to carry out DS must be regularly reviewed by an AO
who will assess the need for the Surveillance to continue. Reviews should be submitted if there have
been any significant changes;

5.1.1 In relation to the subject, method, equipment or scope of the surveillance.

5.1.2 Regarding the proportionality of the operation.

5.1.3 To the position in respect of collateral intrusion or acquisition of confidential information. Or;

5.1.4 At least every month or any shorter period stipulated by the AO. Such reviews must be
submitted to the AO 2 days prior to the designated review date, which will have been determined
at the time of authorisation.

5.2 Timely Reviews. If a DS authority has been granted which allows for development in the operation (see
paragraph 4.14 above) then a timely review will be necessary to advise the AO of specifics of the
development, any changes to the scope and methodology of the operation and any other changes in
accordance with paragraph 5.1 above.

5.3 General Reviews & Renewals. All review, renewal and/or cancellation requests must quote the original
authority number for the DS. It is also preferable to submit such requests to the AO who authorised
the DS in the first instance. Should changes in the authority be made by an AO as a result of a review
then these changes should be highlighted in the next renewal. All written reviews and renewals must
include the dates of all previous reviews or renewals. (See 7.3 below in relation to submission and
recording processes).

5.4 Renewal of Authority (CS&PI CoP 5.10 refers). As detailed at 4.23.12 above a written authorisation will
cease to have effect (unless renewed) at 23.59hrs at the end of a period of three months, less one day,
from when it took effect. The example in paragraph 4.23.12 above showed that a written authorisation
granted on the 24" April will cease at 23:59 hours on the 23™ July. If a renewal is authorised, this will
have taken effect at 23.59 hours on 23rd July. To request that an authority is renewed, a completed
form GSO95b must be received by the AO 6 days prior to the date on which the authorisation period
comes to an end.

5.5 Content of a Renewal (CS&PI CoP 5.15 refers). The questions at parts 3 to 6 of the Renewal Application
Form GSO95b incorporate specific requirements determined by the CoP. Authorisations may be
renewed more than once if necessary.

5.6 Authorising Officer (CS&PI CoP 5.13 refers). When considering the application for the DS to continue,
the AO must be satisfied that it is still necessary ‘for the purpose for which it was given’.

5.7. Reviews and Renewals of Authority to Conduct Directed Surveillance. If as a result of the submission of
a review or a renewal there is a change to the subject, method, equipment or scope of the surveillance
authority then all the Surveillance Operational Team members should be provided with a copy of the
relevant AO Statement. Part 8 - “The Investigator in Charge Declaration” should be completed on both
the GSO95a & GSO095b following a review or renewal of an application.

5.8 Cancellation of Authority (CS&PI CoP 5.17 & 5.18 refers). In circumstances whereby the DS no longer
meets the criteria upon which it was authorised, it must be cancelled (e.g. subject apprehended or no
longer has viable access to relevant property).

5.9 In order to protect the Human Rights of those who have been the subject of the surveillance, either
directly or indirectly, all surveillance activity must cease forthwith and a completed form GSO95c
submitted to the AO as soon as practicable. In part 3 of the GSO95c, it must be made clear what
material/evidence was acquired as a consequence of the surveillance and how it is proposed to deal
with it. This may be to use it in the criminal process, destroy it, store it, or to make it available for
another process such as conduct or a tribunal.

5.10 Product of Surveillance. When cancelling the surveillance authority the AO will provide instructions
regarding the handling and disposal of such material/evidence.

6. Confidentiality of Observation Points and Authority for 3" Party
Surveillance from or within Royal Mail Group Ltd Premises

6.1 Confidentiality of Observation Points, R vJohnson. R v Johnson is case law which deals with the
confidentiality of observation points (OP). As a result of “Johnson”, Judges can rule that officers do not

answer specific questions which may reveal the location of an OP, if it is thought that to do so could result

in reprisals against the occupants. Before a Judge can make such a ruling certain actions have to take

place. In a RMG Ltd led investigation these would be as follows;

6.1.1 An Investigation Team Manager (ITM) or above must be able to testify that they visited the OP
before it was used and spoke with the occupants. During the visit they established the occupant's
attitude to firstly what their premises were to be used for and secondly, the possible disclosure of
the location of the OP in Court, leading to their identity being revealed;
and

6.1.2 A Senior Investigation Manager (SIM) of BPC8 or above must be able to testify that, in the event
of a trial, immediately prior to it commencing, they will visit the OP to establish firstly, whether the
occupiers are the same as when the observations took place and secondly, whether they were or
were not, their attitude to the possible disclosure of the OP leading to their identity being
revealed.
If Investigators in RMG Ltd led investigations are intending to use OP, which may result in reprisals against
the occupants, then they should ensure that the “Johnson” actions are carried out. In Police or other RPA
cases the process is the same but instead of an ITM it should be an officer preferably a Sergeant or above
(or equivalent) and for a SIM a Chief Inspector or above (or equivalent).

Police Led Operations. On occasions the Police or other RPA wish to carry out DS using RMG Ltd premises
or other equipment. The management of the use of such premises or equipment is controlled by means
of the completion of the Authority for 3rd Parties to Conduct Surveillance Form GS096. The following
paragraphs aim to provide advice and guidance in general terms on the completion of the GS096.

[Part 4.-To be completed by an officer involved in the surveillance from the 3" party concerned]
This section is for completion by an officer in the 3rd party organisation involved. They are required to
certify that the DS is lawfully authorised and that they have read the guidance notes on the form.

[Part 2-To be completed by a Royal Mail Group Ltd Investigator}

The Investigator facilitating the application should ensure that any use of our premises or equipment is
in accordance with the legal requirements of RIPA and as such must see the part of the authority
(redacted if necessary) which deals with the use of our premises and equipment. Without sight of the
relevant part of the authority RMG Ltd could be susceptible for damages should the subject of the
surveillance claim violation of their Human Rights. If the 3" party refuses to disclose the relevant
information advice must be sought from an AO.

Investigators should certify that they have read, understood and considered the guidance notes detailed
on the form and then send a copy of the form to an AO in their line.

[Part 3 ~To be completed by a Royal Mail Group Lid Authorising Officer I

Any 3™ party application has to be authorised by a RMG Ltd AO. The AO must consider the Health and
Safety of all RMG Ltd employees, visitors and customers and whether R v Johnson should be invoked.
They should also consider if there are any other implications for the business.

The details on the GS096 should be recorded on the GS097, Record of Authorisations by the Authorising
Officer. The original GS096 should then be returned to the Investigator concerned.

A copy of the GS096 should be provided to the Prosecution Support Office (PSO) see 7.2 - 7.3 below.
The ‘3™ party’ concerned may be given the ‘original’ for their records and disclosure purposes.

Investigators must ensure that whilst on RMG Ltd premises the 3 party concerned fully complies with
our Health and Safety requirements.
