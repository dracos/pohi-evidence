Thanks Tom — 2 pm at OEC is fine.

I have asked my PA (DI Blanchard) to forward the dial in details for tonight.

Thanks

I have spoken to Rob at OEC. Subject to your OK, then logistics for today could run as follows:

WBONO0001778_0001
WBONO0001779
WBON0001779

- 2pm meeting at OEC with LGQC to be attended by you and me (others?). DCQC too (and I have said if
the Juniors need to attend to listen in as they are the ones that would then "do stuff’ then ok. If you
disagree please say). I have made the "new voices" point again and it is fully understood. Does 2pm at
OEC work for you ?

- LNQC is fine for a 5.15pm dial in. Could the necessary dial in details be sent to me and Rob & I will ensure
that LNQC (and DCQC, if he is not at FD in person (I have not (yet) requested that)) has them.

If the above is all OK then I'll see you at 2pm. The only action on POL is to get the dial in details for the 5.15pm over to
me.
