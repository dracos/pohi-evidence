Subject: SUBJECT TO PRIVILEGE - Postmaster litigation: GLO Application

To the Board:
Please note that the first Court hearing in relation to the Postmaster litigation is scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday 25
January 2017). This is a preliminary hearing to deal with procedural matters, namely, how the litigation will be

managed. A hearing on the substance of the claims is not expected before 2018.

We expect the Court to order that the dispute should be heard under a “Group Litigation Order” (“GLO”) and we agree
this is the best way for the litigation to proceed.

We expect the postmasters to brief the media that this outcome is a victory for them. The Comms team are, of course,
monitoring media activity, and we intend to respond positively to any enquiries - welcoming the Court’s decision as the
best opportunity for matters to be heard and resolved, but otherwise not offering any comment. Internal comms are
also ready to brief field and front line teams should there be any adverse publicity.

A verbal briefing on the outcome of tomorrow’s hearing and the way forward, will be provided at the Board on Tuesday.

Should you have any queries please contact either Mark Davies or myself.

Kind regards,

Jane
