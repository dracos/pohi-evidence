1.3 Partial Termination

(a) termination by Post Office of one or more Terminable Service(s) in
relation to Market Testing pursuant to Clause 47.10.1 (where paragraph

(b) termination by Post Office of one or more Terminable Service(s) for
convenience pursuant to Clause 47.10.2;

2.1

2.2

(c) automatic termination of Project HNG-X in accordance with Clause 47.15.

In any of the termination scenarios set out in paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 (but not in the case
of termination of Project HNG-X as referred to in paragraph 1.4) Post Office may seek to
obtain the delivery of Replacement Services under this Agreement or seek to continue
the Relevant Services after termination, in each case either by performing them itself or
by means of the Next Supplier.

The Parties acknowledge that it is their overall objective in relation to termination of the
Agreement, expiry of an Expiring Service and Partial Termination to procure, so far as is
reasonable and practicable, that there shall be an orderly transfer of responsibilities for
the delivery of the Relevant Services provided under this Agreement or an orderly and
efficient transition from the provision of the Relevant Services to the provision of
Replacement Services (as the case may be) to the Next Supplier and that any risk to or
adverse effect on the continuity and quality of the Services during such transfer shall be
minimised.

The purpose of this Schedule E is to:
1.7.1 set out certain principles governing Partial Termination;

1.7.2 set out the main steps to be followed on termination of this Agreement, Partial
Termination and/or termination of Project HNG-X;

1.7.3. set out the assistance that Fujitsu Services shall, and in the case of Paragraph
3,15 may, provide to Post Office and/or its Next Supplier with the intention of
helping them (if it is Post Office's chosen strategy to do so) put themselves in a
position to commence performance of Replacement Services promptly upon
expiry of this Agreement or as soon as reasonably practicable after completion of
any period of notice of termination given by Post Office to Fujitsu Services; and

1.7.4 set out the Parties’ obligations with respect to the development and maintenance
of the Exit Strategy and the Exit Plans.

Notwithstanding any provisions of this Schedule E to the contrary, if this Agreement is
terminated for Post Office Default under Clause 47.4, Fujitsu Services shall not be obliged
to develop or implement the General Exit Plan or the HNG-X Exit Plan.

PARTIAL TERMINATION

column headed “Date or Event from which termination can be effective.” in the table set
out in Annex 1 of this Schedule E.

Following service of a notice duly served under Clause 47.10.1 or 47.10.2, the Parties

in order to agree under the Change Control Procedure (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) any consequential changes to this Agreement
necessary to deliver the Services continuing after such Partial Termination including,
without limitation, the changes necessary to address:

2.2.1 the relevant indicative impacts listed in the table at Annex 1 to this Schedule E;

2.2.2 relevant dependencies and interfaces with other Operational Services identified
in the CCD (referred to in Schedule B3.1) that describes the Terminable Service
to be terminated;

2.2.3 the impact on Fujitsu Services’ ability to achieve any Service Level or other
obligations the achievement of which is linked to or dependent upon the
Terminable Service to be terminated;

2.2.4 any dependencies that Post Office shall fulfil or responsibilities that Post Office
shall perform in relation to the impacts referred to in paragraphs 2.2.1, 2.2.2 or
2.2.3;

2.2.5 _ the transfer pursuant to Clause 48 of ownership of any Project Assets from Fujitsu
Services to Post Office or the Next Supplier, the removal of such assets from the
Infrastructure and any consequent transfer of liability or risk in respect of such
Project Assets;

2.2.6 as contemplated by Clause 43.4, any qualifications and/or exceptions to Clause
43.1 necessary to reflect the transfer of risk and/or control in relation to system or
operational security from Fujitsu Services to Post Office or the Next Supplier
taking into account:

(a) any new security related responsibilities taken on by Post Office pursuant
to paragraph 2.2.4; and

(b) the level of security provided by the Replacement Interfaces; and

2.2.7 the matters referred to in paragraph 2.5.2, if Post Office shall have given a
direction pursuant to paragraph 2.5.

In the case of Partial Termination pursuant to Clause 47.10.1 (where paragraph
4.3.3(b)(ii) of Schedule D6 applies), the objective of paragraph 2.2 shall insofar as it
relates to this Agreement be to give effect to the supply by the winning tenderer to Post
Office of Replacement Services and documenting the technical and operational interfaces
between those Replacement Services and the continuing Services provided by Fujitsu
Services based on the specifications for such interfaces that formed part of the tender
process and were prepared with Fujitsu Services’ input and assistance pursuant to
paragraphs 6.4 to 6.6 (inclusive) of Schedule D6.

If and to the extent that the Parties fail to reach agreement under the Change Control
Procedure pursuant to paragraph 2.2 by the date the Terminable Service in question is
terminated:

the Parties shall each use all reasonable endeavours to reach agreement such
that all the matters referred to in paragraph 2.2 are addressed;

with effect from the date of such termination, Fujitsu Services shall perform the
obligations and achieve the Service Levels applicable in relation to all continuing
Services ("Continuing Obligations") to the extent it reasonably can do so, taking
into account those aspects of the performance of that Terminable Service upon
which Fujitsu Services’ performance of the Continuing Obligations depends; and

to the extent such failure to reach agreement is in relation to the qualifications or
exceptions to Clause 43.1 referred to in paragraph 2.2.6 or security related
responsibilities to be performed by Post Office, with effect from the date of such
termination Post Office shall be responsible for ensuring to the extent that it or a
Next Supplier:

(a) establishes the Replacement Interfaces, that the Replacement Interfaces
are secure; and/or

(b) operates or provides technical or service linkages to the Replacement
Interfaces, that such operation and linkages are performed in a secure
manner,

in each case in accordance with the levels of security and the standards of skill,
care and diligence that would be reasonably expected to be applied in relation to
the relevant Replacement Service taken on by a supplier of IT services using
good industry practice and adopting any enhanced security measures that such
a supplier could reasonably be expected to adopt if such supplier provided an
indemnity to Post Office in the same form as that set out in Clause 43.1 (but
subject to the same limitations or exclusions of liability set out in Clauses 43 and
44) in respect of the provision of that Replacement Service.

Any Disputes in relation to this paragraph 2.4 shall be resolved in accordance with the
Dispute Resolution Procedure.

25 In the case of Partial Termination pursuant to Clause 47.10.1 (where paragraph
4.3.3(b)(ii) of Schedule D6 applies) the Parties may agree or Post Office may direct that
Fujitsu Services as the provider of the Third Party Management Services shall be
responsible for the management of the provision by the winning tenderer of the
Replacement Services, in which case:

2.5.1

2.5.2

the Charges which shall be paid by Post Office to Fujitsu Services for the
provision of the Third Party Management Services in respect of such
Replacement Services shall be as set out in paragraph 9 of Schedule D1; and

any variations that may be required to the provisions in this Agreement relating to
the Third Party Management Services to give effect to such direction by Post
Office shall be agreed under the Change Control Procedure. In the absence of
such agreement the provisions of the CCD entitled "Third Party Management
Service: Service Description" (SVM/SDM/SD/0021) shall apply.

Schedule and update them to identify at a high level any additional
activities which the Parties agree are required in relation to termination of
this Agreement, Partial Termination and/or termination of Project HNG-X,
the detail of such activities to be included in the appropriate Exit Plan in
Phase Two.

3.2.3 The Exit Strategy shall:

(a)

set out a generic description of all probable post termination scenarios
relevant to this Agreement (each an “Exit Scenario”) including, without
limitation, the following:

(i) full or partial continuation of services substantially the same as
the Relevant Services by the Next Supplier;

(ii) full or partial provision of equivalent services by the Next Supplier
fully or partially utilising the Infrastructure;

(iii) full or partial provision of equivalent services by the Next Supplier
utilising an entirely new infrastructure; and

(iv) continued provision of the Services by Fujitsu Services following

shall thereafter jointly review and update the Asset Register and/or the Exit
Strategy once in every twelve months or if the Commercial Leads decide it is
necessary to do so as a result of significant changes to the Services. If the Asset

Register or the Exit Strategy is brought up to date following a change to the

remainder of the Term in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

Fujitsu Services shall provide an updated version of the Exit Strategy document

production of the updated versions of the Asset Register and Exit Strategy in
accordance with paragraphs 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 above.

Exit Plans for transition

Fujitsu Services shall, within 2 months of receipt of a request from Post Office,

which are dependent on the identity of the Next Supplier) for such Services as
Post Office may specify.

Fujitsu Services shall provide to Post Office part 2 of the Exit Plan (including
aspects of the Exit Plan which are dependent on the identity of the Next Supplier)
following notification to Fujitsu Services by Post Office as to who the Next
Supplier is and the nature of the transition process that Post Office and the Next
Provider requires. Fujitsu Services shall provide part 2 of the Exit Plan within 2
months of receipt of this notification from Post Office provided that, subject to
paragraph 3.4.3 below, such notification is received 2 months or longer after the
date the request for the part one of the Exit Plan was made in accordance with
paragraph 3.4.1 (i.e. the creation of part one of the Exit Plan and part two of the
Exit Plan shall not run concurrently). For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office
shall provide this information on or before the date it gives written notice of

Exit Plan (without requesting part 1) by notifying Fujitsu Services who the Next
Supplier is and the nature of the transition process that Post Office and the Next
Provider requires. In the event that Post Office requests part 2 of the Exit Plan

time of the Exit Scenarios.

mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and such bona fide potential Next
Supplier and/or Next Supplier, Fujitsu Services will:

4.1.1 Provide Post Office with reasonable information and assistance in relation to

(b) co-operate with bona fide potential Next Suppliers,

in order to enable Post Office to run a procurement process in compliance with
the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (in particular without limitation Regulation
4(3) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006) for all bona fide potential Next
Suppliers (which may include Fujitsu Services).

4.1.3. During any transition, implementation and operational phase by Next
Supplier(s), grant rights of access to relevant assets (including remote access
for IT related assets), premises, subcontractor contracts and third party
contracts.

For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent to which such information provision, support
and/or assistance in accordance with this paragraph 4.1 results in Fujitsu Services
incurring additional costs which it is able to evidence are over and above the Charges
and in particular without limitation are not a second charge for obligations already set out
in the Agreement (including but not limited to keeping documentation up to date) such
costs shall be recoverable from the Post Office.”

Post Office may at any time by notice to Fujitsu Services nominate the Person to be the
Next Supplier. Post Office shall procure that on each occasion it appoints a Next Supplier,
such Next Supplier shall enter into an Agreed Form NDA or any other form of non-
disclosure agreement mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and such Next
Supplier. Fujitsu Services shall not be liable for any breach of this Agreement to the extent
caused by the Next Supplier.

Where Post Office appoints or intends to appoint a Next Supplier, Post Office shall be
responsible for liaising with and ensuring the co-operation of such Next Supplier in all
planning and handover activities in respect of exit transition and where obligations in the
General Exit Plan which fall to Post Office are due to be performed by or with the co-
operation of the Next Supplier, such obligation will be deemed to include an obligation on
the Post Office to procure such performance or co-operation from the Next Supplier.

Where, following Partial Termination, Relevant Services are provided by a Next Supplier
and managed by Fujitsu Services pursuant to the Third Party Management Service, Post
Office shall procure that all information reasonably required by Fujitsu Services to perform
its obligations in respect of such Third Party Management Service is provided to Fujitsu

9.1 Impact of termination or expiry during transition

9.1.1. From 1st April 2015, it is anticipated that Post Office will initiate a number of
Partial Terminations of Services as it moves to its new procurement model. To
support the transition following these Partial Terminations there may be a
resulting change in the scope and charging for the central support Services
(Service Management Service, Management Information Service, and Security
Management Service). In addition, the Services may be impacted by the
termination or expiry of the Engineering Service, Operational Business Change
Service and CMT Service.

9.1.2 The impact of any Partial Termination on the remaining Services shall be
assessed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.2 of Schedule E.

9.1.3. The impact of any expiry of an Expiring Service shall be assessed in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.2 of Schedule E.

9.1.4 As part of any termination or expiry of any Services it is agreed that as part of
impacting the remaining Services the Parties shall review the applicability of the

9.2.1 Post Office shall be responsible for the provision of all spares stock for Expiring
Services (excluding POLSAP Applications Support Service, and Branch Network
Services) from 1st April 2015 until 23:59 on the 4" October 2016 at 23:59. From
5t October 2016 Post Office shall be responsible for the provision of all spares
stock for Expiring Services (excluding Branch Network Resilience Service and
Branch Network Services). For the avoidance of doubt, all spares stock
procured by or on behalf of Post Office shall form part of the Branch
Infrastructure.

9.2.2 Post Office may request in writing that Fujitsu Services source the spares stock
for Branch Infrastructure on Post Office's behalf (including spares stock identified
in a Mini Extension Report). In such circumstances and subject to the availability
of such spares, Fujitsu Services shall procure said spares at Post Office's cost.
Fujitsu Services shall also be entitled to charge for the storage of these spares.
In the event that Post Office extends the Engineering Service, Fujitsu Services
shall not be entitled to charge for those spares that it estimates it will require to
deliver the Services during the period for which the Engineering Service is
extended. Fujitsu Services will continue to be able to charge for the storage of
any other spares procured on behalf of Post Office during such period.

It is noted that at the time of entering into CCN 1400, both parties acknowledge that it is
not possible to predetermine all of the potential impact (including changes to the
relevant cost base) of the removal of the Service Desk Service and the impact of the
removal of other subsequent Terminable Services (whether before or after 31st March
2015) on the remaining Operational Services. To this end, the provisions of paragraph
2 (Partial Termination) of Schedule E (Termination and the Exit Plan) shall apply in
each instances and Fujitsu Services shall be required to impact each expiry and/or
termination and the Charges for the remaining services shall be varied according to any
increase or decrease in the remaining costs incurred by Fujitsu Services in delivery of
the remaining services. Any resultant reduction in Fujitsu Services’ costs shall be
deducted from the relevant Operational Charge but no additional deduction will be
made for the margin originally added to that cost. Any resultant increase in Fujitsu
Services' costs shall be added to the relevant Operational Charge but this additional
charge shall not form part of the calculation for any future Termination Charge.

MINI EXTENSIONS

In the event that Post Office requires any or all of the Expiring Services (excluding
Credence/MDM Service, the Salesforce Support Service, POLSAP Hosting Service and
POLSAP Applications Support Service) to continue beyond 31st March 2015, then the
following provisions shall apply:

10.1.1 Post Office shall only be able to extend a particular service for fixed 6 month
periods. In the event that Post Office requires an additional period beyond 30th
September 2015 then Post Office must also elect for an additional fixed 6 month
extension period.

10.1.2 In order to extend one of these Expiring Services (excluding POLSAP
Applications Support Services), Post Office shall give a minimum of 6 months’
written notice, i.e. in the first instance, such written notice must be received by
Fujitsu Services prior to 30th September 2014.

10.1.3 For the avoidance of doubt, liquidated damages (where applicable) shall continue
to apply during any mini extension in accordance with clause 18.

10.1.3A The Credence/MDM service, the Salesforce Support Service and POLSAP
Hosting Service are not extendable beyond 31% March 2015 in accordance with

Schedule E Version 15.0
Page 22 of 39

the terms above. The POLSAP Applications Support Service is not extendable
beyond 318 March 2016 in accordance with the terms above.

10.1.3B In the event that the Service Desk Service continues beyond 31st March 2015,

there shall be no reduction in contracted for Service Levels during the extended
period.

10.1.9

From 5'* October 2016 Fujitsu Services shall, acting as the informed supplier,
ensure that its personnel inform the Service Management Relationship (as
defined in Schedule A2) as soon as it is aware of any issues that may impact
on the provision of Expiring Services (be it by Fujitsu Services or the Next
Supplier) on a reactive basis. Where such issues are agreed they shall be
formally recorded in the minutes and become Refresh Items. If agreement is
not reached in the Service Management Relationship then the Parties shall
escalate the matter using the Dispute Resolution Procedure.

Additionally, to inform the mini extension request Post Office may elect to
commission via a CT, a report identifying any items of risk that would need to
be addressed in order for the relevant Service(s) to continue to operate during
any Mini Extension in accordance with the Agreement immediately prior to the
extension. This report shall be prepared on a pro-active basis with Fujitsu
Services consulting relevant sub-contractors as necessary. Such report shall be
delivered to Post Office within 3 months of the agreement date of the CT (the
“Mini Extension Report”). The report shall be delivered on a time and
materials basis but the cost of such report shall be capped at £30,000.

Post Office will review the Mini Extension Report and the Parties shall use
reasonable endeavours to agree any changes within 15 Working Days of the
date the Mini Extension Report is delivered to Post Office. If the Parties are
unable to agree the report then the matter shall be escalated via the existing
Dispute Resolution Procedure.

Once agreed, any items identified in the Mini Extension Report shall be deemed
to be Refresh Items.

If matters relating to potential Refresh Items have been referred to the Dispute
Resolution Procedure but not yet resolved and result in a service failure during
any mini extension period, then the potential Refresh Items attributable to the
service failure shall become Refresh Items.

Post Office may at its sole option determine whether to implement all, some, or
none of the Refresh Items set out in the Mini Extension Report and/or Service
Management Relationship minutes and/or Dispute Resolution Procedure
resolutions. For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office may purchase Refresh
Items from any Tower Contractor or any other third party but, as set out in
Schedule B1 (Branch Hardware Implementation) only Fujitsu Services may
implement such Refresh Items into the Services (at Post Office's additional
cost, where such costs are not recoverable under the Charges) to the extent it
still provides the applicable Service. In the event that Post Office decides to
proceed with some or none of the Refresh Items then Fujitsu Services shall not
be liable for any service failure directly attributable to Post Office not
proceeding with and/or making available the Refresh Items. In the event that
Post Office decides to proceed with some or all of the Refresh Items then, for
the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services' obligations to provide the Services in
accordance with the Service Levels shall be unaffected to the extent to which
Post Office procures and/or provides the Refresh Items within the agreed
timescales.

10.1.10 Furthermore, if Post Office does not elect to procure the Mini Extension Report

and to the extent that Fujitsu Services has fulfilled its obligations under

paragraph 10.1.4 of this Schedule E, then, should the service be impacted by
the non-availability, refresh or support of hardware and software, or of spares
after 31st March 2015 an appropriate adjustment to service level performance

shall be made in relation to failures directly caused by the lack of availability,
refresh or support of those spares, hardware or software.

SPARES STOCK

Prior to the termination/expiry of any of the Services, Fujitsu Services will notify Post
Office promptly after it becomes aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware), of
any:

10A.2.1_ software or hardware used in the performance of the Services; or
10A.2.2 spares stocks for Branch Infrastructure,

which is becoming end-of-life and/or coming out of support in the two years after the
planned expiry of the Service.

From 5' October 2016, Post Office shall be responsible for the provision of all spares
stock from 1* April 2015 required for the provision of Expiring Services. For the
avoidance of doubt, Post Office may request that Fujitsu Services source the spares
stock on Post Office's behalf. In such circumstances and subject to the availability of
such spares, Fujitsu Services shall procure said spares at Post Office's cost. Fujitsu
Services shall also be entitled to charge for the storage of these spares.

In the event that Post Office extends the Engineering Service, Fujitsu Services shall not
be entitled to charge for those spares that it estimates it will require to deliver the
Services during the period for which the Engineering Service is extended. Fujitsu
Services will continue to be able to charge for the storage of any other spares procured
on behalf of Post Office during such period where such spares are stored by Fujitsu
Services.

RAMP DOWN CHARGES

Once a particular Operational Service, Counter Positions or Branches is/are supported
by a Next Supplier or any other supplier (and not Fujitsu) it/they shall cease to be
“Counter Positions” or “Branches” for such Operational Service.

For the avoidance of doubt, a single Branch or Counter Position may be supported by
Fujitsu in relation to one Operational Service but may be supported by a Next Supplier
in relation to another Operational Service. As illustrated in the example in paragraph
1.9 of Schedule D1, that Branch or Counter Position supported by Fujitsu would be
included in the variable charge calculation for the Operational Service but not the
Branch or Counter Position supported by the Next Supplier.

Both Parties acknowledge that Post Office may request further extensions to the
Expiring Services. Both Parties agree to act reasonably in the event of any such
request and any associated negotiation of terms. In particular, Fujitsu Services agrees
to mitigate its costs of supply and stranded costs with respect to any further extension of
the Expiring Services to the extent that it is reasonably possible to do so having regard
to, amongst other things, the timing of any request relative to the expiry date of the
Expiring Services
