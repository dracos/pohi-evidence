REVISED
OPENING NOTE

This Opening Note is supplied for assistance of the Court and the defence. It is not to be
regarded as a pleading or as limiting the way in which the Crown's case in put. All available
evidence will be relied upon.

OUTLINE SUMMARY

1. Carl Adrian PAGE was the Sub Postmaster at Rugeley Post Office in
Staffordshire. PAGE is charged with theft from Post Office Limiled
between March 2002 and January 2003 of the sum of £ 282,000, that
being the deficiency found when the office was the subject of an audit on
14" January 2003. On that day he computer records suggested that there
should have been £282,000 worth of foreign currency in PAGE's safe.
There was none and that money was nowhere to be found. This hole in
the accounts was the result of inflated figures put into the system by Page.

Page deliberately put false, inflated figures into the computer records in

order to pretend that money which he stole over a long period of time was
still there. The precise length of time PAGE was stealing can never be
known. For all we know the stealing could have begun at any stage after

PAGE took over the Rugeley office in February 1997.

. The Crown's case is based on inference. No sack of money containing

£282,000 has been found, nor can the sum be found in a bank account.
No extravagant living can be identified. But you wouldn't expect to find
features like this if Page was stealing over a protracted period and if he
had the sense to cover his tracks. The allegation simply depends on the
figures put into the system by Page. You will have to consider whether
there might be an innocent explanation for these figures that week after
week were so wrong. The Crown suggests that there is a clear pattern to
the figures which shows that they cannot be the product of a series of
mistakes or some glitch in the system. The pattern is such that they can

only have been entered deliberately.

. I don’t think there will be any dispute that it was PAGE himself who

manually entered the incorrect figures into the computer system. If he did
this deliberately there can only be one explanation — to hide the money he

was pilfering.

BACKGROUND

4. This case is a retrial. In the Summer of 2005, just before the Ashes began,

Page stood trial in relation to this allegation and also an allegation of

conspiracy to defraud. On the conspiracy count he had a co-defendant,

I The conspiracy allegation related to a large amount of

foreign currency transactions between! and Page. It is very
important to note that both Defendants were found not guilty in relation to
the conspiracy allegation. No verdict was returned on the theft allegation.
That is why you are here - to try the theft matter and that matter alone.
You will hear a lot about the evidence relating to the foreign currency

transactions but only by way of important background information. The

defendants were found not guilty and those verdicts must be respected.

5. You will hear evidence about th ansactions not because I
want to suggest that the previous jury got it wrong, but simply so that you
can put the theft allegation in its proper context. The transactions are
relevant for two reasons. Firstly the audit in which the missing £282,000
came to light took place as part of the investigation into the currency
transactions. Secondly, the explanation PAGE gave in interview when he
was asked to explain the “hole” of £282,000 was inextricably linked to his

dealings with That explanation was a lie but you will only

be able to see why it was a lie if you hear evidence about the!

transactions. Although you will hear a lot about

case there is no suggestion that he was in any way involved in the offence

you are to try.

7. Bureau de Change facilities are available on demand at a large number of
Post Offices. Rugeley was one of them. Many of you may have seen a

Bureau de Change at your local Post Office.

8. Staff at "on demand" Bureaux de Change order currency from the Cash
Handling Centre at Hemel Hempstead, which then dispatches the funds
by priority mail. On receipt at an office outlet, the volume and exchange

rate for the currency is booked in.

9. The operation of POL Bureaux de Change is governed by an
Operations Manual.' The Manual in force during most of the Indictment
period was that dated January 1998, at JB 123-186. [Procedures

remained much the same in a later edition @ JB 5-121].

10. The Manual indicates how the receipt of currency at each office, and its

sale is dealt with:

11.Each Bureau is equipped with a Forde Moneychanger which performs
currency conversions and has an accounting function: see para 4.3 @ JB

127.

12.The amounts and values of currency received from Hemel Hempstead
should be entered into the Forde Moneychanger, along with the buy note

rates [JB 145].

POL00066717

R. v. Carl Adrian PAGE 5 2" October 2005
Opening Note: Re-Trial

13.Sales of currency are also entered on the Forde Moneychanger, which
prints a receipt for the customer and records the same information on a

continuous till roll.

14.At the time with which we are concerned currency transactions had to be
entered manually onto the office's Horizon computer system for
accounting purposes. The Forde Moneychanger was a stand alone

machine and was not connected to Horizon.

15.In dealing with foreign exchange transactions, the rate of exchange for
any particular currency of course varies with the money markets.
Therefore, a rate which is to be applied uniformly across the country in
Post Offices which have Bureaux de Change facilities has to be set for
each currency each day. That rate is set by First Rate Travel [“First
Rate”], which operated the Bureau de Change facilities in partnership with

POL, and is sent in the form of a faxed table to the offices on a daily basis.

16. The rates set out in that table were those which staff were obliged to use
when selling foreign currency over the counter for all amounts up to £
5,000. However, sometimes a customer might want to buy more than £
5,000 worth of foreign currency. Understandably, he would expect a
preferential rate, and the system catered for this. A telephone call could be

made to First Rate to request the preferential rate for the particular day.

called RPX Recycled Plastics. Over a substantial period, and certainly

favourable to him.

. made a profit by changing the Euros back into sterling at

other Bureaux de Change: this was part of the way he made money as a
businessman. In brief summary, the evidence establishes that, during the
period covered by the Indictment, he bought through PAGE's office over

11 million Euros.
49. INITIAL INVESTIGATION

20.In December 2002, H M Customs & Excise made inquiries with the Money
Laundering section within POL because of concerns over the large volume
of foreign currency exchanges from sterling into Euros being transacted at

Rugeley.

21.A surveillance operation was mounted on 13” January 2003. He was kept
under observation while he was at the office, and then followed when he
was driven away. As he was about to enter a Bureau de Change near
the Holiday Hypermarket, Birmingham, he was arrested. He had a holdall
which contained 582,000 Euros in cash and a receipt from Rugeley PO

dated that day.

22.As a matter of history, was interviewed by Customs, and
their investigation concluded with his being released when they were

satisfied that he was not involved in money laundering. He was simply a

amounts of sterling into Euros.

23.Manish PATEL, Investigation Team Manager for POL, had been aware of

the Customs’ inquiry. When told by them of! GRO

rrest, he

decided that PAGE should be located and that a search of the office
undertaken. The search took place that evening, conducted by police
officers under the supervision of Patel and his colleague Mandy Bushell.
The Bureau till was found to contain five cheques each drawn on

mpany (JB 247-250). Four of the five cheques (JB

247-8) were dated the same day and matched the value on the receipt
(i.e. £ 360,493.83). During the course of the search Patel was informed
that PAGE had contacted the Police and was going to attend the Police

Station that evening.
AUDIT OF THE OFFICE

24. Royal Mail Group auditors led by BURROWS attended the office on 14"
January. A "snapshot" printout (JB 280) of the stock held by PAGE, the
"AM" stock showed that his stock should have held £ 72,159.03 in cash, £
282,000 worth of foreign currency and a smaller amount in instant game
cards. There was no foreign currency in the AM stock. That amount is
the subject of the charge. Page was pretending that there was £282,000
worth of foreign currency in his safe because that figure was the total he
had stolen over a long period of time. At the time of the audit this was not

clear because of the confusing presence of the cheque at JB 249. The
POL00066717

auditors assumed that this represented a foreign currency transaction and

included the cheque in the audit with the result that the £282,000 shortfall

almost disappeared.

FIRST INTERVIEWS OF PAGE

25.PAGE had been interviewed briefly by the Police, without the assistance
of Patel, when he attended the Police Station on the night of 13/1/03. That

interview was a fairly general one about PAGE's dealings with

and did not touch on the issues with which you are
concerned. PAGE was interviewed by Patel in greater detail on 14/1,

following the audit. That interview again largely focussed on PAGE’s

dealings with _} However he was asked questions about the

given him this cheque because three cheques he had given him just
before Xmas were likely to bounce. About this PAGE appears to have

been telling the truth. See the 3 cheques at JB 982-3. Rather surprisingly

and, as we will see, untruthfully, PAGE went on to say that he had given

jore euros to the value of the new cheque, effectively as

SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION

26.The POL Investigation Team Manager Manish PATEL received a large
amount of documentation from which he prepared a range of Schedules in

the course of his investigation. A selection only is relevant for this trial.
DB - 0806

POL00066717

PAGE - 043

R. v. Carl Adrian PAGE 9 2" October 2005
Opening Note: Re-Trial

27.A main Schedule MP/3 (JB 986-9) lists the vast majority of the

transactions from 9" March 2002 until 13" January 2003.

The contents are mainly taken from the Forde Moneychanger till rolls. A
handful of transactions are missing because the till rolls no longer exist.
The timings for transactions after the clocks went back in Autumn 2002
are 1 hour ahead of when they actually took place because the internal

clock within the Moneychanger was not altered. Excluding the abortive

transaction on 13" January 2003,, 3RO effected 110 transactions,
buying 11,172,450 Euros, for which he paid £ 6,725,339.50. This was an

underpayment of £592,802.74.

28.A further Schedule MP/80 [JB 1420-1425] details the sale transactions

from 16" January 2002 to 7" January 2003 conducted b:

those acting on his behalf. This shows that over that period he sold
14,042,405 Euros (mainly to Thomas Cook outlets in and around

Birmingham), realising a sterling amount of £ 8,598,889.69.

29. Patel now also had the opportunity to consider what PAGE had said about
the £278,181.82 and what ramifications this had for the missing £282,000
shown on the snapshot for the AM stock. Until Page had said that the

cheque was a replacement for 3 cheques thi had said

were going to bounce it had naturally been assumed that the cheque
represented a completed foreign currency transaction. After all why else
would a cheque be in the Bureau till? The auditors took it into account on

14/1 and so the office did not appear to be running at an enormous loss.

R. v. Carl Adrian PAGE 10 2" October 2005
Opening Note: Re-Trial

The £278,181.82 cheque had almost entirely covered the missing
£282,000. After Patel had heard Page's account he realised that the
£278,181.82 should not have been considered at all by the auditors. There

really was an unidentified loss £282,000.

30. Patel decided to examine the weeks before the audit to see if this was a
blip or part of a pattern. It is important to remember that what the Forde
Moneychanger says on its till rolls about the amount of foreign currency in
the Office should match the figures on Horizon. But at the time we are
talking about the figures on Horizon had to be manually inserted. The
figures would not match if the person keying in the information put in false
information. Patel’s findings are set out in the schedule at JB 1128ff. This
schedule is the essence of the case. In summary, from Cash Accounting
Period ["CAP"] 22 (w/e 28.08.02.) through to CAP 41 (w/e 08.01.03.), the
internal documentation showed.a steady inflation each week commencing
with an inflated figure of £ 188,000 and by the date of the audit reaching
£282,000, the precise amount shown as foreign currency in PAGE's "AM"

stock.

FURTHER INTERVIEW OF PAGE

31.After Patel had performed these investigations PAGE was further
interviewed on 23 April. The interviews were long and again largely dealt
with the [GRO itransactions. Patel did however also ask some
ions about the £282,000 shortfall. PAGE again explained that
ad given him the £278,181.82 cheque to cover the 3
cheques which were likely to bounce. Page had given him extra euros to

the value of that cheque. He then suggested that these extra euros
matched the £282,000 figure in the snapshot. They were no longer there

because he had given them to This was a neat but

completely untrue explanation for the shortfall.

32.Why was it untrue? Firstly it is an affront to common sense.

GRO, has just said that 2 very high value cheques are going to

bounce. Why on earth would PAGE want to give him an enormous

unsecured loan? Even if one gives due allowance to the fact that PAGE

had an established business relationship with :

} it is

inconceivable that he would allow this cheque to have such a dual

purpose. Second Ireceived the euros he failed for the

first time to change them into sterling. There is no record of him
exchanging that amount. There is further no record of the transaction
being put through the Forde Moneychanger. The Moneychanger not only
acts as the record of the transactions, but it carries out the calculation
according to the rate at which it is set, and is therefore the obvious means

by which PAGE would calculate how many Euros to give to

Finally there is no record either of this extra amount of
euros being ordered from Hemel Hempstead or of its being booked into
the Forde Moneychanger on its arrival. Compare Schedule MP/82 [JB
1470-1471] with LGH/04 [JB 199] which shows the amounts going out to
Rugeley. The respective figures for January all match, which suggests that
all the money sent out to Rugeley was properly entered into the Forde

Moneychanger on arrival.

33. In a nutshell this extra sum of euros never left a trace. This was because it

was a figment of PAGE’s imagination.

34. Page gave this explanation in two separate interviews, months apart. In
the first interview this false extra sum of euros must have been fresh in his

mind. This was no slip of memory. It was a deliberate lie.
ANALYSIS OF THE THEFT

35.The Crown's case is that the theft was of cash in sterling which had been
stolen over a period of time by PAGE. He covered it up by routinely
inflating the Horizon computer records in relation to foreign currency held
in his own safe, the “AM” stock.” It is the round figure of the inflations that
particularly suggest PAGE was stealing sterling. You would expect round
figures for the foreign currency itself, not its sterling equivalent. He no
doubt kept a tally of the cash he stole and then to fill the gaping hole in the
accounts he simply pretended that was an extra amount of foreign
currency equal in value to the round figure of sterling he had stolen. He
was able to do this because the Forde Moneychanger stood alone. The

figures had to be entered into Horizon manually.

36.It so happens that the inflated figures were being keyed in as if they
represented foreign currency but the Crown's case is that this was simply
a convenient location within the accounting system in which to conceal

what was going on.

37.How did he discover this trick? Two important events in June and July

2002 provide a clue.

38. There had been concerns about PAGE's management of the office before
this inquiry. On 27" June 2002, an audit had taken place at the office, at a
time when it was discovered that PAGE had gone on holiday. The
auditors found a confusing mess. Eventually after speaking to Page on the
phone it was possible to balance the office with an overall shortage of
£8,335.63. Susequent enquiries have shown that the real shortage on that
day was £138,149.29 The auditors made a similar mistake as they did on
14/1/03. They included inthe accounting process cheques they found at
the office which had not yet been put through the system. The vast
majority of the true shortage consisted of money that PAGE had

previously stolen.

39.1n July 2002, a manager in Bristol, Douglas BROWN, was reviewing the
offices which appeared to be holding excessive amounts of cash overnight
[known as Overnight Cash Holdings or “ONCH"]. On 25" July 2002, it
transpired that the figures were much higher than the "target" figure for
ONCH. PAGE was asked to return £ 250,000 to the cash centre the
following day, and the Retail Line Manager ["RLM"] CARTWRIGHT was
informed. A cash in transit ["CIT"] secure vehicle attended the next
morning, but PAGE was not present and the staff knew nothing about the

collection. CARTWRIGHT attended the office, found a considerable

amount of cash and arranged to have £ 160,000 collected that afternoon.

This was being collected by CIT when PAGE arrived at the office.

40. The initial contact that Cash Management had with the Rugeley office was
a telephone call between Brown and PAGE. PAGE was asked to provide
his actual cash holdings for three cash account weeks. ONCH do not
include foreign currency. If PAGE did not realise this before, he would
have realised it when he provided the figures. It is a reasonable inference
that he learned from his experience in July 2002 what might lead to him

being investigated, and what he might be able to hide.

ae

. Look again at MP/6 at JB 1129. It was during week 18 that £ 160,000 was
temitted out of the office. There remained at the end of that accounting
period a very large amount of foreign currency declared as being “on
hand”: £ 191,095.97 and the Crown say inflation in the accounts of £
177,500. From the end of August 2002 [EXX 1129] until the date of the
audit in January 2003 [EXX 1130], virtually every week shows a continuing
increase in the inflation, with the figures increasing generally by exact
numbers of thousands of pounds each week until the £ 282,000 figure is
reached. This is a pattern that cannot possibly have been created by
accident. Nor can it be the result of a mystery technical glitch. The
inflations come from figures manually inserted by PAGE. Week after week

he has to fill the hole he has created by his dishonesty.
