Subject: CWU and alleged Horizon error

Dear all

To update regarding developments today about the allegations (originating from CWU) about the ‘discovery’ of a
Horizon error duplicating transactions, as claimed in last week’s Computer Weekly report:

1. Computer Weekly is following up this story and attempting, I think, to write a story that ‘confirms POL is
investigating a suspected error’ or similar. We are playing a straight bat with our established lines and not
getting into the detail of the CWU claims.

2. Tim McCormack has today written a blog (attached). This is full of very misleading and confused information
about the issue but it is concerning that he is apparently being given internal documents (which might not use
the most helpful language). We are getting hold of the ATOS email he alleges was sent to the CWU.

3. My understanding of the issue is that it a conformance not technical issue (albeit there is a technical fix that
will be put in place by FJ by March 2016). It is not widespread, the issue is apparent when it occurs, is
transparent in logs and also is identified through back office reconciliation. It is easily corrected and in the
case that Mr McCormack refers to I understand that the correction is via a Transaction Correction.

4. Rod has copies of all the coverage to date on this (Computer Weekly, Shropshire Star and Tim McCormack’s
blog) to send to CK for disclosure considerations.

5. Mark Underwood and I are meeting Pete Newsome from FJ tomorrow to go into some more detail about
root causes so that we can develop stronger rebuttals as needed, if this starts to get any traction. But my view
is that we should stay as high level as possible with our lines to avoid providing any more angles.

Please let me know if you need any further info — will keep everyone updated.
