Alwen, Susan,

Please find attached the latest draft of the Briefing Note.

I have incorporated Mark Davies’ comments this evening, and am awaiting comments from Simon Baker.
I will look to incorporate all comments and circulate a further draft as soon possible tomorrow morning.
Please let me know if you need anything in the meantime.

Kind regards, Rodric
