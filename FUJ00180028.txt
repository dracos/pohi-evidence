Subject: Subpostmaster Solicitors Potential Contact

Post Office Limited are currently involved in a class action brought by
a group of current and former subpostmasters which is due in court in
November 2018 and March 2019. During this period, it is possible
that Freeths solicitors, who are representing the subpostmaster
group, may attempt to contact Fujitsu staff. If you receive such
contact please do not respond, but instead pass the details of the
contact to Pete Newsome or Chris Jay.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
