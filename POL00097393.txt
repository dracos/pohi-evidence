You may recall that last August I wrote to you on behalf of my
constituent, Mrs Pauline Thomson of \
i GRO i who wished you to refer her case
against the Post Office to 2" Sight. In response, a member of your staff
kindly provided me with further details which I passed to my constituent.

Mrs Thomson has now stated that she is happy for 2"? Sight to proceed
with an investigation of her case and she has confirmed that she
understands her details will be seen by the Post Office. In addition, she
has notified me that she was Postmistress of Matfield Post Office between
September 2003 and September 2008.

Please do not hesitate to let me know if you require any further details.

Yoursr coat

I Greg Clark!
