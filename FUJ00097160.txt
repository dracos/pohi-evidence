AG3.60

Decision

Acceptance position.

DC confirmed that there are no outstanding
High Severity Acceptance Incidents, and that all
other thresholds are within tolerance for
Acceptance Gateway 3.

Discussion ensued over the relevance to formal
acceptance of the outstanding assurances for
Service Delivery. It was agreed that these are
more relevant to the ongoing release
authorisation decisions, and therefore do not
preclude passing through AG3.

High Severity Al if not delivered in time for the
High Volume Pilot (over 272 branches).

As such, “Qualified Acceptance” at AG3 was
agreed, subject to the successful delivery of the
high priority items in Reset 04 (see
AG3.61below for assessment of “high priority”
items).

Whilst not an exact match, this is closest to
Acceptance Board Recommendation 3:
“Proceed at risk through Acceptance
Gateway’.

AG3.61 AD Non-High priority items in Reset 04. Closed
MB offered an option to remove items
from Reset 04 which are not regarded as
High priority — if they are at risk of
missing the High Volume Pilot deadline,
or affecting the delivery of items which
are High priority. AD will consider if any
items are at risk, and liaise with Post
Office to discuss their possible removal
(at the final discretion of Post Office Ltd).
New Actions and points to note from meeting of 29.06.2010

AG4.01 Dc Update the AG4 Acceptance Report to Open 06/07
reflect the most current position — as
detailed in the Slide Pack presented to
the Board.

AG4.02 PN Liaise with Gary Blackburn to ensure the I Open
delayed test concerning Incident
Management process assessment
during DR / failover testing is completed
before AG6. This can be undertaken
during the Annual DR test.

Decision N/A The Board agreed that: N/A
“Approval is given to proceed through
AG4. This approval is given without
prejudice to any claims for loss or
damages arising out of the delays to the
date of planned completion of end May
2010 up to the date hereof and in
respect of any additional delay arising
out of the default of Fujitsu”
