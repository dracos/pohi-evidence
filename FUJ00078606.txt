Model Office Testing Progress Report Final Pass

Progress Report for Model Office Testing - Day 10
Friday 26" February 1999

Management Summary

¢ Outlet Temporary Closure successfully applied.
¢ Some issues raised surrounding BES Helpdesk activity
e All testing activity complete to schedule

Overall status of MOT testing: GREEN
The management summary status indicators are defined as follows;

Green —_ No major issues which require escalation outside of the testing arena
Amber _ Testing have serious concerns over quality
Red Major system difficulties have prevented progress

Planned ‘Key’ Counter Activity

¢ Business as usual transactions all outlets.
¢ Temporary Office closure at Celtic to simulate an office robbery.

Actual ‘Key’ Counter Activity

¢ Some difficulties were experienced when applying the temporary closure
of Celtic.
e¢ The HSHD required interaction and authorisation from various
regional departments. Due to test environment constraints, we had
to forego this area of the end-to-end process.
¢ BES payments were successfully redirected to an alternative PO.
¢ The ‘Final’ Cash Account produced at Celtic following the
simulated robbery balanced.
¢ A number of icon or product related issues were identified that were
ultimately attributed to the provision of non-core reference data.
Corrective action (in the form of a work package) will be applied over the
weekend.
e Some further BES issues;
e¢ We were unable to perform a Helpdesk encashment when the
automated outlet had undergone a powerfail scenario. ‘No
Payments due’ were reported when payments were expected.
« Another unaccountable ‘No Payments Available’ messages was
received. Investigation is underway.
¢ Late delivery of PUN’s and Cards resulted in the majority of tests
being completed via manual detail entry.
