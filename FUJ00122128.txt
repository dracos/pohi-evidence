Hi, Gareth,
As per our discussion.
PSA copy of our current WS. Penny Thomas has marked up some areas that need attention for us to be able to provide
further WS to the PO. It has only come to our notice that quite a few things have changed eg OBCS, TMS since June 05
and we would like the WS to reflect these.
Please could you look at this when you've got some time and let me know when it's convenient for you to discuss.

Kind regards,

Neneh

Neneh,

I've updated the Witness Statement as discussed.

I'm left some of the Networking bit highlighted in Blue, since I can't say that I know it is true (but it probably is). It
may be OK just to delete that bit. What is left in that section may be sufficient (I guess it depends upon what the

issue is!) I've removed the blue highlighting from the rest of the document.

I've used "Revisions" so that you can see what I've changed. I've highlighted the Date etc in yellow to remind us
to update it for the final version.

Happy to discuss further.

Regards

Gareth
