INCEDENT REPORT

Cash Account Week 10 (27/05/04 — 02/06/04).
NBSC REF; H13312265.

Please note it has been brought to the attention of the Sub-Postmaster at Ibstock PO
(2232170) via Chesterfield that an error has occurred in Giro bank withdrawals.

It is alleged that £48.96 has been entered twice in the same cash account period.
Investigations todate have proven that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that
this was not as a result of counter staff error but that of the Horizon system.

On Friday 28” May 04 at 16:50 hrs Giro Withdrawals were cut off and at 16:58 hrs a
Giro Withdrawal for £48.96 was transacted. Therefore the Giro Withdrawal for £48.96
should appear on the next days Giro Withdrawal slip dated Saturday 29" May 04,
however it did not. Having cut off late due to the bank holiday rush at 13.05 hrs on
Saturday 29” May 04 and then realized the stip for £48.96 was still in the cashiers draw
Mrs. Rudkin OIC for the office entered the £48.96 Giro Withdrawal to the Horizon
system at 13:10 hrs having checked the day before Giro Withdrawal report. The report
for Giro Withdrawals for Tuesday 1* June 04 shows clearly the first transaction on the
report is for £48.96.

Some how this particular transaction has managed to electronically shroud its self from
the reports but has still managed to report its self to the final cash account. Hence
Chesterfield noticing the difference in the total figures in Giro Withdrawals for the week.
