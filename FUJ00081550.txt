Receipts and Payments Mismatch

Introduction

The purpose of this note is to document a request that we have had from Post Office in terms
of presenting details of what happened as a result of a bug in HNG-X in September 2010
which caused a Receipts and Payments mismatch and also resulted in Discrepancies being
lost.

The background to this is the fact that there was a BBC documentary broadcast on Monday 7"
February 2011 reporting on postmasters being unhappy about being pursued for losses by
Postmasters on Horizon.

It should be noted that the issues described here relates to HNG-X (Horizon Online) and that
the implementation of the accounting mechanisms in the two systems is totally different (but
they do produce the same reports and support the same business process).

This version of the note reflects my current understanding of Post Office Ltd’s requirements.

The Original Problem

This is extracted from a note produced at the time and shared with Post Office Ltd
called ‘Correcting Accounts for “lost” Discrepancies’ in document Lost
Discrepancies.doc.

PC0204263 describes a problem with SU Balancing that will result in a Receipts and
Payments mismatch. A fix was created for this Peak.

The fix has subsequently been fully deployed.

However any branch encountering the problem will have corrupted accounts and Peak
PC0204765 is a Master Peak to record all affected branches and also to define the process for
correcting the accounts.

It should be noted that PC0204263 was raised as a result of Fujitsu’s monitoring of system
events and not as a result of a customer call from NBSC or HSD (although there were
subsequent calls from Branches). This shows that the system monitoring controls for
Receipts and Payments mismatches were in place and were effective in detecting such
problems.

The problem occurs as part of the process of moving Discrepancies into Local Suspense.

When Discrepancies are found when rolling a SU over into a new TP, then the User is asked
if they should be moved to Local Suspense (MSG31316). Should they Cancel at this point
the Discrepancy is zeroised in the Local Cache (but nothing is written to the BRDB). Note
that there is no corresponding Balancing Transaction generated in the Local Cache and so the
Local Cache is in an Unbalanced state.

If at the next screen (where the options are to: print or preview the trial balance again; to re-
attempt the rollover; or to cancel the rollover) the rollover is Cancelled, then no harm is done.
However if the Rollover is re-attempted at this point, the rollover will continue with the
corrupted Local Cache.

In practice this re-attempted rollover has usually been to a new BP, but it is the
reattempted rollover that results in the corruption.

This has the following consequences:

= There will be a Receipts and Payment mismatch corresponding to the value of
Discrepancies that were “lost”

Note that if the User doesn’t check their Final Balance Report carefully they may be
unaware of the issue since there is no explicit message when a Receipts and Payment
mismatch is found on the Final balance (the User is only prompted when one is detected
during a Trial balance)

= The Local Suspense will have no knowledge of this specific Discrepancy

= The Opening Figures for Discrepancies in the new Period will be zero rather than the
actual value of the Discrepancy

= The data used for the BTS will also have a zero value for Discrepancies at the end of the
period. When the BTS is produced this will result in a similar Receipts and Payment
mismatch

Note that if the bug was not present, then the Discrepancy would have been transferred to
Local Suspense and that would have been cleared, so there are a number of things wrong
with the BTS. However the impact of the bug is that the Discrepancy is lost and so the
simplest way to correct it is to re-introduce the lost Discrepancy in a subsequent period
and allow the normal rollover process to correct it

Note that if more than one SU has the issue then the value will be the total value of all
errors.

= The level of Discrepancies when viewed at the Branch will no longer match the level as
seen in POL SAP or POL MIS

The problem appears to have affected 62 Branches and details have been provided to Post
Office Ltd of all the BTS and SU Rollover Reports for these Branches until they were clear of
the issue.

3. What Post Office want now

Post Office are now looking to put together a “storyboard” showing the precise steps all the
way through the problem, consisting of screen shots and snapshot reports from the system.
This will assist in explaining the issue to senior management and, if necessary, the Press.

Post Office are seeking help from Fujitsu in doing this.

Fujitsu propose offer to do the following to meet that requirement:

4,

1. Select one of the affected Branches

POL should be able to select a branch from the information they have. POL have
responded that Fujitsu should select any of the 62 affected branches.

2. For this Branch, we need to describe exactly what happened in terms of screens that
were displayed and reports that were actually produced. The reports that were
produced are already available in the information we have provided to Post Office
Ltd. We should be able to put together screenshots from a test or development
system.

3. In addition, we can identify at key points in the sequence what the state of the
Branch’s accounts actually were, by mocking up what a SU Balance Snapshot would
have looked like at that point of time. This can be done by taking the version of the
report we have provided to POL and editing it to reflect the changed figures at that
point in time.

4. This information can then be presented to POL either as a document or a PowerPoint
slide show.

POL need to let us know which they want. POL have chosen 2, 3 and 4 to be
presented in a document format followed with a walkthrough. The information is
presented in section 4 below and a walkthrough will be arranged accordingly.

Detailed Scenario

Branch 135026 has been chosen to illustrate the problem. This Branch has two Stock Units,
AA and ATM. The issue occurred during TP 09 when rolling over Stock Unit ATM from BP
01 to BP 02 on 23" September 2010.

Stock Unit ATM is an Individual Stock Unit.

A variance between the daily cash declarations and the system figures of £88.77 had first been
identified on 16" September (i.e. the first day after rolling over into TP 09 BP 01). Such a
variance was consistently reported each time a Cash Declaration was made.

What I have attempted to do below is to reproduce the sequence of activities and screens that
the User (JTH001) would have gone through when carrying out the Balancing process.

We have attempted to create accurate reports as they would have appeared at the
time. The screens have been recreated as accurate as possible. The Date and Time at
the top of each screen have not been adjusted and reflect the time that the transaction
sequence was ran on the test system. All attempts have been made to ensure that the
values in other parts of the screen are accurate.

Figure 11 — Revised Trial Balance

In Figure 11, I have highlighted the differences from Figure 7, namely that the Discrepancy
figures have been zeroised and the Total Payments no longer matches Total Receipts.

The consequences of this are that the Discrepancy (which was in the postmaster’s favour in
this case) has been lost and so the postmaster will not be advised that they can remove the

£88.77 surplus.

Note also that if this had occurred, then a Receipts and Payments mismatch event would have

been recorded and a message would have been displayed to the User.

However they decide to roll into a new BP instead and so select the Roll Over button and the

screen in Figure 8 is redisplayed.

This time the Next BP button is selected. This results in the Final Balance for the BP being

printed.

This would have matched the Trial balance shown above other than saying it was a Final

Note that the user is not warned about receipts and payments mismatches on the
Final balance as it is assumed that they would already have been seen on the trial
balance.

This particular bug shows that is not necessarily the case!

Also note that no Business event indicating a Receipts and Payments mismatch is
generated during the printing of the Final balance.

However a System (NT) Event is generated at this point regarding the Receipts and
Payments mismatch.

Figure 12 is displayed for the User to confirm that the Final balance has printed OK. On
