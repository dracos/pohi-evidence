I was disappointed to see CAR‘s and Release Cbligations being raised
by Pathway at the CNT's of ath May and 29th May 1997 without any

prior discussion between ourselves.

We agreed at our meeting of 29 April 1937 that we would only use the
CNT as an escalation route for CAR’s / RO’s which were unable to be
resolved jointly between you and Warren Bell or myself.

Can you please confirm that in future we will abide by our agreement,
and if we are unable to resolve any CAR‘s / RO’s then they will be

escalated to the CNT by both of us.

This will ensure that both

parties at the CNT are aware of any issues, are properly briefed and
will be therefore able to deal with them and not waste CNT time.

For the record please see table below for status of those CAR’s /

RO's raised.

Dear John,

I am writing to inform you that POCL have decided to
stand down the team that was. in place to support HAPS
Direct Interface Testing (DIT). The team will stand down
tomorrow, 2 May 1997.

The decision was taken because the continual slippage of
the start date for DIT has resulted in increased costs
for no benefit. The team has had no work to do.

POCL are happy to reform the team upon request given 3
weeks notice, an agreéd Direct Interface Testing
Specification and a schedule of tests.

Yours sincerely

Outstanding Critical CARs and CCNs

Notwithstanding considerable efforts to get on tap of these, we find ourselves as we
go out of this week with the following dependencies still not nailed down.

Critical for Release 1c

1. Agreement on Release 1c Contents Description
2. Agreement on Pathway’s test plans
3. Resolution of CAS operating arrangements

On the first and second, we are having to assume that what we have submitted will be
acceptable. On the third, we assume that EDS will carry out the required CAS service
without there yet being a conclusion to our discussions on commercial arrangements.

Confirmation of your agreement to these assumptions would enable us to close these
CARs.

Critical CARS for Re!

CAPS 2.2: we seek positive confirmation that the code was frozen.and service made
available by the due date of 2™ June (one of the proposed “milestone” dates in Replan

Schedule B7).
CCNs : ICL Pathway Ltd

Critical or overdue CCNs are: Peltham

5. 81b, 82b, 91b, 93b, 100b, 114b, 115b, 127, 128, 140

The first is a Release le dependency not covered by any letter of comfort from Stuart
Riley. The amount of work is significant. It calls for extensive regression testing end
to‘end, the direct impact of which is to extend Release Ic timescales by some 4 wetks.
The indirect impact is to place more work on a team already stretched by CCNs 117,
122, 124 and others, thereby putting additional pressure on other timescales.
Nevertheless, we have been left in no doubt that we must make the changes to come
into. line with CAPS 2.2 and are proceeding accordingly.

To confirm comments made at CNT, we are working on the basis that Stuart's letter
of 30® April represents approval for 117 and 122a (which are critical components of
Release 2). At the same time, we took his letter as closure of the Replan CAR for
CAPS 3 design freeze which was duc by 27° March. Stuast’s letter signalled that the
DSS would probably want 124 to go ahead and that we should expect clarification in
short order. We still need to agree the details of this change and time is now pressing.
T discussed the above with Stuart today and we have agreed to seek to close
outstanding points down by CNT on Wednesday.

L understand from our conversation today, since confirmed by John Bennett, that a

batch of CCNs is in the pipeline: thank yon. It. would be helpful pending their
completion to know if that batch comprises the list under item.5 above.

b) The tariff code used in this search is either the code from a change
tariff command message (if one has been received) or the tariff code

tariffs so the search through the tariff file on the terminal continues until
gither three matches are found of the end of file is reached.
