Dear Mr Arbuthnot
Freedom of Information Request

I refer to your letter to our Chief Executive, Paula Vennells, received and dated 10
March 2015, in which you made a Freedom of Information Act request for a copy of
Second Sight’s Briefing Report — Part 2.

My colleagues in the Information Rights Team have written to you explaining that the
report is exempt from disclosure under the terms of the Act. However, we do of
course recognise your particular interest in the Complaint Review and Mediation
Scheme.

With that in mind, we will be happy to supply you with a copy of Second Sight'’s final
report at the same time as it is sent to Applicants to the Scheme and their advisors.
Please note that this is a discretionary measure on our part and that, that given the
report's purpose and content, we will be sending it to you under strict conditions of
confidentiality.

Yours sincerely
Tom Wechsler
Scheme Secretariat
