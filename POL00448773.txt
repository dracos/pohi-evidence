Hi all,

Thank you for taking the time to attend the second Postmaster Voice workshop — and those of you who joined our first
workshop. I hope you found it informative and useful to explore options and to share perspectives. Personally, I valued
greatly your collaborative spirit and dedication to ensuring the Post Office has a sustainable future built on trust and
partnership.

We agreed that the priorities should be shared with the Chairman for his Strategic Review, and with the Senior Executive
Group. The attached Executive Summary is a draft that aims to distil those priorities into a statement that is easy to
understand and actionable. I have set up the statement to be ‘signed’ by attendees to demonstrate alignment around
what change is needed — alternatively we could just note who attended.

Please let Dan have your comments, or if easier to amend the document with tracked changes do provide those. I am
on annual leave for the next two weeks so I will leave Dan to finalize this with you.

We will organise a session in February 2025 to consider progress against the 4 areas highlighted in the Statement.

I have also attached the 2018 Franchise landscape report that Pip Wilkins from BFA referred to, as well as the slides that
Calum presented on the Postmaster Oversight Committee.

Many thanks
Charlotte
