Subject: Update on Daily Issues raised during Pilot - For review tomorrow 09:00.
HNG-X Daily Issues RAG Report - 2010-02-05.xIs

CWD Issue meeting Closed & Moved.doc

Please find attached a new table for tracking the Daily issues. It has
been built using the CWD meeting minutes. I suggest we use this table to
monitor these issues and capture any new ones.

I have included the 'final' version of the CWD meeting minutes to confirm
that all the outstanding actions have either been completed or have now
moved to the new table.
