I L1[11]ir.]iINkTir.iF1ir;




SJD3 having a telephone conversation with Mandy Talbot in relation to the draft Part 18
Request. I had sent her a revised draft Part 18 Request earlier today. She is happy for us to
send the Part 18 Request and to say that we will only mediate after he answers it. We need
to really put pressure on him to answer it so that we can make more informed decisions
about the case going forward. She was also happy for me to send my fax to Castleton's
solicitors about the mediation.

She reiterated that the Post Office are not going to settle this case lightly and her view is
that they should take it Trial just to take a firm line and show they were taking a firm line,
even if they lose (which she doesn't think they will). However, we should be seen to be
settling and that's way she is willing to agree to Castleton's offer of mediation.

She is happy with the draft Directions and suggested that a minor amendment i.e. that the
expert also be IT literate as well as an expert in accountancy.

Time engaged:
