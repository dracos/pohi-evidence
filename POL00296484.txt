Hi Simon.

My understanding is that the versions sent to Second Sight were the ones settled by Bond Dickinson and signed off by
Alwen/Susan.

If so, then they are for wider circulation and should have the confidential markings removed from them.

Kind regards, Rodric

It is ok for second sight to share these documents with others isn't it, if so should we remove the confidential
markings from these?

Thanks Simon. These are very well written responses. They are, of course, marked Strictly Private and Confidential.

We will need POL's approval therefore to disclose each response to the applicable SPMR in order to arrive at closure
on each Spot Review. We would also like to include Alan Bates and Kay Linnell in that process. Is that acceptable to

you?

Thanks and regards. Ron.
