And just to let you know, the UQ bid has now been rejected so there will be no UQ on this after PMQs.

Morning Laura,

We had advised No10 this morning about the prospect of an UQ and they have asked us to double check their Post
Office script. Grateful if you could cast your eyes over it, making any changes in tracked mode and returning by latest
10.45am... sorry!

Regards,

Abdurrahman Tavernier.
