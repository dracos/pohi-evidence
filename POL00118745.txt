I recently wrote to you, on 13 June 2006, in reference to the fact that one of
your joint account holders; Mr D E & Mrs J Hamilton had given signed

authority for bank account details to be disclosed to me.

Unfortunately, to date I have not received any such details from you. As this
information has been requested as part of a criminal investigation that I am
conducting, I would be grateful if you would arrange for copies of the
requested statements to be sent to me as soon as possible.

A copy of my original correspondence to you is enclosed for reference.

I appreciate you giving this matter your attention.

Please feel free to contact me should you require any further information.

Yours faithfully.
