5 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This section lists the identifier of each Acceptance Criterion that will be
demonstrated by the Acceptance Test. It also lists the Acceptance Test Conditions
that are used to determine whether (or not) the Acceptance Criterion has been met
together with the applicable test Phase, Technical Test, or Live Trial.

Acceptance Criteria are split into three sets of tables according to the nature of the
acceptance method, one set for those tested by Acceptance Trial, a second for those
tested by Acceptance Review and a third which lists those criteria which are for
Acceptance at a later release. The Release on which Acceptance is to be conducted
is defined by reference to the Release Contents Description included in the
Associated Documents section of the Acceptance Specification. Exceptionally, it
may be necessary for one particular Acceptance Criterion to be tested by a
combination of trial and review in which case there are entries for Trial and Review.

5.1. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND TEST CONDITIONS

Conformance of the End to End Service Acceptance Criteria will be demonstrated
through Acceptance Trials and/or Acceptance Reviews.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Trials comprise practical tests using prepared test
scripts. If applicable the Test Condition(s) appropriate to a criterion are specified
in section 5.1.1 together with a description of the test. Detailed composition of the
test in terms of sequences of Test Conditions is contained in Section 10. In the
tables in section 5.1.1 the rows labelled Function Run Entry will be populated
immediately prior to the running of the Acceptance Trials in a working version of
the Acceptance Specification. These will provide invigilators with references to the
checklists used to monitor the progress of the testing. The order of running of Test
Conditions will not necessarily correspond to the order presented in HLTPs
because of the “physicalisation” of the testing. The Function Run Entry will allow
the invigilator to read across from the criterion to the checklist.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Review comprise typically document reviews, site
visits or presentations. If applicable the Test Condition(s) are described in section
5.1.2.

Letter Pat Kelsey to Jim Morley 23/7/97, (25)

The performance of the End to End element of Integration
Test.

The overall objectives for E2E, in association with Model
Office Rehearsal, centre on the bringing together of the IT
functionality across all the participating systems, with the
operational and business procedures, to form an overall
business system. E2E and MOR activities are planned and
scripted together, run on the same environment, and
involve the same personnel. E2E forms a natural extension
of DIT. It is run in parallel with, but separate from, MOR.
The E2E agreed test report contains no non-conforming
entries for Pathway-specific elements.

Note: Pathway has the right of approval of the HLTP and
the associated Test Report as it affects the Pathway
elements.

Requirement

(a)

(2)

The CONTRACTOR shall develop and maintain the
Service Architecture Design Document, a document
describing the design of the Service Architecture.

As a minimum the Service Architecture Design
Document shall specify:

(a) the major components, provided directly or sub-
contracted, used in providing the Services;

(b) the functionality within the major components;
(c) the interfaces between the major components;

(a) the Service Levels required across the interfaces
to meet the objectives of the overall Services;

(e) all the interfaces with the Service Environment
and with other parties’ computer systems.

The audience for the Service Architecture Design
Document shall be technical staff within the
AUTHORITIES. The Service Architecture Design
Document shall be self contained, though it is
expected that it references other documents to provide
further levels of detail as appropriate. The level of
detail within the Service Architecture Design
Document shall be such that it gives a thorough
background to the construction of the Services and the
rationale for the approach. It is anticipated that the
Service Architecture Design Document shall be
between 200 and 400 pages in length.

A satisfactory document has been developed and
maintained

Requirement

The Services may, during the lifetime of the Related
Agreements or at termination, need to be replaced or
supplemented with services provided by other suppliers. It
shall therefore be both technically and commercially viable
for the Services to be replaced by and/or interfaced to
services from other suppliers. To support this, the
CONTRACTOR shall declare all internal interfaces
between separate Services within the overall Service
Architecture (including those between PAS and CMS, PAS
and the POCL Infrastructure Services, CMS and the POCL
Infrastructure Services). For each interface the
CONTRACTOR shall provide an interface specification
covering the same properties and to the same level of
detail as requirements 934-940 and 942.

6. ACCEPTANCE INCIDENT SEVERITY

This section identifies the guidelines to be applied during the analysis of
Acceptance Incidents, in order to establish the severity of such Acceptance
Incidents.

64 HIGH SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a substantive impact on
the service received by the Customer, e.g. failure to pay benefits to the right person,
at the right place, at the right time.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a major impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where
there was a major impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES
necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. failure to support
accurate POCL accounting.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the
service where there is no acceptable procedural workaround.

Consistent failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels, e.g.
where particular transactions do not meet the minimum Acceptable Threshold
under normal loading.

6.2 MEDIUM SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is visible to the Customer and is
likely to give rise to an adverse public perception of the service, but does not
substantively impact the service received by the Customer, e.g. incorrect spelling
on a receipt.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a medium impact on
the ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or
where there was a medium impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or
AUTHORITIES necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-
production of a weekly report, resulting in its manual transcription, which causes
additional resource or effort at every outlet of the average duration of one hour per
week per outlet.

Occasional failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels, e.g.
at peak loading, some transactions fail to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds,
but on average all transactions within the service do achieve Minimum Acceptable
Thresholds.

6.3. LOWSEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion that is neither visible to nor has
substantive impact on the service received by the Customer e.g. presentational,
style and other cosmetic faults that are only visible to the user.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a minor impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where
there was a minor impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES
necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-production of a
weekly report, resulting in its manual transcription, which causes additional
resource or effort at ten or fewer outlets of the average duration of one hour per
week per outlet.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the
service but where the workaround is as secure as the original solution (i.e. the only
impact on risk is in ensuring that the workaround is performed, but where
procedures have been agreed and are in place).

progress and actions of both parties until Acceptance of the Acceptance Test is
achieved. The time and location of review meetings will be scheduled with at least
two week’s advance notice by Pathway.

9. CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES

The Contractor shall nominate a Test Manager for each Test who shall be the single
point of communication and co-ordination with the AUTHORITY’s or
AUTHORITIES’ Test Manager for all matters concerning this Acceptance Test from
its initial planning through to Acceptance.
