(TC: 00:01:43)
Natasha Bernard: Right, now, because you're suspected of having committed a criminal offence
which may result in a criminal prosecution, I must inform you that you do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned, something which you later
rely on in court. Anything you do say, may be given in evidence. Do you understand the caution?


(TC: 00:02:04)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes.


(TC: 00:02:04)
Natasha Bernard: Just so that I can satisfy myself that you do understand the caution, can you
explain to me what your understanding of the caution is?


(TC: 00:02:12)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Basically, um, to bring open everything that um, needs to be discussed regarding the
discrepancy.

Natasha Bernard: Okay, let me explain what the caution is in full. So, that you're under-, you
know exactly what the caution means.


(TC: 00:02:26)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Of course.


(TC: 00:02:27)
Natasha Bernard: Because that is important. I'm the investigator employed by Post Office Ltd.


(TC: 00:02:31)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Mmhmm.


(TC: 00:02:32)
Natasha Bernard: To investigate possible criminal offences.


(TC: 00:02:34)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Mmhmm.


(TC: 00:02:34)
Natasha Bernard: You are suspected of having committed a criminal offence. Do you understand
that?


(TC: 00:02:37)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Mmhmm.


(TC: 00:02:38)
Natasha Bernard: Is that yes?


(TC: 00:02:39)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yup, yes.

(TC: 00:02:44)
Natasha Bernard: I will record your answers to those questions.


(TC: 00:02:46)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Mmhmm.


(TC: 00:02:47)
Natasha Bernard: Do you understand that?


(TC: 00:02:47)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes.


(TC: 00:02:48)
Natasha Bernard: Firstly, a person who is being interviewed for a suspected criminal offence, does
not have to say anything. You do not have to answer my questions, do you understand that?


(TC: 00:02:56)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes.


(TC: 00:02:58)
Natasha Bernard: Secondly, if you say nothing now, but in court you give an explanation which
could have been given now, then the court may think that, that explanation is untrue, or you have
made it up. Do you understand that?


(TC: 00:03:08)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes, yes.


(TC: 00:03:09)
Natasha Bernard: Thirdly, anything you say during the interview is being recorded on tape, and
can be read out in court, do you understand that?


(TC: 00:03:16)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes, mmhmm.

(TC: 00:14:22)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Because I already paid for this.


(TC: 00:14:25)
Adrian Morris: Right.


(TC: 00:14:25)
Oyeteju Adedayo: This was like a um, second charge. Although that house urn, sold, they've got a charge
on this.


(TC: 00:14:32)
Adrian Morris: Yes.


(TC: 00:14:33)
Oyeteju Adedayo: You understand? So, this was like a second charge.


(TC: 00:14:36)
Adrian Morris: Right, okay, so, it' s just the full mortgage. So, you bought that for £225,000? So, how
much did you pay for this one then?

Oyeteju Adedayo: Yeah, everything.


(TC: 00:14:54)
Adrian Morris: Okay. Um, and you said that you come in on a Wednesday to do the balancing. Urn, what
about the rest of the week, like the cash declarations, does Joan do all the cash declarations?


(TC: 00:15:05)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Joan does all the cash declarations.


(TC: 00:15:06)
Adrian Morris: She does that, does she? Right, it's just the Wednesday you come in?

Oyeteju Adedayo: No, it' s okay.


(TC: 00:15:15)
Adrian Morris: Oh, sorry, I thought you said something then. So, Jo-, Joan does the cash declarations
Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. But you do-, you do all the balancing on a
Wednesday?


(TC: 00:15:23)

(TC: 00:15:33)
Natasha Bernard: Okay, well obviously, um, the reason why we're here, is because there's a
discrepancy, of, let me just find the cash in writing. Was £53,000, I can't remember the rest, but
erm, it was about £53,200. I'll be able to get the exact figure. Um, this morning, when the auditor
came in, you gave him a note, about


(TC: 00:16:06)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes I did.


(TC: 00:16:09)
Natasha Bernard: Yeah, I've got that note here in front of me. Can you read it out for me please?


(TC: 00:16:12)
Oyeteju Adedayo: 'I have today, 5th September 2005 confessed to the auditor regarding the sum of
£50,000 taken, with my mentioning it to my assistant that I was going to be repossessed and, since I have
equity, no mortgage on the Rainham Hill property, I have already applied for a £50,000 loan to pay back
to the Post Office, as this had not been my intention to take somebody else's money.'


(TC: 00:16:40)
Natasha Bernard: Alright, and you signed that?


(TC: 00:16:41)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yup.


(TC: 00:16:41)
Natasha Bernard: You agree you wrote that?


(TC: 00: 16:42)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes, oh yes.

(TC: 00:16:50)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Mmhmm.


(TC: 00:16:50)
Natasha Bernard: Okay, um, well what I want to do now, is to give you an opportunity to explain
erm, the shortage that we have in the Post Office accounts.


(TC: 00:17:01)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Unfortunately, I owe some people at the early stages of the buying, you understand?


(TC: 00:17:10)
Natasha Bernard: I didn't, sorry.


(TC: 00:17:10)
Oyeteju Adedayo: At the early stage of the buying.


(TC: 00:17:12)
Natasha Bernard: Buying of?


(TC: 00:17:13)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Buying of the actual business, you understand. And they wanted their money, or
obviously start plastering 'repossession' or whatever, on the door, or whatever. And, I didn't want all that,
with people coming in, neighbours and everything. So, I-, I spoke to them, I said, 'I will get the money, all
I need to do is ask for a mortgage, remortgage. I will give you your money. I am happy to go'. But it got
quite nasty in the guy in the process, that he wants his money. So, I came to Joan, and she saw it. I came
to her, I said, 'I am in a state here, because it' s a case of everybody knowing my business in the street' . I
say, 'We need to do some-, I need to do something.' And, I explained what has happened. Because, no
money, I didn't touch, the Post Office money at all. She is strict as well. Very, between us, we don't do it.


(TC: 00:18:15)

trouble_ She saw it. So she said, oh-, I said, 'If I give them ten, maybe they would give me time to
refinance the property and give them their money, with obviously the Post Office getting the ten.' In fact,
this situation wouldn't have got to this level, ' cause I nearly, nearly spoke to the, my initial written letter
manager (mw 18.45). I don't steal, period. I do not take anything, we are-, I mean, we-, we've rescued so
many books here for the Post Office. So-, and, that is why I don't want this unless there is an emergency.


(TC: 00:19:01)
Natasha Bernard: Right.


(TC: 00:19:00)
Oyeteju Adedayo: You understand. Well, this came up, and she-, she saw how distressed I was. So, it
was a case of, okay, if I give them that ten, we apply for the-, a remortgage, because there's no mortgage
really on the property. And, right now it's worth well over two-hundred-thousand, compared to when we
bought it. So, I said, let me, if I do that, and she dismissed of the matter. And, then the came again, they
said, ' Well, the time they've given me, has run out, they want their money' . You understand. And, at that
point, I said to Joan again, 'With everything I raise, I did not just go in there take it and get rid of, or try to
cover everyday things.' The only thing I covered is that I did not really call somebody to say, 'I have a
problem here' .


(TC: 00:19:47)
Natasha Bernard: Mmhmm.


(TC: 00:19:48)
Oyeteju Adedayo: You understand, and I said-, she said to me, ' Okay, what do you want to do?' . I said,
'The only thing I can do is ask them, what um, big, of value, you know, has to stand for me now. Rather
than them (TC: 00:20:00) embarrassing me in the whole of the street regarding the money I borrowed off
them. And, at that point I said, 'Look, if I offer you twenty-thousand, can you give me time, I've got
commercial mortgages that people have, ve applied to? This would not even have been noticed.

the £20,000, at that point, again.

months.

(TC:00:20:57)
Natasha Bernard: So, you've given £20,000, and you didn't get a receipt.


(TC: 00:20:59)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I didn't, because, as far as I-, I know, I owe it to them.


(TC: 00:21:03)
Natasha Bernard: Right.


(TC: 00:21:03)
Oyeteju Adedayo: At the early stages, because, when we were going to buy this as lease, we bought it for
£54,000, you understand, £55,000 stock was £11,000, which we managed to find but I knew that I owe
that money to them.


(TC: 00:21:18)
Natasha Bernard: Right, who's them? Who are the people that you're talking about?


(TC: 00:21:21)
Oyeteju Adedayo: They are, they are people we know, they're family, friends of family.


(TC: 00:21:28)
Natasha Bernard: Friends and family.


(TC: 00:21:29)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes, and that is the honest truth. I wouldn't lie about it. I owe it to them. If I had been
able to remortgage and they've given me time, I wouldn't have to. We've always sent back money because
we are self-sufficient. We've always, always, sent back money to the Post Office, every time. Even here
today two parcels were made-up ready to go. We've always, always sent back. The only thing that was
outstanding was the money which every time I meet with Joan to tell her, this is what I've-, this is the
stage of the, um, application, this is the stage of-, stage of the application and that is, you know, it wasn't
hidden. It was, she felt basically sorry for me because she knew that I'm not a troublemaker, but this was
getting to a point of real embarrassment, people were shouting. You understand. So, I gave it. And that is,
I'm not, I wouldn't lie about it. I didn't use it for anything else, I don't, I haven't been on holiday since I
took over here.

Natasha Bernard: Mmm.


(TC: 00:22:32)
Oyeteju Adedayo: So, it' s not like, 'Oh, she was busy, you know, gallivanting,' I've never really shirked
the responsibility here. The only problem is that the initial money we borrowed from them, and if they'd
given me time, I can show you letters that I've, you know, people who I've applied loans from. To, to-, for
a remortgage, because of the amount I have.


(TC: 00:22:57)
Natasha Bernard: Umhmm.


(TC: 00:22:57)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I said, 'I want to secure it on the property,' I don't want to do short-term loan, because
short-term loan is very expensive to pay and, if the property has got no mortgage on it, and-, and a lot of
them are looking at it. I was supposed to yelled at from one of them this week.


(TC: 00:23:16)

Oyeteju Adedayo: It's to, it' s initial, because I didn't want to sell my property. I wasn't sure what I was
walking into. You understand. We were going to move, the kids were young, we were going to move
down here. And, I said, 'Well, if we go forward and the forward is ongoing, at least we've got the house to
go back to' . You understand. So, I did not want to sell that because I wasn't-, I-, I wasn't ready, to just put
in all the eggs in one basket, at that time.

Oyeteju Adedayo: The repayment was not sent to one of them. The repayment was not sent out because
the whole idea was when I start getting better, I will keep all the money back. You understand. But they-,
they realise, obviously, that I sold Berkshire property, this is where the stress start coming in.


(TC: 00:2.5:11)
Natasha Bernard: Right.


(TC: 00:25:13)
Oyeteju Adedayo: They-, they realised that they knew about our property thing, and they realise that I've
sold it, which was not kept for them, but it was a case of, shall we still stay here with three grown-up
children in one room, or what? So, the whole idea was the time, which they don't want to wait for.
Obviously, they feel that, at this time, it should be okay, you should be able to give us back our money.
Which I don't hide anything from them, they knew that I have got no more mortgage on this property.


(TC: 00:25:43)
Natasha Bernard: Right.

(TC: 00:25:43)
Oyeteju Adedayo: You understand. I think that's were the pressure started. Because, obviously they knew
that we've sold that, we sold the Berkshire property, we've moved out of Berkshire completely now. We
are now here.


(TC: 00:25:56)
Natasha Bernard: Right, and when was Berkshire, when did you, um, sell that?


(TC: 00:25:58)
Oyeteju Adedayo: 2003.


(TC: 00:25:59)
Natasha Bernard: 2003.


(TC: 00:26:00)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Mmhmm.


(TC: 00:26:03)
Natasha Bernard: So, with the money that you got from there, from the Berkshire property, why
didn't you pay them back out of that?


(TC: 00:26:10)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I know, I know, I-, I-, looking back, I know, but like I explained to you, and which I
would not lie. I was sleeping on the floor here, with my husband, and three kids were sleeping in a-, on a
bunk bed.


(TC: 00:26:26)
Natasha Bernard: Right.


(TC: 00:26:26)
Oyeteju Adedayo: In one bedroom. And, it was a case of, let me buy this, because if it's, off um-,
mortgage, I can get a property, then I can pay them. Raise-, re-, remortgage the property. I was talking to
somebody who is very close who said, and she said, 'Remortgage it. Give them their money, let them go.',
but they don't want to wait for their money, the taxman.


(TC: 00:26:54)
Adrian Morris: So, you bought this place for £100,000.

Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes.


(TC: 00:26:58)

(TC: 00:27:11)
Adrian Morris: Okay, that's, that's, okay, T understand that. So, what happened to the other £75,000,
then?


(TC: 00:27:17)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I know, because we owe mortgage there so, obviously the mortgage company took
their own.

(TC: 00:27:24)
Oyeteju Adedayo: They've, paid the mortgage off there. And, what is left was what we had, to pay off-,
to pay off this. I won't lie, I won't lie. I hate it, I-, this-, this, I-, I-, I don't have either, I won't lie. It upset

Oyeteju Adedayo: Of the business. That I bought the lease from, was giving us a lot of, a lot, a lot of

(TC: 00:32:15)
Oyeteju Adedayo: So, we were renting. We were renting downstairs. Upstairs wasn't available to us. You
understand. She was renting it out. And, at that time, Ijust felt that she didn't want to give, she didn't want
to give it up. Because, we approach, in fact it went to High Court. Everything went to High Court on the
matter. Because, she didn't. Our house went shortly after we got the property, and I just get the feeling
that she didn't want to sell to us any more, you understand? But, I said it to her, I said, 'If we didn't have
this on paper, you would have sent-, more or less run us out of town', with £50,000, I probably would
have been killed by the family. I said,' With £50,000 plus.'


(TC: 00:32:55)
Adrian Morris: So, she was renting this out, was she?


(TC: 00:32:55)
Oyeteju Adedayo: 'Owed.' She was renting the upstairs, out.


(TC: 00:32:58)
Adrian Morris: Okay.


(TC: 00:32:59)
Oyeteju Adedayo: She was renting it out, I don't know, some guy that worked one time.


(TC: 00:33:02)
Adrian Morris: And, where were you living at that time?


(TC: 00:33:04)
Oyeteju Adedayo: We were renting a property down in (mw 33.04) Road, there. And when I approached
her about buying, because it was just getting far too expensive to do this so, we were paying our rent, we

being paid out, you understand? So, when I said to her, 'We want to buy'. That was when the initial
problems started. She would not, until the barr-, a barrister got involved, the um, Association of National
Federation helped us find a solicitor. All this is proof I' m not lying. That was when they managed to get
her to initially. So, that money was paramount for me to really give, you understand? It was paramount
for me to get a mortgage really, get a mortgage so I can get everything sorted. So, she can go. That was

Oyeteju Adedayo: Was initial. That was the lease.


(TC: 00:34:04)
Natasha Bernard: Right.


(TC: 00:34:05)
Oyeteju Adedayo: That was the lease. Because, we already paid £5,000 to the solicitor.


(TC: 00:34:10)
Natasha Bernard: Right.


(TC: 00:34:11)
Oyeteju Adedayo: You understand, and she said that if we mess up, she was going to sit on the £5,000.
She already set out dates and everything for us to-, to exchange contracts.


(TC: 00:34:21)
Natasha Bernard: Mmhmm.


(TC: 00:34:23)
Oyeteju Adedayo: And she, more or less, I had to get them all to chip the money in for us.


(TC: 00:34:28)
Natasha Bernard: Right.


(TC: 00:34:28)
Oyeteju Adedayo: On this time because, my initial reaction, which we had a letter that time, I can't

sit on the initial deposit' .

(TC: 00:35:07)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Oh, they would.

Oyeteju Adedayo: I can't, because I think, at this point in time, as far as they are concerned, we owe all
that money, why are you dragging us into this? Which I can understand. I would-, I did not do anything
with that money, apart from what I've said. I did not do nothing. I don't touch the Post Office money at
all. I don't.

Adrian Morris: The actual process, what happened? You came in, you told Joan.


(TC: 00:36:08)
Oyeteju Adedayo: 1 spoke to Joan. 1 spoke to Joan about it. She saw how distressed I was, she knew,
because I said to her, right now they're threatening to start causing a bit of a problem. I need to give them
something, at least then, maybe that will give me time to get a mortgage, remortgage.


(TC: 00:36:27)
Natasha Bernard: Right.

Oyeteju Adedayo: Through, which already, I started processing, as soon as I knew they wanted their
money, it was.

Natasha Bernard: Well, you've know for six years they've wanted their money, surely?


(TC: 003635)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I know, I know, but I thought the initial, at that time things were not strict. Because,
obviously 2000, and 2001, I was at work with the previous owner trying to fight.

Oyeteju Adedayo: To get the freehold of the flat. Because, at that time there was no-, we-, that was why
we stayed in here, when we finally got it. I don't lead a luxurious lifestyle, I can assure you. But, that was
with the initial state-, um, thing was. The money, we were spending was too much. We were spending
£600 with, um, rent. We were giving out £500 here, surely, mortgage cannot be that much if everything is
put under one umbrella. And, at that time, we were having a lot of work. So, they knew that I was, err,
having problems with the previous owner.


(TC: 00:37:25)
Natasha Bernard: Okay, so, you went on, you went, and you spoke to Joan. Why did you speak to
Joan?


(TC: 00:37:31)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Oh, I had to speak to her because-,


(TC: 00:37:33)
