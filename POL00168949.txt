Andy,

Please find attached the Investigation Reports on which I have highlighted in black the parts which
I would advise be redacted. Consequently I have also further amended the draft Report in light of
the redactions.

I would prefer not to let the Applicant see the sentence in Diane Matthews’ report of 25'" October
2005 which noted that she was “...currently awaiting the results of the tests by Fujitsu on the Horizon
system” if those test results cannot be found. Such a sentence may well invite a request for
disclosure of the test results. There may also be a risk that the Applicant will suggest that the
investigation was inadequate or incomplete. Similar issues could arise out of the comment on page
7 of the draft report; “However it appears that the kit was taken by Fujitsu to allow the equipment testing
to be undertaken. No documentation is available in relation to this.”

Kind regards,

Martin.

Martin Smith

Thanks — if you could mark on the docs any bits that you would prefer to be redacted that would be great.

Kind regards

Hi Andy,

Thank you for your e-mail; It would appear that Harry Bowyer looked at an earlier version of the
proposed response sometime ago and before we were asked to suggest amendments on draft
responses using Track Changes. In those circumstances I have added comment to the latest version
of the proposed response which I have attached hereto.

Whilst we have advised that as a matter of principle investigation and offender type reports
should not be disclosed, I understand that there will be cases in which it is felt that there is no
alternative other than to disclose these. In such circumstances they should be appropriately
redacted. If you would like me to deal with that, please let me know.

The disclosure of redacted reports may lead to requests for the disclosure of such reports in other
cases.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you wish to discuss.

Kind regards,

Martin.

Martin Smith
