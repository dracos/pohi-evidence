Drop Down Issues

A list of 15 ‘drop down’ issues was-tabled at the meeting for review
(copy attached). It was confirmed that this was the entire list and that
no further additions would be made or permitted.

Contractua] Issues:
Release-2+ (Relief)

The concept was understood and a way forward had been discussed
with the CNT. Language was being drafted. This issue had to be
discussed in the PDA in conjunction with Release I contents, the two
issues being interdependent.

Pat Kelsey to ensure drafting completed by Monday 11 November. I
Agreements to Agree Relief I
ICL Pathway had_a concern that they might be held responsible for

omissions in their services due to failure of “agreements to agree”. It

had previously been agreed to make explicit that this would not be the
case. Lawyers were drafling suitable text. It was expected to be

SLA Issue
2.5 SLA Transaction Tiines

Due to “agreements to agree” Schedule B3.has.been incomplete as.to
the transaction times against which service.levels may be monitored.

Pathway would issue a paper (version 3), incorporating PDA comments
on an early draft, by Friday 8 November: The general feeling was that
the PDA were‘comfortable with the status-reached and expected the
‘issue to’ be resolved and not impact the “drop:down’ date:
Action 5 Pathway paper to be issued to PDA by Friday 8 November.
CCN Issue
2.6 CCN Agreements

A list of the 39 CCN’s raised by Pathway was issued at the meeting

FUJ00079000
FUJ00079000

Requirements:into line, were ‘known changes’ and were therefore
expected to be'cleared quickly - and John Savage (Pathway) and
Bernard Jenkins (PDA) were working closely to finalise before the 15
November. Pathway confirmed that there-weré no further CCN’s to be
forthcoming as part of the ‘drop down’ process.

It was noted that:the number of CCN’s raised by all parties should be
kept to a minimum with zero changes being the.aim.

Action 6 Pat Kelsey and John Bennett to ensure completion of the CCN process
by 15 November.

Programme Issuiés
2.7 Pathway Release 1 Content

The three main documents specifying R1 content were:
V4 detailed applications (BES / AP)

Security measures

(ii) PDA comments on V5'by Friday 8 November
(iii) Contents to be brokered / negotiated with Stakeholders
(initial views already obtained from POCL)
(iv) Further negotiations with Pathway

Action 8 — John Meagher to confirm acceptance.
2.10 Security Functional Specification

It was noted that security was paramount and that fraud reduction was a
Key objective of the Programme.

A form of words which would allow the FS to be signed off by the
PDA, (with-normal process to be followed for subsequent.controlled
documents), was reviewed and agreed at the meeting.

Action 9 — Pat Kelsey to ensure sign off process of Security Functional
: Spécification, having confirmed with PDA colleagues that there are no
remaining issues
Action. 10 Outside of the meeting, Bruce McNiven to follow up the issue of FRM
& Security with Gareth Lewis to see if the Release 1 content:can be

signed-off
2.11 Acceptance Criteria

Following a lengthy discussion it was agreed that the requirements
must be delivered using ICL Pathway’s solutions:as known and agreed.
There was concern'that to achieve this, the relevant'parts of the
solutions would need to be'mapped on to the various Acceptance
Criteria as submitted by ICL, Pathway and that was a significant
amount of work. However, Schedule C3 (Authorities’ Agreement)
confirms that requirements that must be satisfied by means of the
solutions, was seen as being sufficient. In addition, ICL Pathway
offered the PDA use of their ‘Access Database’ as a’“‘navigational tool”
in linking test. scripts, the FS:and the SADD

Action.11 Pathway to make their database available to the PDA

2.12 Severity Levels - Generic/BES

ICL Pathway had submitted examples of Severity Levels using BES as
a template. There has been much discussion on this subject: with the
CNT and it had been previously agreed that Severity Levels would
apply to incidents rather then criteria.

It was agreed that there would be joint working, using BES.as ari
illustrative example to resolve the issues of definition. The PDA
confirm this would not be a “sign-off” for BES.

Action 11 John Meagher and Terry Austin to progress jointly. .

Action 12 Pat Kelsey to ensure a CCN to reflects the change from ‘criteria’ to
‘incidents’.

Summary

In:summary, it was noted that a.lot of work was‘required in order to
clear‘all issues,.and the I S‘-November date was not.achievable in some
instances. The 29 November was believed to bée-a-more realistic
completion date.

Pat Kelsey and Tony Oppenheim to prepare a note to extend the
contract extrapolation date to 29 November. Subject to final
confirmation from the Programme Director, this would be signed by 15
November by Pat Kelsey and John Bennett.

Peter Crahan to broker the revised forecast complétion.date with
Stakeholders.

Development (update on-main deliverables)
OBCS and AP

Progressing to plan. Both products have moved into Pathway’s Product
Acceptance Testing phase.

EPOS

Product.reviews (by PDA)-that were planned to be completed at end of
October were ongoing. The impact of this was'to be assessed.

Terry Austin to report to John Meagher the:results of the impact
assessment on 7 Noveniber.

BES

Pathway work is currently 6 days behind schedule..A review of testing
timescales to be:carried out (including the joint testing. team) to
determine options/ impact of slotting BES testing in at a later than
planned date.

There appears to be a differing view between the PDA and Pathway as
to what work, has been done and what is curreritly. available for PDA
review. Terry Austin was reviewing the.position and would arrange for
a presentation of BES Ao selected PDA staff (to include Colin Odout).
