Thanks very much Susan.

I think I am up to date, and understand the issues, so probably no need for
a special update.

Look forward to seeing/hearing the normal Board update when appropriate.
Thanks again

All the best

Neil

Paula Vennells;

Dear everyone,

Susan and I talked about this work today.

I thought this paper was clear and helpful. I am also glad that on the basis
of his conversation with Susan last week, Alasdair Marnoch thought that the
right immediate issues were being tackled in the right way at the right
speed.

I had some thoughts which I want to put on the record about the way ahead.
First, while it is clear that we are committed to using SS for the 47 cases
which are already in the frame for their review, it is extremely important
that we cap their involvement at that. The moment they are involved in
additional cases beyond these, we will have lost the ability to end the
relationship with them - an outcome which I do not want to have to
contemplate. I understand that this means we have to find a way of
satisfying James Arbuthnot and the JFSA that we have a credible alternative
way of handling additional cases. So the sooner we can do this, the better.
Second, we need to pin down and cap SS's costs. I understand from Susan that
she has told them that she is expecting them to do the extra work pro bono
but no deal has been done. I understand that Chris will be bottoming this
out urgently and that there will be a cap on any additional payments to
them.

Third, we need a proper process for appointing the independent Chair of the
working party. We cannot afford to make the wrong choice here. We need to
draw up a clear description of the role and the qualities we are looking for
and then interview some people who appear to fit the bill, and reference
them properly (ie conversations not bits of paper).

Finally, I have asked Susan to keep the Board fully informed of future
developments and to alert me to anything which she is unable to resolve
which could get in the way of getting the job done in the way it needs to be
done.

She will be seeking conversations about all this with all the NEDs on an
individual basis and will be in touch with you to arrange these.

Best wishes

Alice

Apologies all, it should have been this version of the note attached to
yesterday's email, which incorporates the insurance information (at
paragraph 31) rather than leave that in a standalone note. It also includes

a couple of additional sentences on accounting arrangements at paragraph 24.
Thanks,

Martin

Susan

Thanks Alwen

For the benefit of the other Board members I had a very good review with
Susan and Alwen earlier this week focused mainly on the history and
immediate actions we are taking to dealing with the urgent case review. I
was reassured by the energy, resource and prioritisation of the work we are
doing and I think it's fair to say on this we are working through as quickly
as is practical.

In our discussion with Susan, Alwen explained why the case review was only
going back to 2010 and the significance of a Horizon upgrade (full

reconciliations across every site etc). Could Alwen please elaborate on this
point as a critical issue will be determining how far back we need to go.

Also what's the legal position with Fujitsu - do we think they are in any
way culpable (and have we had our view verified) and have we taken any
action (noting that they have offered to pay£100k in support of costs)?
Finally I seem to be missing the insurance update - could you please resend.
