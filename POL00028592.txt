4 Introduction

This report is produced by the POCL Service Management team and provides a high level “in-flight” assessment of any
threats to overall business continuity in the Congo 4 live service environment. The primary purpose is to identify any issues
(actual or potential) that might threaten the Congo 4 roll-out or regression from ICL Pathway services. It should be noted
that this report may have an operational bias.

For ease of reference, the report utilises a traffic light system with the following keys -

The next full Horizon Service Report is scheduled for W/C 28 September 1998.

There is no change in the overall status of business continuity, it remains at ‘Amber’, due to the continuing presence of incomplete
(lost) transactions. Positive developments, however, have taken place and software fixes are in the pipeline for User Setup,
Incomplete Receipts, BES/OBCS Corruption, User logout and New Card Activation - which is a category newly identified.

5.1

Benefit Payment System
Incomplete Transactions @
Remains at Red due to the continuing levels of ITs.

There are five categories this month. The major factor this period is due to a single category, BES/OBCS Corruption
(47% of all ITs), contributing to the steep rise.

Desired outputs from the operational workshop have been implemented and the resultant fixes for various categories of
ITs have been placed in testing. Evaluation and analysis of these fixes are imminent. If solutions prove successful it is
foreseen that categories of LTs and consequently volumes will reduce dramatically - particularly that mentioned in para
1above. Forecast implementation is 22 September 1998 on the assumption that testing is successful and passes
acceptance by the sponsor organisations.

Baseline for Incomplete Transactions

To provide a baseline against which incomplete transactions can be assessed figures have been produced to show the
volume of incomplete transactions per 10,000 encashments. The baseline is adjusted to reflect actual monthly ITs.
Secondly a target figure is shown of incomplete transactions that POCL should be aiming to receive prior to the advent

of Live Trial.
Note that commencing, this month the target level of ITs per 10K of received encashments has been adjusted down to

zero. This indicates that POCL would expect nil ITs from a robust automated system capable of preventing ITs.
Current month level of IT per 10,000 encashments received 5.6
Target level of IT per 10,000 encashments received 0

Transaction Processing & ICL Pathway Interface
Incomplete Transactions

The transaction Processing, & ICL Pathway interface remains on ‘Amber’ status, with incomplete transactions having a

large impact on this.
Factors which are of concern are:

e Cash account errors
Accounting & Reconciliation

Appendix ‘A’ details an agreed summary of accounting & reconciliation for the July period.

BES: Volumetrics

Definitions for the purpose of this report.

A transaction is an incident of “a recorded and auditable instance of business activity, involving Service provision or Stock
movement across organisational or Service boundaries”.

A payment is the Child Benefit allowance money due for one week, or for four weeks (in the case of a four- weekly
allowance).

An encashment is a measure of the work effort in a customer session from the clerk accepting the payment card to

returning, the card with monies, i.e. one customer is paid all due Child Benefit allowance. Thus, a customer may save
several payments before visiting their PO. During such a transaction there will be one encashment of several payments.

¢ GENERAL RECONCILIATION PERFORMANCE

A drop of nearly 7% in the volumes has seen transactions returning to expected seasonal levels. Reconciliation
progress remains at an acceptably high level.

¢ CONCERNS

This period - ratio of incidents to transactions 1:930 Last period showed 1: 1682.

A number of factors came into play to affect the sharp decline in the ratio of incidents to transactions for July.

The first was the drop in the volume of transactions (over 6%) and secondly the rise in the number of incidents (74)
of which 17 were duplicated transactions (23% of all incidents this month).

¢ IMPROVEMENTS

Incomplete Transactions form 53% of all incidents received this month and still occupy major concerns. However a

number of fixes have been proposed which will address and seek to reduce volumes in the categories of “Incomplete
. aia ial “User Logouts”, “BES/OBCS Corruption” and “User Set-up”.
