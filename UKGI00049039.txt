David,
I'm sorry to bother you at the weekend, but further to our conversation Ben Tidswell, the POL SID is keen to
speak to you. (Henry has done something this morning that has led Ben to think he needs to go asap).

Shall I ask him to email you, or if you're happy to speak to him, is there a number I can pass on for him to call
you on?

Thanks,
Lorna
