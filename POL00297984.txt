All: Could someone please forward this email to Andy Winn, whose email address I don't have
seem to have?

This is the email from Jenny O'Dell that represents the "where we are right now" on SRO21.
As I said, I'd hoped that, by spelling out what she was meant to have been doing, she would be
able to shed some light on the entries that she passed... and that she would yield up a clue as to
what might have triggered those 9 SANs that aggregated to £6,892.23. Her incoming July ist
email has given us no such clue I'm afraid.

As agreed on today's call, this is a case that might be capable of being settled with the simple
and inexpensive 'pre-mediation' process... or certainly is likely to be settled through mediation
if an earlier meeting failed to close it down.

T will contact JOD to take this forward.
Thanks for today's helpful call.

>Dear Ron,
I don't understand what exactly you are asking me, am I thick or what?

I don't know what Saps or Sans is, or overages (can guess that that is more than something) I
wouldn't know what to do, to do a sap, san or overage. All I did was move stamps from
declaration two to declaration one, and specials from specials to normal.

This is what I did every month not just on November 4th.

If this does not answer your question, then perhaps talking to you on the phone might be best
than trying to write it down, did ring you this morning to do so and left a message.

T hope this makes sense.

Regards

Jenny O'Dell
