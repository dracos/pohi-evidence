LIVE FIX IMPACT

cost: 1.0 man day to fix and handover

IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT: Low. This fix can be (incrementally) implemented
within the current development schedule.

IMPACT ON USER: High. Without this change the impact on the customer could be
significant, in that supplied contractual evidence could be challenged in
court.

IMPACT ON OPERATIONS: None.

RISK: Low. This change is to be implemented in the Audit Extractor CLIENT on
the Audit workstations, 1 executable needs to be replaced, and 1 stored
rocedure in the Seal database.

TARGET RELEASE: Recommendation: BI3S30R, because of the potential to provide
invalid data to the customer.

lionel, this is the outstanding PinICL that needs to be targetted at BI3S30R,
land as mentioned on the phone. BSM
