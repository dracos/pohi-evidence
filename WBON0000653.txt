My initial inclination is to go with the QC that would actually be able to be in an appeal process...

Just a view.

Could go some way to answering the Al C point about "you lost" as my guess is he will at least want new blood in any
appeal team — so super silk will be needed.........

Have spoken with OEC and the possibilities on super silks are:

We can instruct Lord Neuberger to review the matter and provide advice on the merits of an appeal / recusal. He
would however not be able to represent POL in court at an appeal. If we want to instruct him we would need.to.__..
instruct him this week and get documents to him tomorrow as he is travelling to South Africa. He is{, GRO}

Lord Grabiner is currently under brief but would be able to review the matter and provide merits / advice on the
ppeal. If we would like to instruct him we will also need to instruct a couple of juniors (his working style). He is

I will put together an email to go to Jane, Rod, Mark with the two options. My thoughts are that we should get an initial
view from Lord Neuberger and if we decide that we want an super silk at the appeal then we could consider using Lord
Grabiner, but would welcome your thoughts.

Thanks
