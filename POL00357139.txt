Subject: RE: NFSP speech - Horizon coverage
Hi both

Was noisy first thing when the the issue arose but I had very few comments through the course of the day. Senior NFSP
have been relatively ok - can't promise there won't be a reaction from the floor but I am not getting a sense that they
are looking to make a big deal of this. George has been consistent on Horizon and am getting no indication this is
changing - he was very robust at a recent regional mtg I was at where a question was asked about the class action.

How much press has there been?

Nick
I was online just now as this came through. So, on Marks’ behalf, thought I’d check with you.

Paula is asking around Fed liaison re todays issue — do you have any info — so she is aware of what she’s coming into
tomorrow?

Thanks

Tom, I'd appreciate an opener for my speech tomorrow - can you liaise with Al. It's going to be embarrassing
(irrespective of vol of media coverage) and some NFSP colleagues will delight in trying to make me squirm (probably
rightly). I will wait and see but imagine that it will be best to go in on the front foot with an apology at the beginning,
rather than wait till the Q&A.

Mark, what have we said to the Fed, and how much have we kept them in the loop?

Thanks,
Paula

Mark, Tom given its going to hit the papers, it would be sensible to draft a short note to
go to the Board? Subject to Paula’s better judgement? Al

Subject: Horizon coverage

All

I wanted to let you know that there are likely to be a number of stories in the national
media tomorrow on this morning’s Horizon outage. We have taken calls, and dealt with
inaccuracies robustly, from most of the national media and some regionals today.

We will continue to monitor online coverage, and correct errors where we can, but I wanted
you to be aware, particularly in the light of NFSP conference.
