Riposte6210: Time synch doe not work

lA Client only synchronises on riposte start up but not thereafter.
scenari
set up a Client (7261,1) to neighbor a LAN-connected peer client (7261,2) and
lan ISDN-connected Virtual Correspondence Server (0,42) made up of 2
correspondence Servers, CSA (0,32) and CSB (0,33).

set the following riposte parameters on the Clients

1261,1 1261,2

f'imeSynchDriftLimit 5000 5000

[fimeSynchLevel 2 2

[timeSynchNodeId 42 1

start riposte on CSA, then 7261,1 and then 7261,2 and check riposte is in
synch on all 3 platforms.

Display clocks on all 3 above platforms and check the clocks are in synch.
ISA: Advance the clock by 15 minutes.

SA: riposteprioritymessage 30000 1 25 7261

the clocks on 7261,1 and 7261,2 should advance by 15 minutes but they do not.
[?261,1: riposteprioritymessage 30000 1 25 0

the clocks on 7261,1 and 7261,2 still do not advance by 15 minutes

[7261,1: Stop and restart riposte

7261,1: When riposte goes online the clock synchronises with CSA

1261,1: riposteprioritymessage 30000 1 25 0 followed by riposteputmessage 5
fhe clock on 7261,2 does not synchronise with 7261,1

[)261,2: Stop and restart riposte

[7261,2: When riposte goes online the clock synchronises with 7261,1

the last time Time Synch worked OK was on Riposte 6.2.8.

ff confirmed, this bug could possibly be an urgent show stopper, but is more
likely to be something we can live with for a while. I am asking Escher for
ldvice at this stage rather than an immediate fix. We have missed normal BI2
liclivery deadlines.

Escher Respons:
he interim time synch fix was provided to handle the delay of the marker
arrival that caused time drift. This fix also handles a situation of the
clock of the client being changed. In Pathway's test case, the clock of
the source machine was changed, and it was not handled properly by the new
code. This is a new error on our end and the fix is not trivial.

[the nature of this problem should not have a significant impact on the
Hive environment, unless it can be anticipated that the clock at the
servers ave to be changed/adjusted reqularly.
