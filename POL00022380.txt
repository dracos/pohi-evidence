Mark,

This is quite an impressive document and sets out our position in a balanced and credible manner.

I have tracked changes on both documents. I’ve also attached the Group Exec paper that details the
improvements made - appendix 1.

Thanks,
Angela

Subject: end of term report and thematic issues rebuttals

Evening all,
As discussed, attached are two documents:
1) The ‘end of term’ report v7. I have tidied up as best I can. There are a number of outstanding points and
comments to be decided upon. Can I suggest that unless you pick up upon a fundamental flaw, we leave this (in

the first instance at least) to Jane, Mark D and Patrick to read through and make track changes.

Rod — could you also please forward on to CK for comment over the weekend.

2) The thematic issues ‘rebuttals’ annex BC referenced at this afternoons meeting. I know Rod, Angela and Andy P
already have this on their ‘to do’ lists but if others also wish to take a look and comment, that would be
appreciated.

Many thanks. I won’t be picking up emails tomorrow, but will be back online Sunday.

Mark
