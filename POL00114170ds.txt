THE POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

Interim Disclosure Statement on behalf of Post Office Limited

1. I, Benjamin Andrew Foat of Finsbury Dials, 20 Finsbury St, London EC2Y 9AQ, am

Group General Counsel of Post Office Limited ("POL").

A. INTRODUCTION

2. This interim disclosure statement has been prepared in response to the request
made by the Inquiry in its letter dated 13 May 2022 for the provision of an interim
disclosure statement in relation to all of POL's disclosure to date, in accordance with
paragraph 18 of the Inquiry’s Protocol on the Disclosure of Documents. In that letter,
the Inquiry also requested an explanation for the discrepancy between the number
of documents produced by POL to the Inquiry and the number set out in a statement
made by POL's Chief Executive Officer, Nick Read, in an article that was published

in the Scotsman newspaper on 8 May 2022.

B. THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS PRODUCED BY POL

3. Dealing first with the discrepancy, the statement in the article that POL has provided
3 million documents to the Inquiry is incorrect. I am informed by the solicitors
representing POL in the Inquiry, Herbert Smith Freehills ("HSF"), that the
approximate number of documents that has been provided to the Inquiry as at the
date of this statement is 39,000. I am aware from Mr Read that he has written to the
Inquiry to apologise for the discrepancy and to explain the circumstances in which it

arose.

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

4. The discrepancy arose in the following circumstances, which have been established
by enquiries made by the POL in-house legal team of Mr Read, the POL
communications team and POL's external communications advisors, TB Cardew. In
advance of the Human Impact Hearings in Glasgow on 11 and 12 May 2022, the
POL communications team obtained an opportunity for Mr Read to explain briefly in
The Scotsman, amongst other things, how POL wishes to assist the work of the
Inquiry. TB Cardew produced a draft article, which was then reviewed by the POL
communications team and by Mr Read. The draft article included the reference to
3 million documents. The number was included by TB Cardew because they had
heard reference to it in a meeting but was not subsequently checked despite Mr

Read asking for it to be. The erroneous number therefore appeared in the article.

5. In the future, I have re-emphasied that any formal communication in the media
relating to the Inquiry will first be checked with POL's in-house legal team and
approved by POL's Inquiry Director, who are familiar with our work in relation to the

Inquiry.

c. OVERVIEW OF INTERIM DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

6. I turn now to the Inquiry's request for a disclosure statement.

7. I am the appropriate person to make the disclosure statement because following the
board's appointment of HSF I am ultimately responsible for instructing HSF in
respect of POL's response to each of the eleven requests made to POL by the
Inquiry under Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 ("Rule 9 Requests"), based on the
instructions that I and POL's in-house lawyers under the supervision of POL's Inquiry

Director receive from our colleagues in the business and ultimately the POL board.

8. This statement, including the Annex, constitutes POL's interim disclosure statement

in accordance with paragraph 18 of the Inquiry’s Protocol on the Disclosure of

11174749700_13 2
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

Documents. In this statement I set out POL's general approach to searches and
review of documents when responding to Rule 9 Requests received from the Inquiry
to date, including the main repositories, general limitations on searches of which
POL is aware and other relevant background. The Annex sets out POL's searches
and reviews of documents in respect of the requests made by the Inquiry of POL
before the Inquiry was on a statutory footing and each of the Inquiry's eleven Rule

9 Requests.
9. In this statement I address the following topics:
a. The origins and ownership of POL;
b. POL's retention policy and the document preservation holds in place;
c. POL's main repositories of electronic communications;
d. POL's main repositories of electronic documents;
e. POL's main repositories of hardcopy documents;

f. The databases of POL documents hosted on Relativity by KPMG, who are

POL's e-discovery provider;

g. POL's approach to encrypted files and the application of redactions for

privilege;

h. POL's control of documents, and categories of documents that are no longer

within POL's control; and
i. The reasonableness of POL's searches.
10. In this statement I also refer:

a. to steps and/or decisions taken by POL in connection with the Rule 9

Requests including with the assistance of HSF (and POL's other legal

11174749700_13 3
representatives).

POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement

27 May 2022

POL's communications with HSF (and other legal

representatives) were and remain by their nature privileged. For the

avoidance of doubt, any reference to discussions should not be taken as a

waiver of that privilege, whether expressly or impliedly.

b. to steps taken on behalf of POL by HSF and POL's other legal

representatives in connection with the Rule 9 Requests. For the avoidance

of doubt, any reference to steps taken by HSF and POL's other legal

representatives should not be taken as a waiver of privilege, whether

expressly or impliedly.

11. Where I refer to my belief and recollection, these beliefs and recollections are based

on the information provided to me by colleagues at POL, by HSF and by others that

have assisted POL in providing disclosure.

D. DEFINED TERMS

12. In this statement, I have used a number of acronyms and defined terms. I have set

out a definition of each, as I have introduced them. However, for convenience, I also

set out the definitions of these acronyms and definitions below:

Rule 9 Request Requests made to POL by the Inquiry under Rule 9 of the

Inquiry Rules 2006

E. ORIGINS OF POST OFFICE LIMITED
13. I set out below a brief explanation of the origins of POL, which are relevant to

understanding how documents are held by POL.
Post Office Limited as a legal entity

14. The Post Office Act 1969 established the Post Office as a statutory corporation,
replacing the General Post Office. In 1986, a restructuring took place in which the
operations of the Post Office were reorganised into three separate businesses:
Royal Mail Letters, Royal Mail Parcels and Post Office Counters. Post Office
Counters was incorporated as a limited company (Post Office Counters Limited) and

subsidiary of the Post Office in 1987.

15. In March 2001, the shareholding of Post Office Counters Limited was transferred to
Consignia plc, a public limited company ultimately owned by the Department of
Trade and Industry (through its holding company Consignia Holdings plc), as part of
restructuring effected under the Postal Services Act 2000. Post Office Counters
Limited was renamed Post Office Limited in October 2001, while Consignia plc was
renamed Royal Mail Group plc in November 2002 (and Consignia Holdings plc was
renamed Royal Mail Holdings plc at the same time). Royal Mail Group plc was

renamed Royal Mail Group Limited ("RMG") in March 2007.

11174749700_13 5
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

16. Following the Postal Services Act 2011, POL and RMG formally separated on 1 April
2012 (the "Separation"), with POL's shareholding transferred to Royal Mail Holdings
plc. In September 2013, Royal Mail Holdings plc changed names to Postal Services
Holding Company plc, which became Postal Services Holding Company Limited in
December 2013. In June 2017, the shareholding in POL was transferred to the

Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

F. DOCUMENT PRESERVATION

17. Historically, I understand that POL had a seven year retention policy in relation to
documents and records. In late 2014, data retention instructions were sent to
relevant parts of the business as well as a number of third parties (including
Cartwright King and Fujitsu) in contemplation of litigation. Subsequent document
preservation notices have been issued in connection with the Criminal Appeal
proceedings, malicious prosecution proceedings, the Employment Tribunal

proceedings and the Inquiry once it moved to a statutory footing.

18. In order to ensure that it continued to retain documents and other materials which
were relevant to the Group Litigation, I understand that POL arranged for copies of
the data held on its file servers (totalling approximately 9.5 TB of compressed zip
files) to be copied and placed onto a separate Network Attached Storage ("NAS")

Drive in or around 2017.

G. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS

19. Prior to 2012, I understand that POL's provider of email servers and software was
Lotus Notes. Following the Separation, POL began to use Microsoft Exchange
instead of Lotus Notes. At the same time, POL began to use an email archiving

system called Proofpoint. Since the beginning of 2016 POL has used Mimecast as

11174749700_13 6
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

its email archiving system. The emails that had previously been stored in Proofpoint

were transferred into Mimecast.

20. I understand that there are a number of limitations to the email data that POL

possesses, including:

a. Only those who were identified as being current POL employees at the time
of the Separation (i.e. those employed by POL and who continued to be
employed by POL thereafter) were transferred across to POL. Accordingly,
POL does not hold copies of email data in respect of those employees who

left the business prior to or at the time of the Separation.

b. At the time of the Proofpoint/Mimecast migration, only emails sent to or from
a postoffice.co.uk email account were migrated, despite POL employees
having access to and being able to use royalmail.com email accounts. The
consequence of this is that POL did not receive emails solely between
royalmail.com email accounts, even if those emails involved POL
employees. Furthermore, the migration from Proofpoint to Mimecast will not

have captured any deleted email data.

21. I also understand that there are a number of practical challenges associated with

searching for and exporting email data from Mimecast, including:

a. Mimecast only permits up to five active exports at a particular time. Export
results are divided into 2GB files, each of which needs to be downloaded

separately.

b. Exports only remain available in Mimecast for a period of 15 days, following

which it is necessary to re-run the underlying searches.

11174749700_13 7
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

c. The Mimecast search functionality is more limited than the search
functionality available on e-discovery platforms. Accordingly, in order to
conduct meaningful searches across emails archived on Mimecast, it would

first be necessary to export emails onto a separate e-discovery platform.

22. In view of these challenges, POL initially focused on harvesting email data for the
purpose of the Inquiry from custodians who were considered to be most likely to
hold documents relevant to a particular Rule 9 Request. That email data has then
been exported to a "Processing Database". Where it is considered that a
custodian's email data may contain documents responsive to a Rule 9 Request,
searches are then carried out over the mailbox in the Processing Database, with
documents responsive to searches then transferred to POL's "Inquiry Database"
for review (these databases are explained in further detail below). In addition, I
understand that certain email data had already been collated for certain custodians
including in the contexts of the Group Litigation and the Criminal Appeal
proceedings. Where a particular mailbox has been searched for the purposes of

responding to a Rule 9 Request, this has been identified in the Annex.

H. ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS

SharePoint, Teams and other shared drives

23. Various POL teams (including Company Secretariat, Legal and the Security teams)
have had access to and saved documents on SharePoint or Teams sites and other
shared drives. I understand that these SharePoint and Teams sites were only
introduced following the Separation, although it is possible that historical documents
may have been saved or subsequently transferred onto these drives. Where a
particular SharePoint site or shared drive has been harvested or searched for the

purposes of responding to a Rule 9 Request, this has been identified in the Annex.

POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

E-Filing Cabinets

24. Prior to the introduction of SharePoint in 2012, I understand that electronic
documents were saved in 'E-Filing Cabinets' ("EFC") within Lotus Notes. Although
an incomplete copy of the EFC is kept on the "GLO Database", POL is currently
working to determine the most complete copy of the EFC to which it has access in
order to ensure that no documents relevant to previous Rule 9 Requests have been
missed and that the most complete copy is used where necessary for future

searches.
Horizon Data

25. Transaction data (recording each transaction processed via Horizon) and event data
(recording Horizon ‘events' such as log-in attempts) is maintained by Fujitsu in
central data centres. Data is normally held for a period of seven years. However, in
October 2014, POL instructed Fujitsu to suspend its document deletion policy. I
understand that Fujitsu therefore holds transaction and event data from October

2007.
Custodian laptops

26. Data from the hard drives and laptops of certain custodians have been harvested,

including for individuals relevant in the context of the Criminal Appeal proceedings.
Contract repositories

27. In 2019, POL introduced a new web-based eProcurement platform for its employees
to manage and store their contracts on. Prior to its introduction, I understand that
third-party contracts were expected to be uploaded onto a system provided by
BravoSolution UK Limited, for which a contract was signed by POL in April 2016. I

am not aware of a central repository of contracts existing at POL prior to the Bravo

11174749700_13 9
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

system, although it is possible that historical contracts (including those legacy
contracts that POL obtained from RMG following the Separation) were uploaded to

the Bravo system when it was introduced.
Management tools and databases

28. I POLuses and has used a number of management tools and databases which may

be of relevance to the Inquiry. These include:

a. POLSAP / Core Finance: A database containing financial information and
accounting ledgers, in use since 2005. From September 2014, certain Post

Office teams transferred from POLSAP to Core Finance.

b. Credence: A management information tool providing inter alia the value,

dates and times of Horizon transactions.

c. HORice: A tool used by various POL teams (including the Security Team)

during investigations.

d. Remedy / Dynamics: Software used for logging calls made to the National
Business Support Centre in the period from 2000 — 2014 (Remedy) and 2014

— present (Dynamics).

e. iMAP: A database containing branch information used by the Network

Design and Analysis team.

f. Network Reinvention Database: A database containing the dates of service

of Post Office agents.

I HARD COPY DOCUMENTS

Postal museum

11174749700_13 10
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

29. The Postal Museum holds a range of historical POL documents, including (but not
limited to) business and administrative records covering the day-to-day running of
POL, minutes of the meetings of POL's Board which pre-date Separation and hard-
copy branch files. Certain of the documents held in the Postal Museum pre-date the

Separation, and are held by the Postal Museum on behalf of or jointly with RMG.
Oasis

30. Around 70,000 boxes and 30,000 files of archived hardcopy POL documents are
held on behalf of POL by Oasis Group ("Oasis"), an offsite storage provider. POL's
documents are primarily held at Oasis' Winchester site. These boxes comprise a
wide range of documents including (but not limited to) individual branch records, HR
records, audit files, and public consultation documents. Although the vast majority
of the boxes and files are indexed, these indices contain only high level descriptions
of the contents of the boxes and files, and I understand that a number of boxes and
files are misdescribed to a degree. POL is also aware of some branch files which
were believed to have been archived with Oasis but are in fact missing, and may

have been lost in the transfer to Oasis.

31. In addition, POL has recently indexed and scanned around 5,000 boxes and files
that were previously unindexed or not sufficiently indexed for the content to be
identifiable. POL is in the process of arranging for these to be reviewed to consider
whether any of the materials in them are of potential relevance to previous or future
Rule 9 Requests. Any identified as relevant to previous Rule 9 Requests will be
disclosed to the Inquiry. Where POL has carried out searches over the indices
and/or reviewed documents stored at Oasis for the purposes of a particular Rule 9

Request, this is set out in the Annex.

Criminal case files

POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

32. Various hard copy materials have been identified and collated as part of the reviews
undertaken in the context of the Criminal Appeal proceedings. These include Hard
copy case files consisting predominantly of ‘Green Jackets’ (investigation files of the
POL Security Team, ‘Buff’ files (POL internal prosecution files), ‘Orange’ files derived
from Royal Mail and Cartwright King and ‘Red' files (financial investigation files); as
well as various CDs, tapes and videos, which I understand consist mainly of

recordings of cautioned interviews.
Back office locations

33. During the Group Litigation and Criminal Appeal proceedings, POL identified a
number of administrative offices and sites that contain separate stores of hard copy
documents, and checked these for relevance to those proceedings. Where certain
stores contained documents that may have been relevant to those proceedings, they
were scanned and uploaded to the GLO Database and CCRC Database
respectively (explained in further detail below) for review. POL is considering
whether any of the documents that were not previously scanned may be of relevance
to the Inquiry. However, POL has been unable to locate indices of the remaining
hard copy documents stored at each site. POL is currently in the process of
determining the contents of these hard copy documents and arranging for them to
be reviewed. Any identified as relevant to previous Rule 9 Requests will be disclosed

to the Inquiry.

J. RELATIVITY DATABASES

34. The above categories and repositories of documents have to some extent been
searched and harvested previously for litigation purposes, including in the context
of the Group Litigation, the Criminal Appeals and the Employment Tribunal

proceedings, Baker and Others v Post Office Limited. A number of different

11174749700_13 12
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

databases of POL documents collated for various purposes are currently hosted on
a single Relativity platform by KPMG to allow for documents to be more easily

transferred between databases where necessary. These include:

a. The GLO Database: this contains materials collated to allow for searches
and reviews to be conducted for the purposes of disclosure in the Group
Litigation proceedings. I understand that this database was initially hosted
by Consilio on behalf of Womble Bond Dickinson, POL's original legal
advisers in respect of the Group Litigation proceedings, before being
transferred to KPMG. KPMG have carried out a number of checks and
validation steps to provide assurance that the database was successfully

transferred. The GLO Database contains in excess of 20 million documents.

b. The CCRC Database: this contains materials collated to allow for searches
and reviews to be conducted for the purposes of disclosure in the Criminal
Appeals proceedings. This database was initially hosted by Consilio on
behalf of Peters and Peters, POL's legal advisers in respect of the Criminal
Appeals proceedings. KPMG carried out a number of checks and validation
steps to provide assurance that the database was successfully transferred.

The CCRC Database contains in excess of 4 million documents.

c. The Employment Tribunal Database: this contains materials collated to allow

for searches and reviews to be conducted for the purposes of disclosure in
the Employment Tribunal proceedings. This database was initially hosted by
Consilio on behalf of Womble Bond Dickinson, one of POL's legal advisers
in respect of the Employment Tribunal proceedings, before being transferred

to KPMG. KPMG carried out a number of checks and validation steps to

11174749700_13 13
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

provide assurance that the database was successfully transferred. The

Employment Tribunal Database contains in excess of 4 million documents.

d. The HSF Database: this contains materials provided to HSF during the
course of separate instructions. It contains almost 500,000 documents,
including agendas, minutes and papers of the POL Board and sub-
committees of the Board, audit reports, emails and laptop copies of certain
custodians, and data extracted from certain SharePoint sites (including those
used by the Legal and Security teams). This database was initially hosted by

HSF before being transferred to KPMG.

e. The Processing Database: a holding database of certain email mailboxes
harvested to allow for searches to be carried out in connection with the
Inquiry. Any documents contained in the Processing Database that are
responsive to particular Inquiry-related searches are transferred to the
Inquiry Database for review. The Processing Database currently contains

over 8 million documents.

f. The Inquiry Database: this contains materials collated to allow for searches
and reviews to be conducted for the purposes of disclosure to the Inquiry.
This includes documents harvested from external sources (including data
harvested and provided by third party law firms, Oasis and the Postal
Museum) and documents identified within the other databases listed above.
POL has sought to consolidate material potentially relevant to previous Rule
9 Requests on this database to improve the efficacy and coverage of its

searches. It currently contains almost 1.5 million documents.

K. ENCRYPTION, PRIVILEGE AND REDACTIONS

35. Approximately 50,000 documents across the GLO, CCRC, Processing and Inquiry
Databases are subject to password encryption and, at present, cannot be opened.
Accordingly, the contents of such documents would not be caught by keyword
searches. POL is in the process of arranging for software to be used to attempt to
gain access to such documents. To the extent that any documents are accessed
and identified which are responsive to previous Rule 9 Requests, these will be

provided to the Inquiry.

36. When reviewing documents for disclosure to the Inquiry, redactions have been
applied to part privileged material to the extent information falls outside the
parameters of POL's approach to the waiver of privilege set out in its note dated 15

November 2021.

37. Where documents are wholly privileged, or where no information relevant to the
Inquiry remains once redactions have been applied to part privileged material, those

documents have not been disclosed.

L. CONTROL

38. POL has only searched for and disclosed those relevant documents within its
control. A large number of documents are held on POL's behalf by its former and
current advisers. POL has asked those advisers who are likely to hold documents
potentially relevant to the Inquiry's terms of reference on behalf of POL to provide
copies of these documents to POL. Where documents have been obtained from an
adviser for the purposes of responding to a particular Rule 9 Request, this is set out

in the Annex.

39. I There are documents in the categories listed below that are no longer in POL's

control:

11174749700_13 15
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

a. Original and copy correspondence, memoranda and other documents which
have been lost or destroyed in the ordinary course of business which cannot

now be traced or recovered.

b. Any pre-Separation materials that were not transferred to POL during the

Separation.

M. REASONABLENESS OF SEARCHES.

40. To the best of my knowledge and belief, the searches and reviews that POL has
conducted (or its advisers have conducted on its behalf) to locate and provide the
Inquiry with the information that it has requested in each of its Rule 9 Requests to

date have been reasonable in all the circumstances.

Statement of truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.

ANNEX TO INTERIM DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

1. INTRODUCTION

14 The purpose of this Annex is to provide an overview of the steps that POL has taken to
identify and produce to the Inquiry documents responsive to the requests made by the Inquiry
when on a non-statutory footing and each of the eleven Rule 9 Requests issued by the
Inquiry to date, and a description of the documents that have been produced in response to
each request.

1.2 A detailed description of the approach that POL has adopted in responding to the Inquiry's
requests is set out in the following paragraphs.

2. RULE 9 REQuest No. 1 (17 AuGusT 2021) — HSS WITNESS STATEMENT

24 By its Request No. 1, the Inquiry requested that POL produce a witness statement providing
various information in relation to the Historic Shortfall Scheme (the "HSS").

2.2 POL produced a witness statement (provided by Nick Read) in response to this request on
31 August 2021. No additional / supporting documents were requested by (or produced to)
the Inquiry.

3. RULE 9 REQUEST NO. 2 (9 SEPTEMBER 2021) — RE-DISCLOSURE OF DOCUMENTS
3.1 By its Request No. 2, the Inquiry sought, amongst other things, the provision of:

3.1.1 unredacted copies of all documents which POL had previously provided to the
Inquiry in redacted form prior to its conversion onto a statutory footing (request 2).

3.1.2 all documents listed in POL's Artefact Register, to the extent that these documents
have not already been produced to the Inquiry (request 3).

3.2 Prior to its conversion onto a statutory footing, POL arranged for a total of 441 documents to
be produced to the Inquiry. 396 of these documents were produced by POL in response to
five separate "Batch Information Requests" received from the Inquiry, broken down as
follows:

3.2.1 Batch Request 1 (23 October 2020): 275 documents.
3.2.2 Batch Request 2 (20 November 2020): 15 documents
3.2.3 Batch Request 3 (18 December 2020): 26 documents
3.2.4 Batch Request 4 (29 January 2021): 4 documents
3.2.5 Batch Request 5 (26 March 2021): 66 documents
3.2.6 Batch Request 6 (11 June 2021): 10 documents

3.3 POL arranged for a further 11 documents to be produced to the Inquiry in response to the
Call for Evidence on 23 February 2021. A further 34 documents were produced to the Inquiry
in connection with the "Teach-In" sessions held on 29 April 2021.

3.4 In its initial response to Request No. 2 on 30 September 2021, POL produced to the Inquiry:

11174749700_13 18
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

3.4.1 unredacted copies of all documents that had previously been provided in redacted
form, save for certain documents for which it considered third party consent would
first be required.

3.4.2 all documents included in the Artefact Register to the extent that these had not
previously been provided to the Inquiry, save for certain documents in respect of
which it considered third party consent would first be required.

3.5 On 29 October 2021, having obtained the third party consents referred to in paragraph 3.4.1
above, POL produced to the Inquiry copies of the documents that had been withheld from
the production on 30 September 2021.

3.6 Certain of the documents contained material that was subject to legal professional privilege
and had accordingly been produced to the Inquiry in redacted form.

4. RULE 9 REQuEsT No. 3 (8 OCTOBER 2021) — GLO TRIAL BUNDLE AND DISCLOSURE LISTS IN
HAMILTON PROCEEDINGS

44 By its Request No. 3, the Inquiry sought production of the following documents:

4.1.1 The full electronic trial bundle in Bates and Ors v Post Office Limited (Case No.
HQ16X01238, hearing dates: 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22 and 26 November
2018; 3, 4, 5, and 6 December 2018) (the "Common Issues Trial Bundle");

4.1.2 The full electronic trial bundle in Bates and Ors v Post Office Limited (Case No.
HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 and HQ17X04248, hearing dates: 11, 12, 13, 14,
18, 19, 20, 21 and 27 March 2019; 3, 9 and 23 April 2019; 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13 and
14 June 2019; and 2 July 2019) (the "Horizon Issues Trial Bundle");

4.1.3 A full list of disclosure provided by POL in Bates and Ors v Post Office Limited
group litigation (the "Group Litigation"); and

4.1.4 A full list of disclosure provided by POL in R v Hamilton and Ors [2019] EWCA
Crim 21 and [2019] EWCA Crim 577.

4.2 On 29 October 2021, POL produced to the Inquiry documents responsive to the request,
together with a copy of the production index.

43 POL obtained copies of the Common Issues and Horizon Issues Trial Bundles from Opus 2
International Limited, who provided e-Discovery services in the context of the Group
Litigation and who continue to maintain electronic copies of the bundles.

44 POL obtained a list of the disclosure provided by POL in the Group Litigation from Womble
Bond Dickinson ("WBD"), who represent POL in those proceedings. As explained in HSF's
letters of 18 and 29 October 2021, POL's disclosure in the Group Litigation was provided in
multiple stages and the list provided to the Inquiry was a composite list covering all of the
stages.

45 POL obtained a list of the disclosure provided by POL in the Hamilton proceedings from the
firm of solicitors which acted for POL in those proceedings, Peters & Peters.

TO HORIZON

5.1 By its Request No. 4, the Inquiry sought production of all board minutes since 2000 which
relate to the Horizon IT systems, including those which address any of the following matters:

5.1.1 issues relating to and arising from bugs, errors and defects;

5.1.2 the impact of the Horizon IT system on sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses;
and

5.1.3 the bringing of private prosecutions.

5.2 By its letter of 26 November 2021, the Inquiry confirmed that it considered sub-committee
minutes to be within the scope of Request 4 and requested that POL therefore search for
and provide responsive materials by no later than 3 January 2021.

Board Minutes

5.3 In order to respond to the request, POL sought to collate all minutes of the Post Office board
in the period from 1 January 2000 to date. In this respect:

5.3.1 Minutes from 2012 onwards were obtained from POL's Company Secretary from
the Company Secretary SharePoint.

5.3.2 Pre-2012 minutes were previously obtained from the Postal Museum in the course
of separate instructions that POL had provided to HSF (including, in respect of the
period before regular meetings of the POL Board took place, the board minutes of
the Statutory Corporation and Consignia Plc). In order to identify minutes of the
dedicated POL Board (which started to meet regularly from May 2002), POL
conducted searches across these materials for documents responsive to the
following search: "POLB" AND "Minutes of the meeting" AND ("Post Office Limited"
OR "Post Office Ltd"). POL also sought the assistance of the Postal Museum to
ensure that it had as comprehensive a set of minutes as possible (which helped
identify two further minutes).

54 Having identified and collated a universe of board minutes for the relevant period, POL then
conducted keyword searches using the following terms to identify a narrower pool of
potentially responsive documents for manual review:

5.5 The POL Board met regularly from May 2002. In respect of the period from 2000 to 2002, at
the request of the Inquiry in its letter of 26 November 2021, POL obtained the consent of
RMG to produce minutes of the boards of Post Office Statutory Corporation and Consignia
Pic to the Inquiry.

56 On 1 December 2021, POL produced to the Inquiry Board minutes responsive to Request 4,
together with a copy of the production index. In total, POL disclosed 151 board minutes in
response to this Request 4, including relevant minutes of the Post Office (Statutory
Corporation) and Consignia PLC boards.

Sub-Committee Minutes
57 Sparrow and GLO Sub-committee minutes

5.7.1 POL has maintained complete sets of minutes of the Sparrow and GLO sub-
committees, which are held by the POL Company Secretary. The Sparrow and
GLO sub-committee minutes were manually reviewed in full and those minutes that
are responsive to the request were produced to the Inquiry on 17 December 2021.

5.8 Other sub-committees listed in the Annex to HSF's 23 November letter

5.8.1 The Annex to HSF's letter of 23 November 2021 identified the following, additional
sub-committees:

(A) Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (formerly, the Risk and
Compliance Committee)

(B) Health and Safety Committee
(C) Nominations Committee

The GLO and CCRC databases were also searched for "POLARC" (a unique
reference which appears in each of the minutes of the meetings of the ARC Sub-
Committee). However, no additional ARC minutes were identified.

POL then conducted keyword searches using the following terms to identify a

5.9 Pre-2012 minutes

5.9.1 Prior to 2012, POL does not appear to have had an Audit, Risk and Compliance
Committee. POL did however have a Risk and Compliance Committee ("RCC"),
which appears to have been a board sub-committee. Searches for pre-2012 RCC
meetings were first carried out on HSF's Relativity platform, with the following
search terms: "Risk and Compliance Committee" AND "Meeting Ref".

5.9.2 POL also wrote to the Postal Museum to ask for assistance with identifying pre-
2012 minutes of the Committees listed above. In its response, the Postal Museum
indicated that it held a small number of copies of Health & Safety Committee
minutes from around 2000 and some Pensions Committee minutes in hard copy.
The Postal Museum indicated that copies of these minutes were not available and
that they would have to be inspected in person. By that stage it had become
apparent that none of the minutes of the Health & Safety Committee and Pensions
Committee that had been located on the Company Secretary SharePoint were
responsive to the request. It was therefore decided not to inspect the Health &
Safety and Pensions Committee minutes held at the Postal Museum on the basis
that they were unlikely relevant. The Postal Museum did not hold any additional
RCC minutes.

5.9.3 In order to identify sub-committee minutes of the Post Office Statutory Corporation
and Consignia Pic for the period from 2000 to May 2002, POL conducted a targeted
search for the term "minutes" across the unified document title HSF's Relativity
platform, with a date filter of 01/01/2000 — 24/05/2002 (the date of the first regular
POL board meeting). Responsive documents were reviewed for relevance. POL
then used text common to each of the minutes identified to try to identify further
Post Office Audit Committee and Consignia Holdings Pic Audit and Risk Committee
minutes. Searches were conducted for "Post Office Audit Committee" across the
HSF, GLO and CCRC databases but no additional minutes were located. POL
conducted a further search for "audit and risk committee" AND "Consignia Holdings
plc" across the HSF, GLO and CCRC databases but, again, these searches did

11174749700_13 23
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

not identify any further minutes.
5.10 Board strategy sessions

5.10.1. In the course of responding to this request, POL obtained from the Company
Secretary handwritten notes and action lists of the board's annual strategy
sessions between 2012-2018. Whilst these are not (strictly speaking) Board or
Sub-Committee minutes, POL nonetheless arranged for these materials to be
reviewed for relevance in the absence of formal minutes for these meetings.

5.11. On 22 December 2021, POL produced to the Inquiry 53 relevant sub-committee minutes,
together with a production list identifying the documents that had been provided. Specifically,
POL produced:

5.11.1 39 post-2012 minutes of the Audit Risk and Compliance Committee;
5.11.2 7 pre-2012 minutes of the Risk and Compliance Committee;

5.11.3 1 Post Office (statutory corporation) Audit Committee minutes;
5.11.4 3 minutes of the Remuneration Committee;

5.11.5 1 Annual & Interim Reports Committee minutes; and

5.11.6 2 board strategy session draft minutes.

6. RULE 9 REQUEST No. 5 (26 NOVEMBER 2021) — LEGAL ADVICE

6.1 By Rule 9 Request No. 5, the Inquiry sought the production of various documents / categories
of documents by no later than 17 December 2021. A list of these documents / categories of
documents are set out in Schedule I. In response to this request, POL took the following
steps.

6.2 Document Retention and Disclosure Failures (Requests 1 and 2)

6.2.1 POL located and produced to the Inquiry copies of the advices of Simon Clarke
(the "Clarke Advices") dated 8 July 2013, 15 July 2013, 19 July 2013 and 2 August
2013.

6.2.2 In order to identify materials responsive to Request 2, the following searches were
conducted over the general advice files of Cartwright King and previously
harvested extracts from the mailboxes of the certain former POL employees,
namely Jarnail Singh, Susan Crichton and Alwen Lyons, each of whom appear to
have been centrally involved in communicating with Cartwright King:

(A) Search 1: All emails sent to/from POL domains to/from Cartwright King
domains in the period from 1 July 2013 to 31 August 2013.

(B) Search 2: All emails sent to/from POL domains to/from Cartwright King
domains during the course of 2013, which are responsive to any of the
following search terms: "Disclosure" or "Expert Evidence" or "Fujitsu" or
"Horizon".

(C) Search 3: All emails sent to/from POL domains to/from Cartwright King

11174749700_13 24
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement

domains, which are responsive to the following search: "Simon" or "Clarke"
wi20 "Advice" or "Advise" or "Opinion" or "Opine".

(D) Search 4: "Simon" or "Clarke" AND "July 2013" or "August 2013".

6.2.3 On 17 December 2021, POL produced to the Inquiry 26 documents in response to
requests 1 and 2, together with a production list. This comprised the four Clarke
Advices described at paragraph 6.2.1 above in response to Request 1, and 23
documents responsive to Request 2.

6.2.4 HSF's letter of 17 December 2021 recorded that POL had been unable to locate
copies of certain documents in response to Request 2, including copies of the
instructions that were prepared in relation to the Clarke Advices and that it
proposed to continue to review potentially relevant materials and conduct further
targeted searches with a view to producing any other responsive documents to the
Inquiry by 14 January 2022. In particular, POL arranged for Search 1 and Search
3 to be conducted across the entire mailboxes of Susan Crichton and Rodric
Williams (with a start date for Search 1 of 1 June 2013 (rather than 1 July 2013)),
with all responsive documents subject to manual review. As explained in HSF's
letter of 14 January 2022, these searches did not reveal any further responsive
documents.

6.3 Post-Conviction Review and Disclosure (Requests 3 and 4)

6.3.1 Peters & Peters have previously collated advices that had been prepared by Brian
Altman QC in the period from 2013 to 2016, and instructions in relation to the same.
These include the following documents, copies of which POL produced to the
Inquiry on 17 December 2021 in response to Requests 3 and 4:

(A) Mr Altman QC's observations on the Original Terms of Reference dated 2
August 2013;'

(B) Mr Altman QC's Interim Review dated 2 August 2013;

(C) A note of the conference held with Mr Altman QC on 9 September 2013;
(D) The Amended Terms of Reference in respect of the Prosecution Review;
(E) The General Review dated 15 October 2013; and

(F) The Review of Post Office Ltd Prosecution Role dated 19 December 2013.

6.3.2 HSF's letter of 17 December 2021 explained that POL had not been able to locate
final versions of (i) the Original Terms of Reference and (ii) the Amended Terms of

‘ As explained in HSF's letter of 17 December 2021, Mr Altman QC was initially instructed by POL to advise
and conduct two separate reviews (as reflected in the Original Terms of Reference): (i) a backward-facing
review of the processes and strategies adopted by Cartwright King and POL (the "Process Review"); and
(ii) a review of POL's role as a prosecutor (the "Prosecution Review"). Following discussions between POL
and Mr Altman QC, and observations that he made on the Original Terms of Reference, it appears that
Amended Terms of Reference were prepared and circulated. Whereas the Original Terms of Reference
had included both of the anticipated reviews, the Amended Terms of Reference were divided into two
separate documents, one for the Process Review and the other for the Prosecution Review. The "General
Review" dated 15 October 2013 set out Mr Altman QC's advice in relation to the Process Review and the

11174749700_13 25
POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

Interim Disclosure Statement
27 May 2022

Reference for the Process Review. However, the text of these Terms of Reference
appears to be quoted in Mr Altman QC's Observations on the Original Terms of
Reference dated 2 August 2013 and the General Review dated 15 October 2013
respectively, copies of which were produced to the Inquiry.

6.3.3 Mr Altman QC's advice of 19 December 2013 refers to three separate conferences
/ teleconferences, held on 9 September 2013, 4 October 2013 and 17 October
2013. HSF's letter of 17 December 2021 recorded that POL had located (and
produced to the Inquiry) a note prepared in relation to the 9 September conference
and that POL proposed to continue to review potentially relevant materials and
conduct further targeted searches with a view to identifying any notes that were
prepared in relation to the 4 October and 17 October teleconferences. The
supplemental searches conducted by POL are set out below, each of which were
conducted across the mailboxes of Rodric Williams and Susan Crichton. As
recorded in HSF's letter of 14 January 2022, these searches did not identify any
additional relevant documents. It is conceivable that notes of these teleconferences
were not prepared and/or shared with POL.

(A) Search A: Documents responsive to the following search terms, in the
period from 1 October 2013 to 31 October 2013: "Altman" and
"Conference" or "Note" or "Call" or "4 October" or "4th October".

(B) Search B: Documents responsive to the following search terms, in the
period from 1 October 2013 to 31 October 2013: "Altman" and
"Conference" or "Note" or "Call" or"17 October" or "17th October".

6.4 Second Sight Advice (Request 5)

6.4.1 In order to identify potentially responsive materials, POL initially conducted a
manual review of certain emails and advices in the possession of POL, WBD and
HSF. Documents identified through this exercise were then subject to a manual
review to confirm their responsiveness to Request 5 and, as explained in POL's
letter to the Inquiry of that date, were produced to the Inquiry as appropriate on 17
December 2021.

Targeted Searches

6.4.2 As explained in HSF's letter to the Inquiry dated 14 January 2022, POL focused its
searches in the time available on the repositories most likely to hold responsive
documents. Following the initial production of documents in response to Request
5 on 17 December 2021 referred to above, POL conducted targeted electronic
searches over a broader range of documents in order to identify responsive
material, which are explained below. In parallel, potentially responsive documents
provided by Linklaters were manually reviewed and also produced to the Inquiry
as appropriate on 14 January 2022.

6.4.3 Documents that were responsive to the searches outlined below were manually
reviewed to assess their responsiveness to the request. POL then produced those

6.4.4 Following this production, as HSF explained in a letter to the Inquiry dated 5 April
2022, it became apparent that, due to a technical issue with the documents that
were provided by WBD to KPMG (POL's e-Discovery provider), the date range
searches that were carried out in relation to Second Sight materials did not provide
accurate results with regard to a certain type of data. This issue has since been
resolved and the search terms that POL initially applied in respect of Second Sight
(set out in Search 1 above) were re-run. POL is in a position to produce additional
responsive documents to the Inquiry once it has been provided with a Quatrix link.

(including WBD and Norton Rose Fulbright ("NRF")), and (ii) conducting targeted
searches across various repositories and manually reviewing responsive results.

Potentially responsive materials

6.5.2 In order to produce a list of potentially responsive materials, a manual review was
conducted of documents and emails: (a) provided by POL to HSF from the time of
HSF's engagement by POL in 2019 in relation to the GLO; (b) in relation to legal
advices provided by HSF to POL; (c) provided by NRF in relation to its involvement
in the GLO; and (d) identified by WBD as potentially responsive to Request 6
following WBD's own manual review. Manual reviews of these documents were
then conducted to determine which particular documents were responsive to
Request 6. In addition to the above, POL conducted a review of:

(A) Papers that were prepared for regular meetings of a Steering Committee
("SteerCo") that was established by POL in 2016 to co-ordinate its
approach and response to the Group Litigation.

(B) The minutes of SteerCo (or similar) meetings in 2019 identified and
provided by POL to HSF.

(C) Papers that were prepared for the sub-committee of POL's board (the
"GLO board sub-committee") that was established by POL in around
March 2018 in order for the Board to receive legal advice in relation to
POL's defence of the Group Litigation and held regular meetings from 26
March 2018 to 10 December 2019.

(D) The minutes of the GLO board sub-committee identified and provided by
POL to HSF.

(E) Papers that were prepared for POL's board in relation to the conduct of
POL's defence of the Group Litigation identified and provided by POL to
HSF; and

(F) Proofs of evidence and notes from witness proofing meetings in relation to
the Common Issues trial and Horizon Issues trial, identified and provided
to POL by WBD.

Targeted Searches

6.5.3 Following the initial production of documents in response to Request 6, POL
conducted targeted electronic searches over a broader range of documents —
principally documents held by WBD - in order to identify responsive material. A
summary of these searches is set out below, including a description of the search
terms that were applied and the repositories across which these searches were
applied.

6.5.4 Documents that were responsive to the searches outlined below were manually
reviewed to assess their responsiveness to the request. POL then produced those
documents that were responsive to the request and also any non-responsive family
documents.

request of 28 February 2022, POL identified an email from Rodric Williams which
POL considered to be responsive to Request 6. POL produced the email to the
Inquiry. In view of that email, POL conducted a targeted review of email
correspondence between Mr Williams and WBD to identify any further documents
that may be responsive to Request 6.° POL is in a position to produce these
additional responsive documents to the Inquiry once it has been provided with a
Quatrix link.

6.5.6 Across the various productions that include documents responsive to this request,
POL has produced a total of 4,298 documents.

6.5.7 As explained in HSF's letter to the Inquiry dated 14 January 2022, in order to
identify documents responsive to this request, POL sought to focus its searches in
the time available on the repositories most likely to hold responsive documents.
POL noted that whilst further searches could theoretically have been carried out to
identify other potentially responsive documents, it appeared to POL that any such
documents may only have limited probative value.

6.6 Board Minutes (Request 7)

6.6.1 POL had already responded to this aspect of the Rule 9 Request (as part of its
response to the Request No. 4). Accordingly, no further action was taken in respect
of this Request 7.

7. RULE 9 REQUEST NO. 6 (3 DECEMBER 2021) — INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS CONCERNING
PROSECUTIONS

71 By its Request No. 6, the Inquiry requested that POL provide the following explanation and
documents by no later than 17 December 2021:

7.14 Prosecution Statistics: Confirmation of the number of prosecutions that POL
brought (in total) between 2000 and 2015 and the number of those prosecutions
that resulted in a conviction.

7.1.2 Prosecution Files: All of POL's prosecution files relating to any conviction (of an
SPM, assistant or employee) which took place in the years 2001 and 2011.

7.2 POL's response to the Inquiry's request for "Prosecution Statistics" was provided on 15
December 2021, with the requested "Prosecution Files" produced on 17 December 2021. As
explained in HSF's letter of 15 December 2021, POL adopted the following approach in
identifying these materials and producing the requested information to the Inquiry.

7.3 Prosecution Statistics

7.3.1 The information provided by POL in its letter of 15 December 2021 related to
private prosecutions brought by POL (or, pre-separation, RMG), and which were
brought (entirely or in part) on the basis of evidence from the Horizon IT system. It

did not include cases brought in Northern Ireland or Scotland, on the basis that
such cases were conducted by public authorities.

7.3.2 The principal source of information relied upon to produce this information was
contemporaneous casework spreadsheets that were manually created and
maintained at the time of the investigations / prosecutions by the POL Security
Team. In the course of collating and analysing this information, Peters & Peters
identified instances of incomplete, incorrect or inconsistent data, some of which
they were unable to reconcile. Where Peters & Peters were unable to verify
information, it was assumed that the prosecutions fell within the Post-Conviction
Disclosure Exercise ("PCDE"). Peters & Peters confirmed that to date they have
not identified any prosecutions that were within scope of the PCDE and which had
not been reflected in the casework spreadsheets.

74 Prosecution Case Files

7.41 POL produced to the Inquiry documents located in each of the following document
repositories, to the extent that these documents had been identified by Peters &
Peters as part of the PCDE as relating to any individuals who were convicted in
2001 or 2011:

(A) The electronic Security team SharePoint system;
(B) The hard copy Security team folders;

(C) The hard copy RMG 'Buff Files', which were created and maintained by
RMG's criminal law team (and, post-separation, by POL's criminal law
team);

(D) The defence case files, consisting of documents identified for disclosure to
convicted individuals by Peters & Peters as part of the PCDE; and

(E) Disclosable to Appellant, consisting of documents identified by Peters &
Peters as meeting the test for disclosure to a convicted individual under
the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act.

75 POL has produced a total of 14,586 documents (29 documents in relation to convictions
secured in 2001, and 14,557 documents in relation to convictions secured in 2011). As
explained in HSF's letter of 15 December 2021, only very limited materials were available in
respect of convictions secured in 2001, in part as a result of the application of a ‘business as
usual’ document retention policies, under which POL/RMG would destroy documents after
six years.

8. RULE 9 REQuEST No. 7 (13 DECEMBER 2021) — HORIZON ROLL-OuT MATERIALS

8.1 By its Request No. 7, the Inquiry requested that POL produce to the Inquiry by 29 December
2021:

Report of September 1999;

8.1.2 minutes of the Horizon Working Group; and

8.1.3 reports of the Horizon Working Group.

8.2 In an effort to locate documents responsive to this request, POL (i) conducted targeted
searches for relevant electronic documents and (ii) reviewed hard copy materials held at the
Postal Museum and Oasis archives.

8.3 Initial searches were carried out for the specific documents sought by running appropriate
key word searches over the electronic documents held in Relativity. In particular, POL
conducted the following searches across each of the HSF, GLO and CCRC Databases. As
explained in HSF's letter of 23 December 2021, these searches did not identify any
responsive documents.

8.3.1 Search 1: Documents responsive to the following search terms, in the period from
4 January 1997 — 1 January 1999:

(B) ("Horizon Working Group" or "HWG*" or ("Horizon" AND "Working Group"))
AND "Cabinet Office" AND ("December 1999" OR "1999").

8.4 POL also searched hard copy documents held at the Oasis archives in Winchester and the
Postal Museum for responsiveness to this request. These searches were undertaken at the
same time as searches for the documents requested by the Inquiry under Request No. 9,
and full details are set out below at paragraph 10 below.*

8.5 Files that were identified during onsite hard copy reviews as being potentially responsive to
Request No. 7 were scanned and uploaded to Relativity and each document contained within
those files was then manually reviewed.

8.6 POL provided the responsive documents to the Inquiry on 11 February 2022. This comprised
copies of the (three) individual Reports sought, and a number of documents relating to the
Horizon Working Group. In total, nine documents were produced to the Inquiry in response
to this request.

87 It is possible that further documents may be located in other hard copy repositories which
are being searched. However, this is uncertain due to the date of creation of the documents
requested. Applying POL's seven-year retention of documents policy, and even assuming
that the documents would have been within scope of the litigation stop notice issued in 2014,
many of the documents which existed in hard copy from this period are likely to have been
lost or destroyed in the usual course of business prior to the notice being issued.
Furthermore, in as far as the documents requested were ever held electronically, then it is
unlikely that they were migrated to POL following its separation from RMG in 2012 as many
employees who had been involved in creating and handling these documents were likely to
have left POL's employment and therefore not be caught in the harvesting of POL documents
described in the main body of this statement.

9. RULE 9 REQUEST No. 8 (17 DECEMBER 2021) — TEACH-IN WITNESS STATEMENTS.

9.1 By its Request No. 8, the Inquiry requested (i) draft witness statements, and (ii) any related
documents, from the appropriate persons within POL in relation to a series of teach-in
sessions with POL employees held between April and June 2021, prior to the conversion of
the Inquiry into a statutory Inquiry from 1 June 2021.

9.2 In particular, the Request sought "the same or similar information that was received" during
the teach-in sessions and set out a series of 53 more specific requests for information to be
covered by the witness statements requested. The Request also sought copies of all
documents in POL's possession that were referred to during, or otherwise provided in relation
to, the teach-in sessions.

9.3 POL identified three individuals who were able to provide the witness statements requested.
As part of the preparation of these witness statements, POL sought to identify, and exhibit

4 Request No. 9 and Request No. 7 had multiple common factors. Both requests focused on the earliest
documents relevant to the Horizon IT system, dating back to 1994, Further, both requests sought a
combination of specific documents and classes or types of documents.

to each witness statement, any documents that were relevant to the issues covered by that
statement.

9.4 POL had maintained a record of the documents provided to the Inquiry as part of the teach-
in sessions and subsequently in response to the Inquiry's Batch 6 information request (issued
prior to its conversion to a statutory Inquiry) regarding additional materials referenced during
the sessions. Using this record, POL was able to identify the responsive documents. For
other documents, POL conducted targeted searches.

9.5 POL provided the draft witness statements requested to the Inquiry by way of email on 8
February 2022. On the same day, POL also produced exhibits to these statements, together
with documents responsive to Part 54 of the Request, which together represented 128
documents.

10. RULE 9 REQuEsT No. 9 (17 DECEMBER 2021) — FURTHER HORIZON ROLL-OuT MATERIALS

10.1 By its Request No. 9, the Inquiry sought specific documents and certain broader categories
of documents relating to the adoption and design of the Horizon IT system, and also the pilot
and roll-out of the system. Responsive documents were identified by a manual review of
hard-copy documents stored at the Oasis archives in Winchester and the Postal Museum,
as well as by targeted searches for electronic documents.

Oasis archive (Winchester)

10.2 The Oasis archive comprises over 70,000 boxes and some 30,000 files. These boxes and
files consist of a wide range of documents including (but not limited to) individual branch
records, HR records, audit files, public consultation documents, and the working papers of
individuals. Descriptions of the majority of these boxes and files are set out in two indices
(the "Oasis indices"), one for boxes and one for files. There were also many boxes and files
— be around 5,000 — which were unindexed. POL has recently indexed and scanned these
files and boxes and is in the process of arranging for these to be manually reviewed. Any
documents identified as relevant to this or other Rule 9 requests will be disclosed to the
Inquiry.

10.3. POL conducted keyword searches across the Oasis indices in order to identify files and
boxes which appeared from their descriptions to contain potentially responsive material to
Request No. 7 and Request No. 9. These include the following: "Horizon"; or "ICL"; or
"Pathway", or "CAPS"; or "Treasury"; or "Consulting"; or “Corbett'; or "Montague"; or
"Roberts" or "Johnson" or "DSS" or "Benefit' or "Benefits" or "DTI" or "Select" or "Cabinet’
or "HWG" or “Working Group" or "Payment" or "Consultancy".

10.4 The descriptions of the boxes and files that were responsive to these search terms, as well
as the dates on which they were archived, were considered on a line-by-line basis to filter
out any that appeared on manual review to be irrelevant. Where there was uncertainty as to
whether a particular file or box was likely to be relevant, POL erred on the side of inclusion,
so as to minimise the risk of responsive documents being missed. A further manual review
of the indices was then undertaken to identify any additional files or boxes whose
descriptions in the indices were not responsive to keyword searches but which had been
archived by particular individuals, or which appeared from their names to relate to projects

which could have related to Horizon.°
10.5 These searches produced lists of:
10.5.1 18 files that were reviewed for relevance to Request No. 7; and

10.5.2 In excess of 480 files (across approximately 125 boxes) that were reviewed for
relevance to Request No. 9.

10.6 Any files which were identified as containing responsive material were scanned and
uploaded to Relativity, and subject to a manual review.

Postal Museum

10.7 POL provided a list of documents (described in the same terms as in the relevant requests)
to the archivists at the Postal Museum. The archivists then undertook searches of the
materials that they hold based on keyword searches that they believed were most likely to
identify the material. POL then attended the Postal Museum in January 2022 to review in
hard copy the files and documents which were responsive to the archivists' searches and
which POL considered may be relevant to the requests.

10.8 Once relevant files had been identified, document processing specialists attended in January
and February 2022 to undertake on-site scanning, as removal of the documents from the
Postal Museum is not permitted. The documents were then uploaded to Relativity and
manually reviewed, and the documents that were responsive to the requests were provided
to the Inquiry.

Electronic documents

10.9 POL also conducted searches across the electronic documents held in Relativity (in
particular, over documents hosted on the GLO Database), save that where copies of specific
documents requested in the Request No. 9 had already been located in the hard copy
repositories, no further searches were undertaken.

10.10 POL used iterative searches to locate documents in response to each item requested under
Request No. 9, refining the searches depending on information gathered from previous
searches, such as likely date ranges, relevant names of authors or recipients, document
titles, terms or footer references. Where categories of document were sought, rather than
individual documents, a similar approach was adopted searching for the particular category
of documents. A full list of keyword searches is set out below.

10.11 Documents responsive to targeted searches across the GLO Database were reviewed and,
to the extent responsive, were produced to the Inquiry. As part of this review, a number of
documents were identified as responsive but subject to joint legal privilege held by POL and
other entities such as Fujitsu, the Department of Work and Pensions, HM Treasury and BEIS.
These documents were therefore withheld from production until POL had obtained the

6 For example, POL considered on a line-by-line basis the descriptions of each of the files which had been
archived by the Horizon Director, the Horizon Commercial Manager, the Horizon Change Control Manager
and certain secretarial / support staff who appeared to have filed materials relating to Horizon around the
time of the roll-out.

Productions

10.12 An initial set of responsive documents was produced to the Inquiry on 11 February 2022,
with supplemental productions on 18 February 2022 (relating to requests 15 — 19 and 24), 4
March 2022 (Fujitsu joint privilege documents), 8 April 2022 (BEIS and DWP documents)
and 5 May 2022 (Treasury documents). Further responsive documents were also produced
on 6 May 2022.

10.13 Across the various productions that include documents responsive to this request, POL
produced a total of 1,033 documents.

10.14 It is possible that further documents may be located in other hard copy repositories which
are being searched. However, this is uncertain due to the date of creation of the documents

11174749700_13 44

requested. Applying POL's seven-year retention of documents policy, and even assuming
that the documents would have been within scope of the litigation stop notice issued in 2014,
many of the documents which existed in hard copy from this period are likely to have been
lost or destroyed in the usual course of business prior to the notice being issued.
Furthermore, in as far as the documents requested were ever held electronically, then it is
unlikely that they were migrated to POL following its separation from RMG in 2012 as many
employees who had been involved in creating and handling these documents were likely to
have left POL's employment and therefore not be caught in the harvesting of POL documents.
described in the main body of this statement.

11. RULE 9 REQUEST No. 10 (18 FEBRUARY 2022) — DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELEVANT TO
PHASES 2 AND 3

11.1 By its Request No. 10, the Inquiry sought various documents and information relevant to
Phases 2 and 3 of the Inquiry's proceedings. In particular, the Inquiry sought documents /
information under the following headings / themes:

11.1.1. Horizon Implementation (Requests 1 to 4);

11.1.2 Modifications (Requests 5 to 11);

11.1.3 Training (Requests 12 to 15);

11.1.4 Advice and Assistance (Requests 16 to 20);

11.1.5 Resolving Disputes (Requests 21 to 24);

11.1.6 Recording, Reporting and Fixing Bugs, Errors and Defects (Requests 25 to 26);
11.1.7 Privileged Access Rights (Requests 27 to 28); and

11.1.8 I Assurance (Request 29).

11.2 The Inquiry requested that POL provide a response in respect of Requests 1 - 4 and
Requests 25 — 29 by 18 March 2022, with a response due in respect of the balance of the
requests by 15 April 2022.

Requests with a deadline of 18 March 2022

11.3. POL sought to identify documents responsive to this request by a combination of (i) reviewing
known documents (including liaising with Peters & Peters and WBD in relation to the same)
with a view to identifying an initial list of potentially responsive materials and (ii) devising and
conducting targeted searches across various repositories and manually reviewing
documents that were responsive to those searches.

11.4 In order to identify an initial list of potentially responsive materials, and on the basis that the
issues captured by the Request No. 10 were also the subject of disclosure in the Group
Litigation, POL reviewed each of the Horizon Issues and Common Issues Trial Bundles, as
well as each of the witness statements and expert reports prepared in those proceedings,
both to identify whether the documents were responsive and should be disclosed to the
Inquiry and to identify further materials of potential relevance referred to within those

documents. POL has produced to the Inquiry all relevant documents identified through this
process.

11.5 A summary of the targeted searches that POL has conducted to identify documents
responsive to Requests 1 — 4 and Requests 25 — 29 is set out below, in each case including
a description of the keyword search terms that were applied and the repositories across
which these searches were conducted. In large part, due the specific nature of the requests
and challenges with identifying individuals at POL who would be likely to hold key responsive
materials, the searches were conducted over the entirety of or significant portions of the
GLO, CCRC and Inquiry Workspaces, rather than being focused on the mailboxes of specific
individuals. All documents that were responsive to these searches were then manually
reviewed and, where relevant, produced to the Inquiry (subject to privilege).

11.6 Certain of the documents contained material that was subject to legal professional privilege
and had accordingly been produced to the Inquiry in redacted form.

arranged for all of the materials that were harvested from each of Lesley Sewell, Mike Young and Rob
Houghton (all former POL Chief Information Officers) in the context of the GLO to be collated and then
arranged for the above search to be conducted across these materials only (rather than the entirety of the
GLO Database).

harvested a number of documents for which Mr Perkins was the custodian. For completeness, POL has
arranged for this Request 29 — Search 6 to be conducted across these materials.

Supplemental Reviews

11.7 Following production to the Inquiry on 18 March 2022, POL conducted the following further
search and review exercises in respect of this request.

11.7.1. Postal Museum and Oasis documents: As explained in HSF's letter of 18 March
2022, further searches were conducted at the Oasis and Postal Museum archives,
which POL considered may hold documents relevant to this request. Documents
that were identified as being potentially responsive from a review of and searches
across the relevant indices were scanned and uploaded to Relativity.

11.7.2 For the avoidance of doubt, POL conducted a full manual review of each of the
documents recently collated from the Oasis archives and uploaded onto Relativity
for responsiveness to Request No. 10. To the extent that any of the searches listed
in the above table were conducted over documents collated from the Postal
Museum archives prior to these supplemental materials being uploaded to
Relativity, these searches have been repeated over the more comprehensive set
of Postal Museum documents. All documents that were responsive to the search
terms were manually reviewed, and documents identified as responsive were
produced to the Inquiry.

11.7.3 Technology Assisted Review: In HSF's letter of 18 March 2022, POL explained
that it was considering deploying Technology / Computer Assisted Review in order
to identify any further documents that were responsive to this request (and, in
particular, documents responsive to Requests 25 — 29).

11.7.4. The approach adopted by POL was to identify a core population of key responsive
documents for each of Requests 25 — 29 from the documents produced by POL to
the Inquiry on 18 March 2022. From that core population of documents, POL
deployed functionality within Relativity to identify "clusters" of conceptually similar
documents, over which POL then conducted searches. Documents which were
identified by Relativity as being highly likely to be of a similar type to the core
population of documents were manually reviewed and responsive documents were
produced to the Inquiry.

11.7.5 Documents held by Third Party Advisers: HSF's letter of 18 March 2022
explained that POL had written to each of Deloitte, KPMG and Ernst & Young (each
of which had previously been engaged by POL in various capacities) to request

11174749700_13 53
Requests with a deadline of 15 April 2022

11.8

POL00114170ds
POL00114170ds

that they provide a complete record of the materials prepared during the course of
their respective engagements for POL, as well as copies of the same.

(A) Deloitte: Deloitte provided copies of the documents requested in advance
of the 18 March 2022 deadline, which POL manually reviewed. Responsive
documents were produced to the Inquiry on 18 March 2022.

(B) KPMG: KPMG provided copies of the documents requested on 6 May
2022, which POL manually reviewed. Responsive documents were
produced to the Inquiry on 12 May 2022.

(C) Emst & Young: As explained in HSF's letter dated 12 May 2022, Ernst &
Young has declined to provide the requested information and documents.

11.7.6 Repeated CCRC Searches: As explained in HSF's letter of 14 April 2022, it
became apparent that a substantial volume of materials stored in the CCRC
Database were missing extracted text (with the impact that these documents would
not have been caught by any of the targeted searches that had been conducted
across the CCRC Database). This issue was rectified and all searches previously
conducted over the entire CCRC Database were repeated, and responsive
documents were manually reviewed. Responsive documents were produced to the

Inquiry on 14 April 2022.

12.1. By its Request No. 11, the Inquiry sought various documents and information referred to in
the minutes of the POL Board and the Audit, Risk and Compliance Sub-Committee which
were previously produced to the Inquiry. The Inquiry requested that POL provide a
response by 31 March 2022.

12.2 POL has located and produced to the Inquiry the majority of documents responsive to the
request. In some cases, these documents were identified without needing to conduct broad
search and review exercises (including, for example, where documents were located on the
Company Secretary SharePoint). Where POL was unable easily to locate the requested
document or where the request was for multiple documents and initial enquiries /
investigations did not appear to have identified a comprehensive set of responsive materials,
supplemental searches were devised and conducted to address these gaps.

Supplemental Searches and Productions

12.4 Following the productions to the Inquiry on 31 March 2022 and 6 April 2022, POL continued
to conduct certain further search and review exercises in respect of the request. A brief
description in relation to these supplemental reviews is set out below.

12.4.1 Postal Museum and Oasis Documents: As explained above in the context of
POL's response to Request No. 10, POL arranged for supplemental visits to be
scheduled to these archives during the course of March 2022 with a view to
identifying further hard copy documents which may be responsive to this request.

12.4.2 All documents identified following the supplemental visits to the Oasis and Postal
Museum archives were scanned and uploaded onto POL's e-Discovery platform.

(A) To the extent that any of the above searches were conducted over
documents collated from the Postal Museum archives, these searches
were repeated over the more comprehensive set of Postal Museum
documents. All responsive documents were manually reviewed, and
documents identified as responsive to the request were produced to the
Inquiry.

(B) POL conducted a full manual review of each of the documents recently
collated from the Oasis archives for responsiveness to Request No. 11.

12.4.3 CCRC Documents: As explained in HSF's letter of 14 April 2022, it became
apparent that a substantial volume of materials stored in the CCRC Database were
missing extracted text (as a result of which these documents would not have been
caught by any of the targeted searches that had been conducted across the CCRC
Database). This issue was rectified and all searches previously conducted over the
entire CCRC Database were repeated, and responsive documents were manually
reviewed. Responsive documents were produced to the Inquiry on 14 April 2022.

12.4.4 On 13 May 2022 KPMG confirmed that, when re-running keyword searches over
the CCRC database following the resolution of the extracted text issue,
approximately 2,000 documents responsive to one of the searches were missed
due to a technical error. POL manually reviewed each of these documents and is
in a position to produce responsive documents to the Inquiry, once it has been
provided with a Quatrix link.

12.4.5 Additional Policy Documents: In HSF's letter of 31 March 2022, POL explained
that, in the case of certain of the policy documents requested under sub-request
48, updated versions of these policy documents had been provided to the Audit,
Risk and Compliance Sub-Committee for approval on 29 March 2022 and that POL
would provide copies once they had been formally approved. POL produced to the
Inquiry copies of each of these newly approved policies on 14 April 2022. POL
separately produced an updated version of the Postmaster Guide to Policies (as
well as the updated Postmaster Support Guide) on 6 May 2022.

12.5 Documents were initially produced to the Inquiry on 31 March 2022. Further responsive
documents were produced on 6 April 2022, 14 April 2022, and 6 May 2022. Across these
productions, POL has produced a total of 978 relevant documents.

13. OTHER PRODUCTIONS

13.1 In addition to the disclosures that POL has made in response to Rule 9 requests, POL has
also produced to the Inquiry copies of the documents that have to date been provided by
POL to Paula Vennells via her legal representatives Mishcon de Reya.

13.2 To date, 1,422 documents have been provided to Mishcon de Reya and therefore to the
Inquiry. In large part, the documents that POL has provided in response to requests received
from Mishcon de Reya have been limited to documents which relate to the period of Ms
Vennells' tenure at POL and, in some cases, were identified following targeted searches
across various electronic repositories (including, for example, the mailbox of Paula Vennells).

13.3 As explained in HSF's letter of 23 May 2022, POL has identified a series of meeting minutes
of a Working Group that was established in around 2013 for the purpose of discussing
"Horizon Issues" and anticipates that the content of these minutes will be of interest to the
Inquiry. HSF's letter of 23 May 2022 explained that POL would produce these documents to
the Inquiry following it issuing a Rule 9 request for production of the same.
