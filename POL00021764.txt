Belinda, Angela

As discussed briefly yesterday, I suspect that the information requested by lan below is highly commercial sensitive.

It may also be that the figures in question are quite high and this may then be portrayed as if there are significant sums
each month that cannot be reconciled within POL's accounts. The inference from this is that POL's processes /
accounting systems are flawed given the volume of discrepancies. Whether or not this is correct, it is an easy leap to
make.

Assuming that POL finance say that this info cannot be disclosed, I've penned out a short response to lan below.

Kind regards
Andy

The information you are seeking is highly commercially sensitive and therefore would only be made available in
exceptional circumstances.

As described in the Suspense Account Note provided to you, sums in POL's suspense account do not impact on branch
accounting but reflect unresolved matters between POL and its clients. I'd be grateful if you could explain why SS need
visibility of the suspense account figures given that the Part 2 Report and the CRRs are only focussed on the impact on
SPMRs.

Kind regards
Andy

Thank you Belinda, very helpful

In the light of the disclosure of rolling 3 year suspense account can we have details of month end balances for this
account for the last 3 years together with details of amounts released to P&L

Many thanks
