Thanks again!
My key points:

- he has already met Jones and Bridgen and wanted to afford us the same opportunity before reaching a view: a positive sign of
intent and fair dealing

- he couldn't understand why we had not spoken about individual cases: we explained our position
- he was most perplexed by JA: why would a parliamentarian of his standing continue to push the cases
- he asked questions about Fujitsu and Second Sight, including on remote access

- he was friendly and open with us: a refreshing change from his predecessor. We were very candid with him in response, which he
appreciated

- he was open in making clear he was undecided on whether to ask for a further session/inquiry: these were serious allegations about
a very important public business: but equally he was not interested in simply providing "another day in court"

- we offered further briefings and to provide him with key points on specific allegations around remote access
- we also offered a detailed rebuttal of Panorama

- we were clear we would have to go into more detail about individual cases if called to the committee: I think this point landed and
worried him

- he is persuadable in that Jones and Bridgen may be able to influence him but his primary issue is the standing of him as chairman.
and the committee

We should write to him, asking for opportunity to speak again. We might even consider suggesting a hearing following CCRC but
make point tha before then seems premature.
