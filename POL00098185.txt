Two versions. I’ve been unable to cut my initial summary further so will send that. This is really brief.
~The 14 branches impacted had to fulfil 4 specific conditions.
e Losses and/or gains were not archived as intended in 2010.
@ In 2011 and 2012 these losses or gains distorted the branches’ balances at the same time each year.
e Finance Service Centre (FSC) balances were impacted by equivalent unexplained values.

e In 2011 these values were written off bar the 2 largest values which were associated to branch discrepancies
settled centrally and challenged by 2 branches.

e Fujitsu have resolved the problem and put steps in place to avoid reoccurrence.

e FSC have prepared letters to branches to explain, pay back losses but not recover gains. Largest actual loss to a
branch is £226.28
