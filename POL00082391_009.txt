Mr Lee Castleton
Post Office® Marine Drive branch
14 South Marine Drive
Bridlington YO15 3DB

Dear Lee °
I am writing following our meeting on Monday 10 May 2004, in which you
put forward reasons why your contract for services should not be
summarily terminated.
I have reviewed the papers relating to this case very carefully and have
taken into account the points you have put forward.
After consideration I have decided to summarily terminate your contract for
services as Subpostmaster of Post Office® Marine Drive branch from the
date of your suspension, 23 March 2004, on the grounds that you have
had several large unexplained losses at your office totalling £25,758.75.
You were unable to make the losses good, which is in breach of your
Contract For Services. There are a number of obligations set out within the
Subpostmasters contract for services, one of which is that the branch is
well managed and the work performed to the satisfaction of Post Office
Ltd. I do not feel that you have achieved your obligations.
Please refer to your contract for services section 1, paragraphs 5 and 10
and section 12, paragraph 12.
You may, if you wish, appeal against my decision. If it is your intention to
appeal, you should notify me, in writing by 31 May 2004. The format of the
appeal can either be a personal interview or written submission. Should
you wish to progress this avenue, I will arrange for the appeal to be heard
by a member of Post Office Ltd Appeals Authority.
