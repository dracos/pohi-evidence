Thanks Chris — I hope you had a good holiday and that its effects haven’t been completely wiped away
already!

I bumped into Pete here at Post Office Finsbury Dials yesterday, who thought that he and Torstein could
meet sometime next week. I’m pulling some possible dates for them from this end, so hopefully that’s one
less (thankless admin) tasks for you to deal with!

Hello Rodric,

Many thanks for this. Just returned from holiday to a full Inbox in the time honoured tradition, so I am now
coming up for air!

I will get you back the signed NDA shortly.

Thank you also for the GPOC and its extracted sections. As regards meeting up to discuss, leave it with me
to liaise with the team, to come up with a few dates for your consideration.

Best regards,
Chris

Chris,

T hope this finds you well. I have now received the NDA executed by Post Office, and attach it for execution
by Fujitsu.

T also attach for your information the Generic Particulars of Claim filed in the Group litigation (without
Appendices, which are available on request). There are a number of sections of the GPoC which our leading
counsel Tony Robinson QC would like to discuss with Fujitsu in order to plead Post Office’s defence. These
sections have been extracted into the Word document attached. For ease of reference, I also attach
“Schedule 6” of our Letter of Response referred to in Section 24 of the GPoC (a draft of which was provided
to Fujitsu for comment before sending to Freeths).

I would be grateful if you could please let me know if and when the appropriate people from Fujitsu would
be available to discuss these sections with us. As ever, please feel free to give me a call if this is something
easier to discuss over the telephone.

With thanks and kind regards,

Rodric
