Dear Minister

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry — Your letter dated 9 October 2025

Thank you very much for your letter of 9 October 2025 together with the responses of the Department to the
recommendations set out in Vol 1 of my report. I am very pleased that the Department was able to respond to
my recommendations within the time frame set out in recommendation 1 and I am equally pleased that the
Department intends to publish proposals in relation to restorative justice by 31 October 2025.

As I know you will appreciate, I will be reflecting upon all the Department’s responses to my recommendations
over the coming weeks. I also intend to continue to monitor the operation of the redress schemes, and I will
also monitor the scheme or schemes which will shortly emerge for restorative justice. In these circumstances, I
have decided that any further observations and/or supplementary recommendations which I consider
appropriate to make on the topics of redress schemes and restorative justice should await the remaining
Volume of my report.

Yours sincerely

Sir Wyn Williams
Chair
