Dear Mr Arbuthnot

This letter is to confirm that Post Office Limited have budgeted a sum of £5000 to
pay for an independent forensic accountant to review the 2° Sight investigations
on behalf of the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance. Payment will be made on
receipt of invoices from the independent forensic account and I believe that Kay
Linnell has agreed to act in this capacity.

Yours sincerely

GRO I
