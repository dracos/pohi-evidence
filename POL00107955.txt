Thanks Lesley. In that case - how about 9.30-10am for the next four working days?

Best,

Nina

Nina

In this case I suggest that we just go for the best time and we need to manage around it.

Thx

No problem Mark.
I appreciate it's tricky with everyone's busy diaries. But in order to manage this reputational issue
most effectively, our top priority will be to ensure everyone can attend one conference call a day for

the next four working days, to ensure there is one forum for important decision making about our
Communications approach, as publication date draws near.

As Mark says, it would be great to have you all available at this daily conference call so we can also
integrate Portland into our discussions and properly benefit from their independent perspective. It may
only require 10 or 15 minutes on some days.

May I suggest an agenda along the following lines:

1. Media Strategy - Mark

Overall approach

Statement update

Q&A update

2. Internal Communications - Richard

3. Stakeholder Relations - Mike

4. AOB

Lesley, Alwen, Mark, Martin and Susan - given that your diaries are likely to be the most busy, are your
PAs able to co-ordinate the best times? We'll then flex our diaries to accommodate

Thank you everyone

Nina

Nina

Please can you set up a daily comms call on the Horizon issue with all those copied and include Portland
on it.

If others need to be involved please can colleagues suggest names.
