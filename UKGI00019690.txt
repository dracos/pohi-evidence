Re prosecutions are we sure? They are a prosecuting authority, which might be the same as an LA, but not the same as
Joe Schmoe.

Indeed — hence checking we hadn’t laid it yet. Louise, the title will be “Post Office Limited” but I will confirm by 5.30pm

whether we are laying it or not.

I have checked with POL — they do not have any special power to prosecute. They operate in a similar way to e.g. local
authorities in terms of prosecutions.

Thanks
Laura

Laura — we need confirmation of the grid slot before we lay the title

Hi Claire

Thanks very much for this. I am checking on the point about prosecution and will get back to you.
Yes, I think that’s right in terms of next steps. Parly, have we laid the WMS title yet?

Thanks

Thanks Laura — Jo has now approved the text of the WMS and has also had sight of the text of Paula’s letter. Reading her
letter did prompt Jo to ask for a reminder (for her background info) of whether POL has special powers to prosecute
over and above that of a private citizen — do you know the answer please?

So I think we are now just waiting for the final signed letter to come through and for confirmation of the grid slot before
we lay the WMS title. Hannah could you update us on progress on the grid slot please?

Thanks,
Claire

Hi Charlie cc. Claire

We spoke just now about this WMS that Jo Swinson is due to lay tomorrow regarding the Post Office’s mediation
scheme for their Horizon system. We need the WMS to be repeated in the Lords in the Baroness’ name, so that we can
lay a copy of the letter from Post Office’s CEO in the libraries of both Houses.

I attach the most recent submission to Jo Swinson on the issue — you'll note that Jo has decided she would like to lay a
WMS. The current draft of the WMS, and some reactive-only press lines, are also attached. These are with Jo at the
moment for clearance. We don’t yet have a copy of the Post Office CEO’s letter, but we should get this later today.

As I explained, this is a very complicated issue, and one which has been going on for quite a while. To reiterate, the
reason we are laying a WMS is because of the interest in Parliament on this issue — several MPs have raised individual
cases, there is a group of MPs campaigning on this (led by James Arbuthnot MP) and the HoC BIS Select Committee
recently conducted an evidence session on this. However, the scheme is independent of Government and a commercial
matter for Post Office.

Below is some more background on the issue, for the Minister’s information.

Do let me know if you need any more information. The WMS is due to be laid tomorrow (Tuesday 10 March) although
we are still finalising a grid slot.

Many thanks
Laura

As background, the majority of Post Offices are operated by subpostmasters — usually
independent businesspeople (or multiple retailers e.g. WHSmith) who contract with Post
Office Limited to provide post office services, a bit like a franchise agreement.

Following complaints about the Horizon IT system (used in all Post Office branches), the Post
Office commissioned an independent firm, Second Sight, to examine the system. Second
Sight published their report in July 2013. Whilst the report made clear that there was no
evidence of system-wide problems with Horizon, Post Office acknowledged that the report
raised questions about the training and support offered to some subpostmasters and made
plain its determination to address them, by:

e Establishing a Working Group to review cases;

e Appointing an independent chair for the process; and

e Creating a branch user form to create a feedback loop for users.

These measures are now in place, with Sir Anthony Hooper (a former member of the Court of
Appeal in England and Wales) chairing the working group which consists of Post Office and
the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance. The group oversees cases through an independent
review and mediation scheme. It is important to stress that despite further investigations in to
individual cases since July 2013, it continues to be the case that there is no evidence of
system wide problems with the Horizon system.

The system processes 6 million transactions every working day across a Post Office network
in excess of 11,500 branches. Nearly 500,000 users have used Horizon since it was
introduced in 2000, serving millions upon millions of customers, meaning that the c150
subpostmasters in the scheme represent a very small minority with complaints.

The mediation scheme is independent of Government and details of individual cases within
the scheme are confidential.

As discussed (and with thanks for the extension to the box deadline) please see attached submission for Jo Swinson on
the Post Office mediation scheme. I’d be grateful if this can go in the Minister’s box today flagged for her urgent
attention — in particular, we would welcome her early steer on whether she agrees with the decision not to table a WMS
for the day of this announcement.

Hannah in Comms has agreed our recommendation of a reactive, BIS-spokesperson line only.

Georgie — I'll be in touch separately about the WMS point.

Thanks
