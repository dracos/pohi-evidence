Severity 1 — Branch Network Incident Ginwnsoe

Issue Summary
- Commenced Thursday, 9°" June 2016 at 13:06
- Layer-Two Network Switch (LNS) failed

- Service designed with 6 LNSs — These are used to connect broadband sessions from Branches to the Fujitsu Data
Centres

- Branch connections are load-balanced across the devices
- Branches impacted would reconnect to another LNS

- At 14:20 several hundred broadband sessions were dropped from one of the five remaining LNS routers — this was
due to a load balancing activity

Impact
- Majority of Branches experienced between 0 and 10 minutes outage

- Variance depends on whether the Branch router automatically switched over to the backup network, or the
Branch rebooted the router

- Approximately 17% of Branches using broadband were impacted
- Monitoring identified 1% of Branches had not reconnected following the initial issue

- Investigation discovered authentication issues and ‘stale’ sessions (which were stopping Branches from
reconnecting)

- All sessions were restored by the Service Teams by 16:10

Root Cause

- LNS failed due to a software crash.

- Device has a history of reliability

: No faults or errors identified

- Device will be tested and checked rigorously before re-introduction to service

Severity 2 — Self Service Kiosk Incident Guweacoe

Issue Summary
- Commenced Wednesday, 15" June 2016 at 10:40
- SSKs not accepting card payments either via reader or contactless device

- Small number of Branches reported the issue

Impact

- Impact included Branches yet to receive contactless upgrade as well as those who had been upgraded
- Kiosks continued to operate in ‘cash mode’

- Investigations identified transactions ‘timing out’

Resolution Activity

- Investigations by NCR, WorldPay, GlobalPay and Fujitsu

- Network link utilisation threshold identified as exceeding 10 Mbit/s capacity into the NCR Data Centre
- Management Tool Application generating significant inbound traffic from transaction log requests

- Management Tool link terminated to reduce bandwidth load experienced

Root Cause Investigation
- Investigation by NCR into the Management Tool
- Network link is shared between Horizon Business Service, WorldPay and Maintenance Tool

- Root cause for bandwidth load to be determined however there is likely to be traffic prioritisation criteria applied
to protect the capacity required for the live production service

- Tool remains disconnected.

Service levels were improved in
December 2015.

The scope of a Priority 1 incident has
been extended to include any VIP site
with a SSK down & 50% or more
unavailable in any site (previously only
branch with SINGLE kiosk being
unavailable)

Post Office now has equal access to the
NCR multi-client leveraged engineer

improved.

Service levels are much improved and
low volume kiosk outages.

For new P1 category, a single device
restoration within 24 hours is improved
from 91.7% to 92.2% however the
scope is significantly broader.

Branches with 50% kiosks unavailable is

Preventative Maintenance
(PM) calls have been created as
part of individual SSK
monitoring of branches with
‘regular’ device faults

If an SSK generates 4 or more
calls per calendar month, it will
have a PM call raised for an
engineer to attend and then
the performance will be
monitored for the following 12
weeks.

If the Service Calls Measured
per Quarter (SCMQ) is <1.75
per month target, it will be
closed.

If this remains above the
threshold a further month of
monitoring will occur before
deciding whether to schedule
another visit. The tracker is
shown below up to and
including May’s results.
