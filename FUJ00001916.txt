network banking and other similar services including future use for
EFTPOS and SMART card applications, when these requirements are
defined. Only one type of PIN Pad is proposed. PIN Pads will be capable
of being fitted to every customer facing position which supports the
Pathway’s Network Banking Service installed in the Horizon system.

Note:

= There will be no specific hand held version. Note however that where
deployed with Mobile Positions the PIN Pad is not attached to a ‘pay pole’.

= Mobile Positions - security restrictions dictate that the same PIN Pad must
be plugged into the Mobile unit whenever the Mobile unit is in use.
including when it is transported and used at a different location. The PIN
Pad does not need to_ remain connected during transport. The method of
connection is via the RJ12 connector to the Specialix card

= Note — A design change to the Mobile Unit is advised to enable an easy
mechanism for connection and disconnection.

2.1.1 Overview

1. The hardware includes a keyboard, display, security module,
integrated smart card reader and interface to four (4) SAM modules. It
is capable of being externally interfaced to connect to a contact-less
card reader. It consists of the following :-

a. Mains cable assembly, comprising a mains (230 volt, a.c., 50Hz)
adaptor to allow connection to the rear of the Horizon counter
equipment. This is plugged into the counter PC in place of the
normal IEC320 mains power connection, and provides a suitable
connector into which the normal mains connector is plugged.

b. Mains power supply unit (PSU), comprising a transformer unit
with IEC320 male connector, and a 12 volt DC cable to connect
to the data cable adaptor.

c. Data cable assembly to enable connection of the PIN Pad to the
Horizon counter equipment. The data cable includes a d.c.
power adaptor as part of the construction, to provide 12 volt DC
power supply connection to the mains PSU.

2. A support arrangement comprising brackets and supporting metalwork
(‘Pay Pole”) to enable the PIN Pad to be mounted on or near the
counter position. Detailed drawings of the support arrangement are
provided later in this specification.

3. The device is provided with software for basic device management
functions and a secure method of PIN entry. The PIN Pad shall be
supplied certified to EMV 3.1.1 Level 1. The PIN Pad will be supplied,
with the capability to be remotely upgraded to support EMV2000 Level
2.

4. Additional devices have been attached to the PIN-Pad, principally to
ensure compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. They
include:

a. akey guard covering unused PIN-Pad buttons

b. a raised dot stuck to the ‘5’ key

c. atextured guide identifying the CAN, CLR and ENT keys
d

. acard-insertion guide in the form of a ‘funnel’ — see Associated
Documents [e] [f]

e. a privacy shield (for mobile counters)

The PIN Pad shall meet the anti-tamper requirements of ISO 9564 as set
out in §6.3.3c such that tampering with the device itself, for example in
order to insert tapping or bugging equipment, shall result in sufficient
damage to the device to cause it to become inoperable.

It shall be capable of being remotely upgradeable to triple DES(which will
require a new key to be loaded into the PIN Pad)

Components

The basic hardware components of the PIN Pad include the following main
parts:

2.1.3. MOUNTING KIT otherwise known as the “Pay Pole”

The specification of the “Pay Pole” will be documented in Ref [B], and an
outline is included in this document for information only.

This is a sturdy metal and plastic design, which will fix onto the counter. It
will mount the PIN Pad in a secure way, such that removal of the PIN Pad
from the counter area by anyone other than an authorised person would
prove difficult. The pole and the terminal holder are painted in RAL 7021
black finish.

5 Functional Requirements

5.1.1 PIN Entry

e All PIN Pad displays associated with PIN entry will be controllable
from the counter PC.

e The PIN Pad will allow the entry of multiple digit PINs of variable
length, between 4 and 12 digits.

e The PIN length shall be unknown to the PIN Pad on PIN entry. The
‘Enter’ key must be used to terminate PIN entry. Use of the 'Enter'
key before entry of 4 digits will not be permitted.

e The ‘CAN’ key will operate at any time during PIN entry to
terminate the entry.

e The ‘CLR’ key, when pressed during PIN entry, shall erase the
complete user input. There will be no limit to the number of times
that the ‘CLR’ key can be pressed during PIN entry.

e Any digits entered after the 12th will be ignored. Only the ‘Clear’
and ‘Enter’ keys will be acceptable at this stage. (i.e. the maximum
length of PIN acceptable is 12 digits in length. The Cancel key can
be used at any time, in conjunction with the counter application to
abort the customer's session.

e The PIN will never be displayed in a readable form on the display;
Asterisks will be displayed to represent each character entered as
part of a PIN.

e Once the Customer presses the ‘Enter’ key, the PIN Pad will
encrypt the PIN and transmit the encrypted PIN. The plain text PIN
will never be transmitted. The timeout is not determined by the PIN
pad.

e There is a timeout in the PIN Pad driver, which will clear the
screen if there are no outstanding commands; this is configurable
via Reference Data.

5.1.2 EMV

e The PIN Pad shall be supplied certified to EMV 3.1.1 Level 1. The
PIN Pad will be supplied, with the capability to be remotely
upgraded to support EMV2000 Level 2 when available.
