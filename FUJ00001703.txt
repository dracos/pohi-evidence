1 Introduction

As part of the Horizon system implementation for Post Office Ltd, Fujitsu Services
(Pathway) Limited (known as “Pathway”) has installed Horizon training systems in
Counter Training Offices (CTOs) at various locations in the national network of Post
Office branches. Post Office Ltd trainers use these systems to deliver steady state
training for new staff and subpostmasters now that Horizon National Rollout training
has been completed.

2 Scope

This document is divided into two main sections which cover the following:

1. The current situation. This includes describing the original requirement and the
solution implemented.

2. The strategy and process which is adopted for providing system builds with which
to upgrade the CTOs, including dependencies. This was agreed in CCN 898d.

Note that much of the information included in version 2.0 of this document has been
removed. That information related to the strategy and principles adopted for installing
Horizon systems in the CTOs. Please refer to version 2.0 of this document for details
of the implementation strategy adopted.

3 Current situation

3.1

3.2

Summary of Requirement

A total of 42 CTOs were planned to have Horizon training systems installed during
National Rollout. Two further support locations were also to be fitted with Horizon
systems.

The requirement was for 328 training counter systems, plus two A4 printers per site,
to be installed in the CTOs, plus 5 further counters in the two support locations. The
total of 333 was included within the overall limit for all outlet counter positions, as
described in the Codified Agreement, Schedule A1l2, Annex 5. These systems were
installed with the latest available version of the Horizon system training build at the
time of rollout.. The full list of CTO and support locations is provided in Appendix A —
Table of Counter Training Offices.

Description of Solution

Currently there are a total of 353 counters installed in 44 CTOs, and four support
locations (i.e. NBSC at Dearne House and Doxford, TP at Chesterfield, and Training
Development in Colchester). This represents an increase in counters and locations over
the original requirement. Some of the equipment has also been relocated to new (or
other) CTOs since the original rollout plan was devised and implemented. The current
list is held in Appendix A — Table of Counter Training Offices.

Hardware

3.2.1

3.2.2

Each CTO is equipped with free-standing Horizon training systems. A summary of the
hardware used is listed below:

a Fujitsu Pentium I processor unit (X453), featuring:

= 166Mhz Pentium I processor

= 64 Mb RAM

= 4.3Gb exchangeable hard disk

10” SVGA CRT colour monitor, incorporating touch screen
Keyboard featuring magnetic swipe card reader and smart card reader
Ithaca counter printer

Welch Allyn bar-code reader

Epson Stylus 200 printers (two per office)

ooood

Each training system is a stand alone counter. Two of the counters will be connected
to the Epson 200 inkjet printers. There is no connection to any other counter or server
and all the counters are identical in every way.

Software

The systems are built as standard training counters, of the type and software level used
for delivering classroom training to outlet managers and their staff during the National
Rollout of Horizon. At the time of installation the systems mirrored the functionality of
the systems being installed in live offices at the start of National Rollout. This release
was known as CSR. Since then, an upgrade has been performed at release CSR+, at a
level known as CI4.

The systems also reflect the functionality described in the training workbooks issued
on training courses at the during national rollout.

The training counter also features facilities to run and reset POLO, and to reset the
training data. Note that, unlike training mode, the training data is not reset
automatically at power up/power down, or at logout. The CTO counter build currently
contains both the standard UK training build and the Northern Ireland variant. The
trainer is able to select which variant to load up and run. This build will also support
use of the OKI 8P+ printer as well as the Epson Stylus 200.

The systems feature the same set of training data used by Pathway in training mode
and the delivery of training for the rollout programme, both at CSR and CSR+. When
the CTO systems were refreshed to reflect the functionality being introduced at CSR+,
additional data was included allowing trainers to set exercises which use some of Post
Office Ltd’s own training aids: i.e. bar coded bills and bar coded order books. All this
data is documented and detailed in IM/ION/003.

This training build differs from the standard counter build in a number of ways:
= All the data used in training is pre-configured and held locally in each counter.
= At power on the system boots up to the Windows NT desktop

= The administrator has access to the Windows NT operating system to perform
basic housekeeping functions (e.g. reset the training data, reset POLO).

Fujitsu Services Counter Training Offices Strategy Ref: IM/STR/056
Version: 3.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 27-NOV-2002

3.2.3

3.2.4

= The Windows NT desktop features icons allowing administrators and users to reset
the training data, load up or shut down the Riposte system, run POLO as a
standalone application and reset POLO. These features are described in detail on
the Pathway Train The Trainer course, and Post Office Ltd trainers who have
attended this course are fully trained in the use of these features.

= Note that since release Cl4 of Horizon, the training counter build no longer
supports the use of OBCS training scenarios in live mode. This is due to the way
OBCS now works — training scenarios are rejected in live mode on the live
counter, and are therefore rejected in live on the training counter. They do work in
training mode on the training counter, as they do in training mode on the live
counter.

Fault reporting

Faults with equipment will be logged by a trainer on site at the CTO, (who must be
Horizon certified by Post Office Ltd or Pathway to use the equipment to deliver
training) or by a nominated central contact (usually the Training Manager Admin) via
the Horizon System Help Desk. The caller will report the FAD code and declare the
nature of the fault.

The Horizon System Help Desk will endeavour to provide assistance in the resolution
of calls, before requesting further action (see below).

Hardware maintenance & support

Pathway will provide support services for the hardware. Equipment which requires
attention or support must be located at the CTO, as maintenance can only be carried
out at the installation address. Maintenance will be performed by Pathway who will
send an engineer to site, in response to a call for hardware failure. Faulty hardware will
be repaired or replaced on site if it cannot be readily fixed.

Faults will only be handled at the site where the equipment is registered, therefore any
equipment which is off-site (for example as part of a “mobile” CTO) needs to be
returned to its home location before it can receive attention.

The engineer will visit the CTO on the day after the fault was logged, provided the call
is made before midday.

Pathway will recover from Post Office Ltd any charges for repairs carried out on items
outside warranty (i.e. for physical damage caused by carelessness, misuse or wilful
damage) and for service calls where no fault is found in an item.

If a call for support is logged, but the fault is then found and fixed by the originator, or
is no longer apparent, the call originator must contact the HSH to close the call before
the engineer arrives on site.

If a dispute arises over liability for damage, and/or repair or replacement charges
incurred, Clause 807 of the Codified Agreement makes provision for the matter to be
settled amicably to the satisfaction of all parties.

3.3

Response targets

For hardware calls, next day service is provided by Pathway, on condition that the call
is logged before midday. Afternoon calls will not guarantee next day service, but the
engineer will visit the CTO within two working days. Equipment will be repaired on
site if possible, or swapped out.

The equipment in the CTOs is used for training and not for serving customers,
therefore this level of service is the most appropriate.

Calls logged for the CTOs will not be subject to the standard service level agreement
analyses in place for the rest of the Horizon project.

Equipment movement

The control of equipment, once it is installed in the CTOs, is very important.
Equipment may only be moved off-site in exceptional circumstances by Post Office
Ltd’s Horizon certified staff or internally trained trainers, and not without the authority
of the Training Manager Admin, in the interests of both the security of the Horizon
system infrastructure and of the physical safety of the hardware.

The Training Manager Admin must personally (on behalf of whoever wishes to remove
the equipment) telephone Pathway Training Services Manager, with a justification for
the movement of the equipment. The Post Office Ltd Training Manager Admin must
also authorise the filling out an asset movement form, as shown in Appendix C -
Equipment Movement form, allocating a reference number, and detailing the
equipment serial numbers, the location of the transfer, the dates and justification of the
transfer. A copy of this form must be posted to the Training Services Manager at
Pathway in every instance. The address is at the bottom of the form.

Where equipment needs to be moved off site, the person responsible must ensure the
safety and security of the system at all times, and take appropriate measures for
ensuring it is securely packaged. The originator of the request may undertake to
transport the equipment himself or herself, or hire a courier. In both cases Post Office
Ltd is responsible for the well-being of the equipment.

Equipment should be returned to its original location, at the earliest opportunity.

Calls may not be logged for equipment which is off site, and maintenance of equipment
will only be carried out while it is in the CTO itself.

Should Post Office Ltd wish to relocate the entire set of equipment from one CTO to
another, this request must be channelled directly to Pathway Training Services
Manager. The relocation will be carried out by Pathway, who will provide appropriate
packaging and secure transport. Costs for the relocation of the equipment will be
borne by Post Office Ltd.

Horizon equipment may, however, be freely disconnected and packed away when not
in use, or when the CTO is required for other training activities. The reconnection of
the equipment must be performed by Post Office Ltd trainers who have been certified
by Pathway.

4 Duration of contract

Pathway have installed the CTOs according to a plan agreed with subcontractors and
with Post Office Ltd.

The equipment will remain the property of Pathway but, once installed on-site, the
Training Manager Admin shall be responsible for its security and operation and for
advising Pathway of any equipment movements.

The equipment will remain on site in the CTOs for the duration of the Horizon project
contract. However, it is possible that the equipment will be upgraded or superseded
during the lifetime of the project.

Pathway provided a revision to the training systems at CSR+, in line with the revision
to the training systems being used during National Rollout.

Following approval of CCN 898d, there is now provision for Post Office Ltd to
request and receive software upgrades to the equipment installed in the CTOs, until the
end of the Horizon contract.

5 Upgrading the software level

The systems will receive software upgrades as planned and agree between Pathway
and Post Office Ltd. Because of the standalone nature of the systems, it is not possible
to keep them up to date with the reference data changes which are regularly sent to the
networked systems installed in the live post office outlets.

Each counter is fitted with a removable hard disk. This enables replacement disks to be
easily swapped in and out on site for the purpose of upgrading the systems to a newer
release when required.

The strategy for upgrading the CTO systems to the next release of software is
summarised as follows:

1. Post Office Ltd submit a request for build by e-mail to the Pathway Training
Services Manager

2. Pathway develop, approve (in conjunction with Post Office Ltd) and baseline a new
training counter build, capturing all changes to the system implemented since the
previous release.

3. Pathway devise and agree a schedule with Post Office Ltd and for building the
removable hard disks and upgrading the CTOs. The disk swap-out exercise will
take approximately 15 man-days and is dependent on the availability of sites to fall
into the optimum schedule.

4. The Training Manager Admin will communicate directly with the CTO to ensure
that a Post Office Ltd representative will be on site at the CTO to receive the disks
or welcome the Pathway installer on the specified installation date

FUJ00001703
Fujitsu Services Counter Training Offices Strategy Ref: IM/STR/056
Version: 3.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 27-NOV-2002

5. Pathway build the agreed number of removable hard disks to the required software
upgrade level.

6. Pathway pack the removable hard disks into the specially designed packaging, and
despatch them to the CTOs according to the plan agreed in point (2) above.

7. One of two approaches will then be adopted, depending on expediency. Either:

a) The Pathway installer obtains access to the site via a Post Office Ltd
representative. Following a set of enclosed instructions, the installer removes
the existing disks from the installed CTO systems, fits the new ones, packs the
old ones and returns to the source address immediately,

or

b) A nominated representative of Post Office Ltd (preferably a trainer) receives
the disks at the CTO at the appointed hour. Following a set of enclosed
instructions, the Post Office Ltd representative removes the existing disks from
the installed CTO systems, fits the new ones, packs and returns the old ones to
the source address using a courier or other secure means of transport. The old
disks must be returned to source within 5 working days.

The installer of the new disks should, if the equipment is connected and in position
for use, boot up each counter to check that the disk has been fitted correctly and
that the operating system loads up. The installer will also verify that the build
identifier on the screen is correct. Once the upgrade is complete, the systems will
be ready for use immediately.

The software upgrade will not be implemented at any counter where Equipment is
found to be faulty at site. If any faulty Equipment is found on site the trainer or his
appointed representative will log a call with HSH to report the fault and at the
same time will inform HSH that it was not possible to perform the software
upgrade and therefore a further visit will be required to rectify the fault and
perform the upgrade.

For clarification, there is no support in the training counter for PIN Pads, Debit
Card Method of Payment (in the event that contractual agreement is reached on
implementing Debit Card Method of Payment) or NBS, since these features are not
supported in training mode. Support for these features would require additional
development and testing effort and would need to be requested separately.

This Service can be requested up to 4 times per year, with an interval of not less
than 13 weeks. The lead-time from the date of request to the point where the
upgrade is ready to be implemented is approximately 2 months.

Pathway will charge for this service in accordance with Schedule A12 para 8.4 of
the Codified Agreement.

stating that the work has been satisfactorily carried out and the equipment left in
working order.
