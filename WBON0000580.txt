Hi Andy

Further to our chat yesterday, here is Angela's statement taken as far as I can take it pending further input from Kath
Alexander who I spoke to this morning. I have also highlighted sections which might require input from other PO
employees.

I understand you will now give it a detailed review. Angela said she would need to review it either on Friday or by noon
on Monday. She has apparently blocked out next Thursday and Friday to deal with the statement.

Not sure how that fits in with your suggested discussion of the statement with Rod and a possible extension of time for
service of statements?

Thanks

Ivan
