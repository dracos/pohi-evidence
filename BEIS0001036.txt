1.2 Overturned Convictions (OC)

Initial interim payments are available to eligible postmasters upon getting their
conviction overturned on the grounds that it was reliant on Horizon evidence.

A ‘full’ settlement comprises both pecuniary (financial) and non-pecuniary
(personal) losses, but the Post Office has been progressing non-pecuniary
settlements first to get money to postmasters as quickly as possible. This
means a number of partial settlements have been reached in addition to the full
and final settlements published here.
BEIS0001036
BEISO001036

The department is now publishing data on full and final settlements. Claims
received are no longer being broken down into pecuniary and non-pecuniary
settlements as in previous months.

Any individual with a conviction overturned by the Post Office (Horizon System)
Offences Act 2024 or the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Act
will be eligible to seek financial redress via the Horizon Convictions Redress
Scheme (HCRS).

1.3 Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme

Out of the 555 who were members of the Group Litigation Order, 63
postmasters had convictions and are therefore eligible to apply for redress once
their conviction has been overturned. If their conviction has been overturned by
the courts, they are eligible under the Overturned Convictions (OC) Scheme. If
their conviction has been overturned by the legislation, they are eligible for
Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS).

The remaining 492 postmasters are currently eligible for the Group Litigation
Order scheme, of whom 484 qualify for interim payments. For disclosure
reasons, the exact number of initial interim payment claims paid is now
withheld. This month, the number of initial interim payments has not increased.

Work continues on distributing shares of the £19.5 million interim payments
announced in June 2022, particularly on remaining payments in complex
categories such as those recently deceased and people who have not taken up
the offer of an interim payment.

1.4 Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS)

Post Office received 2,417 eligible claims by March 2021.

The closure date for applications was 27 November 2020, but Post Office
continued to accept applications for the original deadline group up to March
2021.

In October 2022, the government announced that additional funding would be
provided so that eligible late claimants could receive financial redress, and the
scheme reopened for applications.

Post Office has received 1,662 eligible late claims to date.
BEIS0001036
BEISO001036

Interim payments on the HSS are available before and after claimants receive
an offer of redress.

The £144 million paid out on the HSS includes £31.3 million in interim
payments to original claimants and £5.7 million in interim payments to late
applications.

On 13 March 2024, the government announced that all eligible HSS claimants
would be entitled to a fixed sum award of £75,000.

Post Office have started making top-up payments to claimants who had
previously accepted a full and final offer below the value of £75,000.

As of 30 August 2024, approximately £14 million has been paid in award top-
ups.

1.5 Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS)

The Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 and the Post Office
(Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Act 2024 quashed Horizon-related
convictions on a blanket basis in June 2024, according to a set of criteria in the
Acts, covering each UK nation.

On 30 July 2024, the UK government announced the launch of the Horizon
Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS) (https://Awww.gov.uk/guidance/horizon-
convictions-redress-scheme-hcrs-applying-for-financial-redress), delivered by the
Department for Business and Trade (DBT), to provide financial redress to
postmasters across the UK who had their convictions quashed by the Acts.

Applicants have begun registering for the HCRS and the department is working
with the relevant justice authorities to confirm individual applicants’ eligibility for
the scheme.

Eligible applicants have a choice of 2 routes to redress: they can either accept
a fixed and final sum of £600,000, or they can choose to submit their
application to a detailed assessment process.

All eligible applicants are entitled to an initial interim payment of £200,000.
Beginning with this publication, the department is now publishing data on

settlements, broken down by initial interim payments and full and final
settlements.

2. GLO Scheme delivery target

DBT is committed to a target of making a first offer to 90% of claimants who
have submitted a full claim within 40 working days. A full claim is defined as a
claim which DBT considers, with advice from its legal advisors, does not need
any further evidence in order to assess every element of the claim.

Should the department consider further evidence is needed in order to make a
full assessment, the 40 working day target will not start until such time that the
required evidence is received from the claimant or any other source.

As of 30 August 2024, 90% of claimants received their first offer within 40
working days of submitting a full claim.

3. GLO Scheme £75,000 fixed payment
impact

Due to changes made in January 2024, all eligible GLO claimants are now
offered the option to settle their claims on a full and final basis for a total fixed
sum of £75,000 inclusive of interest, instead of making a claim for their
individual losses.

This means that the claim would not be assessed by the department against
the process set out in the guidance and principles
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-scheme-for-group-litigation-

order-case-postmasters).

Any payments received from the department to date or from the GLO settlement
will be deducted from the £75,000 before payment is made.

As of 30 August 2024, 207 offers have been accepted. 150 of these have
accepted offers of the £75,000 fixed payment. Of those who have accepted the
£75,000 fixed payment, four fifths are new claims and a fifth had previously
accepted offers.
