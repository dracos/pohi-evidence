Hi Siv,
Apologies for the delay. Two minor amends — grateful if you can make and I will send out today.

Could we add a line in to the effect of. ‘we should meet soon + my office will be in touch’? and on
bullet 2 can we say ‘all levels of the organisation including the top team’

Thanks,
Nicol

Hi Siv,

Apologies there has been a bit of a delay due to PAC, it is in box but haven't had a readout from
Sarah, will let you know as soon as she does. She has also asked to have an intro with Henry— do you
have a contact for him and/or his office — I couldn’t seem to find one (will also need for when she
clears letter).

Many thanks,
Nicol
