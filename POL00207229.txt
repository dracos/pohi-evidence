Dear Chris
The mediation test

I have received your submission on the test to be applied to decide whether an
application in the Scheme is recommended for mediation. I also have received
JFSAâ€™s reply to that submission and I understand that you too have been sent a copy
of that reply.

You will recall that prior to inviting submissions on the mediation test I had also
invited submissions on matter of who should apply the test, the Working Group or
Second Sight; or perhaps more specifically whether a case which Second Sight has
recommended for mediation should proceed straight to mediation without reference
to the Working Group. However on our last conference call we agreed that this
action had been superseded by the question of the test itself.

Having considered the submissions from Post Office and JFSA I now feel, on
reflection that the two matters, the test and who applies it, are inextricably linked and
in considering one I should also consider the other. I am therefore inviting you to
make a submission to me, setting out the views of the Post Office on who should
apply the test, Second Sight or the Working Group. I would be grateful if you could
provide me with your submission within the next seven days. Please also copy to
Alan Bates so that he can let me have his comments on your submission.

I have also written to Alan Bates to explain this.

Sir Anthony Hooper
Chair of the Working Group
