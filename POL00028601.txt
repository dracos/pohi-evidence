1. ‘Introduction
This report is produced by the PDA Operational Service Management team 4 =
and provides a high level “in-flight” assessment of any threats to overall BF

Business Continuity in the Congo 4 live service environment. The primary
purpose is to identify any issues (actual or potential) that might give rise to
considering a suspension of the Congo 4 roll-out or regression from ICL
Pathway services. This is an interim report which will continue on a weekly
basis pending a Full Business Continuity Report on 10/12/97.

For ease of reference, the report utilises a traffic light system with the
following keys -

6 = Immediate Threat to Business Continuity

Potential Threat to Business Continuity

@ = No Threat to Business Continuity

Further detailed information about the live service environment can be found
in the Weekly Service Management Report which is attached herewith.

NB Any comments about the content, format or value of cither report
would be welcomed by the PDA Operational Service Management
team at Terminal House.

2. End to End Business Continuity

There are no matters that need escalating for consideration of suspending the
Congo 4 roll-out and/or regressing from ICL Pathway services.

OBCS

The OBCS service was unavailable all day at 32 Congo 4 Post Offices on
Saturday 8th November. This resulted from an overnight failure in the ICL
Pathway “Maestro” scheduling environment. The OBCS service was
subsequently restored and available for Monday 10th November. This looks to
be an isolated occurrence.

ABED

There has been an unusually high occurrence of incidents at the ABED
interface.

This has been formally registered as a “Problem” and a solution is being
sought from ICL Pathway. The incidents have caused time delays and
additional work in the POCL Transaction Processing arena. This can be
Contained in the current low volume environment but gives cause for future
concern.

Fraud and Security

Prior to Release Authorisation, agreement had been reached with ICL Pathway
regarding the authentication of users to the Payment Card Helpline and .
Helpline to users. This solution involved the regular issue of passwords and
was intended to be an interim measure pending a full technical solution in
Release 2.

The agreement has subsequently been rescinded by a Pathway change control
board. The current position regarding authentication is therefore unclear. ICL
Pathway have been asked to provide a written proposal and risk.assessment by .
17/11/97. This will then need to be reviewed by the PDA and sponsor: “, * v
organisations. The updated position will be reported on 20/11/97. .
