I am advised that it is correct, we do update the software remotely and that a software update could result in
the desktop being closed and restarted, however even then, we don’t see how it would result in losses as is
being claimed. We do hold records of all updates and I have attached an extract of updates for the period Jan
- Apr 04 for your perusal. Software updates are relatively rare and (unless prior agreement is made with the
postmaster) they only take place outside of office hours with occasional extensions at the weekends, which
places them outside the normal operational hours of Horizon,

14. Attached is a copy of all updates for both counters (1 & 2) for Marine Drive between Jan - Apr 04 (incl).
2. In the Product column is shown an I, U, oraD; I= Install D=Delete U = Update.
3. Counter 1 shows there were no updates between 0830 & 1730 hrs over the period

4. Counter 2 shows (with exception to 2nd Feb) there were no updates between 0858 & 2206 hrs over the
period

The 2nd Feb shows 24 instances of (1,U,D,) at 1409 and 1 instance at 1410 hrs, which indicates that a
process (lasting one minute) started at 1409 and completed at 1410. I am advised that this was due probably
due to a counter installation and would have been with the postmasters knowledge and approval. Details of
the exact reasoning could be found if required.

I hope this is helpful to you,

Kind Regards Brian

Dear Brian

Firstly, I would like to thank you and your team for finding the time to meet us on Tuesday. We
found the meeting to be really worthwhile, helpful and productive. We will circulate a note of
the meeting shortly, just for everybody's record.

In the meantime, I attach a letter received on 7 June from Mr Castleton's solicitors. I have
highlighted the two paragraphs that I would like you to have a quick look at. Basically they
state the Horizon system is equipped with a facility via which its operating software can be
updated remotely via the connection to the PO's head office and that the system sometimes
went off line when there are software updates. They have therefore asked for documents

relating to the updating of the software of the system. My view is that they are making a stab
in the dark, but please could you ask your team whether they would have or could obtain any
records of software updates?

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
