A few issues to keep on the radar...

Would you mind liaising with Chris on 1 and 2 and I'll pick up with Rodric on 3?
1. Bankrupt applicants — need a discussion with Chris about the approach to be adopted.
2. Errors in third party (eg. Bank of Ireland) data — Chris to speak to Chris Day
3. Remote access to Horizon data — draft briefing with Rodric for review.
