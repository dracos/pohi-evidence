Subject: Re: Conduct Of criminal Investigations Meeting - 25/9/13

All,
The day (hopefully) will give us the opportunity to go through the documents, up skill around interview technique and
have discussion over any ambiguity or areas of concern you may have in a workshop session. It is vital that you spend
sometime going through the conduct of investigation policy and importantly actively participate on what will be an
interesting, informative and enjoyable day.

Regards

Rob

Subject: Conduct Of criminal Investigations Meeting - 25/9/13
All
Please find attached the Conduct Of Criminal Investigations policy along with relevant appendices, this is in readiness
for discussion at the meeting next week so please digest beforehand. You will be getting a hard copy on the day so
there is no need for you to print a copy off.

An agenda will be circulated on Monday.

Should people be called away to support the Crown Network then a decision will be made whether to reschedule the
event.

Regards
Andrew
