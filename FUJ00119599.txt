1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 SCOPE

The Related Agreements define a Release to be a documented collection of software and/or data
provided by the CONTRACTOR to deliver a Service.
This document describes the planned contents for New Release 2 (NR2).

1.2 OVERVIEW

‘The Releases identified as Pathway Release 1e and Pathway Release 2 no longer exist and have
effectively been withdrawn. NR2 has been created by Pathway in their place, in order to establish
a Release based on what was previously Release Le and re-prioritised elements of what was
Release 2.

The major new business components of this Release are:

the encashment processes
Help Desk support for the introduction of ‘Temporary Tokens
a CAS on-line interface.

Functionality will be delivered to provide:

BPS end to end service
EPO!
APS (covering magnetic stripe card and bar coded bills)

the technical and security infrastructure to support these services

To provide a method by which Pathway’s central systems will link directly to CAPS 3.0,
HAPS, ‘TIP and POCL RDS.

Migration will be from Release 1c (interfacing with CAPS 3.0) to NR2 (interfacing with CAPS 3.0
- Nile 2); to enable the Live Trial and contractual acceptance process.
