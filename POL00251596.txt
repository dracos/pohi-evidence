Second legal team from WBD
and additional Counsel.

KEY PEOPLE

Rodric Williams and Mark Underwood — significant demands will be placed on the time of Rodric and
Mark, frequently requiring immediate or very short notice responses. Consideration should be given
to whether they require more support.

Kath & Shirley — the loss of Kath & Shirley and their team would significantly harm Post Office's

prospects of success. They are an invaluable source of information. We would strongly recommend
that all efforts should be made to retain them at least to the conclusion of the trial in November 2018,
but most likely far beyond that.

PLSG - Given the tight timescales it is important that the PLSG is able to provide prompt instructions
from a fully quorate body. Consideration should be given to (i) deputies for PLSG members and (ii)
escalation routes up from the PLSG for critical decisions.

Counsel — Following the direction from GE, a second QC is being engaged to ensure that Post Office
can be represented and advised by a QC at all times.

WBD - WBD's legal team consists of 1 Partner, 2 Managing Associates and 5 other solicitors. A
further partner from WBD could be take a watching brief on the case to cover for Andrew Parsons if

unavailable.

5. COMMS

5.1 Key points for media interest are:
5.1.1 Selection of Lead Cases — 23 November 2017 and 23 February 2017
5.1.2 Addition of new Claimants to the Group Litigation - 24 November 2017
5.1.3 Submission of the Lead Claimants’ claims — 29 March 2017
5.1.4 Submission of evidence — 13 August 2017
5.1.5 Any Court hearing
5.1.6 Trial in November 2018

5.2 Does the comms team need further support / resources?

6. RISK MITIGATION

6.1 Counsel has been asked to prepare a full written advice on Post Office's prospects of success at the
November trial. This will be available at the end of March 2018. This advice will feed into a risk
mitigation plan for avoiding or minimising any adverse outcomes from the trial. Consideration needs
to be given to how and when to resource that risk mitigation team.

6.2 GE has asked that we "black hat" the litigation, by having someone argue against all our positions
and decisions. This could be done in a number of ways:

6.2.1 A rotating and independent senior person from POL could attend PLSG meetings.

6.2.2 Our new QC could be asked to reformulate the Claimant's case into the strongest terms
possible so to test the strength of Post Office's defences.

6.2.3 An independent partner from WBD could undertake a monthly arm's length review of the
case (this could be the same partner providing the watching brief at para 4.5 above).

7. FINANCES

7.1 WBD are preparing a full cost estimate up to the end of the November 2018 trial based on the Court's
current Orders. These estimates have been prepared on the basis that Post Office wishes to
robustly defend the claims to the very highest standard. Current estimates (which have not yet been
verified) are:
TAA Counsel: £4m
7.1.2 WBD: £1.9m

7.1.3 Other costs: £400k (e-disclosure; electronic trial bundles; transcription services, etc.)

7.2 We would also recommend an additional contingency of £2m against further Court orders /
unforeseeable events.

7.3 We will provide next week full cost estimates (with line by line breakdowns) and pricing proposals for
your consideration.
