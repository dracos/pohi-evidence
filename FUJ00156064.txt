Gavin — following discussions with our press folks and Suzie on Monday we have agreed that:

- we need to downplay this situation as much as possible, we don’t want to get too drawn in to the debate as we
are only a supplier

- there is a document that addresses all the technical questions that was produced for POL for a meeting with
MPs last week

- we should not contact the POL Press Office

- if press contact us we will send them on to the POL Press Office and not comment

- we will flag to Grayling (our Public Affairs agency) to get them to keep their ears open for parliamentary
questions etc

We'll keep an eye on this and if it looks like the situation is changing and/or becoming higher profile obviously we will
review with you.

Ann,

Can we also have our press office hook up with POL press office today on this too — | think this is hotting up - so we
need to be in sync and both using aligned/supporting messages. Suzie — can facilitate your introductions here.

Kind regards,

Gavin

Gavin — I'll brief the press office. We should prepare an FAQ/statement to have in our back pocket if required, and |
also want to explore doing some proactive work with them too e.g. getting some positive stories out there, building
some bridges with the journalists who might pick this up.

| have detailed below a brief summary of the sub postmaster claim that Horizon fails to maintain the integrity of branch
accounts if the branch experiences technical issues.

Horizon has been running for around 10 years, during which time Post Office has had to handle a number of legal
cases surrounding system integrity, mostly from apparently disgruntled or fraudulent sub postmasters. Fujitsu has
twice appeared in court to support Post Office. Only once has Post Office conceded its case, and this was at a time
when the audit trails were too short to provide sufficient evidence to refute a sub postmaster’s claims.

Recently a number of sub postmasters are again querying the data integrity of Horizon and are claiming that they are
owed money by the Post Office due to inaccurate branch accounts. These sub postmasters are talking to the press
(London News) and trying to gain some momentum to support their case - it's even rumoured that the BBC is
considering a Watchdog programme on this subject. Post Office is trying to head-off this possible escalation of
interest by preparing a stock of simple responses to possible questions from the media, or from interest groups. I
have summarised below the timeline that details when Post Office asked Fujitsu for assistance in compiling this
information

The initial request from Post Office (Dave Smith and David Gray - POL) was made on 24" September asking us to
join a conference call on Friday 25" September This call was to be hosted by Dave Smith where Dave would
outline his understanding of the situation and outline his response. Fujitsu would only comment if he made any
factual errors on how Horizon works.

* | spoke to Mike Wood, David Roberts and our Press Office as soon as the request was made. FJ Press Office
confirmed with POL Press Office that the journalist would not be present at this conference call and that it was
purely internal POL attendees. They also confirmed they did not want FJ responding to any questions from the
press or external organisations. This was a Post Office issue as the solution has been formally handed over to
Post Office. They only need Fujitsu for “expert” advise if required.

* Friday 25" September — conference call completed. FJ attendees Jeremy Worrell, Alan Hodgkinson, Jim Sweeting
and Howard Pritchard

* During the conference call POL requested from Fujitsu a short paper to describe how Horizon maintains the
integrity of the branch accounts when certain issues affect the branch eg blue screen, hardware failure. Report
requested to be given to Dave Smith by 2" October

* Gareth Jenkins (FJ architect) spent the best part of one day completing the report. The finished report was passed
to Amanda Craib (Commercial - at David Roberts request) before being sent to Dave Smith. Report was sent to
Dave Smith on Friday 2°’ October late morning just prior to a second conference call.

* Friday 2" October - second conference call - Dave thanked Fujitsu for the document — no further actions at this
stage.

* | spoke to Andy McLean on 5" October - he didn't expect any further activity for at least a couple of weeks.

* | spoke with Dave Smith on 3 December and he mentioned that the Data Integrity issue had reappeared. It has
been taken up by a Welsh MP who also happens to be a Barrister. He is threatening to bring an early day motion
in the House. Dave is meeting him in Parliament on Thursday 10" December but at this stage didn’t feel he
needed any attendance by Fujitsu. However, he was alerting us to the fact that this has reappeared.

In summary, our body of evidence is mature, so we're well-placed to help Post Office today. But when "Horizon

Online" is installed in 2010, much of our existing material will become irrelevant, so allegations of system failures in
the future may take more work in preparing evidence or explanations.

All

During my conversation with Dave Smith this evening Dave mentioned that the Data Integrity issue has reappeared
and has been taken up by a Welsh MP who also happens to be a Barrister. He is threatening to bring an early day
motion in the House. Dave is meeting him in Parliament on Thursday but at this stage didn’t feel he needed any
attendance by Fujitsu. However, he was alerting us to the fact that this has reappeared.
