Attached is a 7zip which is encrypted with a password. Inside is a normal Zip of the 1,491 deleted Horizon
and HNG-X kels.

I have included a banner on each KEL that states this is a deleted kel and is therefore “valueless to the
support of understanding of the system”. However I expect this to be ignored.

Please contact me for the pass-phrase.

@Gareth this is the same passphrase as used on the other KEL/Peak files.

Regards

John

Yes please proceed. When a KEL was ‘deleted’ was a reason given?

Yes I can rewrite the KEL export code for deleted KELs, about 0.5 MD to rewrite and test, 0.5 MD to run
and prepare output. 1MD total effort.

Remember that these KELs would have been deleted for a reason though and other then those that have been
fixed/superseded some may just be wrong, misleading, duplicates etc. There is a danger of them just causing
confusion.

Let me know if you want me to proceed.

Regards

John

On that subject, I was about to pass on the request from WBD that we supply them with all possible
retrievable KELs that we haven’t previously supplied.

Is it possible to provide clarity to them by retrieving all those that can be, and then a categorical statement
that all others really are deleted beyond retrieval?

View KEL will include any deprecated ones, but not any deleted ones.
I have previously looked for this KEL and could not find it anywhere.

@John: Does a “view KEL” search include the deprecated ones?

Steve,

Would someone be able to obtain DRowe1625K please? It is probably one of the deleted ones.

Matthew,

I appreciate you have already sent us the KELs and these are currently being uploaded onto our Relativity site. In the
meantime, our IT expert has requested DRowe1625K — would you be able to send me this one?
