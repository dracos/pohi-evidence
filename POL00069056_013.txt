However, it might be better if you addressed the letter to Mr
_. just in case the Postman delivers the
letter to the current PO in Gaerwen which is situated at Tyn Gamfa Stores, 1 Tyn Gamfa, Gaerwen, LL60
6DL.

Hope this helps

Mr Thomas was suspended as Postmaster at Gaerwen PO on 13 October 2005 when an audit resulted in
a large deficiency.

I asked 'Salford' for an address where Mr Thomas could be. contacted and was advised that the only

address that had was) GRO H

not do you have an alternative address for the former Postmaster?

Many thanks!
