Keith

Thank you for sending me the information you obtained on the above offices, unfortunately we seem
ta have ended up completely at cross purposes in terms of what I was hoping to obtain. I was looking
to have their transaction information interrogated to try and understand how the errors could have
occurred, I thought this was what we discussed in terms of obtaining information from Pathway which
would only normally be available if we suspected a fraud. What I have received from you is a fist of
the calls made to the Horizon System Helpline on behaif of the office over the period since go live. {
assume the information I have received is available basically at the touch of a button rather than as a
special request which we may have to pay a special payment for. {I'm sorry to say that I don't feel I am
any further forward with these offices.

Could you please advise me exactly what information Pathway hoid that we ought to be able to access.
if we have a situation in an office where we suspect a fraud and how we gain access to it. It seems to
me that this data should be available to us as a business and if we are unable to access it then this
has the potential for creating major problems for us. I am asking this because my boss is keen to
know how these suspense account issues will be resolved and I need to update him on where I am
with these two offices.
