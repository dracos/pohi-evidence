Shareholder Executive, who would be attending this and the March
Board before taking over from Susannah Storey.

Neil Hayward, Group People Director, Lesley Sewell, Chief

progress and the Business would welcome their input to help shape
the final Business Case which would return to the March Board.

(b) Lesley Sewell explained the cost reduction target already embedded
in the 2020 strategic plan and size of the potential opportunity
(excluding areas which were considered out of scope). The Board
challenged the Business to be more ambitious and asked Tim Lloyd
from Alsbridge to estimate the potential for further cost reduction. Tim
Lloyd explained that the current work had looked at the outsourcing
potential, but had yet to quantify the re-engineering opportunity. In his
view this opportunity could reduce the cost base by an additional 30 to
40 per cent. (c.£60-£80million).

(c) The Board agreed that outsourcing was feasible but that off-shoring
could be more difficult. The Board was concerned about the handling
of the staff consequences of outsourcing. They would need to
understand the size of the opportunity before taking any decision.

ACTION: (d) The Board asked the Business to be ambitious and return in March

Lesley Sewell with a paper outlining the options for discussion, showing: the different
cost reduction scenarios; the full cost of implementation; the possible
political ramifications of each scenario; and a timeline showing the
critical path for procurement.

(f) The Board discussed the use of a consultant to undertake Business
Process Mapping (BPM) and establish a Target Operating Model
baseline from which the Transformation Partner would work.

(g) The Board asked the Business to clarify the future CORE business
ACTION: processes before this work progressed. The CFO was asked to
CFO/ Lesley Sewell ensure the future supply chain strategy and how it related to the
Business Transformation was included in the work which would report

again to the March Board.

(h) The Board noted the progress made to date.
(i) Lesley Sewell, Brian Deveney and Tim Lloyd left the meeting.
(j) Neil Hayward updated the Board on the search for a Transformation
Director and agreed to circulate the job specification to the Board. He
explained that he had spoken to Lesley Sewell who had understood
ACTION: why the Business was looking for an experienced person, but had
Neil Hayward asked to be considered if no other candidate was found.

(k) Neil Hayward left the meeting

POLB 14/17 REVIEW OF THE CURRENT PROSECUTION POLICY

POL0000055
POL00021522
POL00021522

Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential

(a) Chris Aujard, General Counsel; Mark Davies, Communications
Director; and Belinda Crowe, Programme Director for Project Sparrow
joined the meeting.

(b) The Board received a report reviewing the Company's current
prosecution policy, which had been discussed at the Audit, Risk and
Compliance Committee (“ARC”) on 11 February 2014 and by the
Executive Committee (“ExCo”) on 13 February 2014.

ACTION: (c) The Board agreed that any communication regarding the changes in
Mark Davies approach to prosecutions should be reactive. The Business needed to
revise its key communication messages and be ready with them.

(d) The Board noted the summary of the discussions that had taken place
at ARC and ExCo.

(e) The Board approved the implementation of Option B as a new
Prosecutions Policy as detailed in Appendix A to the paper.

POLB 14/18 INITIAL COMPLAINT REVIEW AND MEDIATION SCHEME

(a) The Board received a report on the challenges facing the Initial
Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme (“the Scheme”), and the
steps being taken to address them.

(b) The CEO explained that the paper set out the worst case scenario as
the Board had requested. The Board were concerned by the potential
costs of the scheme and the level of possible compensation.

(c) The CEO agreed with the Board’s concerns, and reported that she
had met both Sir Anthony Hooper, the independent Chairman of the
Working Group, and Second Sight, the forensic accountants working
on the mediation scheme, to try and ascertain their opinions on how to
progress matters more quickly.

(d) The CEO informed the Board that Second Sight had yet to produce
their first written report for the mediation scheme, and that, until such
time as a number of reports had been produced, which would be over
the next four weeks, Sir Anthony Hooper felt unable to form a view on
the best way to manage the scheme going forward. He strongly
advised against taking any precipitous action at this stage. Sir
Anthony offered to meet the Board at a later date if that would be
helpful.

(e) The Board discussed the mediation scheme and possible support for
Second Sight to enable a more efficient process.

(f) It was noted that, in respect of each individual application, the project
team were taking extensive advice about the Post Office’s potential
jegal exposure. However, it was acknowledged that, in light of the
facts now available, and the projected level of legal claims and costs,
it would be sensible to commission more generic legal advice on the
overall level of legal and financial exposure (taking account of the

ACTION: possibility of class actions). This advice should consider the steps
Chris Aujard that could be taken to mitigate any exposure including considerations

POL0000055
POL00021522
POL00021522

Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential

of alternative structures that might be available to deal with the
mediation cases. Such advice should have regard to alternative
dispute resolution mechanisms, such as the Financial Ombudsman

Service.
ACTION: (g) The Board asked for an update to be circulated on the position with
Chris Aujard/ the Business’ insurance underwriters and asked the Business to
CFO revisit the legal advice on insurance to ensure it was robust and that

the correct disclosures had been made. The Board requested that all
future documentation consider potential insurance claims and
disclosure.

(h) The Board thanked the team for its candid report and noted the report
on the Scheme.

signed and branches opened. He explained that the retail surveys
received enabled the Business to produce a proposal on next year’s
targets, which would be completed within the next couple of weeks.

(d) Kevin Gilliland reported that over a thousand branches were now open
on a Sunday. Mains branches were performing well against target;
however, Locals were seeing a downward trend in mails products.

(e) The Board discussed the change in Locals which could lead to a more
transactional relationship with the customer and a move away from
the traditional community spirit. Kevin Gilliland acknowledged that this
was a risk but still felt that more could be done through initial training
to enhance the Locals offer.

(f) The Board sought assurance that the Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) with the NFSP would ensure support for Network
Transformation (NT), especially if a ‘cliff had to be used. Nick Beal
explained that the MoU included specific requirements for the NFSP to
support the delivery of NT to the whole network by 2018, so the ‘cliff’
was understood. He also reassured the Board that NFSP payments
would not commence until after the MoU was signed which would be
after the May NFSP conference, a timescale which the Business

supported.
ACTION: CFO/ (g) The Board asked Kevin Gilliland and the CFO to make the NT report
Kevin Gilliland in the performance pack clearer for the Board.
