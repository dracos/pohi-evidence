I think it got deleted by accident. I agree it should go back in.

Ok, in that case happy to retain. If it was my deletion I obviously didn't realise the ramifications!

Another one...

You've also deleted footnote 23 in para 88, regarding remote access. If we do not cover remote access, then
the entire statement needs to changed, because the statement is premised on the notion that SPMRs have
control over their accounts. That point is not 100% true, due to the remote access argument, but is 99.99%
true so we need to explain the remote access concept otherwise AVDB won't be telling the truth.

Given the sensitivities on this point, we need to cover it off.

Thoughts please?

Ok — I'm putting these back in but in simplified form. There is nothing secret about any of these — they are
all publicly available points of law.

Andy,

Gideon deleted those paragraphs.

I assume he did so on the basis that whilst the earlier paragraphs in that section are generic (and therefore
could be said to have been reasonably in the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting ) it would
be more difficult to justify the later more granular and specific examples (which have been deleted) on the
same basis.

Gideon — is this correct ?

Best,

Dz.

Quick question... why did you delete the section on regulatory requirements at para 62 onwards?

This is a major pressure on POL's business and drives lots of its pressures. Indeed, Post Office is probably
the most highly regulated business in the country.

Please find attached your updated statement (+ a comparison showing the changes from the original version
sent to you). This includes your comments, further amendments from Counsel and some comments from me.

Once you've had a chance to review, it might be easiest for us to setup a call to go through the remaining
points.

Thanks

Please find attached the latest version of my statement. This is still work in progress as I have some queries
out with the business. I will pick this up again on Monday when I should have the information I’ve
requested. In the meantime I’m returning to you as I have some comments for you/WBD that I’ve tracked —
could you review and let me have a response/update please. Where we’ve referenced other witness
statements it would be helpful if I could see them. Is this possible?

Thad intended to be on leave next week but in light of this being unfinished I am now in work on Monday
and will pick up for the rest of the week to finalise this statement ahead of submission deadline.

Thanks,

Angela

Please find attached the latest draft of your statement. All comments welcomed. This has been restructured
from the last version you saw, added a number of new sections and have cut out some material to make it

shorter / where we have considered material to be to far over the line of admissibility.

Rod — your comments also welcomed. In particular, there are some comments marked in green for your
attention.
