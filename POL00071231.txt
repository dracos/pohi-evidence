WITNESS STATEMENT OF Hi ea nasi y

1. Iam currently an Investigations, ‘anager for the Post, Office Limited (“the Post
Office”) and have been an Inv: tigations Manager since September 2004. Prior to
that, I was an auditor at the/Post Office for 5 years. I have worked for the Post
Office for nearly 9 years sjfce approximately February 1997. [Were you an
auditor when you fii s) Joined the Post Office in February 1997? If you
were, then I believe’ that you will have been an auditor for seven and a
half years insteador five years].

2. I make this Witness Statement in support of the Post Office’s Application for
Orders that: %

(a) Time.be extended until 16 November 2005 for the Claimant/Part 20 Defendant
to file and ‘serve its Reply to Defence and Defence to Counterclaim; and

(b) To set aside the Default Judgment on the Counterclaim entered against the
Claimant/Part 20 Defendant.

4A_1107425_1 1
3. I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless
otherwise stated. I have had the benefit of reading through the audit papers.
References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to page numbers of
Exhibit “HR 1” to this Witness Statement.

4, Asan Auditor, I was responsible for auditing Post Office Branches. I usually carried
out at least one audit every day, although sometimes it could be closer to two or
three audits and on one occasion I remember I did four audits. [On the basis
that Helen has 20 days holiday per year, I caiculate that she spent 285
working days per year doing audits. We need to ascertain precisely how
many years audit experience she had when she cai 1@ to audit the Marine
Drive Branch. If it was five years at an average of one audit per day, then
she will have done approximately 1,425 audits before she came to do the
Marine Drive Branch and it is worth putting this statistic in to show her
considerable audit experience]. x

5. On 23 March 2004, I attended the branch of the Post Office at 14 South Marine
Drive, Bridlington, YO15 3DB (“the Marine Drive Branch”), together with my
colleague Chris Taylor. We arrived at approximately 8.00.a.m. I had not had any
previous involvement with the Marine Drive Brandl

6. The process of cai rying out the audit involves physically counting the cash and
stock at the Marine Drive bra ich, checking the paperwork such as Giro deposits
and withdrawal receipts, Pensions and ‘Allowances Reports and where appropriate,
declared cash receipts.

7. Mr Castleton explained that he had been having problems balancing the books and
that those problems had started in the cash account week ending 43 (21 January
2004) with a shortfall of £4,230.97. Mr Castleton was adamant that the
misbalances were due to a computer problem and that no members of his staff
could be committing theft. In my considerable experience as an auditor, I have
never known there to be a single instance of a computer problem generating cash
shortfalls and Mr Castleton’s explanation sounded completely implausible to me.

8. A copy of the conclusion of my report is at page [ ]. In short, I concluded that
there were unauthorised losses of £25,758.75. This was a result of unauthorised
losses that had accumulated in the cash account and it had been transferred to the
suspense account for many weeks leading up to the audit.

9. As part of an audit, we have to complete a procedural security inspection. This was
carried out by my colleague Chris Taylor. A copy of the procedural and security

4A_1107425_1 2

POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231

inspection is at pages [ ]. A typed copy of the audit is at pages [] andthe
handwritten notes are pages [ ]. The inspection revealed that the safe was left
open, the safe keys were left in the safe door and it was not secured, that cash
and stock were not secured during lunchtime if the Sub-Postmaster was not on the
premises, that Travellers Cheques were not kept in the safe and Foreign Currency
was not held securely, that standard procedures for adjusting losses and gains
were not adhered to (because losses were unauthorised) and personal cheques on
hand had been incorrectly treated.

10. I do remember that Mr Castleton left the branch at lunchtime and returned in the
afternoon smelling strongly of alcohol. [Was he drunk? What did he say about
the result of the audit?]. .

11. I did not remove any documents from the Marine. Drive branch during the audit. If
there were any documents that are required, I always ask the Sub-Postmaster to
print off his spare copy. I understand that-one of the live issues in this case is
whether any balance snapshots were removed. A balance snapshot is a report that
contains what the computer believes is the total cash in stock figure. It looks at
the previous weeks’ declared cash in stock and adjusts’items as they are sold, so if
someone forgets to enter an item that a customer has purchased then the figures
will be inaccurate. I certainly do not recail remi ing any daily balance snapshots

ould not have been particularly useful

and for the reason I have explained, th

to me.

12. I was not involved with the case any further after completing the audit.

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.

Signed ...
HELEN ROSE.

Between 18 July 2003 and 25 March 2004, the branch of the Post Office at / GRO
GRO ~~ __jincurred losses oF
£27,115.83. During this time, Mr Castleton, the Defendant, was the Subpostmaster at
the Marine. Orive branch and responsible. far making goad all losses, whether caused

through his own negligence or that of his assistants.

E understanet that er or about 23 March 2004, Mr Castleton’s contract for services was
suspered because of large unexplained losses that had been reported occurring aver
the preceding 1Z weeks. An audit took place at the Marine Drive branch on 23 March
2004, followed by a full investigation, during which time Mr Castleton was interviewed
by Ms Catherine Oglesby, the Retail Line Manager who was dealing with the matter at
that stage. | understarxt thar on 17 May 2004, Mr Castleton was dismissed. 1 was
responsitie for dealing with Mr Castheton’s appeal against the dismissal.

L wrate. ta Mr Castleton an 21 June 2004 to canfirm that I had scheduled the appeal
hearing to take place orr 2 July 2004 (pages 1 to 2).

Pre-Appeat Enquiries.

7.

T attach a typed note of the Case History and the Notes of Appeal at pages 3 to 11. Mr
Castleton does not accept that the typed Note of the Appeal hearing is acawate, so a
copy of the hancbuwithen noke is. ak pages. 13 to 22. Before heasing the appeal, 1 tools
the following action:

L made enquiries with Chery! Woodward of the Post Office's Transaction Processing
Section ta check on the volume of error notices. recorded prior to the losses that
occurred between weeks 42 and 51. I alsa checker the level of exrar notices that bad
been received since the suspension on 23 March 2004. An error notice is. a correction
statement that is @ direct result of an incorrect entry being made by the operator or
the Horizerr Computer systerr where perfermnioxy a customer or bahancieg transaction. 1
noted that only one error notice had been received for £1,256.88 for a customer called
Dorothy Constable, which was charged to the Late Account. (The Late Account is a
holding account that is established following either the suspension or last day of
service of a Subpostmaster and records all previous errors that are recorded against
that branch, which have not been brought to account). Two smaller error notices
totalling £292 were also charged to the Late Account. I do not have the dates and
specific amounts for those errors totatting £292, but believe that they actually occurred
whilst Mr Castleton was the postmaster but had not been drawn to the attention of the
business until after he was suspended. As such Mr Castleton was liable. far the. errars.
which occurred during his period of appointment.

9. Lpersonally reconstructed and analysed the Marine Drive branch Cash Accounts for the
17 weeks between 24 December 2003 and 14 April 2004 (i.e. account weeks, 39-03.
inclusive). I examined every transaction aver the critical periad when the losses being
incurred were at their greatest. The purpase af my analysis was to independently
check the arithmetical accuracy of thase accounts, the average volume and value of
the transactions at the Marine Drive branch during this period, the average cash
usage, the cash ordering cycle and identifying any transactional areas that were
outside the mean average value for the bane i.e. whether there was anything unusual
for this particular branch. A spreadsheet showing the results of my analysis is at page
23.

10. I visited the Marine Drive branch on 28 June 2004, to investigate those transactions
that I had identified as being outside the average value. I analysed a Giro Business
Customer's cash deposits that were made inte the branch. Each cash deposit was then
was recorded correctly in line with our operating instructions and brought to account
through the Horizon system on the day the cash was deposited. ¥ aiso carried out a
number of further checks irr relatiorr to the receipts available at the branch to prove
that ttre finat totals accurately and correctty appearect ir the enc of week accounts. E
checked a number of daity records that were available in the branch to confirm their
arithmetical correctness and that they had beer correctly recorded onta the Horizon
system. Again, these. were. pravext ta be correct.

11. Lasked Ms Oglesby, then the Retail Line Manager, why the advice she had given to Mr
Castleton had not been followed by him and any reason as to why such losses were
consistently dismissed by Mr Castleton as. being @ fault with the Horiaom syskem. 1
understand that Ms Oglesby had. advised Mr Castleton to prepare bakances every day.
Ms Oglesby advised me that Mr Castleton was loath ta take her advice, dismissed any
suggestion that there might be problem that could possibly be theft related and
persisted with the presurnptior that alt shortages were as a result of the computer
System. 1 was surprisesk that. Me Castierom repesiediy dismissed the advice of an
experienced Post Office manager given that he was a relatively new Subpostmaster
and significant losses were accumulating in the Marine Drive branch.

12.1 conducted a daily transactional analysis from both daily and weekly balance
snapshots in the cash accounts of weeks 46, 47 and 50 in which there were losses of
£8,243.10, zero and £10,653.11 respectively (page 24). My analysis showed that there
were anomaties between the cash deciared on each Tuesday of those weeks and the
final cash declaration on the Wednesday at the final balance. For example, I evaluated
individual transactions between Tuesday 10" February 2004 and Wednesday 11”
February 2004 for cash account week 46. My evaluation indicated that the actual
transactional receipts exceeded? those payments thet were declared by the Marine
Drive Branch by approximately £15,300. It can be demonstrated that a cash deposit
of £16,500 by customer number 685 9461 was received on Wednesday 11° February
2004, but this is not reflected in the final cash declaration at the close of business on
the Wednesday. A cash declaration of approximately £49,000 should have been made
as opposed to the incorrect cash declaration that was actually made of £33,100. In
other words, the Marine Drive branch physically received approximately £15,300 more
cash that the amount it actually declared.

13.1 again visited the Marine Drive branctr avr 30 June 2004 ta track the Giro Bank
business deposits that the branch received and to establish the flow of cash into the
branch. The Marine Drive branch holds the account book for a customer account
number 6859461 who regularly deposited significant volumes of cash eactr
Wednesday. I analysed alt of that customer's depasits since November 2003 to confirm
that the deposits bad been brought to account. | double checked the cash account
weeks of 46, 47 and 50 where I had carried out @ daily transactional analysis, to
establish whether the levels of cash that had been declared had actually been received
from this customer: My analysis showed that faise cash declarations had beer made,
because the cash usage that occurred in the weeks 46, 47 and 50 was not reflected in
the finat cash cectared by the Marine Drive branch upon comptetion of the balance. In
other words, the cash that the Marine Drive branch physically received from this
customer was not reflected in the cash that Mr Castleton declared in each of the weeks
accounted. for.

14.1 made enquiries of Network Business Support Centre (NSBC) and the Horizon
Systenrs Heiptine (HSH) arc analysed the telephone records held by therr to check
not close due to running out of cash. My enquiries revealed that tests had satisfactorily
been carried out on the Horizon system which confirmed its integrity.

The Appest teawiesy ose 2 Judy 200%.

15. I presided over Mr Castleton’s Appeal Hearing on 1 July 2004. Mr Castleton had a
representative present, Mrs Julie Langham. Miss Paul Carmichael of the Post Office was

also there to take a note of the Hearing.

16. During the Hearing, Mr Castleton blamed the Horizon computer system for the losses.
The Horizon Systerm is am on-tine accounting system that is integrated into over
17,000 Post Office branches which provides the highest level of security and integrity
for the Past Office and aur clients with those transactions. The system provides for
on-line reconciliation of all our customer transactions and the Post Office weekly

POL00071231
POL00071231
bekawee. It records af volume and valves of transactions taking place at the brave.
These trawsactions crust be physically entered onto the system by the user wher a
customer presents a transaction at the Post Office counter. Each counter position has a
computer terminal, a visual display unit, a keyboard, barcode scanner and printer.
This system records att transactions inputted by the counter clerk working at that
counter pasitian. Each user has a unique pass word and identifier to enable the
system to have both internal and external security. Once logged on, any transactions
performed by the user must be recorded and entered on the computer. The system
reconciles the daily and weekly transactions and provides the weekly Post Office
halance. The onus is on the operator to check and confirm the value of the stock and
cash that is on hand when completing the balance. The system also allows for
information to be transferred to the main accounting department at Chesterfield in
order for accounts for each Post Office branct to be balanced.

17. However, Mr Castleton was unable to provide any evidence to support his assertion.
Furthermore, neither Fujitsu Services (whe were responsible for designing,
implementing and operating the Horizon system), nor the Horizon System Helpdesk
had beer: able te identify any problems wittr tie systerr. In any event, Mr Castietorr
stated that the cash declarations he had made (i.e. the accuracy of the cash that he
declared onto the systent and ultimately the cash accounts that he signed} were
accurate “nine times out of ten”. Mr Castleton stated that he knew how much to order
based on amounts previously ordered and Chrissie’s (his assistant) experience.

18. | explained to Mr Castleton thak beiween weeks 42 and 49 inclusive the Masine Drive:
branch had ordered significantly rrore cash from the Post Office than had normally
been the case. Mr Castleton stated that he only ordered what he felt was required. 1
informed Mr Castietorr that for this entire period (cash account weeks 42 ta 49) the
actual cash usage for transactions at the branch did not. differ from: weels te weele ack
he had only actually needed to order hetween £200,000 ta £265,006 in cash. Emstead,
Mr Castleton had ordered £305,000 of which only £20,000 had been returned.

19. My analysis of the increases im cash ordered by the branch demonstrated thar the:
branch did not need to order these excessive amounts of cash, because they were nat
required to serve the transactions that were being performed. Significantly, the orders
for extra cash were always in weeks where there was reported to be a significant loss
at the branch.

20. The Marine Drive branch never ran out of cash. If the Horizon system had been
incorrect and the cash shortfalls merely theoretical (i.e. camputer generated}, rather
than actual, there would always have been sufficient cash in the Marine Drive branch
to meet its requirements and no need to order extra cash. Crucially, it was only the
ordering of the extra cash that ensured that the branch was always able to remain
trading. Mr Castleton was unable to explain why he needed actual additional cash or

POL00071231
POL00071231
where that additional casir hut gamer if there mas only @ commpeter gererated,
theoretical shortfail.

21. If Mr Castietan’s assertion was correct, this would not have affected the physical
amount of cash at the Marine Drive. branch ar mean that Mr Castleton had to arder and
use extra cash. Mr Castleton specifically stated that he only ordered the cash he felt
was required.

Post Appeat Heoring Enquiries:

22. After the Appeal Hearing, I did @ further check with) Chery! Woodward of transaction
processing which confirmed that there were no ather autstanding error notices in the

system.

23. At the appeal heaving, Mr Castleton requested that further analysis be conducted on
certain Horizon balance printouts. I wrote to him on S July 200¢ to confirm that I
would obtain the analysis and endeavour to confirm my decision on 14 July 2004
(pages 28 and 29). Accordingly, I gave the Horizon finat account declarations to the
Network Development Manager, Anita Turner, who had no previous knowledge of the
case amt askect her ta conduct her awrr imteperctertt analysis of the lasses anc
movernents in the susperse account between cash account weeks 45 and 50. I wrote
to Mr Casttetan on 8 July 2004 to confirm the result of Ms Turner’s analysis (page 32).
Her analysis showed that:

(a) For the week ending 12 February 2004 (cash account week 46), the Marine Drive
branch declared a shartage discrepancy of £8,243.10.

() For the week ending 19 February 2004 (cask account weele 47), the Marine Drive
branch opened a suspense account amd transferrext the shortage discrepancy of
£8,243.10.

{c} For the week ending 26 February 2004, (case acount week 48) the Marine Drive
branch declared a shortage discrepancy of £3,509.18.

(d) For the week ending 4 March 2005 (cash account week 49), the Marine Drive
branch transferred the shortage discrepancy from week 48 of £3,509.18 to the
suspense account. The branch then declared a further shortage of £3,512.26.

(e} For the week ending II March 2004, (cash account week 50) the Marine Drive
branch did not transfer the shortage discrepancy of £3,512.26 to the suspense
account, but it was instead rolled over to week 50 without being made good.

POL00071231
POL00071231
24 lip or about late Rmefeariy Ady 2006 arnt S July 2004, Mr Castleton wrote to me agains
{pages 30 to 31 anc 34 to 37). However, I do not recall seeing those letters at the
time, which: may be because they were sent to the Darlington Area Office rather than
Caitharpe Hause, Londan where | was warking at the time.

Factors affecting my decision to dismiss Mr Castieton’s Appeal

25. The decision to dismiss Mr Castleton’s appeal was not taken lightly. A list of the factors
affecting my decision are at pages 9 and 10. I conducted extensive analysis on the
accounting documentation made available for the Appeal as well as the transactional
records at the Marie Drive branch. The Post Office's Transaction Processing
Department only had three error notices, all of which were accounted for. The cash
ordered by the Marine Drive branch was significantly outside the mean average value
that it normally ordered. The cash ordered was systematically increased on four
occasions, following which a large cash discrepancy occurred.

26. The Marine Drive branch incurred unprecedented declared losses over a 12 week
period in respeet of which Mr Castieton could only offer the explanation that it was the
Horizon System that was causing the errors. If the Horizon system was erroneously
dectaring tosses in the branch, there wautc have beer na actual castr shortfatts arc
there would always be sufficient amounts of cash in the branch to service is
requirements. However, Mr Castleton ordered extra cash and it was only this extra
cash which enabled the branch to continue to trade and meant that it never rar out.
Mc Castleton was. unable to explain why he required. additional cash if there was.anly a
system error. His argument that there was a system error was unfounded, but was in.
any event, academic. The physical need for extra cash can only be explained by the
fact that cash was jost.

27. Fujitsu Services’ checks indicated that the branch had made false cash declarations
and this was further corroborated with the daily account analysis. My analysis of the
weekly accounts show that the Marine Drive branch needed approxirrately £200,000 te
£265,000 to meet its transaction or requirements, between weeks 42 and. 42, but had
ordered £305,000 in cash to cover this period in respect of which only £20,000 was
returned. It was significant that additional cash was ordered prior to a subsequent
cash discrepancy being declared. Mr Castleton was not able to explain why such sums
of cash were ordered that were in excess of what was actually required and where it

had gone.

28. There were and have not been since any subsequent error notices for the branch under
Mr Castleton's operation, nor any similar experiences of large shortages by a number
of locum Subpostmasters who have all operated the same pieces of Horizon kit, week

in week out.

POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231

29. In the circumstances, I believe that the decision ultimately to dismiss Mr Castleton was
soundly based and accordingly I dismissed his Appeal. I wrote to Mr Castleton on 9
July 2004 to confirm my decision (page 38). I firmly believe not only that there is a
very real prospect that the Post Office will succeed if allowed to defend the
Counterclaim, but also that the arguments advanced by Mr Castleton hold no credence
whatsoever.

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.

Summary of Claim and Defence and Counterclaim

POL00071231
4. The Defendai
Office at | . GRO ee | (the Marine Drive
branch) from approximately 18 July 2003 to 23 March 2004. Mr Castleton
accepts that the express terms of his Contract for services included that he would
be strictly responsible for the safe custody of cash and stock, was obliged to make

good all losses caused through his own negligence, carelessness or error and
losses of any kind caused by his assistants and that his responsibility did not cease
when he relinquished his appointment and that he remains obliged to make good
any losses incurred during his term of office which subsequently came to light.

5. Between 18 July 2003 and 25 March 2004, net losses of £25,858.95 occurred at
the Marine Drive Branch. The Post Office seek repayment of those losses together
with interest and costs.

6. Mr Castleton’s case is that any shortfall is entirely the fault of problems with the
Horizon computer and accounting system at Marine Drive branch and that the Post
Office wrongfully terminated his Contract in respect of which he has suffered loss
not exceeding £250,000. i” °

Disclosure

7. By a Consent Order.dated 9 March 2006, standard disclosure was due to take
place by 18 May 2006 with inspection 7 days thereafter. By consent, the Post
Office agreed to extend the deadline for exchange of list of documents to 19 May
2006 and exchange of lists took place then.

8. 1 wrote to Mr Castleton’s solicitors, Rowe Cohen, to seek copies of Mr Castleton’s
disclosure on 25:May, 6, 8, 16, 21 June, 14, 25 and 31 July, 3 and 23 August, 5
and 12 September 2006. Copies of the inter-parties correspondence between
Bond Pearce and Rowe Cohen at pages to ey have now received most but not
all of Mr Castleton‘s disclosure. Currently we are awaiting copies of items 1, 2, 58,
62, 76 and 77 from Mr Castleton’s disclosure list, being the following:

1. Daily cash declarations for week 41 (2 January 2004) to week S1 (11
March 2004);

2. Weekly suspense account reports relating to weeks 47 and 49;

12. In any event, one of the Post Office potential witnesses, Ruth Simpson, who was
the relief sub-postmaster who took over immediately following Mr Castleton’s
suspension, is currently recovering from an operation and has not been available
for me to meet to take evidence. Given that and given that disclosure has been
protracted, it has not been possible to finalise witness statements in the timetable

originally envisaged.

Expert’s Reports

13. Although Mr Castleton has made various allegations about the computer system, it
is difficult to understand at this stage precisely how he says that any computer
errors caused the shortfalls. The cost of experts’ reports is likely to be significant.
For example, the Post Office’s accountancy expert has stated that their anticipated
costs could be in the region of £62,000 plus VAT. This-is because this would need
to cover a substantial amount of ground. Invorder to help reduce the cost of
experts’ reports and so:that the Post Office's experts’ reports can be focused on
particular allegations raised by Mr Castleton, we would prefer there to be a
sequential exchange: of experts’ reports, with Mr Castleton serving any expert

evidence in the. fields of computing and accountancy first.

Venue

14. Given that the Post Office claim is for £25,858.95 plus interest and costs. I believe
that it would be more appropriate for this case to be tried at the County Court
rather than the High Court. Accordingly, on 24 August 2006 I wrote to Mr

Castleton’s solicitors and invited them to agree to the transfer of the claim to the

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.

Summary of Claim and Defence and Counterclaim

1A1215575_1 1
4, The Defendant, Mr Castleton was a Sub-| Postmaster at the branch of the Post
Office at _ ~ “GRO ~ 4 (the Marine Drive
branch) from approximately 18 July 2003 to 23 March 2004. Mr Castleton
accepts that the express terms of his Contract for services included that he would

be strictly responsible for the safe custody of cash and stock, was obliged to make
good all losses caused through his own negligence, carelessness or error and
losses of any kind caused by his assistants and that his responsibility did not cease
when he relinquished his appointment and that he remains obliged to make good
any losses incurred during his term of office which subsequently came to light.

5. Between 18 July 2003 and 25 March 2004, net losses. of £25,858.95 occurred at
the Marine Drive Branch. The Post Office seek repayment of those losses together
with interest and costs.

6. Mr Castleton’s case is that any shortfall is entirely the fault of problems with the
Horizon computer and accounting system at Marine Drive branch and that the Post
Office wrongfully terminated his Contract in respect of which he has suffered loss
not exceeding £250,000.

Disclosure

7. By a Consent Order dated 9 March, 2006, standard disclosure was due to take
place by 18 May 2006 with inspection 7 days thereafter. By consent, the Post
Office agreed to extend the deadline for exchange of list of documents to 19 May
2006 and tegt exchange of list,took place then.

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF HELEN ROSE

I, HELEN ROSE (nee Hollingworth) of I:
WILL SAY AS#OLLOWS:

1. I am currently an Investigatigns Manager for the Post Office Limited (“the Post
Office”) and have been an Ifvestigations Manager since September 2004. Prior to
that, I was an auditor at/the Post Office for 5 years since August 1999. I have
worked for the Post Offige for over 9 years since approximately February 1997.

Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless
otherwise stated/I have had the benefit of reading through the audit papers.
References to #age numbers in this Witness Statement are to page numbers of
Exhibit “HR2”Ao this Witness Statement.

3. Asan Augitor, I was responsible for auditing Post Office Branches. I usually carried

out at Jeast 1 audit every day, although sometimes it could be closer to 2 or 3
and on 1 occasion I remember that I did 4 audits. I would therefore

WA A221 1
colleague Chris Taylor. We arrived at approximately 8.00 a.m. I had not had any
previous involvement with the Marine Drive Branch.

5. The process of carrying out the audit involves physically counting the cash and
stock at the Marine Drive branch, checking the paperwork such as Giro deposits
and withdrawal receipts, Pensions and Allowances Reports and where appropriate,
declared cash receipts.

6. Mr Castleton explained that he had been having problems balancing the books and
that those problems had started in the cash account week ending 43 (21 January
2004) with a shortfall of £4,230.97. Mr Castleton was adamant that the
misbalances were due to a computer problem and that no members of his staff
could be committing theft. In my considerable experience as an auditor, I have
never personally come across any computer problem generating cash shortfalls
and Mr Castleton’s explanation sounded completely implausible to me.

7. The handwritten notes of the audit are at pages 1 to 47 and a typed copy of the
audit is at pages 48 to 64. A copy of the conclusion of my report is at page 65. In
short, I concluded that there were unauthorised losses of £25,758.75. This was a
result of unauthorised losses that had accumulated in the cash account and it had
been transferred to the suspense account for many weeks leading up to the audit.
(For clarification I should confirm that the report is erroneously dated 25 rather
than 23 March 2004. I believe that the audit took place on 23 March 2004 and
that this is a typographical error. The report also lists weeks 48 to 43 and their
figures twice and this is also simply a typographical error).

8. As part of an audit, we have to complete a procedural security inspection. This was
carried out by my colleague Chris Taylor. A typed copy of the procedural and
security inspection is at page 63. The inspection revealed that the safe was left
open, the safe keys were left in the safe door and it was not secured, that cash
and stock were not secured during lunchtime if the Sub-Postmaster was not on the
premises, that Travellers Cheques were not kept in the safe and Foreign Currency
was not held securely, that standard procedures for adjusting losses and gains
were not adhered to (because losses were unauthorised) and personal cheques on
hand had been incorrectly treated.

9. I do remember that Mr Castleton left the branch at lunchtime and returned in the
afternoon smelling strongly of alcohol.

10. I did not remove any documents from the Marine Drive branch during the audit. If

there were any documents that are required, 1 always ask the Sub-Postmaster to
print off his spare copy. I understand that one of the live issues in this case is

4A12421111 2

POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231

whether any balance snapshots were removed. A balance snapshot is a report that
contains what the computer believes is the total cash in stock figure. It looks at
the previous weeks’ declared cash in stock and adjusts items as they are sold, so if
someone forgets to enter an item that a customer has purchased, then the balance
snapshot figures will be inaccurate. I certainly do not recall removing any daily
balance snapshots and for the reason I have explained, they would not have been
particularly useful to me.

11. I was not involved with the case any further after completing the audit.

12. At page 65 is a Former Subpostmasters Accounts Statement of Outstanding Debt
as at 11 February 2005. [Helen, do you know how these statements are
generated?) This shows that the outstanding indebtedness (excluding interest)
is £25,858.95. This is slightly different to the figure of £25,758.75 on the audit
because the following error notices (copies attached) that occurred on 23 March
2004 were not issued until after the audit had taken place:

(a) £176 lottery charge error (i.e. an error notice against the
subpostmaster) (pages ); and

(b) £75.80 lottery claim error (i.e. an error notice in favour of the
subpostmaster) (pages ).

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.

WITNESS STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH MORGAN

GRO {WELL

I, ELIZABETH MORGAN, ot
SAY AS FOLLOWS:

1. Iam currently a Rural Support Manager for Post Office Limited (the Post Office) and have held this
position since January 2005. From May 2002 to March/April 2004, I worked as an advisor in the Post
Office Suspense Account team. I have worked for the Post Office for over 27 years and 15 of those

were as an auditor.

2. I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.

The Suspense Account Team

3. The Suspense Account Team’s role was to determine whether to permit postmasters to temporarily
transfer a shortfall from their cash account to suspense account and to try to reduce across the
business the amounts being transferred by post office branches into suspense account.

4. Ifa branch incurs unauthorised losses then at the material time (December 2003 to March 2004) they
would have usually called the NBSC helpline and sought permission to transfer the loss into a
suspense account. The NBSC would refer the matter to the Suspense Account team who would call
the subpostmaster back to ascertain whether they could explain the precise reason for the
discrepancy. The subpostmaster might be given permission to transfer the shortfall from the Cash
Account to the Suspense Account where it could legitimately remain for up to 8 weeks provided
either:

(a) they provided a sufficiently detailed and acceptable explanation for the discrepancy;

(b) they submitted a hardship form which showed that they could not afford to make good the

shortfall in the cash account; or

POL00071231
POL00071231

' De af A 8

(c) exceptionally, their Retail Line Manager (RLM) authorised it. a er

5. If they obtained permission to transfer the loss into suspense account, they were also given an
authorisation code (being the NBSC call log number) and were supposed to write that number on their
Cash Account.

6. There was in fact nothing to prevent the subpostmaster transferring a shortfall in the Cash Account to
the Suspense Account without permission, although they were not supposed to do this.

7. If a subpostmaster transferred a shortfall into the Suspense Account, the shortfall would still show in
any balance snapshot printed after the transfer until after they balanced the following week. This
sometimes caused subpostmasters to at first mistakenly believe that they had not transferred the
shortfall from the Cash Account to the Suspense Account even though they had.

My involvement

8. I vaguely remember speaking to Mr Castleton on the telephone probably in or around February or
March 2004 and that he stated he did not know “what was going on” (meaning he did not know why

he was incurring losses). beclyip .

9. In or around May 2004, I was asked by Catherine Oglesby (who at the time was Mr Castleton’s RLM)
to examine various Cash Accounts she sent to me for! GRO

(the Marine Drive branch). Given the amount of time that has passed since I examined them, I
cannot now remember which weeks or what specifically it was in the Cash Accounts that I looked at.

However, given that at the time I was used to carrying out this exercise for RLMs, I believe that I
would have reviewed the figures in the Stock, Receipts and Payments in the Cash Accounts. I would
have looked for anything unusual such as at whether particular figures varied significantly from week
to week in the Cash Accounts or whether they were unusual for the type of transaction concerned. I

FOLLOWS:

1. Iam currently an Area Intervention Manager Area for Post Office Limited (the Post Office) and have
held this position since June 2005. From January 2004 I worked on the Network Reinvention

worked as an advisor in the Post Office Suspense Account team. I have worked for the Post Office
since 1990. I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise

2. The Suspense Account Team’s role was to determine whether to permit postmasters to temporarily
transfer a shortfall from their cash account to suspense account and to try to reduce across the
business the amounts being transferred by post office branches into suspense account.

3. In or around May 2004, I was asked by my colleague Elizabeth Morgan to examine various Cash
Accounts she had received from Catherine Oglesby (who at the time I am informed was Mr Castleton’s

what exactly it was in the Cash Accounts or which weeks that I looked at. However, at the time I was

WITNESS STATEMENT OF GREGORY JOHN BOOTH

have
worked at Newby branch for 1 year (the first 6 months as-tempurary Manager, the last 6 months as
-permanent Manager). I have worked in Post Office branches for the past 8 years. I was
subpostmaster of Edgehill branch from October 1998 to September 2003. I was temporary
subpostmaster for Southcliffi¢ branch from September 2003 to February 2004. Before working in Post
Office branches, I was an accountantyin audit for Coopers and Lybrand (as PriceWaterhouseCoopers

was then known).

2. I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.
References to page numbers in this Witness statement are to page numbers of Exhibit “GB1” to this
Witness Statement.

3. From 21 April 2004 to 28 May 2004 (just over 5 weeks) I was the temporary subpostmaster at 14
(the Marine Drive branch). I was asked by Catherine
Oglesby, then the 0 be the new temporary subpostmaster because Ruth
Simpson, who was the temporary subpostmaster before me, could not continue in the position any

etail Line Manager,

longer due to other commitments she had.

Assistant

4. Subposmasters decide whether they need to employ an assistant. I employed Joan Train as my part
time assistant whilst I was the temporary subpostmaster at the Marine Drive branch. Joan Train
worked 2 or 3 days per week. As far as I was aware, she had not previously worked at the Marine
drive branch, but had just left another branch in Bridlington on Quay Road.

5. Joan Train was coincidentally the mother in law of Mr Castleton’s assistant Christine Train. Christine

Train had been employed by Mr Castleton to work behind the counter whilst he was subpostmaster,

Cash accounts

7. The Cash accounts for the period when I worked as a subpostmaster are at pages [ ]. In summary,

they show that:

(a) Cash Account week 5, week ended 28 April 2004 surplus of £14.26
(b) Cash Account week 6, week ended 5 May 2004, surplus £103.11 (I will explain the reason for this

9. Catherine Oglesby contacted me around 5 May 2004 and told me that Mr Castleton had also spoken to
her about the suspense account and she wanted to test whether it was in fact doubling up the losses.

I told her that I was a few pounds over so far that week. Ms Oglesby asked me to print an office
snapshot (pages ) which shows that the cash was £41,777.87. She then asked me to transfer £100
into the shortages line on the suspense account which I did and then to print a second snapshot
(pages ) and a suspense account report (pages ). The £100 was in the correct place and the cash
figure had reduced by £100 to £41,665.53 (in fact, it had reduced slightly more than this due to an
unrelated transaction(s) performed before the snapshot was printed). This appeared to show that the

system was working correctly.

10. Ms Oglesby asked me to balance with those amounts still in the account as I should balance £100
over. She said she would then call me a few days later and ask me to transfer the £100 out off the
suspense account, to see if the opposite occurred. I balanced later that day and left Ms Oglesby a
message on her telephone to confirm that I had balanced £100 over, as expected.

11. On 7 May 2004 Ms Oglesby visited me at the Marine Drive branch. She asked me to firstly print an
office snapshot (pages ), then to remove the £100 from the suspense account which I did, then to
print a second snapshot (pages ) and a suspense account report (pages ). Again the cash figure in
the snapshot had changed by £100 which suggested that the system worked correctly.

The two computers

12.1 have been asked to confirm whether I experienced certain problems with the Horizon computer
terminals whilst I was the temporary subpostmaster at the Marine Drive branch. Given-that-it-has

13. I have been asked whether any of the computer equipment was changed whilst I was at the Marine
Drive branch. I certainly do not remember any being changed at the time and do not believe that it

was.

Car auction deposits

14. There was one thing at the Marine Drive branch that struck me as being highly | at the time. A
car auction in Bridlington would usually deposit around £15,000 to £20,000 in cash each week in one
or two tranches. It was by far the largest amount that the Marine Drive branch would receive in cash
deposits each week. The cash would usually be left with Mr Castleton in the shop early in the morning

before the Post Office counter opened. It was left in a bag or boxes and there was no covering note

stating how much cash there was: it was simply left to the Marine Drive branch to count and to pay
into the customer’s girobank account. The paying in book was kept permanently behind the Post
Office counter whereas it should have been retained by the customer. Not wanting to upset the
relationship with the customer, I did not raise my concerns about this with them or with Mr Castleton.

29 May 2004 onwards

15. I was unable to continue as temporary subpostmaster at the Marine Drive branch beyond 28 May
2004 because I had prior relief work booked. After I left, Dorothy Day took over as subpostmaster
and worked at the branch with her husband.

16. In around late September 2004, Mr Oglesby contacted me to ask me if I would act as relief
subpostmaster at the Marine Drive branch again presumably because at the time, it was thought that
Dorothy Day was not going to continue in the role. She sent to me the contract papers. After
speaking to Ms Oglesby I received 2 or 3 telephone calls from Mr Castleton. He explained that he did
not want me to go back to the Marine Drive branch because he wanted to keep Dorothy Day as the
customers had become used to her. He said he would make it difficult and very expensive for me if 1

went back, and.that-semething-might-heppen-te-rmy-cartebh threaten.

17. The barrister of Mr Castleton’s father in law Allan then telephoned me to say that the business was
being purchased by Allan’s pension fund and it was therefore his duty to ensure a proper rate of
return which in his opinion would require rent for the Marine Drive branch of £1,250 per month. That
would make it uneconomic to run. Given that and the problems Mr Castleton said would crop up if I
returned, I decided to decline Ms Oglesby’s offer. She asked me to confirm this in writing to her
which I did on 3 October 2004 (page).  f tn il Rent hab seat Anat, By is Pry

WITNESS STATEMENT OF GREGORY JOHN BOOTH

1, GREGORY JOHN BOOTH, o! (WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

} Ihave

1. I am currently the Manager of the Newby Post Office branch,
worked at Newby branch for 1 year (the first 6 months as temporary Manager, the last 6 months as

permanent Manager). I have worked in Post Office branches for the past 8 years. I was
subpostmaster of Edgehill branch from October 1998 to September 2003. I was temporary
subpostmaster for Southcliffe branch from September 2003 to February 2004. Before working in Post
Office branches, I was an accountant in audit for Coopers and Lybrand (as PriceWaterhouseCoopers

was then known).

2. I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.

Simpson, who was the temporary subpostmaster before me, could not continue in the position any

longer due to other commitments she had.

but whilst I was there, she worked in the shop rather than behind the Post Office counter. Mr
Castleton also worked in the shop. I think someone else may have worked bébir@ either behind the
Post Office counter or shop whilst Mr Castleton was subpostmaster but who was not kept on after he
was suspended. [what makes you think this?]

6. Whilst Joan Train was working and serving customers we would each use a separate computer
terminal. At the Marine Drive branch they are a shared stock unit so all the transactions done on the
two computers are pooled into one shared stock and cash account. During Joan Train’s days off, I
would log on to both computer terminals and serve customers from both of them. This enabled me

they show that:

WITNESS STATEMENT OF MICHAEL JOHNSON

WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

I am employed by Post Office Limited (the Post Office) as a Postal Officer in the Lottery Exceptions
Team. I have worked for the Post Office for Pea years and in this particular team for the past 12
years. My role includes recovering money for the Post Office in relation to lottery errors.

/
I make this Witness Statement from shcts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.
References to page numbers in this Withess statement are to page numbers of Exhibit “MJ1” to this
Witness Statement. f

I do not believe that I was involved with the branch at Le ; GRO - H
(the Marine Drive branch) or/this matter at the material time (December 2003 to April 2004). I
have been asked simply to pryvide an overview for the benefit of the Court of what happened at the
material time when a Post Office customer buys a National Lottery ticket.
A

I am informed that the National Lottery terminal at the Marine Drive branch is in the shop on the
premises as opposed t# behind the Post Office counter. Basically, the customer would choose their
lottery numbers, seleét which lottery draws they wished to enter and pay the shop clerk for their
lottery ticket, whichAvould be printed by the lottery terminal.

Each lottery terr#inal has its own unique retailer number. Every time a ticket is sold, the details of
the transaction“at that terminal are automatically downloaded to Camelot within, I am informed, 7

seconds of the transaction taking place.

After close of business each day, the branch should print out two summaries from the lottery terminal
of all transactions done at that terminal: one is an on-line summary; the other is an instant summary.
(The post office branch should keep these for 2 years). The summaries show what the lottery receipts
were and any prize money paid out that day. The time and date of the printout is included on the

1A_1209645_2 1
POL00071231
POL00071231

summaries. In relation to lottery scratchcard packs that are activated on the lottery terminal, a pink
activation slip is produced each time a pack is activated. These slips should also be retained by the
post office branch for 2 years. Each pack that is activated should be remmed in i.e. recorded by the
subpostmaster or their assistant on to their computer, the same day as the activation. Where
premises have a Post Office counter within a shop, (and I am informed that the Marine Drive branch
does have a shop), the shop will often stay open later than the Post Office counter. In that case, the
shop will continue selling lottery tickets after the Post Office counter has closed and consequently, the
subpostmaster will use the shop till receipts to simply input the details of the lottery transactions into
their Horizon computer terminal the next day before open of business.

7. At the end of the cash account week, the value of all the lottery transactions done through the lottery
terminal should agree with the totals shown in the weekly cash account that the subpostmaster
completes, signs and sends to Chesterfield. These weekly cash accounts must include all transactions
done outside of post office hours, in other words, Thursday morning through to the following
Wednesday evening.

8. Camelot electronically send a daily text file to the Post Office, Chesterfield, which contains details of
the transactions for every retailer number. Each week those figures are totalled and were at the
material time posted automatically by the Post Office into the Counters Business Database. This
information is automatically compared to the information received on the Horizon system from each
branch to see whether there are any discrepancies between the two.

9. If there was a discrepancy, the computer would have details of the branch code, the week, year, the
type of product (i.e. in this case, lottery) and whether it is a claim error (in the branch’s favour) or a
charge error (against the branch). wee cee ~~ padlls ical ke

Sea Slaern bleor zen + ONS OO aren

10. The Lottery Exceptions Team would usually then try to call the branch before issuing an error notice, ._ .
particularly if there were several discrepancies or a discrepancy for a significant amount, to try to hea
understand whether there is an explanation that could explain the discrepancy. An error notice is a
formal notification to a branch advising of a mistake made and giving instructions on how to rectify
the situation in their accounts. The error notice is sent to the branch in question and the postmaster

is required to bring the error to account before the end of the next cash account period.

11. I have been shown a spreadsheet for the Marine Drive branch which shows that there were 16 errors
brought to account for 2003 to 2004 (page 1). 10 of these were for lottery error notices as follows:
t
(a) 3 _stfor notices dated 7 October 2003 which were for £271, £731 and £160 charge errors
_fagainst the subpostmaster in respect of discrepancies that occurred in cash account weeks 19,
21 and 22 respectively. ely. The schedule e shows that errors were all brought to account on 15

October 2003. @Brought to account” is when the ‘subpostmaster is sent an error notice ont
‘nenters-the-detalls into his Cash Account).

(b) Error notice dated 7 October 2003 which was for a £160 claim error in favour of the
subpostmaster in respect of a discrepancy that occurred in the cash account week 20. The
schedule shows that error was brought to account on 15 October 2003.

, é
(c) 2 error notices dated 8 October 2006jwhich were for £227 and £628 claim errors in favour of

the subpostmaster in respect of discrepancies that occurred in cash account weeks 19 and 21
respectively. The schedule shows that errors were brought to account on 15 October 200)

(d) 3 errors notice dated 16 January 2004 which were for £360, £520 and £534 charge errors

against the subpostmaster in respect of a discrepancies that occurred in cash account weeks
34, 24 and 25 respectively. The schedule shows that errors were brought to account on 21
January 2004.

(e) Error notice dated 16 January 2004 which was for a £65 claim error in favour the
subpostmaster in respect of a discrepancy that occurred in the cash account week 25. The
schedule shows that error was brought to account on 21 January 2004,

12. At pages 2 and 3 are details of a lottery error that occurred on 23 March 2004 for £176 that has not
been repaid. Calin vy 2 av ty,

13. I am informed that Mr Castleton contends that his Horizon computer terminals may not have recorded
or accurately recorded all the information inputted into them. If that was the case for the lottery,

then:

(a) the subpostmaster would have been able to see at the time that he prepared his weekly cash
account that the lottery information contained in it did not match the summary printed from
the lottery terminal; and

(b) when the text file sent by Camelot to the Post Office, Chesterfield was compared against the

information from Horizon, the two would not have matched and I would have expected to see

WITNESS STATEMENT OF GILLIAN HOYLAND

I, GILLIAN HOYLAND, of | GRO ___ WILL SaY As FoLLows:

1. I am employed by Post Office Limited (the Post Office) as a Postal Officer in the Cheques to
Processing Team. I have worked for the Post Office for 25 years and in this particular team for the
past 7 years. My role includes recovering money for the Post Office in relation to unprocessed

cheques.

2. I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.
References to page numbers in this Witness statement are to page numbers of Exhibit “GH1” to this
Witness Statement.

3. I wesdo not_believe that I was involved with the Marine Drive branch or this matter at the material
time (December 2003 to April 2004). I have been asked simply to provide an overview for the benefit
of the Court of what happened at the material time when a Post Office customer paid for a product or

service by cheque.

4. Basically, at the counter the customer would purchase whatever product(s) or service(s) they
required, write out a cheque for the appropriate amount and give it to the counter clerk. The counter
clerk would input the details of the transaction (including that it had been paid by cheque) on to their
computer terminal. They would then supply whatever product(s) and/or services(s) were required
and retain the cheque, manually recording what product(s) or service(s) had been supplied on the
back (such as a TV licence).

5. At the end of each day, the subpostmaster would print out a cheque listing report from their computer
which lists the quantity and amount of each cheque received that day. They would then manually

complete a Batch Control Voucher (BCV)-{page-23-1" ¥ ct ry" deharie

1A 12077632 2
POL00071231
POL00071231

office FAD code. The BCV states the number of cheques received that day and their total value. It
also contains the date stamp, the branch’s unique FAD code and address.

6. The branch would then retain their cheque listing report (which ought to be kept for 2 years) and at
the material time, send the BCV and cheques to Data Central in London where the BCV and cheques
were loaded on to a conveyor belt and automatically counted by machine. (The processing function
performed by Data Central was outsourced to the EDS Processing Centre, Shepshed, Leicestershire at
about the end March 2004 and Data Central no longer exists). The processed cheques would in due
course be sent to the clearing banks.

7. If the information contained in the BCV either:

(a) did not match the cheques, there was an “unbalanced match”; or

(b) matched the cheques, but the information the counter clerk inputted into Horizon does not
match this, there is a “balanced match”

10, ¢o}If_there were any discrepancies, the Cheque to Processing team in Chesterfield would
send a standard form to the branch to complete setting out their daily and/or weekly figures for the
cheques they had received. The form would contain the date, amount of the cheque and number of
cheques of that amount. An example of sveh-athe type of form_currently in use is at page 2

number of cheques received, amount received and any explanation and would send the form to the

POL00071231
POL00071231

12. 4@;The cheques to processing team would usually then try to call the branch in question and ask for
all the branches work the day before the BCV, the day of the BCV and the day after the BCV. If the
branch did not reply to the call, we would follow this up by letter. We would review the paperwork
received and either:

(a) If the paper work supplied by the branch supported the quantity and value of cheques
received, we would contact the customer and seek a replacement cheque;

(b) If, for example, the same cheque had been double counted by the branch, we would issue a
transaction correction i.e. an error notice; or

(c) If the evidence was inconclusive, the Post Office would write off the shortfall.

13. There could be a ciaim error {in favour of the subpostmaster) if, for example, they sent a
greater number of cheques and/or.or cheques. with.a.greater value to be processed by Data
Central, than they had recorded on the Horizon computer system. Conversely, there could
be_a.charge error (against the subpostmaster) if, for example, they sent fewer cheques
and/or cheques with a lower value to be processed by Data Central, than they had recorded
onthe Horizon computer system,

14.24--I have been shown a spreadsheet for the Marine Drive branch which shows that for_2003 to
2004 there were 15 errors that were brought to account (i.e. entered by the subpostmaster

hei ount) o} 24 of thos rrors were 22 brought to account for
2003-4 4-page-3and 1 was cancelled (page 5). Only 2 of these were cheque error notices, as

follows:

(a) Error notice dated 31 October 2003 which was for £56.94 charge against the subpostmaster in
respect of a discrepancy that occurred in the cash account week 13 August 2003. The
schedule shows that error was brought to account on 12 November 2003. (“Brought to
account” is when the subpostmaster is sent an error notice and enters the details into his
Cash Account. As it can take a while for an error notice to be generated, the subpostmaster
may not enter the error details into the Cash Account until many weeks after the error

occurred).

(b) Error notice dated 12 February 2004 which was for £862.32 charge against the subpostmaster
in respect of a discrepancy that occurred in the cash account week 17 September 2003. The
schedule shows that error was brought to account on 25 February 2004.

15, 42-1 am informed that Mr Castleton contends that his computer may not have recorded or accurately
recorded all the information inputted into it. If that was the case for cheques, then:

(a) the subpostmaster would have been able to see at the time that the daily cheque listing report
did not match the actual number and value of cheques they had received; and

(b) when the cheques and BCVs were processed by Data Central, this would not have matched

the information contained in Horizon and I would have expected to see a significant volume of
1A_1207763_2 4

POL00071231

error notices generated for the Marine Drive branch. There were in fact no error notices
generated at all for the cash account period January to March 2004 when I am informed that
the losses occurred at the branch.

(a) did not match the cheques, there was an “unbalanced match”; or

(b) matched the cheques, but the information the counter clerk inputted into Horizon does not

8. In those circumstances, I understand that Data Central’s procedure was to:

(a) check that the machine had correctly scanned the cheques i.e the words (for example, ten
pounds) and figures (for example, £10) on the cheques matched each other; and

(b) send a standard form to the branch to complete setting out their daily and/or weekly figures

you let me have an example of this sort of form?].

9. If the completed form matched the processed cheques, but not the BCV or the information on
Horizon, Data Central would then complete a form setting out details of the branch, amount of error,
BCV date, number of cheques claimed, amount claimed, number of cheques received, amount
received and any explanation and would send the form to the Cheques to Processing team to deal
with from that point onwards. An example of such a form is at page 3. Please can you fet me

have an example of this sort of form?
10. The cheques to processing team would usually then try to call the branch in question and ask for all
the branches work the day before the BCV, the day of the BCV and the day after the BCV. If the

branch did not reply to the call, we would follow this up by letter. We would review the paperwork

received and either:

(a) If the paper work supplied by the branch supported the quantity and value of cheques

correction i.e. an error notice; or

(c) If the evidence was inconclusive, the Post Office would write off the shortfall.

11.

a

I have been shown a spreadsheet for the Marine Drive branch which shows that there were 22 errors

brought to account for 2003 to 2004 (page 3). Only 2 of these were cheque error notices as follows:

12.1 am informed that Mr Castleton contends that his computer may not have recorded or accurately

WITNESS STATEMENT OF KENNETH A‘ N CRAWLEY

TWILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

I, KENNETH ALLAN CRAWLEY, of [

1. I am employed by Post Office Limited (the Post, ice) as a Postal Officer in the Current Agent Debt
Team. I have worked for the Post Office for 38 years and in this particular team for the past 3 years.
My role includes dealing with cases remaini#g from the Pensions and Allowances work carried out for

the (now) Department of Work and Pen:

2. I make this Witness Statement frofn facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.
References to page numbers in Thig/Witness statement are to page numbers of Exhibit “KAC1” to this
wes statement. f

ul pee Ae Cincy
at involved with the Marine Drive branch or this matter at the material time (December 2003
to neal 2004). I have beer asked simply to provide an overview for the benefit of the Court of what
happened at the material time when a Post Office customer collected their pension and/or allowance.

4. Basically, the custom¢gr would present their pension & allowance book to the counter clerk at the
branch. The countey clerk would input the details of the transaction on to their computer terminal.
They would then tgar out the counterfoil from the book, stamp the book and stamp the counterfoil.
The stamp contaigis the branch name and date and often a letter or symbol which would identify the
counter clerk who did the transaction. The counter clerk would then pay out the amount in cash to

the customer and retain the counterfoil as proof of payment.

5. At the end of each day, the subpostmaster would, at their discretion, print from their computer a daily
summary. This is not a procedural requirement but was a facility available to postmasters so they
could check their pensions and allowances on a daily basis (or other timescale of their choice) if they
so preferred. This would contain a summary of the amount of money that had been paid out to
customers by that branch that day for their pensions and allowances. The subpostmaster would check
the summary against the counterfoils to ensure they matched. A copy of the daily summary, if

printed, was retained in the office. I am informed that Mr Castleton contends that his computer may
1A_1209673_1 1
POL00071231
POL00071231

not have recorded or accurately recorded all the information inputted into it. If that was the case for
pensions and allowances, then if he printed the daily summary, he would have been able to see at the
time that it did not match the actual number and value of counterfoils received.

6. The branch also had to print a mandatory weekly summary called form P2311MA and send it each
week, together with the counterfoils to the Paid Order Unit (POU) at Lisahally in Northern Ireland,
Often bundles of foils would be “add-listed” by the postmaster. The “add-list” print out would be
wrapped around the foils to which they related - usually one per day (or other timescale of their
choice). The branch also had to send a further copy of the weekly summary form P2311MA to
Transaction Processing (now called Product and Branch Accounting) in Chesterfield.

Ur ose re ice fo cot

7. The POU is responsible for conducting manual checks of the paid foils received. If these checks reveal ~

any discrepancies (i.e. the amounts in the weekly summary and counterfoils do not match), the POU
will notify the Transaction Processing team by entering the details into their computer using software
called Pensions and Allowances Checking System (PACSYS). The information will include the branch
office code, week number, the week ending date, details of the error including value and category (for
example sickness benefit, income support, family credit) and any explanation for the error. The
information from PACSYS was downloaded weekly and automatically entered into the Counter
Business Database and any supporting documentation, such as the P2311MA form will be amended.

8. Transaction Processing would then arrange for an error notice to be issued. An error notice is a
formal notification to a branch advising of a mistake made and giving instructions on how to rectify
the situation in their accounts, The error notice is sent to the branch in question and the postmaster
is required to bring the error to account before the end of the next cash account period. Once the
error notice has been brought to account (i.e. entered by the subpostmaster into their cash account),
the error notice should be signed by the postmaster and returned to Transaction processing, together
with the weekly cash account. To my knowledge this process has been the same for a considerable

number of years.

9. There are however, certain occasions when discrepancies found by the POU are not dealt with in this
way. If certain criteria are met (i.e. the error was for over £80) and the discrepancies are not
believed to have been caused by genuine mistakes, the relevant documentation is forwarded to the
Post Office Limited Investigation Section. An error notice will then not be issued until completion of

i
10. I have been shown_a spreadsheet for the Marine Drive branch which shows that there were %2 error

notices issued, abo which were brought to account and one cancelled for 2003 to 2004 (page 1).
During this period, there was only 1 Pensions and Allowance error notice dated 5 September 2003

any investigation.

which was for £119.38 a charge against the subpostmaster in respect of a discrepancy that occurred
in the cash account week 30 July 2003. The schedule shows that error was brought to account on 22
September 2003.

occurred between weeks 42 and 51. I also checked the level of error notices that had

a holding account that is established following either the suspension or last day of

that branch, which have not been brought to account). Two smaller error notices
totalling £292 were also charged to the Late Account. I do not have the dates and
specific amounts for those errors totalling £292, but believe that they actually occurred
whilst Mr Castleton was the postmaster but had not been drawn to the attention of the
business until after he was suspended. As such Mr Castleton was liable for the errors

The Appeal Hearing on 1 July 2004 i wn pes. Ms is
15.1 presided over Mr Castieton’s Appeal Hearing on 1 July 2004. ‘Mr Castleton had a
representative present, Mrs Julie Langham, Miss Paul Carmichael of the Post Office was

also there to take a note of the Hearing.

16, During the Hearing, Mr Castleton blamed the Horizon computer system for the losses.
The Horizon System is an on-line © accqunting system that is integrated into over
17,000 Post Office branches which{provides the highest level of security and integrity
for the Post Office and our clients with those transactions. The system is like a
sophisticated electronic calculator for the Post Officeg, It provides for on-line
reconciliation of all our customer transactions and the Post Office weekly balance. It
records all volume and values of transactions taking place at the branch. These
transactions must be physically entered onto the system by the user when a customer
presents a transaction at the Post Office counter.

17. Each counter position has a computer terminal, a visual display unit, a keyboard,
barcode scanner and printer. This system records all transactions inputted by the
counter clerk working at that counter position. It can therefore only record what the
counter clerk types in. Each user has a unique pass word and identifier to enable the
system to have both internal and external security. Once logged on, any transactions
performed by the user must be recorded and entered on the computer. The system
reconciles the daily and weekly transactions and provides the weekly Post Office
balance. The onus is on the counter clerk to check and confirm the value of the stock
and cash that is on hand when completing the balance. The system also allows for
information to be transferred to the main accounting department at Chesterfield in
order for accounts for each Post Office branch to be balanced.

18. However, Mr Castleton was unable to provide any evidence to support his assertion.
Furthermore, neither Fujitsu Services (who were responsible for designing,
implementing and operating the Horizon system), nor the Horizon System Helpdesk
had been able to identify any problems with the system. In any event, Mr Castleton
stated that the cash declarations he had made (i.e. the accuracy of the cash that he
declared onto the system and ultimately the weekly cash accounts that he signed)
were accurate “nine times out of ten”. Mr Castleton stated that he knew how much to
order based on amounts previously ordered and Chrissie’s (his assistant) experience.

19. I had also carried out an analysis to track large bulk orders of usable cash moving in
and out of the branch to try to ascertain why the subpostmaster would order cash
outside the branch‘s normal requirements. This particular analysis focused on he
period in which significant losses occurred, being cash account week 42 (the week
ending 14 January 2004) to cash account wee! (the week ending 3 March 2004)
(John this is the period referred to in your appeal note as being the period
you discussed with Castleton and to which you attribute the figures below,
but in your 2 May email to me you said you analysed to the period 17 March
2004. To which period do the figures below relate? 4 or 17 March?] 1 was
interested in Marine Drive branch’s bulk cash ordering and not their orders of change

because the orders for change were largely accounted for through giro change orders
and the small coin requirements to service every day transactions.

20. I explained to Mr Castleton that between weeks 42 and 49 inclusive the Marine Drive
branch had ordered significantly more cash from the Post Office than had normally
been the case. Mr Castleton stated that he only ordered what he felt was required. I
informed Mr Castleton that for this entire period (cash account weeks 42 to 45) ‘the
actual cash usage for transactions at the branch did not differ from week to week and
he had only actually needed to order between £200,000 to £265,000 in cash. Instead,

Mr Castleton had £305,000 cash and of which only £20,000 usable cash was returned.

21. For clarification I should add that during that periodjthe Marine Drive branch actually
ordered £316,590 and returned £34,891.28, but this included unusable notes, foreign

notes, Scottish notes and coinage that is remitted on a weekly basis and the purpose
of my analysis was to track large bulk orders of usable cash moving in and out of the

branch. veh
oust
22. My analysis of the increases in cash ordered by the branch demonstrated that the
branch did not need to order these excessive amounts of cash, because they were not
required to serve the transactions that were being performed. Significantly, the orders
for extra cash were always in weeks where there was reported to be a significant loss
at the branch.

23. The Marine Drive branch never ran out of cash. If the Horizort system had been
incorrect and the cash shortfalls merely theoretical (i.e. compyter generated), rather
than actual, there would always have been sufficient cash inthe Marine Drive branch
to meet its requirements and no need to order extra cash¢ Crucially, it was only the
ordering of the extra cash that ensured that the branch was always able to remain
trading. Mr Castleton was unable to explain why he needed actual additional cash or
where that additional cash had gone if there was only a computer generated,
theoretical shortfall.

24. If Mr Castleton’s assertion was correct, this would not have affected the physical
amount of cash at the Marine Drive branch or mean that Mr Castleton had to order and
use extra cash. Mr Castleton specifically stated that he only ordered the cash he felt

was required.
Post Appeal Hearing Enquiries

25. After the Appeal Hearing, I did a further check with Cheryl Woodward of transaction
processing which confirmed that there were no other outstanding error notices in the

system. SS %o ae becke (rea F

26. At the appeal hearing, Mr Castleton requested that further analysis be conducted on
certain Horizon balance printouts. I wrote to him on 5 July 2004 to confirm that I
would obtain the analysis and endeavour to confirm my decision on 14 July 2004
(pages 28 and 29). Accordingly, I gave the Horizon final account declarations to the Ren
Network Development Manager, Anita Turner, who had no previous knowledge of the
case and asked her to conduct her own independent analysis of the losses and
movements in the suspense account between cash account weeks 45 and 50. I wrote
to Mr Castleton on 8 July 2004 to confirm the result of Ms Turner’s analysis (page 32).
Her analysis showed that:
POL00071231

POL00071231

(a) For the week ending 12 February 2004 (cash account week 46), the Marine Drive
branch declared a shortage discrepancy of £8,243.10.

(b) For the week ending 19 February 2004 (cash account week 47), the Marine Drive
branch opened a suspense account and transferred the shortage discrepancy of
£8,243.10.

(c) For the week ending 26 February 2004, (cash account week 48) the Marine Drive
branch declared a shortage discrepancy of £3,509.18.

(d) For the week ending 4 March 2005 (cash account week 49), the Marine Drive
branch transferred the shortage discrepancy from week 48 of £3,509.18 to the
suspense account. The branch then declared a further shortage of £3,512.26.

(e) For the week ending 11 March 2004, (cash account week 50) the Marine Drive
branch did not transfer the shortage discrepancy of £3,512.26 to the suspense
account, but it was instead rolled over to week 50 without being made good.

24. In or about late June/early July 2004 and 9 July 2004, Mr Castleton wrote to me again

(pages 30 to 31 and 34 to 37). However, I do not recall seeing those letters at the

time, which may be because they were sent to the Darlington Area Office rather than

Calthorpe House, London where I was working at the time.

Factors affecting my decision to dismiss Mr Castleton’s Appeal

25. The decision to dismiss Mr Castleton’s appeal was not taken lightly. A list of the factors
affecting my decision are at pages 9 and 10. I conducted extensive analysis on the
accounting documentation made available for the Appeal as well as the transactional
records at the Marine... ° branch. The Post Office’s Transaction Processing
Department only had thr
ordered by the Marine Drive branch was significantly outside the mean average value

-error notices, all of which were accounted for. The cash

that it normally ordered. The cash ordered was systematically increased on four

occasions, following which a large cash discrepancy occurred.

26. The Marine Drive branch incurred unprecedented declared losses over a 12 week
period in respect of which Mr Castleton could only offer the explanation that it was the
Horizon System that was causing the errors. If the Horizon system was erroneously
declaring losses in the branch, there would have been no actual cash shortfalls and
there would always be sufficient amounts of cash in the branch to service is
requirements. However, Mr Castleton ordered extra cash and it was only this extra
cash which enabled the branch to continue to trade and meant that it never ran out.
Mr Castleton was unable to explain why he required additional cash if there was only a

system error. His argument that there was a system error was unfounded, but was in
any event, academic. The physical need for extra cash can only be explained by the
fact that cash was lost. ; »

weekly accounts show that the Marine Drive branch needed approximately £200,000 to

ordered £305,000 in cash to cover this period in respect of which only £20,000 was
returned. It was significant that additional cash was ordered prior to a subsequent
cash discrepancy being declared. Mr Castleton was not able to explain why such sums
of cash were ordered that were in excess of what was actually required and where it

had gone.

There were and have not been since any subsequent error notices for the branch under
Mr Castleton's operation, nor any similar experiences of large shortages by a number
of locum Subpostmasters who have all operated the same pieces of Horizon kit, week

in week out.

In the circumstances, I believed (and still believe) that the decision ultimately to
dismiss Mr Castleton was soundly based and that the arguments he advanced held no
credence whatsoever and accordingly I dismissed his Appeal. I wrote to Mr Castleton
‘on 9 July 2004 to confirm my decision (page 38).

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.

WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANDREW WISE

st Office Limited (the Post
Office). I have worked for tl ‘ since “1999. I am responsible for
training sub-postmasters and bri 1 Staff on ‘Horizon and co-ordinating
national training issues. From May 2001 to lovember 2004, I was a postal officer
at the National Business ‘Support Centre (NBSC). However due to my experience
and knowledge, “Twas often asked to stand in as a team leader. My
responsibilities included those: of a. service support advisor involved in answering
calls which were generally more ‘complex then the first tier of calls that sub-

postimasters make NBSC. Prior to that, I was a Horizon field support officer from
41999 to 2001 and prior to that I spent 8 years as a counter clerk. I have a
working knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a
computerised accounting system used by the Post Office.

I make this Wi ness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless
otherwise stated. References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to

3. The Post Office provides a service to sub-postmasters and clerks called the NBSC,
which is a helpline they can call to try to resolve business related queries.

4. There are two tiers of service support at NBSC. Tier one is essentially customer
services and is a separate entity. Tier two is run by the Post Office and is for calls
that tier one are unable to deal with. I understand that an individual at tier one
could take approximately 2,000 calls each day fis it correct to say that an

8. Asummary of the prescribed daily procedures that sub-postmasters must follow is
at pages 1 to 2. This includes the following: .

TV Licenses - Non Barcode

9. Each day the sub-postmaster must enter details on the green daily summary form
P5744 which is retained at the branch. They have to print a daily report and
check that the totals of the counter foils agree with that report [was this the
system in place at the time? Does the daily report info come from

1A_1198369_1 2

POL00071231
POL00071231
Horizon?). If they do, they cut off the report on the computer to reset it to zero
for the next day. They then paperclip together none barcoded TV and non
barcoded over 75 counter foils and send the counter foils EDS Processing Centre.
[did they send them to EDS at the time? For cheques, I understand the
migration to EDS took place around Feb 2004.)

Personal Banking

10. The sub-postmaster has to print a report each day and check that the totals on
the print out agree with the documents to hand (whether cash deposit, cheque

deposit envelope or encashment cheques) if the totals agree, they then have to

cut off the report so that it resets for the next day, perclip the cash deposit

slips, check deposit envelopes and then encashed cheques fegether and place in

the envelope to go to the EDS Processing Centre: ~

at pages 3 to Firstly, they have to check outstanding transaction corrections,
which must be resolved before the end of the week's trading period. [what is a
Transaction Correction? Is a trading period from week to week or do you

mean each day?].

13. They then have to complete the counter daily and counter weekly reports [are
those the reports that are mentioned above or are they something else?
What are the daily reports? And what do they look like?]. [what are the
weekly reports and what do they look like and what information do they
contain?]. They are then are encouraged to print a balance snapshot and use
that to ensure that the Horizon system held stock figures matches the actual

1A_1198369.1 3

POL00071231
POL00071231
stock holdings in their branch. They also have to check all receipt and payment
transaction totals with the supporting vouchers/documentation. There are ways
in which they can amend any stock discrepancies. They then have to print the
mandatory office weekly reports [what are these?].

14. The sub-postmaster then completes all other manual summaries and
reconciliations, for example National Savings Weekly Summary, Change Given
Return, Electric Tokens, Promotional/Payment Vouchers, MVL Weekly
Reconciliation, Rod Licence Reconciliation, Gift Voucher Weekly Reconciliation,
DVLA Premium Service Summaries, UK PA Check and Send summaries, Electric
Schemes and National Lottery Cheque Prize Payments.

15. The sub-postmaster then prints foreign currency what i¢this? Is it a list of
what foreign currency they have?] and to’ check the figures against their

actual stock holdings. They then make n

hand stamps,

entering on the system the cash nominations they have and a number of each
different type of stamps. They then print a f rtswhich is kept with their branch.
They then print the balance report and have’ to

18. At the end of the trading period, they also complete the MVL Monthly Stock
Report (P6520) {what is that?] and the gift voucher, monthly stock report form
{again what is that?], The branch then completes the branch trading statement
which they have to sign and date stamp and retain in a suitable folder for 6 years.

[Andrew please can you check that these were the procedures in place in
December 2003 to March 2004, which is the period that we are looking at

and if they weren’t can you amend accordingly and insert what
procedures were actually in place at that time].

The Horizon System

POL00071231
POL00071231
19, Accordingly, it can be seen that if the clerk or sub-postmaster makes a mistake
when imputing transaction details into their computer, there are a number of
points at which this can be picked up, because there are daily and weekly reports
that the sub-postmaster have to produce at which stage they have to check and
satisfy themselves that the documents eg cheques, cash, giros, they have match
what they have entered on the system. In addition to that, there are various
teams responsible for different sorts of paperwork, including a giro bank team,
cheques team and pension team. For example, if the clerk records an item as a
cheque rather than cash, they should pick this up on either their daily or weekly
report. However if they fail to do so, this will be picked up at the EDS Processing

Centre. Merely because an item has been recorded as a cheque rather than cash

the branch. If an item

NBSC Review

20. Around 4 March 2 esby asked *NBSC to review what could have been

causing the errors. Sarah Pennington (who has since left the Post Office)
ind discussed it with me. She then reported to Andrew Price
reported.back to Mrs Oglesby on 20 April 2004. (page 13).
it Sarah Pennington spoke to the sub-postmaster at Marine

reviewed. this
(NBSC) who in tu!
the e-mail states tt
Drive ho wasn’t sure what was causing the errors and that he had been using

the slave computer terminal to enter his stock and cash, which he was told would
not cause lem as long as it was attached to the correct stock unit. If there
was any communication problem between the two computers, the words “node

disconnected” would flash up on screen.

21. The sub-postmaster apparently thought there were some errors relating to the
National Lottery. I understand from the e-mail that Sarah phoned the lottery
team at transaction processing who confirmed that there were some errors, but
for every charge error there was a corresponding claim error as the clerk and/or
sub-postmaster had entered the lottery figures in the wrong cash account period.
If the cash account period (week number) is wrong one week, the next week this
would balance out, hence the sub-postmaster would receive a charge error in the
first week and a claim error in the second week.

1A_1198369_1 5

POL00071231
POL00071231
22. Sarah’s e-mail records that the sub-postmaster was also concerned that when
entering the lottery figures, the terminals did not appear to be communicating.
However if that had been the case, the sub-postmaster would have a very large
number of errors on every report and product.

23. I looked at the cash account information that the sub-postmaster sent to me but
was unable to find any errors. [do you still have this or your analysis?]. The
only amount questioned was a large amount on the cheques to Processing Centre,
but I was able to confirm that this was a cheque payment for the purchase of the

premium bonds. Accordingly, there is nothing more could do and we

suggested he work a manual system at the side of Hor izon to see if any problems

were highlighted. He was also advised to take a snapsho re and after he did

the REMs to see if there were any problems occurring when he did a remittance.

24. We concluded that the Horizon system wi

find anything. The NBSC went through all the balanced cheques with him. It
appeared that the sub-postmaster had checked the REMs in and out, his cash,
stock and profit and Allowances but was unable to find the loss. The sub-
postmaster was therefore advised that this matter would be passed through to
the suspense team. (When cash or stock goes into a branch, it is “remmed” in ie
entered into or out of the system. The sub-postmaster has to check the rem foils
to verify that he receives the cash or stock listed on the foil).

3. The Post Office provides a service to sub-postmasters and clerks called the NBSC,
which is a helpline they can call to try to resolve business related queries.

4. There are two tiers of service support at NBSC. Tier one is essentially customer
services and is a separate entity. Tier two is run by the Post Office and is for calls
that tier one are unable to deal with, I understand that an individual at tier one
could take approximately 2,000 calls each day fis it correct to say that an

individual will take 2,000 calls per day or that tier one overall will take

2,000 per day] and at tier two, an individual could take approximately 30 calls

8. Asummary of the prescribed daily procedures that sub-postmasters must follow is
at pages 1 to 2. This includes the following:

TV Licenses - Non Barcode

9. Each day the sub-postmaster must enter details on the green daily summary form
P5744 which is retained at the branch. They have to print a daily report and
check that the totals of the counter foils agree with that report [was this the
system in place at the time? Does the daily report info come from

1A_1198369_1 2
Horizon?]. If they do, they cut off the report on the computer to reset it to zero
for the next day. They then paperclip together none barcoded TV and non
barcoded over 75 counter foils and send the counter foils EDS Processing Centre.
[did they send them to EDS at the time? For cheques, I understand the
migration to EDS took place around Feb 2004.)

10. The sub-postmaster has to print a report each day and check that the totals on
the print out agree with the documents to hand (whether cash deposit, cheque
deposit envelope or encashment cheques) if the totals agree, they then have to
cut off the report so that it resets for the next day,
slips, check deposit envelopes and then encashed
the envelope to go to the EDS Processing Centre:

13, They then have to complete the counter daily and counter weekly reports fare

stock holdings in their branch. They also have to check all receipt and payment
transaction totals with the supporting vouchers/documentation. There are ways
in which they can amend any stock discrepancies. They then have to print the
mandatory office weekly reports [what are these?].

14. The sub-postmaster then completes all other manual summaries and
reconciliations, for example National Savings Weekly Summary, Change Given
Return, Electric Tokens, Promotional/Payment Vouchers, MVL Weekly
Reconciliation, Rod Licence Reconciliation, Gift Voucher Weekly Reconciliation,
DVLA Premium Service Summaries, UK PA Check and Send summaries, Electric

19, Accordingly, it can be seen that if the clerk or sub-postmaster makes a mistake
when imputing transaction details into their computer, there are a number of
points at which this can be picked up, because there are daily and weekly reports
that the sub-postmaster have to produce at which stage they have to check and
satisfy themselves that the documents eg cheques, cash, giros, they have match
what they have entered on the system.

“In addition to that, there are various teams responsible for different sorts of
paperwork, including a giro bank team, cheques team and pension team. For
example, if the clerk records an item as a cheque rather than cash, they should

pick this up on either their daily or weekly report. However if they fail to do so,

this will be picked up at the EDS Processing Centre. ly because an item has

been recorded as a cheque rather than cash (or visa 3a)swould not of course

Drive who sure what was causing the errors and that he had been using
the slave computer terminal to enter his stock and cash, which he was told would
not cause a problem as long as it was attached to the correct stock unit. If there
was any communication problem between the two computers, the words “node

disconnected” would flash up on screen.

21, The sub-postmaster apparently thought there were some errors relating to the
National Lottery. I understand from the e-mail that Sarah phoned the lottery
team at transaction processing who confirmed that there were some errors, but
for every charge error there was a corresponding claim error as the clerk and/or
sub-postmaster had entered the lottery figures in the wrong cash account period.
If the cash account period (week number) is wrong one week, the next week this

14_1198369_1 5

would balance out, hence the sub-postmaster would receive a charge error in the
first week and a claim error in the second week.

entering the lottery figures, the terminals did not appear to be communicating.

stock and profit and Allowances but was unable to find the loss. The sub-

postmaster was therefore advised that this matter would be passed through to
the suspense team, (When cash or stock goes into a branch, it is “remmed” in ie
entered into or out of the system. The sub-postmaster has to check the rem foils
to verify that he receives the cash or stock listed on the foil).

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF CATHERINE OGLESBY

1, CATHERINE OGLESBY of
IAN WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

1. Since April 2005, I have been a Sales Account Manager for the Post Office Limited
(the Post Office) with responsibility for ensuring that 24 directly managed post
office branches achieve their sales targets. Before that, I was a Retail Line
Manager (RLM) for approximately 8 years. As an RLM, I was responsible for
ensuring that sub postmasters in 85 sub post offices properly carried out their
duties to maintain service standards (for example, in relation to waiting times and
office appearance) and reach sales targets. I have worked for the Post office for
23 years.

2. I make this witness statement from facts within my own knowledge unless
otherwise stated. I have had the benefit of reading through my correspondence
and papers. References to page numbers in this witness statement are to page
numbers of Exhibit CO2 to this witness statement.

3. Ihave been asked to give a brief overview of the layout of!
(the Marine Drive branch) and describe how the business
works, for the benefit of the Court. At pages 1 to 3 are office copy entries which

show that Mr Lee Castleton and Mrs Lisa Marie Castleton have been the registered

proprietors of the freehold since 17 October 2003 and that they bought the
freehold on 18 July 2003. At page 4 is a rough plan I have drawn from memory
of the interior of the Marine Drive branch [Cath, please can you draw and send
to me a reugh plan of the ground floor?]. The ground floor of the freehold
contains a rectangular shaped shop and from the entranceway, the Post Office
counter is in the far left hand corner of the shop. The shop counter and National
Lottery till are on the right as you enter the shop. [Are there living quarters
upstairs for Castleton]?

From 18 Juiy 2003 to 23 March 2004 Mr Castleton was subpostmaster of the
Marine Drive branch. His contract for services was in the standard format used for
subpostmasters at the time and a copy of that contract together with the signed

page is at pages [ ] (the Contact). n
é

a
5. Section 1, paragraph 3 of the Contract prevides that the subpostmaster must
provide and maintain at his own expense, reasonable office accommodation
required by the Post Officer and pay, also at his own expense, any assistants he
may need to carry on post Office business, At the material time, Mr Castleton
retained Christine Train as his assistant Wo work behind the Post Office counter
and I believe that she had worked at the Marine Drive branch for many years.
[Do you remember whether anyone else worked behind the P.O counter

6. There are 2 Post Office counter positions at the Marine Drive branch, pach with its
own computer terminal, barcode scanner and printer. Before open of business
each day, the subpostmaster and any assistant logs on to their computeri They
must record all transactions they perform on their computer. They can record
transactions either by using their touch sensitive screen or keyboard. The
computer system in the branches is called Horizon. Horizon is in effect, a

sophisticated computerised calculator.

So per & ( acall oe pou ghee be lrangachies

7. every transaction {recorded by the subpostmaster and his assistant on to
their computer has one or sometimes more corresponding physical documents.

For example, when a customer pays their TV license, the subpostmaster will
retain the TV licence counter foil. If that customer paid for their licence by

cheque, the subpostmaster will also have the cheque.

8, [Do you feel comfortable saying this para?] At the end of each day, the
subpostmaster prints from their computer various reports. The procedure is
slightly different for different products, but broadly speaking, they then compare
these reports against the physical documents they have (such as cheques or
licence counterfoils) to ensure they match. They then send the reports and
accompanying documents off to be processed. When these are processed, if the
covering report printed out from the branch’s computer does not match the
accompanying physical documents, an error notice is generated. An error notice
is a correction statement. Its creation would help explain whether there was any
legitimate reason for an error having been made (for example, because
subpostmaster or his assistant made an incorrect entry into the computer when
recording a transaction).

9. At the material time, the subpostmaster also had to balance ‘on a weekly basis
and produce a cash account. The cash account contained information such as
cash and stock in hand at the end of that week, receipts, payments, the balance
due to the Post Office and whether there were any discrepancies such as a surplus /
or shortfall. The subpostmasters had to sign the cash account to certify that it \
accurate.

December 2003 S
10. Between approximately Christmas 2003 and the New Year, I was contacted by
telephone by Mr Castieton who told me that on week 39 (the week ending 23
December 2003), he had been £1,100 short in his cash account. We discussed
what might be the-usyal explanation for this, for example the Giro Bank error or
cheque deposits going through as cash. I suggested that he contact Giro Bank and
National Savings to see if there were any problems. I also asked him to make

good the sum of £1,100, because a Giro Bank error notice may take up to 8 weeks ,
to arrive. Mr Castleton said that he could make the amount good and we Jeft
things at that.

11. This had been the first time since Mr Castleton took over the Post Office in July
2003 that he had any major problems in balancing: “Copies of the Cash Accounts
signed by Mr Castleton for the weeks ending 23 December 2003 (cash account
week 39), 30 December 2003 (cash account week 40), 7 January 2004 (cash

Shortfalls in January 2004

12. In accordance with my normal visiting plan, I visited the Marine Drive Branch on

Friday 16 January 2004. At the time, no reason had come to light to explain the
loss of £1,100. The previous 3 weeks’ balances seemed to be fine. kes Ce

(cash-account week 43) Mr Castiton c contacted me

Savings to séé whether there were any problems. I also asked him whether the
cash was kept secure and who had access to it. Mr Castleton did not believe that
any of his staff could have taken the money. He stated that on this occasion, he
was unable to make good the shortfall. I advised him to contact the helpline to
get a hardship form. (A sub postmaster is contractually obliged to make good any
shortfalls without delay. However if a sub postmaster cannot immediately make
goods the shortfalls, he may complete and submit a hardship form setting out
details of his earnings and other relevant information to seek the Post Office’s
permission to make good the shortfalls by instalment payments rather than

immediately).

14. We also discussed at length ways for him to double check all of the paperwork

leaving the Marine Drive Branch (for example, the giro paying in slips, pension and
allowance dockets and certain types of cheques) and to perform a snapshot each
evening to check the cash. (Effectively, the balance snapshot is just a facility to
allow the sub postmaster to quickly check transactions through the week. It is a
report that contains what the computer believes should be the total cash in stock
figure, not what cash the branch actually does have. It looks at the previous
week’s declared cash in stock and adjusts items as they are sold, so if someone
forgets to enter an item that a customer has purchased, then the balance snapshot

figure will be inaccurate).

15.1 contacted Mr Castleton by telephone on or around 28 January 2004 (cash
account week 44). After he said he was a further £2,500 short, again, we had a
lengthy discussion to discuss all the daily workings. A copy of the Cash Account
for that week signed by Mr Castleton is at pages 102 to 111. I brought up in the

yg Ferzen

POL00071231

conversation the possibility that somebody might be taking the cash, but Mr
Castleton discounted that possibility. I suggested that he carry out individual
stock unit balancing. Small post offices such as the Marine Drive Branch which has
2 cashier positions run a shared stock system: All the cash and stock is contained
on 1 balance sheet. However, with individual stock balancing, each computer has
its own separate stock and cash balance. Mr Castleton did not wish to do this, as
he felt that Marine Drive Branch did not lend itself to doing this sort of balancing.
I was surprised that Mr Castleton did not take up my suggestion because although
there is some work involved setting up individual stock balancing, it would have
enabled us to identify whether the losses were caused by any individual cashier.

Shortfalls in February 2004

16. The next week ended 5 February 2005, (cash account week 45) the Marine Drive Wa P:
Branch was only £25 short (pages 112 to 123) [Cath can you check this od cs
because looking at the cash account, I think it was £25 over this week, Rae ae ; a
not short], However, the week after ending 11 February 2004 (cash account e Nae
week 46) the Marine Drive Branch was £1,500 short (pages 124 to 135). By now, co.
after just 4 weeks, the Marine Drive Branch was a total of £8,243.10 short, not i aN

counting the sum of £1,100 that Mr Castleton had made good to start-with: IT

visited the Marine Drive branch around this time and asked Mr Castleton whether
_he had obtained a Hardship Form. Hi said that he hadn't and I advised him to,
obtain one. I understand that he did, and he placed sum of £8,243.10 into the ~S Re
suspense account. Sub postmasters are 2 contractiially obliged to make good all w wy
losses without delay and Mr Castleton should not have been rolling them over each

week. The purpose of having a suspense account was simply so that a shortfall
that a subpostmaster does not immediately made good could be temporarily
moved to the suspense account rather than being left in the cash account. By this

time, I was very concerned and contacted the investigations team and asked them

to carry out an audit.

17. In cash account week 48 (the week ending 25 February 2004) the short fall for
that week alone was £3,509.18 (pages 148 to 159). Mr Castleton informed me
that he and his assistant Mrs Christine Train spent many hours double checking
the transaction logs to try to prove that it was the computer equipment that was
changing the figures. I asked him if he had found anything, but he had not.
However, he was convinced that since he had a processor changed about the time
the losses started occurring that it was the processor that was causing the losses.

I asked Mr Castleton to contact Fujitsu services (who were responsible for
designing, implementing and operating the Harlzqn system) to obtain a system
check. He did this and the system check came bagk fine. I asked Mr Castleton to
contact the Horizon system helpline (HSH) which he did and I understand that he
sent cash accounts to the National Business Supgert Centre (NBSC) to review. I
also asked Mr Castleton to contact the Post Officd’s Transaction Processing section

to see whether there were any error notices pending.

Shortfalls in March 2004

20.In the week ending 3 March 2004 (cash account week 49), Mr Castleton
transferred the previous weeks balance to the suspense account. The suspense
account then totalled £11,752.78. In addition, the Marine Drive Branch Cash
Account showed a further shortage of £3,512.26 (pages 160 to 171). Mr Castleton
did not make good this amount.

21. In the week ending 10 March 2004 (cash account week 50) the previous week’s
shortage of £3,512.26 was rolled over and the shortage in the cash account
increased to £10,653.11 (pages 172 to 183).

23. On 23 March 2004, Helen Rose (nee Hollingworth) of the Pos¥/Office carried out an
audit of the Marine Drive Branch together with Chris Taylor! The audit concluded
that there was a total unauthorised shortfall of £25,758.75 (page 1).

24. I arrived at the Marine Drive Branch in the afternoon of 23 March 2004 and took
Mr Castleton into the back room to speak to him. I told him that as a
precautionary measure, and with his permission, I would like to remove him and
his staff from the Marine Drive Branch and to operate the branch with a temporary
post master to see how it would balance. I wanted the temporary subpostmaster
to retain the same Horizon system that Mr Castleton and his team had been
working with to try and keep everything the same. Mr Castleton and his assistant
Mrs Train were both angry. Mr Castleton said that he could not wait until the
temporary sub postmaster was “thousands short next week” and that “heads will
roll” for the distress that he had suffered.

25. On the same day, Lesley Joyce (the Post Office’s contract manager) wrote to Mr

Castleton to confirm that he was suspended as a precautionary measure pending
further investigations (page 3).

Events following Mr Castleton‘s suspension

26. I asked a very experienced post master, Mrs Ruth Simpson, from the First Lane

27.

28.

29.

Post Office in Hull if she would run the Marine Drive Branch on a temporary basis.
Mrs Simpson agreed, but was only able to run the Marine Drive Branch for a few
weeks as she had other commitments. She opened the Marine Drive Branch on
the morning of Wednesday 24 March 2004 and balanced £2.14 short on that night.
She brought with her a part time assistant to help out on Mondays. On the close
of business on the WRN se ancl ending 31 March 2004), she was £100
short and explained that this is because her assistant had left something in the
stack and erroneously paid this amount twice. (The stack is an on screen list of
transactions for the individual customer that is being served at the time. Each
time a new customer is served, the stack should be cleared so that it starts from
zero). A copy of the Cash Account for that week is at pages 196 to 201.

I telephoned Mr Castleton to see what his reaction would be. He stated that Mrs
Simpson was only using 1 computer rather than 2 as he had done, so it was not a
true reflection of how he ran the Marine Drive Branch. He also stated that Mrs
Simpson had misbalanced (i.e there was a shortfall of £100). I said that I would
speak with Mrs Simpson regarding his concerns. I contacted her and asked her to
use both machines. She stated that on a Monday she had 2 people working all
day, so 2 machines were used. The rest of the week she was on her own, but
logged on to the system with 2 usernames and had 2 machines running, she was
serving customers from both machines, remming in on both and putting the lottery
cash on both.

On the week ending 7 April 2004 (cash account week 02), Mrs Simpson was
£19.38 over (pages 202 to 207). We discussed how she was getting on every
other day and she would text me to confirm that she was okay. On her next
balance for the week ending 14 April 2004 (cash account week 03) she was £10.76
short (pages 208 to 213).

On 16 April 2004, I visited the Marine Drive Branch and spoke to Mr Castieton ©
away from the counter. He was distressed. We discussed Mrs Simpson’s balancing
results. Mrs Train wanted to know where the £100 shortage had gone in Mrs
Simpson’s first full week and I explained what she had thought. Mrs Train became
aggressive and threatening. I said that I felt the balance reflected any normal

1A_1107486_3 8

Le
Sub-Post Office. Mr Castleton again stated that it was the computer that was
making the losses. I told Mr Castleton that Mrs Simpson would be finishing on
Wednesday 21 April 2004 due to other commitments and said that I wanted more
time and more balance results and wanted another temporary subpostmaster to
take over, Mr Castleton said that he did not wish to go back on the counter as
things stood anyway.

30. On the week ending Wednesday 21 April 2004, (cash account week 04) there was
a surplus for the week of £0.02 (pages 214 to 219). Mr Greg Booth took over as
temporary Sub-Postmaster on the same day. He completed his first week on
Wednesday 28 April 2004 and declared a gain of £14.76 (pages 220 to 225),

31. On 23 April, Mr Franks (Mr Castleton’s father-in-law) contacted me by telephone
to discuss the way in which Mr and Mrs Castleton had been treated. I explained
the situation and told him that the suspension was a precaution and that I was
hoping that by having a temporary Sub-Postmaster in the office, that if there were
any problems with the computer equipment, this would come to light. Mr Franks
demanded that Mr Castleton be reinstated immediately. I referred him to the Post
Office Head of Area, David Mellows-Facer and told him that I could not agree to
reinstate Mr Castleton at the time. 1 understand that Mr Franks spoke with David
Mellows-Facer and asked for a speedy conclusion to the situation, David Mellows-
Facer spoke to me and asked me whether Mr Castleton could be interviewed as

soon as possible.

32. On 26 April 2004, I wrote to Mr Castleton and stated that there was a shortage of
£25,758.75 and that he had reported large, unexplained losses over the preceding
12 weeks. I asked him to explain the reasons why his contract should not be
terminated summarily (pages 4 and 5).

33. On 28 April 2004, Mr Castleton replied and queried whether the losses existed or
whether they were “a figment of a computer's imagination”. He asked me to send
to him various documents and information (pages 6 and 9).

34. I contacted the Transactions Processing Department again on 29 April 2004 to see
whether there were any outstanding error notices. There was an error for the
National Lottery that had yet to be investigated for £125. There had also been an
error for cheques that later cleared and did not generate an error notice. There
was also an error for an Easy Access Account that had been processed incorrectly.

4A_1107486_3 9

POL00071231
POL00071231

I contacted Girobank to see whether there were any errors outstanding with them.
T asked them to look back to week 43, They looked back as far as week 43 and
came forward to week 02. There was a small error of £1.43, but that would not be
reported. Everything else was fine.
tp 8y ones es te
35. Mr Castleton telephoned me on 4 May 2004 and stated that he had found £15,000
of the losses. I asked him where he had found the cash. He stated that the
suspense account had doubled the figures. When he had put the cash into the
suspense account, although the amount was showing in the suspense account, it
was also stili showing as a loss in the cash account again the next week. Mr
Castleton asked for the suspense account software to be checked. I again
contacted the NBSC to request this.

36. To test whether the suspense account was having any effect on the balance, I
contacted the temporary Sub-Postmaster, Greg Booth on or around 5 May 2004. I
asked him how he was balancing that week on his snapshots. He told me that he
had a few pounds over. I told Mr Booth what Mr Castleton had said about the
suspense account. I asked Mr Booth to put £100 into the shortages line on the
suspense account. First he ran an office snapshot (pages 232 to 233), then he
placed the £100 into the account, then he ran a second snapshot (pages 234 and
235) and a suspense account report (236 and 237). During this time, the same
Horizon kit was still being used by the assistant. The £100 was in the correct place
and the cash figure on the snapshot had changed by £100. This demonstrated that
the system worked correctly. I asked Mr Booth to balance with those amounts still
in the account. He should balance £100 over. I would then call into the Marine
Drive branch on 7 May 2004 and we would take the amount out, to see if the
opposite occurred. Mr Booth left me a message on my telephone later that
evening to state that he had balanced over, just as we had expected.

37. For the week ending 5 May 2004 (cash account week 06), the Marine Drive branch

declared a small gain of £103.11 (pages 226 to 231).

38. On 6 May 2004, I wrote to Mr Castletor! and sent to him a copy of an email from
Fujitsu and logs of calls to the NBSC and HSH (pages 10 to 20). I also sent to him
a copy of the Horizon System User Guide, System Failure Sub-Sections 12 and 13
and a copy of the Audit Report (pages 21 to 37). The email from Andrew Price at
the NBSC dated 20 April 2004 to me stated:

1A_1107486_3 10

POL00071231
POL00071231
“The PM sent cash account information to NBSC and it was looked at by
Andrew Wise, he was unable to find any errors. The only amount questioned
was a large amount on the cheques to processing centre which Andrew was
able to confirm was a cheque for the purchase of Premium Bonds. The PM
was advised there was nothing more we could do and we suggested that he
works on a manual system at the side of Horizon to see if any problems
were highlighted. Also, when doing the REMS the PM should take a snapshot
before and after to see if any problems were occurring when doing a
remittance. Andrew Wise and I both feel that the Horizon system is working
properly and we are unable to help the PM any further.”

39. The email from Julie Welsh, Service Delivery Manager HSH Fujitsu Services stated:

“There is no evidence whatsoever of any system problem... please tell the PM
that we have investigated and the discrepancies are caused by the
difference between the transactions they have recorded on the system and
the cash they have declared, and are not being caused by the software or
hardware.” (page 42).

40. On 6 May 2004, I also contacted the Transaction Processing Department at
Chesterfield again to check whether there were any outstanding errors. Only the
easy access error was still showing. 1 also contacted Mr Castleton by telephone
and informed him that I had received his letter and was doing all I could to get
him the information he had requested. I said that I would probably not be able to
obtain everything that he had asked for.

41. On 7 May 2004, I visited Greg Booth at the Marine drive branch, as arranged.
First he ran an office snapshot (pages 238 to 239), then he removed the £100
from the suspense account and ran a second snapshot (pages 240 to 241) and a
suspense account report (242 to 243). Again, the cash figure in the snapshot and
the suspense account had changed by £100 which demonstrated that the system
worked correctly.

Interview with Mr Castleton on 10 May 2004
42. On 10 May 2004, I interviewed Mr Castleton. Ms Lesley Joyce (Contract Manager)

and Mrs Train were also present. A copy of the Minutes of the interview meeting
are at pages 43 to 45. At the interview, I explained that it was his opportunity to

POL00071231
POL00071231

43.

46.

give any explanation as to why his contract for services should not be terminated.
I summarised the events which lead to his suspension on 23 March 2004 due to an
unexplained shortage at that time of £25,758.75. During the 12 weeks prior to
this audit, the Marine Drive Branch had several large unexplained losses, The
figure for cash on the system was not the same as the physical amount of cash at
the Marine Drive Branch. Mr Castleton stated that the Horizon system was to
blame.

I informed Mr Castleton that since he had been suspended, the same Horizon
system had remained in place and that there had not been any further complaints
about it from the Marine Drive Branch and that the cash account showed no large
losses. The Horizon system did crash whilst Mrs Simpson was running the branch,
but when she rebooted it, this did not effect the balance. When Mrs Simpson had
finished, Mr Booth was appointed as a temporary sub postmaster, and again, he

had no problems.

. Mr Castleton stated that he had not taken any money and that he trusted his staff

not to have taken anything. Mr Castleton said that he had asked for 10 pieces of
information and I explained that I had only received his letter 2 working days prior
to the interview and that I was working on obtaining this.

I checked that Mr Castleton understood how the cash account worked with regards
to balances and losses and gains and he confirmed he understood it. I then went
into detail with balances, error notices, losses etc and the evidence I had with the
snapshots and declared cash. I provided all of this information to Mr Castleton,
together with a list of the results of the balance.

At the end of each day the subpostmaster is supposed to count their cash [fs that
right?], type the details into their computer stating the quantity of each
denomination they have and then print a cash declaration [is this exactly the
same thing as the ONCH report?) to declare the quantity of cash in the tills
overnight. I referred Mr Castleton to some of the cash declarations which had
been manually altered or written on. Specifically I referred him to week 47 and
also the declaration on 12 February 2004 which had a figure of approximately
£7,000 written onto the bottom of the cash declaration. Mr Castleton thought it
was Mrs Train’s writing, but she was not sure. I said this was very important
because although the cash account for week 46 showed a loss of £8,243.10/jthe
following snapshots and declared cash did not match. For example:

gain of £6,809.51.

(c) The balance snapshot of Monday 16 February 2004 showed that the Marine

the cash declaration showed that it had £84,909.54 (page ), an apparent gain

(d) The balance snapshot dated Tuesday 17 February 2004 showed that the
Marine Drive Branch needed £68,163.08 to achieve a perfect balance (page ),
but the cash declaration showed that he actually had £74,939.85 (page ), an
apparent gain of £6,776.77.

In other words, according to the cash declarations, the Marine Drive branch had

more cash than it required to balance.

Crucially, the cash account on Wednesday 18 February 2004 showed that the
cash is an exact match for the cash required on the balance. I asked Mr Castleton
where the surplus had gone. He had no explanation and stated that it was
something to do with Horizon. I gave Mr Castleton other examples where there
were shortages in subsequent weeks and that they did not match the snapshot in
the cash declaration.

I explained to Mr Castleton that the Horizon system is a double entry accounting
system and that everything I had checked worked through. The evidence does not
support Mr Castleton’s theory that the Horizon system went wrong when he
entered the stock remittances on to the system.

After the interview, I sent copies of the cash and suspense accounts to Elizabeth
Morgan and Davlyn Cumberland in Leeds who were two people very experienced
in dealing with the suspense accounts. Neither of them could see anything wrong
with the way that the computers were working.

On 14 May 2004, I wrote to Mr Castleton to clarify the entries at the top of the
final balance that he had queried and to explain why the 2 final balances he had
mentioned did not look similar (page 46). I also sent him a copy of the interview
notes.

Mr Castleton’s dismissal

53.

54,

Mr Castleton did not provide any evidence of a computer problem. All the entries
in his cash accounts were double checked. The figure declared for cash on the
system did not match the physical amount of cash he had in his office. This
showed that there was an actual loss, rather than a computer problem.

Mr Castleton denied taking the cash, but he would not take my advice to try
individual balancing, or listen to my suggestion that a member of his staff might
be taking the money.

The Transaction Processing Department at Chesterfield and Girobank have stated
that they had no outstanding error notices to issue. Fujitsu Services had checked

On 23 May 2004, Mr Castleton wrote to me to confirm that he wished to appeal
against my decision (page 49). He also stated that he was seeking further
information relating to the computer fault. On 1 June 2004 he wrote directly to

WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANNE CHAMBERS

I, ANNE CHAMBERS of |
8SN WILL SAY AS FOLLOW:

1. I am a System Specialist employed by Fujitsu.s, I have worked for Fujitsu
(previously ICL) since 1978. I have a working knowledge of the computer system
known as Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office
Limited (Post Office). I am responsible for investigation of problems which are,
or are suspected to be, caused by software or hardware errors anywhere in the
Horizon system. I am authorised by Fujitsu Services to view extractions of audit
data held on the ‘Horizon system and to obtain system transaction information

from the live Horizon system.

2. 4d make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless
otherwise stated. References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to
page numbers of Exhibit “AC1” to this Witness Statement.

3. Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to
the business of Fujitsu Services. These were compiled during the ordinary course
of business from information supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be
supposed to have personal knowledge of the matter dealt with in the information

4. Calls from Post Masters relating to potential system problems are initially taken
and logged by the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). Business issues, which
include problems with discrepancies when balancing the branch accounts, are
expected to be handled in the first instance by the National Business Support
Centre (NBSC), run by the Post Office. If these helpdesks are unable to resolve
the problem, calls may be passed to the System Support Centre (SSC), the unit in
which I work, I have access to much more detailed system information than do
the other units. Ly

to the central data centre and compared with the total transactions received at
the data centre from the branch, to ensure that all transactions recorded at the

branch have reached the data centre. If the gateway terminal is not in
communication with the second terminal, the totals are not calculated until
communications are restored.

8, Further checks are made when the sub-postmaster has produced the weekly cash
account at the end of the financial week - normally Wednesday. The cash
account lines are produced by processing the entire week’s transactions as
recorded at the branch, the paper copies of the cash account are printed, and the
electronic copy is sent to the data centre. Each day, the gateway terminal has
added up the day’s transactions according to where they. should appear in the
cash account, and summarises them at the end of the week. The data centre also

produces a weekly cash account based on all the transactions received from the
branch during the week. There are therefore effectivel

accounts:

a) The official branch weekly cash accourit;
b) The branch daily account, summarised at the end of the week; and
c) The data centre weekly cash account.

Any differences between any of these will res It in One or more reconciliation

report entries. Report entries are only produced if there are differences.

9. I found no reconciliation report entries relating to this branch, indicating that all
transactions recorded-at' the branch had reached the data centre and had been
included in the official branch cash account. My checks covered at least two
weeks prior to the investigation, i.e. weeks 47 and 48.

10. 1 examined the branch messagestore as at 26" February 2004. This contained,
among othe things, all the transactions completed in the previous 34 days, and
any cash, stamp and stock declarations or adjustments made at the branch. I

looked primarily at one of the latest financial weeks - I cannot remember now
whether I checked week 47 or 48.

11. Cheques were handled correctly as far as the system was concerned. I checked
the remittance out of the cheques, which is normally done several times a week,
as the sub-postmaster had reported a problem with this on 10" February (call
reference e-0402130267) (page ). I found that on that one day, the cheque
listing report was not cut off after the day’s cheques had been remmed out. ‘Cut
off’ involves pressing a button on the system to confirm that you have completed
processing of the report, so that when the report is next printed, it will include

1A_1208412_1 3
POL00071231
POL00071231

only transactions done after the cut-off point. Since the report was not cut off,
when next printed, it still included the cheques that had already been despatched.
I confirmed that the total value of cheques remmed out of the system equalled
the values of cheques received, and so the failure in process did not cause any
financial discrepancy.

wos

12. Following up a furtifer point from call reference e-0402130267, I noticed that
occasionally, fen they declared the cash held in the office at the end of the
working day; they did not always use the same declaration identification number.

mas
Se SoM

co For example if a sub-postmaster uses number 01 and enters £10,000 and then

changes their number and uses 11 to record it elsewhere, the system will think
that, at that point, the branch has £20,000 wheréas it-only has £10,000. 1
checked to make sure this had not been done when they declared the cash at the
end of the financial week, and it had not. -

13. I went through the cash elements of transactions Say by day and compared them
with the overnight cash declarations (ignoring any duplicated declarations as
described in paragraph 12 above). f expected to find that the cash holding
declared by the sub-postmaster at the end of a day was reasonably close to what
he had declared the previous day, adjusted by the value of the cash transactions
recorded on the system luring the day. For example, if at the end of day 1 he

was holding £50,000 cash, and during day 2 recorded transactions showing be
£6,000 cash receiver and £5,000 cash paid out, the net cash for the day would be dese fe
£1,000 received, and so ‘the cash holding at the end of day 2 should be £51,000. we

The main reason for making this check was te see if I could narrow down th f te
source of the discrepancy toa particular day. “T <, hsp leetceck 3 bay Pewhic tor”

what they had recorded on the system, This meant that it was possible that the downs)
sub-postmaster was not accurately recording all transactions on the system at the
time the cash was physically being put into or taken out of the till. This is not
necessarily a problem, as long as everything is entered and declared correctly by
the end of the financial week, but does suggest that they are not working
accurately, and it meant I could not link the weekly loss to any particular day.

15. There was no evidence whatsoever of any system problem, but the continuing
losses and calls suggested they needed some business assistance. I therefore
contacted a colleague, Julie Welsh, in Fujitsu Customer Services, and asked her to

1A_1208412_4 4

inform Post Office (page ). I updated the call with a summary of my investigation
and returned it to HSH, requesting they contact the sub-postmaster and explain
that we had investigated and the discrepancies were caused by the difference

between the transactions they had recorded on the system and the cash they
declared, and were not being caused by the software or hardware. | «25 une

3. An important element of the support provided to subpostmasters and Counter
Clerks is the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). The HSH is the Horizon user’s
first ‘port of call’ in the event of their experiencing a problem with the Horizon
system or requiring advice and guidance. If the system were to malfunction,
upon discovery the Horizon users (i.e. the sub-postmaster or counter clerk)
would raise a call to the HSH seeking clarification or advice. HSH is a service
run by Fujitsu for the Post Office. I have been asked to provide details and
information on the calls for advice and guidance logged by HSH recorded
during the period 1 December 2003 to 23 April 2004 for the 14 Marine Drive

4. I have reviewed the HSH cails pertaining to the Marine Drive branch and
during the period 1 December 2003 to 23 Api 004 there were 23 calls from
the Marine Drive branch to HSH (5 of which occurred after 23.March 2004

when I am informed that Mr Castleton was suspended). I am of the opinion

that none of these calls relate to faults which.would have had an effect on the

taken by Dane Meah at HSH from the caller who stated that there were
discrepancies going through the system for three weeks in a row. The caller was
advised that the problem would need to be thoroughly investigated by the
National Business Support Centre (NBSC) before the issue could be investigated

call closed.

8. 29 January 2004, 10.26am, call reference e-04012903568 - a call was
taken by Mary Rainbow at HSH. The sub-postmaster reported that he was having
problems on his system connected to remittances (REMs). The Sub-postmaster
has to enter a remittance when he receives a delivery of new stock. He stated
that every time he entered in the new stock, it left him with a discrepancy. The
Sub Post master was transferred to the NBSC, since this was a business issue and

the call was closed.

taken by Tony Law at HSH, referred from Marie at NBSC. The sub-postmaster
had stated that his system was doubling up cash declarations and cutting off
cheques, yet they still apparently appeared the next day. NBSC advised that they
had checked that he was cutting everything off properly and that the catch figures
were being done correctly. The sub-postmaster had insisted on a system check
being carried out. He said that the problem had been happening for five weeks
and that every time stock had been remmed in, they had a loss that night. The
sun-postmaster also stated that the cheques he had recorded on the 10" were
showing on the 11" February as well.

The call was escalated to Heather Dryden at HSH. As a sub-postmaster is
supposed to send cheques to the EDS Processing Centre each evening, the next
day you would expect to see the cheque figures cleared to zero on the Horizon
system. The sub-postmaster, initially stated that this had happened more than
once, but when Heather went through his cheques, it had happened just the once.
It appears that the sub-postmaster forgot to cut off and the cheque listing had
two days worth of cheques in it. There is no option to cut off retrospectively ie if
the sub-postmaster reveals that he has not cut off the previous days cheques,
they will show up the next day and a failure to cut off previously cannot be

corrected later. However, the point is that the system will not put the cheques in

the balance and process them twice. It will reconcile each cheque against the

transaction.

16 February 2004, 8.32am, call reference e-0402160081 - David Lawrence
at HSH took a call from Marie at NBSC. The sub: postmaster had called NBSC to
state that both his terminals were at Post Off Log On (POLO), but were

a call from Pat at NBSC. sub-postmaster had stated that he needed an OBCS

by Mary:Rainbow. The clerk reported that they had been having problems on the
system witl b Jancing that week, which seemed to be related to stock being
remmed in tl rough the week. The clerk reported that over the past 7 weeks,
they have had losses every week and at one point they had a problem with cash
on hand, but they found that this was an issue with ID numbers that had been
resolved. The clerk also reported that last week when they rolled over they put a
loss into the suspense account and then took the computer terminal back to the
trial balance which came out with a zero net discrepancy to start the new week
with. The clerk reported that she had printed out a balance snapshot on Monday
and that looked OK, but since then they had remmed in some stock which

appears to have given them a loss.

POL00071231

16. The clerk was advised that she would need to check her stock position for last
week and then check her rems in summary. This would show the stock that she
should be holding and that figure could be compared with the stock showing in
the adjust stock [what does this mean?] and this would highlight any problems
with the stock on hand. The clerk was advised that we would need her to take
her computer terminal to trial balance this evening and come back to us before
she rolls over so that we can take down any details she can give us. The clerk
confirmed that they are working on a shared stock unit and would cali back if
further assistance was required. The balance sheet would show the old
discrepancy until they can do a trial balance. The call was then closed.

post master calling the help desk, but by the System Management Centre (SMC)
“which automatically triggers a call when there is an unusual event. The call was
referred to the Sys Support Centre (SSC), so the SMC closed their call. The
term criti¢al is the. comparative level of attention required to generate remedial
action. It refers to the level of attention required on a grading system for example
critical high level of attention or warning would be medium level of attention.

20. 25 February 2004, 5.33pm, call reference e-0402251077 - Call was taken
by Kuljinder Bhachu at HSH. The sub-postmaster reported that the branch was
getting large discrepancies for the past few weeks. The closed calls were
reviewed and it was noted that a number of calls had been logged regarding
discrepancies and that the NBSC had been in contact with the sub-postmaster
could not find any user error. Kuljinder spoke to Sandra at NBSC. They checked
the Tivoli events and the system appeared to be OK. Given that a critical event
had been noted earlier that day, the event logs were downloaded for review. The

sub-postmaster advised that the problem had started ever since the BT engineer
came to move the BT box for preparation for the installation of the ADSL.
Kuljinder recommended that SSC investigate why the sub-postmaster is
experiencing large discrepancies. A known error log (KEL) reference was given
and the problem was re-assigned within HSH to group EDSC1 [what does this
stand for?}. At this point Anne Chambers of SSC investigated the matter. I note
from the log that she found that there was no evidence whatsoever of any system

problem.

Conclusion

30. I should add that this area is not my particular area of expertise. I have a general
knowledge of these procedures and have made the comments above to aid the
court. Do you feel able to say this: On the basis of my overview of the call logs
there does not appear to be any reasonable grounds for believing that the
information stored on the Horizon system would be inaccurate because of

improper use of the computer terminal.

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.

|GROWILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:
1. I am a System Specialist em,
(previously ICL) since 1978. €
known as Horizon, which is a computeris:
Limited (Post Office). I am responsible‘!

3. Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to
the business of Fujitsu Services. These were compiled during the ordinary course
of business from information supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be

supposed to have personal knowledge of the matter dealt with in the information

supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the information or cannot be
traced. As part of my duties, I have access to these records.

System Support Centre

4. Calls from Post Masters relating to potential system problems are initially taken
and logged by the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). Business issues, which
include problems with discrepancies when balancing the branch accounts, are
expected to be handled in the first instance by the National Business Support
Centre (NBSC), run by the Post Office. If these helpdesks are unable to resolve
the problem, calls may be passed to the System Support Centre (SSC), the unit in
which I work. I have access to much more detailed system information than do

the other units.

5. My initial involvement with the investigatio:

dreds of branches had had the same event at the same
idy been investigated by another member of the SSC

Continuing discrepancies (several calls)

7. I checked for any central reconciliation report entries for the branch which might
indicate a system problem. Various built in checks occur at the end of each day.
For example, the gateway terminal (i.e the particular computer at the branch
through which data is uploaded to the central data centre) will total all the
transactions completed on both terminals during the day. The total is transmitted
to the central data centre and compared with the total transactions received at

Further checks are made when the sub-postmaster has produced the weekly cash
account at the end of the financial week - normally Wednesday. The cash
account lines are produced by processing the entire week’s transactions as
recorded at the branch, the paper copies of the cash account are printed, and the
electronic copy is sent to the data centre. Each day, the gateway terminal has
added up the day’s transactions according to where they should appear in the
cash account, and summarises them at the end of the week. The data centre also
produces a weekly cash account based on all the transactions received from the

branch during the week. There are therefore effectively..three weekly cash

accounts:

a) The official branch weekly cash account;
b) The branch daily account, summarised at theend of the week; and

c) The data centre weekly cash account.

ached the data centre and had been
My checks covered at least two

whether I checked ‘week 47 or 48.

Cheques were handled correctly as far as the system was concerned. I checked
the remittance out of the cheques, which is normally done several times a week,
as the sub-postmaster had reported a problem with this on 10" February (call
reference e-0402130267) (page ). I found that on that one day, the cheque
listing report was not cut off after the day’s cheques had been remmed out. ‘Cut
off’ involves pressing a button on the system to confirm that you have completed
processing of the report, so that when the report is next printed, it will include
only transactions done after the cut-off point. Since the report was not cut off,
when next printed, it still included the cheques that had already been despatched.
I confirmed that the total value of cheques remmed out of the system equalled

the values of cheques received, and so the failure in process did not cause any
financial discrepancy.

Following up a further point from call reference e-0402130267, I noticed that
occasionally, when they declared the cash held in the office at the end of the
working day, they did not always use the same declaration identification number.
For example if a sub-postmaster uses number 01 and enters £10,000 and then
changes their number and uses 11 to record it elsewhere, the system will think
that, at that point, the branch has £20,000 whereas it only has £10,000. I
checked to make sure this had not been done when they de: lared the cash at the
end of the financial week, and it had not.

I went through the cash elements of transactions day by day and compared them
with the overnight cash declarations (ignoring any duplicated declarations as
to find that the cash holding

‘was reasonably close to what

described in paragraph 12 above). I expe

was holding £50,000 cash, and di
£6,000 cash received ai

sub-postmaster was not accurately recording all transactions on the system at the
time the cash as physically being put into or taken out of the till. This is not
necessarily a problem, as long as everything is entered and declared correctly by
the end of the financial week, but does suggest that they are not working

accurately, and it meant I could not link the weekly loss to any particular day.

There was no evidence whatsoever of any system problem, but the continuing
losses and calls suggested they needed some business assistance. I therefore
contacted a colleague, Julie Welsh, in Fujitsu Customer Services, and asked her to
inform Post Office. I updated the call with a summary of my investigation and
returned it to HSH, requesting they contact the sub-postmaster and explain that
we had investigated and the discrepancies were caused by the difference between

the transactions they had recorded on the system and the cash they declared, and
were not being caused by the software or hardware.

Conclusion

16. There are no reasonable grounds for believing that the information recorded and
stored on the Horizon system would subsequently become inaccurate because of
improper use of the computer terminal. To the best of my knowledge and belief,

during the material time, the Horizon system was operat! properly at the Marine

Drive branch or if not, any respect in which it was n rating properly was not

WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANDREW WISE

I, ANDREW WISE, of Human Resources,

~ WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

se jen ERS UN
1. I am currently a Training Mana employed by Post Office Limited (the Post
Office). I have worked for since 199. I am responsible for

training sub-postmasters and ‘«stafffand co-ordinating national
training issues. From May 2001 to Noveinber 2004, I was a postal officer at the
National Business.Support Centre (NBSC). However due to my experience and
knowledge, I was often asked to stand in as a team leader. My responsibilities
included those of a service support advisor involved in answering calls which were
generally, more complex then the first tier of calls that sub-postmasters make
NBSC. Prior to: that, I was:a Horizon field support officer from 1999 to 2001 and
prior to that I spent 8 years as a counter clerk. I have a working knowledge of
the computer system known as Horizon, which is a computerised accounting
ised by the Post Office.

otherwise stated. References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to

3. The Post Office provides a service to sub-postmasters and clerks called the NBSC,
which is a helpline they can call to try to resolve business related queries.

4. There are two tiers of service support at NBSC. Tier one is essentially customer
services and is a separate entity. Tier two is run by the Post Office and is for calls
that tier one are unable to deal with. I understand that an individual at tier one
could take approximately 2,000 calls each day fis it correct to say that an
individual will take 2,000 calls per day or that tier one overall will take
2,000 per day] and at tier two, an individual could take approximately 30 calls

The sub-postmaster then prints foreign currency {what is this? Is it a list of
what foreign currency they have?] and to check the figures against their
actual stock holdings. They then make new declarations for cash and stamps,
entering on the system the cash nominations they have and a number of each
different type of stamps. They then print a report which is kept with their branch.
They then print the balance report and have to check that all the totals are
correct.

On the last Wednesday of the trading period, the lottery figures must be included
prior to final rollover into the next trading period.

Each week, the sub-postmaster sends to Chesterfield tl paid postal and money
orders slips, a Giro Bank Change Summary [what is that?],°UKPA Check and

The Horizon System

18.

Accordingly, “i i be seen that if the clerk or sub-postmaster makes a mistake

when imputing transaction details into their computer, there are a number of
points at which this can be picked up, because there are daily and weekly reports
that the sub-postmaster have to produce at which stage they have to check and
satisfy themselves that the documents eg cheques, cash, giros, they have match

what they have entered on the system.

In addition to that, there are various teams responsible for different sorts of
paperwork, including a giro bank team, cheques team and pension team. For
example, if the clerk records an item as a cheque rather than cash, they should
pick this up on either their daily or weekly report. However if they fail to do so,
this will be picked up at the EDS Processing Centre. Merely because an item has

1A_1198369_1 4

POL00071231
POL00071231
been recorded as a cheque rather than cash (or visa versa) would not of course
cause an overall loss to the branch. If an item has been wrongly recorded, an
error notice would be generated, although this can easily take up to 12 weeks or
so. This will mean that if there has been an over or underpayment there will be
either a claim or charge error respectively.

Horizon System Helpdesk and National Business Support Centre

4. An important element of the support provided to subpostmasters and Counter
Clerks is the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). The HSH is the Horizon user’s first
‘port of call’ in the event of their experiencing a problem with the Horizon system
or requiring advice and guidance. If the system were to malfunction, upon

Tivoli Event Logs

For many other events that do not require immediate attention,
this operating system adds information to an event-log file to provide information
without disturbing normal work. This event logging service starts automatically
each time a computer running Windows NT is started. In the Horizon system
these events are collected by the Tivoli Event Monitor and are captured by the
Audit Server and stored as part of the overall Audit Trail.

Non Polling Reports

8. A daily report is produced that lists those branches that have not polled for 24
hours, and the number of days they have been ‘out of contact’. Polling ; Branches

4A1194765_1 2
are ‘contacted’ periodically by the Correspondence Layer (where all transactions
for all branches are stored prior to despatch to other systems) to deposit
and collect information pertinent to that branch. This reduces the telephony costs
incurred were branches to be permanently connected to the Correspondence
Layer. Branches can operate in a disconnected state for up to 27 days.

18. The call was escalated to Heather Dryden at HSH. As a sub-postmaster is
supposed to send cheques to the EDS Processing Centre each evening, the next
day you would expect to see the cheque figures cleared to zero on the forizon
system. The sub-postmaster, $¢ initially stated that this had happened more than
once, but when Heather went through his cheques, it had happened just the once.
It appears that the sub-postmaster forgot to cut off and the cheque listing had

the sub-postmaster reveals that he has not cut off the previous days cheques,
they will show up the next day and a failure to cut off previously cannot be
corrected later. However, the point is that the system will not put the cheques in
the balance and process them twice. It will reconcile each cheque against the
transaction.

The clerk was advised that she would need to check her stock position for last

with the stock on hand. The clerk was advised that we would need her to take
her computer terminal to trial balance this evening and come back to us before
she rolls over so that we can take down any details she can give us. The clerk
confirmed that they are working on a shared stock unit and would call back if

sub-postmaster advised that the problem had started ever since the BT engineer
came to move the BT box for preparation for the installation of the ADSL.

Kuljinder recommended that SSC investigate why the sub-postmaster is
experiencing large discrepancies. A known error log (KEL) reference was given
and the problem was re-assigned within HSH to group EDSC1 [what does this
stand for?),

At this point I investigated the matter. The critical event earlier that day was
part of a storm ie a central problem causing lots of event storms which had
occurred over the entire Horizon system that night as a result of a faulty software
fix. The KEL had nothing to do with the discrepancies.

27. Various built in checks occur at the end of each day. For example, the gate way
terminal will total all the transactions. The gate way terminal will only send in
information from these built in checks, once all the terminals in the branch have
communicated with it. Reports are only produced if there are discrepancies. A
weekly cash account is produced and sent to the data centre. The gate way
terminal will do daily cash accounts. This is summarised weekly and compared to
the weekly branch cash account to check for discrepancies. The data centre also
produces a weekly cash account which is compared to the branch weekly cash
accounts. There are therefore effectively three weekly cash accounts:

a) The branch weekly cash accounts;

Conclusion

There are no reasonable grounds for believing that the information stored on the
Horizo

system would be inaccurate because of improper use of the computer
terminal. To the. best of my knowledge and belief, during the material time, the
Horizon system was operating properly at the Marine Drive branch or if not, any
respect in which it was not operating properly was not such as to affect the
production of audit record or accuracy of their contents.

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.

WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANDREW WISE :

1. I am currently a Training Manager employed byPost Office Limited (the Post
Office). I have worked for the Post Office since 1991. I am responsible for
training new sub-postmasters and branch counter staff on Horizon and co-
ordinating national training issues. : From May 2001 to November 2004, I was a
postal officer at the Network Business Support Centre (NBSC). However due to
my experience’and knowledge, I was often asked to stand in as a team leader.
My responsibilities included those of a service support advisor involved in
answering calls which were generally more complex then the first tier of calls that
sub-postmasters make to the NBSC. Prior to that, I was a Horizon field support
officer from 1999 to .2001 and prior to that I spent 8 years as a counter clerk. I

a working knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a

computerised accounting system used by the Post Office.
2. I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless

otherwise stated. References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to
page numbers of Exhibit “AW1” to this Witness Statement.

Network Business Support Centre

3. The Post Office provides a service to sub-postmasters and clerks called the NBSC,
which is a helpline they can call to try to resolve business related queries.

4, There are two tiers of service support at NBSC. Tier one is essentially customer
services and is a separate entity. Tier two was run by the Post Office and was for
calls that tier one were unable to deal with. I understand that an individual at tier
one could take approximately 2,000 calls each day [is it correct toe say that an
individual will take 2,000 calls per day or that tier one overail will take
2,000 per day ~ This is the overaif cails] and at tier two, an individual could
take approximately 30 calls each day. Basically a sub-postmaster would call the
NBSC telephone number, select the options to get-through to tier one and then
explain their problem. It may be a pre-recorded standard response, but if there is
none available, the sub-postmaster could get put through to tier two. A lot of
time on tier two is spent prompting su! postmasters ‘and clerks to double check
information they should have been checking any way.

Double entry accounting and daily: eporting procedures

5. Ihave been asked to explain what Horizon is and the daily and weekly reporting
procedures that sub-postmasters must adhere to.

6. The counter positions in the post office branches each have a computer terminal,
this includes the processor, a touch sensitive screen, a keyboard, barcode scanner
and printer. Once a clerk jogs on, any transactions they perform are recorded
and entered into the computer. The computer system is called Horizon.

7. Post Office branches operate double entry accounting. Almost every transaction
recorded by the. clerk on to their computer has a corresponding physical
document, such as a TV license counter foil, savings bank deposit, withdrawal slip

or cheque.

8. Asummary of the prescribed daily procedures that sub-postmasters must follow is
at pages 1 to 2. This includes the following:

TV Licenses - Non Barcode

9. Each day the sub-postmaster must enter details on the green daily summary form
P5744 which is retained at the branch. They have to print a daily report and
check that the totals of the counter foils agree with that report [was this the
system in place at the time? Does the daily report info come from

1A_1204619_4 2
POL00071231
POL00071231

Horizon? - This system was in place at the time. The report is produced
from the Horizon system and shows all the transactions of that type that
have been recorded for that day.]. If they do, they cut off the report on the
computer to reset it to zero for the next day. They then complete a batch control
voucher (BCV) paperclip together none barcoded TV and non barcoded over 75
counter foils to the BCV and send the counter foils to the Processing Centre. [did
they send them to EDS at the time? For cheques, I understand the
migration to EDS took place around Feb 2004. ~ Before EDS we use to
send them to Data Central, this was a processing centre run by Post
Office Ltd. I am not sure of the exact date we started using EDS, from a
branch point of view they just used a different envelope.]

Personal Banking

10. The sub-postmaster has to print a report each day and check that the totals on
the print out agree with the documents.to hand (whether cash deposit, cheque
deposit envelope or encashment cheques) ‘if the totals agree, they then have to
cut off the report so that it resets for the next day. They then complete a BCV and
paperclip the cash deposit slips, check deposit envelopes and then encashed
cheques together and place in the envelope to.go to the Processing Centre.

Chi

11. The sub-postmas
bank deposits and ‘i
and Withdrawals ie fo each of these, the sub-postmaster has to print a report,

lips, cash or other documents agree with the report,

check that the cheques, giro.
paperclip the relevant documents together with the BCV and send them to the
correct.place such as girobank or the Processing Centre.

[Andrew, ‘would you feel qualified to be able to summarise what
happened to these docs once they arrived at Transaction Processing? -I
have never been to the processing centre to see their operation so I don’t
feel I would qualified to summarise this.]

Weekly Balance Procedure

12. Each week the sub-postmaster has to go through a balancing procedure. [Is this
something they do weekly or daily or both? - The balancing procedure is
weekly.J. A summary of this procedure is at pages 3 to 6. [what is a
Transaction Correction? Is a trading period from week to week or do you
mean each day? - The process for balancing changed in September 06

1A_1204619_1 3
POL00071231

POL00071231

and changed to monthly, Transaction Corrections were introduced then
and were not on the system in Feb 04].

13. They then have to complete the counter daily and counter weekly reports [are
those the reports that are mentioned above or are they something else?
What are the daily reports? And what do they look like? - The counter
daily reports are the ones listed above.]. [What are the weekly reports
and what do they look like and what information do they contain? - All
transactions that are sent off weekly are classed as counter weekly
reports. These include things such as Pensions and Allowances, Green
Giros, Postal Orders. These are listed on the Weekly jalancing hand out.
The reports look the same as those produced for. Daily reports.]. They are
then are encouraged to print a balance snapshot and use that to ensure that the
Horizon system stock held figures matches thé actual stock holdings in their
branch. They also have to check all receiptand payment transaction totals with

office weekly reports are

weekly reports [what are these? ~ The manda
the suspense account report and cted post “ge label report. These are
produced off the A4 printer and retained in the office with the cash

account.].

14, The sub-postma ster then completes. all other manual summaries and
reconciliations, for, examp! _ National Savings Weekly Summary, Change Given
Return, Electric © Tokens, Promotional/Payment Vouchers, MVL Weekly
Reconciliation: Rod Lices Reconciliation, Gift Voucher Weekly Reconciliation,
DVLA Premium “Service Sumimaries, UK PA Check and Send summaries, Electric

Schemes and National Lottery Cheque Prize Payments.

15. The sulipostmastér ‘then prints foreign currency [what is this? Is it a list of
what foreign currency they have? - This is only done for Offices that have

On Demand Bureau de Change and this is used to balance their foreign
currency.] and to check the figures against their actual stock holdings. They
then make new declarations for cash and stamps, entering on the system the
cash nominations they have and a number of each different type of stamps. They
then print a report which is kept with their branch.

16. The office then produces a Trial Balance report, if all the cash stock and figures

are correct and once the National Lottery figures have been entered the office can
then be rolled over and a Final Balance report is produced.

POL00071231
POL00071231

17. Each week, the sub-postmaster sends to Chesterfield the paid postal and money
orders slips, a Giro Bank Change Summary [what is that? - The Post Office
offers a change giving service to customers that bank with Girobank, this
is a summary of how many transactions are done.J, UKPA Check and Send

customer can apply for a phota card driving licence at the Post office, we

[Andrew please can you check that.these were the procedures in place in
December 2003 to March 2004; which the period that we are looking at
and if they weren’t can you.amend accordingly and insert what
procedures were.actually in placeat that time ~ The weekiy balancing

have-amended a few things that made reference to Branch Trading as
that was not applicable Hen. J.

ents, this is something that was introduced

The Horizon System

19, Accordingly, it can be seen that if the clerk or sub-postmaster makes a mistake
when imputing transaction details into their computer, there are a number of
points at which this can be picked up, because there are daily and weekly reports
that the sub-postmaster have to produce at which stage they have to check and
satisfy themselves that the documents eg cheques, giros, pensions and
allowances match what they have entered on the system. In addition to that,
there are various teams responsible for different sorts of paperwork, including a
giro bank team, cheques team and pension team. For example, if the clerk
records an item incorrectly on the system, they should pick this up on either their
daily or weekly report. However if they fail to do so, this will be picked up at the
Processing Centre. If an item has been wrongly recorded, an error notice would be

1A_1204619_1 5
POL00071231

POL00071231

generated, although this can easily take up to 12 weeks or so. This will mean
that if a transaction has been over or under stated there will be either a claim or
charge error respectively.

Sub-Postmaster Training

[Andrew can you add some details of what the sub-postmasters and clerks
have to be trained on when they join the post office. ~ The training would
include how to use the Horizon system and would include a lot of transaction
based procedures such as ~ Cheque acceptance, Girobank, National Savings,
pensions and Allowances, Postage, TV licences, letters. and parcels,Personal
banking. Also things such as the daily accounting

cedure and weekly

balancing along with how to use the counter operation manuals and things

like customer care and security and Health and Safety.]

NBSC Review

irs Oglesby asked NBSC for

20. My understanding was around 4 March 2004

je. She then reported to Andrew Price (NBSC) who
glesbyon 20 April 2004. (page 13). The e-mail
states that Sarah Pennington spoke to the sub-postmaster at Marine Drive who

wasn’t sure whe it was causing the errors and that he had been using the slave
computer terminal to enter his stock and cash, which he was told would not cause
a problem as long as it was attached to the correct stock unit. If there was any
communication problem between the two computers, the words “node
disconnected" would flash up on screen when any reports were produced.

21. The sub-postmaster apparently thought there were some errors relating to the
National Lottery. I understand from the e-mail that Sarah phoned the lottery
team at transaction processing who confirmed that there were some errors, but
for every charge error there was a corresponding claim error as the clerk and/or
sub-postmaster had entered the lottery figures in the wrong cash account period.
If the cash account period (week number) is wrong one week, the next week this
would balance out, hence the sub-postmaster would receive a charge error in the
first week and a claim error in the second week.

1A_1204619_1 6
POL00071231
POL00071231

22. Sarah’s e-mail records that the sub-postmaster was also concerned that when
entering the lottery figures, the terminals did not appear to be communicating.
However if that had been the case, the sub-postmaster would have a very large
number of errors on every report and product.

23. I looked at the cash account information that the sub-postmaster sent to me but
was unable to find any errors. {do you still have this or your analysis? ~ I
don’t have anything relating to this.]. The only amount questioned was a
large amount on the cheques to Processing Centre, but I was able to confirm that
this was a cheque payment for the purchase of the premium bonds. Accordingly,
there is nothing more NBSC could do and we suggested he: wo k a manual system
at the side of Horizon to see if any problems were hig lighted. He was also

advised to take a snapshot before and after he did. f

any problems occurring when he did a remittance.

24. We concluded that the Horizon system was working properly and did not appear
to be the cause of the unauthorised losses incurred.

base is? ~ If KB is in the resolution then the answer has been given off
the knowledge base. The KB is a tool used by NBSC to give answers to
SPMR and find information there are 1000‘s of case titles on the system
which gives information and what answers to give. The advisor will use
remedy (this is the system used to log cails and is linked to the KB) to
categorise a call made by a SPMR. If the correct categorisation is used
then the system should give the advisor the answer to the question. J.

by the EDS. They retained the ID form and PID and the application form was
represented, but it had been returned again because there was no PID or ID form,
although the sub-postmaster said that EDS had retained them. The caller advised
the sub-postmaster that as the application had been erroneously rejected, NBSC
would pass his comments to our customer relations team to progress as a
complaint against EDS.

postmaster was advised that if he felt that that was a technical problem he should
call the Horizon System Helpline (HSH) that deals with technical issues.
However, after NBSC spoke to the sub-postmaster it appeared that he was
entering all the transactions correctly, so this could be the case. [What does
that mean? ~ The advisor would have gone through the rem procedure
with the SPMR and it looks like he established/he was remming the cash

WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANDREW WISE

GRO

WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

I am currently a Training Manager employed by Post Office Limited (the Post
Office). I have worked for the Post Office since 1991. I am responsible for
training new sub-postmasters and branch counter staff on Post Office
Transactions and procedures and the Horizon system and co-ordinating national
training issues. From May 2001 to November 2004, I was a postal officer at the
Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) working as a Tier 2 Advisor. However
due to my experience and knowledge, I was often asked to stand in as a team
leader. My responsibilities included those of a service support advisor involved in
answering calls which were generally more complex then the first tier of calls that
sub-postmasters make to the NBSC. Prior to that, I was a Horizon field support
officer from 1999 to 2001 and prior to that I spent 8 years as a counter clerk. I
have a working knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a
computerised accounting system used by the Post Office.

I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless

otherwise stated. References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to
page numbers of Exhibit “AW1” to this Witness Statement.

Unknown document property name. 1

POL00071231
POL00071231

Network Business Support Centre

3. The Post Office provides a service to sub-postmasters and clerks called the NBSC,
which is a helpline they can call to try to resolve business related queries.

4. There are two tiers of service support at NBSC. Tier one is essentially customer
services and is a separate entity. Tier two was run by the Post Office and was for
calls that tier one were unable to deal with. I understand that the tier one team
could between them take approximately 2,000 calls in total each day and at tier
two, an individual could take approximately 30 calls each day. Basically a sub-
postmaster would call the NBSC telephone number, select the options to get
through to tier one and then explain their problem. It may be a pre-recorded
standard response, but if there is none available, the sub-postmaster could get
put through to tier two. A lot of time on tier two is spent prompting sub-
postmasters and clerks to double check information they should have been

checking any way.

Double entry accounting and daily reporting procedures

5. I have been asked to explain what Horizon is and the daily and weekly reporting
procedures that sub-postmasters must adhere to.

6. The counter positions in the post office branches each have a computer terminal,
this includes the processor, a touch sensitive screen, a keyboard, barcode scanner
and printer. Once a clerk logs on, any transactions they perform are recorded
and entered into the computer. The computer system is called Horizon.

7. Post Office branches operate double entry accounting. Almost every transaction
recorded by the clerk on to their computer has a corresponding physical
document, such as a TV license counter foil, savings bank deposit, withdrawal slip

or cheque.

8. Asummary of the prescribed daily procedures that sub-postmasters must follow is
at pages 1 to 2. This includes the following:

TV Licenses - Non Barcode

9. Each day the sub-postmaster must enter details on the green daily summary form
P5744 which is retained at the branch. They have to print a daily report and
check that the totals of the counter foils agree with that report. The report is
produced from information contained upon the Horizon system and shows all the

Error! Unknown document property name. 2
POL00071231
POL00071231

transactions of that type that have been recorded for the day. If the report and
the counter foils tally with each other, the subpostmaster cuts off the report on
the computer to reset it to zero for the next day. (‘Cut off’ means that the
subpostmaster presses a button on the computer to confirm that he has
completed the report, so that when the report is next printed, it will include only
transactions done after the cut-off point). They then complete a batch control
voucher (BCV) paperclip together none barcoded TV and non barcoded over 75
counter foils to the BCV and send the counter foils off to be processed. Up until a
few years ago, they sent them to Data Central, a processing centre in London run
by the Post Office. However, I am advised that from around February 2004
onwards there was a phased migration over to the EDS Processing Centre (EDS)
in Shepshed, Leicestershire because the task of processing was outsourced by the
Post Office to the EDS. From a branch point of view, this just meant putting the
BCV and Counterfoils in a different envelope.

Personal Banking

10. The sub-postmaster has to print a report each day and check that the totals on
the print out agree with the documents to hand (whether cash deposit, cheque
deposit envelope or encashment cheques) if the totals agree, they then have to
cut off the report so that it resets for the next day. They then complete a BCV and
paperclip the cash deposit slips, check deposit envelopes and then encashed
cheques together and place in the envelope to go off to be processed.

Cheques, Giro bank deposits and Savings Bank

11. The sub-postmaster then goes through a similar daily procedure for cheques, giro
bank deposits and withdrawals, daily cash declaration and Savings Bank Deposits
and Withdrawals i.e. for each of these, the sub-postmaster has to print a report,
check that the cheques, giro slips, cash or other documents agree with the report,
paperclip the relevant documents together with the BCV and send them to the
correct place such as girobank, Data Central or (nowadays) EDS.

Weekly Balance Procedure

12. Each week the sub-postmaster has to go through a weekly balancing procedure.
A summary of the current procedure is at pages 3 to 6. (The current procedure
refers to “Branch Trading” and “monthly Trading Statements”, which is a monthly
balancing process introduced in September 2005 to replace the weekly
procedure). Most of the balancing processes are still the same today but I have
tried to describe below the procedure as it was at the material time i.e. from
December 2003 to March 2004.

Error! Unknown document property name. 3
POL00071231

POL00071231

13. The subpostmaster has to complete further copies of the counter daily reports (of
the sort listed in paragraphs 9 to 11 above) (7 assume they are further copies
because they are also done daily, but correct me if this is wrong - Yes
they are done again on a balance day. Counter daily reports are normaily
done in time for the iast despatch from the office, this could be as early
as 16:00. if more transactions are done after this time then they need to
be produced again before the balance can be completed.) and counter
weekly reports. All transactions that are sent off weekly are classed as counter
weekly reports. These include things such as Pensions and Allowances, Green
Giros, Postal Orders. These are listed on the Weekly Balancing hand out. The
reports look the same as those produced for Daily reports. They are then are
encouraged to print a balance snapshot and use that to ensure that the Horizon
system stock held figures matches the actual stock holdings in their branch. They
also have to check all receipt and payment transaction totals with the supporting
vouchers/documentation. There are ways in which they can amend any stock
discrepancies. They then have to print the mandatory office weekly reports being
the suspense account report and rejected postage label report. These are
produced off the A4 printer and retained in the branch with the cash account.

14. The sub-postmaster then completes all other manual summaries and
reconciliations, for example National Savings Weekly Summary, Change Given
Return, Electric Tokens, Promotional/Payment Vouchers, MVL Weekly
Reconciliation, Rod Licence Reconciliation, Gift Voucher Weekly Reconciliation,
DVLA Premium Service Summaries, UK PA Check and Send summaries, Electric
Schemes and National Lottery Cheque Prize Payments.

If a branch has an On Demand Bureau de Change, the sub-postmaster then prints
a foreign currency report and checks the figures against their actual stock
holdings. [Andrew, please can you check whether between December
2004 and March 2004, the Marine Drive branch had an On Demand
Bureau de Change ~ I have checked with the product manager and he can

15.

only confirm that he is a Pre Order office at this time not on demand. He
does not have records to see if he was on demand or not at this between
Dec 03 and March 04. On the 9 March 2004 the SPMR made a call to
NBCS regarding accounting for a pre order transaction, this (te me)
would indicate that the office was pre order in March 2004 not on
demand.].

16. They then make new declarations for cash and stamps, entering on the system

the cash nominations they have and a number of each different type of stamps.
They then print a report which is kept with their branch.

Error! Unknown document property name. 4
POL00071231
POL00071231

17. The office then produces a Trial Balance report, if all the cash stock and figures
are correct and once the National Lottery figures have been entered the office can
then be rolled over and a Final Balance report is produced.

18. Each week, the sub-postmaster sends to Chesterfield the paid postal and money
orders slips, a Giro Bank Change Summary (the Post Office offers a change giving
service to customers that bank with Girobank and this is a summary of how many
transactions are done), UKPA Check and Send (this is the Passport Check and
Send service) Please can you ascertain whether between December 2003
and March 2004 Marine Drive branch had this? ~ This office does not offer
this service - again we do not have records from march 03 but it is
unlikely that a sub office would offer this service. a form setting out
Redeemed Post Office and TV Savings Stamps, National Lottery prize payments
(£500 plus) (which shows details of what cheques have been issued to National
Lottery winners where the prize is more than £500) and DVLA premium service
forms (which is a service where a customer can apply for a photo card driving
licence at the Post office. The branch checks the form and ID and sends it off.

19. After everything has been completed and the office is happy with the balance they
will then complete the weekly Cash Account report. 2 copies are produced and
signed. 1 of these copies is sent to Transaction Processing at Chesterfield and the
other is retained in the office.

The Horizon System

20. Accordingly, it can be seen that if the clerk or sub-postmaster makes a mistake
when imputing transaction details into their computer, there are a number of
points at which this can be picked up, because there are daily and weekly reports
that the sub-postmaster have to produce at which stage they have to check and
satisfy themselves that the documents for example, cheques, giros, pensions and
allowances match what they have entered on the system. In addition to that,
there are various teams responsible for different sorts of paperwork produced by
the branch, including a giro bank team, cheques team and pension team. For
example, if the clerk records an item incorrectly on the system, they should pick
this up on either their daily or weekly report. However if they fail to do so, this
will be picked up at the Processing Centre. If an item has been wrongly recorded,
an error notice would be generated, although this can easily take up to 12 weeks.
or so. This will mean that if a transaction has been over or under stated there will
be either a claim or charge error respectively.

POL00071231

Sub-Postmaster Training

21. As previously stated, I am currently responsible for training new sub-postmasters
and branch counter staff on Horizon. The training includes how to use the Horizon
system and would include a lot of transaction based procedures such as ~ Cheque
acceptance, Girobank, National Savings, pensions and Allowances, Postage, TV
licences, letters and parcels and Personal banking. It also covers subjects like
customer care and security, Health and Safety, how to use the counter operation
manuals and procedures such as the daily accounting and (at the time in
question) weekly balancing. [Are you able to say whether Mr Castieton
attended such training? From December 2003 to March 2004, where did
the training take place? Did it involve a day, a few days or a week? Is it
individual or in groups ~ In the training delivery team we have a record
of this office transferring on the 18 july 2003, this gives the incoming
SPMR’s name as Mr Lee Castleton. The records show that Mr Castieton
was offered 4 days in a classroom from the 14 July to the 17° July at
our classroom in leeds, on this course there were 3 other delegates (we
do not have anything to say he definitely attended the classroom). Mr
Castleton then had a trainer on site with him from 18 July to 25" July.)

22. Each branch has a copy of the Horizon User Guide which is a reference tool and
explains how to use Horizon, (such as balancing, administration, reports, transfers
remittances and transactions) and a Horizons Operations Manual which gives
guidance on products such as girobank, national savings accounts, personal
banking, corporate banking, cash and cheques acceptance, pensions and counter
operations. In addition, literature such as Operation Focus a weekly magazine
circulated to all branches and operational Workaid, a similar magazine but
circulated as and when there are more major changes to products, prices or
procedures, help keep branches abreast of developments.

NBSC Review

21. My understanding was around 4 March 2004 Mrs Oglesby asked NBSC for
information relating to Marine Drive Post Office. The information requested was
regarding calls made to the NBSC from the Marine Drive branch relating to losses
when balancing and what investigations were undertaken by NBSC during these
calls. Sarah Pennington (who has since left the Post Office) was the Tier 2 advisor
who dealt with some of the calls raised by this office at the time and during these
calls she discussed the issues with me. She then reported to Andrew Price
(NBSC) who in turn reported back to Mrs Oglesby on 20 April 2004 (page 13).
The e-mail states that Sarah Pennington spoke to the sub-postmaster at Marine
Drive who wasn’t sure what was causing the errors and that he had been using

Error! Unknown document property name. 6

the slave computer terminal to enter his stock and cash, which he was told would
not cause a problem as long as it was attached to the correct stock unit. If there
was any communication problem between the two computers, the words “node
disconnected” would flash up on screen when any reports were produced.

The sub-postmaster apparently thought there were some errors relating to the
National Lottery. I understand from the e-mail that Sarah phoned the lottery
team at transaction processing who confirmed that there were some errors, but
for every charge error there was a corresponding claim error as the clerk and/or
sub-postmaster had entered the lottery figures in the wrong cash account period.
If the cash account period (week number) is wrong one week, the next week this
would balance out, hence the sub-postmaster would receive a charge error in the
first week and a claim error in the second week.

Sarah’s e-mail records that the sub-postmaster was also concerned that when
entering the lottery figures, the terminals did not appear to be communicating.
However if that had been the case, the sub-postmaster would have a very large
number of errors on every report and product.

I looked at the cash account information that the sub-postmaster sent to me but
was unable to find any errors. The only amount questioned was a large amount
on the cheques to Processing Centre, but I was able to confirm that this was a
cheque payment for the purchase of the premium bonds. Accordingly, there is
nothing more NBSC could do and we suggested he work a manual system at the
side of Horizon to see if any problems were highlighted. He was also advised to
take a snapshot before and after he did the REMs to see if there were any
problems occurring when he did a remittance. (When a subpostmaster receives
a delivery of cash and/or stock, he enters the details and quantity into his
computer and this is called “remming in” the stock). [Andrew, do you feel able
to also talk about what paperwork the branch would, at the material
time, have received with each cash and stock delivery, whether they had
to sign anything to acknowledge receipt, if so what and/or how their
cash and stock orders are placed? ~ The cash and stock are delivered to
the office in a grey pouch by the Cash In Transit driver. The SPMR would
sign a docket to say that they have received this pouch (each pouch had a
reference number and this tied up with what the cash centre had put in
the pouch so the Driver never knew what was in each pouch). The SPMR
would then open the pouch and there would be an advice note in the
pouch listing what cash or stock should be in that pouch. The SPMR had
24 hours to check that the amount agreed with the advice note (if it did
not he had to contact the Rem Unit within 24 hours of receiving the
pouch, The SPMR would then rem this amount into the Horizon system

POL00071231

and it produced a rem in slip that was attached te the advice note and
was retained in the office with all other paper work. This procedure
changed around August 2004 to an automated system where the
barcodes on the pouches were scanned in on Horizon and the value was
automatically entered on the system. |

25. We concluded that the Horizon system was working properly and did not appear
to be the cause of the unauthorised losses incurred.

NBSC Call Logs

26. I have been asked to provide an overview of the call logs from the Marine Drive
branch and an overview of them from December 2003 to April 2004 are set out
below ~ FAD code 213337. These were compiled during the ordinary course of
business from information supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be
supposed to have personal knowledge of the matter dealt with in the information
supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the information or cannot be
traced, I probably dealt with very few of these calls (if any at all) and the
accordingly the information set out below questions is based on my interpretation
(from experience) of what is written in the call logs and is provided simply to help
clarify them for the benefit of the Court.

27. 1 December 2003, call reference H12881564 the sub-postmaster wanted to
know where they sent their application for telephone claims. The resolution was
stated to be KB which means that an answer was provided from the knowledge
base. Given the volume and variety of calls to NBSC, the KB is a tool used by
NBSC to find information and give answers to subpostmasters. There are
thousands of case titles [what is a case title? - When an advisor gets an answer
off the KB this is displayed on a word document. There is a word document for
every piece of information that is held on the KB and these are the KB cases and
the case title is the heading on each case. For example the case title for this
question could be ‘What are the Contact Details for Telephone Claims’
When you search on the KB it will give you a list of case titles to choose
from and you select which one you want to go into.] on the KB system
which gives information and what answers to give. [Would you describe it as a
bit like a computerised library for the P.O or a more tailored and
sophisticated version of “Frequently Asked Questions” that you see on
websites? ~ It is like both of these] The NBSC advisor will use a system called
“Remedy” (which is the system used to log calls and is linked to the KB) to
categorise a call made by a subpostmaster. If the correct categorisation is used,
then the system should give the advisor the answer to the question. The use of
the KB enables NBSC to effectively apply and maintain consistent service

standards across the board when dealing with subpostmaster queries [F assume
that’s its purpose? - Yes].

i December 2003, call reference H12881573 the caller wanted a telephone
number for human resources. An answer was given from the knowledge base.

11 December 2003, call reference H12903595 there was a power failure on
the street and the office has electronic shutters so the branch was unable to open.
Each branch has 2 or 3 nominated offices so if an office is closed the customers
will be directed to a nominated office to transact their business. NBSC would give
the nominated office details to the subpostmaster so he could display a notice

telling customers where to go.

11 December 2003, call reference H12904136 the clerk called to confirm that
the branch had been reopened.

12 December 2003, call reference H12906756 the clerk wanted to know
what the counter procedure was for a local collect when a customer comes to pick
it up. Local collect is a service offered by the post office: if Royal Mail can not
deliver a package, they can leave this at the local Post Office branch and the
customer can collect it from there. They were provided with an answer from the

knowledge base.

13 December 2003, call reference H12908771 this was a call because the
customer had received a card in the name of Vera instead of Violet. This was
resolved by providing the clerk with an answer from the knowledge base.

13 December 2003, call reference H12908772 the office was open but was
showing up as closed. This call would have been created by the advisor who
answered the previous call. When they took the first call, it would have flagged up
on the computer that the office was still closed where in fact it was open. This call
would have been passed to the administration team and they would change the

office status to open.

22 December 2003, call reference H12925312 the postmaster sent off an
application with the Personal Invitation Document (PID), which is used to apply
for a Post Office Card Account Card for the opening of an account and
identification form which was erroneously rejected by the EDS. They retained the
ID form and PID and the application form was represented, but it had been
returned again because there was no PID or ID form, although the sub-
postmaster said that EDS had retained them. The caller advised the sub-
postmaster that as the application had been erroneously rejected, NBSC would

POL00071231

pass his comments to our customer relations team to progress as a complaint
against EDS.

35, 22 December 2003, call reference H12925361 this is a record of the sub-
postmaster’s complaint about EDS being forwarded to them.

36. 23 December 2003, call reference H21243010 the postmaster wanted to

know if the procedures for printing a postage label had changed and was advised

that the pre-paid will be reduced by an amount of extra service (recorded).

37, 30 December 2003, call reference H12937387 the clerk called to say that the
customer had changed addresses and also post offices for his card (which I
believe would have been his Post Office Card Account). His new card had been
sent to the old office and the clerk wanted to know how he could have had the
card directed to the new office. This was resolved by providing the clerk with
information from the knowledge base.

38. 30 December 2003, call reference H12937703 the sub-postmaster had
received a few enquiries from customers regarding the changes to the National
Savings Ordinary Account. The sub-postmaster was advised that NBSC do not
have any further information regarding the changes to the Ordinary Saving
Account other than information contained in MBS 453. MBS stands for “Message
Broadcast System”. When urgent information needs to be sent the network a MBS
is sent out direct to all Post Office branches to their Horizon system. MBS 453 is
the number of the MBS sent out. I do not have a copy of this and doubt whether
they would be kept from 3 years ago, but in any event it would only hold
information relating to National savings Ordinary Account.

39, 14 January 2004, call reference H12971100 the clerk called in relation to a
discrepancy i.e. a loss of £1,103.13. They were provided with an answer from the
knowledge base. The call log does not record what the subpostmaster said.
From memory, the advice on the KB for an office that misbalanced was that the
subpostmaster should to check all cash stamps and stock, check rems and
cheques to processing centre rems, and check pensions and allowances and other
documentation. Andrew, please can you find out if it definitely does say
this on KB ~ I have been in touch with the NBSC and this case does not
exist on the KB anymore and the team that deals with the KB does not
keep ofd records of old cases. I don’t know if Dave Hulbert will be able to
help more regarding this.?

40. 19 January 2004, call reference Q12980113 there was an incorrect cash
dispatch. It appears from the call log that Lisa, the person calling from the

POL00071231

POL00071231

branch, was not sure of the procedure to despatch cash to Hemel Hemstead (this
is the main cash depot). NBSC advised her of the correct procedure.

41. 20 January 2004, call reference H21265950. This is a request to have a
copy of week 43/03 counter news to be sent to the office. Counter News is a
weekly publication sent to all branches that lists operational changes, it could be
the branch lost or did not receive a copy.

42, 20 January 2004, call reference H21265965 the sub-postmaster had not

received a copy of the sales report for the last period and wanted to know how

one could be ordered. The sub-postmaster was advised that the reports were late
and he should receive it by the end of the week at the latest as they were being
dispatched,

43. 21 January 2004, call reference H1i2987381 the sub-postmaster called
because they had a cash account discrepancy of £4,294.67. The call was logged
with the suspense team. (At this time, there was a suspense team to try to
ensure that nothing was transferred into the suspense account that was not

permitted).

44. 22 January 2004, call reference H12987919 the sub-postmaster reported a
loss of £4,000. He said he was in the office until 11pm last night but could not
find anything. The NBSC went through all the balanced cheques with him. It
appeared that the sub-postmaster had checked the REMs in and out, his cash,
stock and pensions and allowances but was unable to find the loss. The sub-
postmaster was therefore advised that this matter would be passed through to
the suspense team. (When cash or stock goes into a branch, it is “remmed” in ie
entered into or out of the system. The sub-postmaster has to check the rem foils
to verify that he receives the cash or stock listed on the foil).

45. 22 January 2004, call reference H12987957 the sub-postmaster called.
There was a loss in week 43 of £4,230.97. This was an unknown error. That
means that the sub-postmaster should not transfer the loss into the suspense

account.
46. 22 January 2004, call reference H21268317 a disabled customer's card had
arrived in an incorrect name of Bernice instead of Denise and the sub-postmaster

wanted to speak to EDS. An answer was given from the knowledge base.

47. 27 January 2004, call reference H12999552 this refers to a training event in
Scarborough.

48. 28 January 2004, call reference H13003838 the sub-postmaster enquired
whether there was a service available for customers to send money to somebody
in another part of the country. That answer was provided from the knowledge
base.

49. 28 January 2004, call reference H21272735 the sub-postmaster had called to
say that since he had broadband installed, every time he receives stock into his
office it was showing short by the same amount. He had checked to make sure
that it was remmed in properly but it was still showing £2,500 short. The sub-
postmaster was advised that if he felt that that was a technical system problem
he should call the Horizon System Helpline (HSH) that deals with technical issues.
However, after NBSC spoke to the sub-postmaster it appeared that he was
entering all the transactions correctly, so this could be the case [What “could be
the case?” ~ The advisor is saying that it could be the case that there is
an issue when he remms in the stock but this has to be raised with HSH
for them to investigate.]. The NBSC advisor would have gone through the rem
procedure with the subpostmaster and it looks like he established he was
remming the cash in correctly. He was advised to “balance and roll for a definite
figure” i.e to produce a trial balance, since it is only at this stage you can get an
accurate picture of what the value of the discrepancy is and to call HSH if he

didn’t have any success.

50. 29 January 2004, cali reference H13005452 the branch called and said they
were showing a loss of £2,523.12 and that this was the third discrepancy in as
many weeks. NBSC checked through the figures using a transaction log and also
looked at the REMs declaration and the cash flow. No trace of the discrepancy was
found and this was referred to the suspense account team to review.

51. 29 January 2004, call reference H13005643 a call was ceated by NBSC and
assigned to the Suspense Account team to deal with. The call notified the
suspense Account Team of the unauthorised or unidentified loss of £6,754.09. [is
this an accurate summary? ~ The cail notifies the suspense account team
that the office has a loss ~ they would then contact the office to
determine if it was an unidentified loss and they would decide if the PM is
authorised to hold the loss or not.]

52. 29 January 2004, call reference H21274188 the sub-postmaster wanted to
have his transactional archives. Horizon only holds about 30 days worth of data
and after this period all the transaction data is archived by Fujitsu. The Post office
can request office archived data from Fujitsu. Who - I assume the SPMR
wanted to look himself to see if he could identify anything.? looked at more
closely to try to identify what was going wrong with his branch. He was having a

POL00071231

POL00071231

lot of losses over the past three weeks and thought that there was a system fault
with his remittances.

It appears that Adele Kilcoyne of NBSC requested this information from Fujitsu so that
the postmaster could study his archives to try to identify what had gone wrong. -
Regarding this last sentence - The call states that we passed the request to Adele
Kilcoyne but I do not know if Adele made the request to Fujitsu or not. A lot of
requests of this nature are turned down because of the cost to the business.

53. 30 January 2004, call reference H13011960 the sub-postmaster called in
relation to automated payments: the customer's account had not apparently been
credited with payment. An answer was provided to the sub-postmaster from the
knowledge base.

54. 30 January 2004, call reference Q13009942 Mrs Catherine Oglesby, the
Retail Line Manager reported that the sub-postmaster had authorised losses of
£6,754.09 for week 44. Apparently he could not identify what had caused the
loss and was unable to make good. The sub-postmaster also stated that he had
made good a loss of £1,100 in week 42. Mrs Oglesby asked NBSC to contact the
branch to try resolve his query. The sub-postmaster had applied for a hardship
form (which is what they do when they do not have the means to make good
unauthorised shortfalls). He was waiting for a return of an I&E form.

55. 30 January 2004, the customer’s account had not been credited with the
payment. NBSC provided an answer from the knowledge base.

56. 2 February 2004, The branch called to say that they had message on their
computer which stated that desk top initialisation had failed and that an
operational violation had been detected. This was passed to HSH.

57. 3 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called to query whether nominations are
being taken for pre-pay mobile phone vouchers. NBSC gave an answer from the
KB.

58. 3 February 2004, the branch asked for a telephone number for Girobank.
59, 3 February 2004, the branch called and asked for the telephone number for
Hanco. Hanco is the name of a company that supply some ATM machines in the

post office branch.

60. 4 February 2004, the branch called and asked for the procedure for producing
an overnight cash holding (ONCH) report.

6 February 2004, this is a card account query. The PID (this stands for personal
invitation document) had the wrong customers address on. The branch would
probably have been asking what they should do in this situation.

9 February 2004, the branch called because a customer wished to transfer
£3,000 from her ordinary account to open an investments account. The clerk
wanted to know which form was used to process this and whether they could
process it. An answer was supplied from the knowledge base.

10 February 2004, the branch called and asked how to rem out coin. The
branch does a remmitance on the computer to record stock or cash coming into
the office or leaving the branch. It is not often that a branch would have excess
coin and would need to rem this out, so that is probably why they asked for the
procedure on how to rem coin out.

11 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called who had a customer who has a
disabled son and is an appointee at the moment and had been told that she could
not be an appointee for her son. This is a query regarding Post Office Card
Account. If someone is unable to operate the account (possibly if they have a
disability) then they must have an appointee to operate the account on their
behalf. An answer was supplied from the knowledge base.

12 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and wanted to know the
procedure for opening a card account. The call log refers to COM7. COM stands
for Counter Operations Manual. These manuals list all Post Office transactions and
accounting procedures (there are 5 volumes and all office have these). The
knowledge base is linked into the COM’s to give answers. COM7 this means that
the answer was given from the Counter Operations Manual number 7.

12 February 2004, the branch reported an unauthorised loss of £8,243.10 in
week 46. There was an accumulated loss over the last four weeks. The branch
had applied for a hardship form. An amount was entered into the suspense
account pending completion of the hardship papers.

13 February 2004, the branch called and asked how to pay out on a capital
bank Lloyds TSB Bank cheque made out to Post Office Limited. The sub-
postmaster was advised that he should not pay out cash for this cheque. It
should only be used to pay for products or services.

13 February 2004, It is unclear who generated this call. The log recalls that
there was a loss of £8,243.10 in week 46 accumulated over the last four weeks.

Who NBSC or the spmr - It would be the suspense account team who
chased this form, they deal with hardship? chased an 1&E form (the form
used to apply for hardship) on 27 February 2004. There was a further loss of
£3,509.68 in week 48. This was added to the suspense account and the total loss
was now £11,752.78. Mrs Oglesby was aware of this and was visiting to assist
the sub-postmaster in completing the form. NBSC spoke to Mrs Oglesby on 25
March. The sub-postmaster had been suspended and the loss transferred to the
late account.

13 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and wanted to arrange a system
check due to small faults he had encountered with the system. He was referred
to HSH.

16 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and reported that the card could
not be read by the system and wanted to know what to do. He was given an

answer from the knowledge base.

16 February 2004, the branch called and stated that the system was unavailable
and wanted to know whether they could do a withdrawal. They were given an
answer from the knowledge base. If the customer wanted to withdraw from a Post
Office Card Account then a payments of up to £20 can be made in an emergency
if the system is not available. If it is a different kind if on line transaction then the
customer would be asked to go somewhere else of come back later.

16 February 2004, this call simply states Horizon KB0628. I believe (but am
not completely sure) that this means that there was a Horizon issue and the
subpostmaster was referred to HSH. The number KB0628 in the resolution could
be referring to the number of the answer from the Knowledge base.

16 February 2004, the sub-postmaster wanted to speak to HSH because his
screen was frozen. He was given an answer from the knowledge base.

19 February 2004, the branch called and wanted to know what the telephone
numbers were for transaction processing. They were given an answer from the

knowledge base.

21 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and asked how to deal with the
death of the card holder and was given an answer from the knowledge base.

24 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called asking for Mrs Oglesby to call him
regarding the previous conversation about the ongoing system problem. NBSC
advised Mrs Oglesby that the sub-postmaster had called.

77. 25 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called to state that he had been having
problems with the system and balance for about six weeks. The sub-postmaster
wanted to know whether they have started or completed a system check. Sandra
at NBSC spoke to HSH team leader who advised that they were now looking into
this for the sub-postmaster. NBSC called the clerk on Tuesday and she confirmed
that HSH had been in touch. She was given a call reference and asked to call
back if she had any further problems.

78. 25 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and wanted to speak to HSH
regarding system problems. He was transferred to HSH.

79. 26 February 2004, the branch reported a discrepancy and wanted a call from
service support reference H13071268 because there was a £3,509.68 shortage
and they wanted to use the suspense account. The sub-postmaster was advised
that the suspense account team would not deal with this until the sub-postmaster
“been to the correct cap” i.e. had actually rolled over and committed the
discrepancy. NBSC advised that HSH was still investigating the problem.

80. 26 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and stated that he was entering
into a smart post item on the system and it was an airsure going to the USA with
the value of £300. The sub-postmaster put the value into the system but the
price did not increase and wanted to know why. NBCS discussed with the sub-
postmaster and went through the procedure with him. It transpired that the sub-
postmaster was erroneously entering the high value at the start of the
transaction, so it set the price at the high value compensation rate.

81. 26 February 2004, the sub-postmaster reported £3,509.68 unauthorised losses
for week 48. He said that he had an ongoing problem which HSH were
investigating. The sub-postmaster was completing an I&E form to start the
hardship process for previous discrepancies. Accordingly, although the losses
were unauthorised, they were entered into the suspense account pending the

hardship process.

82. 3 March 2004, the branch reported that a customer had called and asked for a
change of name on the CAPO card (Card Account at Post Office) since it had the
wrong names. The branch was given an answer from the knowledge base.

83. 4 March 2004, Mrs Oglesby reported that she had called HSH as a branch was
constantly showing losses every week and the sub-postmaster thought this may
be down to software as the amount was getting worse each week. HSH had put
her straight through to NBSC without checking any incidents. This is when Sarah

8 March 2004, the branch was asking about a cash declaration on the system as
he had £7,579. The sub-postmaster was going to send through snapshots from
Saturday today.

8 March 2004, the branch called and asked what to do with impounded
Department of Works and Pensions (DWP) allowance dockets. The sub-
postmaster was advised that DWP makes the policy, not the Post Office.

that the branch would be open tomorrow at 9am.

98. 23 March 2004, the auditor wanted to speak to HSH to confirm that the sub-
postmaster had a new base unit fitted. The auditor was transferred to HSH.

99. 24 March 2004, it appears that the subpostmaster called to ask how to declare
his Bureau De Change (foreign currency). The select edit F10 is the procedure to
follow when declaring the bureau in the balance screen. I can only assume the
Hung Up means the SPMR hung up.

100.30 March 2004, NBSC spoke to the new, relief sub-postmaster, Ruth Simpson.
They took NS & I details and would pass to the customer when and if they came
in.

101.31 March 2004, the branch called and asked for what the concession number
was for a disabled rod licence. They were given an answer from the knowledge

base.

102.1 April 2004, the branch called and asked how to correct errors, this was relating
to revaluation. Revaluation happens when the price of postage goes up or down
and certain activities have to be undertaken on the Horizon system. They were

given an answer from the knowledge base.

103.4 April 2004, the new sub-postmaster stated that she could not balance a roll
over as the system was stating that she had negative/re-valued stock figures.
She was advised to complete the re-valuation during Cash Account period week 1
(CAPO1). This would then permit the system to allow her to roll over into week
02.

104.2 April 2004, the branch had received ocean liners stamps with the incorrect
price. The sub-postmaster was told to rem in and contact Hemmel Hempstead to
notify them. Hemmel Hempstead is the National Secure Stock Centre where all

stock and cash is sent from and to.

105.13 April 2004, the branch called and wanted an office address. They could have
been asking for another post office address or they could be asking for the
address of Transaction Processing at Chesterfield or other business owned
locations.

106.15 April 2004, the office wished to contact their retail line manager. The call was
passed to the admin team and a message was left for the retail Line Manager to
contact the office.

107.19 April 2004, the branch called and asked for the telephone number of National
Savings and was given an answer from the knowledge base.

108.19 Aprii 2004, the branch called and asked for a telephone number of
Transaction Processing and was given an answer from the knowledge base.

109.20 April 2004, the sub-postmaster called and wanted to speak to the retail line
manager regarding a problem that she is already dealing with. This call is a Page
RLM (Retail Line Manager) call. These calls are passed to the Admiistrative team
to contact the RLM. In the resolution it says “RLM Cath Oglesby Left Message on
Voicemail @ 14.28.” This means the administrative team left a message on

Catherine Oglesby’s voicemail at 2.28pm that day.

110,21 April 2004, the branch called to report a change in the opening hours and the
details were logged.

111.22 April 2004, the branch called and asked the retail line manager to contact the
branch regarding a problem that they were all dealing with. The message was
passed on by NBSC to Mrs Oglesby.

112.22 April 2004, Mr Castleton’s father-in-law called and stated that his son-in-law
and daughter had been suspended and somebody else had been put in and was
losing business. He wanted to speak to somebody more senior to Mrs Oglesby.
His message was passed to the area office for Head of Area (HOA) i.e. Mrs
Oglesby’s Line Manager to get in touch with Mr Franks.

113.22 April 2004, a call was taken from the sub-postmaster’s father-in-law and he
was given an answer from the knowledge base.

114.23 April 2004, Mr Castleton wanted to know if there was any way of printing out
all the calls he had made to NBSC and for them to be sent to him. He was
advised that if he wanted information regarding calls made to NBSC, he should
make his request in writing to Adele Kilcoyne of NBSC.

WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANDREW WISE

WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

I am currently a Training Manager employed by Post Office Limited (the Post
Office). I have worked for the Post Office since 1991. I am responsible for
training new sub-postmasters and branch counter staff on Post Office
Transactions and procedures and the Horizon system and co-ordinating national
training issues. From May 2001 to November 2004, I was a postal officer at the
Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) working as a Tier 2 Advisor. However
due to my experience and knowledge, I was often asked to stand in as a team
leader. My responsibilities included those of a service support advisor involved in
answering calls which were generally more complex then the first tier of calls that
sub-postmasters make to the NBSC. Prior to that, I was a Horizon field support
officer from 1999 to 2001 and prior to that I spent 8 years as a counter clerk. I
have a working knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a
computerised accounting system used by the Post Office.

I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless
otherwise stated. References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to
page numbers of Exhibit “AW1” to this Witness Statement.

Network Business Support Centre (NBSC)

The Post Office provides a service to sub-postmasters and clerks called the NBSC,
which is a helpline they can call to try to resolve business related queries.

There are two tiers of service support at NBSC. Tier one is essentially customer
services and is a separate entity. Tier two was run by the Post Office and was for
calls that tier one were unable to deal with. I understand that the tier one team
could between them take approximately 2,000 calls in total each day and at tier
two, an individual could take approximately 30 calls each day. Basically a sub-
postmaster would call the NBSC telephone number, select the options to get
through to tier one and then explain their problem. It may be a pre-recorded
standard response, but if there is none available, the sub-postmaster could get
put through to tier two. A lot of time on tier two is spent prompting sub-
postmasters and clerks to double check information they should have been

checking any way.

Double entry accounting and daily reporting procedures

5.

I have been asked to explain what Horizon is and the daily and weekly reporting
procedures that sub-postmasters must adhere to.

The counter positions in the post office branches each have a computer terminal,
this includes the processor, a touch sensitive screen, a keyboard, barcode scanner
and printer. Once a clerk logs on, any transactions they perform are recorded
and entered into the computer. The computer system is called Horizon.

Post Office branches operate double entry accounting. Almost every transaction
recorded by the clerk on to their computer has a corresponding physical
document, such as a TV license counter foil, savings bank deposit, withdrawal slip

or cheque.

A summary of the prescribed daily procedures that sub-postmasters must follow is
at pages 1 to 2. This includes the following:

1A_1209519_2 2
POL00071231
POL00071231

9. Each day the sub-postmaster must enter details on the green daily summary form
P5744 which is retained at the branch. They have to print a daily report and
check that the totals of the counter foils agree with that report. The report is
produced from information contained upon the Horizon system and shows all the
transactions of that type that have been recorded for the day. If the report and
the counter foils tally with each other, the subpostmaster cuts off the report on
the computer to reset it to zero for the next day. (‘Cut off’ means that the
subpostmaster presses a button on the computer to confirm that he has
completed the report, so that when the report is next printed, it will include only
transactions done after the cut-off point). They then complete a batch control
voucher (BCV) paperclip together none barcoded TV and non barcoded over 75
counter foils to the BCV and send the counter foils off to be processed. Up until a
few years ago, they sent them to Data Central, a processing centre in London run
by the Post Office. However, I am advised that from around February 2004
onwards there was a phased migration over to the EDS Processing Centre (EDS)
in Shepshed, Leicestershire because the task of processing was outsourced by the
Post Office to the EDS. From a branch point of view, this just meant putting the
BCV and Counterfoils in a different envelope.

Pe niki

10. The sub-postmaster has to print a report each day and check that the totals on
the print out agree with the documents to hand (whether cash deposit, cheque
deposit envelope or encashment cheques) if the totals agree, they then have to
cut off the report so that it resets for the next day. They then complete a BCV and
paperclip the cash deposit slips, check deposit envelopes and then encashed
cheques together and place in the envelope to go off to be processed.

Cheques, Giro bank deposits and Savings Bank

11. The sub-postmaster then goes through a similar daily procedure for cheques, giro
bank deposits and withdrawals, daily cash declaration and Savings Bank Deposits
and Withdrawals i.e. for each of these, the sub-postmaster has to print a report,
check that the cheques, giro slips, cash or other documents agree with the report,
paperclip the relevant documents together with the BCV and send them to the
correct place such as girobank, Data Central or (nowadays) EDS.

Weekly Balance Procedure

4A_1209519_2 3
POL00071231

POL00071231

12. Each week the sub-postmaster has to go through a weekly balancing procedure.
A summary of the current procedure is at pages 3 to 6. (The current procedure
refers to “Branch Trading” and “monthly Trading Statements”, which is a monthly
balancing process introduced in September 2005 to replace the weekly
procedure). Most of the balancing processes are still the same today but I have
tried to describe below the procedure as it was at the material time i.e. from
December 2003 to March 2004.

13. When the subpostmasters print their counter reports each day in time for the last
despatch from the branch (which could be as early as 4.00pm), they may in
practice then serve further customers and carry out further transactions that day.
Accordingly, when they do their weekly balance the subpostmaster has to
complete further copies of the counter daily reports (of the sort listed in
paragraphs 9 to 11 above) and counter weekly reports. All transactions that are
sent off weekly are classed as counter weekly reports. These include things such
as Pensions and Allowances, Green Giros, Postal Orders. These are listed on the
Weekly Balancing hand out. The reports look the same as those produced for
Daily reports. They are then are encouraged to print a balance snapshot and use
that to ensure that the Horizon system stock held figures matches the actual
stock holdings in their branch. They also have to check all receipt and payment
transaction totals with the supporting vouchers/documentation. There are ways
in which they can amend any stock discrepancies. They then have to print the
mandatory office weekly reports being the suspense account report and rejected
postage label report. These are produced off the A4 printer and retained in the

branch with the cash account.

14. The sub-postmaster then completes all other manual summaries and
reconciliations, for example National Savings Weekly Summary, Change Given
Return, Electric Tokens, Promotional/Payment Vouchers, MVL Weekly
Reconciliation, Rod Licence Reconciliation, Gift Voucher Weekly Reconciliation,
DVLA Premium Service Summaries, UK PA Check and Send summaries, Electric
Schemes and National Lottery Cheque Prize Payments.

15. If a branch has an On Demand Bureau de Change, the sub-postmaster then prints
a foreign currency report and checks the figures against their actual stock
holdings.

16. They then make new declarations for cash and stamps, entering on the system

the cash nominations they have and a number of each different type of stamps.
They then print a report which is kept with their branch.

1A_1209519_2 4
POL00071231
POL00071231

17. The office then produces a Trial Balance report, if all the cash stock and figures
are correct and once the National Lottery figures have been entered the office can
then be rolled over and a Final Balance report is produced.

18. Each week, the sub-postmaster sends to Chesterfield the paid postal and money
orders slips, a Giro Bank Change Summary (the Post Office offers a change giving
service to customers that bank with Girobank and this is a summary of how many
transactions are done), UKPA Check and Send (if they do the Passport Check and
Send service, which would be unlikely in a sub post office), a form setting out
Redeemed Post Office and TV Savings Stamps, National Lottery prize payments
(£500 plus) (which shows details of what cheques have been issued to National
Lottery winners where the prize is more than £500) and DVLA premium service
forms (which is a service where a customer can apply for a photo card driving
licence at the Post office. The branch checks the form and ID and sends it off.

19. After everything has been completed and the office is happy with the balance they
will then complete the weekly Cash Account report. 2 copies are produced and
signed. 1 of these copies is sent to Transaction Processing at Chesterfield and the

other is retained in the office.

The Horizon System

20. Accordingly, it can be seen that if the clerk or sub-postmaster makes a mistake
when imputing transaction details into their computer, there are a number of
points at which this can be picked up, because there are daily and weekly reports
that the sub-postmaster have to produce at which stage they have to check and
satisfy themselves that the documents for example, cheques, giros, pensions and
allowances match what they have entered on the system. In addition to that,
there are various teams responsible for different sorts of paperwork produced by
the branch, including a giro bank team, cheques team and pension team. For
example, if the clerk records an item incorrectly on the system, they should pick
this up on either their daily or weekly report. However if they fail to do so, this
will be picked up at the Processing Centre. If an item has been wrongly recorded,
an error notice would be generated, although this can easily take up to 12 weeks
or so. This will mean that if a transaction has been over or under stated there will
be either a claim or charge error respectively.

Sub-Postmaster Training

POL00071231

POL00071231

As previously stated, I am currently responsible for training new sub-postmasters
and branch counter staff on Horizon. The training includes how to use the Horizon
system and would include a lot of transaction based procedures such as ~ Cheque
acceptance, Girobank, National Savings, pensions and Allowances, Postage, TV
licences, letters and parcels and Personal banking. It also covers subjects like
customer care and security, Health and Safety, how to use the counter operation
manuals and procedures such as the daily accounting and (at the time in
question) weekly balancing.

In the training delivery team we have a record of Mr Castleton becoming
subpostmaster on 18 July 2003 and that he was offered 4 days training from the
14 to 17 July at our classroom in Leeds. Mr Castleton then had a trainer on site
with him from 18 to 25 July 2004.

Each branch has a copy of the Horizon User Guide which is a reference tool and
explains how to use Horizon, (such as balancing, administration, reports, transfers
remittances and transactions) and a Horizons Operations Manual which gives
guidance on products such as girobank, national savings accounts, personal
banking, corporate banking, cash and cheques acceptance, pensions and counter
operations. In addition, literature such as Operation Focus a weekly magazine
circulated to all branches and operational Workaid, a similar magazine but
circulated as and when there are more major changes to products, prices or
procedures, help keep branches abreast of developments.

NBSC Review

24.

My understanding was that on or around 4 March 2004 Mrs Oglesby asked NBSC
for information relating to Marine Drive branch. The information requested was
regarding calls made to the NBSC from the Marine Drive branch relating to losses
when balancing and what investigations were undertaken by NBSC during these
calls. Sarah Pennington (who has since left the Post Office) was the Tier 2 advisor
who dealt with some of the calls raised by this office at the time and during these
calls she discussed the issues with me. She then reported to Andrew Price
(NBSC) who in turn reported back to Mrs Oglesby on 20 April 2004 (page 13).
The e-mail states that Sarah Pennington spoke to the sub-postmaster at Marine
Drive who wasn’t sure what was causing the errors and that he had been using
the slave computer terminal to enter his stock and cash, which he was told would
not cause a problem as long as it was attached to the correct stock unit. If there
was any communication problem between the two computers, the words “node
disconnected” would flash up on screen when any reports were produced.

POL00071231

POL00071231

The sub-postmaster apparently thought there were some errors relating to the
National Lottery. I understand from the e-mail that Sarah phoned the lottery
team at transaction processing who confirmed that there were some errors, but
for every charge error there was a corresponding claim error as the clerk and/or
sub-postmaster had entered the lottery figures in the wrong cash account period.
If the cash account period (week number) is wrong one week, the next week this
would balance out, hence the sub-postmaster would receive a charge error in the
first week and a claim error in the second week.

Sarah’s e-mail records that the sub-postmaster was also concerned that when
entering the lottery figures, the terminals did not appear to be communicating.
However if that had been the case, the sub-postmaster would have a very large
number of errors on every report and product.

I looked at the cash account information that the sub-postmaster sent to me but
was unable to find any errors. The only amount questioned was a large amount
on the cheques to Processing Centre, but I was able to confirm that this was a
cheque payment for the purchase of the premium bonds. Accordingly, there is
nothing more NBSC could do and we suggested he work a manual system at the
side of Horizon to see if any problems were highlighted. He was also advised to
take a snapshot before and after he did the REMs to see if there were any
problems occurring when he did a remittance.

When a subpostmaster receives a delivery of cash and/or stock, he enters the
details and quantity into his computer and this is called “remming in” the stock).
The cash and stock are delivered to the office in a grey pouch by the Cash in
Transit driver. The subpostmaster would sign a docket to say that they have
received this pouch (each pouch had a reference number and this tied up with
what the cash centre had put in the pouch, so the driver never knew what was in
each pouch). The subpostmaster would then open the pouch and there would be
an advice note in the pouch listing what cash or stock should be in that pouch.
The subpostmaster had 24 hours to check that the amount agreed with the advice
note (if it did not he had to contact the Rem Unit within 24 hours of receiving the
pouch). The subpostmaster would then rem this amount into the Horizon system
and it produced a rem in slip that was attached to the advice note and was
retained in the branch with all other paper work. (This procedure changed around
August 2004 to an automated system where the barcodes on the pouches were
scanned in on Horizon and the value was automatically entered on the system).

We concluded that the Horizon system was working properly and did not appear
to be the cause of the unauthorised losses incurred.

NBSC Call Logs

30. I have been asked to provide an overview of the call logs from the Marine Drive
branch and an overview of them from December 2003 to April 2004 are set out
below - FAD code 213337. These were compiled during the ordinary course of
business from information supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be
supposed to have personal knowledge of the matter dealt with in the information
supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the information or cannot be
traced. I probably dealt with very few of these calls (if any at all) and the
accordingly the information set out below questions is based on my interpretation
(from experience) of what is written in the call logs and is provided simply to help
clarify them for the benefit of the Court.

31. 1 December 2003, call reference H12881564 the sub-postmaster wanted to
know where they sent their application for telephone claims. The resolution was
stated to be KB which means that an answer was provided from the knowledge
base. Given the volume and variety of calls to NBSC, the KB is a tool used by
NBSC to find information and give answers to subpostmasters. It as a bit like a
computerised library for the P.O or a more tailored and sophisticated version of
“Frequently Asked Questions” that you often see on websites and enables NBSC to
effectively apply and maintain consistent service standards across the board when
dealing with subpostmaster queries. The NBSC advisor will use a system called
“Remedy” (which is the system used to log calls and is linked to the KB) to
categorise a call made by a subpostmaster. If the correct categorisation is used,
then the system should give the advisor the answer to the question. This is
because when NBSC search on the knowledge base, there is taxonomy or “case
titles” to help choose answers from and they select which one you want to see.
The answer is displayed in a Microsoft Word document. For example, the case title
for the above question could be “What are the Contact Details for Telephone

Claims.”

32. 1 December 2003, call reference H12881573 the caller wanted a telephone
number for human resources. An answer was given from the knowledge base.

33. 11 December 2003, call reference Hi2903595 there was a power failure on
the street and the office has electronic shutters so the branch was unable to open.
Each branch has 2 or 3 nominated offices so if an office is closed the customers
will be directed to a nominated office to transact their business. NBSC would give
the nominated office details to the subpostmaster so he could display a notice
telling customers where to go.

POL00071231

POL00071231

34, 11 December 2003, call reference H12904136 the clerk called to confirm that
the branch had been reopened.

35. 12 December 2003, cali reference Hi2906756 the clerk wanted to know
what the counter procedure was for a local collect when a customer comes to pick
it up. Local collect is a service offered by the post office: if Royal Mail can not
deliver a package, they can leave this at the local Post Office branch and the
customer can collect it from there. They were provided with an answer from the
knowledge base.

36. 13 December 2003, call reference H12908771 this was a call because the
customer had received a card in the name of Vera instead of Violet. This was
resolved by providing the clerk with an answer from the knowledge base.

37. 13 December 2003, call reference H12908772 the office was open but was
showing up as closed. This call would have been created by the advisor who
answered the previous call. When they took the first call, it would have flagged up
on the computer that the office was still closed where in fact it was open. This call
would have been passed to the administration team and they would change the
office status to open.

38. 22 December 2003, call reference H12925312 the postmaster sent off an
application with the Personal Invitation Document (PID), which is used to apply
for a Post Office Card Account Card for the opening of an account and
identification form which was erroneously rejected by the EDS. They retained the
ID form and PID and the application form was represented, but it had been
returned again because there was no PID or ID form, although the sub-
postmaster said that EDS had retained them. The caller advised the sub-
postmaster that as the application had been erroneously rejected, NBSC would
pass his comments to our customer relations team to progress as a complaint
against EDS.

39, 22 December 2003, call reference H12925361 this is a record of the sub-
postmaster’s complaint about EDS being forwarded to them.

40. 23 December 2003, call reference H21243010 the postmaster wanted to
know if the procedures for printing a postage label had changed and was advised
that the pre-paid will be reduced by an amount of extra service (recorded).

41. 30 December 2003, call reference H12937387 the clerk called to say that the

customer had changed addresses and also post offices for his card (which I
believe would have been his Post Office Card Account). His new card had been

sent to the old office and the clerk wanted to know how he could have had the
card directed to the new office. This was resolved by providing the clerk with
information from the knowledge base.

30 December 2003, call reference H12937703 the sub-postmaster had
received a few enquiries from customers regarding the changes to the National
Savings Ordinary Account. The sub-postmaster was advised that NBSC do not
have any further information regarding the changes to the Ordinary Saving
Account other than information contained in MBS 453. MBS stands for “Message
Broadcast System”. When urgent information needs to be sent the network a MBS
is sent out direct to all Post Office branches to their Horizon system. MBS 453 is
the number of the MBS sent out. I do not have a copy of this and doubt whether
they would be kept from 3 years ago, but in any event it would only hold
information relating to National savings Ordinary Account.

14 January 2004, call reference H12971100 the clerk called in relation to a
discrepancy i.e. a loss of £1,103.13. They were provided with an answer from the
knowledge base. The call log does not record what the subpostmaster said.
From memory, I believe that the advice on the KB for an office that misbalanced
was that the subpostmaster should to check all cash stamps and stock, check
rems and cheques to processing centre rems, and check pensions and allowances
and other documentation.

19 January 2004, call reference Q12980113 there was an incorrect cash
dispatch. It appears from the call log that Lisa, the person calling from the
branch, was not sure of the procedure to despatch cash to Hemel Hemstead (this
is the main cash depot), NBSC advised her of the correct procedure.

20 January 2004, call reference H21265950. This is a request to have a
copy of week 43/03 counter news to be sent to the office. Counter News is a
weekly publication sent to all branches that lists operational changes, it could be
the branch lost or did not receive a copy.

20 January 2004, call reference H21265965 the sub-postmaster had not
received a copy of the sales report for the last period and wanted to know how
one could be ordered. The sub-postmaster was advised that the reports were late
and he should receive it by the end of the week at the latest as they were being
dispatched.

21 January 2004, call reference H12987381 the sub-postmaster called
because they had a cash account discrepancy of £4,294.67. The call was logged
with the suspense team. (At this time, there was a suspense team to try to

ensure that nothing was transferred into the suspense account that was not
permitted).

22 January 2004, call reference H12987919 the sub-postmaster reported a
loss of £4,000. He said he was in the office until 1ipm last night but could not
find anything. The NBSC went through all the balanced cheques with him. It
appeared that the sub-postmaster had checked the REMs in and out, his cash,
stock and pensions and allowances but was unable to find the loss. The sub-
postmaster was therefore advised that this matter would be passed through to
the suspense team. (When cash or stock goes into a branch, it is “remmed” in ie
entered into or out of the system. The sub-postmaster has to check the rem foils
to verify that he receives the cash or stock listed on the foil).

22 January 2004, cali reference H12987957 the sub-postmaster called.
There was a loss in week 43 of £4,230.97. This was an unknown error. That
means that the sub-postmaster should not transfer the loss into the suspense

account.

22 January 2004, call reference H21268317 a disabled customer's card had
arrived in an incorrect name of Bernice instead of Denise and the sub-postmaster
wanted to speak to EDS. An answer was given from the knowledge base.

27 January 2004, call reference H12999552 this refers to a training event in
Scarborough.

28 January 2004, call reference H13003838 the sub-postmaster enquired
whether there was a service available for customers to send money to somebody
in another part of the country. That answer was provided from the knowledge
base.

28 January 2004, call reference H21272735 the sub-postmaster had called to
say that since he had broadband installed, every time he receives stock into his
office it was showing short by the same amount. He had checked to make sure
that it was remmed in properly but it was still showing £2,500 short. After NBSC
spoke to the sub-postmaster, it appeared that he was entering all the transactions
correctly, so the sub-postmaster was advised that if he felt that that was a
technical system problem he should call the Horizon System Helpline (HSH) that
deals with technical issues, so that they could investigate. The NBSC advisor
would have gone through the rem procedure with the subpostmaster and it looks
like he established he was remming the cash in correctly. He was advised to
“balance and roll for a definite figure” i.e. to produce a trial balance, since it is

1A_1209519_2 i
POL00071231

POL00071231

only at this stage you can get an accurate picture of what the value of the
discrepancy is and to call HSH if he didn’t have any success.

54. 29 January 2004, call reference H13005452 the branch called and said they
were showing a loss of £2,523.12 and that this was the third discrepancy in as
many weeks. NBSC checked through the figures using a transaction log and also
looked at the REMs declaration and the cash flow. No trace of the discrepancy was
found and this was referred to the suspense account team to review.

55. 29 January 2004, cali reference H13005643 a call was created by NBSC and
assigned to the Suspense Account team to deal with. The call notified the
suspense Account Team that the branch had an unauthorised or unidentified loss
of £6,754.09. The Suspense Account Team would then contact the office to
determine if it was an unidentified loss and they would decide if the sub-

postmaster is authorised to hold the loss or not.

56. 29 January 2004, call reference H21274188 the sub-postmaster wanted to
have his transactional archives (presumably to try to identify what was going
wrong at his branch). Horizon only holds about 30 days worth of data and after
this period all the transaction data is archived by Fujitsu. The Post Office can
request office archived data from Fujitsu. He was having a lot of losses over the
past three weeks and thought that there was a system fault with his remittances.
It appears that the subpostmaster’s request was passed on to Adele Kilcoyne of
NBSC.

57. 30 January 2004, call reference H13011960 the sub-postmaster called in
relation to automated payments: the customer’s account had not apparently been
credited with payment. An answer was provided to the sub-postmaster from the

knowledge base.

58. 30 January 2004, call reference Q13009942 Mrs Catherine Oglesby, the
Retail Line Manager reported that the sub-postmaster had authorised losses of
£6,754.09 for week 44. Apparently he could not identify what had caused the
loss and was unable to make good. The sub-postmaster had stated that he had
made good a loss of £1,100 in week 42. Mrs Oglesby asked NBSC to contact the
branch to try resolve his query. The sub-postmaster had applied for a hardship
form (which is what they do when they do not have the means to make good
unauthorised shortfalls). He was waiting for a return of an I&E form.

59. 30 January 2004, the customer’s account had not been credited with the
payment. NBSC provided an answer from the knowledge base.

2 February 2004, The branch called to say that they had message on their
computer which stated that desk top initialisation had failed and that an
operational violation had been detected. This was passed to HSH.

3 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called to query whether nominations are
being taken for pre-pay mobile phone vouchers. NBSC gave an answer from the
KB.

3 February 2004, the branch asked for a telephone number for Girobank.

3 February 2004, the branch called and asked for the telephone number for
Hanco. Hanco is the name of a company that supply some ATM machines in the
post office branch.

4 February 2004, the branch called and asked for the procedure for producing
an overnight cash holding (ONCH) report.

6 February 2004, this is a card account query. The PID (this stands for personal
invitation document) had the wrong customers address on. The branch would
probably have been asking what they should do in this situation.

9 February 2004, the branch called because a customer wished to transfer
£3,000 from her ordinary account to open an investments account. The clerk
wanted to know which form was used to process this and whether they could
process it. An answer was supplied from the knowledge base.

10 February 2004, the branch called and asked how to rem out coin. The
branch does a remmitance on the computer to record stock or cash coming into
the office or leaving the branch. It is not often that a branch would have excess
coin and would need to rem this out, so that is probably why they asked for the

procedure on how to rem coin out.

41 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called who had a customer who has a
disabled son and is an appointee at the moment and had been told that she could
not be an appointee for her son. This is a query regarding Post Office Card
Account. If someone is unable to operate the account (possibly if they have a
disability) then they must have an appointee to operate the account on their
behalf. An answer was supplied from the knowledge base.

12 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and wanted to know the
procedure for opening a card account. The call log refers to COM7. COM stands
for Counter Operations Manual. These manuals list all Post Office transactions and

accounting procedures (there are 5 volumes and all office have these). The
knowledge base is linked into the COM’s to give answers. COM7 this means that
the answer was given from the Counter Operations Manual number 7.

12 February 2004, the branch reported an unauthorised loss of £8,243.10 in
week 46, There was an accumulated loss over the last four weeks. The branch
had applied for a hardship form. An amount was entered into the suspense
account pending completion of the hardship papers.

13 February 2004, the branch called and asked how to pay out on a capital
bank Lloyds TSB Bank cheque made out to Post Office Limited. The sub-
postmaster was advised that he should not pay out cash for this cheque. It
should only be used to pay for products or services.

13 February 2004, It is unclear who generated this call. The log recalls that
there was a loss of £8,243.10 in week 46 accumulated over the last four weeks.
The Suspense Account team may have chased the subpostmaster for an I&E form
(the form used to apply for hardship) on 27 February 2004. There was a further
loss of £3,509.68 in week 48. This was added to the suspense account and the
total loss was now £11,752.78. Mrs Oglesby was aware of this and was visiting to
assist the sub-postmaster in completing the form. NBSC spoke to Mrs Oglesby on
25 March. The sub-postmaster had been suspended and the loss transferred to
the late account.

13 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and wanted to arrange a system
check due to small faults he had encountered with the system. He was referred
to HSH.

16 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and reported that the card could
not be read by the system and wanted to know what to do. He was given an
answer from the knowledge base.

16 February 2004, the branch called and stated that the system was unavailable
and wanted to know whether they could do a withdrawal. They were given an
answer from the knowledge base. If the customer wanted to withdraw from a Post
Office Card Account then a payments of up to £20 can be made in an emergency
if the system is not available. If it is a different kind if on line transaction then the
customer would be asked to go somewhere else of come back later.

16 February 2004, this call simply states Horizon KB0628. I believe (but am
not completely sure) that this means that there was a Horizon issue and the

subpostmaster was referred to HSH. The number KB0628 in the resolution could
be referring to the number of the answer from the Knowledge base.

16 February 2004, the sub-postmaster wanted to speak to HSH because his
screen was frozen. He was given an answer from the knowledge base.

19 February 2004, the branch called and wanted to know what the telephone
numbers were for transaction processing. They were given an answer from the
knowledge base.

21 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and asked how to deal with the
death of the card holder and was given an answer from the knowledge base.

24 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called asking for Mrs Oglesby to call him
regarding the previous conversation about the ongoing system problem. NBSC
advised Mrs Oglesby that the sub-postmaster had called.

25 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called to state that he had been having
problems with the system and balance for about six weeks. The sub-postmaster
wanted to know whether they have started or completed a system check. Sandra
at NBSC spoke to HSH team leader who advised that they were now looking into
this for the sub-postmaster. NBSC called the clerk on Tuesday and she confirmed
that HSH had been in touch. She was given a call reference and asked to call
back if she had any further problems.

25 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and wanted to speak to HSH
regarding system problems. He was transferred to HSH.

26 February 2004, the branch reported a discrepancy and wanted a call from
service support reference H13071268 because there was a £3,509.68 shortage
and they wanted to use the suspense account. The sub-postmaster was advised
that the suspense account team would not deal with this until the sub-postmaster
“been to the correct cap” i.e. had actually rolled over and committed the
discrepancy. NBSC advised that HSH was still investigating the problem.

26 February 2004, the sub-postmaster called and stated that he was entering
into a smart post item on the system and it was an airsure going to the USA with
the value of £300. The sub-postmaster put the value into the system but the
price did not increase and wanted to know why. NBCS discussed with the sub-
postmaster and went through the procedure with him. It transpired that the sub-
postmaster was erroneously entering the high value at the start of the
transaction, so it set the price at the high value compensation rate.

26 February 2004, the sub-postmaster reported £3,509.68 unauthorised losses
for week 48. He said that he had an ongoing problem which HSH were
investigating. The sub-postmaster was completing an I&E form to start the
hardship process for previous discrepancies. Accordingly, although the losses
were unauthorised, they were entered into the suspense account pending the
hardship process.

3 March 2004, the branch reported that a customer had called and asked for a
change of name on the CAPO card (Card Account at Post Office) since it had the
wrong names. The branch was given an answer from the knowledge base.

4 March 2004, Mrs Oglesby reported that she had called HSH as a branch was
constantly showing losses every week and the sub-postmaster thought this may
be down to software as the amount was getting worse each week. HSH had put
her straight through to NBSC without checking any incidents. This is when Sarah
Pennington was asked to outline what investigations she had made (as set out in

paragraphs 20-24 above).

8 March 2004, the branch was asking about a cash declaration on the system as
he had £7,579. The sub-postmaster was going to send through snapshots from
Saturday today.

8 March 2004, the branch called and asked what to do with impounded
Department of Works and Pensions (DWP) allowance dockets. The sub-
postmaster was advised that DWP makes the policy, not the Post Office.

8 March 2004, the branch called and asked who the cheque should be made
payable to for premium bonds. An answer was given from the knowledge base.

9 March 2004, the branch called and asked what the process was for a buy back
pre-order accounting and dispatch. They were given an answer from the

knowledge base.

10 March 2004, the branch called and asked for the telephone number for
Chesterfield and were given the answer from the knowledge base.

15 March 2004, the branch called and stated that the balance on the card
account was less than what is in the account and wanted to know what to do.
They were given an answer from the knowledge base.

and were given an answer from the knowledge base.

95. 18 March 2004, the sub-postmaster called and wanted the branch details for
Post Office No. 225840. They were given an answer from the knowledge base.

96. 22 March 2004, the sub-postmaster wanted to know how to issue a vault card to
a customer. The advisor followed the procedure from the knowledge base.

97. 23 March 2004, the auditor called and wanted to know if the office had had a
new base unit. They were told to try calling HSH.

98. 23 March 2004, the auditor called and wanted to know if there were any losses
that had been authorised from about week 40. They were told that there are
three losses and all are unauthorised.

99. 23 March 2004, It appears that the subpostmaster forgot his password so could
not log on to Horizon and telephoned NBSC for a One Shot Password (OSP).

100.23 March 2004, the branch had to close and other nominated branches were
informed and told to serve customers from the Marine drive branch.

101.23 March 2004, the subpostmaster or a post office clerk called NBSC to confirm
that the branch would be open tomorrow at 9am.

102.23 March 2004, the auditor wanted to speak to HSH to confirm that the sub-
postmaster had a new base unit fitted. The auditor was transferred to HSH.

103.24 March 2004, it appears that the subpostmaster called to ask how to declare
his Bureau De Change (foreign currency). The select edit F10 is the procedure to
follow when declaring the bureau in the balance screen. I can only assume the
Hung Up means the SPMR hung up.

104.30 March 2004, NBSC spoke to the new, relief sub-postmaster, Ruth Simpson.
They took NS & I details and would pass to the customer when and if they came

in.

105.31 March 2004, the branch called and asked for what the concession number
was for a disabled rod licence. They were given an answer from the knowledge

base.

106.1 April 2004, the branch called and asked how to correct errors, this was relating
to revaluation. Revaluation happens when the price of postage goes up or down
and certain activities have to be undertaken on the Horizon system. They were
given an answer from the knowledge base.

107.1 April 2004, the new sub-postmaster stated that she could not balance a roll
over as the system was stating that she had negative/re-valued stock figures.
She was advised to complete the re-valuation during Cash Account period week 1
(CAPO1). This would then permit the system to allow her to roll over into week
02.

108.2 April 2004, the branch had received ocean liners stamps with the incorrect
price. The sub-postmaster was told to rem in and contact Hemmel Hempstead to
notify them. Hemmel Hempstead is the National Secure Stock Centre where all
stock and cash is sent from and to.

109.13 April 2004, the branch called and wanted an office address. They could have
been asking for another post office address or they could be asking for the
address of Transaction Processing at Chesterfield or other business owned

locations.

110.15 April 2004, the office wished to contact their retail line manager. The call was
passed to the admin team and a message was left for the retail Line Manager to
contact the office.

111.19 April 2004, the branch called and asked for the telephone number of National
Savings and was given an answer from the knowledge base.

112.19 April 2004, the branch called and asked for a telephone number of
Transaction Processing and was given an answer from the knowledge base.

113.20 April 2004, the sub-postmaster called and wanted to speak to the retail line
manager regarding a problem that she is already dealing with. This call is a Page
RLM (Retail Line Manager) call. These calls are passed to the Admiistrative team
to contact the RLM. In the resolution it says “RLM Cath Oglesby Left Message on
Voicemail @ 14.28.” This means the administrative team left a message on
Catherine Oglesby’s voicemail at 2.28pm that day.

114.24 April 2004, the branch called to report a change in the opening hours and the
details were logged.

22 April 2004, the branch called and asked the retail line manager to contact the
branch regarding a problem that they were all dealing with. The message was
passed on by NBSC to Mrs Oglesby.

.22 April 2004, Mr Castleton’s father-in-law called and stated that his son-in-law

and daughter had been suspended and somebody else had been put in and was
losing business. He wanted to speak to somebody more senior to Mrs Oglesby.
His message was passed to the area office for Head of Area (HOA) i.e. Mrs
Oglesby’s Line Manager to get in touch with Mr Franks.

.22 April 2004, a call was taken from the sub-postmaster’s father-in-law and he

was given an answer from the knowledge base.

23 April 2004, Mr Castleton wanted to know if there was any way of printing out
all the calls he had made to NBSC and for them to be sent to him. He was
advised that if he wanted information regarding calls made to NBSC, he should
make his request in writing to Adele Kilcoyne of NBSC.

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF CATHERINE OGLESBY

I, CATHERINE OGLESBY of |
ILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

1. Since April 2005, I have been a Sales Account Manager for the Post Office Limited
(the Post Office) with responsibility for ensuring that 24 directly managed post
office branches achieve their sales targets. Before that, I was a Retail Line
Manager (RLM) for approximately 8 years. As an RLM, I was responsible for
ensuring that sub postmasters in 85 sub post offices properly carried out their
duties to maintain service standards (for example, in relation to waiting times and
office appearance) and reach sales targets. I have worked for the Post office for
23 years.

2. I make this witness statement from facts within my own knowledge unless
otherwise stated. I have had the benefit of reading through my correspondence
and papers. References to page numbers in this witness statement are to page

numbers of Exhibit CO2 to this witness statement.

3. Ihave been asked to give a brief overview of the layout off

c (the Marine Drive branch) and describe how the business

works, for the benefit of the Court. At pages 1 to 3 are office copy entries which
show that Mr Lee Castleton and Mrs Lisa Marie Castleton have been the registered

C OGLESBY

POL00071231

proprietors of the freehold since 17 October 2003 and that they bought the
freehold on 18 July 2003. At page 4 is a rough plan I have drawn from memory
of the interior of the Marine Drive branch [Cath, please can you draw and send
to me a rough plan of the ground floor?]. The ground floor of the freehold
contains a rectangular shaped shop and from the entranceway, the Post Office
counter is in the far left hand corner of the shop. The shop counter and National
Lottery till are on the right as you enter the shop. [Are there living quarters
upstairs for Castleton]?

4. From 18 July 2003 to 23 March 2004 Mr Castleton was subpostmaster of the
Marine Drive branch. His contract for services was in the standard format used for
subpostmasters at the time and a copy of that contract together with the signed
page is at pages [ ] (the Contact).

5. Section 1, paragraph 3 of the Contract provides that the subpostmaster must
provide and maintain at his own expense, reasonable office accommodation
required by the Post Officer and pay, also at his own expense, any assistants he
may need to carry on post Office business. At the material time, Mr Castleton
retained Christine Train as his assistant who work behind the Post Office counter
and I believe that she had worked at the Marine Drive branch for many years.
[Do you remember whether anyone else worked behind the P.O counter
too? Mrs Castleton’s wife, Lisa-Marie, worked in the shop. {Do you remember
whether anyone else worked in the shop?]

6. There are 2 Post Office counter positions at the Marine Drive branch, each with its
own computer terminal, barcode scanner and printer. Before open of business
each day, the subpostmaster and any assistant logs on to their computer. They
must record all transactions they perform on their computer. They can record
transactions either by using their touch sensitive screen or keyboard. The
computer system in the branches is called Horizon. Horizon is in effect, a
sophisticated computerised calculator.

7. Almost every transaction recorded by the subpostmaster and his assistant on to
their computer has one or sometimes more corresponding physical documents.
For example, when a customer pays their TV license, the subpostmaster will
retain the TV licence counter foil. If that customer paid for their licence by
cheque, the subpostmaster will also have the cheque.

1A_1107486_3 2
[Do you feei comfortable saying this para?] At the end of each day, the
subpostmaster prints from their computer various reports, The procedure is
slightly different for different products, but broadly speaking, they then compare
these reports against the physical documents they have (such as cheques or
licence counterfoils) to ensure they match. They then send the reports and
accompanying documents off to be processed. When these are processed, if the
covering report printed out from the branch’s computer does not match the
accompanying physical documents, an error notice is generated. An error notice
is a correction statement. Its creation would help explain whether there was any
legitimate reason for an error having been made (for example, because
subpostmaster or his assistant made an incorrect entry into the computer when
recording a transaction).

At the material time, the subpostmaster also had to balance on a weekly basis
and produce a cash account. The cash account contained information such as
cash and stock in hand at the end of that week, receipts, payments, the balance
due to the Post Office and whether there were any discrepancies such as a surplus
or shortfall, The subpostmasters had to sign the cash account to certify that it is

accurate.

December 2003

10.

ii.

Between approximately Christmas 2003 and the New Year, I was contacted by
telephone by Mr Castleton who told me that on week 39 (the week ending 23
December 2003), he had been £1,100 short in his cash account. We discussed
what might be the usual explanation for this, for example the Giro Bank error or
cheque deposits going through as cash. I suggested that he contact Giro Bank and
National Savings to see if there were any problems. I also asked him to make
good the sum of £1,100, because a Giro Bank error notice may take up to 8 weeks
to arrive. Mr Castleton said that he could make the amount good and we left
things at that.

This had been the first time since Mr Castleton took over the Post Office in July
2003 that he had any major problems in balancing. Copies of the Cash Accounts
signed by Mr Castleton for the weeks ending 23 December 2003 (cash account
week 39), 30 December 2003 (cash account week 40), 7 January 2004 (cash

1A_1107486_3 3

POL00071231
POL00071231
account week 41) and 14 January 2004 (cash account week 42) are at pages 53 to
91.

Shortfalls in January 2004

12. In accordance with my normal visiting plan, I visited the Marine Drive Branch on
Friday 16 January 2004. At the time, no reason had come to light to explain the
loss of £1,100. The previous 3 weeks’ balances seemed to be fine.

13. On or around 21 January 2004 (cash account week 43) Mr Castleton contacted me
because his balance was over £4,000 short. A copy of the Cash Account he signed
for that week is at page 92. I again asked him to contact Giro Bank and National
Savings to see whether there were any problems. I also asked him whether the
cash was kept secure and who had access to it. Mr Castleton did not believe that
any of his staff could have taken the money. He stated that on this occasion, he
was unable to make good the shortfall. I advised him to contact the helpline to
get a hardship form. (A sub postmaster is contractually obliged to make good any
shortfalls without delay. However if a sub postmaster cannot immediately make
goods the shortfalls, he may complete and submit a hardship form setting out
details of his earnings and other relevant information to seek the Post Office’s
permission to make good the shortfalis by instalment payments rather than

immediately).

14. We also discussed at length ways for him to double check all of the paperwork
leaving the Marine Drive Branch (for example, the giro paying in slips, pension and
allowance dockets and certain types of cheques) and to perform a snapshot each
evening to check the cash. (Effectively, the balance snapshot is just a facility to
allow the sub postmaster to quickly check transactions through the week. It is a
report that contains what the computer believes should be the total cash in stock
figure, not what cash the branch actually does have. It looks at the previous
week’s declared cash in stock and adjusts items as they are sold, so if someone
forgets to enter an item that a customer has purchased, then the balance snapshot
figure will be inaccurate).

15.1 contacted Mr Castleton by telephone on or around 28 January 2004 (cash
account week 44). After he said he was a further £2,500 short, again, we had a
lengthy discussion to discuss all the daily workings. A copy of the Cash Account
for that week signed by Mr Castleton is at pages 102 to 111. I brought up in the

4A.1107486_3 4

POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231

conversation the possibility that somebody might be taking the cash, but Mr
lity. I suggested that he carry out individual
stock unit balancing. Small post offices such as the Marine Drive Branch which has

Castleton discounted that possi

2 cashier positions run a shared stock system: All the cash and stock is contained
on 1 balance sheet. However, with individual stock balancing, each computer has
its own separate stock and cash balance. Mr Castleton did not wish to do this, as
he felt that Marine Drive Branch did not lend itself to doing this sort of balancing.
I was surprised that Mr Castleton did not take up my suggestion because although
there is some work involved setting up individual stock balancing, it would have
enabled us to identify whether the losses were caused by any individua! cashier.

Shortfalis in February 2004

16. The next week ended 5 February 2005, (cash account week 45) the Marine Drive
Branch was only £25 short (pages 112 to 123) [Cath can you check this
because looking at the cash account, I think it was £25 over this week,
not short]. However, the week after ending 11 February 2004 (cash account
week 46) the Marine Drive Branch was £1,500 short (pages 124 to 135). By now,
after just 4 weeks, the Marine Drive Branch was a total of £8,243.10 short, not
counting the sum of £1,100 that Mr Castleton had made good to start with. I
visited the Marine Drive branch around this time and asked Mr Castleton whether
he had obtained a Hardship Form. He said that he hadn’t and I advised him to
obtain one. I understand that he did, and he placed the sum of £8,243.10 into the
suspense account. Sub postmasters are contractually obliged to make good all
losses without delay and Mr Castleton should not have been rolling them over each
week. The purpose of having a suspense account was simply so that a shortfall
that a subpostmaster does not immediately made good could be temporarily
moved to the suspense account rather than being left in the cash account. By this
time, I was very concerned and contacted the investigations team and asked them

to carry out an audit.

17. In cash account week 48 (the week ending 25 February 2004) the short fall for
that week alone was £3,509.18 (pages 148 to 159). Mr Castleton informed me
that he and his assistant Mrs Christine Train spent many hours double checking
the transaction logs to try to prove that it was the computer equipment that was
changing the figures. I asked him if he had found anything, but he had not.
However, he was convinced that since he had a processor changed about the time
the losses started occurring that it was the processor that was causing the losses.

1A.1107486,3 5
I asked Mr Castleton to contact Fujitsu services (who were responsible for
designing, implementing and operating the Horizon system) to obtain a system
check. He did this and the system check came back fine. I asked Mr Castleton to
contact the Horizon system helpline (HSH) which he did and I understand that he
sent cash accounts to the National Business Support Centre (NBSC) to review, I
also asked Mr Castleton to contact the Post Office’s Transaction Processing section
to see whether there were any error notices pending.

18. On 27 February 2004, I visited the Marine Drive Branch and we discussed the
losses shown in the various cash account figures again. Mr Castleton became
distressed and angry and Mrs Train was also upset. I asked them what else I
could do to help. We had discussed all the usual possibilities. Mr Castleton and
Mrs Train repeated that they had not taken the money and that it must be the
Horizon system. Mr Castleton stated that HSH had confirmed that the Horizon
system was working correctly, but he was not sure precisely what HSH had
checked.

19. Mr Castleton thought that the 2 computer processors were not communicating with
each other and that when he remmed in the stock the Horizon system altered the
figures. (When stock or cash (“a remittance”) is delivered to a branch, the sub
postmaster is obliged to physically check that the stock and cash matches that
which the Post Office say is delivered [do they get a covering note or stock list
with the delivery? If not, how does the sbpmr know what the P.O says is
being delivered?] and enters the details of the remittance into the branch's
computer, which is called “remming in”). To prove whether or not the Horizon
system had changed anything I suggested that he:

a. firstly print out an end of day snapshot;
b. remmed in; and then
c print out a second snapshot.

I advised that if the 2 computer processors were not communicating, then work
done on the second machine would not show up on the summary sheets.
However, all the Pensions and Allowances reports and the Giro Bank receipts
agreed with the information from the computer, which to me suggested that there

was no computer error.

Shortfalls in March 2004

20.In the week ending 3 March 2004 (cash account week 49), Mr Castleton
transferred the previous weeks balance to the suspense account. The suspense
account then totalled £11,752.78. In addition, the Marine Drive Branch Cash
Account showed a further shortage of £3,512.26 (pages 160 to 171). Mr Castleton
did not make good this amount.

21. In the week ending 10 March 2004 (cash account week 50) the previous week’s
shortage of £3,512.26 was rolled over and the shortage in the cash account
increased to £10,653.11 (pages 172 to 183).

22. In the week ending 17 March 2004 (cash account week 51), the Marine Drive
Branch showed a shortage in the cash account of £11,210.56 plus a shortage in
the suspense account of £11,752.78 (pages 184 to 189).

Audit on 23 March 2004

23, On 23 March 2004, Helen Rose (nee Hollingworth) of the Post Office carried out an
audit of the Marine Drive Branch together with Chris Taylor. The audit concluded
that there was a total unauthorised shortfall of £25,758.75 (page 1).

24. I arrived at the Marine Drive Branch in the afternoon of 23 March 2004 and took
Mr Castleton into the back room to speak to him. I told him that as a
precautionary measure, and with his permission, I would like to remove him and
his staff from the Marine Drive Branch and to operate the branch with a temporary
post master to see how it would balance. I wanted the temporary subpostmaster
to retain the same Horizon system that Mr Castleton and his team had been
working with to try and keep everything the same. Mr Castleton and his assistant
Mrs Train were both angry. Mr Castleton said that he could not wait until the
temporary sub postmaster was “thousands short next week” and that “heads will
roll” for the distress that he had suffered.

25. On the same day, Lesley Joyce (the Post Office’s contract manager) wrote to Mr

Castleton to confirm that he was suspended as a precautionary measure pending
further investigations (page 3).

1A_1107486_3 7
Events following Mr Castleton’s suspension

26. I asked a very experienced post master, Mrs Ruth Simpson, from the First Lane
Post Office in Hull if she would run the Marine Drive Branch on a temporary basis.
Mrs Simpson agreed, but was only able to run the Marine Drive Branch for a few
weeks as she had other commitments. She opened the Marine Drive Branch on
the morning of Wednesday 24 March 2004 and balanced £2.14 short on that night.
She brought with her a part time assistant to help out on Mondays. On the close
of business on the first Monday (the week ending 31 March 2004), she was £100
short and explained that this was because her assistant had left something in the
stack and erroneously paid this amount twice. (The stack is an on screen list of
transactions for the individual customer that is being served at the time. Each
time a new customer is served, the stack should be cleared so that it starts from
zero). A copy of the Cash Account for that week is at pages 196 to 201,

27.1 telephoned Mr Castleton to see what his reaction would be. He stated that Mrs
Simpson was only using 1 computer rather than 2 as he had done, so it was not a
true reflection of how he ran the Marine Drive Branch. He also stated that Mrs
Simpson had misbalanced (i.e there was a shortfall of £100). I said that I would
speak with Mrs Simpson regarding his concerns. I contacted her and asked her to
use both machines. She stated that on a Monday she had 2 people working all
day, so 2 machines were used, The rest of the week she was on her own, but
logged on to the system with 2 usernames and had 2 machines running, she was
serving customers from both machines, remming in on both and putting the lottery
cash on both.

28. On the week ending 7 April 2004 (cash account week 02), Mrs Simpson was
£19.38 over (pages 202 to 207). We discussed how she was getting on every
other day and she would text me to confirm that she was okay. On her next
balance for the week ending 14 April 2004 (cash account week 03) she was £10.76
short (pages 208 to 213).

29. On 16 April 2004, I visited the Marine Drive Branch and spoke to Mr Castleton
away from the counter. He was distressed. We discussed Mrs Simpson’s balancing
results. Mrs Train wanted to know where the £100 shortage had gone in Mrs
Simpson’s first full week and I explained what she had thought. Mrs Train became
aggressive and threatening. I said that I felt the balance reflected any normal

1A_1107486_3 8

POL00071231
POL00071231
Sub-Post Office. Mr Castleton again stated that it was the computer that was
making the losses. I told Mr Castleton that Mrs Simpson would be finishing on
Wednesday 21 April 2004 due to other commitments and said that I wanted more
time and more balance results and wanted another temporary subpostmaster to
take over. Mr Castleton said that he did not wish to go back on the counter as

things stood anyway.

30. On the week ending Wednesday 21 April 2004, (cash account week 04) there was
a surplus for the week of £0.02 (pages 214 to 219). Mr Greg Booth took over as
temporary Sub-Postmaster on the same day. He completed his first week on
Wednesday 28 April 2004 and declared a gain of £14.76 (pages 220 to 225).

31. On 23 April, Mr Franks (Mr Castleton’s father-in-law) contacted me by telephone
to discuss the way in which Mr and Mrs Castleton had been treated. I explained
the situation and told him that the suspension was a precaution and that I was
hoping that by having a temporary Sub-Postmaster in the office, that if there were
any problems with the computer equipment, this would come to light. Mr Franks
demanded that Mr Castleton be reinstated immediately. I referred him to the Post
Office Head of Area, David Mellows-Facer and told him that I could not agree to
reinstate Mr Castleton at the time. I understand that Mr Franks spoke with David
Mellows-Facer and asked for a speedy conclusion to the situation. David Mellows-
Facer spoke to me and asked me whether Mr Castleton could be interviewed as

soon as possible.

32. On 26 April 2004, I wrote to Mr Castleton and stated that there was a shortage of
£25,758.75 and that he had reported large, unexplained losses over the preceding
12 weeks. I asked him to explain the reasons why his contract should not be
terminated summarily (pages 4 and 5).

33. On 28 April 2004, Mr Castleton replied and queried whether the losses existed or
whether they were “a figment of a computer's imagination”. He asked me to send
to him various documents and information (pages 6 and 9).

34. I contacted the Transactions Processing Department again on 29 April 2004 to see
whether there were any outstanding error notices. There was an error for the
National Lottery that had yet to be investigated for £125. There had also been an
error for cheques that later cleared and did not generate an error notice. There
was also an error for an Easy Access Account that had been processed incorrectly.

1A_1107486_3 9

POL00071231
POL00071231
I contacted Girobank to see whether there were any errors outstanding with them.
I asked them to look back to week 43. They looked back as far as week 43 and
came forward to week 02. There was a small error of £1.43, but that would not be
reported. Everything else was fine.

35. Mr Castleton telephoned me on 4 May 2004 and stated that he had found £15,000
of the losses. I asked him where he had found the cash. He stated that the
suspense account had doubled the figures. When he had put the cash into the
suspense account, although the amount was showing in the suspense account, it
was aiso still showing as a loss in the cash account again the next week. Mr
Castleton asked for the suspense account software to be checked. I again
contacted the NBSC to request this.

36. To test whether the suspense account was having any effect on the balance, I
contacted the temporary Sub-Postmaster, Greg Booth on or around 5 May 2004. I
asked him how he was balancing that week on his snapshots. He told me that he
had a few pounds over. I told Mr Booth what Mr Castleton had said about the
suspense account. I asked Mr Booth to put £100 into the shortages line on the
suspense account. First he ran an office snapshot (pages 232 to 233), then he
placed the £100 into the account, then he ran a second snapshot (pages 234 and
235) and a suspense account report (236 and 237). During this time, the same
Horizon kit was still being used by the assistant. The £100 was in the correct place
and the cash figure on the snapshot had changed by £100. This demonstrated that
the system worked correctly. I asked Mr Booth to balance with those amounts still
in the account. He should balance £100 over. I would then call into the Marine
Drive branch on 7 May 2004 and we would take the amount out, to see if the
opposite occurred. Mr Booth left me a message on my telephone later that
evening to state that he had balanced over, just as we had expected.

37. For the week ending 5 May 2004 (cash account week 06), the Marine Drive branch
declared a small gain of £103.11 (pages 226 to 231).

38. On 6 May 2004, I wrote to Mr Castleton and sent to him a copy of an email from
Fujitsu and logs of calls to the NBSC and HSH (pages 10 to 20). I also sent to him
a copy of the Horizon System User Guide, System Failure Sub-Sections 12 and 13
and a copy of the Audit Report (pages 21 to 37). The email from Andrew Price at
the NBSC dated 20 April 2004 to me stated:

1A_1107486_3 10

POL00071231
POL00071231
“The PM sent cash account information to NBSC and it was looked at by
Andrew Wise, he was unable to find any errors. The only amount questioned
was a large amount on the cheques to processing centre which Andrew was
able to confirm was a cheque for the purchase of Premium Bonds. The PM
was advised there was nothing more we could do and we suggested that he
works on a manual system at the side of Horizon to see if any problems
were highlighted. Also, when doing the REMS the PM should take a snapshot
before and after to see if any problems were occurring when doing a
remittance. Andrew Wise and I both feel that the Horizon system is working
properly and we are unable to help the PM any further.”

39. The email from Julie Welsh, Service Delivery Manager HSH Fujitsu Services stated:

“There is no evidence whatsoever of any system problem... please tell the PM
that we have investigated and the discrepancies are caused by the
difference between the transactions they have recorded on the system and
the cash they have declared, and are not being caused by the software or
hardware.” (page 42).

40. On 6 May 2004, I also contacted the Transaction Processing Department at
Chesterfield again to check whether there were any outstanding errors. Only the
easy access error was still showing. I also contacted Mr Castleton by telephone
and informed him that I had received his letter and was doing all I could to get
him the information he had requested. I said that I would probably not be able to
obtain everything that he had asked for.

41. On 7 May 2004, I visited Greg Booth at the Marine drive branch, as arranged.
First he ran an office snapshot (pages 238 to 239), then he removed the £100
from the suspense account and ran a second snapshot (pages 240 to 241) anda
suspense account report (242 to 243). Again, the cash figure in the snapshot and
the suspense account had changed by £100 which demonstrated that the system

worked correctly.
Interview with Mr Castleton on 10 May 2004
42. On 10 May 2004, I interviewed Mr Castleton. Ms Lesley Joyce (Contract Manager)

and Mrs Train were also present. A copy of the Minutes of the interview meeting
are at pages 43 to 45. At the interview, I explained that it was his opportunity to

1A_1107486_3 41

POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231

POL00071231

give any explanation as to why his contract for services should not be terminated.
I summarised the events which lead to his suspension on 23 March 2004 due to an
unexplained shortage at that time of £25,758.75. During the 12 weeks prior to
this audit, the Marine Drive Branch had several large unexplained losses. The
figure for cash on the system was not the same as the physical amount of cash at
the Marine Drive Branch. Mr Castleton stated that the Horizon system was to
blame.

43. I informed Mr Castleton that since he had been suspended, the same Horizon
system had remained in place and that there had not been any further complaints
about it from the Marine Drive Branch and that the cash account showed no large
losses. The Horizon system did crash whilst Mrs Simpson was running the branch,
but when she rebooted it, this did not effect the balance. When Mrs Simpson had
finished, Mr Booth was appointed as a temporary sub postmaster, and again, he
had no problems.

44. Mr Castleton stated that he had not taken any money and that he trusted his staff
not to have taken anything. Mr Castleton said that he had asked for 10 pieces of
information and I explained that I had only received his letter 2 working days prior
to the interview and that I was working on obtaining this.

45. I checked that Mr Castleton understood how the cash account worked with regards
to balances and losses and gains and he confirmed he understood it. I then went
into detail with balances, error notices, losses etc and the evidence I had with the
snapshots and declared cash. I provided all of this information to Mr Castleton,
together with a list of the results of the balance.

46. At the end of each day the subpostmaster is supposed to count their cash [fs that
right?], type the details into their computer stating the quantity of each
denomination they have and then print a cash declaration [is this exactly the
same thing as the ONCH report?) to declare the quantity of cash in the tills
overnight. I referred Mr Castleton to some of the cash declarations which had
been manually altered or written on. Specifically I referred him to week 47 and
also the declaration on 12 February 2004 which had a figure of approximately
£7,000 written onto the bottom of the cash declaration. Mr Castleton thought it
was Mrs Train‘s writing, but she was not sure. I said this was very important
because although the cash account for week 46 showed a loss of £8,243.10, the
following snapshots and declared cash did not match. For example:

4A_1107486_3 12
47.

48.

(a) The balance snapshot timed at 5.27p.m. on 13 February 2004 (page ) showed
that the Marine Drive Branch needed £92,095.36 cash to achieve a perfect
balance. The cash declaration shows that the branch had cash of £99,128.40
(page ), an apparent gain of £7,033.44.

(b) The balance snapshot at 14 February 2004 showed that the Marine Drive
Branch needed £95,896.59 to achieve a perfect balance (page ), but the cash
declaration showed that it actually had £102,706.10 (page ), an apparent
gain of £6,809.51.

(c) The balance snapshot of Monday 16 February 2004 showed that the Marine
Drive Branch needed £77,958.28 to achieve a perfect balance (page ), but
the cash declaration showed that it had £84,909.54 (page ), an apparent gain
of £6,951.26.

(d) The balance snapshot dated Tuesday 17 February 2004 showed that the
Marine Drive Branch needed £68,163.08 to achieve a perfect balance (page ),
but the cash declaration showed that he actually had £74,939.85 (page ), an
apparent gain of £6,776.77.

In other words, according to the cash declarations, the Marine Drive branch had
more cash than it required to balance.

Crucially, the cash account on Wednesday 18 February 2004 showed that the
cash is an exact match for the cash required on the balance. I asked Mr Castleton
where the surplus had gone. He had no explanation and stated that it was
something to do with Horizon. I gave Mr Castleton other examples where there
were shortages in subsequent weeks and that they did not match the snapshot in
the cash declaration.

I explained to Mr Castleton that the Horizon system is a double entry accounting
system and that everything I had checked worked through. The evidence does not
support Mr Castleton’s theory that the Horizon system went wrong when he
entered the stock remittances on to the system.

Post interview

1A_1107486_3 13

POL00071231
POL00071231
49.

50.

After the interview, I sent copies of the cash and suspense accounts to Elizabeth
Morgan and Davlyn Cumberland in Leeds who were two people very experienced
in dealing with the suspense accounts. Neither of them could see anything wrong
with the way that the computers were working.

On 14 May 2004, I wrote to Mr Castleton to clarify the entries at the top of the
final balance that he had queried and to explain why the 2 final balances he had
mentioned did not look similar (page 46). I also sent him a copy of the interview
notes.

Mr Castleton‘s dismissal

Si.

52.

53.

54.

Mr Castleton did not provide any evidence of a computer problem. All the entries
in his cash accounts were double checked. The figure declared for cash on the
system did not match the physical amount of cash he had in his office. This
showed that there was an actual loss, rather than a computer problem.

Mr Castleton denied taking the cash, but he would not take my advice to try
individual balancing, or listen to my suggestion that a member of his staff might

be taking the money.

The Transaction Processing Department at Chesterfield and Girobank have stated
that they had no outstanding error notices to issue. Fujitsu Services had checked
the software and could not find any problems.

Since Mr Castleton had been suspended, the temporary sub postmasters had
worked with exactly the same Horizon kit and the balance had continued to be
fine each day. In the circumstances, I decided to terminate summarily Mr
Castleton’s Contract, due to the large unexplained losses that he had failed to
make good in breach of his Contract. I wrote to Mr Castleton on 17 May 2004 to
confirm that I had decided to terminate summarily the Contract effective from 23
March 2004, the date of his suspension (pages 47 to 48).

Events following Mr Castieton’s dismissal

55.

On 23 May 2004, Mr Castleton wrote to me to confirm that he wished to appeal
against my decision (page 49). He also stated that he was seeking further
information relating to the computer fault. On 1 June 2004 he wrote directly to

1A_1107486_3 14

POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231
POL00071231

David Mellows-Facer for this information (page 50). On 2 June 2004, David
Mellows-Facer replied to Mr Castleton (page 51). I understand that Mr Castleton’s
appeal was dealt with by Mr John Jones, Area Development Manager, which
upheld my decision.

56. In the circumstances, I believed (and still believe) that my decision to dismiss Mr
Castleton was entirely justified.

Outstanding indebtedness

57. At page ( ) is a Former Subpostmasters Accounts Statement of Outstanding Debt.
This shows that the outstanding indebtedness (excluding interest) is £25,858.95.
I should perhaps clarify that the following error notices were not issued until 24
March 2006, but that they relate to 23 March 2006, when Mr Castleton was still in

office:

(a) £176 of this relates to a lottery charge error (i.e. an error notice
against the subpostmaster) (pages ); and

(b) £75.80 relates to a lottery claim error (i.e. an error notice in favour of

the subpostmaster) (pages ).

I believe that the facts stated in this Witness Statement are true.

Horizon System Helpdesk and National Business Support Centre

4. An important element of the support provided to subpostmasters and Counter
Clerks is the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). The HSH is the Horizon user’s first
‘port of call’ in the event of their experiencing a problem with the Horizon system
or requiring advice and guidance. If the system were to malfunction, upon

and that every time stock had been remmed in, they had a loss that night. The
sun-postmaster also stated that the cheques he had recorded on the 10‘ were

showing on the 11" February as well.

The call was escalated to Heather Dryden at HSH. As a sub-postmaster is
supposed to send cheques to the EDS Processing Centre each evening, the next
day you would expect to see the cheque figures cleared to zero on the Horizon
system. The sub-postmaster, initially stated that this had happened more than
once, but when Heather went through his cheques, it had happened just the once.
It appears that the sub-postmaster forgot to cut off and the cheque listing had

two days worth of cheques in it. There is no option to cut off retrospectively ie if
the sub-postmaster reveals that he has not cut off the previous days cheques,
they will show up the next day and a failure to cut off previously cannot be
corrected later. However, the point is that the system will not put the cheques in
the balance and process them twice. It will reconcile each cheque against the
transaction.

22. The clerk was advised that she would need to check her stock position for last

week and then check her rems in summary. This would show the stock that she
should be holding and that figure could be compared with the stock showing in
the adjust stock [what does this mean?] and this would highlight any problems
with the stock on hand. The clerk was advised that we would need her to take
her computer terminal to trial balance this evening and come back to us before
she rolls over so that we can take down any details she can give us. The clerk
confirmed that they are working on a shared stock unit and would call back if

At this point I investigated the matter. The critical event earlier that day was
part of a storm ie a central problem causing lots of event storms which had
occurred over the entire Horizon system that night as a result of a faulty software
fix. The KEL had nothing to do with the discrepancies.

Various built in checks occur at the end of each day. For example, the gate way
terminal will total all the transactions. The gate way terminal will only send in
information from these built in checks, once all the terminals in the branch have
communicated with it. Reports are only produced if there are discrepancies. A
weekly cash account is produced and sent to the data centre. The gate way
terminal will do daily cash accounts. This is summarised weekly and compared to
the weekly branch cash account to check for discrepancies. The data centre also
produces a weekly cash account which is compared to the branch weekly cash
accounts. There are therefore effectively three weekly cash ecounts:

a) The branch weekly cash accounts;

b) The branch daily accounts, which is accumulat

at the weekend; and

c) The data centre weekly cash account.

I checked the discrepancies between these hree accounts and found none.
Cheques were handled correctly (as far as the mM was concerned). I also

I was surprised to discover that at the end of the day, the cash the branch

declared in the drawer was tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds stray from
what they had recorded on the system. This meant that it was possible that the
sub-postmaster was not accurately recording ail transactions on the system,
although if that had been the case, an error notice or error notices would have
been generated to explain the discrepancy.

There was no evidence whatsoever of any system problem. I therefore asked
HSH to revert to the sub-postmaster and explain that we have investigated and

the discrepancies are caused by the difference between the transactions they
