RE: Receipts payments missmatch issue

Gareth,
Initial comments:

1. Happy to run the extract from the BRSS. Cheryl, can look at this please.

2. Tivoli only gives us a 30 day view of events. lan, does it store more than that? If so could you arrange an extract
please

3. To do any fix we would need a lot more detail on exactly what was required.

4. Agree that the calls don't seem to have been raised correctly. Saheed/Sandie not sure where the responsibility for
counter events currently is, but we need to plug this gap.

5. Mike(s) we need someone to run with this and engage the customer please.

Cheryl can you check out the attachment and let me know any comments or areas I've missed. Thanks.

Regards,
Mark.

Receipts payments mismatch issue

Mark,

The attached note summarises the problem and describes what we need to do to identify the full scope of the problem
and discuss with POL if / how we fix the problem.

<< File: Lost Discrepancies.doc >>
Initially I'd appreciate your feedback on the note and also with initiating the data retrieval identified in Section 3 to fully
scope the problem.

We probably need to formally raise this as a problem with POL. I'm not sure how this is done, but presumably you can
initiate that. We should then plan to do the initial analysis and provide POL with a view as to the scope and then agree
how to progress it.

I'm happy to continue to be involved in assisting with the analysis and discussion with POL, but presumably the bulk of the
work can be done by SSC.

Jon is easily able to reproduce the problem in a development environment and we are planning to recreate the scenario
and attempt a fix in that environment in the next couple of days. However it is probably worth starting on the data
extraction to ascertain the full scope of the issue asap since it has probably been around since day one and data more
than 6 months old is being dropped from BRSS, so the sooner we run the queries the better.

Happy to get together to agree how to progress this.

In terms of process, do you want me to attach this note to Peak PC0204765 and return the Peak to SSC?
Regards

Gareth
