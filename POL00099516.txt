POLB 13/52 HORIZON

(a) The CEO apologised for the short notice in keeping the Board
updated but explained that issues had arisen over the last couple of
days. She gave an update on the Horizon review which was being
undertaken by Second Sight and their interim report which was to
be presented at a meeting of MPs on the 8" July. The investigation
to date had found no systemic issues with the Horizon computer
system but had highlighted areas for improvement in support areas
such as training.

(b) The CEO explained that the Horizon, like any large computer
system, would occasionally have anomalies and two were know of
over recent years. The Business had dealt with these anomalies to
ensure no sub postmaster was out of pocket and these anomalies
had not affected any of the cases which Second Sight had
reviewed. Second Sight had been told of these anomalies and they
would include them in their report.

(c) The CEO was concerned that the report from the independent
forensic accountants was not as factual as expected and could lead
to loose language at the MP meeting.

(d) The Board asked the Business to challenge Second Sight to
ACTION: ensure changes were made to the report where possible and asked
CEO/ the Business to prepare their communication to combat any
Mark Davies inaccuracies.
