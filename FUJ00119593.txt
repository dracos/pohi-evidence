RELEASE Ic CONTENTS DESCRIPTION __ Ver: 4.0
Date: 22/09/97

2. INTRODUCTION

In response to the request to consider a phased release of the Horizon system which would
include a release of the system which provides only the Benefit Payment Service (BPS) and
Order Book Control Service (OBCS), this document is intended to provide a definition of the
functional contents believed by ICL Pathway as necessary to support such a release.

In the course of examining the minimum functional requirements of this release it has been
found necessary to extend the functional scope beyond the BPS and OBCS services to include
that minimal element of the EPOSS service necessary to support the primary services. This is
necessary due to the integrated nature of the desktop components of the service and the
consequential interdependency between the products.

3. SCOPE

This document is limited to the functional services required to support a release of the system
which offers only the BPS and OBCS services at the counter, with the supporting
infrastructure necessary to receive and process the encashment of Payment Authorisations and
Control Notice files issued by the Benefits Agency (BA) and to return transaction files to the
BA and to POCL via the ABED interface.

4. RELEASE 1C CONTENTS

4.1 INTRODUCTION

In order to achieve a rapid understanding of the functional content included in the release, the
tables in the following sections describe the functionality in two different ways. In the case of
the Service Infrastructure, POCL Services, Security, Audit, BPS and OBCS, the description is
represented as an exception list against the baseline functionality contained in the Services
Architecture and Design Document (SADD). For EPOSS functionality, due to the restricted
functions provided, the description is expressed as a positive statement of the functions from
the SADD which are to be included. The baseline is the SADD (version 2) and the SFS
Version 2.0; the section headings from these two documents have been used to structure the
Release 1c Content paragraphs which follow this introduction. It should be noted that this
approach introduces a degree of necessary duplication between the paragraph sections. The
references in the descriptions are to the SADD or the SFS.

The Related Agreements, the SADD and the SFS make reference to
documents which form a necessary part of the functional baseline. These
documents and their status at the time that the Release 1c Contents Definition
was produced are listed at Annex I to this document. Not all of the documents
have been agreed with the AUTHORITIES at the time that the document was
prepared and in some cases ICL Pathway has had to develop the system using
draft documents. It can not be assumed that when these documents are agreed
by the AUTHORITIES that the functionality so defined can be included within
Release Ic.

4.2. PFISERVICE ARCHITECTURE

Except where specified below, all the requirements of the PFI Service Architecture will be
met in Release Ic. It should be noted that at Release 1c only one of the Pathway Data Centres
will be operational and that this data centre will communicate to 2 BA ACCs - Livingstone
for the CAPS service and Washington for the OBCS service.

4.10 SECURITY

With the exception of the items listed in the tables below (section 4.6.2 to 4.6.9 below), the
Security functionality for Release Ic will be as required in SFS Version 2.0. The section
headings from the SFS have been used to identify the Release 1c content paragraphs which
have been excluded. Within the SFS extensive use is made of references to the Access
Control Policy. Version 1.0 of the Access Control Policy (ACP) has been approved.
Approval of this version of the ACP is caveated by the need to resolve a number of issues
associated with particular sections of the document. For clarification, the outstanding issues
relate to sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 of the ACP..

4.10.1 INTRODUCTION

For the sake of clarity, the following is a list of the components included in the Release Ic
BPS and OBCS end-to-end systems.

e CAPS Access Service Software running in a secure user partition on
the BA VME environment at Livingstone ACC, protected by a
‘firewall’ system;

e CAPS Link protection utilising Red Pike encrypted secure hash
produced using SHA implemented in software at each end of the link;

© OBCS Access Service Software running in a secure user partition on
the BA VME environment at Washington ACC;

«© 2 Mbit communications connections between the Livingstone and
Washington ACCs and the Pathway Release Ic host system running at
the Wigan Data;

« PAS/CMS and OBCS Oracle Databases running on a Sequent
processor under the control of the Dynix operating system;

e Dynix and Oracle RDBMS standard access control facilities;

© central layer of the TMS message store (correspondence server)
running Riposte software under the Windows NT 4.0 operating system
and utilising the Riposte and NT 4.0 security and access control
functionality and the Riposte secure message replication facilities;

© entropy servers running under NT4.0 and utilising NT4.0 security and
access control functionality;

communications gateway PCs for access to the Card Management
facilities operated by De La Rue via Red-Pike encrypted ISDN links,
running under NT4.0 and utilising NT4.0 security and access control
functionality;

e TMS ‘Agent’ software running on an NT 4.0 platform and utilising
NT4.0 security and access control functionality;

* ISDN communications links connecting the central TMS message store
with the local ‘gateway’ PC located at each Post Office outlet, utilising
CISCO routers configured using CISCO Works and implementing
Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) and Call Line
Identity Protocol (CLIP);

e ISDN Terminal Adaptors at each Post Office Outlet ‘gateway’ PC,
utilising EICON software to implement CHAP and CLIP;

© Post Office outlet PCs (*gateway’ and non-’ gateway’) running Riposte
and NT4.0 and utilising the Riposte (including implementation of
‘roles’) and NT 4.0 security and access control functionality and the
Riposte secure message replication facilities;

e filestore encryption on the Post Office outlet PCs;

© smart token authentication of the PostMaster logon, including
authentication to ‘unlock’ the filestore encryption.

It is believed that the Contracting Authorities have some concerns that it may be possible for
some penetration of the security features to take place during the lifetime of Release 1b.
Whilst such an event is unlikely to pose any threat to the system during Release 1b, concern
exists that this may undermine the integrity of the later releases where the security facilities
would otherwise have prevented such events occurring. In recognition of the fact that the
Release 1b security functionality falls short of the full set of security components defined in
SFS Version 2.0 for the Steady State system, Pathway intend that the following steps be taken
in moving the system from Release 1b to Release 1c where the security is increased:

e the Release 1b Oracle tables containing the Control Notice data, the
central Customer Reference File and the Customer “Nominated Office’
File should be transferred to a new Oracle database at the Live Data
Centres;

e the Release 1b correspondence server layer of the TMS (located at
Feltham) should be archived;

© The Release 1b hardware platforms located in each outlet will be
teplaced by completely new Release 1c hardware delivered from the
Pathway distribution centre and configured with Release 1c software;

© the central and local message stores will be re-populated with OBCS
Control Notice data when Order Books are next presented at the
counter in any particular office;

Migration of the IGL system to the Release Ic environment is to be dealt with in a separate
migration document.

4.10.2 SECURITY COMPONENTS

The security components identified in Section 4 of the SFS will be provided at Release Ic.

4.10.3 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

The identification and authentication components identified in Section 5 of the SFS which
will not be provided at Release Ic are identified below.

e Mitigation:

The administration and control of user accounts on both Dynix and NT platforms is
restricted to a single Security Manager role.

¢ This exclusion only applies in those domains where professional, vetted staff operate
the Pathway computer systems. Vetting is to Northern Ireland Civil Service
standards, and CFM staff are currently undergoing M.o.D, vetting.

¢ CFM operational documentation will be modified to state that it is forbidden for
users to change their User Id.

Management procedures will be put in place to ensure that relevant members of staff
are aware of the SFS requirement, and that disciplinary action is taken against any
offender.

© Any staff member guilty of deliberate contravention will be subject to severe
disciplinary action.

«All operational activity takes place in a physically secure environment. Physical
security components of the Data Centres and support sites in Bootle, Wigan and
Belfast will comply with agreed standards.

© Pathway will create a ‘Code of Practice’ to embody the additional processes
proposed for Release Ic. All affected members of staff will be required to sign an
appropriate undertaking to abide by the Code of Practice and copies will be retained
by the Pathway Security Manager.

Please see associated mitigations in SFS Reference 6.1.2.1.

6.1.2.1 and 6.4.1 Mitigation

* Inthe absence of COSManager, ICL Pathway will apply the principle of least
privilege within the constraints of the Dynix operating system.

¢ This exclusion only applies in the CFM Belfast Data Centre; no interactive Dynix or
NT accounts exist in Bootle or Wigan. Only monitoring accounts exist in Bootle &
Wigan. There are two types of engineering activity undertaken: ‘part swap’ and
“machine rebuild’, Part swap requires no access as diagnostics are run by CFM.
Machine rebuild occurs before Dynix is available. When Dynix becomes available,
CFM staff in Belfast manage the loading of configuration / authentication files

© All CFM staff providing operational support to the Pathway system are dedicated to
the project i.e. they are not involved in work on any other CFM business.

« The CFM Security Manager will allocate roles in accordance with the ACP, utilising
the user account facilities available in Dynix where appropriate.

¢ It is not possible to login directly as <root>. Dynix is configured to only allow
<root> access at the console (which is in Wigan). Belfast users must login with their
unique User Id and sw to <toot>. The su to <root> is logged, BMC Patrol will
monitor the su/og and cause a Tivoli event to be notified if it detects the use of su.

© Roles requiring access to the Dynix operating system will be divided into those with
a legitimate <root> access requirement, and those with no <root> access
requirements at all. In this way, <root> access will be restricted to the absolute
minimum number of users necessary to maintain efficient operation of the system.
For Release Ic that means two senior support staff plus the Security Manager.

© Operational procedures will be introduced in addition to existing physical and
personnel controls; these include but are not limited to:

« Two man working if <root> access is required during the operational day;

© <Root> access outside of the operational day is event driven and is only
available to two members of staff on a rota basis;

© A paper audit log of all such access and reasons.

© The Unix utility ‘BOMverify’ will be scheduled to run at each shifi change to
highlight any changes in file characteristics. Output will be reviewed by the CFM
Security Manager and exceptions escalated to the Pathway Security Manager for
investigation. The BOMverify program compares the Bill of Materials (BOM) of the
specified products to the actual status of each file listed in the BOM as it currently
exists on the system. The information listed in the BOM includes: the mode (read,
write, etc.), owner, group, size and checksum, and hard and symbolic link data.
BOMverify will be run with the ‘-I’ option. When this is specified, no attempts are
made to correct inconsistent files. Inconsistencies are reported with the expected and

6. Systems Management

Solaris Event servers (front end to the Tivoli central system) will not be accessible to
users either locally or remotely other than for maintenance by system administrators.
Therefore there are no security issues for these systems.

NT servers, holding events and notices in Oracle databases, will follow 3.2 for remote
access. Local access will not be available other than for maintenance by system
administrators.

7. MIS

No system level auditing is planned for Release Ic or later. Access and changes to
sensitive data in CCS and Contract Administration, namely SLA and Invoicing, is
recorded. Authentication of users logging into the Oracle system is not recorded but
details of each user viewing or modifying information is audited in tables.

8. Associated NT functionality not available;

e Roles requiring access to the Dynix operating system will be divided into those with
a legitimate <root> access requirement, and those with no <root> access
requirements at all. In this way, <root> access will be restricted to the absolute
minimum number of users necessary to maintain efficient operation of the system.
For Release Ic that means two senior support staff plus the Security Manager.

© Operational procedures will be introduced in addition to existing physical and
personnel controls; these include but are not limited to:

© Two man working if <root> access is required during the operational day:

© <Root> access outside of the operational day is event driven and is only available
to two members of staff on a rota basis:

4.10.11 ACCESS CONTROL ISSUES

The following table identifies the remaining issues raised by the PDA in the area of Access
Control for which there is no agreed resolution at Release Ic..

1. Access differentiation is required at lower than the button
impulse. (e.g. allow a supervisor to create a supervisor but
disallow the creation of a manager.

Resolved by agreement with PDA
Security Management over restriction
of ‘Create User’ facilities to only the
most senior level of user.

1. Once created, the full name and teller ID must not be
accessible for modification by users.

Teller ID is an optional field which is
not used within the application.

1. There is a requirement to restrict password re-usage by
user (preference is password disallow attribute to be set to
3)

This facility is supported only for the
most recent password (i.c. the user
may not enter a new password which
is the same as the one previously
used). Full implementation of
password histories is not currently
supported by NT4 Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs).
Manual Procedure Required at
Release Ic.

4. There is a requirement for the password and user ID
formats to be restricted to a maximum size.

Maximum sizes are not supported by
NT4, Manual Procedure Required at
Release 1c.

1. There is a requirement for logon procedures to comply
with best practice as exemplified within BS 7799 / DITSS
e.g. Computer misuse warnings: unsuccessful logon
attempt warnings.

Computer misuse warnings will be
delivered as part of Release Ic.
Unsuccessful logon attempt warnings
cannot be delivered currently since
NT4.0 does not support the APIs
necessary to determine the status of
the previous logon attempt.

6. User groups which are not appropriate to within outlet use
should not be accessible of viewable from the outlet.

Only groups which are appropriate to
an outlet are displayed. In the event
that an authorised user assigns
multiple roles which include a
‘visitor’ role (e.g. Auditor), the
characteristics of the ‘visitor’ role
take precedence.

4.11 FRAUD RISK MANAGEMENT AND BPS MIS

The requirements and contractual obligations have been taken from the following source
documents:

1. Benefit Payment System MIS Catalogue, Issued Version 4 dated 11 December 1996

2. Fraud Risk Management Service Design, next version following Version 2.0 dated 14 Th.
November 1996 (yet to be issued)

3. Schedule BO1, Requirement 895, Version inclusive of drop-down amendments.

4. Extended Verification Process Requirement, Draft Version 0.5 dated 11 October 1996

At Release Ic, some of the required reports will be passed to the CA clerically rather than
electronically. This will include details of real or suspected fraudulent transactions, sufficient
(as agreed with CA) to support case investigation.

Functionality at Release Ic is documented in “Fraud Risk Management and BPS MIS Release
1 Contents” ref. RS/SPE/0004, again to be updated following issue of new version of

Release Ic includes limited functionality to measure SLAs and to calculate Liquidated

Operational Trial, and that Actual System Component Times will be recorded by the system.
The exact mechanism had not been agreed at the time that the original Release] Contents
Definition was authorised: it remained the subject of discussions and CCNs which may have
had a material impact on measurement methods. Consequently, the way in which Release Ic
measures the SLAs may not correspond with what was ultimately agreed for Schedule BO3
and its replacement Schedules. Any such differences will be addressed in Release 2.
