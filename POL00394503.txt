Peter,

Richard's request to explain the incidents is a request that we are getting from many parties i.e. Tom Fitzgerald, Anne
Cruttenden, IRF, John Bruce, Ray Jackson etc. Would it be possible to have an explanation of the incidents, the impact it
has on the front line, and when they are proposed to be fixed. This is something that these parties keep asking for and
unfortunately I don't have the background to document it all.

If there is anything I can help out with I am happy to do so but I'm afraid I don't have the knowledge to do it.

Kind regards,

Sukhi

Next steps:

1. The incidents need to be explained to Beth Newton who manages the Problem Management team.

2. Beth will log these in a repository such that once services go live the team are able to match any live incidents to
these known incidents

3. Beth will then feed into John Bruce whether the incidents should be fixed in future releases based on any information
from live service analysis

Sound ok?

Peter - As promised attached is a list of those faults raised during $60
Functional Testing which may have a Business impact and which I have either
recommended for deferral or they have been included in the Known Error Log.
Please review and let me know if we have your agreement that these can be
deferred to a Future Release. Obviously, for those raised in your testing
where I have agreed to provide a forecast Release I am pursuing these with
development.
