2 Introduction

This section describes the objective of the document, any history of its production and other background
information, but excludes material that is already contained in the preceding document control sections.

2.1 Purpose

The content of this document is intended to outline the requirements and process design for the Deployment of
the PO Ltd Financial Systems project. It is intended to act as a reference for those involved in the various
stages of design, development, deployment and support for the PO Ltd Financial Systems project. It is also
intended to support the concurrence and approval process required for this system to be implemented.

This Conceptual Design will inform, and be updated by, the detailed system design and
build stage of POL FS. During this stage, more detailed analysis will be undertaken to
inform:
The build of POL FS to ensure accurate and timely product accounting, settlement
and reporting to clients;
The requirement for other systems to meet POL product or service related
requirements that cannot be met by the POL FS generic design (e.g. reporting to
clients of information not held in POLFS or Data Warehouse);
Specific reporting requirements; and
Migration plans and activity.

In support of the Detailed Design stage, POL's products and services will need to be
analysed in the context of the sales and stock reporting enhancements available as part of
the overall Impact Programme design. Business decisions will need to be taken so that
individual product offerings can be revised and proposed to clients that provide a
commercially balanced approach to ensuring:

Materially accurate product accounting, client settlement and achievement of

agreed client reporting commitments (as revised); and

Minimal overall cost of reporting and any product verification activity

2.2 Scope

The scope of Release 3 builds on all the requirements and functionality delivered during Release 1. See
Reference document.

The scope of this project is: -
Replacing the auditable financial ledgers of the Post Office Network of Branches, and Cash and Stock centres
currently provided by Class. These ledgers will also hold volumes of transactions/stock where required.

This will include the following:

e Daily interface from SAP ADS to pick up all financial information from SAP ADS and hence replacing the
current weekly cash account.

eDaily interface files from Horizon that will supply the financial ledgers with branch activity that has an
impact on either financial or stock positions, and hence replace the weekly cash account.

e Daily interface from YANTRA to pick up all stock movements in NSSC.

eDaily interface from STAMPS (manual) /SAP ADS to pick up all Bureau Foreign Exchange movements in
Hemel Cash Centre.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POL/IMPACT/DES/R3029

e Periodic interface of Post Office Network financial results to RMG Financial Systems (ESFS).
e Accounting for, reporting and settlement of client funds in line with contractual agreements.

Accounting for amounts to be recovered from current and former Agents and a tool for effectively managing
debt recovery.

Changes to NRDS to provide reference data to POL FS, and control interfaces between POL FS and other
systems.

e Changes to MIS that are required due to the replacement of the legacy systems.

2.2.1 Exclusions

Amounts that relate to Business income or expense, or assets or liabilities are generally excluded from these
ledgers, and hence this project. Exceptions to this rule are where these amounts are recorded at Branches on
Horizon, or at the cash centre on SAP ADS, or entered into POL FS due to contractual requirements.

2.3 Background

This document has been produced by Post Office Ltd with the assistance of Fujitsu Services and Prism
Alliance.

The overall IMPACT opportunity was assessed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and Prism Alliance as part of
the 'Working Together’ joint working initiative. This initiative comprises part of the IMPACT programme and is

intended to deliver new Financial Ledger processes to enable a more accurate reflection of the results and
position of Post Office network.

2.4 Document Explanations

2.4.1 Business Process Models

Post Office's High Level functional requirements are represented in the form of IDEF Process models using
Business functions and information flows. The common tool used for creating these Process Models is Popkin
Systems Architect.

Detail Processes are represented in the form of Swimlanes, showing roles, business process, information flows
and relevant technologies. The tool used for creating Swimlanes is IGRAFX.

Process Models and Detailed Processes are both show in sequence in section 7.

3 Overview

3.1. Business Proposition

The main business proposition is the replacement of CLASS financial Ledgers with more effective and flexible
financial ledgers.

The business drivers behind this are:

POL00038885
POL00038885

Conceptual Design Project: POLFS

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POL/IMPACT/DES/R3029

General Accounting:
e  Rationalise systems in place to report client and business information.
Adopting standardised business processes around best practice
To report Business and Client information separately and accurately.
Alignment of management and accounting information
Accounting period alignment - branch currently Wednesday, business Sunday.
Improve timing, accuracy, granularity and summarisation levels.
Establish an appropriate and flexible accounting hierarchy
Performance measures of throughputs and the actual financial debt
Enable proper accounting of cash and stock
To increase accounting control of branches
Cash centre accounting is manual, weekly, therefore no through view from transaction to settlement.

Client Settlement:
e — Significant reduction of losses from remittances and client settlement
e Long term aim to account and settle on our data, not clients
¢ Optimisation of cashflow

Exception Handling:

e Reducing resolution time and automating exception handling
¢ — Identification of individual discrepancies

Debt Recovery
e — Improved Debt Recovery (financial recovery of money), target 95% of debt incurred
e For 2005 the target is reduction of aged debt from 42 to 35 days
e Establish a central debt monitoring environment, for both business and transaction debts, to enable
the identification of debt with a high degree of accuracy.
e To modify the method of recovering debt by balance rather than each individual item.

Stock Ledger
e Increased visibility of stock & foreign exchange in the network
e Increase accountability on Postmasters for stock leading to reduced losses
e Support future inventory management practice

3.2 Functional Summary

The following depicts the high level processes and information flows involving these processes. See Section 7
for High Level Process Diagrams.

3.2.1. General Accounting

The General Ledger will show the balance sheet position of the PO Network. There will be control accounts
linked to the “Client” ledger, “Agent” ledger, and “Stock ledger’. These control accounts will provide
summarised real time information of activity controlled within these integrated ledgers.

As well as these control accounts the General Ledger Balance Sheet will also show Inter Company, and
“suspense” accounts. There will also be a small element of P&L accounts for items of Business income and
expense that need to be recorded in POL FS.

All this is in addition to the Cash and Bank accounts from Release 1.

Conceptual Design Project: POLFS

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POL/IMPACT/DES/R3029

Client Ledger

The client ledger will record all activity by product settlement group, branch/cash centre and trading date. This
information will be interfaced from Horizon or SAP ADS as appropriate.

The product settlement group is a group of client products that are settled under the same contractual terms,
and such that the client does not need additional analysis at time of settlement.

Where settlement is based on estimated or client data this information will be entered into the client ledger at an
appropriate level of detail.

The client ledger will provide basic matching/comparison functionality between estimated or client data, and
actual data interfaced from Horizon. The ability to match data from clients is limited to branch and trading day
for each client product, subject to POL FS recording daily summarised transactions by the individual product.

The client ledger will also provide control and management of the settlement process and reconciliation
(including transaction volumes) of contractual client documents such as National Audit Office statements.

Agent Ledger

The Agent Ledger will provide a permanent account for each current and former PO Agents including the ability
to group branches under a single franchise or a multiple contract.

Branch Transaction Corrections will be entered in the Agent ledger and interfaced to Horizon for action by the
Agent.

The Agent ledger will facilitate reporting and management of debt recovery from all Agents.

Stock Recording and Accounting

Stock is recorded in Materials Management (MM) module of POL FS. Where stock has a balance sheet value
this value will also appear in the relevant stock control accounts in the General ledger.

Most of the stock quantity activity will be interfaced from Horizon daily as part of the financial activity in each
branch. Stock activity incorporates remittances into and out of branches, “sales”, and adjustments/write offs.

Activity of stock from NSSC, Hemel, will also be input into MM. It is planned that the new Yantra system will

provide an electronic interface of this information. If this does not occur then this information will be input
manually as it is today.

4 Constraints

The requirements throughout this document are generic to all suppliers unless stated otherwise. Gaps in the
fequirement numbers represent requirements that have been removed, and the numbering has been retained for
clarity.

4.1 High Level Functional

Ref Requirement Description

FIH 001 Introduction of a new financial system (POL FS) to produce the financial ledgers for Post Office Ltd
(POL) to report to Royal Mail Group using simplified business processes and reduced duplication and
requirement for reconciliation

FIH 002 Introduction of a Client Ledger, Agent Ledger, Stock Ledger to enable standard procedures for Debt
Recovery and monitoring. To enable the capture, validation, verification and correction of client
transaction data.

FIH 003 Produce POL Ledgers to report P&L and BS for POL in so far as the transactions are handled within the
POL environment with a stream of data from branches and cash centres

FIH 004 The Cash and Bank account values, from ledger implemented in S60, will not be overwritten with
CLASS values at S80 implementation. A reconciliation will be undertaken between POL FS and CLASS
as part of cutover activities

4.2 Dependencies and Assumptions

Ref Description

ASS 001 Supplementary document matching will not take place in POL FS and will largely be stopped.

ASS 002 Matching of client transaction data to POL FS data will not take place on POL FS. This will take place in
MI where necessary.

ASS 003 Matching of client summary data to POL FS data will be done on a risk based approach.

ASS 008 Reporting of data to clients from POL FS will be at the maximum level of Branch, Trading Day &
Product.

ASS 004 Reporting of transaction data to clients will not take place on POL FS. This information will either be fed
to clients directly (e.g. AP/Banking), or is available from MI.

ASS 005 Depending upon where it resides at the time of S80 implementation, Foreign Exchange movements
to/from cash centres will be received by POL FS either by an automated feed from SAP ADS or by the
manual input of output from STAMPS.

ASS 006 In order that some of the existing controls can be removed, there is a plan of migration of some
products/services to Automated Payments process. This piece of work is with Sales and Marketing. If
this is not completed then there are some controls, which currently exist in the legacy systems that are
not being designed within POL FS. These controls will be replicated in another system, to be defined.

ASS 007 Itis assumed that an electronic feed of stock movements to/from the branch network will be provided by
the YANTRA System that should have replaced the STAMPS System before S80 implementation.

ASS 009 Dependency on Client Managers to ensure clients accept changes to client reporting of POL data — in
particular Girobank and NS&l.

Conceptual Design Project: POL FS
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POL/IMPACT/DES/R3029

Ref Requirement Description
CHH 006 I The interface will provide a snapshot of all transactions at approx midnight and must be available within the
POL FS by 07:30 the following day
CH 001 The Cash Centre Trading Statement will replace the current cash account process.

The statement is an internal document for the cash centre only and will not be forwarded to an independent
area unless security and audit determine that that is essential. The actual data within the trading statement
will have already populated the ledgers by the daily interface outlined above and therefore no data from the
statement will populate the interface.

The trading statement will encompass a snapshot of cash and stock and also any current discrepancies or
suspense items. It will also enable the cash centre to view what business has been transacted over the last
period. The cash centre manager will be required to “sign off” the trading statement as a true and accurate
position at specified points in time.

It is possible that the SAP/ADS system can produce the level of information required which would satisfy
both control issues and security and audit requirements.
The Trading Statement is being developed independently of POL FS by CL&S.

8.1 A3 Stock Management

POL FS is a recording and accounting system for stock management that occurs on systems outside POL FS.
The NSSC is currently going through a project implementing a stock warehouse system called Yantra.

Stock at Branches is controlled on Horizon.

POL FS will receive stock receipt, despatch and write off information from Yantra. The assumption is that there will be a
daily electronic feed of cash centre stock movements from Yantra. If the electronic feed out of Yantra is not developed
then this information will be entered into POL FS manually.

All stock information from Horizon will be passed in the Summarised Branch Data process below.

8.2 A43 Summarise Transaction Data

8.2.1 Summarised Branch Data

The process feeding into POL Ledgers is by a daily interface from Horizon.

8.3 Client Settlement to Clients A44
The following process descriptions relate to the Swimlane maps in section 7.
8.3.1 A442 Summarise Client Data
Activity I Description
442010 Client sends transaction information to POL. This is at a low level of detail. This can be sent by
email, fax or disc/tape.
442040 Transaction information is received. Transaction Processing require detailed data for comparing
client data to data recorded on Horizon. The data is loaded onto Management Information system.
Where discrepancies are identified, this will be a trigger into the Discrepancy Process to determine
whether the tolerance /threshold levels have been exceeded and, if so, the action to be taken
442020 From the data received from the client, summarised information is generated and loaded onto
POLIFS. Settlement team does not require detail information for settlement to clients
442021 The information provided by the client may include a summary total. Where this is the case, the
Settlement team compare summarised data total (generated above) and compare to the client-
provided summarised total. If there is a mismatch, then the client is notified.
442030 Summarised totals (By Settlement Group By Period) are entered into Client Holding Account. This
sets up the amounts due on a particular day to each client.
However, this will be a trigger into the Discrepancy and Resolve Discrepancy Processes to
determine whether the tolerance/threshold levels (at business total level) have been exceeded and,
if so, the action to be taken
The precise requirements of client data feeds will be defined during the system design phase.
8.3.2 A443 Calculate and Settle on Estimated Amounts
Activity Description
443010 Estimate falls due. The estimation cycle and period is different for each client - e.g.
Girobank estimates on a monthly cycle; BBC estimates are on a 3 - 4 day cycle.
443020 Local Business Knowledge. This activity involves the ongoing collection of information
relating to an individual client. This includes knowledge of business cycles, public
holiday effects, and trend in business.
443030 Product change Process. This process is outside the scope of this swimlane but
specifically feeds into the local business knowledge in the settlement dept.
443040 Combine inputs is the activity of bringing together all the information that is used to
calculate the estimate(s)
443050 Calculate estimate(s)
443060 Inform client in advance. The estimated payments are communicated to the client.
This is currently manual.
443070 Agree Payment amount. The estimated payments are mutually agreed between POL
and client. Some clients are more proactive than others in agreeing the estimates.

Conceptual Design Project: Automated Ledgers
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POL/IMPACTIDESI**
Activity Description
443080 Negotiate payment value
443090 Enter into Client Ledger on POL FS to generate payments.

This will involve a journal with both sides going to the Client a/c.

The payment value will be posted to the payment area of the Client a/c and the
balancing entry will be posted to the comparison area of the Client a/c.

8.3.3 A444 Discrepancy Process — Errors identified by Clients

Activity Description

444100 Paperwork is sent by each branch on a daily/veekly basis to clients

444120 Client is sent electronic summary information based daily transaction summaries. (Currently
sent weekly)

444110 On receipt of the paper work and the electronic information, the client carries out their own

444130 matching and verification (using their own systems)

444140 Where errors are identified, then the client notifies POL of errors and send any appropriate
supporting evidence to POL (Girobank also adjusts settlement)

444150 The errors are investigated as part of the A45 Resolve Discrepancies process

444185 The investigation undertaken in the Resolve Discrepancies process may result in there being
errors in the errors summary provided by the client. In this case, the summary errors are sent
back to the client (via fax, e-mail or disc/tape) with the reason for return

444220 The investigation undertaken in the Resolve Discrepancies process may result in the error not
being identified and necessitate the paperwork being returned to the client with the reason for
return

444190 On receipt of the returned summary errors (from 444185), the client investigates and makes
adjustments to the errors and supporting documentation. If necessary, the client re-issues the
error(s) (via 444150)

444193 Client (Girobank) adjusts settlement expected.

444230 On receipt of the returned paperwork, the client investigates and reissues the error (via
444150) if the discrepancy is correct,

444240 Where the client investigation results in the acknowledgment that the error should not have
been issued, then a charge or claim error notice is issued to POL

8.3.4 A444 Client Discrepancy

Activity Description

444010 Actual Horizon data is received into SAP - the data is summarised by Branch by
Settlement Group By Period

444020 Client data is received into SAP

444030 The Client holding account is reviewed at business total level.

444040 This includes looking at the tolerance / thresholds set and determining whether these

Activity Description

have been exceeded or not (at a business total level).

Where the differences are within the tolerance / threshold level, then no further action
needs to be taken.

However, where they have been exceeded, then the process moves onto activity
444050

444050 A check is made on the client discrepancy information held (this information is not held
on POL-FS — see process A443 and associated support swimlane document)

The detailed client discrepancy information is held by branch by product by period. This
is investigated and the process may then move into the Resolve Discrepancies process

8.3.5 A445 Resolve Exceptions

The key feature of the Resolve Exceptions process is the Transaction Correction. This is the electronic version of the
Error Notice. The Transaction Correction will be raised against the Agent Accounts Receivable account with sufficient
information to identify:

Client product being adjusted

Suspense type being adjusted

Requirement for any write off

Options for resolution by the Agent - make good, request hardship, request more evidence

Information for the Agent so that they are aware of the impact of each option

Horizon will interpret this information to provide an intelligent interface at the branch to carry the appropriate transactions
based on the option chosen by the agent.

Definitions

The term “branch” is used here to cover all the different types of branches — directly-managed, franchised, community,
singleton, local multiples, national multiples.

The process covers all these types of branches — however, there is a difference in the way Transaction Corrections are
handled for Multiple branches and this is reflected in the swim lane document and the activity descriptions below.

8.3.5.1 Resolve Exceptions

Activity Description

445000 Discrepancies identified at the Cash Centres (for example, through mismatch on
Girobank deposits or pouches received from branches) are recorded onto SAPADS. The
information is then sent to POL-FS

445001 A discrepancy has been identified (and this can be by POL, the branch, the client or a
customer)
445002 Identification at the branch of Rem-in discrepancies which has occurred in Cash

Delivery between the branch and Cash Centre

445005 Acheck is made on the client discrepancy system (see process A442 and associated
swimlane support document).

This is a “threshold investigation” to identify any branches which have exceeded the
tolerance/threshold level

N.B. This is a review which takes place on an on-going basis

Activity

Description

445010
445020

This involves looking at the past history of the agent in terms of exceptions already
identified (and possibly written-off or currently being progressed by Debt Recovery) —
plus the trend and history for the particular branch, client, product or service.

N.B. This is a review which takes place on an on-going basis

445030

If the exception is a “surplus” then it may be required to net this off against outstanding
“shortages” if a Transaction Correction is eventually raised.

445040

Record exception against Branch/Agent — precise method of recording to be
determined.

445050

Acheck is made on whether the exceptions identified result in the threshold being
exceeded (this takes into account previous exceptions and Transaction Correction
outstanding).

445055

Where the discrepancies are not sufficient to exceed the threshold level, then
adjustments are made to the agent ledger to indicate that the discrepancy has been
investigated and is below the threshold level

445056
445057

A periodic review is undertaken of adjustments due to discrepancies and these may be
written off

Where threshold levels have been exceeded, then these need to be investigated (via
A444 - Discrepancy Process)

Where initial investigations result in determining that the initial findings were incorrect,
then the process may move onto 445055, 445056, and 445057 (described in the above
2 rows)

This process is also appropriate where the branch or Nominee dispute the Transaction
Correction, by using the Request More Evidence option. This may result in the process
moving onto 445055, 445056, and 445057 (described in the above 2 rows) or a new
(amended) Transaction Correction being issued

445080

Investigations result in a Transaction Correction being issued to the Branch. This is
issued electronically via POL-FS to Horizon

The Transaction Correction will include the appropriate instructions for the branch
manager (as is the case currently for Error Notices)

445085

Unresolved Transaction Corrections will also be regularly reviewed. This should not be
left to the end of Branch Trading Periods or Financial Period ends.

This activity will lead to Exceptions Handling chasing up Branches who have substantial
outstanding Transaction Corrections. (May involve Retail Line)

445090

The Branch manager (at non-Multiples and Multiples) checks on Horizon each day for
the receipt of any Transaction Corrections

445100

The Branch Manager (non-Multiples) or the Nominee (Multiples) dispute the Transaction
Corrections

Transaction Corrections can only be disputed once (on initial issue)
Non-Multiples indicate this via Horizon — Nominees will do so via post/mail.

Where the Nominee accepts the Transaction Correction, then the Nominee can make
the appropriate payment (via Debit or Credit Card or BACS). This is via the process
outlined in process A47 (see swimlane for this process plus the associated swimlane
support document)

445110

Where the Transaction Correction is disputed, more evidence is obtained and further
investigations are undertaken.

Where necessary, further evidence is obtained and the Transaction Correction issued

However, investigations may also result in the Transaction Correction being
cancelled/withdrawn and the process moving onto 445055, 445056, and 445057 (see
above) or a new (amended) Transaction Correction being issued

445120

The Branch Manager accepts the Transaction Correction

For non-Multiples, acceptance is indicated on Horizon via one of the following two
activities.

445121

Accept and Making good the amount of the Transaction Correction. This assumes that
the agent will put the Cash amount of the Transaction Correction in the Branch Till.

445125

Transfer to Central Collection. This sets up the Transaction Correction amount Debt
due for collection in the Agents Debtor account.

The process moves into the Debt Recovery process (A47)

Transfer to Central Collection. This sets up the Transaction Correction amount Debt
due for collection in the Agents Debtor account.

For multiples this records the Transaction Correction as a debt against both the Branch
and Nominee Agent accounts.

445081

For Multiple Branches only, there will be a monthly Multiples Statement produced which
will detail all the Transaction Corrections issued since the last report plus any that are
still outstanding (for example, under investigation, cancelled) or cleared (i.e. made
good).

The report (a physical hard-copy) is issued to the Nominee and includes an Invoice
detailing the amount payable to POL

445082

The Nominee receives the monthly Multiples Statement and decides on whether to
dispute some or all of the Transaction Corrections or make the appropriate payment

445115

The Agent Nominee accepts the Multiples Statement & new Transaction Corrections
accepted by individual branches.

Acceptance of new Transaction Corrections will normally be indicated by payment of
amounts due in agree terms.

activities...

445130

Review write offs to ensure values are understood and controlled by branch.

8.3.6

A446 Authorise and Make Payments

Activity

Description

The trigger points for this process are from the following processes:
¢ A442 -Summarise Client Data
« A443 - Calculate Estimated Amounts For Settlement
« A444 - Exceptions Handling — Client Discrepancy
e A445 - Resolve Discrepancy
e A47- Debt Recovery

POL data will include any adjustments made during the above processes

446010

Review balance outstanding on client ledger to obtain settlement value (actual or estimated) and if
necessary, enter values into client ledger to deduct commission or make other adjustments.

446020

Create system (on-line) payment proposal(s) for the payment(s) due. The creation is controlled by
client standing data (see below for the types of information for inclusion in the standing data which
will enable this to be controlled)

POL00038885

POL00038885
Conceptual Design Project: Automated Ledgers
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POLIMPACTIDES/™*
Activity Description
446025 This is an on-going process and one which includes making changes to client standing data. The

client standing data contains the following types of information for each client:
e Client name
© Client Product
© Client Bank Details

« Payment Method (currently, this is I for CHAPS, E for BACS and C for Cheques,
Swift, Direct Debit (receipts))

e Settlement Terms - (e.g. Next Day; Week in arrears etc)
e Source of Settlement (e.g. POL Data, Client Estimate, Client Actual)

The Client standing data then is a control for the raising of the payment proposal(s) (see 446020
above) and the detailed contract checks (see 446030 below)

446030 Payment proposal to be checked on line — this check is to ensure, for example, that the payment is
in line with the contract, settlement is due, that the payment proposal contains the correct standing
data, etc. Refer to business rules being determined

446050 Payment proposal to be verified on-line — this check is to ensure that the settlement amount is
reasonable and any deviation from the normal amounts is acceptable and explainable. Refer to
business rules being determined.

446060 Amounts due to be paid are discussed between the Team Leader and Manager where necessary

446070 and fully verified. This may be because the amounts vary drastically from the “normal” trend /
range.

446080 Where the team Leader deems the amount to be unreasonable or “beyond the norm’, then the
payment proposal will need to be adjusted as agreed during the discussions above

446090 Approval of payment allows the payment to be made

446095 Information is received by the Cashiers section on the funding required for the approved payments.

This is provided by payment method

(There is a break-out here into the “Funding Process” (which is out-of-scope). This process is
where the cashiers ensure that the funding to make the approved payments is in place)

446096 The Payment Authorisers authorise the payment. This allows the payment to be sent electronically
via BACS or CHAPS, Swift. Receipts may be by Direct Debit.

For Cheque payments (which should be the exception), the cheques are printed (via a Cheque
Printer)

Current authorisation procedure is as follows:
« Where the payment amount is less than £50,000, there is a one-step authorisation
«© Where the payment amount is £50,000 or greater, there is a two-step authorisation

Itis assumed that this will procedure will remain in POL-FS

446097 The printed cheques are then checked for correctness and accuracy and signed and sent to the
client
446098 Remittance advices, showing volume and value by product, are printed and sent to the client -

where the payment is by cheque, the remittance advice is sent with the cheque.

8.4 A45 Client Settlement from Clients

Settlement from clients has historically always relied on the pre-funding based on estimated data. This is shown by the
high level process map A45. The process of calculating estimated amounts due from clients is the same process map
A443,

The new Personal Banking process provides some differences, as this is based on actual data, and so has been
mapped individually.

8.4.1. A453 Personal Banking process

Activity Description

453010 Collection of monies falls due based on payment terms of client

453020 Cashiers are informed of amount to be received — based on daily data from Branch fed
into POL FS

453030 Client pays amount based on electronic information received from banking system (or
based on information supplied by POL to support request).

453040 Amount paid should agree to expectations

453050 Discrepancy reported

453060 Investigations of discrepancy may conclude same day as original payment

453070

453080 Adjust payment if required as soon as possible

453090 Actual payment amount entered into POL-FS.

453100 The Client Ledger is checked and where the amount expected and the amounts paid

agree, then these are matched and cleared.

Where there are differences, then there is a link out to A444 (Discrepancy Process) to
ascertain whether tolerances / thresholds have been exceeded.

8.5 A46 Verification

Verification was identified as a specific process stream at the high level design phase. It was established during a
detailed design scoping period that verification is individual activities that are part of all the other process streams, such
as settlement, and product POL Ledger.

The process illustrated as process A466 was covered as part of the debt recovery process.

8.5.1 Exceptions Identified by Client or Customer

Activity Description

466001 This is the start point of the process. The exception is identified by either the client or

466002 the customer.

466003 Evidence is submitted by the client or the customer — for the customer, this may be, for
example, a till receipt or a utility bill stamped and initialled by the branch

466004

466010 Exceptions handling review and check the evidence

466015 There is also a check made on the customer — for past history and incident history

8.6 A47 Debt Recovery

8.6.1.1 Deduction From Remuneration

Activity Description

470000 This is the start point of the process. A Transaction Correction has been actioned in a
Branch and the amount due will be collected centrally.

470010 The debt is not considered in isolation. Previous debts and debt history is taken into
account to determine the total amount owing at this time. Additionally, consideration is
also given to the following:

e The level of difficulty experienced in the past to recover money;
e Previous hardship cases;

e Problems with making payments or payments made

470030 Debt Recovery section issue a statement of account of outstanding debt.

This is not a one-off activity at the start of the debt recovery process. The statement of
debt will be issued on a regular basis/frequency to notify the Postmaster or the Nominee
of the current outstanding debt amount (level of itemisation is to be determined — current
thinking is that it is a summary of each debt total).

N.B. For the Nominee, the statement is a Multiples Statement (see swimlane
process A455 — Resolve Exceptions plus the associated swimlane support
document)

470040 The Postmaster or Nominee receives the statement of debt, via the Post service.
Acknowledgement of receipt is required.

470045 Retail Line will receive statements from SAP.

Activity Description
470050 Acknowledging the statement of debt, a series of dialogues takes place between the
Postmaster /Nominee and the Debt Recovery Team to determine how the debt is going to
470060 be cleared (in full, by instalments, via remuneration, via credit or debit card, etc.)
If amount to be deducted is more than 25% of pay then DR will automatically arrange
deductions using 25% as max per month and advise postmaster.
470090 Retail Line review Branch positions to ensure they remain viable. (This activity will feed
into other processes that are out of scope of IMPACT).
470100 Debt Recovery arranges for the amount (whether agreed or not) to be deducted for
remuneration.
470110 Once deductions have been made from postmaster or nominee remuneration, then
Payroll Section notify Debt Recovery of the deduction made
470120 The amount owing on the Agent Ledger is adjusted by the amount paid.
8.6.1.2 Collection via Debit/Credit Card or BACS
Activity Description
470040 The Postmaster or Nominee receives the statement of debt, via the Post service.
Acknowledgement of receipt is required.
470130 The Postmaster or Nominee elects to pay off the amount due via credit or debit card. This
is via a telephone call to Debt Recovery who take the details and process the payment via
470160
Streamline
470131 The Nominee may elect to make the payment via BACS
470132 The Nominee notifies POL of payment made via BACS
470120 The amount owing on the Agent Ledger is adjusted by the amount paid.
This journal will also update either the Streamline awaiting clearing account or the BACS
receipts clearing account as appropriate.
470163 Once payment has been banked, as confirmed by Cashiers, Debt Recovery may report
470165 on the amounts cleared. RLM may receive notification of payment made/or not made as
appropriate.
470170 Debt Recovery confirm the repayment to the Postmaster or Nominee
470175
8.6.1.3 Deferment of Payment
Activity Description
470040 The Postmaster or Nominee receives the statement of debt, via the Post service.
Acknowledgement of receipt is required.
470041 If there is no response to the Statement of debt, then after a time-lapse (proposal is that
470180 this should be set to 2 weeks — i.e. 10 working days). Debt Recovery contact the
Postmaster or Nominee and initiate discussions on repayment
470190
470200 The Postmaster or Nominee pleads hardship and maintains that he cannot pay off the

debt either in whole or buy instalments and indicates that there will be an adverse effect
on the business

470210 Debt Recovery note the hardship plea and categorise the debt as deferred
470060 Debt Recovery Team to determine how the debt is going to be cleared (in full, by
instalments, via remuneration, via credit or debit card, etc.)
If amount to be deducted is more than 25% of pay then DR will automatically arrange
deductions using 25% as max per month and advise postmaster.
470220 The deferment is notified to the RLM for further investigation and action
470230 The evidence of the debt is sent to the RLM for further investigation and action
470090 The RLM assesses branch / multiple viability and also whether the contract should be
470091 allowed to continue
470092 The debt is reviewed by the Head of Area who may decide to authorise write-off the
470093 unrecoverable debt amount
470095 Unrecoverable debt written off will update the Agent's account and be shown against

appropriate Profit and Loss account.

8.7 A48 Produce POL Ledger

The majority of Processes are covered in detail design by other processes:

A482_I Produce Branch ledger Covered by Summarise Data from Branches - Data Flow
A483 _I Produce Agent Ledger Covered by Debt recovery Process

A487 _I Produce Borrowings & Investments Ledger_I Release 1

A488 I Produce Stock Ledger Covered by summarise data - Data Flow

8.7.1 A484 Branch Liability Management
The process of managing Branch Liability as part of POL FS is largely a reporting and monitoring process.

All financial information that relates to a branch will be recorded such that the branch is identified as a parameter in the
financial ledgers. A full balance sheet by branch will be available.

This will allow the Retail Line Managers to report on Branch Liability with information that is only a day old. Where this
coincides with the end of a Branch Trading Period then there will be close correlation between the Branch Trading
Statement created on Horizon and any information reported from POL FS.

The information that is recorded in POL FS is based on a particular end of day cut off and, since, this is not necessarily
the same as the cut off point as for the Branch Trading Statement the two reports will also have some timing differences.
Itis therefore recommended that no reconciliation is attempted between the Horizon and POL FS versions of the Liability

Statement.

8.9 Management & Accounting Information

8.9.1 Standard Within POL FS
All Management/ Accounting information in POL FS is limited based on the granularity of data recorded in POL FS.

Although POL FS will capture summary level information of Branch and Cash Centre client transactions, it is not the key
role of POL FS to provide Management Information relating to client activity. This is the role of MIS. POL FS will provide
reports suitable to an auditable standard but this is not Management Information.

POL FS key role relating to the recording of client data is for settlement.

POL FS will provide the following Management Information:
Client Related:
e Value of indebtedness to clients both individually and in total
Value of client indebtedness to POL both individually and in total
Age of indebtedness both individually and in total
Payment History
Overall difference between settlements on client or estimated data and actual value of transactions recorded in

8.9.2 Reporting Requirements From POL FS
The following requirements were identified in the Programme CD relating to data available in POL FS
These requirements were based on extracting the current information requirements from the reports that are
currently run on CBDB/OPTIP.
Further work needs to be done to establish how these requirements translate into requirements against new
processes and data. It is therefore probable that not all details of these information requirements will be
delivered in the way described below.

8.10 New Reference Data System

The NRDS has jurisdiction over the following systems:
Horizon; POL FS; SAP HR.

Itis not in the scope of the NRDS to control reference data on SAP ADS, YANTRA, or ESFS.
The interfaces between these systems and POL FS will be controlled by use of mapping tables.

8.10.1 Shared Data

POL and NRDS have common data that requires interfacing from R3/S80.
The common data entities are:

Master System Data Entities
NRDS Branches
Clients

Products
Agents
Branch Hierarchy

POL FS Chart of Accounts

The maintenance process on NRDS may need some additional changes for S80 subject to a full understanding of the
components of the data that will be maintained on NRDS.

8.10.2 Interface Control

NRDS needs to provide the Reference Data control and mapping for the interfaces between Horizon and POL FS.

There are two components to this:

1) Alogical database linking the various components of the data entities.
2) An Interface to pass this logical database to Horizon where the mapping will take place.

There is a requirement for the logical database to be updated directly in NRDS.

Reviews of this service will be held at agreed intervals, typically monthly. The reviews with each of Prism Alliance
and Fujitsu Services, will be attended by the service managers from POL, together with appropriate operational
and technical managers. The reviews will consider the service performance against the OLA and SLA; the impact
of any forecast service changes; open problems and any service improvements.

Availability and Reliability
The availability of the online SAP service is to be measured between 07:30-19:30 on Monday-Friday (excl. Bank
Holidays).

The service will be measured in 2 parts:
« the host service
« the presentation service

Host Service

e The host service is defined as being available if the SAP host system is available to be logged into and there
are no overnight data load jobs still processing.

The target availability is to be 98.5% (this equates to an average of 4 hours outage per month)

« The maximum downtime permitted during a single outage is 4 hours.

This service level target is to be measured over a period of 1 quarter

Although the service is not measured at the weekends or bank holidays, it is expected that the service should
be available 7 days per week (07:30-19:30), except by agreement. The windows between 19:30 to 07:30 is
available for batch processing

e Support for the Service should be available during the hours of service measurement i.e. 07:30-19:30 Mon-Fri
(excl. Bank Holidays)

tis expected that the host service should be monitored using standard SAP functionality and that the reporting
should fit in within the reporting framework for Horizon.

Client/Network Service
The clientInetwork service is defined as the SAP client and the associated local area networking to reach access
to the service boundary’ at Huthwaite. This is covered with another agreement.

Data Delivery Times

! The service boundary will be defined during contractual discussions

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POV/IMPACT/DES!**

Itis envisaged that the data delivery times will align with current LFS delivery times, although this needs to be
confirmed. Reference the SLA and associated liquidated damages where relevant are stated in Schedule 15.

In particular, the feed from Horizon of daily cash on hand details may require some strengthening to the current
data delivery times which exist for transaction data to TIP. It may be necessary to strengthen this (for example,
utilising the current cash on hand delivery SLA with Fujitsu supplemented by a further SLA with PRISM to ensure
the end to end processing time is met to match the standards of delivery to SAP ADS) in order to deliver the
benefits of increased control over cash movements on a daily basis. This needs to be confirmed.

The end to end delivery time to the ledgers must also be reviewed to ensure that both the delivery of data by
Fujitsu and any subsequent processing necessary within the POL FS ledger is completed by the time reliable
ledger information is required.

The resulting reliability of the ledger entries must be maintained, i.e. the completeness of the daily cash figures
arising from the percentage delivery of transactions must be consistent with existing levels of completeness of the
current weekly cash figures.

The working assumption is that file deliveries will be in line with current deliveries:
e  SAPADS file to be available to POL-FS to enable process completion by 07:30
* Horizon file to be available on the SAP host at 03:00
e — Allother data to be loaded into POL FS to be made available by 03:00
° New reference data to POL FS
¢ — Stock movements from YANTRA to POL FS

Itis a requirement to have all the data loaded by 07:30.
The service level target is that no more than 3 failures to meet this criteria should be allowed in any quarter.

This measurement will exclude failures caused by:
» SAPADS files being made available after 04:00
» Failures caused by incorrect functioning of Prism application code or incorrect configuration of the POL FS
application (e.g. missing FAD)
The service level will be reviewed during the service level discussions on network banking, where service targets
may be moving to annually rather than quarterly

The following files should be produced on POL FS by midnight to enable data to be sent to the target systems and
loaded by 07:30:

>» From POL FS to ESFS

» Transaction information from POL FS to clients

» Transaction information from POL FS to NS&l

> From POL FS to new ref data

» Transaction correction files to TMS

The BACS interface will be scheduled to run during the on-line day.

Help desks
Helpdesk support for POL FS will need to be agreed, and where necessary links between all three systems for
Helpdesk support should be established.

Service level reports
Service Level reports should be produced in line with current service level and operational level reporting, and will
be discussed at a relevant forum.

NB The resulting solution (end to end across all boundaries and suppliers, from initial data capture to final data
delivery) should not significantly impact the run times of the current batch process, and Current operational
achievements should still be met.

Service Fault Diagnosis

Key components of the system should be monitored and alerts raised if there are problems.

Diagnostic tools should be created, so that in the event of a failure, it will be possible to identify where problems
are occurring in the end-to-end service.

The boundary between Fujitsu managed systems and Prism managed systems needs to be monitored to enable
the cause of problems to be swiftly diagnosed

10.3.1 Post Office™
No Additional requirements

10.3.2 Fujitsu Services
y See service levels for the Host Service under section 10.3

10.3.3 Prism Alliance

I Same as current LFS service levels

10.4 Problem Management & Tracking

10.4.1 Incident Management

Whilst the details of incident management need to be worked through, the principle is that PRISM will remain
first port of call for end-user SAP problems, passing any calls onto Fujitsu where appropriate.
Help desk scripts should be updated to reflect any new components introduced in Release 3.

10.4.2 Failure Recovery
Covered in section 10.5

10.4.3 Backup & Recovery
All business data must be backed up daily. Backups should be kept for 4 days before being overwritten.

10.5 Business Continuity

Host Service

There must be contingency arrangements in place for the POL FS service.

The maximum outage during failover is 48 hours

At the end of failover the data must be fully restored, but the system can run with a reduced service in terms of:
e the number of supported users
e end-user response times
e the time by which data loads have to be complete

Presentation Service

POL00038885
POL00038885

Conceptual Design Project: Automated Ledgers

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POV/IMPACT/DES!**

A disaster affecting the Huthwaite site will require failover of the presentation service (ITS and workplace servers).
During failover the presentation service should be capable of supporting 30 users, and printing may be required.

10.6 Training

Additional training is required for all POL Central finance and Transaction processing staff who are identified as
users on the POL Ledgers.

In addition to technical training it is important that these staff are given process awareness training so they
understand how their roles fit into the end to end process and what the dependencies are.

Training will be carried out by POL, but there is a requirement on Prism to provide Knowledge Transfer of the new
system and processes.

11 Technical Requirements

The following generic architectural principals apply:

e The applications should be data driven

e The applications should be module wherever possible thereby allowing
components, such as the presentation layer, to be easily swapped out as more
suitable modules become available.

¢ Minimisation of duplicate functions

e Consolidation of related processes, to minimise movements of data, reduce audit
and reconciliation points

e Adoption of commodity platform products to minimise hardware and associated
support costs and to maximise availability of skilled resources

e Usage of packages, where business requirements can be mapped onto generic
product capabilities

e — Clear separations of functional boundaries to retain flexibility in the future

11.2 Architecture Principles

11.2.1 Application
POL FS is to be built using SAP R3 V4.7 Enterprise with a based of the Retail Industry Solution.

11.2.2 Resilience
The solution should be resilient to a single point of failure.

11.2.3 Performance
The requirement is for the ability to monitor the response times of a limited number of OLTP transactions at the back

end. When combined with monitoring of network response times this will provide Post Office with a view of the overall
response times. It is expected that standard SAP functionality should meet the SAP back-end monitoring requirements.

There are 2 specific performance requirements:

e The service level target is for the average response time of the agreed transactions to be completed within:
"1.5 - <WAN latency>" seconds.
where this measure is taken within the hosting environment (excluding WAN and presentation layers).

« loading of data files as defined in the data delivery section of 10.3

Capacity management of the platform should be brought into the standard Horizon capacity management regime.

11.2.4 Communications

Connectivity of the end-user presentation layer to the POL FS hosting service is to be channelled through Post Office's
Northern Data Centre

11.2.5 Scalability
The solution must be scalable to cope with release 3, specifically in the following areas:

« Audit - For release 3 it is expected that there will 90 days worth of online details, with records being archived
periodically

¢ Volumes - See section 10.1

e Numbers of users - 350 users at release 3 with 20% concurrency

The design proposal should explain how the solution will cope with an increase in the following:

number of end users

¢ number of concurrent end users

e input data volumes

¢ online data volumes

whilst maintaining the contracted service levels. These will constitute the design limits in accordance with the approach
defined in PA/PER/033.

Any ceiling in the solution design should be identified in the design proposal

11.2.6 Systems Management

POL FS infrastructure is expected to be part of Horizon domain and managed as such, including initiation and control of
batch jobs.

POL00038885
POL00038885

Conceptual Design Project: Automated Ledgers

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POV/IMPACT/DES!**

Bespoke processes such as the jobs that process the files fed from Horizon should be monitored.

Itis not expected that test systems will need to set date/time to be something different from the current date/time.
The following service level monitoring is required

«the ability to monitor the response times of a limited number of OLTP transactions at the back end. When combined
with monitoring of network response times this will provide Post Office with a view of the overall response times. It is
expected that standard SAP functionality should meet the SAP back-end monitoring requirements.

Summary Transactions to Clients (Girobank & NS&l) interface
Payments Data to BACS interface

YANTRA to POL FS interface

NRDS to Horizon interface Enhance existing interface.

The types of interfaces will be defined in the associated AIS's for each interface

11.4 Other Technical Requirements

SAP Help should be made available to development and test users from within the SAP client domain?
The SAP host must be able to communicate with the network printers in use within the SAP client domain

All production and test end-user access will be via ITS and workplace.
Development access will be via SAP GUI (on citrix servers)
File transfer access to development and test is required for developers.

12 Security Requirements

The principle is that Horizon data centre and Huthwaite are both trusted domains and should be operating to ISO 17799.
The SAP host should be integrated into the Horizon domain as per the principle defined in Section 5.

The requirements for security then focus on the changes brought about by the introduction of the new SAP service and
the interfaces between the 2 secure data centres. For each of these areas consideration should be given to Identification
and Authentication, Access Controls, Audit and Alarms.

¢ SAP Application
> All persons requiring access to the POL ledgers will have individual user ID with specific access suitable for
their requirements.
> User roles will be set up and administered in line with Consignia's "Security Operating Standards"
» There is no requirement for secondary authentication; standard SAP passwords will be adequate.
> Auditing of who has done what within the application will be provided by standard SAP functionality

e Support access to POL FS hosting systems should be controlled as per current Horizon support access standards
e — Support access to presentation layer systems should be controlled as per current Prism standards

e Network
> Access to data centres systems will be protected through Firewalls
> Firewall logs should be monitored to detect attempts to gain unauthorised access
» IPSEC encryption to be provided by the routers between Horizon data centres and Post Offices Northem Data
Centre

? By SAP client domain this means the end user components of the SAP solution that are managed by Prism.

13.2.1 POL FS Development

Prism Alliance should develop a design proposal to meet the requirements set out in this document and provide
the post office with a commercial proposal which will specify the costs, time-scales and resource implications
for progressing to the solution build and test stage, and the implementation and rollout stage.

13.2.2. SAPADS Development

There was an initial assumption that there would be no changes required for SAP ADS. Since several
processes start on SAP ADS and finish outside SAP ADS it is necessary to pick up these transactions
individually. It is not easy to do this and keep the financial integrity of an interface without making some
changes to SAP ADS.

Prism Alliance will investigate and recommend changes to SAP ADS that do not effect the key operation of the
Cash Centres but will ensure financial integrity of SAP ADS and the interface to POL FS.

Prism Alliance should develop an interface from SAPADS to POL FS for cash centre related data

15 Acceptance

Acceptance takes place upon determining that the Automated Cash & Bank ledgers solution is fit for purpose.
Acceptance for each Requirement will be conducted by one or more of the following methods: -

1. Document review

This method will comprise a document review by Post Office Ltd. of the relevant section of a document or
documents. The classification and contractual status of any documents used for this purpose will remain
unchanged.

2. Post Office Test

This method will comprise tests that run and managed by Post Office Ltd. The actual method of testing, which
may utilise the Post Office Ltd. End-to-End test environment, will typically be used for those aspects of the
solution that can only be verified as part of an overall Post Office End-to-End environment. The Post Office Test
could also include document review.

3. Statement of fact or obligation

This classification will be used for those Requirements that represent an existing Prism obligation, or where the
solution to a Requirement is self-evident and does not lend itself to formal proving.

16 Testing

NB: E2E references within this section refer to E2E testing and not the E2E Programme.

16.1.1 Testing Statement
The testing plan will be based around the following PO Ltd testing statement

Testing will be able to confirm the acceptance criteria for some requirements have been met during the various
test phases. The criteria and the targeted test phase should be identified during the requirements analysis
phase. The testing team should assess the testability of the acceptance criteria during the Requirements
reviews.

An appropriate Test Strategy will be developed to reflect the release contents.

This will include some or all of the following testing phases.

16.1.2 Internal Functional Testing

Gaining assurance of main suppliers internal functional testing via: -
o Review suppliers internal test plans/ scripts for completeness
co Review suppliers internal test results / progress reports
o Review suppliers internal testing fault logs for impact

16.1.3 Non Functional Testing

Due to the nature of this type of testing the aim would be to achieve this via engagement with the supplier in: -
o Supplier document reviews
o Review of supplier test plans / scripts for completeness
o Witness specific key tests during a supplier testing cycle
o Review supplier test results

16.1.5 E2E Integration Testing
This phase is where POL would lead, supported by suppliers, in demonstrating the successful connection of all
the appropriate systems (test versions) in the releases E2E solution including carrying out some E2E test
transactions to confirm the readiness to enter the POL E2E functional testing cycles.

16.1.6 E2E Functional Testing
This phase is where POL would lead, supported by suppliers, in demonstrating through short “days in the life of
the POL business” cycles that the revised systems interact correctly in an E2E manner and with the revised
business process and procedures.

This is also to assure POL that the changes to current systems and the introduction of new systems has not
impacted upon the businesses operation including E2E financial aspects (accounting, reconciliation, settlement,
remuneration) have been and can maintained during live operation. E2E Management Information is
maintained or new information reflects the requirements and business needs.

Successful completion of this phase would lead to the introduction into the live environment via one or more of
the following: -

© apre-pilot (transactions carried out in the passive Post Office)

© pilot (small number of outlets)

o  go-live.( rolled out to the full estate)

16.1.7 Pre-Pilot

This final testing phase is whereby a ‘live’ Post Office is used to test that the connectivity of the live E2E
systems has been achieved and that a small number of transactions representing the changes can be carried
out and report correctly in accounting and management information terms. Completion of this final phase
should be the point of handover to the Implementation team / phase.

16.1.8 Counter & Interface Testing
e — E2E non-functional tests for performance, availability, reliability, volumes etc

Counter sales tests that affect the transactions, to ensure that appropriate data is transferred to back office
systems.

16.1.9 Design / Process Walkthroughs
e — E2E Design and Process walkthroughs may be used.

“An approved test strategy covering all test stages from component testing to direct
interface testing must be agreed between all parties.

17 Implementation & Migration

17.1 Co-ordination of the feeds into POL FS

General

The migration of the financial ledgers from CBDB to POL FS must occur as at the end of a financial period.
The start of all feeds into POL FS must be consistent with this chosen date.

Horizon

The roll out approach of S80 Horizon will govern the cutover strategy required to ensure that reconciling
items are not investigated unnecessarily.

SAP ADS

The feed from SAP ADS will be turned on as a single event rather than cash centre by cash centre. It is
important to co-ordinate this financial period end.

19 Appendix B - Impact Stakeholder Forum Design Principles

Principles/ Working Assumptions for discrepancies

e All discrepancies under £250 should be made good at point of identification. It should not be possible to key a
value of less than £250 into the suspense account. Therefore the quantity of discrepancies flowing up to the
ledger should be significantly reduced

e Transaction corrections required by the branch will be automatically sent to Horizon via a flat file from POL/FS.
This will contain information regarding the correction to be made and how to carry out the correcting transaction

e The correction should be automatic or with minimal intervention (this needs to be confirmed with FUS and may
not be possible)

«Transaction corrections which are not undertaken within stipulated timescales will create an exception report
from POLIFS in order to aid any further investigation

e Transaction corrections supplied by client e.g. Girobank should be automatically communicated to branch
irrespective of value if evidence is available

e Errors identified by client, such as gas bill not paid, should be automatically communicated to branch

irrespective of value if evidence is available

«If the agent request for the value to be taken from salary the Horizon system should have an icon which would
move into “recovery account” therefore clearing the agent suspense. This would flow into agent debt in the
ledger and remove from suspense in the ledger

«For multiples it should be possible to “clear” the error in the same way as above in order for the debt recovery
teams to invoice the “nominee” direct.

e For directly managed branches the transaction correction will always adjust from suspense to recovery account
and then be written off in the ledger.

e The use of a recovery account within Horizon will reduce, or potentially remove, the need for write off vouchers
and REM vouchers. This will lead to efficiencies.

e The differing scenarios for transaction corrections e.g. multiples, directly managed will be managed by
reference data.

e Former subpostmaster debt will be held as agent debt in the ledger. At the point of resignation any value in

suspense will be moved to agent debt.

Principles/ Working Assumptions for stock

e Horizon will record volumes/ quantities only for all transactions, except on sale, or loss, transactions when it will
additionally record value.

e For Balance Sheet Stock - SAP will record data at lower level product information (example Orange £ 5, £
10...) whereas for Non-Balance Sheet Stock — Higher level product information should suffice. Hence, Horizon
will need to provide this level of information. (Yet to investigate this for Hemel)

e We have assumed rem-in and rem-out for all products and no products/ stock items will be excluded.

¢ Line item (product level) details will be available (yet to investigate this for Hemel) to report on stock in transit
(both -stock from Hemel and stock to branches) Tracking of stock in transit is out of scope for Impact
programme.

¢ Unit of Measure for all transactions on Horizon will be the retail sales unit of measure.

Principles/ Working Assumptions for settlements

e Vendor accounts should be set up using standard SAP functionality

e For clients paid on estimates the principle of a “holding” account will apply

e For client paid on their data, currently matched via OpTip, will only be matched if deemed high risk eg Lottery.
Low tisk clients will be paid on their data however the variances will be recorded at a high level and if variances

reach tolerance limit further investigation will take place

e Any client data matching will take place outside of POL/FS

Principles/ Working Assumptions for verification

e — Verification will take place at the branch and within MI not within POL/FS
