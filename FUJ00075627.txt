there needs to be chnage in Standing Data and this is attached.

"Issues" are required for SLA calculation, OBCS "Receipts" are not. This
be progressed as a CSR required deliverable.

PinICL should be raised to 'B' Priority - Fix Required - CSR.
original reason for PinICL being raised has been resolved and PinICL has
moved forward with the PinICL now being used for OBCS specific problem.

pw108 and PW109 are mapped to OBCS Issues only.
pwi08 is mapped to transaction types B911 and J
and U901.

JOBCS Receipts do not contribute to PW108 or PW109. Peter Robinson has stated
Jabove that this is correct.

this only leaves the description fields in the standing data that

confirmed with Peter Robinson what the issue with standing data is, from his
Jpcint of view. It is his understanding that it was agreed between Steve
lMuchow and Terry Austin that the maintenance of standing data would be
carried out by Development. However on attempting to pase the next update of
standing data to Development, it was rejected. P
issue, there is no point in authorising the fix, since it cannot go ahead
until the standing data is amended. I am E-Mailing Stephen and Terry to try
co get the issue resolved. Both Peter Robinson and Richard Brunskill have
confirmed that the problem PinICL should be fixed asap, as the customer
