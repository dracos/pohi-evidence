Important changes:

The map is driven more accurately by project/asset team assessment of risk
Helps ExCo and the Board use their time more effectively

+ ExCo/Board changes/challenges to risk ratings can be more easily transmitted
back to the team

What the Board want

UKGI00017501
UKG100017501

OFFICIAL - SENSITIVE

The way ExCo and the Board use risk
reporting has changed

Risk has become a standing Board discussion
The “Top Risks” list has gone

+ The Top Right Map Boxes will drive Board discussions
Changes in reputational or delivery risk are also reported

The underlying risk reporting data - gathered by the risk registers - has to
be right

The challenge of consistency

Across the UKGI portfolio, we receive 35 risk registers- it is important that we
get them right

Currently, differentiation in how the risk registers are completed means we
are not giving ExCo as consistent a view of risk as we could

We need to standardise the way we think about and report risk across
the UKGI portfolio.

UKGI00017501
UKG100017501

OFFICIAL - SENSITIVE

We want to align our risk reporting
across the UKGI portfolio

Training: Complete CSL Risk Management training to build common
understanding

Probability & Impact guidelines: Use shared guidelines to assess probability
and impact of risks

Reputational and Delivery risk guidelines: Use shared guidelines on how to
assess Reputational Risk and overall Delivery Risk

Standardising summary information: Make sure the risk register summary
boxes give ExCo and the Board the information they need

Risk Training

We would encourage all risk reviewers and those responsible to undergo the
Risk Management training which can be found on the civil service website

You will find this beneficial to understanding how to access and review risks
as well as how to define risks

We will circulate the link to you - it is a desk-top course and takes 1.5hrs

Please let us know when you have completed the training

Guidelines for assessing risks:
Probabiti tye before and after mitigation?

o Extremely high likelihood so prevention highly unlikely

o Identify likely early warning signs to trigger impact reduction measures and recovery

© Contingency plans are vital

4- Highly Likely, but preventable

o Identify early warning signs to trigger prevention.

o Next priorities are likely to be impact reduction and recovery (contingency) if prevention fails
3 - 50/50 Chance

o Good chance of prevention

o Early warning signs should trigger prompt prevention and impact reduction

o Some allowance for recovery time and cost should be considered

2 - Somewhat Unlikely

o Low likelihood & high chance of prevention

o Early warning signs are worthwhile where impact is high, to trigger prevention and reduction
o Contingency of lesser value at this level

1 - Very Unlikely Very low likelihood

o These risks should be recorded and a watch kept, particularly where the potential impact is high

Guidelines for assessing risks: Impact

+ What is the impact of the risk materialising before and after mitigation?
5 - Disastrous impact

probable programme/ project failure; serious damage suffered

4 - Very significant impact

programme/project may fail

3 - Significant Impact

a work-stream/project may be in doubt; damage to the programme

2 - Moderate impact

on cost, schedule, performance

a work-stream/project stage may be in doubt; damage to a work-stream/project
1- Minor impact

on cost, schedule etc.

a deliverable may be late

Reputational risk

A risk that may effect UKGI’s reputation within government and further
afield

UKGI00017501
UKG100017501

OFFICIAL - SENSITIVE

How to work out reputational risk

+ High Risk: very significant risk to the reputation of UKGI, including negative
external publicity, materially impairing the ability of UKGI to deliver against its
objectives in future

+ Medium Risk: significant risk to the reputation of UKGI within Whitehall, which
may discourage key stakeholders from utilising UKGI

+ Low risk: limited reputational impact to UKGI: a project or asset of low public
profile and/or limited repercussive consequences for UKGI of failure of delivery
or governance

When deciding where your project/asset sits on this scale, please have a
qualitative discussion with your responsible director

How to work out overall delivery risk

The overall delivery risk should be worked out by:

+ Using the probability and impact guidelines to score individual risks

- Working out the average score for mitigated risks for your project or asset
+ Use that number as a guide when setting the overall delivery risk rating

There may be instances that one project/asset risk is substantially higher
than the others, which can justify a higher overall delivery risk - this is fine,
provided you can explain why

Remember to...

Before this month’s submission:
+ Ensure your “Overall RAG Rating” box is now called ‘Overall Delivery Risk’
+ Make sure the summary boxes are updated as we’ve set out today

Before next month’s submission:

+ Complete the CSL Risk Management training course, and let us know when you’ve completed
it

+ Make sure that you have appropriately considered each risk, and that they align with your
overall score

+ If they don’t, make the necessary adjustments or explain why not

+ Ensure that your Directors are comfortable with where the risks sit - they will have to
represent the register at the UKGI Board

If in doubt, please don’t hesitate to speak to the risk team
