Peter - under the radar, please see attached. This includes the four pager for the Board tonight, plus the two board
papers considered by the sub committee. Basically recommends option 3 (ditch SS) subject to getting comfortable on JR
risk and ministerial views.

Also attached is the terms of reference (couldn't find electronic copy so scanned it).
Think sub should:

Set scene - what were the initial aspirations i.e. independent investigator

Whats happened - gone native, very slow, expectations rising

Options and risks of each

Think we have to recommend three as best for POL, but has risks - JR, but also political risk

2 is a compromise, but risks SS leaving, but does fit with Terms of Ref

Worth annexing what Jo said in the commons - think we have that somewhere, was an analysis done by Mark R - he
would be happy to share.

Timing - needs to be resolved before recess as it would look bad if we did this before.

Cheers

R

Dear All

You will have seen that we have fitted a Sparrow meeting into Tuesday evening agenda. This follows the Sparrow Sub
Committee which took place today.

The attached papers are circulated on behalf of Mark Davies and Chris Aujard.

There are two annexes which were the papers taken at the sub committee and a summary paper which explains the
debate and sets out the recommendation to the Board.

We will add these papers to Boardpad on Monday.

Thanks
Alwen
