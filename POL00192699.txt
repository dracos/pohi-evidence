Question why have u got to adjust quote 9 RMSF, 10 RMSF large, 1 SD up to 100g. If you sell
these through Business Suite in serve customer screen the stock is adjust automatically. You get
paid the same.

Subject: [SPMRs] Stock adjustments

Thad a phonecall last week from Alex at Chesterfield, to tell me that I had been doing stock
adjustments on postage when I shouldn't have been, and I needed to do a new reversal and a
stock adjustment to fix it. Going back to Ist April the total amount was £885.42. I pointed out
that I never do stock adjustments for postage, but sell and reverse as required. The only time I
ever use stock adjustment is if I have put a cheque through as cash, when I go to stock
adjustment and adjust the cheque figure to correct it. I have checked that my assistant does the
same. He said he would send proof.

Got the letter today and there is according to them, an adjustment going through every
wednesday, when we balance up. So I printed off a transaction log for the last four wednesdays,
and the figures quoted by Chesterfield are being put through as as adjustment by Horizon each
week just after rolling over. I phoned Alex, who put me on to his supervisor. I said we count the
stamps every week, and sell any that are under and reverse any that are over. This is mainly
RMSF and SD stamps, and the odd Ist class or whatever that we have missed. Then I declare
stamps and cash, and roll over. The system then produces this stock adjustment. She said that
doing a stamp declaration is the same as doing a stock adjustment. So I have a discrepancy
showing for every week since Ist April. She says my stamps and cash should balance before I roll
over each week, or else the system produces a discrepancy. She said lots of offices are in the same
situation at the moment.

So what am I doing wrong?

E.g 10 July printed a stock on hand report. Other postage is £413.52.

Counted all the items on the report, short 1 Ist class stamp, 9 RMSF, 10 RMSF large, 1 SD up to
100g.

Put through a sale for all the stamps I am short, total £104.32.

Declared stamps, total £515.24.

POL00192699

Declared cash and currency, rolled over at 17.45.
Transaction log shows the following at 17.46:
DD Postage stamp 1 101.72

DD Surplus disc 1- 101.72-

£101.72 is the difference between the other postage figure before sales and declaration, and after,
(e.g £413.52 + £101.72 = £515.24)

This is the figure that Chesterfield want me to reverse then stock adjust.

T have a figure like this for every week since Ist April.

Should I do what they say, and if so what am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
Rita
