Key Conclusions from the Review

The programme will not be ready for commencement of national rollout
before January 1999 and realistically, will probably not start until early
spring

Whilst we believe that a roll-out rate of 300 PO’s per week could be
achieved with really tight and effective implementation management, we
believe a more realistic rate is 250 per week

These delays mean programme costs are likely to increase by between
- £185mm.and £250mm overall (ie. including Pathway)

For these forecasts to be achieved, significant changes will be needed to
the delivery capability of the programme

Residual strategic risks remain which require more consideration
