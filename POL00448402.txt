Post Office Annual Report & Accounts 2021-22

Key Reports & Statements Vv

On 1 March 2023 we published our Annual Report & Accounts for 2021-22, which you can read in full here.

On 5 May 2023 we published the following clarification and apology to Sir Wyn Williams:

CLARIFICATION TO POST OFFICE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2021-22 AND APOLOGY TO SIR WYN
WILLIAMS.

On 1 March 2023, Post Office Limited published its Annual Report and Accounts for 2021-22. In the section entitled ‘Remuneration
Outcomes’ one of the sub-metrics for the remuneration scheme to help transform the business related to support for the Horizon IT
Inquiry.

Specifically it stated that ‘All required evidence and information supplied on time, with confirmation from Sir Wyn Williams and team
that Post Office's performance supported and enabled the Inquiry to finish in line with expectations’ and the metric was marked as
‘achieved’.

Support for the Inquiry was and is a key objective for the business and senior management in particular. We recognise that by setting
this particular sub-metric, and marking it as achieved, we implied that Sir Wyn and his team had agreed to this sub-metric and had
commented on the outcome. We wish to clarify that we did not ask for Sir Wyn's agreement to the wording of this sub-metric and Sir
Wyn and his team did not give any input into assessing whether it had been met.

Post Office apologises unreservedly to Sir Wyn and the Inquiry team for this mistake and the way it was stated in the Annual Report
for 2021-22. Chief Executive, Nick Read, has chosen to return the remuneration associated with this sub-metric. The Board of the Post
Office is considering the position in respect of other senior leadership beneficiaries of this remuneration sub-metric.

Notes:

Remuneration Outcomes are on page 38 of the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2021-22.

The Transformation Incentive Scheme included a specific sub-metric entitled Inquiry Support, one of nineteen sub-metrics which are
set out on pages 38 to 41 of the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2021-22.

Statement from Chair of the Remuneration Committee of Post Office Limited

As current Chair of the Remuneration Committee of Post Office Limited, I have commissioned an immediate review into the awarding
of payments relating to support given to the Horizon IT Inquiry in the Transformation Incentive Scheme in 2021-22.

The scope of the investigation is to ensure that the Remuneration Committee's policy for rewarding executives, and its implementation,
is consistent with corporate governance best practice.
