Two issues to be considered:

Daily cash declaration

Issue is whether to keep the daily cash declaration as now, or discontinue it. The decision was to make the dec
non mandatory, and look to get some sort of discrepancy MI feed through SAPADS and report this to areas
such as Security.

Current proposed functionality for ONCH system derived figures needs to be checked to ensure this meets
business requirements if the daily dec was removed.

Suspense Account Manual Authorisation process and universal parameter
Previous discussions on if to keep the manual authorisation process for Branches wanting to carry items in
suspense, and whether to have one universal limit of something like £250 for items in Suspense.

The decision reached yesterday by key senior stakeholders was to remove the Suspense Account altogether.
This would force Branches to make good all losses immediately. This needs to be considered in terms of how
Branches can adjust figures, hardship cases, how Branch accounts will be corrected with errors, etc.

Please consider impact on current design to enable implementation of these decisions
