cristina,

It agree from looking at the data that something looks off here.
here are examples of concurrent logins being detected when it appears all the 01 and 02 login are both logged out. At first I
thought it might be a case that the user was logged in at different nodes with the same ID (which is permitted providing other
sessions are locked), but looking at the example for 30th Aug if you track the node logins and logouts, when the concurrent login
as triggered at 12:55, the 01 and 02 logins were both logged out of all nodes.

I thought the issue was that the user was trying to change SU associations whilst having a locked session for the same Horizon
td, but if you look at the below sequence, the starting point for which is that 02 is logged out everywhere and 01 is logged in
to node 5 and locked. By the time you get to Event ID 7 which is basically to denote the event where a user tries to change SU
associations for the same Horizon ID which is logged in elsewhere with a locked session, it is pretty clear that the 01 login is
lonly logged in one place at that time (node 5), so there are no other sessions to ‘mark as failed’.

Furthermore, there is this odd login of the 02 ID at 15:22:28 to SU HH on Node 2, but it is not shown to be logged out when the
luser unlocks the 01 ID on node 5. We know there has been a logout though, as the next event on Node 2 is a No Recovery Message.
oz next logs in at node 2 at 15:25. I am not sure why we see no logout for 02, even if that is a forced logout.

fhe interesting thing is at the time this is happening both 01 and 02 are attached to HH SU, so I am thinking what might be
appening in this case is this:

h. 01 is locked on SU HH

2. 02 logs on to SU HH and is not locked

3. 01 is unlocked kicking ont the 02 login (there should be a message displayed at this point about concurrent sessions, but
Incthing is seen here in Rep Events)

4. This triggers SU HH into a state where a recovery is required
5. 01 then tries to change the attachment. from HH to AA when the SU is in a recovery state and that is triggering the issue.
[this is speculation on my part, but there is clearly something amiss. I suggest you get this raised to the IT Helpdesk with a
jrequest for it to be passed to Fujitsu. Please let me have the reference number for the call when it has been raised, and in the
eantime, I will try and reach out to some contacts in Fujitsu.

Regards

Jcood afternoon,
I looked over the Rep Events Data (I have also attached it to the email).

It have looked at only one user, although the Post Master says this is happening with all users in branch.
Also confirmed that the office was not balancing on any of these dates and times.
[this is what I found, can you please let me know what you think.

[cid:image003.png@01D56183.C26CFBFO]
t*m a bit confused about a few things, so I’ve added my notes below.

Jo. unlocked HH, Node 3
Jo. Log out HH, Node 3

Both users are now logged out - 13:25:09 27-Aug-2019

[13:25:43 27 Aug-2019 - 01 Log out HH, Node 2 - How is this possible?

h3:26:10 27-Aug-2019 - 01 Log out HH, Node 1 ~ Legged out in the different node than the one he logged on

lol Log on HH, Node 1

3:26:35 27-Aug-2019 - 02 Log out HH, Node 1 - 02 is logged onto node 2, so how can it log out on node 1?

Jo2 Log on HH, Node 1

Jol Log on HH, Node 3 ~ 01 looks like it’s logged onto HH on Node 1 and 3 at the same time

Ir don’t know why he is getting the message on this one as he is logged out with 02 user and with 01 user as well, 80 why the

tater on the same day the message comes up again and I have a few questions on this one as well.

sorry about all the questions, I just want to understand this well, so I can explain it to the branch.
Please let me know your views on this, when you can and/or if you need anything else.

sers logon to the counter using a Horizon User ID (HUID) but behind the scenes these are linked to a Smart ID (also known as a
Porp). It is possible for multiple HUIDs to be linked to the same POID.

[the counter should only be displaying message MSG40050 and terminating sessions if the same HUID has an ACTIVE or RECOVERING
session elsewhere, not if they have a different HUID but the same POID.

Itt would appear that the system is incorrectly checking for all HUIDs with the same POID though rather than just checking for the
same HUID with the same POID. Additionally, it is terminating sessions for any HUID with the same POID instead of only
terminating sessions for the HUID they are logged in as.

pco279713 has already been forwarded to development for investigation / fix. There is no financial impact but it is
junderstandably confusing to the users.

in the meantime, the branch users will simply have to accept the current system behaviour.

né unusual aspect is that the REP event order is not backed up by the Counter logs (possible time difference on counters?) Could
this time difference be recorded in the database?

fhe SQL I believe used is PoidSessionAlreadyExists_v:
select s.token id, s.node id, s.branch accounting Code, s.fad hash, @.branch user, s.session_ locked timestamp, s.session_status
from brdb_branch_user_sessions s, brdb branch_user_poid mapping m

coking at the REP events table, we have a couple of timestamps EVENT DATE (which is used in the rep event report above and

insert timestamp) .

I believe that this may be a reporting issue caused by the event date.

Ir will pass this to Jon Hulme to see if he agrees with the analysis. If he does I will then change the HORIce queries to display

the insert timestamp rather than the Event_date.

jburing the investigation of PC0279931 both POL and FJ were confused regarding the order that actions were happening on the

FUJ00171943
FUJ00171943

founters because the reporting event date/time recorded in the GRUB for logon events 12, 101 and 11s, were 34s adrift from other
event date/times recorded.

his is because these events are written by the BAL and EVENT DATE comes from the BAL clock, whereas all the other events are
leritten by the counter and EVENT DATE comes from the counter Clocks.

lfhis also impacts the event date associated EPOSS events 930, 932, and 933 which are sent to Credence.

see BAL class AuthenticationFacade method buildAuditDataMap which has “auditMap.put (IAuditDAO.EVENT DATE, new
Jjava-util.Date());".

I suggest that the event date is set from requestHeader.getTimeSent () which is the time the request message was sent by the
jcounter using the counter clock. GDC should confirm this suggested fix is correct.

ssc should separately investigate why the clocks were 345 adrift. This invesigation will be handled outside of this PEAK
