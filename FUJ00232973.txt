FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

The file integrity monitoring service protects the integrity of personal and sensitive data within the PCI
DSS card holder data environment by checking whether the data and logs are not being altered as
required by the requirements 10.5.5 of the PC] DSS standard and critical system files. Configuration and
content files are monitored as required by requirement 11.5 of the standard.

File integrity monitoring solution (Tripwire) acts to alert personnel about unauthorised modification of
critical system files, configuration files or content files and the software should be configured to perform
critical file comparison at least on a weekly schedule and monitored by security operations under pro-
active monitoring. The software is configured to operate over the platform types detailed in Section 3.1

Platforms of CCD PCI Cardholder Environment (DES/SEC/ION/2006). Those platform types identified
within the table as not having file integrity monitoring deployed to them are platforms implemented using

appliances onto which file integrity monitoring (Tripwire) is not able to be deployed.

File integrity monitoring activities will be provided Monday to Friday from 09:00 to 17:30 Hrs excluding
public holidays.

For the avoidance of doubt, this element of Security Management Service is not provided for those
elements of the HNG-X System migrated to Post Office Cloud.

2.1.12.1 Configuration Management / Baseline reviews:

. The Fujitsu system architect, platform owners and Security operations resources will identify and
agree the initial scanning baseline, identifying files and folders to be scanned and the ones to be
excluded.

. The baseline will require initial reviews to be carried out on a monthly basis until the baseline is
stable and will then require quarterly reviews to be completed.
. Software, Hardware Maintenance and hosting capability in Fujitsu's Data Centre.

2.1.12.2 Weekly Scanning

Scans scheduled to run on a weekly basis on the applicable PCI platforms as detailed in the
CCD PCI Cardholder Environment DES/SEC/ION/2006.

2.1.12.3 Monitoring of Tripwire Service and Scans

A. Carry out checks to confirm that the Tripwire service is running on all the required PCI platforms,
managing any issues / events raised as part of the daily checks.

B. Provide product support to interfacing to the third party, to manage the file integrity monitoring
product tool set.

C. POA security operation will check the output of scheduled scans — review reports produced and
determine why changes occurred and raise an appropriate call for any exceptions that have
been identified that are not covered by operational change activities.

D. POA security will carry out periodic reviews of the baseline on a quarterly basis, identifying any
files/folders that should be excluded/added to the schedules and presented for discussion at the
next review session whilst including the necessary amendments to the baseline for any changes
to the PCI platforms.

E. Scans to be retained for period of 12 months and will be available for review.

2.1.12.4 Reporting

Report requirements to be agreed between POL and Fujitsu these will be produced and made available

2.1.18 MANAGEMENT OF SECURITY RISKS

Fujitsu Services has an approved approach to the management of information security risk for POA
which is documented in POA Information Risk Management Approach.

Fujitsu Services POA is required to conduct a robust programme of risk management (incorporating risk
identification, assessment and mitigation) as a means of determining and confirming the appropriateness
of information related security controls for Programme systems and services. The risk management
programme is, on a day-to-day basis, undertaken by the Fujitsu Services POA IG staff. Although the
options for risk management (i.e. acceptance, transfer, mitigation etc.) are determined by the IG staff
and the decision taken by the appropriate Programme or Operational management team, security risk
oversight lies with the Information Security Management Review Body (ISMR), which is the highest
authority within the Fujitsu Services POA for the management of information security risks.

For the avoidance of doubt, this element of Security Management Service is limited to risks in respect of
the HNG-X Application for those elements of the HNG-X System migrated to Post Office Cloud.

2.1.19 REPORTING

2.1.19.1 Monthly Reporting

Information Governance staff provide a monthly Information Security Reporting Pack which informs the
Management Team, as an input to the Fujitsu Services POA ISMR, of progress towards 1SO27001
compliance, results of audits and current risk status. It is intended that the details contained in this
report will expand over time. This includes reports from the Operational Security Team such as a
summary of the types and numbers of incidents that may impact on the confidentiality, integrity or
availability of POA systems.
