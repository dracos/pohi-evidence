the Horizon Service, where such changes can be implemented wholly by
means of Reference Data and changes to Icons. Where changes can be partly

the change. Future Horizon releases may see more aspects of the service
brought under operational change control, which will be managed by BSM.

ensuring that SLAs are reported on, and in respect of providing the
information that ICL Pathway require in order to operate the Reference

BSM provide such assessments, and where required will undertake
further work to clarify requirements and impacts.

2.1.3. Change Volume Forecasting
BSM will provide forecasts of change activity to ICL Pathway to the
standards agreed in the Interface Agreement [REF.1]. BSM will work
with IAMT to gather and to interpret the data needed to populate the
forecasts.

2.1.4 Change Data Configuration
BSM (OSG) will receive completed OBC forms from IAMT, and using
the data contained therein will configure reference data to meet the
change requirements, validate the result of the implementation of the
reference data on ICL Pathway test systems, and authorise the release
of reference data to the live environment.

2.1.5 AP Client Take On
OSG receive CTO packs from IAMT and manage the systems Legacy
and Horizon ready for the client go live and ensure that the go live is

has been set and agreed (add to annexe).

amended transactions, will monitor and report on the impact of the

scope).

“The core activities of the Change Implementation Team (CIT) include drafting user instruction for Horizon enabled offices. For
more detail see section 8.1.17. The CIT does not contact the TAPT team on behalf of the internal account managers. The process to
obtain TAPT instruction is to contact the TAPT team directly who will than liaise with CIT for automated instructions. I
understand that at the present this process is under review. There is no interface between CIT and the TIP.

*“*Establish baseline following the first review. Agree performance targets for follow up reviews.

OTHER POINTS OF CLARIFICATION:

Release management

Major, transformational releases are managed by dedicated projects under the Automation Directorate. It is the project manager’s
responsibility to liaise with all impacted parties, including IAM. At the time of writing this SLA there are no plans for major
release in the foreseeable future.

If the product requires new functionality the existing Horizon Change Control procedures need to be evoked. Other minor releases
consist of ‘fixes’ that by large have no impact on product implementation process.

OBC Issues

1) BSM to provide feedback to IAMT where there is an issue with delivering products to specification/
1) BSM to confirm that ICL Pathway can and has delivered the product to outlet.

Both points above are outside the scope of the PIP Stakeholder role.

Point 1) has been included in 8.1.4.

Point 2) ICL Pathway say this information can only be provided retrospectively at SLA level, i.e. they confirm % delivery against
Day B,C, D targets. ICL Pathway cannot confirm delivery of specific reference data to a specific outlet. Positive confirmation of
delivery (as opposed to data from polling failure reports) is a valuable measure for PON, but is still under discussion with ICL
Pathway and must not be included in this version of the SLA.

There is no real time monitoring of AP change volumes through the delivery channel due the constraint of business processes.
There is an operational agreement between the OSG AP team (Gill Payne) and BSM Change Control to provide us with the final
CTO pack once a month. From this information BSM Change Control can calculate the number of changes passed to ICL Pathway
and update our rolling year profile. BGM Change Control is using historical information as a basis for forecasting future volumes
in this area.

9. ANNEXE B - IAM/ BSM REVIEW MEETING - TERMS OF REFERENCE

1 Introduction

The purpose of the IAM / BSM Review Meeting (IBRM) is to review the performance
of the service provided by BSM for IAM.

The forum consists of representatives from the two organisations.

2 Scope

The IBRM will act as the review body for all services provided by BSM for IAM, as
detailed in the Service Level Agreement between the two organisations. It will focus
on the achievement of the joint objectives of the organisations, and will review both
the performance of the supplier, and where the process is dependent on input from
the customer, it will review customer performance. It will also take a view on the
effectiveness of the support received from the business, and address any issues
preventing service operation by normal processes.

The scope of work covers a variety of services within BSM and IAM. It is important
that this body does not duplicate work reviewed by other Service Review groups
within the Horizon Service Review Framework.

2.1 Subjects to be reviewed
The main areas of business on which the IBRM will focus the review are described in
section 2 of the SLA.

2.2 Associated policies and processes

The Terms of Reference have been developed in line with the policies and processes
of the Post Office Management Model and with Service Management Framework
Service Review documentation.

3 Meeting process

3.1 I Members

The core members are:

IAM - Process and Planning Manager

BSM - Head of Operational Performance

BSM - Meeting Secretary

Other attendees will be invited as and when required.

It is important that all representatives are suitably empowered to speak for and act
on behalf of their respective domains.

If a member can not attend a meeting, it is the responsibility of the member to
appoint a suitable substitute to take their place.

3.6 Frequency of Meeting
For the duration of the trial of the SLA the meeting will be held monthly.
Subsequent to the trial the meeting will be held quarterly

4 Escalation and Referral

4.1 Escalation
Escalation from the IBRM will be decided on a case by case basis, to the manager or
body considered to have authority over the issue in question.

Where agreement cannot be reached, the escalation route will be via the Head of
Internal Account Management and the Head of Business Service Management to the
Director of Customer and Network Specification and the Director of Operations.

Escalation should be considered to be an exceptional resort, and the reasons for
resorting to escalation should be examined for each occurrence. Escalation to a

higher level will normally occur either:

« When an issue is causing increased concern through time delay and consequent
business impact, or

e When it has not been possible to reach agreement on some aspect of the definition,
management or resolution of the issue.

4.2 Referral
The IBRM will refer to the appropriate body issues that are outside its scope.
