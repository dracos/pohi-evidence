1. INTRODUCTION

Lt Purpose

This Security Functional Specification (SFS) defines the security
functionality that will be incorporated into the ICL Pathway system. It is
primarily concerned with the technical features rather than the
surrounding management or operational controls (defined in
[SECPRO]).

Ls

BS 7799, “A Code of Practice for Information Security Management’, is
primarily concerned with management and operational controls. It will
be used as the basis of ICL Pathway’s Security Procedures [SECPRO] to
define the controls used throughout ICL Pathway.

Scope

This Security Functional Specification (SFS) identifies the technical
controls that will be used to implement the security functionality within
the ICL Pathway system [SADD].

The (logical and physical) environment to be protected is defined in the
Technical Environment Description [TED].

Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components have been used as the
primary building blocks throughout ICL Pathway’s solution. This will
reduce the need for bespoke code and enable the suppliers’ standard
product documentation to be used.

An overview of the security functionality, provided by the security
components (identified in section 4), has been included in order to
define the security features and system options that will be used.

Control of access to ICL Pathway’s systems and data will be in
accordance with ICL Pathway’s Access Control Policy [ACCPOL].

ICL Pathwoy’y Security Policy

ICL Pathway’s Security Policy document [SECPOL] encompasses all of
the security requirements specified in ICL Pathway’s agreement with the
Authority. A summary of these security requirements is defined in the
document ICL Pathway Security Objectives [SECOBJ].

By implementing the agreed Security Policy, ICL Pathway will minimise
and control liabilities to itself and the Authorities. The Security Policy
also explains how ICL Pathway will comply with the controls defined in

BS7799.

This Functional Specification forms part of the IT security infrastructure
identified in the Security Policy.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

About thiy Document

This Security Functional Specification (SFS) defines the security
functionality that will be incorporated into the ICL Pathway system. It is
primarily concerned with the technical features rather than the
surrounding management or operational controls.

Security Domeiny

The term “domain” has been used to describe distinct parts of the system
characterised by type(s) of service provided, components used (e.g. NT),
and/or area of responsibility (e.g. DSS/BA). The domains are:

e DSS Service Environment Domain,

e PAS/CMS Service Domain,

¢ POCL Central Systems Domain,

¢ Office Platform Service Domain,

e De La Rue Card Services Domain,

e POCL and POCL Clients Domain,

¢ System Management Service Domain, and
¢ ICL Pathway Corporate Services Domain.

The Benefit Payment Service (BPS) maps onto the DSS Service
Environment, PAS/CMS Service, POCL Central Systems, De La Rue Card
Services and Office Platform Service (OPS) domains.

The DSS Service Environment Domain encompasses all ICL Pathway
related equipment and services located at DSS/BA sites.

The PAS/CMS Service Domain encompases the Payment Authorisation
Service (PAS) and the Card Management System (CMS).

The Office Platform Service Domain encompases the Electronic Point Of
Sale Service (EPOSS), which supports all services, or products, provided
by the counter clerk to the customer. For BPS, EPOSS supports the
Benefit Encashment Service (BES) within the Post Offices.

2.4

The De La Rue Card Services Domain encompasses the production of
cards and Pick Up Notices (PUNs).

The POCL and POCL Clients Domain will contain a variety of hosts
associated with applications running in the OPS Domain.

The System Management Service (SMS) Domain will contain the central
elements of the System Management (SM) and Network Management
System (NMS) facilities.

The ICL Pathway Corporate Services domain will support ICL Pathway’s
own management processes. The domain encompasses the Data
Warehouse and ICL Pathway’s managed services.

Security Componenty

The security enforcing components within the ICL Pathway system are
Windows NT, Dynix operating system (on Sequent platforms), Oracle 7
database products, networking components (including firewalls and
routers) and encryption devices.

Firewalls will be used to protect the ICL Pathway system from
unauthorised access via external networks and other local networks
collocated at ICL sites. Protection will be provided by a combination of
packet filtering functionality within router components and application
level firewalls.

Riposte, which is security relevant, is also security enforcing whenever it
is configured to handle user authentication.

Virus protection facilities will be installed on selected workstations,
primarily within the SMS Domain.

Identification and authentication mechanisms are required to ensure
that all users are uniquely identified, with only authorised users being
granted any access to the system.

This SFS, therefore, defines overall requirements for user identification
and authentication followed by specific consideration of users of NT,
Oracle, Help Desk operators, DSS/BA and POCL staff.

Logical Access Control

This SFS considers the access rights that will need to be supported by
system components and the ability of the system to enforce access
rights.

To provide effective control of system resources, ICL Pathway will
produce a clearly defined Access Control Policy to identify all users who
are authorised to access any part of the system and the access rights that
are to be permitted.

The Access Control Policy will be expressed in terms of roles rather than
named individuals. Users will then be associated with one or more roles
so that all persons are individually accountable for their actions.

In addition to control of access to databases, use of the access controls
supported by Windows NT, Dynix, and Routers has been included.

Audit and Alerwy

The audit and alarm facilities provided by the ICL Pathway system will
be a combination of application level transaction logs and lower level
audit tracks.

The Riposte application provides an ideal basis for logging all
transactions to give a complete picture of actions within the Benefit
Encashment Service and Post Offices Infrastructure Service.

Patrol will be used to manage all Sequent systems and the Oracle
applications that run on Sequent platforms.

Wherever possible, application level auditing will be used. The
notification services provided by the systems management products
(notably Tivoli) will be used wherever appropriate. Low level Windows
NT audit tracks will also be used to provide additional facilities where
application level auditing of system management activities is not
supported.

Crypto Functionality

This SFS describes the cryptographic functionality, within the ICL
Pathway system, used to protect:

¢ data on individual communications links,
¢ individual messages from creation to use (end-to-end), and
e data stored on physically insecure Post Office filestore.

Key management and the special requirements of roll-out are also
covered.

Files transmitted to ICL Pathway over the “CAPS Links” from BA’s CAPS
system to ICL Pathway’s CAPS Access Service, will be integrity protected
using an encrypted trailer comprising fields from the original trailer
(including a set of totals for financial data), file header information (to
verify the file’s origin), and a CAPS generated Cyclic Redundancy Code
for the whole file. These are concatenated, checksummed and encrypted
using Red Pike, implemented in software. The values are
correspondingly verified at the ICL Pathway end of the link.

The “CMS links”, used to transfer card production data to the card
producer, will be protected using Red Pike. All data on these links will be
encrypted for confidentiality and integrity.

ICL Pathway’s inter-campus links, between the Data Centres,

are very high-speed (34Mbps) connections, which gives them a
significant level of inherent security. There is, currently, no suitable
encryption hardware capable of operating at this speed, so particularly
sensitive data will be protected using Red Pike.

DSA signatures will be used to protect the integrity of data on the “POCL
TIP link” in both directions. Verification will entail validation of the
incoming public key certificate against a CA public key. The same end-
to-end integrity protection will be used, where appropriate, to protect
other low volume data such as Post Office reconciliation totals.

The kilostream “POCL HAPS link”, to Farnborough, will be protected
using Rambutan based encryption hardware.

The Host Automated Payments System (HAPS) is an interim solution,
whereby all AP data will be sent to an existing POCL Tandem system
sited at Farnborough. In the future, the ICL Pathway system will
communicate directly with POCL customers (rather than indirectly via
HAPS) using the “POCL links”.

The “SM/SIS links” used, by ICL Outsourcing, for support and system
management, will be protected using Government approved point-to-
point encryption devices employing the Rambutan algorithm.

Links from the ICL Pathway headquarters site to the ICL Pathway
campuses will also use Government approved point-to-point encryption
devices.

The “Post Office links”, from the POCL Central Services Domain to the
Post Offices, will be protected by use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN),
with each member of the VPN community having a different key pair.

The roll-out and key management aspects, particularly for the Post
Office Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) links, will be given
very careful consideration to achieve optimum design.

Message Protection

All message protection will be performed using DSA with a 768 bit
modulus. Each DSA signature requires a cryptographically strong
random initialisation value, known as a K-value.

Standard public key technology will be used, with ICL Pathway’s “PK
certificates” based upon the X.509 standard. PK certificates will contain
the public key, the name of the possessor of the corresponding private
key and an expiry date.

BES payment authorisations will be digitally signed on leaving the
PAS/CMS machine. Signatures will be verified immediately prior to use
by the BES application in individual workstations at the Post Offices.

Automated Payments will be signed in the Post Office for verification by
a central harvester.

Fulestore Encryption Ww Post Officer

Red Pike, incorporated into the Team Crypto product, will be used to
protect information held on hard disks within Post Offices. The NT
workstations installed in Post Offices will not have operable floppy disk
drives (since, if fitted, they will be physically blanked off and disabled in
the BIOS).

Selected files on Post Office workstations and gateway machines will be
automatically encrypted at disk access level to preserve data
confidentiality in the event of the workstation being stolen.

The Post Office Manager (or authorised representative) will be the only
person on site who has the means of unlocking the key to the filestore
encryption.

2.10 Aduvinistrotion of Security

Roles have been broadly defined under three category headings, namely
Operational, Systems Management and Support. The ICL Pathway
Access Control Policy contains a detailed definition of roles and
responsibilities for all personnel who will have any kind of access to the
services provided by ICL Pathway.

Systems management services will be based upon three main products,
namely Tivoli, HP OpenView and Patrol. The services provided will
include:

¢ Software Distribution - using Tivoli Courier,
Event Management- using Tivoli Event Console,
Network Management - using HP OpenView,

¢ Resource Monitoring - using Tivoli Sentry, and
¢ Inventory Management - using Tivoli Inventory.

User management, which is primarily concerned with administration of
user accounts and access controls, will use Riposte and the standard
facilities provided for the Sequent and Windows NT platforms.

Domain Definition

Within this document the term “domain” has been used to describe
distinct parts of the system characterised by:

© type(s) of service provided,
¢ components used (e.g. VME, Oracle, Dynix, NT), and
¢ area of responsibility (e.g. ICL Pathway, BA, POCL).

The domains, which may be geographically distributed, will provide
services that are used within the domain and/or by other domains.

The services offered by several domains combine to provide the end-to-
end services, namely:

e Benefit Payment Service (BPS), and
e Post Offices Infrastructure Service(POIS).

These services are defined in the System Architecture Design Document
[SADD].

As can be seen, the POCL Central Services Domain contains agents for
each service provided at the Post Office counters. These agents provide
the interface between Riposte and host systems.

Transaction Management Service (TMS) Agents will assemble
information from these hosts for distribution. The Correspondence
Servers, which are the central part of the Riposte TMS, will distribute the
information to/from the Riposte journals at the Post Offices.

PAS Agents and CMS Agents access the database on the Sequent
platforms. This interface will contain Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
mechanisms used to interface Dynix with Windows NT.

This domain includes the Key Management System used to generate and
distribute keys within the Central Services Domain and to Post Offices.
All PAS transactions will be “signed” by the PAS/CMS Agents, using the
message protection facilities specified in section 9.

The Central Service Domain spans two sites that are often referred to as
ICL Pathway’s Data Centres or campuses.

The transaction management facilities provided by Riposte, including
the Correspondence Servers and agents, will run on Windows NT
platforms.

The POCL Central Services Domain should not be confused with the
Transaction Management Service (TMS). The POCL Central Services
Domain is limited to the central ICL Pathway sites, whilst TMS is defined

to include the Riposte components that run on PCs within the Post
Offices.

The Order Book Control Service (OBCS) is, commercially, a POCL
service, but data is exchanged over the CAPS/ESNCS link to a DSS ACC.
This can be viewed as the DSS hosting a POCL service.

3.5 The Office Platform Service Doman

The OPS Domain encompasses all Post Office sites as illustrated in figure
3-4. The applications, that will run on Windows NT workstations,
support the:

e Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS),
e Benefit Encashment Service (BES),

¢ Automated Payment Service (APS), and
e Order Book Control Service (OBCS)

BES will incorporate the security mechanisms used to verify the integrity
of messages that are “signed” by PAS, described in section 9.

Reference data, sourced mainly from DSS and POCL, will be distributed
to the target applications in the OPS domain. CRC based integrity checks
and validation procedures will be incorporated.

Cryptographic mechanisms will be used to protect hard disks within the
OPS Domain. Filestore encryption and the associated key management
facilities are described in section 10.

De La Rue Card Services Domain

The De La Rue (DLR) Card Services Domain encompasses the facilities
used for the production of cards and Pick UP Notices (PUNs).

The links between the PAS/CMS Service Domain and the DLR Card
Services Domain will be protected as specified in section 8.

POCL and POCL Clients Domain

The POCL and POCL Clients Domain contains the ICL Pathway system
components that will provide the interface with POCL and POCL Clients
(except DSS).

ICL Pathway will provide the POCL Transaction Information Processing
(TIP) system with records of all transactions at Post Offices. The
associated POCL system, which will shares the TIP link, provides
reference data for the applications.

In the short term, the POCL Automated Payments (AP) system, which
processes payments on behalf of POCL Clients, will use the existing
POCL service (known as HAPS) that runs at the POCL site at
Farnborough. This system will be responsible for forwarding data to
POCL’s AP clients, until it is replaced by direct links from ICL Pathway
to each of the POCL Client systems.

Initially, the domain will contain the ICL Pathway PC(s) and associated
communications components, installed on the Farnborough site, used to
receive files sent from the ICL Pathway campus.

System Management Service Domain

The System Management Service (SMS) Domain will contain the central
elements of the System Management (SM) and Network Management
System (NMS) facilities.

By their very nature SM and NMS are potentially system wide since all
components of the system need to be managed. It is, however, consistent
to include an SMS Domain to identify the centre of control for SM and
NMS.

Figure 4-2 Windows NT Security Componenty

4.2 Operating System Security Functionality

Windows NT is used as the operating system for workstations and most
servers.

ICL Pathway also uses two proprietary operating systems based on
UNIX:

¢ Sequent’s Dynix operating system, and
¢ Sun Microsystems’s Solaris operating system.

4.24 Windows NT Security Functionality

Microsoft's Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server have
security functionality that can be described as ITSEC F-C2 [ITSEC].
Currently, only NT version 3.51, in a specific configuration, has been
formally evaluated and certified.

4.2.11 ICL Pathway will use current stable supported version(s) of
Microsoft's Windows NT products (rather than earlier evaluated
versions).

4.2.2 Dynix Operating Systew

Sequent’s DYNIX/PTX operating system is an enhanced version of UNIX
developed for the Symmetry series of multiprocessing systems.

Sequent Host Central Servers are used to run the principal business
applications and associated Oracle databases.

Sequent Data Warehouse Servers act as a repository for a large amount
of financial and service-related information, which is used principally for

ICL Pathway’s internal business purposes.

4.2.2.1 ICL Pathway will use the current version(s) of DYNIX/PTX.

4.2.3 Solariy Operating Systew

Sun’s Solaris operating system is used on servers in each campus,
running HP OpenView and Cisco Works to manage the Routers, Hubs
and other network equipment.

4.2.34 ICL Pathway will use the current version(s) of Sun’s Solaris operating
system.
4.3 Datobase Management Systems

Oracle V7 is used to support the databases used by the host applications
running on Sequent servers. Oracle products used include the Oracle
Relational Database Management System and SQL*Net.

4.344 ICL Pathway will use current version(s) of Oracle products.

4.4 SeeurlD Tokeny and ACE/Server

SecurID tokens from Security Dynamics are used for identification/
authentication of privileged users, as specified in section 5.1.5.

Appropriate Windows NT workstations will include an ACE/Agent that
is automatically invoked during the authentication process to request a
password and Personal Identification Number (PIN) number from the
user. The PIN proves that the token belongs to the user.

Similar ACE/Agents will be located on Sequent Dynix servers and Sun
Solaris servers.

The ACE/Agent sends the password and PIN, suitably obfuscated, to an
ACE/Server process running within the Authentication Server at the
campus. This verifies the user’s credentials, and returns a yes/no
indication to the ACE/Agent.

45 Network Security

The ICL Pathway solution incorporates five main components for
enforcing network security:

¢ Firewalls (typically Firewall-1),
¢ Routers (Cisco products),

Date: 12/05/99

¢ Post Office link components (VPN and ISDN adapter),
¢ Encryption devices (incorporating Rambutan), and
¢ Cryptographic services incorporating the Red Pike algorithm.

4S Firewolly

Firewalls will be used to protect the ICL Pathway system from:

¢ unauthorised access via external networks, and
¢ other local networks collocated at ICL sites.

Protection will be provided by a combination of packet filtering
functionality within router components and application level firewalls.

Control of access to these components is specified in section 6.7.

4.5.2 Rowtery

The routers used will be standard Cisco products and Access Servers.

Control of access to these components is specified in section 6.6.

4.5.3 Post Office Link Componenty (VPN and ISDN Adapters)

This section considers Post Office links.
Specific security controls include:

e Virtual Private Networks (VPN), across all Post Office links - as
described in section 8.6, and

¢ Call screening for ISDN links - where a list of valid callers is
configured in the central Router and all other calls are rejected.

For call screening (on ISDN links) the list of valid caller information
will be subject to access controls and maintained using Tivoli.

An ISDN adapter will be installed in the gateway workstation at every
Post Office location that uses ISDN.

The interface between Windows NT and the adapter is provided by a
Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS) adapter that is supplied
by EICON. The NDIS adapter provides the following security enforcing
functionality:

¢ it will only call phone numbers that exist in the NDIS configuration
data,

¢ it only passes network traffic at the IP level, and

¢ it protects the NDIS configuration information.

All NDIS configuration data will be stored in the Windows NT Registry.
Windows NT access controls and the filestore encryption (described in
section 9) will protect the files used.

Use of VPN is specified in section 8.6.

4.5.4 Encryptiow Devicey

The encryption devices in ICL Pathway’s solution are types ED6ooRTS
and ED2048R3 supplied by Zergo.

These devices are Certified products (ITSEC) and provide cryptographic
protection using the CESG designed Rambutan crypto-kernel.

Encryption devices will be utilised on Kilostream and Megastream
circuits, where appropriate, to provide link-level encryption.

The use of encryption is specified, on a link by link basis, in section 8.

4.5.5 Red Pike

ICL Pathway will use a CESG approved implementation of Red Pike to
provide the protection of selected links, as described in section 8.

The key management facilities used with Red Pike will be implemented
and used in accordance with CESG policy.

The Team Crypto product, used to protect Post Office filestore, also
incorporates Red Pike, as described in section 10.

4.6 Riposte

Riposte (Retail Integrated Point of Sale Transaction Environment) is a
message oriented middleware product designed to support distributed
branch automation.

Riposte provides a 32-bit OLE based application development
environment for use with Windows NT.

4.6.1 Riposte User Authentication

Within the OPS Domain, Riposte will be configured to provide user
authentication facilities in conjunction with the underlying Windows NT
logon mechanisms. This is particularly useful at Post Office counters
where it is desirable to present an easy to use user interface with
minimal logon overheads.

Riposte will be used to provide the Post Office user logon interface as
specified in section 5.2.3 and [TED].

4.6.2 Riposte Messages

Riposte messages are self-describing, have a unique identity and are
immutable. Message types include:

e transactions,

enquiries and responses,

¢ audit (and monitoring information),
¢ authorisations,

© session context,

¢ application reference data, and

e system configuration data.

Messages can contain as much data as is required to describe:

e Riposte,

e audit information,

© security properties,

© system management information,

¢ system administration information, and
¢ application information.

When messages are created, standard message attributes are added by
Riposte (including date, time, user and a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
code). Only Riposte can create messages and the message store is
protected using Windows NT Access Control Lists.

Riposte Servers use Windows NT services for:
© configuration information - stored in the Windows NT Registry,

¢ error reporting via the Windows NT Event Log, and
¢ performance monitoring.

4.6.3 Riposte Message Servery

A Riposte Message Server is, typically, a Windows NT workstation or NT
Server running the Riposte services.

A Riposte “group” is a domain in which messages are replicated to a set
of message servers, which are uniquely identified by their Node Ids. A
group normally consists of a set of units that are providing a common
service in the same physical location (e.g. a Post Office).

Riposte provides peer-to-peer message replication that increases the
resilience and reliability of the system. When a message is created, it is
first committed in the local message store and then broadcast to all of
the local neighbours. Other Riposte Message Servers, which receive
broadcast messages, store them in local message stores, then forward
them to other local neighbours who have not been sent the message. In
this way, messages are propagated to all members of the group.

Message synchronisation is achieved using “marker” messages that are
exchanged between Message Servers. This allows any messages, which
may be lost or missing from its local message store, to be requested. The
activity, which normally takes place across the LAN, is totally
transparent to Riposte applications.

If a message store is lost, all messages will be recovered from other
members of the group. For a single terminal outlet, a dual disk
configuration is used with fallback to the associated correspondence
servers at the central site to provide secondary backup.

4.6.4 Riposte Correspondence Servery

A Correspondence Server is a Riposte message server that is a member of
more than one group.

Correspondence Servers are used to provide:
© access to central systems,
¢ office backup and recovery, and

¢ distributed group extension.

ICL Pathway Ref: RS/FSP/oo1
Security Functional Version: 4.0

Date: 12/05/99

Riposte Agents will provide a service to a Riposte application or group of
applications. They are also used to provide an interface between Riposte
messaging environments and external systems.

Examples of how the ICL Pathway system uses Riposte Agents include:

¢ provision of the interface with the PAS/CMS database applications,
¢ transaction harvesting, and
¢ Riposte related system management activities.

The Riposte Agents used with Windows NT are multi-threading and use
the NT event logging interfaces. They are configured to run as
background processes that either run on demand or automatically as
system services when the system is booted.

The type of each message defines the action to be taken by the Agent
upon message receipt. The action(s) taken may:

¢ interact with an external system,

¢ retrieve information from the message store,

¢ update internal (volatile) state,

¢ update persistent state in the message store, and
¢ write response message(s).

When Agents are restarted, they will co-ordinate recovery with external
systems and restore their state information. Restart is automated by the
System Management facilities (described in section 11.2). Recovery will
include processing messages that may have arrived when the Agent was
down.

The use of Riposte Agents with POCL Clients, AP host(s) and TIP host(s)
is illustrated in figure 3-4.

4.6.6 Riposte Communicationy

Riposte has a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface that may be called
from any DCE compliant RPC implementation. This enables applications
on other platforms (e.g. UNIX or Sequent’s Dynix) to be integrated.

Riposte communications are based on a connectionless, best-effort
messaging model.

The User Datagram Protocol and Internet Protocol (UDP/IP) are used to
provide high performance communications. The Sockets
implementation of UDP/IP, provided by Windows NT, will be used.

4.6.7 Riposte Desktop

Each Riposte user application:

e runs (Desktop.EXE) on a Windows NT Workstation,

© contains and manages Riposte visual components,

¢ is integrated with RetailBroker, Peripheral, Validate, and TRState,
¢ provides session mobility (with stateless applications), and

e has a modular structure (using DLLs for each application).

The Riposte Desktop System incorporates several Dynamic Link
Libraries (DLL) that are used for:

© transactions and Riposte services (RetailBroker.DLL),
¢ session mobility and logon/logoff (TRState.DLL),
peripheral device handling (Peripheral.DLL), and
input validation (Validate.DLL).

4.7 Viruy Protectiow

This section considers the threat of virus infection and identifies the
components needed to provide an appropriate level of protection.

4.7.4 Threat of Virvy Infection

The threat of virus infection in most parts of the ICL Pathway system is
relatively low since:

¢ Windows NT is used throughout the Office Platform Service Domain,

¢ all PAS/CMS Help Desks use Windows NT platforms running
dedicated client software,

¢ floppy disk drives cannot be used within Post Offices,

e there are no E-mail connections to external systems,

e¢ MS Word documents (that could contain Word macro virus) are not
normally imported,

© operational files transmitted by file transfer contain data rather than
executable code, and

¢ the main processing platforms are Unix based.

¢ executable files introduced for maintenance purposes, and
¢ HTML documents containing user Help information.

4.7.2 Viruy Protect Measurey

Virus protection will rely upon adherence to the security procedures
defined in [SECPRO] and the measures supported by the ICL Pathway
system.

4.7.21 All workstations running Windows 95 will have virus protection
software (e.g. Dr Solomon’s WinGuard) installed.

4.7.2.2 All workstations used to import executable code, destined for any
Windows platform, will have virus protection software installed.

The “import” of executable code will normally be from external
sources (e.g. floppy disk) into the System Management Service
Domain. This will enable virus checked software to be distributed
throughout the ICL Pathway system (e.g. to PCs located in Post
Offices) over the network without requiring the recipient PCs to run
further virus checks.

4.7.2.3 All executable code will be virus checked prior to being imported into
any part of the ICL Pathway system.

4.7.2.4 All files susceptible to macro or related viruses (including HTML
files), for which virus checks are feasible, will be checked for viruses
prior to being imported into any part of the ICL Pathway system, by
whatever route.

4.7.2.5 Anti-virus software will be maintained by installing current upgrades,
as they become available.

4.7.2.6 As an additional safeguard, ICL Pathway will ensure that the ICL
Pathway system has adequate facilities for recovery in the event of a
virus being detected.

Ss. IDENTIFICATION AND
AUTHENTICATION
S51 Identification and Authentication Requirementy

Identification and authentication mechanisms are required to ensure
that all users are uniquely identified, with only authorised users being
granted any access to the system.

Reliable identification and authentication is essential in order to:

¢ provide the basis for access control decisions, and
¢ ensure that all users are individually accountable for their actions.

Authentication is based upon the information received, so the ICL
Pathway system will protect both:

e the collection of authentication data, and
¢ the transmission of authentication data.

Particular attention has been focused upon users situated in any remote
location because these can represent higher risks to the system.

S14 User Identification

Identification is the means by which the user provides their identity to
the system. This can be based upon a combination of what the user
knows (a User Id), what the user possesses (a smart card or other token)
or some biometrics characteristic of the user.

5. All users will be allocated an identifier (User Id) by which they will be
known to the system.

User Ids will be unique within the scope of that part of the system. For
example, the Post Office Manager would set up and maintain the User
Id information for each counter clerk within that Post Office, using
the Riposte application interfaces provided.

5.112 Wherever possible, a User id should be sufficient to trace the identity
of the particular individual who has been authenticated.

FUJ00001293
COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE
ICL Pathway Ref: RS/FSP/oo1
Security Functional Version: 4.0

Date: 12/05/99

In some cases, however, the same User id will be used for infrequent
access by users in particular roles. This will apply, for example, to
POCL Auditors who will be required to authenticate with the Help
Desk before getting a one-shot password.

5.113 The ICL Pathway system will not allow (normal) users to change their
User Id.

The aim is to ensure that “users” remain individually accountable. It
is, however, recognised that for very privileged users this might be
difficult (or unrealistic) for the system to enforce. Procedural rules
and auditing will be used to provide additional controls that support
this objective.

5.11.4 The format of User Ids will depend upon the platform(s) used and the
server used for authentication.

In all cases, the procedures used by ICL Pathway [SECPRO] will
provide guidelines to cover operational aspects, including:

e the allocation of User Ids to individuals,
¢ selective removal of User Ids from the system, and
¢ constraints on re-allocation of User Ids to other personnel.

5.115 The system will distinguish between identification information (User
Ids) and authentication data (including passwords).

5.11.6 The security of the system will not rely upon the secrecy of any User
Id information.

5.1.2 User Authentication

Authentication is concerned with establishing the validity of the user’s
claimed identity. It increases confidence that the claimed identity is the
right one for the user.

5.1.2.1 All users will be authenticated before any access is granted to the ICL
Pathway system.

Human users will, therefore, complete the logon sequence before they
will be able to invoke any other actions.

5.1.2.2 Users will be allowed a predetermined number of attempts to logon,
as specified in [ACCPOL]. After this number is exceeded the user’s
logon facility will be disabled.

Other action taken upon failure to logon will be configurable from the
following options:

© analarm message will be raised,
e logon failure will be recorded in the audit track, and
¢ an application level audit message will be generated.

In all cases the logon failure will be recorded.

5.1.2.3 Following logon failure, the user’s logon facility will be reset by:

© positive action by the system manager, or
© expiry of a timeout period.

The optional timeout facility will only be available within the Office
Platform Service Domain. The configuration of this facility, including
the time between retries, will be specified in [ACCPOL].

5.1.2.4 During logon, the responses provided by the system to the user will be
simple messages reporting success or failure. No reason will be given
in the event of logon failure.

5.1.2.5 On successful logon, the system will display the date and time of the
user’s last successful logon at Post Office outlets and for the PAS/CMS
Help Desk.

5.1.2.6 Within each Post Office, users will not be able to run more than one

counter PC with the same user identity.

A subsequent logon at a second PC will cause Riposte to terminate the
users previous session and transfer use to the new counter position.

5.1.3 Passwords

Human users and system/process users will use passwords. This section
defines the requirements for all passwords, whilst the additional
requirements specified in section 5.1.4 apply only to passwords used by
human users.

5.13.1 The ICL Pathway system is not required to provide automated
generation of passwords.

5.1.3.2 The format of passwords will depend upon the platform(s) used and
the server used for authentication.

Date: 12/05/99

In all cases, the procedures used by ICL Pathway [SECPRO] will
provide guidelines on the use of passwords, including:

¢ the allocation of new passwords,

© appropriate choice of replacement passwords,
the need to avoid disclosure of passwords, and
the frequency and timing of password changes.

5.1.3.3 The system will use volatile memory for operations associated with
password checking. For ICL Pathway specific code, when the checking
is completed all “in clear” password information will be overwritten.

Ideally, all “in clear” password information should be overwritten after
use but the use of COTS products and standard applications may
dictate that this can not be achieved or verified.

5.1.3.4 Passwords will never be visibly displayed by the system.

5.1.3.5 Passwords will not be transmitted “in the clear” to or from any
location outside the central ICL Pathway sites unless they are one-
shot passwords.

5.1.3.6 Passwords will not be transmitted “in the clear” within ICL Pathway
sites unless the link used is entirely within a physically protected area
(e.g. Campus sites).

5.1.3.7 All Routers will be configured in the mode that ensures that password
information is stored in encrypted format.

5.1.3.8 An appropriate one-way algorithm will be used to encrypt passwords
on target systems.

5.1.4 Humaw User Passwords

The requirements specified in this section apply only to passwords used
by human users.

After an initial password has been issued, the choice of passwords will be
the responsibility of individuals.

5.1.4.1 An initial password will be made known to each individual. The
system will mark these initial passwords as expired.

COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE
ICL Pathway Ref: RS/FSP/oo1
Security Functional Version: 4.0

Date: 12/05/99

As this password is known by more than one person, the user is forced
to change the initial password before other options can be selected.
This mechanism will also apply to any passwords reset by a third

party.

5.1.4.2 An appropriate one-way algorithm will be used to encrypt password
information used by human users, before storage or transmission.

By definition, it will not be possible to derive passwords from their
one-way encrypted form (except by the use of massive computing
power over an extensive period).

5.1.4.3 All users will have the ability to change their own password (without
requiring intervention from a supervisor or Post Office Manager).

Password change interfaces are expected to depend upon platform
type (e.g. Dynix and Windows NT will differ) but in all cases the user
will complete the logon sequence before initiating a password change.
The change sequence will also require the old password to be correctly

quoted.

5.1.4.4 The OPS will provide facilities to enable the Post Office Manager to
establish new users and set an initial password for each user in their
Post Office.

5.1.4.5 Ifa user forgets their password the Post Office Manager will be able to

reset the password.

5.1.4.6 For situations where the sole user (e.g. Post Office Manager in a single
counter office) has forgotten his password, a secure backup procedure
will be used.

S15 Use of Tokeny

The ICL Pathway system will only use tokens when the protection
provided by passwords alone is not considered to be sufficient. In
general, token use will be limited to system management personnel and
management operations conducted from or on remote sites, as defined
in [ACCPOL].

5.15.1 Tokens will be allocated to named individuals for their sole use.

In certain circumstances (e.g. fourth line support,) a card may be
“assigned” to an individual for a limited period. In such cases, a full
audit trail of such cards will be retained.

5.15.2 The identity of users who have been issued with tokens will be made
known to the system and the authentication processes will enforce
their use.

5.1.5.3 The system will be capable of selectively revoking the validity of
tokens.

5.1.5.4 Smart tokens will be used in all cases where a password alone is not
considered to be sufficient. The user will be obliged to prove that
he/she posses the token at the time of logon.

Tokens that generate a one-time password, thereby protecting against
password replay, will be used.

5.15.5 Each token will have an associated Personal Identification Number
(PIN) that is used to activate the device, as defined in [ACCPOL].

5.1.5.6 Personnel who are authorised to access the ICL Pathway system from
remote locations will be required to identify themselves using hand
held tokens.

This group will comprise selected system administrators authorised to
use remote access for system management activities.

The Girobank Help Desks are physically treated as data centre
campuses and are not considered to be a remote location.

ICL Pathway Headquarters site (see section 8.10) is categorised as
being a “remote location”. ICL Pathway personnel who require access
to the operational system and/or Data Warehouse will be required to
use tokens.

5.1.5.7 Personnel who are authorised to access the ICL Pathway system using
UNIX root privilege will be required to identify themselves using hand
held tokens.

5.15.8 Personnel who are authorised to access the ICL Pathway system as a
database administrator (DBA) will be required to identify themselves
using hand held tokens.

5.2 Authentication of Windows NT Usery

5.24 Authentication Methody
Windows NT [WINNT] will be used as the base operating system for:

e PAS/CMS Help Desk clients within the PAS/CMS Service Domain,
e platforms within the POCL Central Services Domain,

¢ workstations within the Office Platform Service Domain,

¢ servers within the De La Rue Card Services Domain, and

¢ servers within the POCL and POCL Clients Domain.

The standard Windows NT logon mechanisms (outlined in section 5.2.2)
will be used for users in all domains listed above, except the Office
Platform Service (OPS) Domain. Users in the OPS Domain, which
includes all Post Office staff, will used a simpler interface provided using
Riposte (as described in section 5.2.3).

In both cases:

5.2.1 Information used to authenticate users will be protected by the
authentication mechanisms used.

5.2.1.2 All users will be named individuals with their own password.

All account information associated with Guests will be disabled or,
where possible, removed entirely.

Removal of other generic Windows NT users (namely System and
Administrator) can result in installation problems. These users will,
therefore, be retained for System Management purposes but will be
subject to additional controls, as defined in [ACCPOL[.

5.2.13 The standard Windows NT password algorithms will be used.

5.2.2 Stonderd Windows NT Logow

The Windows NT logon process is illustrated in figure 5-1. For users in
domains (defined in 5.2.1) that use this form of logon:

5.2.2.1 The trusted logon process (as illustrated in figure 5-1) will be used to
authenticate users, based upon their User Id and password.

5.2.2.2 The logon process will be reliably initiated by the user invoking a
trusted communication path (from the user to the system).

Windows NT users will use the combination Ctrl+Alt+Del to invoke
this trusted path.

5.2.2.3 Windows NT will require each user to change their password
periodically. The initial change will be required the first time the user
logs on and subsequently as defined in [ACCPOL].

The exact interval will be configurable and will depend upon the
user's role and location.

5.2.2.4 The Windows NT Account Policy controls will be used to set
parameters, in accordance with [ACCPOL], including:

password expiry period,

minimum password length,

minimum password age (before change),

remember password history (number of passwords per user),

5.2.3 Logow at Post Office Locotiony

To reduce logon overheads and improve operational efficiency, the logon
user interface used throughout the OPS Domain will use Riposte desktop
facilities [TED] rather than the native Windows NT interface.

This does not imply that the Windows NT Registry is not used.
5.2.34 All authorised users will have individual User Ids (allocated by the

Post Office Manager) and passwords that will be held in the Windows
NT Registry for that Post Office.

The logon sequence used is illustrated in figure 5-2. For simplicity,
filestore encryption logic (described in section 10) associated with initial
power up is not shown.

When the Windows NT workstation is powered up, the Windows NT
facility for automatic logon is initiated instead of the normal manual NT
user logon sequence. This will enable a dummy user with username (u1)
and password (p1). The first security check is then forced by automatic
entry into a Post Office Manager’s (POM’s) authentication protocol,
which requires the POM to authenticate using his/her Memory Card and
associated PIN in order to continue the boot up sequence and unlock
encrypted filestore.

5.2.3.2 Facilities that enable the automatic logon to be bypassed, to give
access to a standard Windows NT logon, will be disabled.

In particular, use of the Shift key to escape whilst booting Windows
NT will not be enabled.

On completion of the automatic logon, the Desktop process is entered
automatically. Once the Desktop process has completed loading and
Initialisation, the Desktop will display a User logon form.

This Desktop user logon is integrated with Windows NT. A successful
logon requires the username and a one way hash of the password to be
valid within both Riposte and Windows NT.

Once the Desktop user logon has been completed successfully, the user
can execute applications within the Desktop.

It is important to note that the Desktop process runs within the security
context of user ui. However, the Desktop process does not access files
directly, but acts as a Client to the Riposte service that is running under
a privileged user u3. When the Desktop calls on the Riposte service to
perform a function (such as write a message to the Riposte message
store), the Riposte service will ‘impersonate’ username u2, the Desktop
username (provided by the real user).

Impersonate is an NT term defined in the Microsoft Developer Studio,
Visual C ++ version 4.2 as:

“Impersonation is the ability of a thread to execute in a security context
different from that of the process that owns the thread. Typically, a thread
in a server application impersonates a client. This allows the server thread
to act on behalf of that client to access objects or validate access to its
own objects.”

When the user logs off from the desktop, the desktop logon form is
displayed whilst the desktop remains active in the security context of
username ut. This allows the PO user to subsequently logon without
incurring the (typically 30 second) delay arising from loading the
desktop.

5.3 Authentication of Oracle Usery

Oracle DBMS products [ORACLE] support two methods for user
validation, namely:

¢ authentication by the associated Oracle database, and
¢ authentication by the operating system.

5.344 Oracle will be used to authenticate all database users (e.g. PAS/CMS
Help Desk) in the operational ICL Pathway system.

5.31.2 The Sequent Dynix operating system, which will provide the platform
for Oracle, will be used for authentication of all Operational Support
users (e.g. Security Manager) in the operational ICL Pathway system.

5.34.3 The Card Management Service (CMS) and Payment Authorisation
Service (PAS) will use a Client - Server architecture with the Oracle
DBMS server component running on the Sequent platform.

5.3.1.4 A single “Pathway” user on the corresponding Sequent platform will
own all tables associated with the CMS and PAS.

5.315 Database access from the POCL Central Services Domain is provided
by Riposte Agents running on Windows NT. Each agent will be
associated with a Port (or multiple Ports) on the Sequent machine.

The default TCP port for SQL*Net connects to Sequent. Normal
Oracle id/password/role authentication applies.

5.4.11 Help Desks for CMS and PAS will be client applications running on

Windows NT. Groups of clients (typically 50 to 100) will be connected
to Windows NT based servers that provide the connection to the
Sequent machines.

5.4.1.2 All Help Desk users will be named individuals in a user group
associated with a Database Role.

The roles used (e.g. Manager, Supervisor and Advisor) will be defined
in [ACCPOL].

5.4.1.3 Each Help Desk user will be allocated a User Id and initial password.
This will enable them to connect to the database provided they have a
valid username defined in the database.

These users are permitted to access the database by running an
application (such as Oracle Forms).

5.4.1.4 No specific procedures are required for the Payment Card Help Desk
authenticating to the counter clerk. Authentication will rely on
counter clerk knowledge of correct Payment Card Helpline (PCHL)
behaviour in accordance with the PCHL Process and Procedures
documentation.

5.5 Authentication of DSS/BA Staff

DSS/BA telephone callers will be carefully authenticated prior to
accepting any instruction or advice.

The mechanisms needed to authenticate DSS/BA staff are described in
the respective Help Desk Processes and Procedures Description (PPD).
These PPD documents have been agreed by Horizon representatives.

5.6 Authentication of POCL Staff

Mechanisms will be provided to enable the Post Office Manager to verify
his/her identity when making requests to the appropriate Help Desks.
This will ensure that significant requests, including all changes to the
system, are only accepted from authorised personnel.

The mechanisms needed to authenticate POCL staff are described in the
respective Help Desk Processes and Procedures Description (PPD).
These PPD documents have been agreed by Horizon representatives.

6. LOGICAL ACCESS CONTROL

6.1 Accesy Control Requirementy
There are three aspects to access control:

¢ Authorisation - determining which subjects are entitled to have access
to which objects,

e Access rights - determining the combination of access modes
permitted (e.g. read, write, execute and delete), and

¢ Enforcement - of the access rights.

This Security Functional Specification considers the access rights that
will be supported by system components and the ability of the system to
enforce access rights. The topic of authorisation and assignment of rights
to individuals is addressed in the Access Control Policy [ACCPOL].

6.4.4 Aceesy Control Policy

ICL Pathway’s Access Control Policy [ACCPOL] identifies all users who
are authorised to access any part of the system and the access rights
permitted.

For practical reasons, the Access Control Policy is expressed in terms of
roles rather than named individuals. All users will be associated with one
or more roles so that all persons will be individually accountable for
their actions.

6141 ICL Pathway’s Access Control Policy [ACCPOL] identifies all roles
associated with the system and define the access rights that are to be
granted to each user acting in that role.

6.1.2 Privileges and Roley

Users of the operational ICL Pathway system will carry out their duties in
a variety of roles, including system administrator, database
administrator, help desk advisor, Post Office counter clerk and
maintenance engineer.

Users will require certain privileges in order to perform their allotted
tasks, The privileges associated with each role will, therefore, be
sufficient to allow all tasks associated with that role to be performed
whilst not providing any additional capabilities.

6.1.2.1 ICL Pathway will apply the principle of least privilege when assigning
privileges to roles and users.

6.1.3 Separation of Duty Controly

Separation of duty controls will be based upon Roles as defined in
[ACCPOL].

There will also be administrative and procedural controls defined within
ICL Pathway’s operational procedures.

6.1.4 Two Persow Controly

Two person controls have been considered for system and database
management operations but are not proposed.

6.1.5 Use of Diseretionary Accesy Controly

Discretionary Access Controls (DAC) will be used to provide resource
owners with the ability to specify who can access their resources and the
type of access permitted.

6.1.6 Control of Accesy to Filey and Divectoriey

Access to each file or directory will be controlled by the owner of the
object who will be able to grant access rights to other users or groups of
users. The types of access supported will normally include Read, Write,
Execute and Delete.

6.2 Control of Access to Datobasey

The three main ways of controlling access to the Oracle database
facilities are by:

¢ being selective about the choice of potential users,
¢ ensuring that user authentication is effective, and
e defining profiles that limit the use of system resources.

6.24 Schemas and Usery

Each Oracle database will have a list of schemas that define collections
of schema objects (including tables, views, clusters, and procedures).

Each Oracle database will also have a list of valid database users. These
users are permitted to access the database by running a database
application (such as Oracle Forms, SQL*Plus, a precompiler etc) and
connect to the database using a valid username defined in the database.

When a database user is created, a corresponding schema of the same
name is created for the user. This schema defines the objects that may be
accessed by the user, unless otherwise constrained.

Access rights of a user are determined by the security administrator who
will set up the user’s domain. These parameters will specify:

e whether user authentication information is maintained by the
database or the operating system (see section 5.3),

¢ resource limits, defined in a profile (see section 6.2.3), and

e the privileges and roles (see section6.2.4) that provide the user with
appropriate access to objects needed to perform database operations.

6.2.2 Changing User’y Parametery

A user's security domain can be altered using:

¢ Oracle’s Server Manager, and/or
e the SQL command ALTER USER.

Users are permitted to use these facilities to change their own password
but other operations, which require additional privilege, can only be
performed by the security administrator.

62.3 Profiles

The allocation of resource limits (e.g. CPU time) to individual database
users will be simplified by use of the default profiles. Limits found to be
necessary will be defined as the default wherever possible.

6.2.4 Oracle Privileges and Roles

The Oracle Database Administrator's Guide [ORACLE], which includes a
lengthy section on Privileges and Roles, describes:

¢ system and object privileges,

database roles,

how to grant and revoke privileges and roles,
e how to create, alter, and drop roles, and

¢ how role use can be controlled.

A privilege is a right to execute a particular type of SQL statement or

access to another user's object. It can be granted to users explicitly or
can be granted to a role (as a named group of privileges) that are then
granted to one or more users.

Within the ICL Pathway system all privileges will be associated with
roles rather than being explicitly assigned to individual users. This will
provide more effective management control of both system privileges
and object privileges.

Accesy Controly Supported by Windows NT

The following subsections identify the main access control facilities
provided by Windows NT. For a more detailed explanation, the reader
may refer to the standard Microsoft Windows NT documentation
[WINNT].

The security functionality provided by the base Windows NT products is
sufficient to meet the access control requirements on all NT
Workstations and NT Servers within the ICL Pathway system.

Configuration of Windows NT
Configuring Windows NT platforms to provide secure operation is quite
complex. The underlying mechanisms are sound but the products, as

supplied by Microsoft, have default settings that permit Guest users and
do not adequately constrain access to objects.

Configuring each platform, in accordance with [ACCPOL] (see section
6.1.1), is essential.

Windows NT based platforms will be configured strictly in accordance
with [ACCPOL] prior to roll-out.

Windows NT Accesy Control Listy

Windows NT [WINNT] supports Access Control Lists (ACLs) that
identify the resource access permissions granted to users and groups.

individuals to simplify roll-out and system configuration.

6.3.3 Windows NT Tools Used to Control Accesy

Windows NT supports a number of tools that can be used to control
access to resources (e.g. File Manager and Print Manager).

63.3.1 The ability to access Windows NT tools will be removed on the basis
of roles, in accordance with [ACCPOL], prior to roll-out.

6.3.4 Windows NT File and Directory Accesy

The types of access associated with files and directories have been
outlined, in general terms, in section 6.1.6.

Appendix A explains how each type of access will be interpreted in terms
of Windows NT files and directories.

6.3.5 Windows NT Privileges and Roley

Control of Access to Rovtery

Accesy Methods

Cisco provides four methods of access for controlling routers:

© Console access - using a terminal attached directly to the Router via a
“control port” on the back,

¢ Telnet access - using a Telnet, run over IP, to provide a remote login,

¢ Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) access - using the
SNMP protocol to configure the router and collect information, and

¢ Indirect - using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to download
configuration files from a configuration server.

Console access mode will not be disabled by router configuration. In
normal running, however, the routers will not have consoles attached.

Telnet access will only be permitted in exceptional cases, where more
direct access to the routers is essential, as defined in [ACCPOL].

The Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS+)
will be used to authenticate all telnet users. Their actions will be
audited at the NMS.

SNMP access will be used for remote system management of routers
(as defined in section 1).

Use of TFTP will be controlled.

Privileged Mode Accesy

Provided Console or SNMP mode of access is used (as defined in section
6.6.1) the use of privileged mode access can be controlled, as follows:

COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE
ICL Pathway Ref: RS/FSP/oo1
Security Functional Version: 4.0

Date: 12/05/99

¢ Fora given user (or group of users), non-privileged and privileged
access can be permitted. Non-privileged access allows users to
monitor the Router but not configure the Router. Privileged mode
allows the user to fully configure the Router.

e The access mode is enabled for Console access by setting up two types
of password. The logon password allows non-privileged access to the
Router. The user enters privileged mode by use of the enable
command and an additional password.

¢ With SNMP access different community strings are used to
distinguish between non-privileged and privileged access modes.
Non-privileged access allows a host to send the Router SNMP
get_request and SNMP get_next_request messages. Privileged mode
allows the host to send the Router SNP set_request messages in order
to change the Router’s configuration and operational state.

6.6.2.1 Session Timeout values will be selected to limit the period of time
allowed for operation of a console in privileged mode.

6.6.3 Accesy Listy

The parameters to an Access List allow IP addresses to be specified along
with protocols (ip, udp, tcp and icmp) and port numbers.

6.6.3.1 Access lists will be used to define the actual traffic that will be
permitted or denied through a Router.

6.6.3.2 Only traffic associated with IP addresses that are explicitly defined in
Access Lists will be permitted.

6.6.3.3 Constraints associated with particular port numbers will be defined as
part of the network design.

6.6.3.4 Constraints associated with particular protocols will be defined as part
of the network design.

Access lists can be applied to specific interfaces and they can be used to
filter packets before or after routing decisions are made. The use of input
access lists can prevent specific address spoofing scenarios whereas use
of output access lists only does not.

when the same router is shared.

6.7 Control of Accesy to Firewolly

Firewalls will be used to protect the ICL Pathway system from
unauthorised access via external networks and other local networks
collocated at ICL sites.

6.7.4 Accesy Methods

ICL Pathway firewalls will be managed using Firewall Enterprise Centres,
one at each Data Centre, as described in [ACCPOL]. These reside on Sun
Solaris systems which will provide access controls as specified in section

6.5.2.

6.7.1.1 All access to the firewalls will be via the Enterprise Centre, except for
hardware maintenance.

6.7.1.2 As for routers, firewalls will not have consoles attached, except for
hardware maintenance purposes.

AUDIT AND ALARMS

74 Audit and Alarm Requirementy

The audit and alarm facilities provided by the ICL Pathway system must
satisfy the business level audit and security audit requirements of
“external” auditors (including DSS, POCL, NAO and the Authorities’
Auditors) and ICL Pathway’s “internal” monitoring (including Security
Audit and Fraud Risk Management).

The Audit Trail Functional Specification [AUDFS], which is primarily
concerned with addressing business level audit requirements, specifies
audit trails as three “tracks” (namely DSS, POCL and System
Management) that can be selectively viewed by the appropriate auditors.

7.2 Sources of Audit Eventy

Auditable events will be recorded in application level transaction logs
and lower level audit tracks*. Figure 7-1 illustrates the main sources of
system generated events.

Riposte provides an ideal basis for logging all transactions to give a
complete picture of actions within the Benefit Encashment Service and
Post Offices Infrastructure Service. It will be used within the POCL
Central Services and OPS Domains to provide a complete record of all
transactions.

Applications running on the Sequent servers generate logs of the
business transactions and file transfers. The Oracle databases, used for
CMS/ PAS, associated Help Desk applications, the Data Warehouse and
MIS, have the ability to audit security relevant events that are recorded
in tables.

Patrol will be used to monitor all Sequent systems and the Oracle
applications that run on Sequent platforms. The audit events and alarms
gathered by Patrol will be captured, for recording and analysis, via a
Patrol Tivoli event adapter (as outlined in section 11).

COS Manager will generate the main system level log on the Sequent
servers. All users logging onto Sequent at the operating system level (for
system administration, security management etc) will invoke COS
Manager, which will record their logon and subsequent actions selected
from its menus.

Windows NT can provide essentially the same audit capability for both
workstations and servers. These facilities are powerful but need to be
used with caution to avoid generating vast quantities of low level events,
which are difficult to analyse in a business context. Selective filtering will
be used to reduce the volume of events to be gathered, analysed and
stored.

Tivoli will be used to monitor selected Windows NT logs regularly and
picks up agreed event types for transmission to the Data Centre as Tivoli
events.

Wherever possible, application/middleware level auditing will be used.

Low level Windows NT audit tracks will, however, provide appropriate
facilities for auditing system management activity across the system.

7.3 Auditoble Eventy

7341 All events in the following categories will be capable of being audited:

application level),

© system start-up and close down,

¢ change of user rights (including granting of additional privileges),

* write access to selected files,

© system management activities (including addition of new users and
reset of any user’s password).

7.31.2 Where there are multiple mechanisms capable of recording a
particular event, duplication will be avoided and the most appropriate
audit method will be used.

For example, within the OPS Domain, activities at Post Office
counters will be recorded in the TMS journal rather than the lower
level NT event logs. Similarly, within the POCL Central Services
Domain, Tivoli will be used to gather events for central analysis.

7.4 Application Level Audit

7.44 Generel Requirementy

7.441 The principal audit track associated with the DSS track will be the
TMS journal. This will be used to record data traversing between:

e PAS - TMS,

e CMS-TMS,

e BES - TMS, and

e Order Book Control Service (OBCS) - TMS.

7.4.1.2 The audit track will include the following:

¢ file receipt from/despatch to CAPS, including file sequence
numbers and record control totals,

¢ file receipt from/despatch to PAS/CMS, including file sequence
numbers and record control totals,

¢ control checkpoints and any restarts during file transfer operations
between CAPS and PAS/CMS,

e userid, date and time,

¢ all systems access, and

all exception conditions (e.g. file sequence or control total failures).

7.42 Audit ot the CAPS Interface

7.4.2.1 The audit track of transfers between CAPS and the File Reception
system will be held at the CAPS site of operation with a copy
transferred to ICL Pathway (at the site of PAS/CMS operation). All
other audit track data for BPS will be held at the PAS/CMS site.

7.4.2.2 For file based data transfers, the audit track will record:

* all transfers of files at entry and exit to BPS,
e all transfers between subsystems of the BPS, and
the processing of files.

7.4.2.3 Transactions recorded in the BPS audit track will identify the
auditable event itself, date and time, and the cause, effect and owning
organisation or individual, as appropriate.

7.4.2.4. The audit track will allow activities that utilise more than one of the
services to be traced from start to finish, or from an intermediate
point in any direction.

7.4.2.5 The audit track will provide information to allow the original
transaction to be recreated.

7.4.2.6 ICL Pathway will provide BA/POCL with access to the BPS audit trail
and facilities for its secure interrogation, in accordance with
[AUDPOL]. All accesses and retrievals will be conducted by ICL
Pathway at BA/POCL request.

It is anticipated that a suite of standard reports will emerge over a
period of time reflecting the retrieval requirements of BA/POCL
auditors.

TAB Audit Tracky within the Datohase

Audit information, directly related to actions upon the database, will be
held in a table within the Oracle database.

7.4.31 As payment authorisation data is transferred from PAS to TMS, the
transaction log database within PAS will be updated and new
authorisation records will be created within TMS.

7.4.3.2 When encashment or expiry transactions are transferred from TMS to
PAS, the PAS transaction log database will be updated.

transactions handled in these sub-services will also be recorded in the
transaction log.

7.4.3.4 Within PAS each individual payment authorisation will be logged in
the database to support transaction level audit and reconciliation.

TA4 Riposte Transactiow Log

All transactions that pass through TMS will be recorded in the journal.
The journal will be maintained on magnetic media within TMS for a
period of (typically) 90 days. Following this, the journal data will be
archived to long term storage. The current or archived TMS journals can
be accessed to provide an audit track of all TMS transactions.

7441 For transactional-based data transfers, logging will be provided at the
message level.

7.4.4.2 All data captured at a Post Office counter, either as part of a counter
transaction (i.e. BA payment, Stamp sale) or as an administration
function (user log-on, teller balance), will form part of a unique
transaction that is given a unique reference number by Riposte.

7.4.4.3 The format of this journal entry will vary according to the transaction
type, [TED] but will typically contain:

© Post Office ID,
¢ Counter Position ID,
e Unique Transaction ID,

e Date,
e Time,
e User ID,

e Application, and
e Transaction Details.

7.4.4.4 Each counter PC will contain a journal and all journal entries will be
automatically replicated to all other members of the workgroup. This
will include remote Correspondence Servers that form part of the
TMS.

7.4.4.5 This Correspondence Server will in turn replicate all its transactions to
other Correspondence Servers located on different sites.

transactions will make appropriate audit track entries.

7.4.53 The distributed nature of the ICL Pathway TMS will enable an audit
track to be maintained and accessed during any recovery of a TMS
server.

7S Application Level Audit Analysiy

The tool set used to support audit analysis is expected to evolve as
experience is gained in analysis of the various logs. The basic tools will
include facilities to selectively read:

e TMS journals,

e Tivoli event data,

¢ Oracle database information (e.g. using Oracle forms),

¢ Windows NT event logs (for exceptional investigations), and
¢ any other sources of audit information.

The output generated by these tools will be a combination of standard
reports and ad hoc enquiries.

As the tools develop, the ease of use and format consistency of the
information reported is expected to improve.

7.5L Standard reports will include all exception events (e.g. sequence or
control total failures), plus daily/weekly/monthly control summaries.

7.5.1.2 PAS will produce a full set of operational and audit reports as specified
by the BPS MIS requirements [SADD].

data to CAPS.

These enquiries will use the standard operational Help Desk facilities.

7.5.1.4 The PAS transaction log database and related MIS will be available for
access, subject to appropriate security clearance, by standard tools for
query, reporting and data analysis.

7.6 Protection of Audit Tracks

7-641 The audit track will have a level of security such that it cannot be
altered or deleted.

The journals will be written as append-only files, owned at the system
level and protected by the subsystem’s access control.

7.6.1.2 ICL Pathway will keep copies of vital files, including the audit track, at
the alternate central site or off site. The frequency of transferring
backup copies will be defined in [ACCPOL].

7.7 Audit of Systemy Management Functiony

The Systems Management function will provide the audit track with a
record of operational events, inventory, distribution and remote
operations.

7.7Ad The Systems Management Service will provide a repository for
recording all physical events affecting the platforms that support the
SIS, namely TMS and the OPS.

All these environments operate under Windows NT and will be
managed from the Tivoli SMS server. The Tivoli SMS will provide, in
conjunction with the native Windows NT and messaging middleware
services, a comprehensive facility for trapping, recording and
interrogating audit events relating to the operational status of the
hardware, software and applications running within the SIS.

7.742 The Tivoli notification features and Windows NT auditing will

objects, what type of access in being attempted and whether or not
the attempt was successful.

NT platforms to provide central event management services derived
from the local mechanisms.

The local audit facility will collect audit records from several
components (including Riposte and local applications) in addition to
recording its own NT system events. Tivoli then picks up the NT logs

The encrypted trailer is sent with the file to the CAS components at
each ICL Pathway Campus where it is decrypted and the totals, header
information and CRCs verified to be correct. The Red Pike decryption
is also performed in software.

No protection is provided on files sent from ICL Pathway to BA

8.1.2.4 Rambutan hardware capable of supporting ATM and Frame Relay
communications is not currently available. When such a solution
becomes technically and commercially viable, it will be implemented.

8.1.3 Key Management

8.13.4 The Key Custodian will load the key locally at the Series 39 (VME) end
of the CAPS link and remotely at the Sequent end of the CAPS link.

8.1.3.2 Keys will be stored in a file with file access restricted by use of the
operating system access controls. Read and modify access will be
permitted for the approved custodian with no access permitted for all
other users.

The cryptographic functions on each machine will run in privileged
mode.

8.1.3.3 Key changes will be performed at intervals agreed with the
Contracting Authorities, based on advice from CESG, for integrity
protection.

8.2 CMS Linky

These are the links used to transfer card production data and PUN

All data on CMS links will be encrypted, for confidentiality and integrity,
using Red Pike. This enables ISDN lines to be used rather than dedicated
links.

Protection will be provided at application level using bespoke
development incorporating the Red Pike algorithm.

At the ICL Pathway end, the CMS file will be transferred to a Windows
NT platform where the entire file will be encrypted using Red Pike.
The file will be transmitted to the target CMS, where it will be
decrypted again at application level.

The use of Windows NT platforms at each end of the link allows reuse
of crypto functionality.

Decrypted files at the target CMS will be validated to ensure that only
integrity checked data is used for card and PUN production.

Data transferred from CMS to ICL Pathway will also be protected,
using Red Pike, and validated before use.

Key Management

The Red Pike keys will be installed into the ICL Pathway server and
DLR server.

The keys will be loaded locally by the Key Custodian.

The keys will be loaded locally from diskette at system start-up,
directly into memory. They will not be stored persistently in a disk
file.

The Windows NT platforms used will be located in physically
protected environments.

POCL TIP (and Reference Data) Link

These are the links used to transfer information to/from POCL. They
carry the entirety of POCL’s outlet transaction business and stock data,
plus reference data back to ICL Pathway. There is an explicit Contracting

8.6.1.2 Concealing data from eavesdroppers is not a primary objective of this

protection (unlike other forms of protection that may operate within a
communication session).

8.6.1.3 A specific Post Office will become a member of the VPN community
as a result of the initial key distribution prior to auto-configuration
phase of rollout. A commercial VPN product will be used to support
this,

8.6.1.4 Inbound ISDN calls (PO Outlet to Data Centre), will be validated at
the BT / Energis Interchange prior to onward transmission to the Data
Centres. CLI will not be validated outbound to the Post Office Outlet.

8.6.1.5 Where symmetric encryption is used, it will employ the Red Pike
algorithm.
8.6.1.6 Where asymmetric encryption is used, it will employ either the DSA

algorithm or, if embedded in a bought-in technology, RSA.

8.6.1.7 A Virtual Private Network (VPN) will be established to enable Post
Offices to communicate with the campuses. The VPN members will be
the Post Offices and a set of central VPN servers.

8.6.1.8 Communicating entities will be authenticated as valid members of the
VPN community by mutual cryptographic challenge and response
based on asymmetric keys.

8.6.1.9 As a result of successful mutual authentication, the parties will
establish a shared secret symmetric key for the duration of the
session.

8.6.1.10 Continued authentication will be achieved by using the session key to

encrypt all transmitted data. During a session, all data, both Riposte
and Network, travelling across the link will be encrypted as an added
value consequence of using VPN technology.

8.6.2 Key Management

8.6.2.1 At routine intervals, similar to those used for other key material, the
VPN keys at each Post Office will be replaced by new values.

8.6.2.2 The KMS will deliver replacement VPN keys to the Post Office under
the additional protection of a communication key established with the
help of Diffie-Hellman exchange. This protection is over and above
the incidental encryption afforded by the VPN.

There is no link level protection on these LANs.

Key material that needs to be transferred between Post Office PCs will
be passed either using the Post Office Manager’s Memory Card or via
Riposte messages encrypted under a key carried on the Memory Card.

8.7.4.1 Payment Authorisation and AP messages will have the digital
signature applied on their respective source machine (hence they will
be integrity protected over the LAN).

8.7.2 Key Management

8.7.2.1 The Post Office Manager (or other individual authorised to access the
Memory Cards and the associated PIN) has to be present in order to
successfully start up a workstation at a Post Office, since the card is
the only repository at the Post Office for the filestore encryption key.
To authenticate, the Post Office Manager signs on presenting
credentials. These are held, protected by PIN (containing 64 bits of
entropy) ona read-write Memory Card.

8.7.2.2 Keys will be replaced at a Post Office, by a routine key refreshment
procedure, at intervals agreed with the Contracting Authorities, based
on advice from CESG.

This involves the KMS initiating the same protected Diffie-Hellman
exchange as was done at roll-out, to establish key values used to
protect the new key material. . When required, the POM is alerted to
insert his Memory Card into the Gateway PC to pick up the new key
material, and to move from PC to PC in the Post Office, propagating
the values to the other PCs, where the key material from the Riposte
key distribution messages is also decrypted and installed as
appropriate.

SIS Help Desk and System Management Linky

Overview

In addition to the ICL Pathway inter-campus links (described in section
8.9), there are a number of dedicated links into campuses that need to
be protected. The network configuration is illustrated in [TED].

All links from the ICL Outsourcing sites to the campuses will be
encrypted.

Protection

System modifications (e.g. fault reporting) will be done through SIS. SIS
authentication will, therefore, be strong and proofed against
eavesdropping.

All data will be encrypted for confidentiality and integrity using
bought-in Government approved point-to-point encryption devices
employing the Rambutan algorithm (see section 4.5.3).

System management functions, which could cause changes to security
sensitive data on campus machines forming a serious security threat,
will be protected.

The risks will be considerably reduced by permitting only the
activation of pre-authorised fixing scripts and pre-defined Oracle
Forms. The scripts used will be stored away from the management
workstation.

A combination of integrity protection and the use of one-time passwords
provides the basic mechanisms.

Key Management

The standard key management facilities, provided by the bought-in
devices, will be used.

Overview
There will be dedicated links into the campuses sites from the ICL

Pathway Headquarters.

All links from the ICL Pathway Headquarters site to the campuses will
be encrypted.

The System Support Centre (SSC) and Roll-out Database systems will
have controlled access.

The Fraud Risk Management (FRM) On-line Analytical Processing

access to the respective applications that run on the Management
Information System(MIS).

The SSC and Roll-out Database platforms will use a different LAN
segment from that used by the FRM, OLAP and Oracle Financials.

A router will be used to prevent access between the two LAN
segments. The network configuration is illustrated in [TED].

Links used by ICL Pathway to retrieve Track and Trace data from the
Royal Mail will not be protected. The ISDN dial-up, initiated by ICL
Pathway will be to a dedicated PC at the Royal Mail site at Chesterfield.

Protection

Where government approved hardware devices are purchased, key
material will be provided in whatever standard approved way is
normally recommended for that product.

Keys generated in bulk for use by Layer 7 crypto routines will use
entropy sourced from an entropy generation product using hardware
generation. This product will perform its own randomness assurance
procedures. It is being evaluated by CESG for government approval. In
the meantime, ICL Pathway will provide independent software logic
that will spot check for continuing quality of output, independent of
the product’s own checks.

The entropy will either be directly used as a Red Pike key or will be
passed to approved Layer 7 routines to generate private/public key
pairs.

The variation of Diffie-Hellman that will be used is the Thames Bridge
key management algorithm, which is provided by the government
approved crypto infrastructure in use by ICL Pathway. At a Post office,
Thames Bridge generates its own entropy using approved algorithms.

Smaller quantities of keys for use with the Layer 7 crypto routines will
be generated using the approved Layer 7 key generation functions and
the entropy they supply.

q. MESSAGE PROTECTION

ad Technology

Unless otherwise stated, all message protection will be performed using
DSA with a 768 bit modulus. Each DSA signature requires a
cryptographically strong random initialisation value, known as a K-value.

Entropy for K-values will be generated internally where they are needed
(in the Post Office PC, the KMS or in the Tivoli signing system).

V2 Key Management

9.24 Public Key Technology

Standard simple public key technology will be used, as outlined below.

Under public key technology, protected messages are digitally signed by
a private key and validated using the private key’s matching public key.
Working public keys are distributed either at roll-out or by a KMS in
public key certificates (“PK certificates”) signed by a private key from a
Certification Authority (CA).

The “CA private key” will have a corresponding public key called the “CA
public key”.

4.2.2 Public Key Certificates

ICL Pathway’s “PK certificates” will be based upon the X.509 standard.

9.2.2.1 PK certificates will contain the public key, the name of the possessor
of the corresponding private key, an expiry date and key and
certificate identifying information.

9.2.2.2 The CA private key will be held securely on a PC in a secure room not
connected to the ICL Pathway network.

ensure that they are not expired and that they have not been revoked.
Where relevant, the certificate owner will be checked against the
claimed origin of the data that is signed.

WB BES Payment Authorisationy

9.344 Payment authorisations will be digitally signed on leaving the
PAS/CMS machine. Signatures will be verified immediately prior to
use by the BES application in individual workstations at the Post

Offices.
9.4 Automated Paymenty
9.441 Transactions digitally signed at Post Offices will be signature verified

at the harvesting agent that takes the transaction from the
correspondence servers and transfers it to the AP host. The signature
will not be carried forward into the AP Host database since this would
more than double the size of the database. Direct protection of the
transactions resumes when files containing AP transaction records are
digitally signed prior to transmission over links to POCL AP clients
(see Section 8.5).

For new integrity-critical products, the same overall architecture will still
hold. It entails signing in the Post Office, verifying at the harvester, and
integrity protecting complete files of transactions for validation at the
client-end PC.

9.4.1.2 Post Office private AP signing keys will be replaced at intervals agreed

with the Contracting Authorities, based on advice from CESG, using
the routine key replacement mechanism.

e selected counter application data files as required by the application
providers.

The whole of the swap file will be encrypted prior to the loading of any
externally supplied key material. The key used will be internally
generated by the TeamCrypto product using its own entropy, and will be
different for each boot-up of the PC.

The algorithm used will be Red Pike.

Functi .

None of the NT workstations installed in Post Offices will have operable
floppy disk drives (since, if fitted, they will be physically blanked off and
disabled in the BIOS). The workstations will be rolled out to the sites
with the majority of the software, including the crypto software, pre-
configured in the factory.

The delivered configuration of a particular workstation type (e.g.
gateway or non-gateway) will be the same, whatever Post Office it is
being delivered to.

Protection will be applied after delivery on site.

The Post Office Manager (or authorised representative) will be the only
person on site who has the means of unlocking the key to the filestore
encryption. He/she is not, however, required to be IT literate since the
procedures used will be straightforward and well documented.

In general each workstation will be used by a different counter clerk who
will use other authentication data to sign on to the workstation. Counter
clerks cannot unlock the filestore without assistance from the Post
Office Manager. Typically, a workstation may be left running all day but
counter clerks will sign on and off at more frequent intervals.

10.3 Security Considerations
Some basic security considerations of the solution are:
10.3.1.1 The KMS will be the source of the keys for all files except the swap file,

for which a new key will be dynamically established on each PC on
each boot-up.

10.3.1.2 The product used will be Team Crypto, for which CESG approval is
required.
10.3.1.3 The Post Office Manager sign-on will be used to unlock the filestore

(on power on) so that normal counter clerks can then sign-on to the
workstation.

It is inevitable that, across the large number of Post Offices involved,
some Post Office Managers will forget their password, lose or damage
the token needed to authenticate and unlock the filestore.

10.3.1.4 Means will be provided to enable the filestore to be unlocked securely
by a central authority.

More detail is given in Section 8.7.2.3.

10.3.1.5 It will be possible, at intervals agreed with the Contracting
Authorities, based on advice from CESG, to change the filestore
encryption key.

The Post Office Manager will also be able to change his/her
authentication information (e.g. password or token).

ADMINISTRATION OF SECURITY

Administration of security is largely concerned with management and
operational controls but there are also supporting technical controls that
will be implemented.

System management facilities will preserve the integrity of the system
and contribute towards achieving high system availability. The software
distribution facilities, in particular, will incorporate mechanisms for
integrity protection of all files/modules distributed to end systems.

User management will be distributed because the bulk of the user
population will be managed as small groups local to each Post Office.

Management Roley and Responsibilitiey

ICL Pathway’s Security Policy [SECPOL] contains a definition of
responsibilities for security within ICL Pathway.

The ICL Pathway Access Control Policy [ACCPOL] will contain a
detailed definition of roles and responsibilities for all personnel who will
have any kind of access to the services provided by ICL Pathway.

The following subsections provide a simplistic overview of the
operational, system management and support roles, based upon the
initial pilot system(s).

Operational Roley

The operational roles will comprise the “users” of the system in its
operational state, as follows:

BA (ICL Series 39 system) operations (EDS),

PAS/CMS Help Desk Advisor (ICL Pathway/Girobank),
DLR CMS operations (De La Rue),

Post Office Manager (POCL), and

Post Office Counter Clerks (POCL).

A PAS/CMS Help Desk hierarchy of Manager, Supervisor and Advisor
will be used.

Security Functional Version: 4.0

Date: 12/05/99

The DLR CMS operations personnel, located on De La Rue premises, will
use the output from CMS for the production of cards and generation of
Pick-Up Notices (PUNs).

A distinction will be made between the Post Office Manager and Post
Office Counter Clerks.

11.1.2 Systemy Management Roley

The system management roles will be assigned to personnel who keep
the system running for the “users” in the operational roles. In simple
terms, these are the roles for which ICL Outsourcing will have main
responsibility, as follows:

¢ System Manager (ICL Outsourcing),

e System Operator (ICL Outsourcing),

¢ Database Administrator (ICL Outsourcing/Oracle),

e Network Manager (ICL Outsourcing), and

¢ Encryption Key Custodians (ICL Outsourcing, EDS and DLR).

Encryption key custodians will have responsibility for the use and
safekeeping of encryption keys. These keys will be used to enable the
Rambutan based encryption devices at each site. For simplicity, ICL
Outsourcing will manage all keys used in ICL Pathway’s central Data
Centre site. EDS are expected to manage the keys at the BA end of the
CAPS links and De La Rue will manage the keys used at their Card
Production sites.

11.1.3 Support Roley

The support roles will be primarily concerned with keeping all
equipment operational. These activities, which include monitoring and
exception handling, will be supported (primarily by ICL Outsourcing,) as
follows:

e Support Manager,

¢ Support Engineer,

e Support Help Desk, and
¢ Installation Engineer.

11.2 Systewy Management Componenty

Systems management services will be based upon three main products,
namely:

¢ Tivoli (with Courier, Event Console, Platform and Inventory),
e HP OpenView, and
¢ Patrol.

Tivoli will handle all services on NT systems, software distribution to
UNIX systems and central event management services.

HP OpenView (with Cisco Works) will provide network management
facilities and all services to the router community.

Patrol will be used to manage all Sequent systems and the Oracle
applications that run on Sequent platforms.

11.2.4 Twolt

The Tivoli Management Environment (TME) is a management
environment that will be used to provide application services and
applications for client/server systems management.

Within TME, Tivoli provides applications that support:

¢ deployment management - involving installation, configuration, and
control of all resources,

¢ availability management - involving local monitoring and local
automation, and

¢ centralised event-based operations management - that enables
system-wide monitoring, job scheduling, and system backup.

The foundation of TME is the Tivoli Management Platform (TMP) that
will provide all the common services and integration between TME
applications via an open API.

Softwere Distribution

The task of managing a distributed, multi-platform system requires an
efficient method for distributing, installing and controlling software
throughout the network.

The Tivoli Courier management application will provide the means of
managing and distributing software across a multi-platform network
that includes Unix machines and Windows NT platforms.

The software distribution system will be used to manage end systems
in order to distribute, activate and delete software products.

Tivoli will run within the authentication and access controls specified
in earlier sections of this document.

1.3.1.3 Tivoli Courier will provide a full audit track of all distributions.

This will indicate whether distributions were successful and whether
any failures occurred. The time of successful distributions/failures will
also be included together with identification of the individual who
initiated the distribution.

Pre-requisites for software distribution, to maintain system integrity, are:

* anaming scheme for identifying the product(s) concerned,

e the ability to define a software product in terms of its constituent
files,

¢ scripts to perform the installation (and removal) of the product,

¢ criteria by which it can be asserted that a software product is
installed,

¢ aclear definition of the managed system(s), and

¢ identification of the managed network routes to the system(s).

This supporting infrastructure will also provide:

¢ ascheduling infrastructure enabling operations to be executed at a
defined time, and

© a reporting infrastructure to inform the central systems of the
outcome of operations.

The four stages in the release management process, which includes
package distribution, are illustrated in figure -3.

Tivoli Courier will provide the ability to run programs:

¢ before or after distributing new software,
¢ immediately (when Commit is specified), or
¢ after removing old software.

These features will be used to provide efficient and reliable installation
of new software releases.

Event Management

Event Management is the ability to take events from one or more
sources, use defined rules to establish whether local actions need to be
taken and/or whether notification is to be forwarded to central event
servers. Sources of such events will include applications and the
operating systems.

Wherever possible, existing technology for handling events will be
used, with the events mapped into a normalised form for handling by
the central event manager.

The event logs used by Windows NT will be integrated with the
system management components.

Network components, which emit events as Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) traps, will be integrated with the
system management components.

Network Management

Network management will be run from a central service providing
facilities for:

¢ reporting and diagnosing network events,

¢ consolidating and interrogating statistics, and

¢ controlling the configuration and parameter settings on network
devices.

The global system will be divided into three levels for network
management purposes:

1. The backbone network - comprising the LAN hubs and LAN
attachments at the ICL Pathway central sites, the links between the
ICL Pathway sites, links to DSS and POCL, with associated routers.

2. The branch ISDN network - terminated at the central routers and at
the gateway PC at each outlet.

3. The office LAN at each outlet - comprising the PC LAN attachments
and local Ethernet hub (present where three or more PCs are
installed).

Management of the underlying ISDN switched circuit network will be
provided by British Telecom. It is envisaged that the implementation of
Network Management will include interfacing to the Network service
supplier to obtain a structured data feed regarding the state of the whole
network including ISDN.

The network management facilities will be based primarily upon the use
of SNMP mechanisms, with additional facilities provided across the
ISDN network at platform level via the Microsoft NT event system and
associated middleware.

Resource Monitoring

The resource monitoring facilities will be used to establish criteria for
monitoring an individual resource.

When resource monitoring criteria are met, they will trigger pre-
defined local action and/or generate an event.

and hardware inventory.

1.3.5.2 A central repository will hold persistent records identifying the
software products installed on each managed node.

1.3.5.3 The data recorded will be obtained by evaluating the software
signature for each software product on the managed nodes.

1.3.5.4 The central repository will hold persistent records identifying the
hardware associated with individual managed nodes and its attached
peripherals.

1.3.5.5 Where appropriate, asset numbers will be held for the individual
components.

11.4 User Management

The user management facilities provided by Riposte, and its associated
applications, will be used to manage all Post Office users within the OPS
Domain. For all other users, facilities provided by the standard COTS
products will be used for administration tasks.

41.4.4 Administration of User Accounty

The majority of users will be Post Office staff within the Office Platform
Service Domain.

Each Post Office Manager will manage the small group of Post Office
Counter Clerks within his Post Office as a local community. The
interface used will be provided by Riposte that will map to the
underlying Windows NT functions.

Within the central sites, ICL Pathway’s system administrators will be

responsible for managing user accounts on the Sequent (Dynix) and
Windows NT platforms using the standard facilities.
