Thanks all,
I'll check RMF stack again tomorrow but nothing other than this PEAK in their currently.
I'll authorise PEAK 164429 for T86 but would like to move this forward sooner rather than later so test and deploy as
early as possible in October.

      I note that Mik has replied, and yes this one has become a higher priority with the customer.
      It's not related to PC147179, which I've actually just returned 'no fault in product', so doesn't exist anymore

      Gerald has requested a target of T86 as he has gone off on leave until the 23`d Sept.
      Therefore a fix will not be available before the 25th.
      If this is a real problem to anyone please let me know.

      Steve

      All,
      PEAK 164429 (clone of 152376) has arrived in RMF. At the moment this is the only PEAK in RMF.
      I'm not sure why this has been re-visited by Counter-Dev and Gareth as we decided we were not going to fix this
      back in January.
      Has something in live increased the problem or has it beed raised as an issue by the customer or elsewhere? I don't
      know.
      Anyway, CABSProcess is part of LFS COUNTER. I am not expecting any other LFS change during Horizon but it
      might be worth looking at LFS related PEAK 147179.
                                                                                                                                       FUJO0155261
                                                                                                                                     FUJO0155261




We initially said we would fix this next time we visited the LFS code but later updates suggest not. Currently with
EPOSS-DEV targeted at T60.
I don't particularly want to be delivering anything into Horizon that can be avoided but if an LFS drop is required it
could be done in parallel with other activities.

Comments welcome.

Didn't have the option to reopen call so have simply taken a clone. Call PCO164429 is therefore now with Gerald.

Gerald,
Can you liaise with Dave Seddon / Lionel to get this re-opened and then back to RMF?
Thanks
Steve

Roy,

As requested yesterday, I've had a look at the relevant code and a chat with Gerald and I'm satisfied that the fix that
Gerald has proposed for this peak is low risk and should remove this particular cause of timeouts.

The actual Peak is now closed, so I'm not sure exactly what process should be followed, but effectively what I think
we need is for the peak to be re-opened and sent to RMF for further consideration in light of recent investigations.

Are you and Steve able to progress it from here?

Regards
