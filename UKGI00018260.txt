Horizon claims Simon Baker

w

POL has received various claims from

subpostmasters (SPMs) alleging wrongful
termination of contract and/or damages
based on alleged defects in the Horizon
system and POL’s internal processes.

These allegations were initially made in 5
claims brought through the SPMs' solicitors,
Shoosmiths. Shoosmiths is not currently
progressing these claims through the courts.

Similar allegations are also being made
through SPMs’ MPs, and in defences to
court proceedings brought by POL to
recover debts from SPMs.

MPs, Second

Following consultation wi
Sight Support Services Ltd (an
independent investigator) is reviewing
various cases where SPMs allege that
Horizon caused losses in their branches.

POL has also reached an agreement with
Second Sight and Justice For
Subpostmasters Alliance (an organisation
“established to raise awareness of the
issues within the Post Office Horizon
system”) whereby individual
subpostmasters could raise concerns with
Horizon within a “no blame” framework,
provided such claims were brought by
28.02.13.

Second Sight is investigating these
concerns with JFSA. POL is cooperating
with Second Sight’s investigation by
providing background data and
explanations to discrete issues raised.
