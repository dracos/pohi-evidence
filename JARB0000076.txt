Subject: Phone call with James tomorrow

Alan,

Sorry this is slightly late in the day. James would be pleased to speak to you
tomorrow, Thursday 9 January, at 15.45. He'll call you and we have both numbers.

If anything urgent comes up which means we have to reschedule, I'll let you know
asap.

Kind regards
Janet

called JKW and asked for confidential chat with JNA. Says mediation scheme is running, but PO
putting some pressure on Second Sight (vague about quite what) and Ron Warmington getting to the
stage where he is thinking of walking out. Wants to talk to JNA and just brief him on background.
