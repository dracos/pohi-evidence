I am the person named above and am currently employed by Post Office Ltd as a Field Support Officer. Part of
my duty is to visit Post Office Branches and reconcile the figures in the Post Office accounts with the physical

cash, stock and paid vouchers actually on hand in order to establish that there is no loss of Post Office funds.

At 08.30 hrs on 30 March 2011 I attended Rowlands Castle Post Office with my colleague Mr Adam Shaw and
introduced ourselves to the postmaster Mrs Lynette Hutchings and advised her that we were there to conduct

an audit. Mr Shaw and I proceeded with the audit and Mrs Hutchings was present throughout.

The audit identified an overall deficit in the accounts of £9,743.76.
