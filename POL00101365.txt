Hi Paula

v

I had a long discussion with the editor of the programme which made the error: she apologised and we
discussed how to handle -_her offer was for us to provide a full briefing on the issue when it suits us
rather than broadcast a clarification. This feels like a good result for us - I wasn't really keen on a
clarification as it risks further attention on the SS report

(robustly) correct the impression he is creating and we are talking also to BBC newsgathering. I've had a
huddle with Chris and the lawyers and we hold that in our back pocket as a potential action if coverage
doesn't change.
