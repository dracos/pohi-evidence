96/9. MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING

The Minutes of the meeting held on 17 January 1996
were. approved for signature as a correct record.

This was after a minor change: "POCL/BA" in the
first line of the second paragraph of Minute 96/4
should be changed to "ORACLE”.

96/10 MATTERS ARISING

Mr Todd referred to his meeting with Mr Dykes of
the Post Office, which was principally about ICL
matters but in which Mr Dykes expressed concern
over the financial structure and the reliance on
Escher. Mr Todd had referred to discussions
concerning an

European Development Centre in the UK/Europe and
this had reassured Mr Dykes. Similarly, Mr Banks
had mét Mr Dykes who had referred to the Post
Office’s concerns about timescales and the Pathway
financial structure - which was seen as an ‘A’
risk.

96/11 MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REPORT

The report was noted. Mr Bennett said it seemed
certain the ITT would be issued by 29 February
although the preparatory negotiations would be by
no means completed. On the competitive side, IBM
were generally perceived in the strongest position
at present. They had been more forthcoming to
POCL/BA on guarantees than the other bidders and
had no perceived "supply side“ issues such as
Escher. Cardlink were suffering poor publicity
over NIRS II.

minutes/Grp.210296 Page 1
FUJ00077838
FUJ00077838

96/12 FINANCIAL DIRECTOR'S REPORT

The report was noted. Mr Oppenheim reported that
the contract. negotiating teams had made significant
progress, although there was a long way to go to
finalise many of the schedules which would come out
with the ITT. The principal concerns. were over
guarantees, and the risks including fraud
liability.

96/13 PROGRAMME STATUS REVIEW

Mr Todd said he. felt that Pathway was proposing the
solution that the customers wanted. A way had to
be found between the subcontract issues e.g. over
Escher and the customer’s demands, for example on
guarantees and the supplier’s acceptance of risk.
When sensible relationships were worked out with
sub. contractors and sensible terms and conditions
achieved, it would be necessary to work through the
implications of these back to the Pathway
structure.

Mr Bennett said that on the programme status
Pathway felt there was a mismatch on the view of
the achievable timescale (of as much as six months)
between Pathway and the customer.

(Sir Michael Butler joined the meeting.)
“96/14 RISK REGISTER

It was noted Pathway were perceived as having 2 ‘A’
risks - on guarantees and fraud liability and. 8
'Bl' risks. Satisfactory progress would be
necessary by the contract negotiating team by the
end of the next weekend, on the major risks i.e.
prior to the issue of the ITT.

96/15 DATR OF NEXT MEETING

The next meeting would be fixed following
Shareholder discussion on the future.

Managing Director’s Report

Board Meeting - 15th March, 1996

1. INTRODUCTION

All our attention is currently going on the ITT and our Tender
Reply. The ITT document itself is large, getting on for 2,000
pages and shows all the signs of having been put together ina
hurry. There are significant changes since we last saw it
covering:

(a) ‘the contracting authorities obligations.

(b) the status of the service providers solutions with regard to
the requirements, and

(c) ‘new terms for transfer of fraud liability.
The reply date is the 21st March, one day less than three weeks.
2. TENDER RESPONSE

A full review of the ITT has been carried out, checking for new
areas of cost or risk. This has triggered off a substantial
amount of clarification requests on the programme, together with
proposals for them to reinstate more of their own obligations. I
have also told Andrew Stott that there are important issues in the
ITT which Pathway cannot meet or cannot accept. The lack of an
achieveable timetable for delivery is. the most significant. He
knows that we therefore cannot submit a fully compliant tender but
that we do intend to submit a strong variant bid which is
consistent with all the offers and proposals we have made to date.
This is a high risk strategy since legally they could refuse to
consider a variant bid unless there is a baseline compliant bid on
the table. We are taking more advice on this and the BA/POCL
Programme have taken note of our position. I expect more
development on this front before submission date arrives.

3. BUSINESS CASE

The result of all the changes discovered through the ITT scrutiny
has allowed us to update the business model and also carry out
sensitivity analyses. Three key areas are a better judgement on
fraud levels, how to build the performance penalties into the case
and a clearer judgement on steady state period for inflation
estimates. All this will allow the scorecard and the service
point calculations to be established which in turn drive the IRR
and return on equity calculations for final sign off.

FUJ00077838

On’ an important aréa for resolution in the business case is the
final constructs of the sub-contracts and these are likely to stay
on the critical path for reasons listed below.

4. PATHWAY SUB-CONTRACTS

Considerable work is going on to tie all our major sub-contracts
down to Heads of Agreement or Provisional Contracts. This is
taking an enormous amount of effort. Those worthy of commentary
are as follows:

(a) Ora¢lé quite late on have found the concept of PFI. -
increasingly difficult and impossible to get through their US
colleagues. They have therefore shifted their approach from
a risk taking attitude to one of a time and materials
contract. This is far from what was required.

(b) Girobank have just declared that they are now unable to take
the sub-contract for computer operations which was to manage
the PMS and CMS systems on behalf of Pathway. This is a very
late decision and has caused considerable effort with CFM to
see if a substitute contract can be constructed in time.

This work continues are present.

(c) On Escher the néw Teaming Agreement has been drafted and
considerable work and time spent in negotiating both with
Escher and with An Post. It is in a final form at the moment
but has not yet been signed. It would cover the
establishment of the EDSC in Feltham and make provision for
access to source code.

5. COMPETITION

The feedback from discussions around the. edges of the IBM camp
suggest that they have also had severe concerns about the ITT and
are likely. to propose a strong variant bid with a delivery
timetable ‘perhaps even more extended than ours. It is not clear
whether they will also input a compliant bid to be legally safe.
The position with Cardlink is that they are known to have a lot
more risks left than either IBM or ourselves but also they have
the track. record of committing to unachievable timescales and then
seeing how to unpick them later. They could on the face of it be
the only bidder to offer a fully compliant bid.

6. PARTNERSHIP DISCUSSIONS

A final meeting with Bob People and Paul Rich took place which was
more like an interview than a discussion but was an attempt to
discover whether there was a cultural fit between Post Office
Counters and the service providers. I told them that there was a
major gulf between the demands of this as a PFI contract and their
wish to work in partnership with the service provider.
