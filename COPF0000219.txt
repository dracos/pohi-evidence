Mr Daily,

Thank you for your report. It would be appear that something has gone awry
with the submission of the report. The transcript of the interview of Stewart that
the report says should be at pages 17-71 is not there, nor is the transcript of El
Kasaby at pages 16-20. In addition the pagination is perhaps not what you
expect as, for example, page 17 is part way through the list of productions.
Please submit all statements and productions. I would prefer to receive these
items electronically at this stage, but if this is not possible, please send them to
me hard copy at the Procurator Fiscal's Office, Love Street, Paisley.

It may be that you have already tried to submit an analysis of evidence section
and it has failed to send. If so, please resubmit it. This is a section of the report
that lists all the witnesses one by one and gives a summary of what they can
evidence and whether they can identify the accused.

Thank you in advance

Andy Lazzarin
Procurator Fiscal Depute
