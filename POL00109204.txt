Thank you for your letter of 17 September regarding the concerns Alan has expressed about how
the Working Group meetings are proceeding and attendance at those meetings. For your
information, Post Office General Counsel is the lead PO representative at the meeting and from
time to time takes along members of his team who are involved in the case work, as do Second
Sight.

As you note, the Working Group is independent, and it would be inappropriate for me to intervene
as its proceedings, including who attends, are matters for the Group and the Chair. It is of course
open to Alan to raise any concerns relating to Working Group meetings with the Chair.

Paula Vennelis
