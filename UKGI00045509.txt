Hi Alice hope all is well. It is good to see the note from Linklaters on Sparrow. I feel better with a
belt and braces approach.

As I am coming off the Board at the end of the month, I wondered if you might at some point have a minute
to drop Stephen a line with any thoughts on my performance so it can be factored into my performance
appraisal. Strengths / weaknesses and areas for development are all welcome! I have found it a fantastic
experience and I am very grateful to you for your calm guidance of the Board through some not altogether
straightforward moments.

Best wishes

Susannah
