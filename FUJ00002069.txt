NBX Business Parameters Project: EMV ~ Banking and Retail
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE —D0c Ref: NB/IFS/035

2 Introduction

This document lists the Network Banking Service business parameters held in the NBX Persistent Store.
These parameters are held in a table of parameters that control the operation of the NBX Authorisation
Agents for CAPO, LINK and Alliance & Leicester.

For clarity of presentation, the NBX business parameters have been divided into a number of separate
categories.

2.1 Scope

This document lists those business parameters in the NBX Persistent Store (NPS) that are subject to some
level of change control between Post Office Ltd. and Fujitsu Services Ltd. The purpose is to be a single
source of reference for these parameters, visible to those who need to maintain the Network Banking
Service.

It excludes those parameters that Fujitsu Services Ltd. can change without prior consultation with Post
Office Ltd., subject to there being no change in the characteristics of the service contrary to those
contractually agreed and accepted.

2.2 Change Control

The levels of authority to change any of the business parameters in this document comprise the following:

« Operational Change Control
«® Contractual Change Control

2.1.1. Operational Change Control

Fujitsu Services Ltd. or Post Office Ltd. may wish to change a parameter for operational reasons. This
category covers those parameters that Fujitsu Services Ltd. may change with the agreement of Post Office
Ltd., such agreement not being unreasonably withheld by either party. Such parameters are indicated by a
value of ‘Y’ in the ‘OCC’ column in each table.

2.1.2 I Contractual Change Control

This category covers those parameters that may only be changed via formal contractual Change Control
procedures. Changes to these parameters normally involve change to some other aspect of the system,
e.g. an Application Interface Specification or Counter Reference Data. Such parameters are indicated by a
value of ‘N’ in the ‘OCC’ column in each table.

[Note: Rows in the table with no value in the ‘OLA’ column are all Descriptions, i.e. they act as comments.]

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: NB/IFS/035

3 NBX Business Parameters

The general principal is that the parameters table (the TMS_TX_NBX_CONFIGURATION table) in NPS is
for configuration data that would have been reference data on traditional agents.

One specific principle is that configuration via the NPS is at the level of a specific Fl Type (i.e. for CAPO,
LINK or A&L). It does not provide for any lower level of granularity, for example by logical Fl (e.g. CAPO_A
as distinct from CAPO_B) or by NT service name.

Each row in the table is for a specific configuration item, identified by its Parameter_Name, and Applies_To
a specific Fl Type. Rows with any other Applies_To value act as ‘comments’ and provide a description of a
specific configuration item or set of configuration items; by convention, an Applies_To value of
“Description” is used for such rows.

For documentary purposes only, an Applies_To value of “Generic” is used in the following tables for
configuration items that currently have the same value for all Fl Types. However, in the
TMS_TX_NBX_CONFIGURATION table itself there will be one row for each FI Type in order to maintain
the independence of the configuration of each Fl Type.

3.1 Transaction_Type interpretation
This section provides the lookup from the Horizon Txn_Type in the [R1] message into its two components:

« The actual transaction type, interpreted as a 3-letter mnemonic.

e The Customer Verification (or Authentication) Method, interpreted as a 3-letter code.

3.3 Response Codes

The Fl’s Response Code (bitmap ref. 039) returned in the [A1] is a two-character alphanumeric field. This
original Response Code value is returned in the [A3] as the Issuer_Response_Code (<Txn.IssResp:>).

The main Horizon Response_Code (<Txn.RespCd:> returned in the [A3] is mapped from the [A1]'s
Response Code using the following configuration parameters. Most Response Codes are two numeric
digits, and the mapping can be optimised accordingly. However, some Response Code values contain
alphabetic characters.

The second section of the table is for the Horizon Response_Code values to be returned in the [A3] for
NBxX-detected conditions.

The third section identifies the values of the Fl’s Response Code (bitmap ref. 039) returned in an [E2] that
signify ‘success’.

The fourth section identifies those Fl Response Code values that contribute towards the count of
transaction failures that indicate failure of the FI infrastructure.

* This non-capability is pre-S70, determined by <MsgVersion.Major> being 3

3.8 AWK control parameters

Whether the NBX is key change master (for the AWK) is configured with both the Crypto subsystem and
the Agent.

Note that if the key change interval were required to be more frequent than once a day, it will be necessary
to enhance the configuration to allow more than one key check time a day.
