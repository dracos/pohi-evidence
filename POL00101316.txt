To be aware. Just back at desk to this. This has potential to raise the profile significantly - BBC You and Yours is of course
a relatively high profile national outlet. Implications that it has been leaked by someone with some knowledge of media.
Not clear whether accompanying letter also released.

Obviously we’ve only heard about this third hand thanks to good relations at comms level with the Fed: will keep you
updated as it develops. No case at present to update Paula/Board but I will review as necessary.

Hi
Just so you aware. Paul Hook has just called. You & Yours have been in touch re the SSReport.
They wanted NFSP to give details of subpostmasters involved. Paul has of course told them they are unable to do this.

Guess we need to be ready though. This obviously following on from the Look North enquiry.
