Please find attached for your review:

e Updated CRR response (+ comparison showing the changes)
e A first draft of the settlement analysis for this case.

The Settlement Analysis on this case has been very difficult. There is clearly a material disagreement between POL, SS
and the Applicant however POL's position is that it perceives little or no risk. As such, it is a finely balanced call on
whether this case should or should not be mediated and/or whether or not a small settlement should be offered.

The attached Analysis is therefore very much a "starter for 10" for discussion. I'd be grateful if we could have a call to
discuss this so to sound out the Post Office position. As the Settlement Policy has been withdrawn, we are at present
providing our advice on purely legal / litigation risk grounds (in line with the Linklaters advice). However, we'd be happy to
incorporate on any non-legal factors if required — we just need a bit of guidance on what they may be.

With regard to the draft CRR response — we'd be grateful for any final comments by close today (submission date is
tomorrow).

Kind regards
Andy
