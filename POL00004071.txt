whether there's a copy of the unredacted document
available for your Lordship and the witness.
(Pause).
MR JUSTICE FRASER: Thank you very much.
MS ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD (continued)
Cross-examination by MR GREEN (continued)
MR GREEN: Mrs van den Bogerd, we looked briefly at this
document yesterday.
MR JUSTICE FRASER: Is this 1225?
MR GREEN: It is 1225, my Lord, yes.
If we look on page 2 of 4, at the top of it we will
see there are six bullet points at the top --

AL Yes

Q. -- which were previously redacted and now can be seen.
Do you see those?

AL Yes.

Q. And those are introduced in fact by the bottom paragraph
on the previous page, which is page 1 of 4.
AL Yes.
Q. And that says "Key performance indicators”:
“The programme will track performance against the
following key performance indicators.”
Yes?
A. Yes.
Q. Andwhatwe see there is that the key performance

5

indicators for the programme were reduction of operating
cost by £3 million a year.

AL Yes.

Q. Reduction in net agent debt by £1 million. Reduction in

subpostmaster suspensions asa result of audit short

annuals to a level of 60 per year. Reduction of calls
into NBSC by 25%. Reduction of audit losses of 10k or
over, I think that should be, by 50% and satisfaction
with online training models of 95%.

So it’s fair so say, isn’t it, that one of the key

thrusts of that KPIs is cost saving?

A. Part of it, yes.

Q. And indeed that mirrors what we saw yesterday about the
introduction of Horizon Online?

A. Yes partly, yes

Q. And

A. Sorry, can I just say on this particular one the cost
reduction will comeas if -- so the whole thrust of this
is if we eliminate the errors at the front end then we
won't need to obviously deal with errors at the back end
and that’s obviously what the cost saving is driven
from.

Q. And so you could see when putting the branch support
programme together that it was likely to reduce

subpostmaster suspensions asa result of audit

6

oP,

>

eProPr

shortages, couldn't you?
Yes.
So the measures that you had in mind would be likely to
lead to reduction in those suspensions?
Yes.
And in a reduction of audit losses of £10,000 or more?
Yes
And to greatly increased satisfaction in online training
models?
Yes.
And that reflected a recognition by you of where the
scope for improvement lay after you had carried out sort
of horizon scanning exercise, no pun intended, of the
difficulties that were being encountered by branches?
Yes. As I said yesterday it was across a number of
areas including what was coming through Business as
Usual, what I saw from the mediation scheme and the
branch support programme; all of those.
Thank you. Could you now be shown very kindly (F/1330}..
This is a spreadsheet of call logs that you have
referred to in your witness statement. I will just read
out your witness statement, paragraph 184 (£2/5/42}, to
you while that’s downloading. Under the "NBSC" heading
at paragraph 184:

“In terms of the use of the Helpline and NBSC

7

generally, my colleague, Dean Whitehead, WFM & Telephony
Manager ..”
What's WEM?
Workforce management.
Workforce management and telephony manager:
*.. has prepared the attached spreadsheet which
appears

We can see it is {F/1330}

*.. which includes the NBSC call data volumes from
30 March 2015 to 11 November 2018”

And the aggregated volumes, I understand, were not
tracked prior to March 2015, is that right?
I'mnotsure it wasin this format actually. We always
recorded the number of calls but how they have been
presented has changed.

Let’s just look then -- in the light of that answer
Jet's look at {E2/5/43}, which is what you say at 185.5.
So you say:

“In terms of the period of the available call volume
data, to confirm, while Post Office hold records of the
calls received that predate 30 March 2015 ..”

Because we have seen some in this trial, haven't we?
Yes.

we donot hold in a readily accessible place any

aggregated call volume data from before this date.”

12 A. Yes: 12 You give three POL numbers

1 references that we had to go and read and look at to try
2 and find what you were saying, there's no row or
3 anything like that mentioned, those documents are event
4 data documents, aren't they?
5 A. Sorry -- well, I understood them to be transactions as
6 well
7 Q. Let's havea look and just trace it through. Let’s look
8 at {F/1354] please as an example. This is the second of
9 the POL references in that paragraph. If we could go to
10 sheet 1 rather than the summary please. So this is the
11 event data.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. It’s not the transaction data and it’s not data from
14 which we can see that every transfer out has
15 a corresponding transfer in of the same amount, is it?
16 Do you want to go across to the right a bit?
17 A. Noton this you won't see that, no.

18 MR JUSTICE FRASER: Could you keep your voice up please.
19 A. Sorry, yes.
20 MRGREEN: And it shows receipts printed and things like

21 that, it shows reversals, variance checks, things like
22 that,
23 A. Yes.
24 Q Soyoucan’t actually see that?
25 A. Notfrom this one, no
17
1 Q No. And all three of the specific POL numbers,
2 documents, at paragraph 90 - go back to page 23 of your
3 witness statement {E2/5/23} -- were actually references
4 to events data. Were you aware that this was taken up
5 with your solicitors in February?
6 A. No, I wasn't. Because to look at this I have looked at
7 the event data, as you say, to look at corresponding
8 transfers in and out and then the transaction data to
9 look at the values of those to see from which stock
10 unit, so... sorry, I didn’t put the reference numbers
11 on the document, so
12 Q. Bur the POL number documents that were in the statement
13 that you had in front of you when you were being shown
14 this, I asked you at the beginning did you look at those
15 documents to see whether they could support what you
16 were saying they showed and you said yes.

19 A. SoI understood that to have included the transaction
20 data as well, so that’s my mistake in terms of the

22 Q. Very briefly I will just show you this: (H/186/2}. This
23 is a 4 February 2019 letter and it relates to, at the

paragraph 90, without exhibit
intended document.

Please identify the

“Also at paragraph 90, Mrs van den Bogerd exhibits
transactional data for June to August 2015. We
anticipate that data outside of this range was
identified by Post Office and considered by ... her
small team ... As Post Office must recognise, Mr Latif
may have misremembered the date of the incident”

Go over the page please [H/186/3} and then there's
a reference to data in paragraph 98, checking that, do
you see that?

Sorry, where are we?

Paragraph 11

Yes.

The reference to the POL document: is this the correct
{H/196/18} there's
a response on 11 February and the reference to ARQ data
at the bottom, in paragraph 90 without exhibit says

“The reference to "ARQ data’ is to the transaction
data for the branch which referred to the exhibit

document or not? And if we look at

mentioned in the previous sentence.”
So it specifically asked about is this the

transaction data in these three event data logs and then

that comes back. Were you aware of any of this going on

in the background in relation to whatyou had said in

19

your witness statement?
No. I understood the transaction data was there.
Okay. Because it was actually disclosed on 21 February
and Mr Latif went to Kashmir on 19 February.
Right.
So if we go back to paragraph 90 {E2/5/23}, you will see
that the three additional references underneath at
{F/1353.1}, [F/1365.1} and {F/1371.1j, are additional
documents which are not those POL documents, but you
didn’t know about any of that?
No, sorry, I didn’t know about that.
To find the information about the value of stock
transfers, which was what was in issue
Yes.

weneed to look at the transaction data, don’t we?
Yes, yes.
Pausing there, were you aware that there had been two
quite widespread and persisting bugs which related to
transfers between stock units going awry when you made
your statement? Did anyone tell you that?
At this time?
When you made your statement did you know that within
the Horizon system there had been two quite important
bugs which related to problems with stock unit

transfers, or not?

17 transferred in within the branch. 17 can’t tell from this line what that is, ean you?
18 Q Well, lets look at it quickly if we may. 18 A. Noton this particular line, So what-- so using the
19  MRJUSTICE FRASER: Just before we do I would just like to 19 event data and the transaction data, looking at the
20 understand your last answer. Mr Green was asking you if 20 event data for the record of the transfers in and
21 you had the overlap between Dalmellington bug and 21 transfers out, that would tell you all the transfers in
22 Callendar Square bug in your mind when you signed or 22 and the transfers out that had happened in that
23 prepared your witness statement dealing with Mr Latif 23 particular -- however you wanted to filter it. So,
24 A. Not specifically . 24 for instance -- so we looked at June, July and August.
25 MR JUSTICE FRASER: You didn't, all right. 25 That would filter it, looking then -- going from the
21 23
1 Mr Green, 1 event data then to the transaction log for the

3 Could we look please now at {[F/1365.1}. And can we 3 user to narrow it down.
4 look at sheet 1 please rather than the summary. There 4 Q. Okay. Do youknow what the code 4910isin that line?
5 are 28,890 rows. You didn’t refer to any particular row 5 Do you know what product code that relates to?
6 number in your witness statement because when you made 6 A. Sorry, I would need that list at the side of meto
7 your witness statement you weren't looking at this 7 I’mnot that close to the detail. So there’s a list of
8 document, or weren't referred to this document, which 8 all the product codes and the IDs that we have disclosed
9 hada different POL number. Can you remember roughly 9 and 1 would -- my team would know that off the top of
10 where it was? 10 their head, I would need to work off the sheet.
11. A. Sorry, where what was? 11° Q. You would need to look at the ID list. Wecansee
12 Q Where you were looking. Did you do it by date? 12 what's been disclosed at {F/1292.2}. Those are the
13. A. SoI would have filtered on it by date. 13 product ID lists , aren't they?
14 = Q. Youthink you would have done that? 14 A. Yes.
15 A. Byvalue. 15 And one of the things we notice about the product ID
16 Q Did youhave it in paper form -- 16 lists is they are different lengths, aren’t they?
17 A. Bystock unit. 17 A. Yes.

1 Q. They-vary in length. And some of those product codes
2 are provided by third parties, aren't they, so
3 Post Office is not in control of them?
4 A. Yes. I don't know where they come from.
5 Q. Okay.
6 Let's go back please -- let’s just look, if we may,
7 at your statement at page (E2/5/23}, paragraph 91.2.
8 ‘That was the analysis that you did in your witness
9 statement when you did it in November.

10 A. Yes

11° Q. And you say there

12 “. there were two transfers of £2,000 from the AA
13 stock unit to the SP1 stock unit, both of which were
14 successful .”
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And then you say:
17 “There were 4 separate transfers of £2,000
18 in August 2015 (onthe 1st, 3rd, 5th, 26th) all of which
19 were successfully transferred into stock unit SP1"
20 So that's what you said in
21 A. November.
22 Q. -- November. Then you have had to amend your account of
23 what transactions in fact took place, haven't you?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. So 91.2 should now read that in July 2015 there were two
25

1 transfers of £2,000 "between" instead of “from”, yes?

2 A. Yes.

3 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Weare still in paragraph 90?

4 MRGREEN: We are still in 91.2, my Lord.

5 MRJUSTICE FRASER: 91.2, yes.

6 MRGREEN: Soit is "between" instead of “from” and “and”

7 instead of to” and then after stock unit effectively

8 saying one each way.

9 AL Yes.
10 Q. Both of which were successful, and then 91.3 has also
11 been changed to say that instead of four separate
12 transfers, in total there were five, adding at the end
13 of the sentence “and one on 3 August which was
14 successfully transferred into stock unit AA”
15 A. That's right
16 Q. Thatcorrection reflects the fact that the account that
17 you had previously given wasn't actually right, was it?
18 A. It wasn't as -- it didn’t have as full an explanation as
19 1 have done on my correction, no.
20 Q That's slightly finessing it on the first one, isn't it,
21 because havea look. You say there were two transfers
22 from AA to SP1.
23° A. Yes.
24 Q. Andthat wasn't correct, was it?
25 A. No.

oPoOoP,

It’s not a question of being full or not full, it’s just
wrong, isn’t it?

Which is why I made the correction, yes.

But it is wrong, it’s not a question of full or not
full, is it?

The statement that said that the transactions -- there
were corresponding entries for transfers in and out for
2,000 is right and what! have done in the correction
is, particularly on 91.3, brought in the other one as
well and expanded the other one, yes.
make it clear on there that there was more than I'd put

So 1 wanted to

in my statement.
Well, I understand adding in the fifth one, but just the
very short point is 91.2 was wrong, the statement was
wrong. They weren't two transfers from AA to SP1 at
all, were they? It was one way

And one the other:

~- and one the other?

Yes, that's correct

Right. And you would agree that getting these things
correct would be very important for fairly resolving any
issue about discrepancies raised by an SPM?

Yes, of course.

And whether or not the transaction correction process is

‘countermeasure within the Horizon system,

27

Yes.
as Dr Worden has suggested, you are not suggesting

that this trial is part of the Horizon system and the

countermeasure, are you?

Sorry, can you repeat that?

Dr Worden regards transaction corrections as one of the

countermeasures in the robustness of Horizon.

Yes.

It would beare ridiculous to suggest this trial is

a countermeasure for the robustness of Horizon, so the

things we find out here are wrong and then can be

corrected?

I see, yes, agree.

That's an absurd suggestion, isn’t it?

I agree,

So let's look, if we may please, at the transaction data

(F/1365.1]. And let's look at 21 July

Parenthetically while that is loading, you didn't

itself , which is

actually refer to or exh
ID list, did you, in your statement?
No, I didn’t.

‘That was necessary to try and decipher these

it the product list, product

spreadsheets?
Ye

So that had to be found in the disclosure, yes?

1A. Yes.
2 Q. So having done that let's go please to row 18358 please.
3 Now, is this the row that you think is a relevant row
4 for this, or is it the next one?
5 A. Sorry, relevant for .?
6 Q. Relevant for Mr Latif’s transfers --
7A. The transfers in and out from AA to SP1?
8 Q. Which ones should the court look at?
9 A. So it would be both.
10 Q. Okay, do you know what they are both doing?
11 A. It’s moving the cash out of
12 Q. Which one is moving the cash?
13 A. Sothe first one is 13.54, that’s the first one, and the
14 corresponding one is the second one below it then.
15 Q. Okay.
16 A. So it happens in two stages on this report
17 Q. So when Mr Latif was being cross-examined on this -- and
18 the transcript reference is Day 2/63 lines 1 to 14
19 (Day2/63:1}, we don't need to go there -- it was
20 suggested to him that the transactions either side of
21 these two entries were back office entries that he
22 didn’t need to worry about. Actually, code 1 is cash,
23 isn’t it?
24 A. That's right
25 Q. So that’s an important part of the transaction?
29
1 AL Yes.
2 Q. Butyou would need the product list to know that,
3 wouldn't you?
4 A. Youwould, yes
5 Q. And 6276 meansa transfer in, doesn’t it?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. And 6277 means transfer out?
8 AL Yes.
9 Q Are you just being agreeable, or is that something you

10 know?

11 A. 1 wouldneed ~ well from this, yes, I know that, but as
12 I said earlier, the list is whatI would need

13 Q. If youtake it fromme at the moment.

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. Ushaving found the list, that does appear to be what it
16 says.

17~=A. Yes.

18 Q. And how much of this did you know when you signed your
19 witness statement? Or is this something that you have
20 learned more about since you suggested the corrections
21 in preparing for the trial?

22 A. Soas I said in my witness statement, because of the

23 time to put that together I relied on the team to pull
24 it all together. I had reviewed it but not into this
25 level of absolute detail. So what! have looked at is

30

eIAHkYOnE

A

the list of the product IDs, that list is something that
1 would need to use as I douse -- because I don’t do
the same frequency as my team, is something! would use
and that’s when I have made the corrections to say
actually I need to explain that a bit more, which is why
I made the corrections.

Let’s compare the transaction data with the event data
for a second. Now, if we just look just a little bit
higher up, can you see 6277 in row 18352?

Yes.

6277, with a 1 above it, that's cash anda transfer out,
yes?

Yes.

So this sequence appears to begin at 13.52.17, do you
see that?

Yes.

And Horizon automatically prints out one receipt for

a transfer in and one receipt for a transfer out,

doesn't it?

Yes.

I think you mentioned that at paragraph 88 of your
witness statement.

Yes.

And indeed I think that
but I can take you to a reference of the original design

it’s probably uncontroversial

31

of Horizon, but that’s how it was designed to work from
the outset?

Yes. And witha place to sign on the piece of paper as
well, yes

Can we go please now to the event data at (F/1354},
which was the second of the original POL reference
documents you gave in your witness statement, and let's
look please at row 8528. Doyousee that? "AP branch
receipt"?

Yes.

Yes? And we have then got “Transfer out slip - office

copy’, do you see that?

Yes.
And then at 56134 we've got "AP branch receipt”,
“Transfer in slip - office copy" and “Transfer in slip
office copy”.

Sorry, I have lost you.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Use the row number please.
MR GREEN: Sorry, 8534. Do you see 8534?

A

Q

The one that is highlighted now, yes.

How many transfer in slips do you see printed out there;
one or two?

‘There's one below that as well

Yes. And they are 4 seconds apart, aren't they?

Yes.

1 Did you notice that instead of one transfer in slip, two 1 been previous issues with transfers between stock units,

3 No. I can’t say I did, no. 3 slip being produced? No one pointed that out to you,

4 But this was the event data document to which your 4 did they?

9 I can't recall exactly. 9 Q. Does any of that cause you to wish to think again about
10 Let me show you. Let's look at {£2/11/26} please. This 10 what you have said about Mr Latif’s situation? Does it
11 is in the table annexed to Mr Parker's witness statement 11 worry you at all?

12 and do you see the short name is "Unexplained 12 A. So it is something that I would want to go back and have
13 discrepancies (duplicate remin)"; do you see that? 13 a look at.
14 Under the short name? 14 QI understand.
15 Yes. 15 A. But if we go back to -- so in terms of the data that
16 And there is Mr Coyne’s summary and then if we go to 16 I have looked at, and I have looked at Mr Latif’s data
17 “Response to Mr Coyne”, Fujitsu's comments, if we go 17 in detail, if you go back to anduse the data to look at
18 across to the right, "Financial impact on branch 18 the transfers in and out, look at whatMr Latif has

20 “This issue caused a discrepancy in the 20 he did that himself, that doesn’t show on the data that
21 subpostmaster’s outreach branch which was easy to 21 we've got
22 identify from the transaction logs available through 22 Q. Okay, well, let's look -- on your understanding of it?

1 Yes, I see that. 1 AL Yes.

3 to help you give the court a fair picture in your 3 including data relating to TCs, shows that the branch

4 witness statement? 4 received two TAs on 18 January 2018”

5 Are you referring to the Dalmellington case or to the 5 A. Yes.

7 ‘The fact that there had been two transfer in slips 7 actually to March 2018 data. Did you spot that when you

8 printed 8 were compiling your witness statement?

9 No. 9 A. Sorry, no. I didn’t. The data I looked at was the
10 and the fact that that was what was being said by 10 correct data.

11 a witness in this case to be how you could spot the 11 Q Yes. It has now been hyperlinked. If we follow the

13 Sorry, so the Dalmellington bug I knew was specific to 13 for January 2018 which is the relevant set of data, yes?
14 outreaches. 14 A. Yes, which is the data I looked at

1 people to understand what your theory is?
2 A. Yes, these aren't the easiest things to
3 Q Especially difficult if noone tells you which specific
4 entries they are talking about?
5 A. Yes, agreed.
6 Q. If welook at row 12983 please, Can you see there are
7 four entries there? Are those the entries you had
8 a look at?
9A. Sorry, on 12983?

11 A. Right, yes.
12 Q Are those the ones you had in mind, or can you not
13 really remember?
14 A. It wasthe 25,
15 Q. Yes
16 A. Two 25s booked in.
17° Q. There are two 25s there, aren't there?
18 A. Yes
19 Q. Andtheyare both positive 25s?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q And do you know what the product codes were? Did you
22 look that up?
23 A. Fromthis I can’t recall, but what came in was the
24 seratcheards
25 Q. Okay, well, just to help you, 35341 appears to be £10
37
1 seratcheards?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. 33327 is £3 scratchcards and 5473 is £5 scratchcards
4 A. So the issue was with the £10 ones.
5 Q. Okay, let's look at that and follow it through. You say
6 in your witness statement that two transaction
7 acknowledgements decreased stock when they should have
8 increased stock.
9 A. That's correct.
10 Q Which ones are they?
11 A. 25.
12 Q. And if we could look please at line 35341.

13 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Can you use the row not the product
14 code.
15 MRGREEN: I'mso sorry.

16 Can we just go please to 4 January I think at
17 row 2237. So we've got 2237, 4 January. I just wantto
18 show you how this appears to work. So at 6.55, this is
19 the same code, yes, 35341?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q At 6.55 in the morning you've got minus 20, do you see
22 that?
23° A. Yes.
24 Q. If welook at row 2309, at 8.54 in the morning we've got
25 plus 20, do you see that? 35341

Yes.
So you've got minus 20 followed by plus 20. Let's go to
row 6046. Do yousee that’s 9 January at 6.11 in the
morning? You've got again 35341, you've got minus 25.
Yes.
And then if we go to row 6213, at 9.15, do you see there
you've got plus 25? And the way we found this was by
searching on the code -- it is obviously quicker in
court to go to the specific row numbers, but this is by
searching the code 35341 and tracing through the
entries

So you get a negative entry and then a corresponding
positive one?
Mm-hm.
Yes? And we see it again at row 10202 and there's the
minus 25 and 10331, plus 25.
that pattern to you before you did your witness
statement?

Had anyone pointed out

Not before I did my witness statement.

No. Has anyone pointed it out since?

So what I asked and I have seen is that the two TAs that
came in actually came in with the wrong signage on it,
so it actually came in and it decreased the stock rather
than increasing the stock and that’s why the TC was sent

to correct that

39

Yes, but what I’m asking about first is looking at the
underlying transactions to see what actually happens
first .

Yes.

And trace the transaction through from the beginning,

not just look at the TA.

Yes

Now, it may not be that this is something you know about
or understand and that’s a perfectly reasonable answer
to give to the court. You're not required to answer
questions you don't know.

Yes.

So is this something that you yourself actually know
about, or has it come from other people who aren't here?
So my team are closer to this

I know.

~ but the working -- so the team do the working of it

I have interrogated the information to see if I can see
exactly how that flows and on this whatI can see is
that two lots of scratchcards, £10, came in and they
came in the wrong way and it has actually decreased
instead of increased, therefore they weren't -- they
weren't effectively remmed in, which is what the TA does
now, and when you look at the data you can see that

flowing through and what's happened in branch,

Day 6

1 Q. Well, let's havea look at it, what does actually happen
2 on 18 January and I will suggest something to you and
3 you tell his Lordship whether you can agree or disagree
4 with it
5 Let's look at row 12983. We've got two positive 25s
6 there, do you see that?
7 AL Yes.
8 Q. And if one of the 25s should have been minus 25 he is
9 going to be actually 50short, isn’t he? Because
10 instead of recording the amount of stock he actually
at should have had and cancelling out, he is going to end
12 up with a record which is 50 rather than zero and
13 therefore he is going to be 50 short, do you agree?
14 A. Right. What he had was minus though.
15  Q. Well, he’s got two positive 25s there, hasn’t he?
16 A. Yes
17 Q Hehas not got whatwe have seen elsewhere, minus
18 25/plus 25. So all I'm pointing out to you is on this
19 premise he is going to be 50 short, the different
20 between the 25s cancelling each other out and them both
21 being the same sign, the difference is not 25, it’s 50,
22 isn't it?
23. A. Sorry, when you say 50 short, what do you mean, because
24 he has already got the scratcheards in the branch?

25 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Okay, let me just try and speed this up.

al
1 1 know what your evidence is in totality. What Mr Green
2 is doing is he is taking you through some steps.
3A. Yes.
4 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Now, you might not agree with the steps,
5 which is why he is putting it as a premise, but his most
6 recent question was the other examples he had shown you
7 had a positive 25 anda negative 25 that had an overall
8 effect of zero
9 AL Yes.

10 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Yes? And what he is putting to you

11 here, which is a hypothesis on his case, is that if one

12 of these should have been a minus 25, instead of the two

13 25s having a net effect of zero they would have an

14 effect of 50.

15 A. Okay.

16 MRJUSTICE FRASER: He is going to reput the question

17 because I’m not going to put questions for him, but

18 that’s whathe is trying to do

19° A. AM right
20 MRGREEN: Soif that hypothesis is right, the difference is

21 that it will show an additional 50 of stock compared to
22 what it would have showed had it netted to zero?

23 A. [think so, yes.

24 Q Andhewould then not have the artificially inflated

25 stock on this premise?

42

eIAHkYOnE

>

orere>

orerer

OPO,

Yes.
And so he would be 50 short. Real life

Yes

-- would fall short by 50?

Yes.

And he would then regard himself as due a transaction
correction for 50 cards rather than for any other
number, yes?

For 50 cards?

Yes.

Yes.

On that premise?

Yes.

And in the event that he reverses a transaction for 50
cards, his cards should go down by 50?

Yes.

But his cash should go up by 50 correspondingly?

Yes.

And so he would want, in fairness, a transaction
correction to increase his stock by 50 cards?

Yes. And reduce his cash.

Yes. In fact the TC that he was sent increased his
stock by 100 cards, which caused a $0 card overshoot,
a 50£10card overshoot. He is therefore left £500

short on that premise, isn't he? If that's correct?

Yes, but that’s not

scrateheards and therefore what he should have had

PING. So it is basically you activate your scratchcards

So what he should have had was so it is two

So if you just think about it before we did the
and you get the remin so it balances. What came in was
actually the wrong way round so it didn’t take the 500
to zero, it took it to a minusso it actually is 1,000
not 500 is the effect .

But the difference he is complaining about is 500.

Yes, why-- okay, the difference is then -- so
Mr Latif's practice was to -- as soonas he activated
the scratchcards in his post office he would then buy
them -- sell themonto his retail. So what he would do
straight away is he would processa sale for £500.
That's what he would do and that was his practice and
that’s quite -- a lot of people do that because it is
easier to keep the cash separate.

‘That would show asa sale on the information. Now,
what he has done in this case is when — because he’s
got negative stock figures, he couldn't balance with the
negative stock figures and then when they have looked
they can see that they've got negative stock figure on

the seratcheard, it’s showing a minus. So they then

Day 6

1 that you identified as having occurred in December 2011
2 and you say that he contacted NBSC regarding the
3 shortfall, the call was made on the 13th:
4 “I understand from Post Office’s solicitors and
5 Fujitsu that this particular issue was resolved
6 following an investigation as PEAK PC0214226. Iris
7 possible that Mr Tank contacted the banking team direct
8 (if he had their contact details ), but such calls are
9 not logged”
10 And the result of this is that he is repaid.
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Andyou say at paragraph 87 you have described above at
13 paragraph 53:
14 *.. the process which subpostmasters need to follow
15 when there is a system outage or power failure and,
16 providing this process is followed, Horizon will either
17 recover or cancel the transaction. The online banking
18 transaction which Mr Tank has described is a recoverable
19 transaction and therefore
20 This is the important bit:
21 “if the correct recovery process had been
22 properly followed in accordance with the Horizon Online
23 quick reference guide, a copy of which appears at [POL
24 number which you have now amended to the correct one],
25 the branch would not have sustained any shortfall ”
49
1 So the point there is user error by Mr Tank; that’s
2 the point you're making?
3 A. So-- no, the point here is that the -- well, there was
4 a user error from Mr Tank in that he gave all the
5 receipts to the customer.
6 Q Sorry, say again?
7 A. Im that he gave all the receipts to the customer, that
8 was his error, so he didn’t have that information. But
9 in this -- so there's two things. In the case of
10 Mr Tank then what's happened in his situation is that
11 other than give the receipts, didn’t do anything -- it
12 wasn't user error because the recovery failed and
13 actually
14 Q. Yes.
15 A. Sorry. And what happened here was that the failed
16 recovery was then picked up by Fujitsu in the back end
17 that comes in to Post Office and then we generate the TC
18 to the branch, which is what actually did happen here.
19 Q. Well, let’s see what actually did happen, 1 mean let’s
20 just be very precise, because I'm going to suggest to
21 you that when anything happens because of Horizon, if
22 there is any user error by an SPM that happens at the
23 same time but is not causative, Post Office mentions
24 user error in a way that suggests it is causative.
25 Do you recognise that?

oPOo>

In this situation, yes
Yes. And the fact is that any user error by Mr'Tank was
not causative of the error that was generated?
No, it wasn't.
And so when we re-read that part which I said was the
important bit at the top of page 21, you say:

*.. therefore if the correct recovery process had
been properly followed in accordance with the
Horizon Online quick reference guide ... the branch
would not have sustained any shortfall *

That's not correct, is it?
Not in this. situation , no.
No.
It was - so in this situation it was the receipts,
because onthe receipts it actually does tell Mr Tank
what-- you know, what the situation -- what's happened.
Well, let's take it in stages
as an acronym?

Do you know what UEB is

Sorry, U?
UEB, have you ever heard of that?
No.

User error bias?
No, I can’t say
It is where people in IT constantly blame the user when

actually it is not their fault?

51

Okay, I haven't heard that before.
You haven't heard that?

No.

Well, let's look at this because I’m suggesting to you
this is a common theme that runs through Post Office’s
approach when these issues are raised. Is that a fair
suggestion?

I think what! have tried to explain is what the
approach is, in 99 out of 100 that would be the case
In this situation it is slightly different

Well, it’s slightly different in the sense that it is
not his fault and you have suggested that it is?
Right, well, I didn’t intend to suggest it was
completely his fault. I mean him giving the receipts
back to the customer was user error and had he held onto
those he would have seen exactly... but other than that
I mean he couldn't have done anything because it was

a failed recovery anyway and he did do what the receipts
will have told him whichis to pay out, which is what he
did.

He did what the receipts told him to do, didn’t he?

To pay out. It was an authorised payment, yes.
So when we follow it through -- I'm going to have to
take it reasonably speedily, stop me if there’s anything

that you need more time on.

Okay.
But if we look at {F/870} we can see this is the PEAK
and if we go to page 2 please {F/870/2} and look at the
summary, do you see the second box down:

“The banking transaction had completed (A3 received
and authorised ...), including the receipt print
money should have changed hands”

Yes?

and

Yes.
So that's what Horizon would be directing him to do on
the receipt, wouldn't it?

That's correct

And that is what he did?

Yes.

We then see:

“The disconnected session receipts show ‘cash to
customer 195.04, so the customer's account should be
correet but the branch will have a shortage (for

a withdrawal) because the session hasn’t been recorded.”
That's correct.

Can we pause there.
should?

In that it catches it in the back-end, then yes.
And ther
take you to it, but it’s at (F/871.2] which shows us

Is this Horizon workingas it

's a reference to a further PEAK I need not

53

that there are in fact 492 failed recovery transactions
captured in that PEAK, Were you aware of that?

1 wasn’t aware of that number, no.

Did anyone show you the KEL at {F/1700}? Can we look at

that please, And you can see the date of this KEL has

been it has been raised by Anne Chambers on
28 February 2010.
Yes.

Did you know that there was a KEL relating to all this
that had been going on since 2010?
1 wasn’t aware.
You weren't aware of that

If we just go down please under “problem”, just have
a look there, there’s a paragraph underneath the
subparagraphs (a) to (e):

“If a Tl recovery request times out at the
counter ..”
Because timing out is a problem, isn’t it?

It is if it i

mid-transaction, yes.

recovery is abandoned and no second attempt is made
to get the recovery information. This is as designed;
it was decided to keep recovery simple and not have too
many error paths. The priority is to get the user
working again, so in this sort of error path we just

mark the recovery as failed and leave it for SSC to sort

out
So it is designed into the system that in that

situation the SPM will have a discrepancy that they

can’t figure out and has to be corrected by SSC; that’s

the effect of it, isn’t it?

When you say not figure out, the receipts which is -- as

Mrs Burke's evidence was, she had the receipts and she

could figure it out, but it would havea discrepancy,

absolutely.

Well, they can’t figure out why, when they have done

whatthe actual receipt, if they have kept it, tells

them to do, they have still got a discrepancy?

No, what I'm saying is when you say “figure out", it

would be as Mrs Burke's evidence was it was obvious

to her what that problem was because it didn’t show on

the transaction log, so ..

‘That's as designed anyway?

Yes, as designed, yes.

Let’s look please now if we may at the forum post which

relates to this. It’s at (F/1257.1}.

“Hi all,

"Some advice/help required.

"Yesterday during HOL failure [Horizon Online

You see:

printing 3 identical receipts

“Receipts showed a disconnected session with
recovery code.

"Receipts also showed CAWD limit [minus 195.04]
total due to the customer.”

Et cetera, we have confirmed he is right about that?
Yes
We have seen it in the PEAK?

Yes.
“Because receipts showed cash due to customer, we paid
out.

“Come evening balancing till showed approximately
£200 loss. Thought at time must be miscount and will
try to sort in morning.

“This morning produced transaction log for the
period of HOL failure. No record of 195.04 transaction
at all 1

Yes?

Yes.

That's because it is not recorded internally as
a transaction?

That's right

And it doesn’t show up on the report that the
subpostmaster has access to?

No, it doesn’t

“Phoned helpline and was told by very irate member of
staff that loss is mine unless I can sort out with,
customer directly

In your experience is that the sort of typical
response in that situation?
No, and that’s the wrong response clearly.
It’s wrong, but is it typical?

No, I don’t recognise that. I meanif he has rung up
and said “I've got a disconnected session receipt” then
that should trigger a -- clearly not an irate member
anyway but it would trigger a different response.
Ona lot of these helpline records we see them say that
they read out the KBA in response.
Yes.
That's the knowledge based article.
Yes.
Another word for that is a script?
It would be where the information is, yes.
Yes. So often the helpline are responding by reference
to something from the knowledge based article?
Yes. So rather than put the actual thing in they
actually refer to knowledge base, yes.
Okay. Then after the brackets where he says "HAS ANYONE
SEEN THIS" in capitals , he says

“Asked irate staff to pass call up as I was not

‘a happy bunny, was told she was not going to do this,
only after I asked to speak to contracts manager or

Is that acceptable?
No.
Is it typical?

. No. I mean you would get the odd, you know, bad

experience, but that is not typical in my experience of
helpline staff .
"So spoke to POCA lady at Chesterfield who after
pressing a few buttons was able to find transaction

So it is clear that Post Office had access to

can get a credit TC after she has spoken to Fujitsu 2222?
She took my [number] and promised to call back after
speaking to Fujitsu, being very non-committal about the

You have heard of it?
Yes.
And you can understand why people faced with that sort
of response might take that view?
Well, given that I said it wasn’t typical, I think for
£176 I would always ring, personally.
So that tends to suggest that the person there had had
some pretty bad experiences if they weren't prepared to
follow that up, because it’s quite a lot of money?

Well, yes, if they were happy to put £176 when they

89

could have sought help with it
Okay. Let’s have a look very quickly please at the
helpline log at (F/1286.1}. Because as well as the
forum post we just looked at and his description of what
he did the very next day, we have what the helpline
recorded from his call at row 120. I'msorry, on the
remedy tab, Ms Mackenzie has very helpfully reminded me.
Row 120.

Can we just go across please to the detailed

description:

‘alled this morning about a Horizon failure
yesterday, branch completed a withdrawal and the 195.04
failed recovery receipt time ... recovery code ... card
account withdrawal limit ”

Just go across to the right please. You see
Priority: low” in the incident log, do you see that?
Yes.

Do you think that should be a low priority?

‘That's the classification on the remedy system, it
doesn’t actually apply to that particular call, it’s
just a hangover from the old system.

Whatis that recording if not the priority to be
afforded to that incident?

So that would -- so my understanding of that is if it

politicians saying there is no known fault with Horizon,
something gets my goat.”

This is typical of the frustration that you have
encountered from SPMs, isn't it?

A. In some instances, yes.
Q. Can we move on now please to the Patnys and I’m going to
have to take this slightly more speedily.

In relation to paragraph 62 of your witness
statement {E2/5/18}, the POL reference there, the
document that actually was referenced, was not the
helpline logs, it was the helpline service desk logs,
yes, which is a different document?

AL Yes

Q. That's now been corrected in your corrections to the
correct POL reference 05114278. Indeed the document at
paragraph 63 has been corrected on Thursday of last week
to the correct number so that they match the documents
to which hyperlinks had been added on Opus.

Do you know how it was
already at the last time of asking, but do you know how

we have covered this

it was that all these document references were to the
wrong things?

A. Sorry, I don’t. I meanIhad the information I used and

I didn’t do the referencing myself, so I just apologise

for thar.

65

Q. If welook at
declarations made on 4 February 2019 which is at
{11/186}. 1 won't take you to it, And your solicitors
wrote back and said, on 11 February at {H/196}, that

there was a request for cash

they would be provided.
What we get at {F/1514.1}, if wecan look at that,
wasn’t disclosed until 7 March. Did you know about any
of those requests for documents that related to your
evidence in the background or not?

A. No, I haven't been involved in that.

Q. Could we just go into the properties of that document
please, “File” at the top. Wesee this document was
created on 1 March 2019 by somebody called
Andrew Keighley.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: "Properties" 1 think. You are being
asked to look at “Related dates” under *Properties” on
the right-hand side

Do you see? Have you got the
‘common screen?

A. Oh, sorry. Right, yes, sorry.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: It is an information block that is
attached to the file and it says "Properties" in the
right-hand corner. Do you see that?

A. Sorry, I was expecting a spreadsheet, sorry. Yes.

MR GREEN: Do you seeit is created on 1 March 2019?

AL Yes.

eIAHkYOnE

And the author is somebody called Andrew Keighley. Who
is he?
He works in the cash management part of the supply
chain.
And Shirley Hailstones is someone who helped you with
your witness statement in November?
She is, yes, in my team, yes
So did you have this document, if we go back, or
a different document when you were looking at the
Patnys’ situation?
1 don’t recall which date it was but certainly when
I looked at it I looked at the transaction log and the
event logs for this, but not all of this.
I'm going to take —- Mrs van den Bogerd, you will
understand I'm just going to take this a bit more
speedily
Yes.
When you were dealing with the analysis of the Patnys’
situation in paragraph 66 (E2/5/18} and so forth
Yes.

you didn’t mention stamps anywhere?
No.
And you didn’t mention calls to the NBSC?
No.

Was there in he reason for that? They are pretty

67

prominent features of the case?

No, other than I said this was at a time where I put

this together, then I didn’t have a huge amount of time
to put this together, but

Okay. What we seein the call logs -- and I’m talking
about the logs we have I think already seen but they are
at {F/1509.1} if we could just look at those

in court I think when you heard a positive allegation of

You were

dishonesty being put to Mr Aakash Patny, weren't you?
Yes, I was.

‘That he was inflating the stamps to conceal cash

deficit ?

Yes, I was here, yes.

But that’s not an allegation that you suggested in your
witness statement?

No, I haven't.

And the reason for that is you don't believe that’s
necessarily what he was doing?
I didn’t offer an opinion at all. WhatI wasin this
looking to do was to try and look at what he said had
happened and look at what we could see from the data
Now, what we can see is that the stamps are overdeclared
and that has a corresponding cash entry and there was

a loss beforehand, but I haven't gone further with any

other suggestion on this.

1 Q. Just pausing there, you will remember from his evidence LQ. Doyou know why a Credence report would not be produced
2 that you heard that he explained that when he called the 2 in a situation like this?
3 helpline they took him through some complicated steps to 3A. Sothe Credence - I meanit’s actually not Credence in
4 try and sort it out. Doyouremember that? Do you 4 here that's -- so there is some-- so, sorry, the NBSC
5 remember that evidence? 5 don’t use Credence, they use Horace, which gives a
6 A. Sorry, I don’t actually. I thought it was when he spoke 6 Credence only goes back three months, Horace goes back
7 to somebody in Chesterfield rather than the helpline 7 six months, which is better --
8 Q. It mayhave beenin Chesterfield. In any event he was 8 Q. But this is within
9 taken -- I think there are a number of occasions, but 9 A. So wedon't normally produce either Credence or Horace
10 the point is this, that the Credence report would show 10 information for branches themselves because it would be
at the specific keystrokes by the operator in branch, a1 difficult for them to interpret the data, as you found
12 wouldn't they? 12 out looking at the different lines. But in terms of if
13° A. Yes 13 he has requested and we said we would produce then we
14 Q. Andso if one had wanted to get to the truth about what 14 should have produced
15 keystrokes Mr Patny had pressed, one could have obtained 15 Q. If welook at row well, I need not take you to more
16 a Credence report to identify that and that would 16 of it.
17 have 17 My Lord, I think I can deal with some of the
18 A. Haveused a Credence report, yes. 18 transaction isstes in the spreadsheets in closings
19 Q. And that would have shown all the keystrokes pressed 19 without putting them to this witness.
20 A. Yes. 20 Let’s turn now to the MoneyGram issue, if we may,
21 Q -- so youcould follow exactly whathe had done in 21 paragraph 71 of your witness statement (E2/5/19}. Again
22 sequence? 22 the POL reference was to event data not to transaction
23 A. Yes. 23 data. If we goto the correct document which is,
24 Q. Andwecan see at row 140 of this spreadsheet, if we go 24 {F/1436.1} please, just trace this through if we may,
25 across, you will see the £17,000 shortage. If you just 25 can we look at the sheet 1 and go please to row 1066.
69 71
1 look at the top youcan see that -- if we go to the 1 Do you see that?
2 “Resolution” column which is to the right, and you look 2 A. Yes.
3 at line 140, if you go to “Emailed ESG”, just click on 3 Q. Doyou know what those codes are?
4 that. Above can you see: 4 A. Not off the top of myhead,no. Other than “1” being
5 “Emailed ESG Thursday 26/05/2016 ... requesting 5 cash.
6 Credence report. Please see attached documents. 6 Q. So it appears when we compare this with the session data
7 Advised office of Credence info office adamant stamps 7 wecan see what they are, but can I just invite you to
8 are declaring themselves and overriding (his) figure 8 look at those five lines from 1066.
9 Referred to IT if believes system issue.” 9 A. So it's the MoneyGram for 3,100, yes, I see that.
10 So at that date it looks as if a Credence report 10 Yes, 3,100, 3,100. And if we look now -- you see how
11 should have been requested, doesn’t it? 11 many lines there are there that relate to -- appear to
12 A. Yes 12 relate to the MoneyGram transaction?
13 Q. And the Credence report would have shown the keystrokes? = «13—A._‘Yes.
14 A. Yes. 14 So we've got five transactions there in that run. 40170
15 Q Andif Mr Paty had been dishonest, it would provide 15 is MoneyGram repeat send, just to get your eye in
16 powerful evidence of his dishonesty, wouldn't it, the 16 MR JUSTICE FRASER: Code 40170 is MoneyGram .?
17 precise keystrokes entered? 17 MRGREEN: Repeat send.
18 A. Potentially, yes. 18 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Yes.
19 Q. Andit is Mr Patny we see chasing up and repeatedly 19 MR GREEN: And if we look down you can see 40173 is
20 requesting the Credence report in these logs? 20 MoneyGram cancel. So you've got five lines there from
21 A. Yes. 21 40170 down to 40173.
22 Q. It doesn’t make any sense if he thinks he has been 22 Can we look at the session data now please to match
23 dishonest, does it? 23 that up, it’s (F/1437.1}. If we goto row 4449 please.
24 A. Well, he wants to see the information. I mean that’s 24 23 February, if we just go across to the right very
25 what he is after, isn’t he? 25 slightly you will see here that we can now see from the

session data the item alongside the code: 40170. If we
click on the MoneyGram I think we can see above
“MoneyGram repeat send”, and we come down one, we've got
“MoneyGram send classic” and then we've got underneath
it "Visa debit payment’, underneath that we've got
"Cash" and then underneath that we've got "MoneyGram
cancel”

So we've got two transactions at 12.37 recorded, one
at 12.42 andtwoat 12.49. Do you see those?
Yes.
How many session receipts would you expect to find in
the event data and for which entries?
I'm not sure.
Let's look at the event data, (F/1435}
sheet 1, sorry. And if we look at row 429, we have only

It is onthe

got four session receipts
Okay.

And if we just look at the time there, the first twoare
the two transactions at 12.49, but there doesn’t seem to
bea session receipt between 12.13, which is up above at
line 422, and 12.49, Do you know why there don’t seem
to be any session receipts for the two lines we saw at
12.37 or the one we saw at 1.42?

Sorry, I don’t know the answer.

So paragraph 72 of your witness statement, if we go back

73

to that please, it is (E2/5/19}, you have now amended
that paragraph, essentially deleting all the words
after -- well, fromand including "Mr Patny says” in the
third line

Yes.

And the reason for that is because that’s precisely what
we see when we look at the helpline advice, that he was
told to settle to cash and reverse and what he did was
settle to cash and not reverse at the time, but he says
he did so later at just after 7 o’clock in the evening,
yes?

He was told to cancel and reverse, yes.

Has any of the evidence that I have taken you through
yesterday about the fact that this is in the week with
the PEAK latency -

Right.

-- in relation to MoneyGram ~ that massive spike in
latency, do you remember?

Mm-hm.

And the fact that your account of what people were told
to do in terms of calling NBSC didn’t actually apply to
Mr Patny because it came afterwards
yesterday?

The instruction you mean? Yes.
Yes.

do you remember

Yes.
The instruction was not to call NBSCat the time he did
it, was it?

No -- well, yes, just after it came out, yes.

So it took place in the week with PEAK latency problems,
Duplication of transactions was a known issue in
relation to MoneyGram in that specific week. He did
precisely what the helpline told him in terms of
settling to cash and that’s why he did it and Mr Paty
appeared to be worried about the polling time being
after 7 o'clock, in circumstances when we saw that

Post Office's internal documents didn't pick up the
disconnect and correct it between polling time for
MoneyGram and Post Office until more thana year after
this.

Now, does any of that cause you to reconsider your
view of what may have happened in Mr Patny's case with
his difficulties with an apparent duplication of £3,100?
Sorry, looking at the information that I have seen on
this, he did ring the helpline, so he did ring anyway.
Whether he had had the instruction or not, but he knew
he hada problem so he rang. I can see no evidence of
reversal there, which is why we issued the TC.

And are you aware that reversals don’t sometimes show up

in the data that's recorded by Post Office?
75
So on -- well, we have issued a TC because he hadn't

reversed, which is why we have issued the TC. Had he

reversed and we had issued a TC, he would have had

a positive variance from that T
Short point to you: I’m just asking you, he made the
point that he was actually doing his reversal that he
had forgotten to do at the time, he accepted that was
not right

Yes.

He makes the point that he attempted to doa reversal at
7.04 in the evening but that was after polling time.
Okay.

You have seen that at the very time he encountered what
he believed was a doubling problem, internal documents
show that that was a recognised feature of the latency
issues which were at their peak in that very week.
Okay.

Does that cause you to reappraise the likelihood of him
being at fault in the way you have suggested?

Well, I think at the time if we were aware of that we
should have looked into that for him when he has rung
into the helpline, if we were aware of that at the time.
No one told him, "Mr Patny, in fairness to you this is
a system-wide problem which is peaking this week”, did
they?

1 Callendar Square bug. I would like to ask you about the 1 A. No

2 Dalmellington bug first. Could I ask you to go to 2 Q. ~ the stock unit?

3 {F/1426}. This is a document which I suspect you have 3 A. Mr Latif said that when he transferred from one to the

5 the document. It is a KEL, it’s a Fujitsu KEL relating 5 therefore he reversed, is whathe said, so this is very

6 to the Dalmellington bug. Might you have seen this 6 different to this

10 it. 10 data and what happened in his branch?

11 (Pause). 11 A. No.

12 A. Okay. 12 Thank you.

13. Q._ Now, when you were asked about Dalmellington I think 13 Now, Callendar Square, it was also put to you that
14 Mr Green suggested to you that this should have been in 14 you should have borne Callendar Square in mind. Are you
15 your mind as a possible explanation for what was 15 familiar with the Callendar Square bug?

18 Mr Latif’s branch involve any outreach element? 18 Q. Let meremind you. If we could go to D2 tab 4 please,

1A. Yes:

2 Q Doyou recall the year that Mr Latif suffered his

3 problem?

4 A. Exactly no, but it was later than that. Sorry, 1 would

5 have to refer to my statement.

6 Q Yes, why don’t we. Your statement doesn’t actually -

7 the months you look at are June, July and August 2015,

8 A. That's right, yes. Sorry.

9 Q So this is a bug that happened beforehand and Mr Coyne
10 says that it occurred in Legacy Horizon and he refers to
aL a data communication error in Riposte. Now, when
12 Mr Latif suffered his problem was he using
13 Legacy Horizon?

14. A. No.

15  Q And this may be beyond your expertise and if it is

16 please tell me, but as far as you are aware does

17 Horizon Online, the system that Mr Latif was using, use
18 the Riposte system?

19 A. I don't think it does, but that would be beyond me.
20 Q. Very good. But bearing in mind the year and the system

21 on which this bug occurred, do you feel that you should
22 have actively bornein mind the possibility that
23 Mr Latif’s problem was caused by the Callendar Square
24 bug?
25 A. No.
89
1 Q. Thank you.
2 Now, you were asked some questions about Mr Tank and
3 in particular ona number of occasions you said Mr Tank
4 should have kept the disconnected session receipt .
5 Do you remember that?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Now,why-- I’mnot criticising Mr Green here but why do
8 you think that’s significant? What difference would it
9 have made if Mr Tank had had the receipt?
10 A. Because that -- 1, it tells the postmaster what to doin
11 that particular situation, whether to give cash to or
12 take cash from, and that helps him identify then -- so
13 for instance in this situation if the transaction is
14 missing then he would be able to use that receipt to be
15 able to identify that as well, so he’s got much better
16 position of what's happened in his branch,
17 Q. Andwith the benefit of that receipt, when a postmaster
18 phones into the helpline with a problem with his
19 accounts, does that assist the process
20 A. Yes.
21 Q ~ the fact that there is a receipt? Perhaps you could
22 explain why that is so?
23 A. So ringing into the helpline to say that "I have an
24 issue, I have a disconnected receipt, a recovery
25 receipt”, whatever the situation is, that’s very

different to saying “I have a diserepancy of £200"
195 in this instance -- “and I don’t know whatit is,
it’s a very different scenario and the helpline will
respond differently to that

Very good, thank you.

Now I would like to ask you about quite a lengthy
correction regarding the Helen Rose report. Do you
remember the Helen Rose report?

Yes, I do, yes

The report is at {F/1082}. If we could look at page 1
of that report (F/1082/2}, at the bottom of the page you
will see that -- well, from halfway down it is headed
“Questions asked and extracts from various emails in
response”. It is worth remembering thar this was sent
on 12 June and so what is contained below that

heading -- perhaps I can ask you: what do you think

the text in blue -- the text in black andthe text in
blue, what do you think that represents?

That was the response from Gareth Jenkins to the -- so

I think what Helen has done is just cut and pasted that
into this document

I see. So it would have been various emails that were
written -- exchanges of emails that were written leading
upto 12June, is that right?

Yes, and you can see that she has referenced the email

OL

at the bottom there. 30 January 2013.
So it’s quite a long time, that’s quite an early email,
isn’t it, it’s six months before this report was
written?
Yes.
And if we look at that paragraph - well, if we look at
the previous paragraph, this is Mr Jenkins, he says
about halfway down:
"The fact that there is no indication of such
‘a receipt in the events table suggests the counter may
have been rebooted and so perhaps may have crashed in
which case the clerk may not have been told exactly what
to do”
So there he appears to be suggesting that there was
no receipt?
Yes.
And it was put to you that there was no receipt and you
resisted that suggestion?
Yes.
But it was put to you on the basis of this document that
there wasno receipt. Could we just go to the second
page of this document ~ it is the third page, isn’t it,
I see {F/1082/3}. In the second paragraph down it says
“The files are part of the standard ARQ
returned. Rows 141 to 143 ... clearly showa reversal

Also row 70 ... shows that session 537803 ... has been

reversal session. Also row 71 of events... shows that
a receipt was generated from the session 537805 (not
explicitly , but it was the only session at that time)”

So you didn’t have an opportunity to look at this in
the context of what was being suggested by my learned
friend

AL Yes.

Q. -- but now that you have seen this email, or the quote
from this email which I apprehend is a later email, what
would your reaction be to the suggestion that this
document indicates that no receipt was actually
produced?

‘A. That does say that receipt was produced.

Q. Thank you.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Do you want to stop and revisit it at
2 o'clock?

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: My Lord, yes please.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: I’m afraid you're going to have to come
back. Wewill stop until 2

Now, Mr De Garr Robinson, as you will have noted
from my approach to Mr Green last week in terms of
re-examination, it has to be kept within a narrow

compass. 1 know Mrs van den Bogerd is a very important

93

witness so I’m not cutting you short on your
re-examination, but just bear that in mind.

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: I will endeavour to ensure it is_not
lengthy, my Lord.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: 2 o'clock. Thank you very much.

(1.00 pm)

(The luncheon adjournment)

(2.00 pm)

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Mrs van den Bogerd, we were looking at
the Helen Rose report and I just havea few more
questions about that. The reference is {F/1082}. If we
could look at -- it maybe the second page but it is the
first page of the text {F/1082/2}. At the bottom of the
page you will see there are these three paragraphs which
are pale blue which are copied and pasted from some
earlier Gareth Jenkins email. He says in the first
paragraph that

“This shows that session 537803 was successfully
saved to the BRDB, but when the user JAROO! logged on
again recovery reversed the session in session 537805."

And in relation to that it was put to you and you
fairly accepted when you were being examined by Mr Green
that it was Horizon that caused the reversal of the
session.

Could you explain what's meant by recovery reversed

the session; could you explain what that means? That's
a slightly open question but I have to ask you open
questions.
It means that the recovery process itself , what's
triggered as a result of the loss of connectivity here
then actually reversed that transaction and that was
triggered by the postmaster logging on after the system
had come back up.
So it was the postmaster logging on
Yes.
- that was the start of the process but it was then
recovery which when faced with the postmaster logging on
caused the transaction to be reversed, is that right?
That's right.
Then in the third paragraph down:

“The reversal was due to recovery .. so this was
not a explicit reversal by the clerk ”

It may be that you don’t, but do you know what
Mr Jenkins means when he says “explicit reversal by the
clerk”?
What he meansis that the, it would be the postmaster in
this instance, didn’t actually go in and doa reversal
himself, so he didn’t actually go and look for the
session number to do the reversal.

I see. Now, when you were asked some questions about

95

this document you referred to an email
Yes.
And it mightbe that I know the email you were referring
to. Could I ask you to go please to {F/1095.1}. I will
just give youa minute or two just to familiarise
yourself with that document.
That's right, yes.

(Pause).

Yes, I do recall the email.
Right. If one goes halfway down this page you will see
it is an email chain but there's an email there from
John Armstrong to Ron Warmington. Can you tell me
John Armstrong was?
Ue is the postmaster at Lepton.
And who is Ron Warmington?
He is one of the directors at Second Sight
If we could go now to page 6 of that document
{F/1095.1/6), this is an email from Mr Warmington to
Mr Armstrong and it is dated 25 June, so this is nearly
two weeks after the Helen Rose report, just so we can
locate ourselves in the chronology, and Mr Warmington
from Second Sight says

“John, as I mentioned we are including your incident
in our interim report to be delivered to MPs on July 8.

It’s one of only four spot reviews that we are at this

stage disclosing
Can you explain what a spot review is?
It was terminology that Second Sight used for a deep

dive into an issue that had been raised, so they
investigated an issue and they termed it a spot review.
I see. And if we goon to the next paragraph:

“Here is whatwe have in the report on your
incident. If you see anything at all here that needs to
be corrected, or could be improved in any way, please
let me know and I'll change it.”

Then there’s some text I need not take you to and
then going down to below the next paragraph he says
“Report extract follows here” and if you could read the
bottom of that page and then the top of page 7
{F/1095.1/7}. Youcan tell us when you get to the
bottom of the page.

Under *SR001", from there, is that where you mean?
And then when you get to the bottom tell us and we will
go on to page 7.

Yes, turn the page please.

(Pause).

Okay so the bottom of that paragraph, yes?

Okay. And then we have "SROO1 summary of POL’s
response” and then we have:

*POL's 10-page response asserts that the Spot

97

Review:

“Does not demonstrate any failing in Horizon.

* Principally asks whether a SPMR will be properly
notified about automatic reversals of transactions when
Horizon is unable to connect to the data Centre.”

And then I don’t need to take you to the next
paragraph but in the next paragraph but one says

“POL further asserts in its response that the root
suffered by the SPMR was his
failure to follow the on screen and printed instructions
given by Horizon.

cause of the difficulties

POL claimed to be confident that the
SPMR knew that some transactions had been automatically
reversed because

First:

“The branch had been suffering connectivity issues
in the run-up to the incident in question

Do yousee that?
Yes.
And then if we go over the page (F/1095.1/8}, second:

“When the transactions in question first failed to
be processed (because Horizon could not get a response
from the data centre), Horizon asked the SPMR whether he
wished to cancel or retry the transactions, in response

to which the SPMR opted to retry the transactions

98

eIAHkYOnE

oProreo

Next:

“When the transactions failed again, the SPMR opted
to cancel the transactions.

“Horizon then automatically disconnected and printed
a ‘disconnect’ receipt that showed the transactions that
had been automatically reversed.”

Next:

“A standard customer receipt was not produced and
POL asserts that this should have told the SPMR that the
full transaction had not proceeded”

And:

“Following the disconnect the SPMR was required to
log back on to Horizon and duly did so”

And:

“Following the log on, and as part of the standard
recovery process, Horizon printed a ‘recovery’ receipt
which again showed the transactions that had been
reversed and those that had been recovered.”

Now, does that refresh your memory as to why you
said you had separate knowledge as to whether or not
Mr Armstrong received a .2
Yes
I see. Let’s move back to page 6 {F/1095.1/6}

the beginning of the same email we looked at and we read

This is

the first big paragraph of the email, I would like to

99

read the second paragraph now:
“lan andi.”
I take it that’s Mr Henderson?
That's correct
*.. are particularly interested to know whether you
received the printed disconnect and recovery * receipts”
that POL refers to in its response
So there’s the question that Mr Warmington asks
Mr Armstrong and Mr Armstrong's reply is at page 4
{F/1095.1/4} and can I ask you please,
Mrs van den Bogerd, just to read the email of Tuesday
25 June from the middle of the page downwards and then
when you've got to the bottom tell us and I will ask you
to read half of the next page.
(Pause).
Yes, I have read that.
(Pause).
Yes.
Let me know when you are done?
Sorry, I’m done.
You're done?
Yes.
Now, first of all -- I hope this is uncontroversial -
what Mr Armstrong seems to be saying there is that he

did receive some disconnected session receipts

AL Yes.

Q. What would the fact of receiving these disconnected
session receipts have told him?

A. It would have told him that the BT bill hadn't actually
been processed.

Q. So we now have more information than Mr Jenkins had in
the emails that are attached or rather quoted in the

wyAnRone

Helen Rose report. If we could go to page 3 of this
9 document please (F/1095.1/3}, this is the second page of
10 an email from Mr Baker from the Post Office,
11 Simon Baker. Do you know who Simon Baker is?
12. A. Hewasa project manager at the time.

13° Q Isee. You will see at the top of the page it says

14 “Regards, Simon” so it is the end of his email but we

15 have Gareth’s comments below, that’s Mr Jenkins”

16 comments. There's a reference to GMT and British Summer
17 Time, this is because the logs used GMT even though BST
18 is in fact in force,

19 Could 1 ask you please to read paragraphs 1 through
20 to 9

21 (Pause).

22 A. Yes, I have finished
23 Q You will see at the bottom in paragraph 9 Mr Jenkins
24 says:

25 “Therefore a message asking for a retry or cancel
101

1 would have been shown at about 09.36.25. At this point

2 cancel” must have been selected thus producing the

3 disconnected session receipt. This fits in with the

4 time of 10.36 in the email below”

5 Would you care to comment? Does that accord with

6 your understanding, or do you have a different

7 understanding?

8 A. No, that’s my understanding.

9 Q. That's your understanding?
10 =A. Yes.
11. Q. So having gone through those documents can I ask you now
12 to go back to your witness statement please to
13 paragraph 154 (E2/5/35} and this is where you say -- I'm
14 going to ask you what you meant by this now. You say in
15 paragraph 154:
16 “At paragraph 5.175 of his report, Mr Coyne has
17 referred to a report prepared by Helen Rose ... in the
18 context of failed reversals. The extracts taken from
19 the report by Helen Rose referred to by Mr Coyne are
20 taken out of context and mistakenly claim that the
21 relevant reversal was issued in error by Horizon not the
22 subpostmaster”
23 I just wantto give you an opportunity -- Mr Green
24 was pressing you to accept that actually what you had
25 said in that sentence was wrong. I would like to give

102

eIAHkYOnE

you an opportunity to explain to the court what you
actually meant.

What I meant was that the actual reversal was part of
that recovery and it had actually taken place as it
should have taken place, which is whatI meantin that.
So it wasn't a failed reversal because it actually had
happened as it should have happened, but I accepted in
there that the -- it wasn’t obvious to the postmaster at
the time that what had happened ~ that he hadn't
because it didn’t show that he had actually -- it showed
that he had done it and he knew he hadn't done what we
referred to earlier wasan explicit reversal. That's
what! meantin that

I won't take any more time up on that question.

Just two more small matters, Mrs van den Bogerd.
First of all, it was put to you by Mr Green on page 80
of yesterday's transcript {DayS/80:16} that Mrs Mather's
statement shows that Credence contains a log of every
key that’s pressed
Yes.

on the counter and I would like to take you to
Mrs Mather’s statement, if I may. That's E2, tab 8 and
I would like to go to page 2 of that statement please,
paragraph 9 (E2/8/2}. You will see whatMrs Mather
actually says in the first sentence.

103

Yes.
Now, the reason why I’m putting this to you is because
Mr Green put to you that Credence shows every single
keystroke that’s pressed by the postmaster and you
accepted what he said and he put it to you on the basis
that this is whatMrs Mather said. Could I ask you this
question: is it the case that Credence gives an account
of every single key that’s pressed by the postmaster in
branch?
That's not my understanding, not every single stroke
I'm grateful

Then one small final question.

It is based upon the

You were taken to this document by

I would like to explore that very briefly with you.

A. I didn’t think it was necessary.
MR JUSTICE FRASER: All right
Then can we call upa document please, (F/1449},
which is a document we looked at yesterday. Do you
remember Mr Green asked you some questions about this
document?

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And it shows two different approaches
depending on whether the amount of the miskey was
greater than £150 or not?

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Now, I'ma bit confused about the
document whieh is just why I wanted to ask you,
say the miskey is £200, am! right you would go down the
right-hand branch as we look at it and the branch would

Let's

be told that if the discrepancy, which in my example is
£200, was still apparent when they were balancing they
must make the amount good?

A. That's what it says on here

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And I recall from the common issues
trial that means they would, for example, have to pay
the £200in, is that right?

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Right. If we look at the left branch,
which is for less than 150, so let’s say that that’s

109

£50, there seems to be a little bit more to it, which
includes the possibility of a transaction correction.

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Have I read that correctly?

A. Yes.

This is a bit confusing on -- I haven't seen this

before. Because to me the significance of 150is the

amount that you can settle centrally or not and

therefore in reading it that way, which is how I would

interpret that -- so if yousaid it was over 150, what
should be in that box is when it says "Must make good”
the option in there should be to settle centrally
because it’s over the 150.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Well, let’s say we read it in that way,
so that includes settling centrally

AL Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Go back to the left -hand box, that seems
to include within it the possibility of a transaction
correction being sent out later, because it says that in
the last four lines

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: That entry is not on the right-hand
side, so amI correct in reading this chart that if it
is above 150, that option is not potentially available,
but if it’s below 150, a transaction correction might be

sent out in the future?

A. It mightbe sent out if it is over 150 as well

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Well, that then takes me to my next
question: but it doesn’t say that on the right-hand
side.

A. No.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Can you think of any reason why that
might not be in the box on the right-hand side?

A. The only reason I can think of that is that this is an
incomplete document and, as say, I"ve never -- I can’t
recall ever seeing this, but that wouldn't make sense to
me reading that as currently presented.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: All right
very useful.

Now, any questions arising out of that?

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Just about timing.

Further re-examination by MR DE GARR ROBINSON,

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Mrs van den Bogerd, when you made your

witness statement do you recall that it wasin response

to some witness statements made by the claimants?

Yes.

Thank you very much. That's

And were those witness statements expected?
No.
Did you expect to be dealing with that kind of evidence

when it came?
A. No. No, I didn’t at the time.

Q. So these witness statements came in. Do you recall how
much time you had to prepare the witness statement in
response?

A. I don’t remember exactly but it would have been from
memory about three weeks or so. I can’t remember
exactly

Q. And you say three weeks, but before you could properly

Examination-in-chief by MR DE GARR ROBINSON

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Ms Phillips, there should be a bundle

of documents to hand. If I can ask you to go to tab 3

of that document (E2/3/1), I believe the first page of

that document should describe itself as a witness
statement of Dawn Louise Phillips, do you see that?

Yes.

Is that your name and address there at the front?

Yes, it is

If you go to page 3 of the statement, is that your

signature at the end?

A. It is

Q. Andis this witness statement true to the best of your

113

knowledge, recollection and belief?

AL Yes, it is

Q. Ms Donnelly will have some questions for you. Thank you
very much.

Cross-examination by MS DONNELLY

MS DONNELLY: Good afternoon, is it Ms or Mrs Phillips?

AL Ms.

Q. Ms Phillips, in your witness statement you say you are
team leader for agent accounting and Santander banking?

AL Yes.

Q. So I will deal with those separately if I may, taking
agent accounting first. Can understand from your
paragraph 4 (E2/3/2}, you say:

*. I oversee the process of recovering the losses
that postmasters have declared in branches.”
Are you the team leader for agent accounting?

AL Yes.

Q. And when you are referring to “recovering the losses”,
are you referring there to the amount that they have
settled centrally?

A. Yes.

Q. If youlook at paragraph 7 of your witness statement
which is at {E2/3/2}, do you see three lines down there
you refer to “chosen to settle shortfalls centrally"?

A. Why he.

You fairly recognise, don’t you, at paragraph 9 that
there's no option for the postmaster to dispute the
discrepancies on Horizon, or record that they have
raised a dispute on Horizon?

They chose to settle centrally rather than make good is
whatl meant.

Yes, settle centrally rather than put the cash in
straight away?

Yes.

‘And that system remains the case today -- your witness
statement is September.

Yes.

And that remains the system.

Where you describe the agent accounting team, in the
common issues trial back in November of last year we
heard reference to the current agent debt team
That's the old name.

Does the substance of what you do remain the same?

Yes.

So there’s really been a semantic change from “debt” to
“accounting”?

(Nods).

And has the same thing happened with former agent debt?
Yes, it’s former agent accounting.

But what that team is doing is debt recovery from

115

subpostmasters who have left or been terminated?
Not just debt recovery, there are gains settled
centrally as well that we also deal with.
The real substance of your statement is the dispute
process as it nowis.
Yes.
And looking at your paragraphs 7 and 8 {£2/3/2} we see
you refer the court to two letters, one at the end of
paragraph 7 and one at the end of paragraph 8.1. Now,
those versions that you are referring to there, do you
know when they were introduced?
1 September 2014.
And are they still the current versions?
Yes.
So if we could look please at { F/1832}. Do we see
there the first of the letters that would be sent?
Yes.
Just from looking at the first four paragraphs we see:
“Please find the attached statement that confirms
the amount you owe to Post Office Limited. The
statement provides a breakdown of how you have incurred
the total owed amount.
“There are a number of ways you can repay the money
to us; you will find all the details of the different

methods of payments on the reverse of this letter

Day 6

1 “If you would like to repay the money by

2 debit/credit card...

3 Then it goes on:

4 “We look forward to hearing from you within the next

5 7 days to arrange payment”

6 ‘The wording used in this letter is as if the amount

7 is a debt to Post Office that needs to be repaid?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. And the last paragraph says:
10 “If you have any queries regarding the content of
11 this letter, please contact one of my team or drop us
12 an email at agents.accounting.team@postoffice.co.uk and
13 we will do our best to help you”
14 Now, what's missing from that letter is any mention
15 of a dispute process there?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. If youlook at the first paragraph again, "Please find
18 the attached statement’, that’s not included with the
19 letter that you have exhibited which is this version,
20 but it says it provides a breakdown, so what information
21 would be shown on that statement?
22 A. It would be each individual amount settled centrally in
23 the previous trading period, so it could be one branch
24 discrepancy settled at the end of the month, several
25 transaction corrections and/or an invoice

7

1 Q. So if we go to {F/1257.2), we see here an example

2 I think of the same letter that we were just looking at

3 which was sent to Mr Tank. If we go to page 3

4 (F/1257.2/3}, is that the statement, the form of the

5 statement that would be attached?

6 A. Yes.

7 Q. So here there has been one amount settled centrally and

8 it appears like this, “branch discrepancy” and then the

9 date and the amount.
10 A. Yes.
11. Q. Again, this statement doesn’t have any indication that
12 it is possible to dispute this amount, does it?
13° A. No.
14 Q. Going back to your witness statement at (E2/3/2}, you
15 say at paragraph 8.1
16 “If we do not receive a response within 7 days we
17 senda second letter ”
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. Andas I understand from your witness statement there
20 aren't any phone-- later on you refer to some phone
a1 calls might be made, but there aren't any phone calls
22 in-between this stage, are there?
23° A. No.

24 Q. Andwhen you say “if we do not receive a response”, is
25 that your team?

Yes.
If we go then to {F/1833}, this is the second letter

that you have exhibited

Yes.

“We wrote to you previously requesting payment of the
amount you owe to Post Office Limited.

*We are concerned that you have not contacted us to
arrange payment.

*Payment is now overview due and needs to be made
within 7 days of this letter

“As previously mentioned, there are a number of ways
you can repay the money tous. Theseare listed on the
reverse of this letter ”

So we have all the same language again, haven't we,
that this is a debt?

Mm-hm.
‘Then the next paragraph:

“We have to advise you that if we do not receive
payment or your instructions within this timescale, this
may be escalated to your contracts advisor for further
action”

So what's that supposed to mean?

If they don’t make a payment or raise a dispute with us
then we could send it to the contracts advisor for

further action

119

And in your answer you have referred to “raise
a dispute”, but again there’s no mention of dispute, is
there, in this letter?

Well, in both letters it mentions that if they have any
enquiries they can contact us.

It’s a bit different, isn’t it, to say “If you have any
queries regarding the content of this letter” -- it’s

a bit different writing that to “If you want to raise

a dispute about this amount then please find enclosed
the dispute process"?

Yes.

Are these two letters usually successful in getting
money in?

Sometimes it is resolved even before the second letter
goes out. It varies

But by the time this second letter is sent, normally the
subpostmaster has paid?

Yes.

If we look at your witness statement again, so (E2/3/2},
paragraph 9, in the second sentence there you say that
postmasters are able to call the NBSC helpline or your
team and raise a dispute.

Yes.

The letters we just looked at don't refer to calling the
helpline, do they?

MR JUSTICE FRASER: So if it is not always £5,000 what other
figure limit would it be?

A. It depends. We can sometimes check them all. It
depends how many fresh items have been settled centrally
in that week

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And do you geta list of these?

‘A. [can pull them from our finance system.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Filtered by an amount that you decide
that day?

‘A. No, we pull everything that’s been settled that month.

‘MS DONNELLY: Do you get any transcripts of those helpline
calls?

A. No, wehave to search for them.

Q. There will be a call log, but those helpline calls are
also recorded, aren't they?

AL Yes.
Q. Doyou listen to the recording, or do you just look at
how it's

‘A. We just look at the log on the screen, not a recording.
Q. So the completeness and accuracy of what appears on the
helpline log would be very important to your team?

‘A. Yes, But if we were unsure we would pick up the phone

and speak to the branch.
Q. Doyou send to the subpostmaster the copy of the

helpline log that you are looking at so they know what

125

you've got?

A. No. They made the call, we would assume they would know
what it was.

Q. Well, what the subpostmaster doesn't know is how it has
been recorded by the helpline?

A. Well, we'd discuss that if there wasan issue and we
had to call_them we would discuss that with them,

Q. Is there any auditing of the process that you have just
described being carried out by your team?

A. Yes, we have controls in place that we have to report
and measure every month.

Q. So what are they?

A. So we've got an external firm called Traction that we
have to report to and attach evidence that we have
followed that process every week or month, whatever the
actual process is supposed to be done to.

Q. So do you report -- sorry, did yousay it is an external
company?

A. PwCIdo -- I can’t remember the name of it but we have
‘an external company that we have to load all our
evidence onto

Q. Doyou report to them which value you have decided to

eIAHkYOnE

A

ereor

No.
So that detail isn’t recorded?
No.
If we just look at paragraph 10 of your witness
{E2/3/2}, you say there that:

*If a postmaster calls my team after receiving our
request for payment and explains they are raising

statement which is

a dispute, we will place a block on their account on the
system until the dispute is resolved. If they do this
within 7 days we will not send the second letter
referred to in 8.1 above, but a postmaster can dispute
a shortfall at any stage in the process (not just after
the first letter)"

And then you go on at paragraph 11.

*When a postmaster disputes a shortfall with my team
we gather as much information as possible from the
Wealso send

branch about why they are disputing it.

them a branch dispute form to complete
Just pausing there, is that right, that you gather

as much information as possible and also send them

a branch dispute form?

Not necessarily. If it is something like a miskey which

is just a simple case of the branch recording it with

helpline, we check with helpline that it has been

received and gone to the appropriate team, no need for

127

a dispute form, that’s a simple one. We only send the
dispute forms when it is more in-depth and we have to
pass the information on for someone else to investigate ,
so it is better coming from the postmaster in their own
words, so that’s when the form is sent.

So say it is a more complicated one when you are going
to require a branch dispute form.

Yes.

Doyou first get all the information from them and then
senda branch dispute form for them to provide it all
again?

No. It would probably start it with a discussion on the
phone. If it looked like it was going to be

a complicated one we would stop it there and say "We're
going to send youa form out”, we puta block on the
debt immediately so all the process was halted and then
send them a form and let them fill it in and send it
back.

So your paragraph 11 isn’t quite right, if it’s the
branch dispute form -
No, wedon't do both. It's not required for all of
them.

You don’t necessarily do both and you don’t always send
a branch dispute form?

Only if it is difficult

to NBSC. We wouldn’t-- we cannot pass the dispute on
to a team to investigate if we don't have a team to pass
it on to.

So if somebody writes here "£2,000 short, must have
happened over these three days, don't know exactly why”,
you can’t deal with that?

No.

Andso is the debt unblocked?

We would call the branch back, or reply via email and
tell them to ring NBSC for guidance on how ~ to see if
they can find the loss.

But is the debt unblocked? Is debt recovery --

It depends. We're waiting for them to call NBSC and get
a reference number, we then check the reference number
at a later date and see what NBSC have advised.

And if ultimately the person is not able to provide

a specifie date and product, will the debt be unblocked?
Yes, I'mafraid so.

And why is an NBSC reference number required on the
branch dispute form?

If they have one, we need it.

It doesn’t quite say that though, does it? It suggests
that it is a requirement that you have an NBSC reference
number?

Well, if they've got an issue and they've got a loss,

133

I would have expected them to ring NBSC prior.

Even if they have settled it on the Friday, you sent
your letter on the Monday ..?

Like I say, they still need to -- if they don’t know
what it’s for they still need to ring NBSC.

And what does your team do now you've got this

collection of branch dispute forms? You have told us it
is about five a month. Is there any analysis, or do you
group them together, look for themes?
We don’t deal with the actual dispute. We pass them on.
to the relevant team. That's why we need a product or
something to pass on so we know which team to pass it on
to deal with. We're not experts on the transactions,
but we will pass it on and get a response.

And do you then track how they are resolved?

Yes.

So do you know of the branch dispute forms that came in
last year how many ultimately ended up in the
subpostmaster repaying?

Not off the top of my

You don’t track that?

No.

Sorry, I spoke too quickly.

No, we don't track it. Once the debt is cleared it is

off the system and it’s not part of the measures any

more.
But you appreciate it might ultimately never have been
a debt?

Yes

ind if something arises -- if they have paid and

a transaction correction comes through after, they are
welcome to keep the transaction correction that relates
to the debt that they have already paid
So if there's a need to obtain transaction data or make
an ALQ request, anything like that, that’s not dealt
with by your team?
No.
Could we look please at {11/173/5}. This is part of
a letter sent by the claimants’ solicitor to
Post Office’s solicitors on 22 January of this year. Do
you see at point 9 at the top it says the claimants’
solicitors identified 11 to 12 in your witness statement
and said

“Please disclose documents relating to Post Office's
procedures in its use of the branch dispute form,
including recording internal actions taken on receipt”

Were you told about that request?
I think I was asked if there was any formal dispute
any process relating specifically to the dispute form,
bur it falls in with the rest of the dispute, it’s just

a process that we follow. ‘There's no formal policy or

135

process in place.

No formal policy or process in place .?
Specifically to the branch dispute form.
to any dispute.

So if we go just quickly to (H/227/3}, this is the

response we see from 27 February 2019. Do you see at

It’s generic

point 9 again:
“Post Office has confirmed that there is not

‘a specific document which relates
Do you see that?

Yes

That's effectively what you have just described now?

Yes.

And then it says:
“A flowchart of the dispute process is at ..”
And there is a specific number given. Do you know

what that flowchart is?

Not without looking at it, no.

Can we goto [F/1276}.

Notthe title

Do you recognise that flowchart?

There are two pages to this document, if you want to
just glance quickly at page 2?

Not just yet, thank you.

No.

Day 6

1A. Yes:

2 Q Because how this document was read and understood by

3 both experts acting in this case is that the first

4 column was TCs issued by Post Office to branch?

5 A. No.

6 Q. And the second column is TCs disputed by branch to

7 Post Office?

8 A. No.

9 Q That's completely wrong?
10 A. Yes -- well, no, your perception is wrong I’m afraid
at It does say errors received from Santander, it does not
12 say TCs issued to branch.
13 Q Butyou might not know that both experts read it in that
14 way given the purpose that Mr Smith had set out earlier
15 that’s whathe said he was going to provide and this is
16 what then appeared?
17 A. Thatis errors received from Santander, that is not
18 transaction corrections issued to branch,
19 Q. Andwesee if we goto (E2/15} that Mr Smith provided

20 a further witness statement. We received this on the
21 claimants’ side at 17.48 on Friday 8 March and he says
22 there that he has rereviewed his witness statement, do
23 you see that within paragraph 32
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Sohe spoke to you again, did he?
ua
1 AL Yes.
2 Q. When did you first find out that there was an issue with
3 the figures you had provided that were in Mr Smith's
4 witness statement?
5 A. It’s not an issue with the figures, the figures remained
6 the same, I think it is an explanation of what
7 the headers actually mean.
8 Q. When did you first become aware that some further
9 explanation might be required?
10 A. Because someone assumed that they were transaction
11 corrections issued to branch and it was queried,
12 Q. Sorry, when did you become aware that this -
13° A. Notlong ago.
14 Q. Because if you had provided this evidence rather than
15 Mr Smith you might have been able to explain it a little
16 bit more clearly, do you think?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And if we could go over the page please (E2/15/2}, at
19 paragraph 5 he says
20 “The figures in my first statement of 2,890
21 ‘disputes received from branch’ represents the number of
22 disputes between Post Office and Santander ..”
23° A. Yes.
24 Q. And then paragraph 6:
25 "I understand from my colleague Dawn Phillips that

the Santander manual deposits team issued 3,968
transaction corrections during the financial year
2016-2017"

So if someone had misread Mr Smith's first witness
statement, we've got about a fivefold difference from
about 19,500, it’s actually only around 4,000?

‘That were issued.

Now, what he hasn't told us, or isn’t clear from his
wimess statement, perhaps you can just clarify, is how
many of the 3,968 transaction corrections that were
issued were disputed?
I can’t answer that, I have already been asked that
question and it’s not something we recorded as to
whether Post Office disputed it with Santander on the
postmaster’s behalf with evidence from the branch, or it
was an actual transaction correction dispute.

Had Mr Smith specifically asked you that?

Yes.

And you told him it’s not something that

It’s not something we recorded.

Could we just go back please to {E2/9/5}. Could you
just help us understand if about 19,500 errors are
received by Post Office from Santander and Post Office
actually issue only around 4,000, what has happened to
the rest?

143

So Santander doa manual match of figures to Horizon to
the actual paperwork that they receive. If it doesn’t
match, they sent us an error notice. They were all in
different categories, so several of the categories we
know it was a timing issue and if we just waited a week
they would send us another compensating error to clear
it. A lot, 1 would say 50% of what they sent us could
be cleared with a letter to branch requesting copies of
their paperwork which we could then send back to
Santander.
So it’s quite a lot more complicated than the way it is
presented perhaps in Mr Smith's first or second
statement?
Well, maybe. We issued a lot less than Santander gave
us
So you are doing some sort of internal

That’s a manual process, is it?
Yes.

Day 6

1 MRDE GARR ROBINSON: Ihave only one question, Ms Phillips.

2 You were asked about the dispute process and you were

3 asked what happened if the subpostmaster was not

4 satisfied with a decision that was made at the end of

5 that process, was there an appeal, and you indicated

6 that you would then call in support services for

7 assistance. Could you explain what support services

8 would do?

9 A. Theyare capable of doing a more in-depth investigation
10 than perhaps we could in FSC, so they would be able to
at provide more information and a breakdown of what
12 happened in branch.

13  Q. Andhow detailed would their investigation be?
14 A. Extremely detailed.
15 Q Thank you, Ms Phillips.
16 My Lord, I have no further questions.
17 Questions from MR JUSTICE FRASER
18 MR JUSTICE FRASER: Justa couple of questions on the
19 table - could we go back to it please {E2/9/5}. We've
20 got E2/9/5 on the screen which you have been asked some
21 questions about. ‘The first column I think you say the
22 number is correct but the description is wrong; is that
23 fair?
24 A. No, the errors are received from Santander, but they are
25 not transaction corrections issued to branch.

4s

1 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Should I reading the heading to column 2

2 differently ?

3A. Yes, as in Paul’s second statement

4 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Well, I'm rather asking you because you

5 provided the figures

6 A. So they are just disputes sent to Santander from Paul.

7 They can be disputes where we have sent a letter to

8 branch requesting evidence and not issued a transaction

9 correction, we have just asked for the evidence and it
10 has been provided, or they can be transaction correction
it disputes.

12. MRJUSTICE FRASER: And as far as you know are the headings
13 to the other three headings correct?

14 A. Yes.

15 MR JUSTICE FRASER: They are.

16 One question Ms Donnelly asked you in respect of
17 this and the total which I think is from Mr Smith's
18 second statement is 3,968 in terms of transaction

19 corrections. She asked how many of those 3,968

20 transaction corrections that were issued were disputed
21 and you said you can’t answer that, you have already
22 been asked that question and it’s not sometl

23 record

24 A. No.

25 MRJUSTICE FRASER: When were you asked that question?

146

A. In recent weeks.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: In recent weeks leading up to this
trial?

AL Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: You weren't asked it at the time in
respect of these figures?

A. Notthe first statement. That's how the second
statement came around because we were asked to - we
were asked that question: how many of those TCs were
actually disputed by branch, and I can’t answer it

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Understood.

3. A. It is

4 Q. Anddoyoualso see a document with three corrections to

5 your witness statement at the front of that file?

6 A. Ido.

7 Q Andnow, Mrs Mather, I have to ask a question which is

8 born out of sheepishness on my part. Everyone else in

9 court will understand why, but you won't. I would like
10 to ask you about paragraph 12 of your statement please
a1 {E2/8/3}. Here you are describing Credence and you say:
12 “Credence is used as an information tool. It is
13 designed to work alongside other applications. It is
14 used to help understand what has happened in a branch as
15 it records all keystroke activity performed in that
16 branch by the user ID, date and time.”
17 Could I ask you to explain what you mean by the
18 phrase "It records all keystroke activity"?

19 A. WhatI actually meant was the transactional data as in
20 sales and non-sales.
21 Q Ise, thank you.

22 Subject to the three corrections you have identified
23 and your clarification of paragraph 12, do you confirm
24 that this witness statement is true to the best of your
25 knowledge, recollection and belief?

2 Q. Thank you, if you could wait there please

3 Cross-examination by MR GREEN

4 MRGREEN: Now, Mrs Mather, at paragraph 1 of your witness

5 statement, if we look please (E2/8/1}, you say you are

6 the FSC team leader, so are you the team leader for FSC?

7A. No, sorry, for myteam. It’s just a generic team leader

8 role in FSC.

9 Q. Youare a team leader within FSC?
10 =A. Yes.
11 = Q. Andwhichis your team? Have you got a special team
12 name?
13. A. For the last year anda half 1 have had MoneyGram and

14 cheques I have had for two years, just over two years.

15 Before that I was on payout, postal orders

16 Q. Different things?

17 A. Yes.

18 Q. And how many people work in FSC overall?

19 A. 1 would be guessing

20 Q Roughly?

21 A. 60

22 Q. Anddoyouhave any special training when you move to

23 a new product you are dealing with?

24 A. Not training of such. You tend to -- because the team

25 leaders might move on to another team, so you would
150

1 spend time with that team leader and then when they move
2 into a new area you can always go back if there was
3 something you were unsure of.
4 Q. And when you join FSC in the first place do you sort of
5 pick it up on the job, how does it work?
6 A. FSC- I have always been part of that kind of group
7 since I joined
8 Q. Did they give you any special is training when you
9 joined, or did you .2
10 A. We're going back a long time, but my special training of
12 such was when I was a PA so I was machining so yes, they
12 would give me special training
13 Q The purpose of your statement I think, as you explain at
14 paragraph 8 (E2/8/2}, is to explain how Post Office uses
15 Credence to investigate discrepancies.
16 A. Yes.
17 Q “since the introduction of Horizon and why”, And at
18 paragraph 9 you have explained that
19 “Credence is a system that shows all sales
20 transactions, log on and log off events and all
21 remittances in and out of Horizon”
22 Yes?
23 AL Yes
24 Q. Andwe have seen already that paragraph 12 of your
25 witness statement {E2/8/3} says it is used to help -- if
151
1 you look at the second line, that Mr De Garr Robinson
2 just took you to:
3 *It is used to help understand what has happened in
4 a branch as it records all keystroke activity performed
5 in that branch by the user ID, date and time.”
6 Now, you have said that what you meant by that in
7 fact was sales and things like that?
8 A. Transactional data, yes.

9 Q. What information does it give above and beyond the ARQ
10 data that we have seen?

11 A. We~ for my team, which is the cheques team, where we

12 usually use Credence, is years ago we would have had to
13 ask a postmaster to send his cheque list in for us, if
14 ‘we've got an open item to investigate. With Credence we
15 can save not going out to the postmaster, we can

16 actually have a look to see how postmasters finish

17 transactions off.

18 Q. Andwhathe has typed in in the cheque list at the

19 branch and how it shows up or -

20 A. No, weactually look at all sales to see what

21 transactions he has finished off to cheques.

22 Q. Soyoudon't have access to what we have seen is the ARQ
23 data that’s being pulled from Fujitsu?

24 4. Mmhm.

25  MRJUSTICE FRASER: Is that correct, you don’t have access

Not through Credence, no.

We're just at the

give the court
some understanding of what you can and cannot see. If
you're investigating , for example, a MoneyGram issue,
can you see exactly what the SPM has done in branch on
the sereen in Credence?

With MoneyGram we have two sourees of information and
that is MoneyGram's file and we use Horizon, we don’t
actually use Credence for MoneyGram,

Okay. What do you use Credence for?

Mainly cheques, part of my team.

Now, Credence only holds information for a short period,
I think currently three months; that’s right, isn’t it?
That's right

And are you aware of discussions that have been had
about extending the period for which Credence holds
information to a longer period? Are you aware of any
discussions about extending the period that Credence
holds information for?

We know that we can view Credence up to three months.
There's also a system called Horace, So wecan-- one
of my team members has access to Horace, so we would

look on there.

153

Okay. Let's look if we may at (F/1092} please. Now,
this is a document from June 2013. You will see as at
2013 the branch data available as at that date was
available for 61 days. Is that the same today as far as
you know? Branch data available to you on Horizon? Do
yousee at the top?
Yes, 1 thought ours was 90 days, Credence.
Well, Credence is immediately underneath, Credence data
90 days.
Yes. But when you say branch data I’m not too sure
On Horizon.
Yes
How long is the data available to you on Horizon for?
On Horizon, if we have an open item it’s there until we
investigate it
It can just stay on there for a long time?
Yes.
And next to that it says:

“All transactional data including non-sales eg
adjustments.”

So it’s right, isn’t it, that Credence doesn't just
show sales information, it also includes non-sales

information like any adjustments that somebody has made?

Yes.

And so that gives a fuller picture

-- than just seeing the sales information?
Yes
And that’s why in your statement you have explained that
it helps to see what's happened in the branch?
That's it
And can you see that the -- under -- you can see what's
being considered there in bold. Do you see about
quarter of a way down from the top in bold:

“Consider the benefits of a repository of data for
24 months. Note: this is open for discussion but
24 monthsis the initial gambit?

Do you see that?
Yes.
Would it be more helpful to you to have Credence data
available for longer?
We have ~ there are some reports that wecan still see
information for 24 months on Credence.
Are there now?
Yes.
Do you know when that was extended up to 24 months?
I don't, no, because I wasn't on these particular teams
at that time, because in 2003 I weren't on my job.
You don't have to know the answers to the questions,

it’s fine, but if youdo it is helpful for the court to

155

know what the answer is.

Under "Business benefits” it says:

“The business, in particular the security and P&BA
departments suffer fromthe inability to interrogate its
data due to the short periods of retention ”

Now, P&BA, what is P&‘BA now called?

It is now FSC.

So that’s your department that you work in?

Yes.

And we can see that what's suggested there is “the
following areas should benefit”, "POCA claims and
disputes”. Can you tell the court what POCA is?

I don't know.

If we go down and look at "Fraud and conformance
investigations ", do you see that?

Yes.

Is that something you have ever been involved in or not?
No,

And then “SPMR contract advisors - re non-conformance
suspension hearings”.
anything like that?
No,

Have you ever been involved in

And then if we go down, just underneath "Financial
benefits” you will see:

“ARQ (audit retrieval process) costs at least 384k

I think you said earlier youdon't generally get the
ARQ data, is that right?
No.
Have you ever worked in a team where someone has sought
the ARQ data?
1 would imagine it’s when it’s the fraud team or the
security team.
Something like that?
And they need more data,
So we know that at least some reports on Credence are
now available for 24 months?

Can you just give the court an indication of some
examples of those?
It’s usually regarding the automated payment, bill

Automated bill payments?
Yes.

Yes.
Are there any others that you can think of?
Not off the top of my head.

Don't worry. It’s not Mastermind.

Now, can I ask you please to be shown (F/1120}.
This is a PEAK document about the Horizon computer
system. Do you ever see these in the course of your
work or not?

Me, no.

Does anyone in your team ever have cause to look at

a PEAK?

No.

No? Can I just ask you then —- I will take it quite
quickly, but if welook at the bottom of that first page
you will see the bottom paragraph underneath the word
“Details ”

"The customer visited Kinglassie post office .. on
13 December 2012... to deposit 1,444.20 which didn’t
credit their account. We can see from TESQA”

What's TESQA?

I've never worked on this team, but I’m aware that it’s
another system that people -- there’s more details on
that

As well?

Which is more restricted obviously for data protection
so it is only certain people that have access to that
data.

And that’s a separate system to Credence?

Yes.
“We can see from TESQA that the transaction failed at
the confirmation stage due to ‘transaction abandoned by
clerk. I've had numerous conversations with the office
and also sent out a letter and evidence but the office
has now requested a transaction log. With it being so
Jong ago they can’t provide an explanation as to why the
transaction didn't complete (but state they didn’t have
a surplus at the time of the transaetion ). If we could
ascertain what buttons were pressed by the clerk we
could go back with an explanation as to what the clerk
did with this transaction and hopefully get a conclusion
to this enquiry”

Do you see that?
Yes.
Now, it would be helpful, wouldn't it, when you have
those sorts of issues if you could identify as much
information about exactly what had happened in branch as,
possible?
I can’t answer for that particular enquiry. On cheques
we have the information that we require to investigate .
You do?
Yes.
Even if it is a long time afterwards? If someone raises

it say 102 days later for the first time?

159

If weissued a transaction correction to the office, we

put our details on there and if they had an enquiry or

dispute something they would phone the duty (inaudible)

up for more information.

But I think whathas happened here, on the face of it

and this is not a cheque case, but what appears to have

happened here is that it has been raised -- can you see

that the incident is raised on 30 August 2013?

Yes.

And it relates to a visit on 13 December 2012, do you

see that?

Yes.

So we can see that more than 90 days has elapsed from

the visit of the customer to the time when the issue has

arisen and if you looked on Credence you wouldn't be

able to see the details of the original visit, would

you, after longer than 90 days?

No,

Do you know how long you can see the details on TESQA

for?

No.

You don't. Okay.
Now, if you just go over the page at {F/1120/2}, you

see at the top of the page:

from the archives (this is required to disprove any
future claim against Horizon integrity via the clerk }

Was it your experience at all that there was any
defensiveness about the Horizon system when it was
challenged by SPMs?

If a postmaster challenged in the area that I worked in,
we always took them seriously
You did?

and we always looked at what they were actually
saying and then we would go back to our evidence of
issuing the TC.
Okay. Can we look at your paragraph 13 please (E2/8/3}
You can see there, third line:

*For example, a subpostmaster might telephone FSC
and/or the helpline and allege to Post Office that
he/she has done a reversal ”

Yes?

Yes.

That’s an SPM claiming to have done something. The way
that is expressed suggests some doubta little bit,
doesn't it, about the truth of what they're saying?

I think whatI was trying to get across in this
particular statement was if a postmaster had a query, he
could always phone us and we would try and help,

whatever his query was. That's whatI was trying to

161

explain in this.

Okay. Let's look if we may at paragraph 14, You say
there:

“In relation to Mr Coyne querying whether Credence
could contain errors that result in false TCs being
issued to branches which they cannot effectively
challenge, as I aman end user of Credence I cannot
really comment on this. However I've never heard of
a bugin Credence in my time at Post Office *

So that’s not something you are in a position to
‘comment on?

No.

Okay. Let’s move forward if we may please. Let’s look
please at {F/869}
letter for the year ended 27 March 2011 and I expect you
may not have seen that before, is that fair?

That's fair

This is an Ernst & Young management

Can we go to page 4 please {F/869/4} and just to show
you the layout of the table, the first column has

‘a number in it, the second column says Issue”, although
it is a bit strangely laid out, do you see?

Yes.

“Location”, “Background”, “Recommendation”, "Management
comment” and then the right-hand column is "Current year

update”, do you see that?

Yes.
And let's look at page 12 at point 12 please {F/869/12).
Point 12 says “Credence (back-end) change process” and
you can see there it says:

“During our walkthrough and testing of the change
control procedures for the Credence application we
became aware of the following issues

“1. Developers at Logica, the third party provider
of application development and support for Credence, had
access rights to the production environment and the
database that would permit developers to move their own
changes into the production environment,

“2. Documentation to approve fixes and patches that
are applied to Credence outside of the release process
does not always exist. We were advised by Logica
personnel that for a sample of four changes selected
evidence of approval to move into production did not
exist and that it would notbe possible to link the
changes to problem tickets to record the original
request for the fix...”

Then:

“Developers have access to move their own changes
into production and [if] documentation is not retained
to substantiate those changes there is a risk of loss of

data and application integrity due to either

163

unauthorised, erroneous or inappropriate changing made
to the production environment”

I'm not suggesting somebody read anything as
complicated as that out to you, but were you aware at
all in or around 2011 or thereafter of any concerns
about the integrity of the information on Credence?

No.

Okay. Let’s look at page 14, point 13 {F/869/14}. This
is "Credence (front end) change process” and we can see
some issues identified in the column where there is

a number 137 and in fact over on the right-hand side it

says

“Application not in audit scope for [ financial
year 11],
whether management has fully addressed our comment as

Therefore we are not able to comment on

raised in the prior year”

You didn’t see any particular changes in Credence
around 2011 or soon thereafter?
To be honest, I wasn’t working in this area in 2011
What area were you -- were you using Credence at all at
that time?
Not at that particular time, no,
You weren't, okay.

Before reading Mr Coyne’s report were you aware that

there is a time discrepancy between the Credence and the

10 A. Yes

11° MRJUSTICE FRASER: And what term should I put in there

12 instead?

13 A. Whatwe use Credence for is we have also got -- for

14 cheques is all cheques are processed at a processing
15 centre which they then create a file. So for example if
16 we had ten cheques processed we would look on Credence
17 for ten transactions that were finished off to cheques,
18 so ten versus ten and then if we've got a mismatch

19 that’s what we would be looking for. For example one
20 could be finished off to cash accidently and we would
21 try and identify that

22 MRJUSTICE FRASER: But going back to my question, what term.
23 should I put in instead of “all keystroke activity"? Is
24 there a handy or useful form of words that would correct
25 that sentence to reflect what you meant?

173

1 A. Records all transactional data performed in that branch.
2 MRJUSTICE FRASER: All transactional data performed in that

3 branch. Okay.
4 And then the next question, which is more or less on
5 the same topic, in the next paragraph you have
6 a sentence that begins at the end of line 4 which says:
7 *Weean take an initial look on Credence to see
8 whether that is correct or whether, for example, the
9 subpostmaster has in fact done an adjustment.”
10 Do you see that?
11 A. Yes.

12  MRJUSTICE FRASER: Can you just explain to me how you would
13 do that?

14 A. For example, if one of -- a postmaster phoned one of my
15 team, they might think that they have donea reversal,
16 but by the duty (inaudible) they would be able to go on
17 to Credence, download the information and look on

18 non-sales and they might have actually done an

19 adjustment.

20 MRJUSTICE FRASER: And is that something that you would be
21 involved in looking at, or would it be someone in your
22 team?

23 A. It would be my team members.

24 MRJUSTICE FRASER: And could you do that if you wanted?

25 A. If I wantedto, I could, yes.

at (E2/9/3} at paragraph 13. So you have introduced TCs
at paragraph 12
Mm-hm.
And it says:

“TCs are issued by FSC.
Post Office's solicitors that the processes by which FSC
determines whether a TC is required is outside the scope

I understand from

of the Horizonissues trial ”
Okay.

That's what you were told?
Yes.

And then you said

“Broadly, it involves FSC comparing data entered
onto Horizon by branch staff with data received from
other sources and resolving any discrepancies between
them.”

Now, pausing there, there are -- I think as we have
already heard -- separate teams for different potential
discrepancies?

Agreed.
And you have explained at paragraph 14 that

“FSC is divided into distinct teams that are
responsible for accounts relating to specific products.”
They are.

So one team might be dealing with Santander

V7

discrepancies, for example?
Indeed.

Another team might be dealing with lottery and so forth?
Absolutely.

And you say that:

“Although each team have their own responsibilities ,
there is interaction between teams to reach a final
resolution on any discrepancy ”

There is.

When would that typically occur?

That would occur when there is evidence within the
investigation that there could be a further activity
that’s needed. As an example, we have already heard
about cheques. It could be that the impact of a cheque
discrepancy could also impact on another product, so if
you have a miskey it could be that that miskey
transaction has been settled to cheque with higher than
what it should be value, but then there's also going to
be the bill payment or the actual transaction itself
that's also been at a higher value. So working together
you can put together all the pieces of the puzzle, get
the right answer and also mitigate or minimise the
impact on the branch by making sure that any corrections
that are done are done at the same time to ensure that

the financial impact is either mitigated or reduced.

1 may have happened.
2 Q. Sothere are actually reports you can use now?
3 A. Thereare reports written for those specific products.
4 Q. For those products --
5 A. Yes
6 Q. -- that exist now --
7A. Yes
8 Q. -- andare being used?
9 A. As far as I'maware, yes.
10 Q. Did you think it mightbe useful to havea look at
11 those, or did you not look at them because of what you
12 were told by the solicitors , that how it was done wasn’t
13 in scope?
14 A. Neither is accurate. These reports were generated very
15 recently. AsI say, this is a system that has been
16 developed, it is in place, but the actual uptake by
17 teams is being done ona step-by-step basis and as
18 improvements are made, reports are written. It's
19 running quite well but organically
20 Q It is fair to say that your most recent witness
21 statement is pretty recent as well, isn’t it?
22 A. It is
23° Q. 8 March.
24 A. Itis
25 Q. So you could have captured information in that witness
181
1 statement about the trends and
2 A. That wimess statement was to address specific comments
3 within there that following understanding from looking
4 at Mr Coyne’s report, relooking at my statement, which
5 is the right thing to do, it indicated that -- as per
6 Dawn Phillips’ testimony earlier that there was
7 information in there that wasn’t fully explained
8 regarding notices
9 Q Twothings, MrSmith. I know what's in the witness
10 statement. I was just pointing out that first of all
11 it’s not quite things that weren't fully explained.
12 ‘There was something in there that was wrong that you had
13 to correct. Canwe be clear about that?
14 A. Terminology, 1 will agree, was wrong.
15 Q. It was wrong?
16 A. Yes. The facts and the figures I would dispute were
17 wrong.
18 Q. Right. Well
19 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Sorry, so you are saying the facts are
20 correct and the figures are correct?
21 A. MyLord, as per Dawn's previous testimony she did say
22 that the information that she provided, the information
23 onerror notices, the volumes that she provided, were
24 accurate and that’s all that I can work on.

25  MRJUSTICE FRASER: Butif the description of what those

182

eIAHkYOnE

figures is is incorrect then you are maintaining that
the content of the statement is correct, are you?
The statement wasn’t -- it wasn’t correct, my Lord. It
was referring to error notices not transaction

corrections

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Right, Mr Green,
MR GREEN: I'm grateful

rPOoProProre

And in fact the heading in the second box, if we
look at paragraph 23 on page 5 {E2/9/S}, the heading
“Disputes received from branch” was specifically wrong,
wasn't it?

Tt was, yes.

Because it was actually “Disputes received by Santander
from PO"?

It was, yes

So that the question I was originally asking you was you
said that you didn’t include anything about the
transaction correction system or any analysis about TCs
and so forth from the system because the reports were
quite recent. I showed you the date of your statement
which was the Friday before this trial started and

I suggested that was recent. I’m just going to suggest
again that would have been an opportunity for you to put
something in about how those were working. Was there

a reason why you didn’t?

183

There wasn't.
Okay. And there aren’t any underlying documents
produced or exhibited with your statement to support
these tables, are there?

There isn’t I’m afraid

So just to get a feel for how this was done, if we look
at paragraph 17 which is (£2/9/4), "Cash bureau and
personal banking team”, the people that you spoke to or
contacted were Sarah Parkes and Gillian Hoyland, is that
right?

It was.

What did you do, did you email them, did you talk to
them, did you call them, did you meet them; what
happened?

‘There was an email that was quite explicit as to the
information I required and I did do follow up emails and
on occasion I would speak to people.

On occasion you would speak to people?

Yes.

Did you speak to Sarah Parkes?

I didn’t speak to Sarah Parkes, no.

Did you speak to Gillian Hoyland?

From memory, I did, yes.

A

If we can just go in the meanwhile to paragraph 30
of your witness statement [E2/9/6} we see a reference to
paragraph 6.66 of a report by Mr Coyne in which he
refers to two TCs of £810,000in a Post Office Limited
disclosed document and suggests they might have been
madein error. You say:

“This is not correct. Two TCs were required in this
instance because the method of payment used was cheque.”

Then:

“TCs to the value of 810,00 are directly linked and
relate to a Bank of Ireland Post Office Savings Account
deposit on 24 August 2012.”

Let's quickly look at that. It seemsto be right
If we look at {F/1195} please, Youhad a look at that
Excel spreadsheet anyway to look at the two
1 did
There's an 810 and 810at the top and the bottom, isn’t
there?

There is.

And they cancel each other out. What! wanted to ask
you about is -- while that downloads it might
download in the background if we go to another document.
Shall we just look at (D3/1/205} please. Let’s get the
spreadsheet, thank you very much.

Can we goto the original data (F/1195} and there

189

we've got a long list of individual TCs issued in 2012,
with the date they are issued, going into 2013, the
early part of 2013, so it looks like the 2012/2013-year,
is that what you understood?

I haven't seen the full detail of this report, but it
does appear that way.

And if we goto the pivot table, the pivot report tab at
the bottom we can see there are 84,217 transaction
corrections recorded there, yes?

Yes.

Could we please go to (D3/1/205}. Now, this is

Dr Worden’s report, who is the expert for Post Office,
and he has reproduced a table which was produced by
Post Office in accordance with an order that the court
made for provision of this information. When we look at
the volume of TCs in 2012 it says 124,374 and when we
look in 2013 it says 105,876 and we can see that the
moving average in that period is a lot higher than the
figure that we saw in the financial year 2012/2013. Are
you aware of any reason why the numbers in what appear
to be a calendar year might be very significantly

different , other than the fact that the financial year

arts andends at a different time?
1 know of no other difference other than it would be

significantly different based on that premise.

190

Q. Can I ask you whether you have seen this document before
please?

A. I don’t recognise it, no.
Have a look at page {H/58}. This is the documentas
originally presented and sent through. If we look at
{11/57}, you can see what's said about this. Just come
down to the third paragraph:

“Post Office does not hold historic aggregated TC
data in a single searchable database, in Horizon or
otherwise.”

We have seen that 2012 spreadsheet of all those
transaction corrections individually and for what it’s
worth I have checked that there are 87,000 of them,
Have you seen other spreadsheets of transaction
corrections similar to that for different years?

A. Similar to that, no.
‘The one we looked at which had the 810 and the 810 that
you specifically looked at to check what Mr Coyne was
saying?

A. Notin that layout, no, but Post Office do hold a
1 will loosely call it a database, it’s a SharePoint
site, with Excel spreadsheets on that have been created
to hold transaction corrections, which our -- one of the
teams within Post Office appends to daily to create that
list .

191

Q. Which departmentis in charge of that list? Who is the
owner of it? I see it is ona SharePoint site, but who
would bethe natural person to talk about that list if
they were asked?

MR JUSTICE FRASER: You have asked five questions, one after
the other.

MR GREEN: I'm sorry.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Do you want to maybe put itas one
question.

MR GREEN: Who would be the natural person to speak to that
list_and explain it?

A. It will be somebody in the systems management team.
Okay. Can I ask you whether you had any involvement in
or about May 2018 in looking at any of those sorts of
documents to compile a table of how many transaction
corrections there had been?

A. It’s possible. I cannot explicitly remember, but
I could have.

Q. You can’t remember?

No, not at this stage.

>

Q. Can we just look at (F/889}, which is my missed note.
Can we look please at the "Branch type volume” tab
please and you can see there's an analysis. of
transaction corrections by branch type, yes?

AL Yes

is that this is the information that I have gained from
team leaders, it would be disputes regarding transaction
corrections that have been received by branch.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: But your paragraph 16 is talking about
the sense of proportion of TCs that have been challenged
and what challenges were successful.

A. I'm specifically

MR JUSTICE FRASER: So the one or two disputes a month are
back in respect of TCs that have been issued, is that
right?

A. That is my assumption, yes, my Lord.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And that would be as a proportion of,
what higher number, or any idea, or you can’t remember,
or you were never told?

A. I'm unaware of the number, my Lord.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Unaware. All right, that’s very
helpful, thank you.

Mr De Garr Robinson, anything? No.

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: My Lord, no questions.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Mr Smith, that’s your evidence done so
thank you very much, You don’t have to come back
tomorrow. Obviously you are welcome to but you don't
have to come back to give evidence. ‘Thank you very
much.

Anything that needs dealing with?

197

Can I just raise a polite reminder about experts’
reports cross-referenced to the Opus - when! mentioned
it last week it wasn’t urgent. It is still not urgent
but I would broadly like them by the end of the week if
possible.

And then I was also going to havea file of PEAKs
and KELs.

MR GREEN: My Lord, do you want us to give it to you as we
go along?

MR JUSTICE FRASER: I think so, yes please

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: It would be helpful if all parties
could have the same file.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Lagree, but I don't suppose the
claimants necessarily know which ones you are going to
use when you are cross examining Mr Coyne.

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: No, no, absolutely.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: I would have thought the task of

providing one by the end of the week for the evidence of

fact is probably going to be fairly straightforward,
because we haven't been using very many.

MR GREEN: My Lord, yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And then after that it can be updated
every couple of days. And it doesn’t have to be updated
hefore they are asked questions, it can be updated

afterwards. It’s just to give mea useful working file.

1 Right, anything else?

2. MR DEGARR ROBINSON: My Lord, no.

3. MRJUSTICE FRASER: No. 10.30 tomorrow. Thank you very
4 much,
