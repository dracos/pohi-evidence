Chris,

Thanks very much for this clear update.

One thing puzzled me. I thought we had agreed that we would reduce the rates we were paying SS (it was one of the
items on the menu of options under Option 2)? All the things reported in relation to SS are good - well done everyone -
but the level of their fees is not mentioned. Why is that?

Dear All

After the Board meeting on the eve of your away day I thought it would be helpful to send an update setting out
the progress of the cases under the scheme, recent developments with the Working Group, and the reforms to
the Scheme's operation

Kind Regard

Chris
