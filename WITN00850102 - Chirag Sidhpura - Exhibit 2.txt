Background to Case

Details of what has happened eg reasons for precautionary suspension or

immediate termination.

Mr Sidhpura was originally appointed as Subpostmaster on 22 January 2013. The
branch converted on site to a Local Plus model on 14 August 2015.

An audit took place at the branch on 10 October 2017, due to concerns over failed
cash declarations and repeated failures to return excess cash, which resulted in a
shortage of £57543.92 being revealed.

V2GC130617

WITN00850102
A breakdown of the shortage is as follows:

£

Cash 57297.54 | shortage |
Foreign Exchange 8.85 | surplus
Postage 16.53 | surplus
Stock 274.63 | shortage
Spoilt Postage Labels 12.65 | shortage
Late transactions 15.52 | surplus
Total 57543.92 | shortage

The identified cash shortage was found within the ATM stock unit figures,
No explanation was provided for the cash shortages at the audit.
Following the audit, the father in law of the postmaster repaid the total amount of

the loss on 12 October 2017 and as a result no monies are outstanding to Post
Office Ltd.

Breaches Identified

Investigation

Details of investigations undertaken (all areas where investigations have been
undertaken and details of information obtained eg findings from RTU/meeting with
PMR).

Background

Farncombe is a loca branch situated in a convenience store within a large village
in Surrey. Mr Sidhpura acquired the store in January 2013 under a traditional
contract and converted to a Local Plus branch in August 2015. Customer sessions
are approximately 1150 per week. There is no record of any contractual action
relating to the branch stored on cloud city.

1 wrote to Mr Sidhpura on 6 November 2017 inviting him to attend a meeting on
15 November 2017. Mr Sidhpura confirmed on the 9 November that he would be
attending the meeting unaccompanied. However on arrival at the meeting, Mr
Sidhpura arrived with [aaa from the NFSP. Prior to this meeting, Mr
Sidhpura had already been interviewed by =e from the security team.

Before the date of the meeting, I contacted (gammy from the SSRT and
asked him to review the transaction history and balancing of the branch to see if
any useful information could be obtained that would assist with this enquiry. It
was agreed that it would assist further to obtain the ARQ data for the period
before and after the branch closure in August 2015.

Informal Meeting

Mr Sidhpura works full time in the business and is supported by 2 other part time

V2GC130617

WITNO0850102
members of staff. Up until the day of the audit, he also employed ay

that were apparently unrelated to the loss at the branch. Mr Sidhpura stated that
until this point, both he and his brother in law were responsible for balancing the
ATM at the branch. The ATM was installed at the branch during August 2013.

Mr Sidhpura claimed that he was not aware of any shortage in relation to the ATM
prior to the audit being conducted on 10 October 2017. He informed me that he
had checked the ATM balancing regularly, but not in the week preceding the audit,
due to having lost the ATM keys. These were apparently then found in one of the
safes on the premises. He further stated that the branch balanced without any
significant shortages and that he was responsible for completing the office balance
procedure. Mr Sidhpura also added that the ATM figures were correct up to the
point that the keys were missing for 1 week.

During the meeting, Mr Sidhpura suggested initially, that the reason for the
shortage could be related to not declaring the ATM figures during the time the
branch was closed for two weeks while the refurbishment to a Local mode! was
completed. This was the 2 week period at the beginning of August 2015.However,
later in the meeting, he suggested that it was as a result of the way in which he
recorded and entered the ATM figures onto Horizon. This suggestion was refuted
by ME from NFSP, as he indicated that this would have shown a discrepancy
each week, At no point during the meeting was Mr Sidhpura able to offer a
satisfactory explanation as to why the loss had occurred, but he maintained that
he could not understand what had happened and that it was a shock to him. He
added that the loss had been repaid in full via his father in law two days after the
audit had taken place. Mr Sidhpura stated that the loss was not an issue with the
Horizon system.

During the meeting, I requested that Mr Sidhpura provided me with the branch
ATM reports 1 and 2 and the relevant Horizon receipts. This was agreed by him
and I provided Mr Sidhpura with the address to send the documents to.

The week following the meeting with Mr Sidhpura, I received a significant amount
of documentation from him as per my request. This was forwarded to

, in order that this could be reviewed and cross referenced with the
information held by him.

Additional Meeting

I was subsequently contacted by Mr Sidhpura on 4 December 2017 at which time
he requested a further meeting with me. He stated that he had been reviewing his
method of ATM accounting with another postmaster and he believed he could
demonstrate how the loss had occurred. As I had very limited time available prior
to Christmas, I agreed to meet with Mr Sidhpura the following day in Norwich.

At this meeting, I was shown a spreadsheet of his review and the figures he
purported were the reason for the loss occurring at the branch. He verbally gave
me the reasons for this and his method for reporting the ATM figures. I suggested
that he put all of his explanations in writing together with his spreadsheet and
email it to me, in order that a review could be undertaken. I received the
documents from Mr Sidhpura on 11 December 2017 and immediately forwarded
them to SM to assist with his review.

Calls to NBSC

A total of only 2 related calls were made to NBSC prior to the audit on 10 October;

V2GC130617

WITNO0850102
e 14 August 2015 regarding office balance snapshot querying the amount of
cash shown as on hand. Advised to continue to contact the cash
management team. There is no record available that details a call to the
CASM Team. This call was made by gage, Post office Trainer.

e 18 August 2015 regarding the ATM telephone number. No other
information is available.

® In total 27 calls were made to NBSC, of which 9 were made by Mr
Sidhpura.

Support Services Resolution Team Report

A report was requested from [iigagaemmgeemesy from SSRT and is associated with this
document. The key findings of his investigation are as follows.

e Ahigh volume of failed cash declarations showing that the daily process of
declaring cash on hand at the branch were not completed.

e Clear evidence that repeated requests to return excess cash to Post Office
Ltd were ignored completely. In other instances the amount returned was
significantly lower than the amount requested. Failure to return cash as
requested occurred throughout the period reviewed from 14 August 2016
until 9 October 2017.

e The ATM cash holdings are high relative to the weekly average dispensed
figures.

e Due to the failure to comply with the above, there were certain occasions
when requests for extra cash made by Mr Sidhpura were refused.

e The ATM figures for the period the branch was closed in August 2015 were
entered onto Horizon on 19 August, despite the postmaster initially
claiming they had not been.

e There is clear evidence that the branch stock units were being manipulated
in an attempt to show a zero discrepancy. Two periods of trading have
been reviewed, 01 July 2015 to 30 September 2015 and 06 June 2017 to
10 October 2017. SSRT have provided exampies and commented this is a
genera! trend through the period reviewed.

2 On 6 October 2017 a multiple sale of stamps totalling £668.90, paid by Visa
credit payment is reversed approximately four and a half hours later and
settled to cash. (If a genuine transaction, the customer should have been
refunded by the Visa credit payment. If not a genuine transaction, it is a
means of obtaining instant cash). This matter has not been discussed with
the postmaster, as it was unknown at the time of the informal meeting.

e No evidence to support the claim of the postmaster that the loss had
occurred after the last Branch Trading Statement, prior to the audit on 10
October.

e The review of the information supplied by Mr Sidhpura is incorrect and does
not explain the loss found at the audit. Using the figures he provided, it
would actually have resulted in a surplus of £17,245.00.

° Itis apparent that Mr Sidhpura did not follow the Post Office Accounting
Instructions for BOI ATM, which is supplied to all branches.

Security Report

On 20 December 2017 a case closure report was received from Post Office
Security. The report stated the following:

e Mr Sidhpura stated that he had no idea how the ATM loss had occurred, but
suggested that it may have occurred during the time the branch was closed
in August 2015.

V2GC130617

WITNO0850102
« Subsequently suggested that he must have been balancing the ATM
incorrectly.
* Mr Sidhpura was challenged on whether he had been making false
declarations on his branch trading statements, which he denied.
The conclusion of the Security case is that no criminal action will be taken against
Mr Sidhpura.

On appointment, onsite training took place on 22 January 2013 to 28 January
2013 and also 30 January 2013. Mr Sidhpura confirmed at our meeting that he
received training on appointment. There is a record dated 18 August 2015, which
show that at the conversion to the local model, further training was given and
signed off by Mr Sidhpura. This shows that the areas relating to making good
losses, cash management (ONCH) and remittances were covered within the
training provided.

Details of previous performance issues and action taken

Although it was evident that Mr Sidhpura had consistently failed to complete his
daily cash declarations, or return cash as requested over a long period of time,
this matter does not appear to have been referred to the contracts team for action
to be taken. The initial training records for the operator do not appear within the
training link spreadsheet.

Findings Against Each Breach and Factors for Consideration

Detail information Identified from the investigation against each breach of the
Contractual Agreement/Contract for Services/manual (insert contractual clause
and information to demonstrate the breach). Include any new breaches identified
as a result of the investigation.

Clause 3.6.3 of Part 2 of Standard Conditions

The audit revealed a shortage at the branch of £57543.92, the bulk of which
related to the ATM. Mr Sidhpura has not provided any satisfactory explanation for
the loss and any reasons given by him have subsequently been disproved. He has
suggested different reasons for the shortage, which have proven to be false and
has stated that he was the person who completed the balancing of the ATM and
the branch as a whole. Mr Sidhpura has failed to keep the accounts In the
prescribed manner and failed to undertake cash declarations as required, resulting
in an unexplained shortage. This is a breach of clause 3.6.3 of Part 2 of the
Standard Conditions of the Agreement.

Clause 3.7.3-Cash Holdings

Over a significant period cash holdings were greatly in excess of limits as detailed
in the CASM report and requests to return excess cash ignored. This is a breach of
clause 3.7.3 of Part 2 of the Standard Conditions.

Clause 4.1-Immediate repayment of shortages

The shortage identified at the audit on 10 October could not be made good
immediately. This is a breach of 4.1 of Part 2 of the Standard Conditions.

In addition to the above breaches section 16.2 and in particular clause 16.2.15 of
Part 2 of the Standard Conditions of the Agreement states POL has the rights to

V2GC130617

WITNO0850102
terminate the Agreement in the event of failing to properly account for Post Office
funds and failing to repay shortages.

Criteria for Consideration

o Impact and on-going risk to POL funds

The audit revealed a shortage of £57543.92 which has been repaid in full.
However reinstatement would present a continued ongoing risk to PO funds, as
there has been no satisfactory explanation for the loss and Mr Sidhpura has
indicated that his business is struggling financially. In addition he has to repay his
father in law the full amount of the loss, as it was him who repaid the monies
owed to Post Office Ltd. There is a major concern regarding Post Office monies
given his financial situation.

oe Impact and on-going risk to POL brand and reputation

Reinstatement would be a risk to Post Office Ltd brand and reputation due to
continued risk to funds, which could lead to further issues occurring and a loss of
service thus damaging the business brand and reputation.

“o Effect of termination on customers
The branch is currently closed and customers are having to use other branches.
The 3 nearest branches are
e Godalming 1.0 miles
e Shalford 2.5 miles

e Milford 3.0 miles

o Effect of termination on the Postmaster

Mr Sidhpura indicated both at the meeting with me and in subsequent telephone
calls that the retail business is struggling and I believe that without the Post
Office, he will struggle to maintain his current business without looking for
different sources of income.

o Any relevant information provided by the Postmaster including any ~

mitigation presented

Mr Sidhpura has stated that he would change the way in which he accounts for the
ATM figures. However, he should have been following the correct process anyway
and he is now in a position of financial difficulty.

o Direct involvement or responsibility of the Agent in the actions
which led to the breach

Mr Sidhpura has not provided a satisfactory explanation for the shortages
identified at the branch. He has repeatedly failed to complete his daily cash
declarations or return excess cash as required leading to the breaches of his
contract.

V2GC 130617

WITNO0850102
o Impact of the breach (as distinct from the proposed termination) on
customers, suppliers and partner

The branch has remained closed since the audit causing disruption for the
customers and loss of income and brand damage to Post Office Ltd.

o Identity of the injured party (if any) who has suffered loss or
damage as a result of the breach, and whether this party is POL,
customers or clients

The loss has been repaid to Post Office Ltd. Customers have suffered the
inconvenience of the branch being closed and Post Office Ltd have suffered brand
damage.

o Postmaster's history |.e. service length and record, previous written
directions/warnings etc.

Mr Sidhpura was originally appointed as Subpostmaster on 8 January 2013. The
branch converted to a Local Plus on 14 August 2015. There have been no
contractual matters recorded against the postmaster since his appointment.

o Legal advice

No legal advice required.

Factors in Favour of Postmaster

No previous contractual issues recorded.

Loss repaid in full.

Blwlry|e

Factors Against Postmaster

an

Audit conducted at branch resulted in an unexplained shortage of
£57543.92.

Repeated failure to declare the branch overnight cash holdings.

win

Repeated failure to return excess cash as required, which is in breach of the
contract.

4 Differing explanations for the loss, which have since been disapproved.

5 Concern in relation to reversal of postage transaction to cash.

Decision and rationale

Recommended Decision:

Immediate termination of the Postmasters Agreement

Rationale to support recommended decision |.e. why have you recommended
this course of action and excluded others based on the balance of
probabilities?

Following consideration of all of the available facts for this case, I
recommend immediate termination for the following reasons:

1. The significant amount of the shortage in a relatively small branch, for
which Mr Sidhpura has offered no satisfactory explanation. The two
different reasons given by him have both been proved to be false.

V2GC130617

WITNO0850102
WITNO0850102

2, The investigation has established that Mr Sidhpura regularly failed to
declare his overnight cash holdings.

3. As part of this process, he also failed on many occasions to return
excess cash as required and this is a clear breach of his contract.

4. There is evidence of a stamp reversal transaction that was settled to
cash, over 4 hours after the original transaction concerning an.
amount of £668.90.The purchase was made via a Visa Credit
payment.

5. Mr Sidhpura has stated on more than one occasion that his retail
business is struggling financially and he also has the debt of over
£57000.00 to repay to his father in law.

I have considered but ruled out reinstatement due to the following reasons:

- No satisfactory explanation has been provided by Mr Sidhpura for how
the shortage occurred. If the Postmaster were allowed to operate the
branch again a continued risk to Post Office funds would exist,
particularly given his financial situation.

The lengthy period of time that he failed to complete his overnight
cash declarations.

- The failures to return excess cash as required under the terms of his
contract.

I have considered but ruled out suspended termination due to:

- The ongoing risk to Post Office funds because of the absence of a
proper explanation from Mr Sidhpura for the shortage found at audit
and his current financial situation.

- Evidence shows that Mr Sidhpura fails consistently to complete basic
Post Office processes, such as declaring cash declarations.

- Failure to meet the requirements to return excess cash as dictated by
his contract.

I have considered but ruled out termination by notice due to the following:

- The ongoing risk to Post Office funds.

- The branch has been closed since 10 October and it would lead to
major brand damage to reopen for a short period of time and then
close it again.

Which occurred on your Bank of Irelan atm 23.09.2017. When these occur
The customer's account is debited but no monies are dispensed remaining
Inside the atm which should results in a surplus in the Boi atm weekly
Balance. Your weekly balance 27.09.17 did not show the surplus but there
Is £200 difference between dispensed since joad and atm total which verifies
Failures occurred whereby customers’ monies never left the cassettes and
Would be included in the remaining cash. There must be an error within the
Balance that prevented the correct surplus showing.
