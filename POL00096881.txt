Gareth,

Could you take a look at the attached emails; as you will see, the matter is sensitive.

| have a very clear view on Lesley’s question regarding the possibility of a network fault causing such
discrepancies over such a long period; however, you have far more knowledge and experience than me. What
do you think?

Regards,

Stephen

Stephen

Can you please help with this issue - it is obviously quite sensitive.

The branch has had issues over a period of months and the engineer has just found a fault on the line. We would
like a view on whether or not this type of fault would cause an issue of this nature - as you will see from the

email that this is to the tune of 18k.

Angela is leading the investigation from Post Office and I would be grateful if one of your team could contact
her directly.

I realise that this is probably outside of the usual process but there is a nervousness around this one and the fact
that the branch now believe that the cause has been found.

Andy: I have copied you in with my absence next week and Simons. Simon will pick up when he's back.
Regards Lesley

Simon,

I’m sending this to you at this stage so that this is on the radar. As I’ve said in the note below we need to
understand this properly before we jump to any conclusions; I’ve left Lesley a voicemail as I want to get
her view on the engineer’s findings and what further work we need to do in respect of Horizon.

Thanks,
Angela

Lin,

Thave not (to my knowledge) been made aware of this branch previously and their ongoing claims that
discrepancies incurred were as a result of the Horizon system. The content of the e-mail chain below has
the potential to set the hares running before we properly understand what has gone on here and what the
potential consequences are. Therefore can I have as a matter of urgency the background on this branch,
including the balancing records since the agent was appointed; TCs; NBSC and Horizon helpline logs and
all associated correspondence. I will flag this to the JFSA working group and in particular raise with
Lesley Sewell in relation to the Horizon system.

Thanks,
Angela

Hi

This branch has been reporting losses for approximately 18 months and has always claimed it
was due to the Horizon system.

Today John Seymore, a Fujitsu Engineer, visited the branch today and found a problem with the
Broadband which meant it was on a continuous loop.

When | spoke to him he explained that this could be caused by the ADSL plate and/or cable
which he replaced or the Paystation. He also said that this could mean that transactions are not
going through the system properly.

Please could you look into this case for me. | need to know what the impact of this fault is and
whether it would generate losses in the branch.

If these losses are found to be due to this fault, what would the position be regarding
reimbursing the problem.

Regards
Anita

Hi Anita — | rang the PM, Jane, at Semilong PO this morning just as an engineer had
arrived at her branch. She explained that she has had an ongoing problem with
discrepancies at her branch for the last 18 months and you were aware of the situation.
She said yesterday on Position 3 there was less than £1000 working cash. The clerk did
a balance snapshot and was £170 over — she immediately did a printout and it was then
showing as £700 under. So she knows there is a fault on the Horizon system. | agreed |
would ring her back at 1.00pm to see what the engineer had found out.

| have just rang Jane back and she was so happy she said she could cry with relief. The
engineer said there is a definite fault on the line — there was a bad noise on the line and
this was probably causing a ‘loop’ — he said it may be caused by her Paystation. He
has changed the faceplate and the ADCL cable and is hoping this solves the problem.
Horizon Team will now keep an eye on it and may ring her to tell her to disconnect her
Paystation and then send her a new one.

She has always known that the TC’s were not hers but has always settled centrally -a
total of approximately £18,000.00 over the last 18 months — she has even had to cash
in her pension to pay these off and now is asking for this money back.

Can you advise how we go about seeing how much money this lady is due back please
