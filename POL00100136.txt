Subject: Further briefing for tomorrow

Alice, Paula,
Please find attached is further briefing from Chris following a phone call from lan Henderson.

Also attached a draft agenda that James has sent through after seeing ours, I suggest we ask to take
business improvement first at the start of the meeting as this sets the tone for our wider engagement.

There are some further bullet points below setting out a proposed response to the past cases issue:

e Cartwright King have reviewed past cases in line with a process that has been by endorsed by
leading Counsel.

e 325 individuals cases were reviewed to see if any issues arising out of the Second Sight review
ought to be disclosed to the defence in accordance with our duties as a prosecutor.

e Further disclosure was provided in 21 cases.

e It is up to the defence in cases where disclosure has been provided to review the material and
take any appropriate action in the interests of their client.

e Thus far no convicted defendant has sought the leave of the Court of Appeal to challenge his
conviction; this may of course change.

¢ Post Office is still confident that we have not seen an unsafe conviction. We continue to
keep this matter under constant review as the Second Sight work and Post Office’s own
investigations into the complaints continue.

e All 147 applications (including those with a criminal conviction) are being overseen by a
former Criminal Court of Appeal Judge Sir Anthony Hooper.

Regards

David
