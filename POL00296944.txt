Subject: Latest on SS

Hi Alice, I'm looking forward to catching up properly tomorrow. I thought the Board were generous in their patience
tonight over the SS discussion. It is helpful to know that they are supportive of the need to be robust. That said, I thought
Alasdair's intervention was good - it is why we haven't been completely heavy handed yet. We can discuss nuances and
next steps tomorrow.

I caught up with Susan this evening after we finished. She had finished her meeting with SS and wade of the view that
they do now understand the risk of being caught up in something bigger and more sensitive. She is hoping their report
should be more balanced, should say they have found no evidence of systemic Horizon (computer) issues but will
confirm shortcomings in support processes and systems, and that Post Office has already identified and corrected a
number of these. I hope when they speak to James tomorrow that they will confirm all this. They will also want to say
their work is not finished and therefore still not conclusive.

Not a final position by any means nor one that controls what they might say rather than write but sounding slightly better.

Rest assured there will be a thorough lessons learnt exercise, which if you are comfortable, I'd like to suggest reports to
the ARC. As you said tonight, we need to get through this first though.

Paula
