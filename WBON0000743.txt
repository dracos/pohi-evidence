Rodric
Just to confirm, Andy Pheasant is around to proof the witness on SR5.

FYI - we're disappearing into a team meeting from 12-1:30 (it's our first merged firm wide meeting so we're being
“encouraged” to attend!). If you need anything urgently, please call my blackberry (number below).

Kind regards
Andy
