Imogen,

14 and 15 June are not suitable. Dr Worden is available on 21 and 22 June and during the week commencing 25
June. We have asked Fujitsu to confirm whether any of those dates are suitable. In the meantime, please let me
know if any of them are not suitable for Mr Coyne.

Regards

Jonny

I’ve just tried to give you a call on the below - our expert is not able to keep both of those days free for much
longer (particularly not the Thursday). Can you please confirm the position ASAP. Given the limited time

available, I can take instructions on there being one day of access on Friday, and a further one the following
week if that is more suitable for both experts/Fujitsu.

Thanks

Imogen

As you know, the Judge made an order in relation to the experts having 2 days access to the PEAK/TFS
system by next Friday 15 June.

The Claimants’ expert is available on Thursday 14" and Friday 15"" June for the inspection. Is this suitable
for Dr Worden and is Fujitsu able to accommodate this?

Thanks

Imogen
