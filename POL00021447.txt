Group Litigation

CN advised that the audit work on Group Litigation would be completed as late as possible
due to the continued movement in the situation and the associated disclosure.

It was noted that it was difficult to provide a reliable estimate for a provision at present
because the claimants had not formalised claims. Management agreed to support PwC to

seek, in writing, from legal counsel, the reasons that POL was currently unable to providea BF
reliable estimate.
