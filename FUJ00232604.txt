SVM/SDM/SD/0017 Security Service Description

2 _ISMS Objectives

The objectives of the ISMS are to:

e Provide a security framework within which the Service is developed, implemented and delivered
by Fujitsu in all areas of its business and responsibilities as required under Schedules A4:4.1.2
of the Agreement which states that ‘Fujitsu services shall be in compliant with ISO 27001’.

e Provide an organisational and responsibility framework for security activities within Fujitsu and
allocate security roles and responsibilities

e Identify risks associated with the provision of the Service, through formal risk assessment
techniques, and prioritise and implement appropriate controls and security measures

e Ensure appropriate security and business continuity procedures and controls are in place to
support Services provided by Fujitsu

e Provide a basis for review, governance, assessment and improvement of the ISMS

e Ensure that information security controls are appropriate to the sensitivity of the information
processed and stored

e Identify the security awareness and education requirements for all Fujitsu RMGA employees and
subcontractors

e Describe the compliance, audit and management arrangements

3 Scope of the Fujitsu Services RMGA ISMS

The Fujitsu Services RMGA ISMS encompasses all aspects of the Fujitsu Services RMGA business and
operations in support of discharging Service obligations as defined in the Agreement.

This ISMS is a subset of the RMGA Business Management System (BMS) as described in the BMS
Implementation Approach (PGMPASMANO004)

This includes the design, development, testing, deployment, operation, maintenance, decommissioning
and Services transfer of all aspects of the Services provided to Post Office Limited as well as the
associated supporting Fujitsu Services RMGA business processes.

A distinct part of the scope of this ISMS is subject to ISO27001 registration, specifically the design,
development, test and deployment processes including the delivery, operation and maintenance of the
HNGxX Service. The document “ISMS Scope” (SVM/SEC/MAN/0002) describes the full scope of the
ISMS subject to registration, in terms of technology, people and process.

3.1 Fujitsu Group Security

The Physical Security of Fujitsu Services sites are provided by Fujitsu Group Security. Any requirements
that RMGA has for additional security is requested by the CISO or Operational Security Manager from
the Head of Group Security.

Information about incidents affecting the physical security of Fujitsu Services RMGA sites are provided
to the Operational Security Manager by Group Security.

Commercial in Confidence

Group Security also has responsibility for the vetting procedures for Fujitsu Services RMGA staff
although local advice and guidance can be obtained from the RMGA operational security team.

3.2 Fujitsu Corporate Information Systems

The information security of Fujitsu Corporate Information Systems is managed by Fujitsu Corporate
Information Services and their use is subject to the Fujitsu Services Security Master Policy (CPM/20).

3.3 Infrastructure Services

Infrastructure Services provide some elements of the Services to RMGA and are bound to comply with
the RMGA Information Security Policy. However, Infrastructure Services operate their own 1SO27001
registered ISMS with which this ISMS interfaces.

4 Risk Management

Fujitsu Services has an approved approach to the management of information security risk for RMGA
which is documented in RMGA Information Risk Management Approach.

Fujitsu Services RMGA is required to conduct a robust programme of risk management (incorporating
risk identification, assessment and mitigation) as a means of determining and confirming the
appropriateness of information related security controls for Programme systems and services. The risk
management programme is, on a day-to-day basis, undertaken by the Fujitsu Services RMGA IG staff.
Although the options for risk management (i.e. acceptance, transfer, mitigation etc) are determined by
the IG staff and the decision taken by the appropriate Programme or Operational management team,
security risk oversight lies with the Information Security Management Review Body (ISMR) , which is the
highest authority within the Fujitsu Services RMGA for the management of information security risks.
Further information about the ISMR is contained later in this document.

4.1 Methodology and Tool
Fujitsu Services RMGA employs a repeatable risk based approach comprising:

the identification of key assets and service components;

the threats they may be subject to;

an assessment of the range of impacts upon the systems and service, and;

the recommendation of proposed controls or countermeasures, aimed at;

allowing management to make appropriate decisions on risk management, by selecting the most
relevant control options

The risk assessment methodology and software tool, FRAMES (Version 0.9) is the preferred approach
for the assessment of information security risks for RMGA. FRAMES is a risk assessment tool based on
the ISF SPRINT Methodology, developed in Microsoft Access. It has been designed to carry out
Assessments of Risks associated with Information Assets, ranging from applications to data centres. It is
intended to be used in a workshop environment where participants can identify impacts, threats, and any
necessary controls.

4.2 Risk Assessment

FUJITSU System (ISMS) Manual

Commercial in Confidence

Risk assessment and management is not a one-off exercise, with a single set of control
recommendations which remain static in time. In the ongoing processes concerned with Programme
releases, operational delivery and maintenance of the live service, there will be a number of instances
where information risk assessment activity will be necessary:

e Planned risk assessments — these will be part of the normal routine for ensuring that deployed
controls remain relevant to the threat environment in which the systems and service operate, as
the prevailing threats and vulnerabilities may change over time. This refresh would fall within the
‘Check’ phase of the ‘Plan — Do — Check — Act’ control implementation cycle. It may be
necessary therefore to conduct risk assessment activity either at planned intervals (e.g. 6-
monthly or annual) to confirm that controls are still relevant, or to carry out a risk review on
specific components of the service or infrastructure where assurance as to the continued
effectiveness of controls is required.

* Reactive risk assessments — As part of service management, incidents, issues or threat
notifications may indicate a need for a reactive review of the potential impact of particular
threats or new vulnerabilities. This may be as a result of a single serious incident or as an
escalating or cumulative trend. The objective of this review may be to verify if existing controls
are sufficient to deal with the new or escalating threats/vulnerabilities, or require strengthening.

4.3 Risk Treatment Plan

In accordance with the dictates of best practice, RMGA maintains a Risk Treatment Plan (RTP)
(Information Security Risk Treatment Plan)

Information risks are recorded in the Fujitsu Services RMGA RTP. Risks attracting high probability and
impact scores are escalated, as required, through the Fujitsu Services RMGA risk management process
(PGM/PAS/MAN/0002)

In addition to regular risk assessments, RTP sources are:

* ISO/IEC27001 Compliance Rating
Each month Fujitsu Services RMGA reports a compliance status, in terms of all 15027001
control items. Any area with a score of ‘0’ (control not addressed) is recorded in the RTP.

* Audit Non-Conformity Notices (NCN), Observations and Improvements

Regular Information Security Policy (ISP) compliance audits are conducted. During the audits,
inappropriate controls, or controls improperly implemented, may be identified and, subsequently,
an ‘NCN’, ‘Observation’ or ‘Improvement Opportunity’ is raised.

An ‘NCN’ is raised where a mandatory control (as defined in the Agreement or ISP) is not
addressed or is ineffectively implemented, and this fact is recorded in the RTP.

An ‘Observation’ is raised when a recommended control (as defined in the Control Framework) is
not effectively implemented

An ‘Improvement Opportunity’ record is raised when a control is implemented but there is an
opportunity for improvement in the management system

* Supplementary

There are information risks identified by, or notified to, the IG staff and subsequently registered,
often as a result of:

o Specific risk workshops, organised for the purpose
o Information risks generated by other teams across the account
o Other compliance and testing activities, which give rise to potential risks requiring

mediation

o Service incidents which have the potential to cause significant impact, and for which a
review of the risk and control position is required

5 ISMS STRUCTURE FOR RMG ACCOUNT

The ISMS is founded on the basic concepts of: Confidentiality; Integrity; Availability. Information
Governance staff ensure the co-ordination of all physical protective and logical information security
aspects of the premises, facilities, infrastructure and data; and ensure compliance with all Security
Controls, and the Security Policy.

However, the ISMS also outlines the management responsibility for ongoing Operational Security of
operational Services, including ensuring that the security section in SLAs, OLAs are compliant with, and
that Business Continuity plans support the Security Policy and Security Controls. These key operational
responsibilities are outlined in section 8.

5.1 Statement of Applicability

Information security is implemented through an appropriate set of controls, which in practice will be a
combination of policies, procedures, organisational structures, physical and technical measures.

The selected controls are documented in the Fujitsu Services RMGA Statement of Applicability. Most of
the controls are applicable and controls are only excluded where they are outside of the scope or not
identified as a risk to the Service delivered to POL.

5.2 Document and Record Management

The RMGA Dimensions system ensures that all documents are readily available from a single source, to
the relevant audience.

The Statement of Applicability (SOA) lists all documents relevant to the scope of the ISMS. The SOA
can be found in Dimensions.

All documents required by the Fujitsu Services RMGA ISMS are protected and controlled through the
RMGA HNG-X Document Control Process (PGM/DCM/PRO/0001). The document process also contains
details about document branding, protective marking, document retention and quality templates.

Records are established and maintained to provide evidence of conformity to requirements and the
effective operation of the Fujitsu Services RMGA ISMS. The primary records are:

6 Compliance and Reporting

6.1 18027001 Compliance Audits

In support of the IS027001 compliance requirements, and to provide ongoing assurance of compliance,
regular compliance audits will be conducted. As directed by the Chief Information Security Officer, the
scope and terms of reference for each of these audits will be determined in advance and agreed with the
manager of the area(s) to be audited.

For each 1S027001 control within the scope of the ISMS the following is reviewed:

e Clear, accepted responsibility for the aspect of Information Security which is subject to that
control;

e Confirmation from the organisation that the relevant control is in place, documented and
effective;

e Documentary evidence (records/logs etc. in either electronic or hardcopy format), which can
be inspected to confirm the controls are in place and functioning as intended. Inspection is
on a sampling basis.

e All findings are logged on the Fujitsu Services Assessment Database and updated as action
is taken.

All audits will be carried out by suitably trained auditors with auditing qualifications e.g.
BS7799/ISO27001 Lead Auditor; TickIT Auditor/Lead Auditor.

Audits are carried out as part of the RMGA Internal Audit Plan (PGM/PAS/PLA/0005). Additional audits
are carried out on a regular basis by the FS Manage Information Security Process Champion and Fujitsu
Services Business Assurance. As part of 1S027001 registration, independent external audits will be
conducted as determined by the audit body.
