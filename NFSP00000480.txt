B) MATTERS ARISING FROM THE REPORTS I

1. POST OFFICE BOARD - PO BD

The GENERAL SECRETARY gave a report of his recent meeting with Dr.
Neville Bain, Chairman of The Post Office. Five common issues had been
discussed:- the Future of the Post Office; the Future of Horizon; Counters
Business; Minimum Wage and the Working Time Directive; and the Size
and Shape of the Network. In addition the Federation had Mailwork; and
what the Corporation were doing for the various businesses, whilst Security;
and Signage and Presentation were put forward by Dr. Bain. It was stressed
by him that he was purely a non-Executive Chairman, and that he could make
no recommendations or promises.

All the above issues were covered during the course of the meeting, although
it became evident that Dr. Bain had no knowledge of Mailwork with regard to
its particular impact on sub post offices. He expressed deep concern
regarding security and undertook to investigate the question of the £40
million, of which he was unaware. With regard to signage and presentation,
Dr. Bain indicated his desire to work with the Federation in an attempt to
improve the substantial differences which existed between sub offices. As to
the size and shape of the Network, it was Dr. Bain’s opinion that very shortly,
the picture should be nich clearer although he considered that the urban

network would be addressed as opposed to the rural one, which was self
regulating. A serious look needed to be taken at the subject.

A good working relationship had been established which it was anticipated
would be continued.

Irrelevant

- THE POST OFFICE INQUIRY

There was little to report on the subject stated the GENERAL SECRETARY,
although the result of the Inquiry might be to hand somewhat earlier than had
originally been expected.

6. HUMAN RESOURCES
6(a) TRAINING FOR SUBPOSTMASTERS

Although not on the Agenda, MR. PEBERDY wished to raise the issue of
Transactional Knowledge training and referred to a trial in the Midlands Region.
The Royal Mail session was excellent and well received. However, that
conducted by POCL regarding Insurance Products did not meet expectations.

It was the GENERAL SECRETARY’s view that information be sought from
Sub-Postmasters in order that difficulties could be addressed.

The CHAIRMAN highlighted concerns with regard to pre-appointment
training, particularly where Regional General Managers were insistent the
Sub-Postmasters attend for four weeks without any pay whatsoever. If, at the
end of such training, a Sub-Postmaster had not reached the required
standard, his Contract was under threat.

MRS. KENDALL concurred pointing out there were occasions in the North
East when, following a new appointment, due to a lack of qualified trainers,

training could not be carried out in the prescribed time period. The whole

situation would be addressed.

8. NETWORK
8(b) COUNTER AUTOMATION - BA/POCL - PC NW06 04 I

The GENERAL SECRETARY confirmed he had met with both ICL Pathway
and Dave Miller, the Project Director and an announcement was anticipated
shortly about some reorganisation which was likely together with the creation
of the new role of Communications Manager.

There continued to be concerns regarding Horizon’s ability to handle Cash
Accounts, although the CHAIRMAN pointed out that whilst the facility existed,
a manual cash account would still be required for at least 12 months.

The GENERAL SECRETARY reported that difficulties remained with the
working relationship between ICL Pathway and the Post Office who continued
to lay the blame at each other's doors for all problems and delays.

Attention was drawn by the CHAIRMAN to a number of instances where ICL

Pathway had conducted surveys following Screen 2000 installations, and ¢
condemned the electrical work undertaken by ROMEC. Dissatisfaction with

ROMEC's installations had also been expressed by a Regional Security

Manager. It was unrealistic for anyone to have to pay twice for the electrical

installation and the situation would be pursued.

In response to MRS, KENDALL’s concerns regarding the letter to be
despatched to Sub-Postmasters of Non-Cash Account offices, the GENERAL
SECRETARY confirmed it had been revised. In addition, he commented that
he was still seeking a reasonable explanation regarding the necessity of Non-
Cash Account Offices to complete a Cash Account.

It was confirmed that other than Mailwork, all other functions would have to
be undertaken once a Non-Cash Account office became a Cash Account
office, but pressure would continue to be exerted to obtain a definitive
explanation of all the associated difficulties. ,
ie

A BSC would be circulated to ensure Branch Secretaries were aware the ACTION

letter was being despatched.
With regard to those Sub-Postmasters who were participating in the trial,

enquiries would be undertaken to ascertain the official line appertaining to
the requirement to record the number of transactions per session.

The GENERAL SECRETARY confirmed that following discussion, action was
in hand regarding the above Resolutions which were either about to be
addressed in correspondence with POCL or deal with in the appropriate
Forums.

Various comments were made regarding the hardening of POCL's attitude in
respect of counter losses (98/38) in response to which, the GENERAL
SECRETARY confirmed that proposals for a revision of Sub Rem 5/88 were
awaited from POCL which it was hoped would ultimately address the current
problems and soften POCL’s approach that “you are guilty until proven
innocent’.

With regard to 98/18,19,20, the CHAIRMAN was of the view that in the case
of Resolutions 18 and 19, the recently agreed increased Product Payments

for Priority Service items did not satisfy the Federation’s long standing claim.

Resolution 20 which specifically referred to Recorded Delivery items had not

been addressed by the 1998 Pay Settlement. A letter would be written

reiterating the Federation's claim for improved payments for these products.

It was pointed out that 98/42 had been omitted from the Agenda, which
position would be rectified. Appropriate action on the subject had in any
event already been taken.

The CHAIRMAITtHRanked everyone for their assistance in moving some of the
subjects torwara-angy wished them a safe journey home.
