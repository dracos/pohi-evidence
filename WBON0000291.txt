Dear Andrew,

I’ve been through the draft skeleton and I’ve discussed it with David N.

It’s a very long document but that’s a reflection of the length of the judgment, the large number of points that
need to be addressed and the poor quality of the judgment. It’s more difficult to deal on an appeal with a bad
judgment than a good one.

David and I think the draft covers the points. We do not think that concessions should be made, eg on the
implied terms, because, as previously advised, we think the co-operation and Stirling v Maitland
implications are effective and would be readily implied in this case without the need to manufacture further
terms which is what the Judge in his wisdom has done.

We wonder if it might be possible to incorporate a high level executive summary for the benefit of the CofA
reading the document. It’s always useful to give them a guide as to where the document is going and what
the key points are.

We haven’t addressed the bits of grammar and typos which should be sorted out before the draft is finalised.

Regards,

Tony
