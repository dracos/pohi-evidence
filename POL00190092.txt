isn’t the issue at stake, we have a duty to protect public money by pursuing appropriate action (and this why some
prosecutions are still happening)? Presumably there is some kind of reasonableness test here — i.e. a spmr can’t just
get off scot free by saying it’s an Horizon issue, irrespective of the circumstances?
