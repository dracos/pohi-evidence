PS 14116              OPENING OF MEETING

                      A quorum being present, the Chair opened the meeting of the Project
                      Sparrow Sub-Committee ("the Committee") and welcomed Mark

PS 14117              INITIAL COMPLAINTS REVIEW AND MEDIATION SCHEME — THE
                      WAY FORWARD

                 (a) The Committee received a paper on the current position of the
                     mediation scheme, the progress to date and the associated risks and
                     challenges.

                 (b) The Committee discussed the three options set out in the paper with
                     reference back to the three fundamental principles agreed by the
                     Business for its approach to Sparrow:

                             to gain a fuller understanding of the facts;
                             to ensure a fair outcome; and
                             to highlight lessons learned so that improvements can be
                              made to Business processes.
                 (c) The Committee reviewed the status of the mediation scheme and the
                     urgency of any decision if it meant moving away from the current
                     position (Option 1). The Committee as reed that Option 3 would be its
                     preferred option subject to the Minister's support and there being a
                     low probability of a successful application for a Judicial Review. This
                     would be recommended to the Board.
ACTION:          (d) The Committee asked for a paper to the Board explaining the three

                                                                                       POL00006571




                  succeeding and the additional costs of defending such an action.

•             (e) The Committee agreed to recommend to the Board that:

                     •   Option I (continuing as is) was untenable given the challenges it
                         posed to the best interests of the business and value for money.

                         subject to further legal advice on risk of Judicial Review, the
                         Chairman would explored with the Minister the extent to which
                         she would be prepared to support Option 3 and explain the
                         alternative approach of Option 2 as a fall-back position.

                     •   the programme team and the Communications and Public Affairs
                         Directorate should continue to plan for the implementation of both
                         Option 2 and Option 3 on a contingency basis.

                         an approach should be developed for Option 2 which is sensitive
                         to stakeholder handling but which could be implemented quickly
                         in the event that the risks associated with Option 3 prove
                         unacceptable.
