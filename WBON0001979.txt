Freeths have confirmed:

"There is no list of those KELs that were deleted beyond retrieval, i.e. those in category 2.a) in the email below,
therefore the existence of such a KEL can only be surmised by it being referenced elsewhere (that is, on the
assumption that any such reference has been typed correctly.)"

Many thanks

Final thought: I think the answer to this is obvious but presumably FJ do not know how many irretrievable
KELs there are i.e. there is no record of the number of them?

OK but we are still left with the problem that Parker 2 has not explained this. I think this needs to be added
to the list of things which should be dealt with in Parker 3.

I think as well that your letter should make it clear that the non-retrievable KELs are in addition to those
referred to in Parker 2.

Simon

The 1,491 deleted KELs referred to in Parker 2 are the retrievable, deleted KELS which have been disclosed. This
figure does not include the non-retrievable deleted KELs. The position in our letter of 17 Jan 19 should therefore be
consistent with the disclosure of documents referred to by Parker in his statement.

Whilst the existence of these non-retrievable deleted KELS will be new to Freeths, we have not withheld any
documents from disclosure (since there is nothing to provide) and the documents which they have access to would be
the same no matter when they were informed about this.

Kind regards

Amy

The drafting of the letter is fine.

However, if I have understood this properly we are now telling Freeths for the first time that there is a further
category of KELs namely those that were deleted and are non-retrievable. This is likely to cover, as I
WBON0001979
WBON0001979

understand the evidence, the period 2000-2008. Is that right? If so, that is obviously a significant amount of
the time covered by Horizon. In WBD’s letter dated 17/1/19 reference is made to paras 61.6 and 61.9 of
Parker 2. Here he says that there are 113 deactivated Legacy Horizon KELs and 1,491 deleted KELs. In
arriving at these figures, has he included those KELs which we now know are non-retrievable? If so, then I
think it might be worth confirming this in this letter. If not, however, it will follow that we are now telling
them about the existence of entirely new KELs and we need to consider how best to present this. The
impression given by 10.2 of the 17/1 letter is that we were providing all 1,491 deleted KELs referred to in
Parker 2 61.9.

I think this should be bottomed out before this letter is sent.

Dear Simon

In Coyne 2, there are a number of references to Peaks and KELs which have not been disclosed. FJ have looked into
these for us and provided confirmation as to whether they can locate the documents and if so, provided us with a copy
of them. Please find attached a draft letter to Freeths which gives disclosure of these documents.

Peaks

FJ have managed to locate some of the Peaks referred to by Coyne in an archive of PinICL (the predecessor to
PEAK). Matthew (FJ) has confirmed:

There are two Access databases that contain some details of archived PinICLs.

Our [FJ's] understanding is that they appear to be incomplete both in terms of a) not containing all of the original
information that was stored against those PinICL details that they do contain, and b) not containing between them all
of the PinICLs that existed.

KEL

Matthew has also confirmed (see attached email) that there are different types of deleted KELs: (1) non-retrievable
and (2) deleted but saved. We have given disclosure of the Category (2) documents on 17 January 2019, and the
KELs not disclosed but referred to by Coyne are believed to fall within category (1) and therefore we cannot give
disclosure of these.

Any comments on the letter would be welcomed.
