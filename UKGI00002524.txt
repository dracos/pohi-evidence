Jo SWINSON MP
PARLIAMENTARY UNDER SECRETARY FOR THE POST OFA
House of Commons

LONDON, SW1A 0AA

Dear Madam,
J
As Parliamentary Under Secretary for the Post Office, you must be awn ofthe oa
failings in the Post Office Horizon system, and the results of the subsequent —

investigation by independent accountants Second Sight.

In May 2013 my husband was suspended as Sub Postmaster of North Cornelly Post
Office, South Wales, due to a cash shortfall caused entirely by an Horizon computer
error. The investigation into our affairs took thirteen months to complete, and in June
this year we were ‘advised that the Post Office were not pursuing any criminal
proceedings against us

We then contacted The Post Office Contracts Manager asking whether we could sell
the Post Office, in which we have invested our entire life savings, and were told
categorically no.

In order to pursue this through the Courts we now

necessary funds.

starting again is not an option.

I cannot understand how a Government funded organisation, such as the Post Office,
is able to get away with this behaviour, our lives have been ruined, and so I am asking
you to intervene on our behalf, to try and bring about a conclusion to this matter
before we lose everything we have worked our entire lives for:

Our MP Huw Iranca Davies has a complete file on our dealings with the Post Office,
which I am sure he will share with you.

Yours Sincerely

GRO
