Hi Anne
I'm in the office today and have started retrieving these days.

Question - you have three events highlighted in light blue (Tonbridge 6 Dec 07 and 12 Dec 07,
Craigpark 27 Dec 07) do you need messagestores for these also?

Kind regards
Penny

Penny, I should have said - the spreadsheet attached to previous mail shows which
branches/days are required.

Starting to think I should have gone in - my home office (the only room with ADSL
connection) is in the attic with no proper heating. So I'm sitting wrapped in a sleeping
bag with a hot water bottle. And the connection speed is dire! But still snowing hard
and I was worried about it getting worse later.

Hi Anne
Thanks for the update. I do not have any of the riposte messages saved so all will need
to be re-retrieved, but hopefully this will be just odd days. Let me know what you need

when you can.

Kind regards
Penny

Good morning,

I'm working from home today, but I did complete most of the event checks on
Friday. There are 6 or possibly 7 events which I cannot immediately rule out and
so we will need the messages for the day to seee if anyone was logged on and
what they were doing (unless you still have the Riposte event/transaction logs
available in which case I'll look at them first).

This doesn't mean that the 4/5 branches are likely to have had the problem, just
that I can't rule it out yet.

It should only take about half a day to check all the message extracts, once
available, so I think actually getting the extracts is the bit that will take time now
(especially as you aren't in the office!)

There's no point progressing with the two ringers (141832 and 005948 I. think)
although my check did trap them.

Hi Anne
Hope all is well with you.

I've received an e-mail from POL on Friday chasing for status on this exercise.
Can you give me an estimate for completion?

That said, I have been unable to get into the office today because of the weather
conditions and that may also be the case for you. Forecasts are that tomorrow
may be just as bad.

Kind regards
Penny

Mik, Steve,

Most if not all of these will be caused by Riposte checkpoints failing to be
written (a benign failure), which I should be able to confirm in most cases
from the SSC event archives. This is a quick check - a few minutes per
event/day. If I can't confirm it, then Penny will have to get the
messagestore back for the day or possibly longer, and I'll have to look in
more detail - but I hope there won't be many instances for which this is
necessary. I'll reassess the scale of the job once I've ‘done the first step.

Where the cause is the checkpoint failing to write, there are two

background processes colliding, and nothing to do with what the clerk is
(or isn't) doing:at the time.

Anne.

Anne,

I don't know how long each of these takes.

If you could give me some idea of the timescales, then, if necessary, I will
allocate some help for you.

Hi Anne, hope you are well
Just following up the audit issue from a couple of weeks past.

There are 27 instants on the list, 2 of which were the original ones,
interestingly only 10 sites.

I've had a chat with Mik, to get authorisation for you to do this and he
is ok, albeit a little concerned around the amount of time it will take.

Whilst it is urgent, I appreciate that you have a tonne of other stuff to,
so as and when you can fit these in.

Would also be interested in understanding, is there a conversation
that we need to have with the PO'S?, since there are a number that
have frequent occurrences.

Thanks

Steve

I have compared your ARQs with the event data constrained as
follows:

1. Only the specific Riposte timeout event

2. Events between 1st May 07 and 30th Nov 08 inclusive
3. Events logged between 19:00 and 19:10

4. Events logged by Counter 1

I have added a worksheet into your original spreadsheet with the
results - 27 matches. Can you confirm that your ringers are in there.
