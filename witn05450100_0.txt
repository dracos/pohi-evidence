3. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request sent to me via

email dated 22/08 2022 (the “Request’).

4. Documents provided to me by the Inquiry for the purpose of assisting in
writing this statement are listed at the end of the statement. | will make

specific reference to documents relevant in the course of this statement.

BACKGROUND

5. In terms as my role as a an FTL, | was appointed to this position in 2006,
having 26 years’ experience working for POL, visiting branches and managing
staff. The role involved manging a team of Field Support Advisors (FSAs)
who delivered training to Subpostmasters and conducted audits as scheduled
by the central scheduling team. The FSAs were previously auditors and
trainers who were then merged into one team in 2006. As with most of these
positions, they would likely previously have had years of experience of
working and managing at PO branch offices before taking on this role. When
taking on this role, they would have had classroom induction training and
ongoing training sessions as & when procedures and working practices

changed.

6. All audit process manuals and documents were held centrally, kept updated

and fully accessible to all staff to ensure that they could follow all the required

processes when undertaking their duties.

7. The planning & scheduling of audits was undertaken by a central scheduling
team. The FCAs would simply carry out the works as supplied by the

scheduling team.

8. Prior to undertaking their scheduled audit activity, the FCAs would ensure that
all the necessary paperwork was put together for recording all cash and stock
at the branch and for undertaking and compliance checks if required. They
would also note the Contract Managers (CM) details in the event any issues

arise that require escalation.
9. In the event of a problem i.e. large cash discrepancy / security issue, the FCA
would contact the CM directly and any subsequent action would be on the

instruction of the CM.

Audit of Astwood Bank Post Office:

10.On 11/09/2008 an audit led by myself and supported by colleagues Kevin
Watkins and Faith Lavender was undertaken at Astwood Bank Post Office.
This was a routine audit as scheduled by the Post Office central scheduling
team. Shortly after arriving at the branch at 8:15, the Subpostmaster Mr Julian
Wilson informed me that there would be a shortfall in monies of around £27k.
and that this was as a result of accumulated shortages over the last 5 years or
so. We undertook a full asset verification (cash & stock check) and found a

shortage of £27,811.98. Mr Wilson was then advised that he should satisfy

Page 3 of 7

WITN05450100

himself that the figures of the audit team were correct. Therefore, we then
confirmed the differences with Mr Wilson and he confirmed the audit shortage.
As per standard procedure, we contacted the Contracts Manager (CM) for the
branch, Glen Chester, and told him about the shortage. He then informed Mr
Wilson that he would be suspended pending further investigation. | also
notified Graham Brander (Fraud Team Manager) and subsequently Gary
Thomas (Fraud Advisor) to relay these findings. Mr Wilson agreed to allow us
to appoint a temporary Post Office manager to his branch in order to maintain
service at the office. All assets were transferred to the interim manager Sue

Wallace on day of audit and the audit was concluded at 16:45.

a

. On the day of audit, there was also a request from Gary Thomas (Fraud
Advisor) for us to obtain a signed statement from Mr Wilson, confirming the
facts around the shortage. We were also asked to obtain an Event Log print
out. Both of these would have been included in all the audit paperwork that

was submitted to the CM on completion of the audit.

12.1 completed an Audit report (POL00057304 & POL00119086) and Witness
Statement (POL000641 18) which are already with and have been provided to
me by the Post Office Horizon Inquiry team The request for the Witness
Statement POL00064118 came from Fraud Team and the wording and

construction of it would have been as instructed by the Fraud Team

13.1 had no further involvement with this case.

‘14. In terms of the integrity of the Horizon system, people of my grade were
simply guided by official Post Office Communications at the time which
continued to inform us that the system was robust and could not be

chahenges.

i

| 15.07 seeing the subsequent Judgements of the Gour of Appeal. it would seem
that there were issues with the Horizon system and thet Fujitsu were aware of
‘this. Had this Deen made known years before this, then I'm sure 2 lot of
innocent, law abiding subpostmasters would not have been prosecuted and
all the subsequent hardships could have been avoided.

‘Statement of Truth
| believe the content of this statement to be true.
