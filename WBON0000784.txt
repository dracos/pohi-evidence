All
Thank you for your time at last Thursday’s workshop. I felt it was very productive.

Please find attached the updated process flows from the meeting. Please let me have any comments.

Talking to Alan this morning, we would like the next meeting on the 8" August to be a final sign off of the process
flows, the mediation pack, and the comms we send to subpostmasters.

If there is anything else you would like to cover on the ath, let me know and I will add to the agenda.
Regards, Simon
