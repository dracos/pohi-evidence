AUDIT DATA EXTRACTION PROCESS .

Fe)
FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

1 Introduction

The Horizon and Horizon Online system generates transaction data that is of interest to Post Office Ltd
Internal Audit (POLIA) and other groups. Subject to certain constraints the audit data must be made
available to POLIA or other authorised groups within timescales established in the Service Description
for the Security Management Service, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

This document establishes the process for requesting audit data extractions and subsequent activities
undertaken to provide to authorised requesters.

This document is without prejudice to any of the parties and nothing contained herein shall be deemed or
construed as affecting contractual obligations or creating new contractual obligations between any of the
parties.

2 Scope

If future releases of Horizon Online introduce changes to the way that data is requested or extracted this
process will be updated to reflect those changes.

This process applies to all audit data extraction requests, namely:
e Audit Record Queries ( ARQs)
e Banking Record Queries (BQs)
e Internal Fujitsu requests

3 Audit Data
3.1 Audit Data Integrity

The integrity of audit data must be guaranteed at all times from its origination, storage and retrieval to
subsequent despatch to the requester. Controls have been established to provide assurances to POLIA
that this integrity is maintained.

During audit data extractions the following controls apply:

e Extractions can only be made via dedicated Audit Workstations (AUWs) which exist at Bracknell
and Lewes. The AUWs are subject to rigorous physical security controls, located in secure
rooms, in secure areas, subject to proximity pass access within a secured Fujitsu (UK & Ireland)
site.

e Logical access to the AUWs and their functionality is controlled by dedicated logins, 2-factor
authentication password control and is in accordance with the POA Information Security Policy,
SVM/SEC/POL/0003.

« All extractions are logged on the Audit System and supported by documented ARQs, BQs or
internal requests, all authorised by nominated persons within POL and Fujitsu. This log can be
scrutinised on the AUWs.

e Extractions will only be undertaken by individuals previously notified to POLIA. Currently this is
limited to the POA CS Security Litigation Support and the POA Audit Development personnel.
Any additions will be notified to POLIA in advance.

« Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to audit archive and re-
calculated when the files are retrieved. The result is maintained in a check seal table.

e Windows events generated by the counters within the branch/timeframe in question are checked
to ensure the counters were functioning correctly

e Agreement has been reached with POLIA regarding their rights to witness extractions without
warning or to request repeat extractions that they can witness.

3.2 Archive Requirements and Support

Historic Horizon and Horizon Online transaction data is held securely on the Audit Servers in accordance
with CR/FSP/006, Audit Trail Functional Specification. Audit data is archived in accordance with HNG-X
Audit Servicer Support Guide, DEV/APP/SPG/0020 and the audit extraction client is supported in
accordance with DEV/APP/SPG/0016, Audit Extraction Client Support Guide.

3.3 Retrieval of Audit Data

Archive audit data is retrieved in accordance with instructions contained in Audit Extraction Client User
Manual, DEV/GEN/MAN/0015.

3.4 Audit System Audit Trail

The audit trail records the date and time of each audit request process carried out on the Horizon Audit
System. The search criteria and request identifier shall be used to create the directory structure of each
audit trail. An audit trail is produced only when an audit request is marked as completed on the Extractor
Client. (The audit trail is not the Prosecution Support Database).

The Prosecution Support Databases hold information relating to when an ARQ, BQ or internal PEAK was
received, the SLA return date (if appropriate), who completed and checked the return.

3.5 Retention of Retrieved Audit Data

Retrieved data is held securely on the AUWs.

4 Authorised Requests for Audit Data
4.1 Audit Record Query

An AR@Q is a request to the Post Office Account (POA) for transaction data required to support a POL
investigation or litigation activity. The transaction data provided is held on the Audit Archive. The
request is received from the POL Casework Manager, or his nominated representative, and contains
specific search criteria. The stipulated criteria and the format of the returned data are as referenced in
the document Security Management Service - Service Description, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

The agreed annual quotas and return timeframes for ARQ requests are as referenced in the document
Security Management Service - Service Description, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

4.1.1 Specific Audit Record Query Request Detail

When creating a new request for a formal ARQ on the Audit Extraction Client the ‘requester’ selected is
‘POLIA’. This identifies the retrieval as a formal ARQ request from POL Casework Team.

4.2 Banking Record Queries (BQs)

ABQ is a request to POA for confirmation of transaction detail due to a query or dispute by POL or a
third party. Requests are only received from nominated representatives of Product & Branch
Accounting, Banking & Financial Services or Revenue Protection Departments.

Requests are received via e-mail.

The agreed annual quotas and return timeframes for BQ requests are as referenced in the document
Security Management Service - Service Description, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

Other’. This identifies the retrieval as a formal BQ request from POL Financial Departments. The
stipulated criteria and the format of the returned data are as referenced in the document Security
Management Service - Service Description, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

4.3 Internal (Fujitsu) Requests for Audit Data

Other internal agencies may require copies of historic records which are held only on the Audit Archive.
Requests are made via the internal PEAK system. The specific details required include outlet, branch
code, timeframe, output file, etc.

4.3.1 Specific Internal (Fujitsu) Request Detail
When creating a new request for an Internal (Fujitsu) request on the Audit Extraction Client the
‘requester’ selected is ‘Pathway SSC’. This identifies the retrieval as a formal Internal (Fujitsu) request.

4.4 Unauthorised Requests

In the event that direct contact is made with the Litigation Service from an external party, including, but
not limited to, the Police, Solicitors or Defence Teams, for audit data records they shall be referred to the
Post Office Limited Fraud Team at Salford.

4.5 Finalising and Returning the Audit Data
4.5.1 Encryption of Data

It is a mandatory requirement that all sensitive data communicated either by disc or e-mail is to be
encrypted. The PGP SDA Encryption tool has been selected for this use. The sender uses the
functionality of PGP encryption, producing an sda.exe file, which requires only the password for access
and decryption by the recipient. The recipient does not need PGP functionality.

See separate process, attached.

4.5.2, Returning ARQ Requests

ARQ requests are burnt to CD and the CD prevented from accepting further files or records. The CD is
labelled and the relevant detail relating to the original request is written on it. The transaction data on
the CD is checked by another member of the team to ensure completeness of the return. The CD is also
checked for viruses before being sent via Royal Mail’s Special Delivery Service to the notified contact as
detailed in SVM/SEC/PRO/0017.

4.5.3 Returning BQ Requests

BQ requests are checked by another member of the team to ensure completeness of the return. The
response is then returned via e-mail to approved contacts.
