often since it is a concurrency issue.

[Start of Response]

consider the following scenario:

h) You are attached to a shared stock unit.

2)Press Back Office, Weekly Accounting, Cash Variance.

3) This displays a screen showing the latest declaration(s) for the currently attached stock unit.
4) Press Enter.

5) The difference between the latest declaration(s) and the system derived figure is displayed.

[this also happens if you press the Variance button when making a cash declaration on the Print/Preview Declared Cash screen.

this all works fine, but the issue is that if there is a delay between steps 4) and 5) above then another user may make a new
}declaration/overwrite a declaration for that stock unit. When you press Enter at step 5) the code uses the latest declaration.
[this may be confusing because the clerk assumes it is using the declarations shown on the screen.

the counter should warn the clerk that one or declarations have changed, and the declaration list screen should be redisplayed
ith the updated declaration details.

It am awaiting confirmation of this change from POL.

started working on this Peak. Cash declaration pop up is coming at the right place now. Need to work on the comments that has
been provided by Jon

ht) By simply re-displaying the cash declaration Li
leclaration list screen.

{fo fix this you need to tag the screen using ADCController.addfag, and then just before you re-display the new sc
cid of the old one via ADCController.clearPreviousScreen (tag) -

2) Message Text

3) type to = ?cash? hard coded string -

tt screen, the clerk

can still press Prev and return to the old cash

een version get

[thanks

Hi Vipin,

User:Harishkumar Malayil

Its there is any update on this Peak? Are you able to provide business impact yet.

Date: 20-Feb-2019 06:09:47 User: Vipin John
Problem Statement ( Underlying cause of problem): Cash variance does not show correct cash position if any other user declared
leash between the time the latest cash declaration screen and discrepancy screen is displayed.

Risk of not fixing: This will be misleading to the clerk as the declaration shown on screen is different from the discrepancy.

[Benefit of fixing: The clerk will be warned that the one or more declarations have been changed and the latest declaration screen
vill be re displayed with correct values.
