Subject: Meeting with Al - draft paper [WBDUK-AC.FID26896945]

Attachments: Grounds of Appeal - Main Appeal; DRAFT Common Issues Judgment - Appeal Advice.docx

Jane, Rodric

As promised, please find attached a draft paper from WBD and DCQC on the main appeal for the meeting with Al
tomorrow. We are happy for this paper to be circulated in advance of the meeting or kept to this group and used as a
speaking note, whichever you think best.

All comments on the attached welcomed, particularly as to tone and the overall approach.

If the paper is to be circulated, please can you let Charlie (cc'd) know and he will proof read (I'm useless at spotting
typos!) and pdf before it is sent out.

I've also attached an email from DCQC earlier today with the current draft of the Grounds of Appeal. This is just for your
information; I doubt those at the meeting tomorrow will care for this much detail and these grounds are only draft anyway.

Kind regards

Andy
