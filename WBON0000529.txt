Jonny

As you know, the Judge made an order in relation to the experts having 2 days access to the PEAK/TFS
system by next Friday 15 June.

The Claimants’ expert is available on Thursday 14" and Friday 15" June for the inspection. Is this suitable
for Dr Worden and is Fujitsu able to accommodate this?

Thanks

Imogen
