I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, working on the Post Office Account, formally ICL
Pathway Ltd., since 1996 as a Customer Solutions Architect, involved in many aspects of design
and implementation of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a computerised

accounting system used by Post Office Ltd.

Audit Record Queries’s (ARQ’s) 401, 459 and 460 requested information in relation to Gaerwen
Post Office (Branch office code 160604). I was asked to produce information relating to ‘Nil’
transactions during the periods specified. I have provided three spreadsheets which I now produce
as Exhibits GIJ/01, GIJ/02 and GIJ/03.

The reports are formatted with the following headings:
For ARQ 401

Node — Counter Id

User Id — The user who did the transaction

Time — The time of transaction

Date — Date of transaction

TranType Decscription — The type of Transaction carried out together with a description of its
meaning

Amount — The amount of money that actually changed hands

Continuation of statement of Gareth Idris Jenkins

HTxnNum — Unique identifier for a banking transaction
RespCD Description — Response Code generated for a particular transaction together with a
description of its meaning

For ARQ 459 - All columns as listed in 401 plus the following below

Id — Same as Counter Id above

Application — Initiating Application (usually Banking)

RtngGwy (Routing Gateway) - which is the financial institute where the transaction is going
PAN (Primary Account Number) — Account number on the card

SaleValue - Same as Amount Above

For ARQ 460 - All columns as listed in 401 and 459 plus the following below

Counter Position - Same as Counter Id above

There are three (if these are the main reasons what are the rest ?) reasons why a zero value
transaction may be generated as part of the banking system:

The transaction has no financial effect (ie a Balance Enquiry or a PIN Change)
The transaction has been declined by the Bank

(This is a really poor choice of words which seems to accept that failures in the system are
normal and therefore may well support the postmasters claim that the system is to blame for the
losses !!!!)

Each transaction has associated with it a Response Code field, which identifies what has
happened. These values are included (together with their descriptions) in the spreadsheets
produced. In summary:

RespCd = 1, means that the transaction was Authorised by the Bank. If it is for zero value,
then this means it had no Financial effect. In all the example, such transactions were PIN
Changes or Balance Enquiries where this is indeed the case.

RespCd has a value between 2 and 10 means that the Bank declined the transaction. The
actual value indicates why (eg 3 means that the PIN was invalid and 4 means Insufficient funds)
RespCd with a value greater than 10 implies some sort of system failure. The actual value

provides further information as to the nature of the failure within the overall system

Within exhibits GIJ/1, 2 and 3, the following Response Code values explain the reasons for the
‘Nil’ transactions :

1 - Authorised OK

3 - Declined - Invalid PIN

4 - Declined - Insufficient Funds

Continuation of statement of Gareth Idris Jenkins

6 - Declined - Usage (amount)
8 - Declined - Other

23 - Failed by FI: Unexpected Response Code (Note this appears as Timeout in the spreadsheet)
26 - Failed by FI: System Unavailable - Return Card

Note that the text varies in the ARQs, but the meaning is basically the same. (what does this
mean, does it needs to be in the statement ?)
