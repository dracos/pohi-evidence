2. BACKGROUND

2.1, Following evaluation of responses to the SSR from five bidders, three suppliers were
shortlisted in July for demonstrations of their proposed offerings and negotiations
leading to agreement of draft contracts.

22, Demonstrations and contract negotiations duly took place between August 1995 and

February 1996, and on 29 February ITTs were issued to all three suppliers.

2dy Prior to issue of the ITT (via meetings held on 26 and 28 Febru:

/This paper had been approved by the
Procurement Board on 21 December 1995 and lodged with the Programme’s lawyers
on 3 January, before consideration of the issue began.

2.4. The hurdles included the minimum service requirements acceptable to the sponsors,
the minimum requirements for partnership with POCL and the development of new

business o ities, sufficient transfé f risk and a number of commercial
aspects. Having cleared
such hurdles, a supplier cannot be exclude m the competition on the grounds of

his performance in these areas unless changes have occurred or new facts come to
light which make clearance of all or any of such hurdles no longer possible.

vie In November 1995 suppliers were informed of the criteria for tender evaluation, and
that this would be based on both costs and a number of non-monetary “Value
Factors”. During the demonstrations and negotiations the Programme assessed each
supplier’s performance against these Value Factors.

2.6. Suppliers’ pre-ITT scores against the factors together with the associated rationale
were lodged prior to receipt of tenders (PWKP4-22, version 2.3, and associated
papers) following review by the Evaluation Board on 14 March, a follow-up meeting
on 18 March and subsequent approval by the sponsors’ senior Evaluation Board
members. (Paras 3.3.6 and 4.2.6 describe the action on Value Factor scores after
receipt of tenders and retenders.)

3. EVALUATION OF TENDERS RECEIVED ON 21 MARCH

3.1. Overview

3.1.1. The process to be followed from receipt of tenders to award of contract is described
in paper PWKP4-9 ‘Processing tenders: From receipt to award’ which was approved
by the Procurement Board and lodged with the Programme lawyers prior to receipt of
tenders.

3.2. Initial examination of tenders

3.2.1. Tenders were received from all three suppliers by the deadline on 21 March. Two
suppliers had provided a number of copies with ‘blank’ prices to facilitate the
application of the ‘need to know’ principle to the evaluation. The third supplier had

28 April 1996 Page 4 of 30 Issue 1.0
POL00031153
POL00031153

PWKP4-43 RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS.

not complied with this request, and the prices were therefore blanked out on a
number of copies before the tenders were released.

3.2.2. Legal advice was that, given the uncertainty as to the nature of the bids in terms of
compliance, no evaluation work should be commenced until the tenders had been
reviewed, their categorisation established and a decision taken on the approach. A
team consisting of D Miller, R Albright, K Baines and P Elliott (Bird & Bird) and
facilitated by D Selwood therefore examined each tender in sufficient detail to
establish a prima facie categorisation. Only Baines and Elliott were given access to
priced tenders in view of the potential involvement of the other team members in
reviewing value factor scores.

3.2.3. The review revealed the following (see Annex D for meaning of tender categories):

Supplier Claimed category Actual category
Cardlink Compliant Non-compliant - other
Cardlink = Non-compliant - variant Non-compliant - other

IBM Non-compliant - variant Non-compliant - other

(Pathway Compliant Compliant

Pathway Non-compliant - variant Non-compliant - other

3.2.4. Legal advice was that at this stage evaluation should cover either compliant tenders
only or all tenders and that the ITT letter allowed either course of action. If it
subsequently became clear that, for any reason, a tender could not possibly lead to an
award of contract then the evaluation of that tender could stop. Given that only one
compliant tender had been received, it was decided by the categorisation team (as in
3.2.2) that the interests of obtaining the benefits of competition were best served by
starting evaluation of all tenders.

3.3. Assurance activities
3.3.1. The assurance activities described in PWKP4-9 were carried out, and where
appropriate clarification queries were taken up with suppliers after quality assurance

of the need for the enquiry by CNT and/or the Procurement Team. The results of the
assurance activities are summarised in the following paragraphs.

Technical Assurance

33.2,

maj

POL00031153
POL00031153

PWKP4-43 RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS

Contracts Assurance

3.3.3. Apart from the compliant tender from Pathway, this activity revealed a large number
of non-compliances across suppliers. Some were inherent in the nature of claimed
variant tenders, but others were outside the scope allowed by the ITT material
relating to variants. The non-compliances were noted in readiness for any
negotiations with suppliers.

Partnership Assurance

3.3.4. The tender material was reviewed against the results of the discussions held with
suppliers during the demonstration/negotiation phase. Some differences were found
in the degree of commitment given. Some clarifications were raised and satisfactory
replies received.

Risk Transfer Assurance

3.3.5. This review was conducted by comparison of the tenders with the ITT position. As
with Contractual Assurance, a number of changes were noted across suppliers apart
from the compliant Pathway tender. Again, some were inherent in the nature of the
tenders but others were outside the scope allowed for variants by the ITT. The
changes were noted in preparation for any supplier negotiations.

Value Factor Assurance

3.3.6. In the course of carrying out the assurance activities the teams noted the need to re-
assess the pre-ITT scores. Formal reviews at Partnership, Contracts and Demo
Stream level were carried out on 25 and 26 March. At the subsequent Programme
review on 26 March, the scores and validity markings were amended for a number of
factors. The results were documented in PWKP4-33, endorsed by the Evaluation
Board on 19 April and taken forward into the evaluation of re-tenders due on 22
April.

Financial Evaluation

3.3.7. The suppliers’ prices were input to the financial model lodged prior to receipt of
tenders and initial runs of the various costing statements produced. In some
instances assumptions had to be made because of inadequacies in the information
supplied, but these were regarded as providing a sufficient degree of accuracy given
the position on the business cases (see para 3.3.8).

Business Case Appraisal

3.3.8. The figures emerging from the financial evaluation were input to the BA and POCL
business case models. The results showed that both sponsors’ business cases were
substantially non-viable, and resulted in the presentation to the Sponsor Directors
Group meeting described at 3.4.

28 April 1996 Page 6 of 30 Issue 1.0
POL00031153
POL00031153

PWKP4-43 RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS

3.4. Presentations to Sponsors

3.4.1. A presentation to sponsor commercial teams had been pre-arranged for 28 March in
order to present initial findings and to focus the teams’ attention on any new
BA/POCL commercial issues thrown up by the nature of the tenders. Very few such
issues were identified, and these were of a minor nature. However, it was concluded
that there was value in holding the presentation in any event, and in view of the
emerging position on the business cases the Sponsor Directors Group (‘SDG’) agreed
that they should also meet that day to receive an abbreviated version of the
presentation together with the Programme’s proposals on progressing the
procurement.

3.4.2. I The SDG agreed that the Core Negotiating Team (‘CNT’) should:
(a) invite all suppliers to identify major cost drivers;

(b) negotiate a revised ‘package’ with each supplier aimed at bringing costs to a
level that would make the business cases viable;

(c) _ put the packages to SDG for their agreement in principle;

(d) if SDG agreement were forthcoming, invite suppliers to submit revised prices
on the basis of their negotiated package; if it were not, then the options of
further negotiation or of discontinuing the procurement would need to be
considered.

85. Negotiations with Suppliers

3.5.1. It was agreed that Keith Baines, the head of the financial evaluation team, should be
added to the CNT at this stage, given that detailed discussion of the financial aspects
of tenders and assessment of the financial impact of prospective changes were to be
key elements of the impending negotiating process.

3.5.2. All three suppliers were telephoned on 29 March and invited to meetings on 1 April
to take forward the remit given to CNT by the SDG. They were told the purpose of
the meeting and asked to prepare for it in advance.

3.5.3. At the meetings on 1 April the CNT provided initial comments on the tenders and
allowed suppliers the opportunity to present the work they had done thus far
following the phone calls on 29 March. They were asked to submit the final results
of their work by 4 April and were handed a letter summarising the purpose of the
meeting and the way ahead. An example of the letter is at Annex E.

3.5.4. Submissions were received from all three suppliers on 4 April. After individual
consideration of the responses, the Programme Director chaired a CNT meeting on 9
April to determine the negotiating strategy for the impending meetings with
suppliers.

3.5.5. I Meetings were held with suppliers on 10 - 12 April to explore further the responses
received on 4 April and to negotiate in principle a package designed to substantially

POL00031153

PWKP4-43 RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS

reduce the service costs to sponsors from those flowing from the tenders lodged on
21 March. Suppliers’ considered responses to the points raised in the discussions
were received on 15 April.

3.5.6. The results of the negotiations, including the responses received on 15 April, were
put to SDG on 16 April and their views sought on the acceptability in business terms
of the prospective changes. Invitations to retender on the basis of the negotiations,
the supplier responses and the SDG decisions were issued to suppliers on 16 April;
tenders were required to be submitted by 22 April.

4, EVALUATION OF RE-TENDERS RECEIVED ON 22 APRIL

4.1. Approach taken
4.1.1. y

— the purpose of the retender a variant bid was any bid

which was not compliant, and could include any variant elements the supplier might
wish. A commitment was given to evaluate all bids, whether compliant or variant.

4.1.2. It had been agreed by the Programme’s legal advisors prior to receipt of retenders
that, given the terms of the ITR, evaluation should start immediately on all retenders,
i.e. there was no need for an initial examination of the kind carried out on the tenders
received on 21 March.

4.1.3.

displaying varying degrees of non-compliance with the ITR. They were subjected to
the process described in PWKP4-9, tailored to the amount and type of information
received. Clarifications, where necessary, were sought from suppliers.

4.1.4. Asa result of one supplier submitting additional, unsolicited information in response
to the ITR after the permitted deadline, all suppliers were informed in writing that

such information might not be taken into account. ‘Any such “late” information
-Teceived has not formed part of the evaluation process.

4.1.5. Although all retenders contained pricing information, the members of the teams
undertaking the Technical, Contracts, Partnership and Value Factor reviews were not
exposed to the results of the financial evaluation until they had completed their
activities.

4.2. Assurance activities

Technical Assurance

4.2.1. This was found to be necessary, given es in supplier positions in some areas
from their pre-ITR position.

However, a number of issues were identified for feeding into the Contract Assurance
review and the team re-assessed the Demo Stream Value Factor scores (see paras
4.2.6 and 4.2.7).

POL00031153
POL00031153

PWKP4-43 RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS

Contracts Assurance

4.2.2. Extensive activity was needed in this area given the number and type of non-
compliances across the tenders. A separate report (PWKP4-40) details the results of
this review, and a summary is given at section 5. In addition, the team re-visited the
Contracts Stream Value Factor scores (see paras 4.2.6 and 4.2.7).

Partnership Assurance

4.2.3. This was carried out in parallel with the Contracts Assurance described in para 4.2.2.
No changes were identified compared with the position identified previously
(described in para 3.3.4).

Financial Evaluation
4.2.4. Extensive work was carried out in this area, using the financial models approved

prior to tender receipt. A separate report (PWKP4-43) was produced and is
summarised in Section 6.

Business case Evaluation —

4.2.5. The results of the financial evaluation were used to update the BA and POCL
business cases. }

Value Factor Assurance

4.2.6. As a result of the findings of the Technical and Contracts assurance activities, both
the Contracts and Demo streams wished to re-assess suppliers’ scores under the ten
non-monetary value factors. The Evaluation Team acknowledged that caveats might
be placed on the results, given the exposure of the assessors to pricing information.
However, having taken legal advice, it

A
Programme assessment review was held on pril and the results are detailed in

PWKP4-41. The scores were input to the evaluation of non-monetary factors
described in Section 7.

5: RESULTS OF THE CONTRACT ASSURANCE REVIEW
S.1. The full results of this review are set out in PWKP4-40:

(a) Each retender was compared with the corresponding ITR to establish the
degree of compliance. The results were structured around the decisions given
by the SDG on 16 April, supplemented by details of non-compliances in areas
additional to those considered by SDG.

1. THE VALUE ASSESSMENT AND FINANCIAL RESULTS

TA. Process

7.1.1. The treatment of Value Factors, including the weightings and sensitivity analyses to
be applied to the scores in the evaluation, is described in paper PWKP4-S5, issue 3.0
dated 30 November 1995 ‘Use of Value Factors in final evaluation & selection’.
This paper was agreed by the Procurement Board late last year and lodged the
Programme lawyers prior to receipt of tenders.

The process of arriving at the Programme scores prior to receipt of tenders is
described in paper PWKP4-25 Issue 1.0 dated 11 March 1995 ‘Supplier scores in
respect of Value Factors’ approved by the Evaluation Board on 14 March. The pre-
tender scores themselves are contained in paper PWKP4-22 Issue 2.3 dated 20 March
“Programme Value Factor Assessment - 7 March 1996’ and associated papers.

The process for re-assessing the scores after receipt of tenders, together with the
resultant scores, was as described in paper PWKP4-33 Issue 1.0 dated 11 April
“Programme Value Factor Assessment - 26 March 1966’ approved by the Evaluation
Board on 19 April.

supplier is to achieve a large well-rounded shape, i.e. one in the upper reaches of the
scores with a degree of consistency throughout:

8. OTHER AREAS RELEVANT TO THE EVALUATION
8.1. The purpose of this section is to consider two aspects that allow the results of the

contract assurance activity, the financial evaluation and the value factor assessment
to be considered in their full perspective.

8.1. Risk Transfer

8.1.1. Risk transfer was been considered throughout the evaluation and the results are
reflected in the contract assurance, financial and value factor reports. It was also
necessary to consider the degree of risk transfer achieved in relation to the
acceptability of the prospective contracts in PFI terms. Particular emphasis was
placed on the need for confirmation that ‘tisk had been transferred in the areas of

The assessments below have

taken account of discussions with Treasury and the PFI unit in a non-supplier

specific environment.

8.1.2. The suppliers’ position on five major elements of PFI compliance is summarised in
the following table:

Taking the three suppliers in anticipated order of acceptability:

It is expected that the prospective deal with Pathway would be regarded as PFI-

compliant;

(b) The position on Cardlink is less clear than that for Pathway, but it is thought
probable that PFI compliance would be accepted;

given the company’s position on fraud risk, the inbuilt RPI protection
mechanism and the high (90%) revenue guarantee.

Partnership Capability

As mentioned in section 3, the tender material was compared with the commitments
obtained at meetings with suppliers last year. In summary, Cardlink’s position was
unchanged, IBM showed some reduction in commitment an

However, all three suppliers continued to make a

i

satisfactory showing.

The review of the retenders showed no change from this position.

9. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION
O14. The following group, which the evaluation team considered a suitable representation

in terms of function and organisation, met on 26 April to consider the results of the
evaluation and reach a conclusion:

. Dave Miller CNT POCL
. Pat Kelsey CNT BA/DSS
. Robert Albright CNT POCL
. Tony Johnson Demo/

Technical BA/DSS
. Stuart Riley Financial BA
. Keith Baines Financial POCL

912. It was assisted by:

. Hamish Sandison Lawyer Bird & Bird
. Derek Selwood Facilitator Kermon
. Nick Richardson Facilitator Kermon
9.3. The group considered the results from the various streams of activity feeding into the
evaluation:

(a) the Contracts Assurance review ranked the suppliers in the order Pathway,
onsidered that Cardlink should not be awarded the contract
at any price, because of its unacceptable degree of non-compliance with
contract requirements. Pathway should be preferred to IBM unless IBM’s bid
offered a considerable price advantage.

(b) i i iT ving considered both direct and indirect cost
implications,

fromthe standpoint of BA” and POCL:  Cardlink were significantly more

expensive than these two.

(©) the Value Factor re-assessment had shown a close match between the three

. On ‘internal’ factors covering the soundness in terms of servic
delivery (e.g. stability and coherence, fraud-free method of payment) the orde:
was again Cardlink, IBM and Pathway, with the first two being significantl
ahead of the third.

(d) the Partnership Assurance review had concluded that all three suppliers were
judged to be satisfactory future partners with POCL in generating new
business.

(e) the Risk Transfer Assurance review had concluded that the deal with
Pathway would be regarded as PFI-compliant, that the position of Cardlink was
less clear cut but would probably be regarded as acceptable but that the IBM
position was thought to be unacceptable in PFI terms.

9.4. The group considered that Cardlink should be eliminated from further consideration
at this stage. It ranked first on the Value Factors and was thought to be PFI-
compliant, but was significantly behind the other two on costs and its bid was
regarded by the Contracts Assurance review as one that was unacceptable.

9:5. As to IBM and Pathway, IBM’s tender showed the lowest cost of service but the two
were sufficiently close to be regarded as equal on price. They were virtually equal on
the ‘external’ value factors, but IBM were clearly be

9.6. However, there w

ies. The Contracts review had
recommended that IBM needed a significant cost advantage to be preferred to
Pathway, and in doing so had drawn special attention to the IBM stance on fraud risk
transfer as being one which had previously been rejected by Sponsor Directors. The
Risk Transfer review had concluded that the IBM bid would not be regarded as
acceptable in PFI terms.

O77,

018, Whilst acknowledging the implications of selecting Pathway, the group considered
this a far preferable prospect to the consequences of awarding to IBM (in the unlikely
event of their being regarded as PFI-compliant), given IBM’s stance on fraud risk
transfer and other factors, most notably limited liability.

9.9. The group thereforé unanimously Concluded that it should recommend to the

Evaluation Board that any contract award should be made to Pathway.

ANNEX C - DEFINITION OF PRE-ITT HURDLES

The definition is reproduced from paper PWKP4-8, ‘Pre-ITT Hurdles’

Any service provider invited to submit a best tender must have cleared a number of
“hurdles”. The Stage 3 work and the commercial assessments will assess whether the
following conditions are met:

(a) Service Requirements

The minimum service requirements acceptable to the sponsors as identified in
the requirements catalogue; this includes:

i. customer acceptability: make sure customers perceive no material
worsening in services from POCL; and the new benefit payment service
is likely to be acceptable to all customer groups who choose to be paid
their benefits at post offices;

ii. staff / agent acceptability: the services are likely to be acceptable to the
system users comprising BA and POCL staff and agents;

iii. fraud-free method of payment:

signi

iv. the proposed services meet the minimum requirements specified in the
requirements catalogue with respect a transaction
process & system response times, reliability and flexibility;

v. the provision of full accounting reconciliation and audit facilities,
consistent with recognised accounting practices;

vi. the provision of arrangements for making emergency payments in the
event of system failure; and ensure the financial impact and speed with
which full services are reinstated are acceptable;

vii. the ability to make one-off payments at short notice (within the service
levels specified in the requirements catalogue);

viii. the capability of the proposed systems (and services) to enable POCL to
automate all its clients products and to use automation to develop new
services in line with its greater commercial freedom;

28 April 1996 Page 26 of 30 Issue 1.0

ix. provide for the automation of all post offices in some format, achieving
minimum levels of automated business within a reasonable timeframe,
ensuring the overall coherence and accountability of post office services;

x. _ the service provider has adequate management and technical capability to

develop and deliver the proposed services (ié) there) are noymajor »
}
(b) Partnership

The minimum requirements for partnership with POCL and the development of
new business opportunities (as described in the Prospectus and the SSR). This
includes ensuring that there are no major concerns relating to:

i. the ability of the service provider to support POCL in identifying and
prioritising automation options following the initial automated
transactions;

ii. the likelihood of the service provider developing a successful commercial
relationship with POCL, initially in the role of supplier to POCL with
potential to develop closer commercial ties leading to joint ventures if
appropriate;

iii. POCL retaining control of its commercial planning and the products
offered at post offices.

(c) Risk Transfer

Sufficient transfer of risk for an acceptable risk profile, in particular for the
fraud risks and system errors but also for the general service development,
operation and business volume risks;

(d) Commercial Aspects
i, an acceptable funding method and financial structure;

ii. acceptable financial guarantees in the event of catastrophic system
failure;

iii. satisfactory termination arrangements that avoid lock-in;
iv. agreement to a common charging structure;

v.  POCL to retain control of its critical operational processes, and of its key
commercial relationships (e.g. clients and agents);

vi. no material damage to the Post Office brand.

ANNEX D - CATEGORISATION OF TENDERS RECEIVED ON 21 MARCH

A tender was either compliant or non-compliant. There were four categories of tender
covered by these two states:

Compliant

A tender which was fully compliant with the ITT and clarifications; the ‘baseline bid’ referred
to in para 3.1 of the ITT letter of 29 February.

Non-compliant - Variant

A tender offering ‘risk’ variants on the baseline bid. Should conform with the principles of
the Common Charging Mechanism but may show the effect on price per servicepoint of
variations on the allocation of risk. No limit on the number allowed. Referred to in para 3.2
of the ITT letter.

Non-compliant - Alternative

A tender offering an alternative tariff structure. Maximum of two allowed. Referred to in
para 3.3 of the ITT letter.

Non-compliant - Other

A tender which was non-compliant for a reason or reasons other than those specified for the
other two non-compliant categories.

Note:

For the purposes of the ITR and retenders, different terminology was used. A retender was
either compliant with the ITR or variant (i.e. not compliant with the ITR).
