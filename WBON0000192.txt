Pete,

Thanks again to you and the team for your time on the phone on Friday. It was helpful to flesh out the comments
provided in relation to Mr Roll's statement.

I attach a draft response to Mr Roll's statement that is based on Friday's discussion. You'll see that there are several
comments and questions where further detail is required. Please would you provide the information requested by
close of play tomorrow?

Let me know if there's anything you want to discuss.

Kind regards

Jonny
