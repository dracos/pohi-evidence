Steve,

That is what we have attempted to make clear with the second version of the CP (with updates in blue) to identify what
impact the change was seeking as opposed to the contractually agreed charges which would be put back to POL for
them to determine which option they would like to progress.

John

The charges are what is already stated in the contract, i.e. for every query over 100 the cost is £187 and some pence.
We have just extrapolated that and said what the cost will be. This CR and associated CP is to provide options to
increase the number from 100 to a greater number, and the associated cost to do so to POL.

Thanks

Ken,

My observation is that we can’t put priced options ina CT. This CP does contain options, however. If you think this is
handleable, fine. Otherwise, I'd recommend a dialogue with POL before CPs/CTs were raised in order to reach a
decision on which option to go for.

Cheers, John

threshold of 100 Audit Request Queries (ARQ's) for Horizon Banking and Card Account Products, to either 200, 250 or
