Hi Catherine,

I just discussed this with Kevin and he was quite strong on this. I outline his reasons below — if SoS is
still unsure, Kevin would happy to meet with him to discuss.

* Lord Arbuthnot and Kevan Jones MP are strongly in favour of including Prof Moorhead
because of his credentials. Kevin spoke with Lord A candidly to discuss this submission and Lord
Astill thinks Prof Moorhead should be included.

* Better to have Moorhead included so his criticism can be more focused/ constructive and he
can feel part of the process, than have him not part of the group and criticising from the
outside.

* We should be welcoming challenge as Government, particularly on this issue — we need
people to hold our feet to the fire on this, so we can make sure we get it right.

* Inviting someone who has been critical of how Govt has run the schemes in the past might
make affected postmasters more confident in the scheme

Best wishes,
Cora

Hi Cora,

SoS has reviewed this with the following comments. Could you please pass these onto Minister
Hollinrake and then I'll pass answers/thoughts back to SoS afterwards?

‘1 don’t think we can appoint him based on his very recent criticism of BEIS. Having said that, keen to
hear Kevin’s thoughts on why we should? Does Kevin know of him and have they spoken? Does Kevin
feel it would help moderate his outbursts to have him onside/onboard perhaps?

Thanks,
Catherine

Hi Rob,

Thanks for sending up. This has been reviewed by the Secretary of State, Minister Hollinrake and
SpAds. The SoS would like to know when Moorhead’s blog was written? (the one highlighted on the

last page)
If you’re able to let me know by 3pm then I should be able to get you a full readout tomorrow.

Thanks,

Catherine
