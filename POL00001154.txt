is the manin hard disc and the other is called a mirror disc.
This is

land can be
ushed into another base unit.
In the event of a breakdown, e.g.in the comms card, then the
engineer is
supposed to take a new base unit to the office, extract the
irror disc from
ithe old unit and put it into the new base unit.
fIn that way ALL messages are safe.

on this occasion (see E-0307020207) the engineer found that the

comms was not
working so he replaced the complete base unit including the
mirror disc. This

This is a single-counter office. That means that the counter has

lises in it which hold two separate copies of the message store.
