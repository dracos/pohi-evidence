rewrite so significantly at this time of night!

I know. I'm wondering if we give it to Portland to prepare properly as part of the Q&A pack.
It will probably help them.

Many thanks, will integrate your language below, which is spot on.
Exchanging phone calls/emails with Susan and Hugh to try to pin them down
on the prosecutions point... I agree we need something fairly clear if pressed

on miscarriages of justice...

The whole brief needs re-writing, infuriating!

Looks good in your rewrite.

I think in the main body we really need to emphaise more that there is no
connection between the 14 and the 64 and the spot reviews o prosecutions.

Do they need an if pressed line on miscarriages of justice? "Nothing has
emerged in this report to suggest wrongful conviction. Cases have been
through the judicial process and we have never relied entirely on Horizon in
any court case"

I'd use the bit at the bottom of my email below, reproduced here for ease of
reading

we must be satisfied that when the report is
released it truly reflects the position - the Post
office business is too important to too many
people for faith to be questioned unfairly

Another point which needs bringing out is the
public money point - we do have a duty to protect
public money, and where there is wrongdoing we
must act: it would be entirely wrong if we did not.
We want to support our people and will make sure
that we do everything we can to improve training
and support in order to ensure that their
stewardship of public funds cannot be questioned.

On BBC - Concerned to learn that you have lined up an interview
with the BBC. Keen to understand your thinking here.

On media statement - we can offer to share statements but not
to agree them: he will try to water ours down. Suggest we say in
the brief "We will let you know our handling plan in relation to
the media, and share statements. We would be grateful if you
were able to do the same. You will appreciate the danger of the
media exaggerating the report and our need firmly to defend
our reputation."

on Fujitsu: "clearly this issue has significant bearing on one of
our suppliers, Fujitsu. They will be asked for their views on the
report before publication."
On the User group naming, I know Lesley and Alwen were keen
to avoid referencing Horizon so it needs a call from them. I am
uneasy too because it places all the emphasis on the
"computer"

Current version is pretty weak.

The speaking note needs to be firmer - we want to
make clear our position and underline our view
that no evidence to support the systemic failures.

It should specifically address the BBC point. WHAT
POINT SHOULD WE MAKE. GRATEFUL FOR SOME
WORDS

A really key point is that we should not guarantee
to agree our media lines with JA. If he comes out
strongly as it sounds as though he will, we will
have no choice but to come back strongly. Soam
concerned about the line where it talks about
agreeing media statements. SO SHOULD WE
REMOVE THIS ALTOGETHER? DIFFICULT TO ASK
FOR HIS MEDIA STATEMENT WITHOUT OFFERING
TO SHARE OURS...

There needs to be a line in there about Fujitsu if
there isn't currently. WHAT LINE?

I think it needs to be up front in addressing the
issue where JA is said to be angry - the
prosecutions and the new evidence.

On training we need to be very careful about
language - the current version is too loose - this is
your point about not leaving any glimmer which
suggests that cases might need to be reopened. So
we need to acknowledge that training can always
be improved (rather than our training must be

POL00297040
POL00297040
improved - important difference) and need to
follow that with further statement that there is no
evidence of systemic failures.

The brief needs to make clear that none of the 14
or the 62 impact on the spot reviews in the interim
report and are therefore not relevant to the
interim report.

We shouldn't call the user group a "Horizon" user
group - makes it appear we are acknowledging
issue with Horizon - branch management user
group? CAN WE CALL IT AN HORIZON SUPPORT
USER GROUP?

Can you send final version to me before it goes
wider so I can go through one more time? Will
look back on notes to see what missed.

Overall it didn't feel to me that it captured Alice's
views and I think she was right to be so clear.

It may be worth setting out three overall "rocks"
for the two of them to return to:

- there is no evidence in the interim report to
support any suggestion of systemic failures

- this is a system which deals with six million
transactions a day or more than 40 million a week,
and is used by more than 50,000 people every day

- we must be satisfied that when the report is
released it truly reflects the position - the Post
office business is too important to too many
people for faith to be questioned unfairly

Another point which needs bringing out is the
public money point - we do have a duty to protect
public money, and where there is wrongdoing we
must act: it would be entirely wrong if we did not.
We want to support our people and will make sure
that we do everything we can to improve training
and support in order to ensure that their
stewardship of public funds cannot be questioned.

We also need to bring out the scale more - how
many convictions over what period compared with
xx transactions in 11800 branches etc...

On the prosecutions
section of the brief
there is a half-finished
sentence (see below) —
what were you planning
to say?! Was this going
to cover the issue
around previous
convictions? If not,
what is our best
possible defence
against the suggestion
that this process had
called into question the
validity of previous
prosecutions? Think we
definitely need a line on
this.

On the first bullet

below, presumably we
should add a sentence
to state that where it is
clear that the Horizon
system isn’t the issue at
stake, we have a duty
to protect public money
by pursuing appropriate
action (and this why
some prosecutions are
still happening)?
Presumably there is
some kind of
reasonableness test
here —i.e. a spmr can’t
just get off scot free by
saying it’s an Horizon
issue, irrespective of
the circumstances?
