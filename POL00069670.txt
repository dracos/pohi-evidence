ie service of the Skeleton, the reply that had been amended, the Pre-Trial Checklist and the
bundles. Also explaining to him my conversation with Mr Castleton and alternative strategy,
what I thought Mr Castleton was trying to do. Tom doubted that he was as ill as he made
out. Explaining to Tom that Mandy was backing our strategy and that we were getting on
with the bundling and I said I didn’t really think there was much he could do at the moment
apart from agree a fee for Thomas Bourne to attend the trial, for one, preferably two weeks,
but lets see how we go on the first week and Tom will do that directly with Mandy.
