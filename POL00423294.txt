Hi Gizelle,

lam very pleased to confirm that I have the go ahead to raise a purchase order for the fees we currently owe you
(£7,433 for 1* April to 31* July). In addition we would like to accept your revised quote with effect from 1*t August 2015,
and I am also in the process of raising a purchase order for £9,270.

Please can you confirm that we can switch to the revised pricing from 1** August 2015, and let me know if there is
anything I need to get signed.

It would be great to have a meeting to discuss how we can promote the line better — possibly in the latter half of August,
if you are around?

Thanks,

Georgina

Hi Georgina

The outstanding fees from 1° April to end July equate to £7,433. If you decided to go with the revised pricing we could
switch this wef 1% August.

If on the other hand the Post Office decided to terminate, then there would be the fees in accordance with the
termination period of three months (£5,574).

The key issue is that the line has not been promoted which is something that InTouch can help you with, would it be
worth having a meeting with yourself and the new person who is now overall responsible?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi,

’'m so sorry —I don’t think I got it when you sent it the first time. However, I have now looked at it and I’m fairly
confident we will be able to achieve what we are aiming for. The key decision maker is on leave until the end of next
week, but I will see if I can get anybody else to release some money.

If we did decide to go with your new quote for the revised scope of service, how would that work with the existing
contract (ie. at what point can we swap, and how much do we still owe you on the old one? — it would be helpful if I can

pull some sort of ball park figure together.

Am just dashing out of the office to evade the Tube strike this evening, but if it would be easier to chat on the phone let
me know and I'll call you tomorrow.

Thanks,

Georgina

Hi Georgina

Have you had any feedback on the quotation I sent through and the outstanding PO as the auditors are now jumping up
and down as you can imagine?

I have attached the quotation again for your reference.

Kind regards,
Gizelle

Subject: Speak Up Line - scope of service

Hi Gizelle,

Our existing contract with you is based on our ‘Speak Up Line’ being made available to all Post Office employees, agents
(ie. subpostmasters) and agents’ assistants, which covers all 11,500 or so branches, as well as the support functions and
directly managed supply chain functions, which could be as many as 50,000 to 60,000 individuals.

We have decided we want to restrict the line to Post Office employees, and direct consultants, contractors and agency
workers (but not subpostmasters and their assistants) and are amending our policy accordingly. This will mean that the

number of individuals who could potentially use the line will drop to less than 9000.

Would you be able to let me know whether this reduction in expected users of the service could be reflected in any
reduction in the fee charged for the Speak Up services which we receive from you?

Many thanks,

Georgina
