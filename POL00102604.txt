Dear Jonathan,

In my email of 10 October 2015, I sent you a draft chronology of events over the last four years, and said that I would
provide you with the documents it is drawn from early this week. Having now collected c75% of these documents it is
apparent that their volume is significant : some 136MB_ of documentation has been collated to date — not all of which
would necessarily be helpful to you at this stage of the work.

Can I suggest instead that, looking at the attached updated Chronology, you identify any documents you feel you would
particularly like to see at this juncture and I will ask the team to get them over to you as soon as possible? For
information purposes, those ‘events’ that are highlighted in yellow have been previously supplied and those with a ‘tick’
in the ‘schedule’ column have had their supporting documentation identified.

We continue to collate the remaining documents, and will discuss with you the best way of getting these documents to
you.

In respect of the outstanding questions (6 & 7) you posed in the draft Terms of Reference - I hope to be in a position to
provide answers to these shortly.

Kind Regards

Jane MacLeod
