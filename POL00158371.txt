I have updated Doug based upon the information you have provided, sounds
like good news. My concern is that there remain a number of anomalies
which clearly require investigation.

In readiness for period 9 reporting, and Carol's return, could we pull
together some kind of summary of the offices where we still have
differences, the 49 in question. I think we need to understand,

- month on month is the value of the difference consistent, or does the
difference vary over time? Could your summary include trend analysis from
period 3 onwards.

- can we isolate this to a particular day or transaction/rem?

- what is the overall value of the difference, is Flexible Planning

greater than POL FS or the other way around?

- what is the impact of this difference? Do we need to make any kind of
provision for this difference? Without knowing the value of the difference
I'm not sure if its material.

If you could pull this together over the next few days then could you go
through this with Carol or Marie, in the first instance or myself if they

are not around. My understanding is that Carol is aiming to come into

work on Monday although this is not 100% certain at this stage. We needa
decision about provisions by around next Wednesday so if Carol does not
come in you may wish to speak to Marie and walk her through your findings.

Does this sound ok?

Thanks
Dawn

November (period 8) which has reduced the number of FP V POLFS
differences

to49 . Three were new at period 7 and seven newat period 8 most of
the other differences have been their since periods 3 and 4.

Ann/Dawn,

This is one of the issues you were pushing me and Scott to push forward.
As you can see Fujitsu implemented a fix back in June and we have been
awaiting evidence of what if any problems remain since. I will shortly be
relinquishing responsibility for POL FS so I would be grateful if you

could update us with what the ongoing problems are as soon as possible so
I can ensure this is handed over to whoever picks up my old role.

Thanks

I'll have a word with Doug to see where we are with this one, because as
you mentioned it's now appearing in both the LFS and POL FS ORF's. With
that in mind I would presume that the problem is still ongoing but I will
confirm as soon as Doug is back from leave.

Hi again Mark,
Please can you confirm if we can close this problem down?
A fix was implemented in June this year - if this has not achieved the

desired result we need to know what issues are still remaining.

Doug and Sid copied because this action point is now appearing in both
LFS and POL FS ORF's.

I have just had some feedback forwarded to me after a brief conversation
with one of the uses which I think relates to the problem ref. above.

More
detail should come out of the meeting arranged for Wednesday next week
(16.08.06) and I will contact Mark Wood and Dave Lancashire if required.

The perception is though that the users are not happy with the fix and
Pele will have to remain open.

WP23933 (BE/0137387)(Document link: Julie Dart)

I'm not entirely happy with this response from Fujitsu, we do not
understand what the fix has actually achieved, what the effect should
have

been for example and neither do we understand the time when it was
applied.

There would appear to have been quite an impact on cash in pouches but
we

are not clear if this was intended or not. Normally we have around 88
differences between flexible planning and POL FS, with 33 of these
differences existing since period 6 last year. At period 3 there were
around 2000 differences.
Our comparison was done at the period end, based upon period 3 data, at
25

June 2006. If the fix was applied after this data then we might not

have

seen the impact.

Limited resource means that we will not be repeating the comparison

until

period 4, 30 July 2006.

Could you please liaise with Mark Wood and Dave Lancashire with regards
the

period 4 results to assess the impact of the fix and help us to push

back

to Fujitsu if appropriate?

Thanks

WP23933 (BE/0137387)

Hi Julie,

Good Morning.

Here is the update regarding the WP23933 mentioned in BIM
BE/0137387.(APS

BIM mail sent on 13/07/06)

This was a problem that was under investigation since mid March this
year.

There was a bug in S60 where EOD failed to summarise correctly and left
the

balances set to incorrect values.

When summarisation changed at S80, this mechanism was still used for
calculating the generated cash position for SAP ADS and the figure is
calculated cumulatively from an S60 migration baseline.

The underlying problem was related to CABSPROCESS at the counter
sometimes

not updating the CofABalance persistent object with the generated cash
value that is sent to POLFS daily in the BLE files.

Now the first time that CABSProcess runs after a TP rollover a double

check

on the Balance attribute of <Collection: CofABalance><ObjectName:551000>
will be made. If it checks out OK an information event "Message: Balance
object checked and no discrepancy found!" will be written to the event

log

POL00158371
POL00158371
and if it does not check out an error event will be written to the event

log an example of which is ""Error Message: The CofABalance 551000
object

has been corrected.The original balance was -52.38 and the corrected
balance was -52.39.". In the latter case
<Collection:CofABalance><ObjectName:551000> will be corrected and it
will

have an extra attribute ErroneousBalance with the incorrect balance.

A fix to correct this was applied in WP23933, which was meant to:
1. Re-basline the balances from the Office Rollover values.
2. Notify and correct if the balances ever get out of step again.

WP23933 commenced live delivery 13/6/06 (LFS_COUNTER 31_2)
