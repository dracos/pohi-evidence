16/06/2008 09:59 Subject: Fujitsu ARQ contract

John,

Following a voicemail that I left for Liz Tuddenham re the above, she has pointed me in your direction
as I am trying to locate a copy of the FS/POL contract which covers the adhoc banking queries. These
are submitted by both the POL Fraud team and the Network Banking teams to Fujitsu Services asking
for FS to check the banking data for specific transactions.

I am afraid that I do not know the reference for the contract but it has been in place for at least4 years,
possibly longer. I have drawn a blank with FS and am hoping that you will be able to help.

We will shortly be holding workshops with the relevant teams to review the current situation as the
volumes of requests are now far higher than the original agreement. So a copy of the original set up
would be very useful to give us an idea of costs etc.to enable us to progress this.

Happy to discuss if necessary.

Many thanks.

On the extra DWP queries - I had expected that these would be priced separately as an optional extra,
so that we could bill DWP for them if used; it seems to be bundled in as one price which we pay
whether the DWP extras are used or not, and with no identifiable price that we can recharge.

Can you check and investigate please.

“an essential part of everyday life”

Dear Colin

Re: Audit Record Queries

Further to your letter of 9"° June 2004, in which you outlined the principles

relating to an increase in the annual limits and the increased costs in the

number of Audit Record Queries.

I can now confirm that Post Office wish to exercise the option to increase

the number of Audit Record Queries as per your letter, and by this letter is

giving you notice that we want the new arrangements to apply from 1*

September 2004..

From that date we also expect that the volume of additional queries and é
charges will be pro rata ( e.g. 7/12 of those quoted in your letter) for the

remainder of this financial year.

I can also confirm that the ‘counting period’ for queries and charges will
run from April — March each year.

Yours Sincerely

Firstly, the total number of Audit Record Queries, under the proposed increase available for a"
complete" year is 720 (or 15,000 query days) , which ever is reached first.

This equates on a monthly basis to 60 per month (or 8750 query days)

Secondly, as we have to give 1 months' notice to bring the revised limits into operation, we would be
able to have 7 months at the new levels until the end of the financial year ( March 2005). This means
that the quoted amount of £170k, per annum, equates to approx £100k for the 7 months until the end
of the financial year.

I should also mention that for DWP queries an additional 84 queries can be accommodated,
equivalent to 7 per month, although 10 per month could be accommodated provided the annual total
does not exceed 84.

Finally, FS are asking that if the proposed new limits are agreed, could we regularise the "query year"
(currently based on calendar years), with the financial year and run in future with the fiscal year.

Regards. John Cole.

As discussed, we are looking at achieving 50 requests per month for the remainder of the year, at
present End of December, but from what you were saying potentially end of March.

Can you just confirm that the incremental step process is the only avenue open to us and that we will
have the required request numbers using this process. If you could give us the exact figures, it would
be most helpful, as we will use whatever requests are available.

As you can imagine, with the changes taking place in the business at present, we are in increasing
need of Horizon data and are still avoiding asking for it wherever possible in order to preserve our
requests. This means that we will inevitably be looking for further increased access in due course and
I will be preparing a blueprint to gain direct access in the next few weeks.

Subject: Fujitsu contract changes = 6iiail' T

Please see the email below from Tony Marsh, Can you please give an update to what activity has
been undertaken with regard to gaining direct access to Horizon data for use within the business.

I believe Tony raised the idea of us having our own access to the audit data from within the business
via a terminal (probably at Chesterfield) via which, we would be able to obtain data for all parts of the
business and remove the need for us to make data requests of Fujitsu. I understand that Alan Barrie
was aware of this suggestion and had been supportive of our approach. We had considered the
download tat Tony mentions, but had felt that this would simply be a recreation of the data warehouse
and probably cost more than simply gaining access to our own data via the existing one.

This issue has become considerably more important recently, as investigators are finding it
increasingly difficult to pursue criminal cases without having access to audit data. Defence team have
also identified this as a means of delaying and in some cases potentially ceasing prosecution activities
and as you can see from Tony's email this has meant that we have had to increase our use of audit
requests to a point whereby we will run out at the end of August, with potentially serious consequences
thereafter.

A further complication will come next year when much of the paper based evidence that the business
uses to prove events that have taken place at branches will disappear. This will require even more
data requests, possibly including requests from elsewhere in the business, almost certainly in excess
of the agreed increase we have been allocated, albeit nobody seems to have the money to pay. -

I would be happy to meet up and discuss our options and opportunities in respect of this issue and
would be happy to assist in developing a business case to support our gaining greater access to the
data warehouse.

Dave

The circumstances detailed in the email chain below, which I understand made a significant
contribution to the overall cost reductions in the renegotiated Fujitsu contract, and the reply in the
email immediately following this one, now appear likely to curtail effective investigation activity from
next month for the remainder of the calendar year.

I felt with my highlighting the issue in January 2003 (4th entry down) I had done enough to gain IT and
Operations buy-in to the Security position whilst behaving in a business-focussed manner in not
demanding a high-cost comfort zone or safety net.

John Cole's reply in the accompanying email suggests otherwise. I'd be grateful if you'd take a look
and decide whether you concur with his reading of decision making and consequent responsibilities.

Very briefly, it is not now possible to conduct an enquiry involving branch trading, Post Office Ltd or
client products without making an information request to Fujitsu. As we still do not own our own data
or the tools to analyse it we cannot circumvent Fujitsu in any way on this. Although IT (Keith Baines)
have been asked to look at the possibility of a data download for Security use this request has not
been progressed as a priority, I have asked Tony Utting to get this moving again with IT.

I am awaiting a breakdown of costs, I understand the cost of buying a further 420 information requests

I have received your reply and would contest that the decision to reduce our request numbers was
made in the Operations Directorate. The email below records that when I spoke to Keith Baines, he
suggested to me that the decision was made by the EC.

We now have 22 requests left to last us until January next year and are currently utilising them at a
rate of over forty per month in the expectation that the business was going to find funding for this.
Should we run out, then we there will be an impact on our ability to investigate crimes against the
business and in at least one case we may be in breach of a contractual obligation to investigate fraud
against a client product.

Has this issue been raised within the business from you side, as I have not been notified until today
that the extra requests were not going to happen.

This refers to the reduction, without any prior reference to anyone in my team, of the number of
pre-paid audit and investigation information requests agreed in the contract from 500 to 330. I had
previously agreed with Mike Hannon that our original figure of 750 (itself reduced from a rather
comfortable 1000) could be reduced to 500 provided that our bid for funding to cover any additional
requests would be met. We have a bid in for £50k for this purpose.

With the introduction of banking and the proposal to remove the hard copy cash account facility (which
lam disposed to endorse despite resistance from both my own investigators and Legal Services
provided that the retail line agrees to enforce compliance around Horizon passwords) every
investigation, whether full or preliminary, may require access to data held by Fujitsu.

I was surprised that such a change was made without any reference to the primary stakeholder.
Provided I have your commitment that POL will meet any additional costs which may be caused as a
result of this decision however I am comfortable if this has contributed to the reduction in the overall
Fujitsu contract costs.

I have today spoken with Keith Baines The Client Manager for Fujitsu, who tells me that the proposed
reduction in requests has been agreed at EC level (Dave Miller and co) and that the business is
aware, that should we exceed the number of requests in the contract, further resources will have to be
found by the business to pay for them.

The rationale behind the decision was that it was felt that we should not pay for anything in the
contract we did not use and there was no certainty that we would reach the previously agreed

Tony, Regarding the costs, yes the amount for the additional queries is still £170k. Please see small
table below, of how this was arrived at:

Increased No of Queries 390
Increased Price £170,000.00
Price per query £ 435.90
C2 Daily Rate” £ 1,039.00
C2 Hourly Rate £ 129.88
No of hours per query 3.36

The new annual limits will be 720 queries or 15,000 query days, which ever is reached first.

We have examined the proposed additional costs and consider this is not unreasonable, compared to \ 4
the charges for the existing facility ( which is 330 queries for the annual cost of £670k) x

* C2= Consultant 2 rates,( this is because all Fujitsu Services costs are based on consultancy
charges)

Tony, Further to your latest reply, I think the principal point in the various e-mails is Tony Marsh's
statement to Dave Miller in which he asks;"Provided I have your commitment that POL will meet
any additional costs which may be caused as a result of this decision however I am
comfortable if this has contributed to the reduction in the overall Fujitsu contract costs".What
was Dave Millers reaction to this statement?.

I still believe the additional funding is an operational matter which needs to be pursued with Dave

tam sure that it is nothing to do with your team and you may not be aware, but due to problems with
Horizon MIS, we have just had our first (hopefully not of many) request to provide audit data to the
Retail Line.

We are also currently issuing 46 requests per month, which will take us past our current yearly limit
somewhere around August, so can you confirm that we will be moving to the new increased levels as
discussed recently.

Should this not be the case, then we have a serious risk that we will be unable to undertake
investigative activity where Horizon data is required for a considerable period, until we are allowed a
new set of requests.

Thanks for you help

Further to the e mail below, Fujitsu have now finished checking all previously submitted ARQ's (only
those that have proceeded to prosecution) and have found errors (i.e. incomplete transaction/event
logs) in data supplied for another 4 offices. I am in the process of ascertaining at what stage these
prosecutions are at and the potential impact on the evidence. Hopefully, as with Forest Gate &

please see the e mail below from Bill Mitchell, Fujitsu Security Manager. Basically, some of the
transaction log requests we have submitted have been returned ‘incomplete’ due to human error on
their part. This could invite some criticism from Defence counsel in cases where the logs have been
used in evidence. Fujitsu are submitting ‘complete’ data with a supporting statement, so hopefully the
issue will not be a great problem

This is forwarded to you for your information and any action you deem appropriate from a commercial

Graham,

With reference to your emails dated today 25" May, I've noted the request for statements for ARQ 137
& 138 (St Kew Highway), the linking with ARQ 231 - 233 and the court date which is schedules for 4"
Sept 2004, I've ask Penny to contact you directly regarding these.

I've prepared the following update on the issues with ARQ for Forest Gate and Urmston, I have also
as far as is possible quantified the scale of the problem and actions we have already taken to restore
confidence in the quality of the information normally provided. The overall cause for the data being
omitted is regretfully operator error. I've detailed each FAD and corresponding ARQ below together
with an update as to the root cause.
Forest Gate: This request is split over 3 ARQ, No's 198, 199 & 200
ARQ 198 - The ARQ covers the period 14/10/02 to 13/11/2002, totalling 31 query
days. The root cause for the omission of data from this ARQ is that the retrieval was
executed as a single task with the resultant data retrieval exceeding the available 1Gb
limit of the Message Store area on the Audit Server. This forced the Audit Server to
randomly drop 11,135 data entries. A total of 10 days have been affected these dates
are:
16/10 - Partial, no end of day
17/10 - Partial, no end of day
19/10 - No data retrieved.
21/10 - Partial, no end of day
22/10 - Partial, no end of day
23/10 - Partial, no end of day

25/10 - Partial, no end of day
POLO00114566
POL00114566

26/10 - No data retrieved
29/10 - No data retrieved
30/10 - Partial, no end of day

ARQ 199: The ARQ covers the period 14/11/02 to 11/12/2002, totalling 28 query days.
The root cause for the omission of data from this ARQ is when an ARQ is retrieved it
is necessary to add additional days to the end of the requested date span to ensure a
full and complete capture of the data which may have been harvested at different
times. The operator should then confirm that an end of day log off is present and
extract only the required data files. In this case the operator added two additional
days to each ARQ, which is normally sufficient, but it appears did not confirm that an
end of day log off was present, consequently an additional 235 data entries were not
included in the data extraction. The affected dates are:

ARQ 198 - 27/11/2002 - Partial, no end of day

ARQ 200: The ARQ covers the period 12/12/2002 to 08/01/2003, totalling 28 query
days. The root cause for the omission of data from this ARQ was the same as ARQ
199 above and 679 additional data entries were not included in the data extraction.
The affected dates are:

ARQ 200 - 03/01/2003 - Partial, no end of day

We are currently repeating the exercise to extract the ARQ for Forest Gate and these
will be forward as soon as is practicable.

Rumson: This request equates to ARQ 320 only

ARQ 320 - The ARQ covers the period of the 03/01/2003, totalling 1 query days. The
root cause for the omission of data from this ARQ was the same as ARQ 199 above
consequently an additional 235 data entries were not included in the data extraction.
The affected date is:

ARQ 320: The ARQ covers the period 03/01/2003, totalling 1 query days. The root
cause for the omission of data from this ARQ was the same as ARQ 199 and 200
above and 796 additional 796 entries were not included in the data extraction. The
affected dates are:

ARQ 299 - 03/01/2003 - Partial, no end of day

The extraction of data for Rumson has already been repeated and dispatched to you.
This ARQ is now correct and only requires an additional statement to complete the
task.

In addition to the above we have checked the following other ARQs for which statements have been
requested. No discrepancies have been found

Ashford - ARQ 213 - 215

Borehamwood - ARQ 155 - 159, 201, 259 - 262, 278 - 281, 346 - 349
Carbis Bay - ARQ 231 - 233

Chigwell - ARQ 132

Dear Keith,

Audit Record Queries

POL00114566
POL00114566

Our Ref: CLS/jla/549

At the Commercial Forum held on 28 April 2004 you asked for information on increase
costs if Post Office Ltd were to exercise the option of increasing the number of Audit

Record Queries.

Further to the update I provided to Commercial Forum held on the 26 May 2004 Office Ltd

and action point 17.07 I can confirm the following principles:

1. Fujitsu Services would be able to accommodate a “one step” increase to revised
annual limits of 720 queries or 15,000 query days, which ever is reached first;
2. Old Format Queries and New Format Queries can be included in the above revised

limits, but with the differential Target Times remaining;

3. For DWP an additional 84 queries per annum can be accommodated, equivalent to
7 queries per month with a burst rate of 10 queries per month provided the annual

total doesn’t exceed 84;

4. The increase in the Security Management Service would be £170,000 per annum.
5. A notice period of I month is required to establish the new limits.

At present the number of queries is counted on a calendar year basis whilst the charge in on
a financial year basis ending 31 March. I would suggest that if the change to the revised
principles are agreed the query count period be changed to a financial year basis.

All other elements comprising the Security Management Service remain unchanged.

Please let me know if you require any further information.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Keith,
Audit Record Queries

At the Commercial Forum held on 28 April 2004 you asked for information on increase
costs if Post Office Ltd were to exercise the option of increasing the number of Audit
Record Queries.

Further to the update I provided to Commercial Forum held on the 26 May 2004 Office Ltd
and action point 17.07 I can confirm the following principles:

1. Fujitsu Services would be able to accommodate a “one step” increase to revised
annual limits of 720 queries or 15,000 query days, which ever is reached first;

2. Old Format Queries and New Format Queries can be included in the above revised
limits, but with the differential Target Times remaining;

3. For DWP an additional 84 queries per annum can be accommodated, equivalent to
7 queries per month with a burst rate of 10 queries per month provided the annual
total doesn’t exceed 84;

+ 4. The increase in the Security Management Service would be £170,000 per annum.

5. A notice period of 1 month is required to establish the new limits.

At present the number of queries is counted on a calendar year basis whilst the charge in on
a financial year basis ending 31 March. I would suggest that if the change to the revised
principles are agreed the query count period be changed to a financial year basis.

All other elements comprising the Security Management Service remain unchanged.

Please let me know if you require any further information.

As you can see we are in a difficult position this month and if something really serious were to
happened (as happened in April) we would be in severe difficulties.

Has there been any progress on getting us extra requests etc.
Thanks

Subject: DWP requests Horizon data

John

You may recall we spoke a couple of weeks ago regarding our limited access to Horizon data and the
pressure we are being out under to provide ever larger volumes in support of ongoing prosecutions
being undertaken by DWP.

To illustrate the point, please see below the schedule of requests we have received from DWP.
investigators over the past year, which shows that they are making increasing demands on this
resource. Some of the requests are dated as 1 June as that is when we are next able to request data
under the current contract.

We discussed previously asking Fujitsu to deal with all DWP requests separately and charge for each
individually, has this been progressed at all, as there is an opportunity here to relieve some of the
current pressure and we could find that they become more reasonable in their requests if they are
charged. At present, despite our own opinions about the possible validity of what they are asking for, it
is very difficult to argue in a court of law that the data is not necessary, when the prosecuting counsel
is the person who has asked for it to be provided. eglead

Bearing in mind the negative publicity that we and DWP regularly receive in the press, if one of these
cases were to fail because we could not, or would not provide the data as requested, then we would
be in the firing line. ¥.

Please get back to me if you need to discuss further

Thanks

Tony Utting

Subject: Horizon data

Thanks for the call now for the more difficult task of deciding how much we need to increase our
request numbers by.

You will see below some figures provided by Graham Ward from our casework team here at Croydon.
Graham manages the data requests from Fujitsu for ourselves and fends off as many as he can to
ensure that we do not go over our limits.

Estimating our requirements is difficult for a number of reasons, not least because we have asked
investigators to be selective in what they ask for due to the low number of requests we have available
to us.

Just for your information we raise something in the region of 1000 investigations each year, most of
which are never likely to get to a point whereby Horizon data becomes necessary, but potentially many
more will if we have the data available to us to examine (bearing in mind resource limitations etc).

The figures below relate to both our own and DWPs requests for this year and so far about a third of
the requests are from DWP. This has caused Graham to hold back, or refuse requests for our own
investigators and for other areas of the business.

We are also looking at the reduction in paperwork exercise currently in progress and estimate that in
the absence of some of the paper documentation we have relied upon in the past, that we will require
more data in the future in order to provide sufficient evidence to prove dishonesty. It is also possible
that the business may need to obtain audit data in order to refute claims, that transactions that have
caused errors to be raised did not take place as described in those errors.

From our experiences of the numbers of requests received from our team and the wider business we
estimate that to be sure of not hitting our limits in the future the request number should be raised to
720 per year and the number of days to 15000. This would not include the DWP requests, as they
should only have a need for data for the next year or so and so to include their requests may be an
unnecessary cost which could ore easily be dealt with by taking them out of our numbers and asking
Fujitsu to deal with and charge for them separately, on an ad hoc basis.

! can't promise that the figures we have given are in any way more than a guesstimate, as we
discussed earlier but I do believe that the numbers quoted above would allow us the flexibility to
ensure that we do not have to close down cases early simply because we cannot obtain the evidence
we require.

We are of course seeking a longer term solution of having direct access to all audit data, but
understandably that will take a little longer to achieve.

Thanks for your help, it was nice to have such a positive response to a problem that has grown
steadily more of an issue in recent months

I would be happy to meet up and discuss further if you think it would be helpful

Tony

as discussed & following the latest DWP request for 6 months data (which was originally 13 months
and may still be depending on the Judge's order), here is a forecast predicting likely numbers for the
year. If we continue at this rate we will use up all our requests within 7 months.

Thus far we have 54 requests in place totalling 694 days, 41 submitted and 13 waiting to go on the 01
May. This does not include the further 6 requests for the DWP which cover 182 more days. Adding all
these together comes to 60 requests - 876 days as of the 23/04/04.

If we continue at this rate we will be submitting approx : 952 requests this year which is 622 over the
contractual limit. We will also likely exceed the numbers of days (4620 per year), but this more difficult
to predict as some people want 31 days per request, others just a single day.

It is difficult to predict, but I would think that exercising the clause in the contract allowing Post Office
Ltd to increase its numbers of requests, would be a sensible option at this point in time.
