Ronan/Mike

I understand through Will that Alice has asked us to agree a defensive line if
pressed on the Cabinet Office commissioning the independent review (as advocated in Andrew
Bridgen quote yesterday).

How about?

‘This is an operational matter for Post Office Ltd who have already commissioned an independent,
external review by forensic accountants.’

Our final defensive lines

‘POL has already commissioned an independent, external review of a small number of individual cases in
light of these specific cases. Horizon has been rigorously tested over the years using robust, independently
assured processes.

‘POL have complete confidence in the robustness and integrity of its Horizon computer system and related
accounting processes. Ultimately though this is an operational and contractual matter for POL which
Government continues monitor."

If pushed on Cabinet Office review ...

POL already have independent reviewers for Horizon'
