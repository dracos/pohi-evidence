Group Definitions for the Secure NT Build

Requirement Definition

The ACP requires that access to Pathway systems be
controlled by the use of pre defined roles to which users can
be assigned. Such roles will allow users to access only those
parts of the system, with associated objects, they need in order
to complete the tasks associated with that particular role. This
document summarises this requirement and defines the roles,
with associated objects, domains and access requirements.

Release 2 Version: 4.0
Date: 22/12/98

1. Introduction

The nature of the Pathway system requires that access to the core systems should be
strictly controlled. [ACP] states that effective control depends on having a clear definition
of the roles and responsibilities of all personnel who need some form of access to the
system. Users will gain access by being assigned to these roles. This will be core to
Pathway implementing the principles of least privilege.

This document summarises the requirement and defines the human roles that will be
implemented for NT platforms; which objects will be used by each role; the domains each
role will function within; access point for the role; and associated privileges.

2. Scope

This document addresses the roles to be implemented as part of the Pathway central NT
systems and access rights assigned to each role.

3. Requirements

The requirement to implement a role based access control system emanates from [ACP].
[ACP] further defines the roles that are required for access to the Pathway Systems and
the responsibilities of these roles.

It should be noted that the Pathway solution has moved on since Version 2 of the ACP
was issued and, as such, the Groups defined at Appendix A do not always correlate with
the roles defined in [ACP]. This will be addressed by feeding these role definitions into
the current review of the ACP which will be subject to a CP once all necessary changes
have been agreed.

4. Implementation

Each role will be set up as a Group within NT. Individual users will be assigned to these
Groups in which access to objects, domains, servers and associated privileges will be
controlled. These Groups are defined in Appendix A.

Roles will have defined access points which will have an accompanying Platform Design
Document. Access to objects will be made available to each role at the relevant access
point.

The definition of the users will be held in a spreadsheet, or similar, and automated tools
will be used for the production of the relevant command scripts.

Human roles, as defined in this document, will be implemented using command scripts
that will be separate from the command scripts that implement service users. By doing
this, it will simplify the implementation and maintenance of the roles defined in Annex A.
Exceptions to this are those roles within the support services, ICL Outsourcing and SSC,
who will access toolsets via the command line. All roles only have authority to access the
toolsets specified in this document.

4.1 NT Administrator User

The Windows NT operating system is provided with a super user known as the
‘Administrator. This user has full administration and configuration privileges which is
exercised at both system/server and domain level. This capability cannot be removed
from Windows NT. Pathway recognises the power that this user has and the ability that a
human user, using the administrator user, has to interfere with the day to day operation of
the Pathway solution.

To address this issue, Pathway will limit and restrict the use of the NT Administrator User.

This will be achieved by:

> Renaming the Administrator User on all NT Servers so that it is hidden from the system.
The account name and password will be specified by the Pathway Security Manager,
which will be strictly controlled and stored in a secure safe.

> Restrict full administrator privileges to the ‘Operational Management’ role. Use of this
role will be subject to the management and procedural controls set out in the ‘Pathway
Code of Practice’, PA/STD/010.
