Martin/Jarnail,
Thanks for the meeting today ... most useful. I think I’ve captured salient points as follows:

Financial Investigations — Reconsideration Cases

e Dave outlined proposals to instigate reconsideration cases this financial year.

« Presentation shown (associated) which was delivered to the Sec Ops teams as a piece of
information share.

e Martin will speak to Philip Bown re the actual mechanics of getting a reconsideration case into court
(letter, summons, restraint on identified assets, etc?).

e Preferably some simple written guidance for Financial Investigators to follow or arrange meeting if
deemed appropriate.

Cartwright King Training Day — Tuesday 11" June (Cartwright King Birmingham)
¢ Agenda as per calendar invite discussed ... all topics clarified and agreed.
« Dave will send updated invites out (start 9.30 for coffee, 10.00 meeting, 15.00 close) ... though
with half hour lunch, close could be circa 14.30. This should prevent overnight stays.
¢ Current list of confirmed/possible attendees associated (though I suspect this may change).

Mock Trial Day — Wednesday 18" September (Crown Court Galleries Of Justice Nottingham)

e We discussed possible mechanics of the day — one trial utilising all delegates as witnesses or two
trials so as to have more ‘Investigator’ personnel giving evidence.

¢ Cartwright King and Post Office Ltd to consider cases and thoughts/ideas./etc ... and arrange
further meeting in July/August to finalise proposals.

e Martin indicated Cartwright King would participate in the role of barristers (wigs and all!).

¢ List of those to be invited associated ... I'll confirm attendees in due course.

e Dave will send invites out (start 9.30 for coffee, 10.00 mock trial(s), 17.00 close). Full day —
overnight stay on 18" September anticipated.

We also discussed further training day in December ... possible date 19"/20". We will discuss/confirm in
due course.

Regards,

Dave Posnett I Accredited Financial Investigator
