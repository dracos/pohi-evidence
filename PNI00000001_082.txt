I paid pension and allowance foils. Daily and or weekly summaries are I

prepared by sorting all paid foils into their respective group, in
ascending order of value, each group of foils is then machine add listed
with the total for each group, carried to the bpttom of the machine listing
to provide a‘summary of all group totals. Group totals, from all machine
listings for that accounting week, are entered onto the form
P2311(b)MA. Grand totals, for the individual group numbers, are
summarised on the Pensions and Allowances Summary P2311MA.

which identifies which offices are to be checked each week. This is
4 sdone on a ‘rota system’. Whilst conducting a routine ‘rota check’ of the
paid pensions and allowances foils despatched by Clanabogan Post
Office, overclaims were identified, on each of the weeks examined,
varying in value, from £0.40 to £148.00 . The overclaims were
generated by claiming non-existent pension and allowance foils.

The Post Office Ltd Investigation Team when appraised of the situation,
made arrangements to receive the paid pension and allowance
pouches, forwarded from Clanabogan Post Office to POU, Lisahally, on
behalf of the Benefits Agency.

} Local checks by the Post Office Ltd Investigation Team revealed
overclaims of a similar patter to those identified by the POU, Lisahally.
