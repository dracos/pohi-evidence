Dear Sirs

The Post Office Group Litigation
Known Error Log ("KEL")

Further to our letter dated 4 October 2017, we are able to confirm the arrangements for the meeting
between Fujitsu and the Claimants’ expert, Mr Coyne.

The meeting will be attended on behalf of Fujitsu by Pete Newsome (Post Office's account manager at
Fujitsu) and a member of the support services team. Fujitsu's preferred date/time for the meeting is
Monday, 9 October 2017 at 10am. Please confirm that your expert will attend this meeting.

As explained in our letter of 29 September 2017, the purpose of the meeting and the attendance of
Fujitsu at this is to enable Mr Coyne to understand the nature of the KEL and the relevance of the entries
it contains. If following his review Mr Coyne has any queries on the substance of these entries or
otherwise these should be placed in writing and addressed to Bond Dickinson.

In our letter dated 20 September 2017, we informed you that Fujitsu had asked for a non-disclosure
agreement to be signed to protect its confidential and commercially sensitive information. We have now
received drafts from Fujitsu. Accordingly, we enclose an individual confidentiality undertaking for Mr
Coyne to sign, together with a corporate non-disclosure agreement for IT Group Ltd. Since we/Fujitsu
are not aware of the capacity in which Mr Coyne is connected with IT Group Ltd (ie whether he is an
employee or contractor), you will see that this information needs to be completed within the relevant
documents. Routine information such as IT Group Ltd and Mr Coyne's address details also needs to be
inserted.

We should be grateful if you would attend to these details and then return the signed agreements to us
prior to the meeting between Fujitsu and Mr Coyne.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully

Adlck monly
