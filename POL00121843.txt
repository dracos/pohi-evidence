Subject: FW: Case Compliance

All,

The compliance checks on submitted offender interview case files will continue in 2012/2013.

Associated are all the supporting documents needed, which have been amended where appropriate.

I suggest these are referred to when you have time and/or when submitting an offender interview case file.
Some salient points and changes are summarised as follows, to take effect immediately where applicable;

e The timescales for submitting case files have increased from 12 working days to 15 working days (as a
maximum). This addresses the current lack of Security Managers, the impact on those assisting (extra travelling,
overnight stays, accrued TOIL, etc). This impact will continue for some time, even when new recruits are in
post. The increase to 15 working days (or 3 working weeks), coupled with continued use of the typing facility, is
considered fair in dealing with the current resource issues.

e Some scores have decreased and some have increased. Areas where there have been prevalent failings or
where it is considered that more importance or emphasis is needed have increased scores, whereas areas

POL00121843

deemed less significant have decreased scores. Please see Appendix 1 (Compliance Form) for all the relevant
scores available in future.

e All references to ‘Royal Mail’ have been replaced with ‘Post Office Ltd’. These include document references, GS
forms becoming POL forms and ‘Royal Mail Group Criminal Law Team’ becoming ‘Post Office Ltd Legal &
Compliance Team’.

e The Discipline Report template has been changed. Superfluous information for Contract Managers (e.g
Identification Code, HR printout at Appendix C, etc) has been removed. Also, areas of previous contention or
concern (such as ‘To be prosecuted by’, ‘Designated Prosecution Authority’, etc) has been removed. This is a
disciplinary report and no decisions have been made regarding any prosecution.

¢ The aim will again be to conduct a minimum of 2 compliance checks per individual and attain a 90% average
score across the team by year end. For info, the average score last year was 92.16%.

* Compliance checks will be lapsed for now and re-commence at the beginning of July. This will facilitate the
arrival of new recruits and any associated training, but will also provide some flexibility in managing workloads for
those impacted in the next couple of months. Casework will still continue to monitor the reporting timescales to
ensure we meet our stakeholder obligations.

This communication has been sent out now to inform you in advance of the changes in compliance and provide you with
the information needed on re-commencement of the compliance checks.
