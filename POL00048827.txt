Can you please ask Graham Brander to put in statement form what he says about his discussion with the
defendant after interview concerning her financial situation. He should explain why he asked the questions [for
the purpose of completing NPA 01 and CS033 forms] and indicate what questions were asked and what the
answers were. If he has a contemporaneous note he should provide it as unused material.

Thanks

Richard
