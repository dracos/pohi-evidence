Pouch 301209320891, containing £25,000 of £20 notes, was recorded twice at the branch (the clerk scanned the barcode only once
ut used the Prev key during the transaction) .

jthis has caused a £25,000 loss at the branch. The duplicate rem has also gone through to POL FS. Please send details to POL
ia BIMS.

POL have been informed of the error via BIMS ref 195511. Hopefully they will issue a TC to correct the loss at the branch.

jthe underlying problem, caused by using the Prev button during or just after scanning pouch barcodes, is still under
investigation.
