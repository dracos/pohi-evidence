I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL Pathway Ltd.,
since the 22" September 2003 as Security Manager where I am responsible for audit data
extractions and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised
by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system and to
obtain information regarding system transaction information processed on the Horizon system.

I have been asked to provide details and information on the reports that monitor faults, polling
failures, equipment failures and calls for advice and guidance logged by the Horizon System
Helpdesk recorded during the period from the 1* April 2002 to the 30" April 2003 for the
Shobnall Road Post Office - FAD Code 395207.

I have reviewed the helpdesk calls pertaining to this office and during the period 1% April 2002
to the 30" April 2003 there were 32 calls from Shobnall Road Post Office - FAD Code 395207
to the Helpdesk. I am of the opinion that none of these calls relate to faults which would have
had an effect on the integrity of the information held on the system. A breakdown of the calls

is given below:

1. Postmaster requesting help and advice on using Horizon System functions = 3.
2. Flood =3.

3. No Electrical Power = 2

3. Hardware problems = 6

4. Log On failure = 2.

20/01/03 the PM had a message asking her to declare cash on screen. Apart from this no
other issues were observed during the 2.5 hours the system was monitored by the FSM.
Resolution: SSC have not been able to find any indication of problems that might be caused
by software errors, however, the PM does not seem to be following the correct procedures for
balancing and ONCH declaration. Claims of transactions entered and then ‘lost’ from system
are not borne out by examination of message store and log files. PM advised, but is not happy

with the response.

Nick Crow has spoken to the PM who is still progressing the electrical issues, e.g. the removal
of a baby monitor, fax phone and other non-approved equipment from the counter, things are
now stable. The SCT were requested to monitor the site until Nick Crow has been to the site.

Road Post Office, FAD Code 395207 and the possibility that phantom transactions had taken
place.

The term phantom transactions has been used in this instance to describe an occurrence were
there is physical interference with input devices such as screens and keyboards; these have
been reported and diagnosed with root causes such as, cats or dogs jumping up and putting
paws on keyboards, people leaning over their keyboards and inadvertently pressing keys,
cables being drawn across keyboards, keys becoming stuck down & other items being left on
keyboards and in instances where system freezes have occurred the repeated pressing of
touch screen icon or keys on the keyboard which may be stored in the memory buffer and when
the system unfreezes entered into the system. There have been incidents where
electromagnetic interference has caused malfunction of computer touch-screens but this has
not produced substantive evidence that phantom transactions have been a consequence of
such interference.

Where alleged phantom transactions resulting from interference to input devices as described
above have occurred, they have generally resulted in multiple sales of one item and were
consistent with one key being held down, or the touch screen icons being pressed more than
once; in these cases the items were always sale items such as mobile phone cards or stamps,
etc. However, this would always be reflected in the weekly cash account as an imbalance of
either stock or cash. There is no evidence available to me to suggest this was the case with
Shobnall Road.

Where phantom transactions were reported on a regular basis Fujitsu/ICL field personnel would
recommend procedural measures to identify and contain the source of the transactions; these
measures would include the following:

1) Advising the Post Master that a manual balance of the office should take place every day.

This would act as a check when compared with the system derived report.

2) Where there were multiple counters and serving staff, advise the Post Master to adopt
individual Stock units, this is a method of compartmentalising losses arising from unexplained
transactions by ensuring that individual staff are tied to one accounting entity, the stock unit.

3) Where there was a suspicion that there may be electromagnetic interference suspect items

such as florescent tubes and alarm system components were replaced; chromeric collars,
small collars made from metal, that can commonly be found on many items of electrical wiring
such as computer monitor leads, were attached to the Horizon equipment.

This type of action was recommended at Shobnall Road, but according to record the
replacement of florescent tubes, replacement of alarm system components and installation of
chromeric collars was never implemented. In other cases when the above measures were
exercised all instances of interference were resolved. However, in the majority of cases 'user
error’ was eventually attributed to be the cause, in some cases a staff member left and the
phantom transactions stopped and in some other cases the PM did not pursue the complaint.

There are no recorded cases where losses could be attributed to either physical or
electromagnetic interference to the Horizon equipment and I am of the opinion that the

incidents reported as phantom transactions were at best ‘user errors’.

At various times between the 18" and the 23" March 2005 hardcopy printouts of the 32 calls
detailing the information recorded on the helpdesk database for the required date period were
produced. I now produce the hardcopy printouts as Exhibit WLM/14.

Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to the business of
Fujitsu Services. These were compiled during the ordinary course of business from
information supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be supposed to have personal
knowledge of the matter dealt with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any
recollection of the information or cannot be traced. As part of my normal duties, I have access
to these records.
