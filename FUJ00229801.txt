Thank you | appreciate your help. | thought we had already asked for formal help on this case but if this is

not the case then | do wish to process such a request - could you advise of the process for doing this

please? | absolutely need to be able to articulate what's happened here so given that you are probably the

person that can help formally | look forward to our future correspondence.

Thanks,

A few clarifications below prefixed [GIJ], but it doesn't cover everything you are asking.

Please note that this is all outside of our official remit. | probably shouldn't be doing this investigation for you in this
way. (Though if you ask for formal help, it is likely to be me who gets involved!)

Subject: RE: transaction log

Gareth,

Thanks for looking at this but this doesn't give me a complete explanation. What we don't have visibility of
is the session in between the transaction and the reversal 537804 - can we see what went through the
system against this number?

[GI] There was no such transaction. Session IDs do have gaps in them occasionally. When we get the raw logs
we will be able to show that number 537804 corresponded to the Log On request.

Also isn't there a log somewhere of what did actually fail - so if a break in Comms link isn't this recorded
somewhere?

[GU] This was certainly recorded at the counter at the time. However such logs are deleted after 28 days, so are of
no help to us now. There may also be Events written to system Logs at the time. These are normally retrieved at
the time an ARQ is done, but they are not normally passed on to POL. | can't be certain if they will show anything
or not but there is no harm in looking. They would also show whether or not the Counter was rebooted (which |
suspect it was).

Penny: Please can you also save the all the Event Files when you process this ARQ (same one as | mentioned
yesterday - details at end of email trail)

The Spmr is convinced that there is a problem with Horizon as he completed the transaction at the time
and other than the system not printing a receipt for the customer he believed all was well with the
transaction until several weeks later he learnt the customer's phone had been cut off for non-payment.

[GU] Not printing the receipt should have been an indication that something was wrong. As far as horizon is
concerned a Basket is not completed until all the receipts have been printed. (This could be a genuine mistake due
to lack of training or guidance, but it is not a fault with Horizon.) He also must have noticed that he needed to Log
On before carrying out any further transactions and a Recovery receipt should have been printed at that point.
The Events show that this was printed successfully.

The Spmr did not show a corresponding surplus on the day of the reversal which he should have as he
had taken the money but the bill wasn't subsequently processed. We need to be able to explain exactly
what's happened here and at the moment I'm unable to do this. Can you help me with this explanation? If
not could you suggest someone who can.

[GU] He could have seen the recovery receipt telling him about a Cash Refund for £76.09 and taken the money, but
| would have expected him to remember that!

That is the best | can do without the full evidence. | don't think anybody else is going to be able to provide a
better explanation.

Thanks for your help.

Helen,

Attached are the transactions and events for 4° October 2012 from 09:30 to 09:40 GMT (ie 10:30 to 10:40 BST).
FUJ00229801
FUJ00229801

This shows that Session 537803 was successfully saved to the BRDB, but when the user JAROO1 Logged On again

Recovery reversed the session in session 537805.

It isn't clear what failed, but if it was a comms error, then the system would have printed a disconnected session
receipt and the Clerk should have given the customer £80 and told him his Bill was unpaid. The fact that there is no
indication of such a receipt in the events table suggests the counter may have been rebooted and so perhaps may

have crashed in which case the clerk may not have been told exactly what to do.

The reversal was due to recovery (Counter Mode Id = 118) so this was not an explicit reversal by the clerk.

This scenario is fairly rare so it is certainly quite easy for the clerk to have made a mistake and either he or the

customer could be in pocket / out of pocket (depending on exactly what happened!).

The system is behaving as it should.

From the credence data it just looks like an AP transaction and 5 minutes later a reversal, however the
banking withdrawal went through for £80 and was debited from the customers account. PMR did a
banking withdrawal rather than payment by debit card. From the data | can see, | would have just said that

this was a reversal at the counter,

He denies transacting the reversal and has involved a forensic accountant to prove horizon fault.

| would have expected the office to be £76 up due to the reversal but it wasn't. (Customer was give the

change for £3.61 for the difference from the withdrawal and the BT bill)

I've tracked it down and it has been received here but not processed. I've asked if the raw lag can be returned as

well as the normal stuff so that | can confirm exactly what happened.

If you can show what you need from the normal extract then fine. If not | can probably help you find the info in the

raw log.
