Hi Jeff

Thank you for your email, I have been waiting since 18.2.22 for a response from Sree and have received nothing, this
is extremely disappointing.

I have several PM’s waiting for updates for these basic operating issues that have been raised, can you look into
resolving both issues asap please. - (Drop and Go postage log in & the new chip and pin process)

I have cc’d Lisa and Elliot into the email as they may also have suggestions.

Regards

Saf, can we discuss this Board action that Nick has asked me to look into please?
“SI touched on software and shared the example of a Postmaster investing time in undertaking a customer transaction only to
be told at the end of the transaction that the transaction was unsuccessful. SI advised that he had raised this with JS about 6
weeks ago. ACTION NR undertook to speak with JS on this.”

by!

I’m available at your convenience and get this resolved.
Thanks
jeff
