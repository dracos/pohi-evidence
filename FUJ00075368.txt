Ifhere are two APS Performance Measures :

01: APS Cash Payments - No Tokens Handed Back and

02: APS Cash Payments - Tokens Handed Back

IThe BO Reports however calculate the two performance measures as one - AOl.
lon investigating this appears to be due to incorrect mapping of the APS

IT refer to my previous statement

JAttached is a spreadsheet that was provided to define the suggested new
product mappings.

leven if the new mappings on the system are felt to be correct the
spreadsheet

suggests a discrepancy - AS IT SUGGESTS a new transaction_ID of

2 and transaction mapping APS - Cash Payments - Tokens handed back to
customer, whereas the table PPC_A06 MAP has a transaction type of 1 for this
Iand the other products listed below.

dditionally on reading DW/SLA/010 regarding this it states : ‘Tokens handed
back", Peter Robinson took an action to resolve with Customer
IRequirements/POCL the exact interpretation of ‘Tokens handed back' in
relation to transaction identification for SLAs as defined in E08.

However it also states that 'No Change is expected or proposed!

Referring to Team Leader for guidance as to whether this should be persued.

FAO Steve Newman,

steve, I accept that with the mappings as they stand there is ‘no fault in
product' as the software can do nothing but amalgamate the transactions. We,
jin system Test, can only test to a given snapshot of Standing Data and from
that perspective we must give it a tick in the box.

However, can this PinICL not now be used to question the correctness of the
mapping themselves? You advise in your response above (timestamp 15/12/2000
3:50:43) to let you know if we think there is a fault in the ref data - I
believe that Elaine is doing that. If you'd rather that PinICL was not the
freans by which to highlight this issue then please route the PinICL back for
closure, but we did use to use PinICL to raise comments against the old CON
standing Data

customer services have the responsibility and the tools to maintain the
lapping of POCL products to transactions types. As far as I am aware there
is no formally defined process to determine which transaction type should be
Jallocated to a product. This is a deficiency that Pathway should rectify.

so as to be able to progress this I would like to get a snapshot of the
current position in the live DWh. Please attach to this PinICL an extract,
from the live DWh, of the current mappings. This is effectively to repeat
ithe process that was run to produce the csv files that were used while
implementing CP2358.

the mappings for these products has changed. CS are allowed to change the
Juappings to whatever they see fit. One would hope that they have agreed the
content of the spreadsheet with POCL and then agreed any changes thereafter
las noted in the SLA Steering Group Meeting No. 8....

"Pb has provided design and mapping documentation to GW for review and
Iapproval prior to passing to POCL to provide the requested evidence that
pathway is moving forward on the calculation of volumetrics for the new
invoice. PR to do a sense check on the mapping. No obvious errors were
found. GW was asked to provide his approval. Action closed. PR will
lestablish the meaning of ‘tokens handed back’. PW will review the proc
for new products"

sw: Graham Wingrove, PR: Peter Robinson, PW: Paul Westfield.

Tf we assume that the Spreadsheet was agreed with POCL, then the mappings are
now incorrect - and this is the point of the PinICL. If, however, the
subsequent changes have also been agreed with POCL, then we can close the
PinICL

Martin's response does not cover the wider issue of agreeing our product
mappings with POCL. These mappings are used to determine which transactions
Iare measured against which performance measures and also determine how
transactions are totalled to create our monthly invoice volumetrics.

ny Errors in the mappings will cause Pathway to incorrectly state the
lfrigures that are declared to POCL.

therefore, we need to openly declare how we have mapped our products and
require a process in place that allows us to regularly review future mappings.
It believe that the action to put this process in place was finally with Steve
Muchow when the SLA Steering Group had its final meeting.

this is a hot issue with Tony Oppenheim who is concerned with the figures
that we will be reporting to POCL when we begin Monthly Invoice from April.

PAO: Peter Ambrose

Having checked our Rig and BTC's rig these products haven't been mapped as
lpart of the standard build.

l'e appreciate that given the realities of the real world we may well be out
lof step and that it is only where we have had fixed documentation that we
Jnave been able to highlight descrepancies as above which would affect live.
jiwhat I think may need to happen is for an exercise to be undertaken (as
Inappened about 18 months ago) documenting the live standing data and then our
test ‘standing data', as installed on build, to be as up to date as it can be
Iand conform to the documented norm.

In the absence of this, however, currently both myself and Neil Gormley map
jour own products to enable testing of this product type and SLA.

Elaine,

tt appears, as you suggest, that the only way anything will happen is to
identify real problems in live as part of a live/test reconciliation process.
It suggest that you either keep this PinICL in SystemTest 'futures' or close
it and document the future requirement for the test rigs.

Further to my conversation with Pete Ambrose today, it has been recognised
chat the standing data within live and test cannot be guaranteed to be the
same.

However, as we have no guidance on what is out in live we have no way of
testing for consistency and can merely prove that the data warehouse will
undertaken the calculations, aggregations correctly should products be mapped
in certain ways.

JAs for placing this PinICL in a ‘futures' stack or documenting the future
requirement again, having clarified with Peter, this is not feasible.
Isasically, we will test as thoroughly and efficiently as we can, but without
la definition of the ‘live' standing data (which will need to be kept up to
Jtate for each release and then the test rigs being built with this ‘live!
set) we will never be in the position to test the standing data itself and
nave to be content with testing that the system will process correctly based
upon our tests.

JAs such, I am to close this PinICL, the descrepancy first noted has been
Inighlighted and since dealt with.

Pete Ambrose advised he will investigate whether a process between CS and CFM
can be instigated to attempt to keep the build standing data and live
standing data in line.
