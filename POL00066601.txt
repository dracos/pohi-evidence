This case concerns an audit discrepancy at Walton on Thames Post Office, 73 Hersham
Rd, Walton on Thames, Surrey, KT12 1LN. The circumstances leading to the interviews
of those named in the preamble, and suspension for contract of services, are as follows.

On Friday 7" March 2003, I received a telephone call from Paul Dawkins, Investigation
Team Manager. I was informed that an audit was occurring at Walton on Thames Post
Office and the indications were that a substantial shortage within the accounts was going
to emerge. I then made arrangements to attend the office with Rob Fitzgerald,
Investigation Manager.

On arrival to the Post Office, I introduced myself and Rob Fitzgerald to the
Subpostmaster, David Yates, and informed him of the reason for our presence. I also
explained that prior to determining a course of action, I needed to speak with the Audit
Manager, Paul Bosson, in order to receive an appraisal of events thus far. Mr Yates
agreed that a rest room within the premises could be used to this effect.

Paul Bosson informed me that he had received a telephone call the previous day,
Thursday 6" March 2003, from Michael Dadra, Operations Manager within the Security &
Audit Team. The details of this call concerned discrepancies in post audit checks, relating
to Walton on Thames Post Office and an audit conducted on 15" November 2002. In
summary, part of the audit process involves the recording of remittances that have been
despatched from Post Offices. At some stage after an audit, checks are made against
figures that Subpostmasters claim to have been remitted out from their office, against
figures recorded as being remitted in by Cash Centres. It had been identified that the
alleged remittances on the audit of 15" November 2002 had not been declared as
received by the Cash Centre, or indeed recorded on the cash account submitted by
Walton on Thames Post Office. In effect, there was a discrepancy in the amounts sent
and the amounts received totalling £330,000.00.

Due to this discrepancy, Mr Bosson, accompanied by Sue Le May, Auditor, had attended
Walton on Thames Post Office on Friday 7" March 2003.

On commencement of the audit, Mr Bosson asked Mr Yates for a balance snapshot. This
document, obtained from the Horizon computer system, indicates the levels of cash and
stock that should be on hand. The snapshot was produced and a part copy is enclosed.
It can be seen that the cash figure is recorded as being £410,354.67.

Mr Bosson then asked Mr Yates to provide the office cash declaration from the previous
day, Thursday 6" March 2003. A cash declaration should be completed by outlets on a
daily basis, at the close of business, ensuring that the amount of actual cash on hand is
recorded. This document was located and provided to Mr Bosson. A copy is enclosed. It
can be seen that the total cash figure is recorded as being £43,566.00.

Clearly, there was a difference in the amount of cash that should have been on hand
(snapshot) and the amount of cash actually on hand (declaration). Accordingly, Mr Yates
informed Mr Bosson that a remittance had been despatched the previous day, Thursday
6" March 2003, but it had not been entered onto the Horizon system. This would have
explained why the snapshot was showing a much larger cash figure than the declaration.

In order to verify what Mr Yates had said, Mr Bosson then requested the Cash In Transit
(CIT) receipt book. This book details outward remittances and a signature is obtained
from the CIT officer who collects the remittance. On examination of the book, Mr Bosson
pointed out that the last entry concerned a remittance on Wednesday 5" March, not
Thursday 6" March. A copy of the last entry is enclosed.

For further verification, Mr Bosson asked Mr Yates for the P884 forms (subsequently
determined as being P5257MA forms). These forms are used by Subpostmasters to
detail a breakdown of all cash being remitted. The top copy of the forms are enclosed in
the relevant pouches and the undercopy of the forms are retained in the Post Office, for
audit purposes. It should also be noted that the maximum amount of cash, which can be
placed in a pouch, is £20,000.00 and a P5257MA should be completed for each pouch.
Accordingly, there should have been a number of P5257MA undercopies to reflect the
alleged remittance of the previous day.

Mr Yates claimed he could not find the forms. At this stage Mr Yates also informed Mr
Bosson that no remittance had been despatched the previous day and that the audit
would probably result in a shortage of some £350,000.00.

A report detailing the events so far was written by Mr Bosson and he and Mr Yates signed
the report. A copy of the report is enclosed. The matter was then referred to the
Investigation Team.

I then spoke to Mr Yates, inviting him to attend a tape-recorded interview and explaining
his legal rights and his right to have a friend present during the interview. I also cautioned
Mr Yates and he agreed to be interviewed.

At 12.10 hours I commenced a tape-recorded interview with Mr Yates. Also present was
Rob Fitzgerald. Mr Yates declined the right to seek legal representation or advice, or the
offer of a friend to be present during the interview.

The interview consisted of one tape (seal ref 046861) and was concluded at 12.54 hours.
A taped summary has been prepared and is associated.

Mr Yates admitted to inflating his cash figures for the past 3 to 5 years in order to conceal
an ever-increasing shortage. Given the length of time of this activity, he could not recall,
specifically, when this falsification of his accounts commenced or the amounts,
specifically, that had accrued over the period. He was aware that when completing the
last cash account, on Wednesday 5" March, he inflated the cash by £350,000.00.

With regards to why this activity had been occurring, Mr Yates claimed, at various points
during the interview, that cash was used to pay for losses, error notices, staff wages,
personal bills and repayments on loans. He further claimed that expenditure associated
with the Post Office and the retail area was exceeding his income, and that over time the
amount had ‘mushroomed’, culminating in a deficiency of £350,000.00.

Mr Yates claimed no one else was aware of what he was doing and that he had
completed the accounts each and every week over the past few years. He also admitted
to falsely claiming outward remittances at two previous audits (now known to have been
15" November 2002 and 23 May 2002).

A number of cash accounts were shown to Mr Yates during interview. Two of these
related to weeks 9, ending 29" May 2002, and 10, ending 5" June 2002. The signatures
on these accounts appeared to be different and Mr Yates claimed that his colleague,
Lindsey Smale, had signed the account for week 10. He further claimed that he trained
her on how to prepare the accounts and whilst she hadn't physically completed the
account, she had signed it.

Following the interview, I spoke with you and you indicated that Mrs Smale was making
her way to Walton on Thames Post Office. You informed me that Mrs Smale might be
considered with regards to running the outlet on a temporary basis, until the final outcome
of the investigation had been determined. You also informed me that Mrs Smale had
claimed to have completed the cash accounts in May/June 2002, when Mr Yates took a
vacation in the United States.

This obviously implicated Mrs Smale in the investigation, as Mr Yates claimed to have
falsified his accounts for the past 3 to 5 years and it therefore required an explanation as
to how a balance was achieved during these 2 weeks. It was decided that Mrs Smale
would be invited to attend an interview on her arrival to the office.

In the meantime, a search of the Post office was instigated. Mr Yates provided consent
for the search and a quantity of documents were seized. The search commenced at
14.00 hours and concluded at 15.15 hours. Paul Dawkins, Investigation Team Manager,
had also arrived by this stage.

Mrs Smale arrived and following introductions and the reason for our visit, I invited her to
attend a tape-recorded interview. I explained her legal rights and right to have a friend
present during the interview. Mrs Smale agreed to be interviewed.

At 15.38 hours I commenced a tape -recorded interview with Mrs Smale. Also present was
Rob Fitzgerald. Mrs Smale declined the right to seek legal representation or advice, or the
offer of a friend to be present during the interview.

The interview consisted of one tape (seal ref 046862) and was concluded at 16.00 hours.
A taped summary has been prepared and is associated.

On examination of the cash accounts for weeks 9 and 10, and in particular the signatures
on them, Mrs Smale agreed that they reflected Mr Yates period of absence and that she
had completed and signed them. She further claimed that Mr Yates informed her that
there was £250,000.00 within the safe, relating to a closed Post Office that was being held
by Walton on Thames Post Office. This figure was incorporated into the cash account for
both weeks, in addition to the other cash physically on hand. Mrs Smale stated she did
not have any concerns over this as she had known and worked with Mr Yates for many
years and she took what he had said to be true.

Following the interview of Mrs Smale, arrangements were made to attend the home
address of Mr Yates, in order for a search to be carried out. Mr Yates provided consent for
the search and a further quantity of documents were seized. The search commenced at
17.30 hours and concluded at 18.30 hours.

One item seized was the passport of Mr Yates. There is an immigration stamp indicating
that Mr Yates was in the United States from 25" May 2002. It was pointed out that during
interview, Mr Yates claimed he had not been away. Mr Yates stated he wasn't really
thinking straight. A part copy of the passport is enclosed.

Since the interview, I have examined all documentation in this case. Further
documentation has been identified as relating to the two audits in 2002.

Audit 23 May 2002 - Within the cash account file, was a quantity of P5257MA forms,
datestamped 23 May 2002. There are 15 such forms and the amounts on them total
£285,000.00. Copies of these and part of the relevant cash account for week 9, ending
29" May 2002, are enclosed. There is no outward remittance for the amounts on the
P5257MA's. A copy of the diary entry of 24"" May 2002 (item seized) is also enclosed,
annotated ‘David off 2 weeks USA until 12 June’.

Audit 15" November 2002 - On examination of the CIT book, there are 2 pages
datestamped 15" November 2002, detailing 16 pouches for collection. Copies of these
and a further page datestamped 13" November 2002, and the cash account for week 34,
ending 20" November 2002, are enclosed. It can be seen that the signatures on the CIT
book appear to be in the name of Peter Rodriguez, though the signatures are different.
There is no outward remittance for the pouches indicated.

In addition, you found Horizon printouts, whilst subsequently clearing the office with Mrs
Smale. These printouts detail a remittance of 15" November 2002, totalling £330,000.00,
and the subsequent reversal of this remittance on 20" November 2002. A copy of the
printouts are enclosed.

The final audit result was a shortage of £359,325.71. A report and breakdown of this
figure has been prepared by Mr Bosson, Audit Manager, and a copy is enclosed.

In respect of Mr Yates reasons for falsifying his accounts, it should be noted that due to
shortages being covered up, by the inflation of his cash, a true picture of actual shortages
accrued will be impossible to determine. In respect of error notices, 2 schedules are
enclosed. The first details all error notices since January 2000. The amount of charges is
indicated as £9,089.23 and the amount of claims is indicated as £12,293.73, thus implying
that Mr Yates has actually gained financially from the error notices. The second schedule,
Holding Account Analysis Report, details error notices since 1997, which, for various
reasons, have been written off by Post Office Ltd.

I have enclosed part copies of a selection of cash accounts. It should be noted that these
reflect cash accounts referred to during interview, the first account within the cash account
file obtained (week 30, ending 20" October 1999), other cash accounts over the past few
years and the last cash account produced by Mr Yates (week 49, ending 5" March 2003).

This report is submitted for your information and action as necessary.

This case concerns an audit discrepancy at Walton on Thames Post Office, 73 Hersham
Rd, Walton on Thames, Surrey, KT12 1LN. The circumstances leading to the interviews
of those named in the preamble, and suspension for contract of services, are as follows.

On Friday 7" March 2003, I received a telephone call from Paul Dawkins, Investigation

At 12.10 hours I commenced a tape-recorded interview with Mr Yates. Also present was

accrued will be impossible to determine. In respect of error notices, 2 schedules are
enclosed in Appendix C. The first details all error notices since January 2000. The
amount of charges is indicated as £9,089.23 and the amount of claims is indicated as
£12,293.73, thus implying that Mr Yates has actually gained financially from the error
notices. The second schedule , Holding Account Analysis Report, details error notices
since 1997, which, for various reasons, have been written off by Post Office Ltd.

These figures suggest that the financial difficulties cited by Mr Yates, in these areas, do
not equate to the amount of the loss in this case. Additionally, given that his Post Office
salary is £70,000.00 per year and the retail area of the Post Office provided £40,000.00
per year, the loss seems significantly larger than it already is.

There are no indications, within the items seized on the searches, that large funds have
been deposited into accounts or savings plans and Mr Yates does not appear to be ‘living’
beyond his means. Bank disclosure authority has been granted by Mr Yates, though this
information will take a while to obtain. In the meantime, it should be noted I am liasing
with Joe Ashton, Head Of Civil Litigation, with regards to the recoveries of monies owed.

It may be agreed that Mr Yates has clearly committed criminal offences during his period
as Subpostmaster. You will no doubt advise on possible charges in due course. I have
enclosed part copies of a selection of cash accounts at Appendix B. It should be noted
that these reflect cash accounts referred to during interview, the first account within the
cash account file obtained (week 30, ending 20" October 1999), other cash accounts over
the past few years and the last cash account produced by Mr Yates (week 49, ending 5"
March 2003). These may be of use if a selection of specimen charges are drafted in
relation to theft and/or false accounting, as the cash on hand figures are detailed within
the information.

In my opinion there are insufficient grounds to pursue a prosecution against Mrs Smale.
She made no incriminating admissions during interview, was only involved solely with 2
accounts, and whilst the amount of the loss is significant, there is no evidence to dispute
her version of events or that she was aware of the situation

The fact that Mr Yates activities have occurred at 2 previous audits provides cause for
concern. If this fraud had been identified and properly dealt with at either of these audits,
the loss in this case would have been significantly smaller. However, through liaisons with
Mr Bosson and my previous audit experience, the current processes seem to have been
adhered to. The auditors at these previous audits appear to have been duped through the
production of bogus pouches (contents unknown), CIT receipts and P5257MA forms.
Weaknesses in controls following the audits do appear to have contributed to no action
taken against Mr Yates activities. I am aware that Martin Ferlinc, Network Audit &
Inspection Manager, has instigated enquiries into the matter, with a view to identifying
weaknesses, reviewing processes and ultimately preventing this type of activity occurring
again.

Another area of concern involves the Inventory Management Team. This team receives
cash declarations and cash on hand information from outlets, for cash targeting and
monitoring purposes. My understanding is that the cash anomalies associated with
Walton on Thames Post Office should have been identified and flagged up by this team.
It may be agreed that enquiries should be instigated by the Inventory Management Team,
in order to establish if weaknesses in their procedures have contributed to this fraud
continuing without detection.

In accordance with Casework Management guidelines, a copy of this report, the taped
summaries and a revised/factual report, for the attention of the Discipline Manager, Elaine
Wright, have been emailed to S&A Casework, for distribution as appropriate.

The Working Tapes of the interviews are enclosed at Appendix B. The Master Tapes
have been retained by me.

All original exhibits in this case have been retained by me with photocopies, where
applicable, being enclosed at Appendix B.

This case is submitted for the current position to be seen and noted and for consideration

I am employed by Post Office Ltd and have been since 1986. My job title is Investigation Manager and my
responsibilities are to lead and assist investigations into suspected criminal offences committed against
the business by its employees, agents and staff.

On Friday 7" March 2003, I was informed that an audit of the accounts was being conducted at Walton on
Thames Post Office, 73 Hersham Road, Walton on Thames, Surrey, KT12 1LN, and that there were
indications a substantial deficiency of cash would emerge. I made arrangements to attend the Post
Office, with my colleague, Rob Fitzgerald.

On arrival at the office, I introduced myself and Rob Fitzgerald to the Subpostmaster, Mr David Yates, and
explained that the reason for our presence was in connection with the audit being carried out. I informed
Mr Yates that I wished to speak with the Audit Manager, Mr Paul Bosson, prior to determining a course of

action.

Following my conversation with Paul Bosson, I cautioned Mr Yates and invited him to attend a tape
recorded interview. I also explained his legal rights and his right to have a friend present during the
interview. Mr Yates agreed to be interviewed.

At 1210 hours I commenced a tape recorded interview with Mr Yates, within an office at Walton on
Thames Post Office. Also present was Rob Fitzgerald, Investigation Manager. The interview consisted of
one tape. I now produce form CS001, relating to Mr Yates’ legal rights as itemDP/1. I also produce the
master tape for this interview (bearing seal number 046861) as itemDP/2 and the taped summary of this

interview as item DP/3.

Continuation of statement of Dave Posnett

Following this interview, a search of the Post Office secure area was conducted. The search was
undertaken by Rob Fitzgerald and Paul Dawkins, Investigation Team Manager, who had subsequently
arrived at the office. The search commenced at 1400 hours and was completed at 1515 hours. All items

seized during the search were recorded on form CS005, which I now produce as itemDP/4.

Mr Yates also agreed to a search of his home address of,
and Paul Dawkins. The search commenced at 1730 hours and was completed at 180 hours. All items

and arrangements were made to attend the address. The search was undertaken by Rob Fitzgerald

seized during the search were recorded on form CS005, which I now produce as itemDP/5.

Most transactions performed by a Post Office are checked at some stage thereafter and there are

occasions when errors are identified. An example of such an error could be if a customer deposits £100
into a personal Girobank account, but the Subpostmaster enters the transaction on the Horizon system as
£10. When Girobank receive the customers deposit slip, they will reconcile the transaction with details

supplied by the Post Office. They will note that the Post Office has made an error and an ‘error notice’ will
be generated. The ‘charge’ error notice is despatched to the Post Office where the transaction occurred
and the Subpostmaster is required to financially make good the error and record this within the accounts.
Errors work both ways and ‘claim’ error notices are also issued to Post Offices, whereby a Subpostmaster
is permitted to withdraw cash that is proper to him. Records of error notices relating to all Post Offices are
maintained at the Post Office Ltd, Accounts Division, Chesterfield.

Due to my position as Investigation Manager, I have access to records relating to the business of Post
Office Ltd. As part of further enquiries, I obtained a record of error notices in relation to Walton on
Thames Post Office. These records consist of two schedules. The first schedule details error notices
covering the period January 2000 to December 2002. I now produce this schedule as itemDP/6. The
second schedule details error notices covering the period 1997 to 2001. I now produce this schedule as
item DP/7.

Post Office accounting weeks run from Thursday to Wednesday and are referred to as Cash Account
Periods (CAP’s). After the close of business on Wednesdays, a balance of all cash, stock and
transactions is conducted, which culminates in a cash account being produced from the Horizon computer
system. This is the official accounting document produced each CAP and one cash account is
despatched to Chesterfield and another is retained within the Post Office.

Continuation of statement of Dave Posnett

Whilst at Walton on Thames Post Office I obtained the cash accounts. On further examination of these
documents, I can say that that they reflect the period from October 1999 through to March 2003, though a
number of CAP’s appear to be missing. I now produce these cash accounts as itemDP/8.

Most of the cash accounts are contained within a folder and whilst examining this folder, I noticed a

quantity of P5257MA forms. These are remittance advice notes, completed in duplicate, and

Subpostmasters are required to complete these forms when they rem out cash from their Post Office.

The advice notes should be placed into a secure pouch with the cash they relate to, prior to collection from
the Cash In Transit team. I know from experience that the maximum amount of cash that can be placed
into a secure pouch is £20,000.00 and an advice note should be prepared for each pouch being remmed.

There were 15 advice notes, datestamped 23° May 2002, relating to CAP 09 and totalling £285,000.00. I
now produce these advice notes as itemDP/9.

I am aware that an audit of the accounts was completed at Walton on Thames Post Office on 28 May
2002 (exhibit MD/1 refers). On examination of the cash account relating to this date (CAP 09), specifically
the ‘Table 9 Rems To ADC’, at page 5, a cash amount of £40,000.00 is recorded at being remmed out,
not £285,000.00.

I am also aware that an audit of the accounts was completed at Walton on Thames Post Offie on 15”
November 2002 (exhibit MD/2 refers). On examination of the Cash In Transit collections book (exhibit
PB/3) for the 15" November 2002, there are 16 pouches indicated as being remmed out from the Post
Office, detailed on 2 pages. The signatures on these pages appear to be in the name of ‘Peter
Rodrigues’. A further remittance on 13” November 2002, detailing 2 pouches remmed out, also appears
to contain a signature in the name of ‘Peter Rodrigues’, but this signature is different from the signaures
of 15" November 2002. On examination of the cash account relating to this date (CAP 34), specifically
the ‘Table 9 Rems To ADC’, at page 5, a cash amount of £20,000.00 is recorded as being remmed out.

Certain records to which I refer in this statement form part of the records relating to the business of Post
Office Ltd and were compiled during the ordinary course of business, from information supplied by
persons who have, or may reasonably be supposed to have, personal knowledge of the matter dealwith
in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the information.

Signature Paul Bosson

I am a Network Audit Manager, employed by Post Office Ltd, and I have been so for approximately 16
years. My duties include the verification of cash and stock by undertaking audits at all Post Office Ltd
outlets. I can confirm that on Friday 7 March 2003, myself and Sue Le May (Network Auditor) arrived at
Walton on Thames Post Office, Hersham Road, Walton on Thames, Surrey, KT12 1LN, in order to
conduct an audit of the accounts. This audit was instigated by Michael Dadra, Security And Audit
Operations Manager, following discrepancies identified in post-audit checks resulting from a previous
audit conducted on 15" November 2002. The audit commenced at approximately 0855 hours.

All Post Office outlets operate with the Horizon computerised accounting system. All transactions,
declarations, balancing processes etc must be performed on the Horizon system.

As part of the audit process, an office snapshot is obtained from the Horizon system. The office snapshot
is a report, which can be printed, and details all the cash, stock and vouchers which should be on hand
and all transactions which have been entered onto the system. A physical check of the cash, stock and
vouchers is then conducted and compared to the office snapshot, in order to verify that all items are

present. The user of the Horizon system has to enter the amount of cash on hand when a balance is

performed (usually Wednesdays) and the Horizon system takes into account all receipts and payments

entered throughout the following week, thus it continually calculates how much cash should physically be
on hand.

I asked the Subpostmaster of Walton on Thames Post Office, Mr David Yates, to produce an office
snapshot from the Horizon computer system. This was done and I nowproduce this report as item PB/1.

Continuation of statement of Paul Bosson

It is also a requirement for Subpostmasters to physically declare the amount of cash they are holding on a
daily basis. This procedure should be performed before the close of business each day. Once the cash
has been declared, a printout of this declaration should be obtained from the Horizon system.

I asked Mr Yates to produce the office cash declaration which should have been obtained the previous

day, Thursday 6” March. This was done and I now produce this repott as item PB/2.

Following an examination of the office snapshot and the office cash declaration, it was evident that the
cash figures differed significantly. The office snapshot, which indicates the amount of cash that should be
on hand, detailed £410,354.67 (four hundred and ten thousand, three hundred and fifty four pounds, sixty
seven pence). The office cash declaration, which indicates how much cash is physically on hand, detailed
£43,566.00 (forty three thousand, five hundred and sixty six pounds).

Mr David Yates then informed me that he had sent a remittance the previous day (Thursday 6" March
2003), but had not booked it out on the Horizon system. A remittance is performed when an office has
excess cash, mutilated cash, obsolete stock etc. Such items are booked out on the Horizon system and
enclosed in secure pouches with remittance advice notes (formerly referenced as P884's, now referenced
as P5257MA’s). The advice notes should be completed by the Subpostmaster in duplicate and they detail
a breakdown of the items being remmed. The top copy is placed within the secure pouch and the

undercopy should be retained and archived at the Post Office.

Any pouches to be remmed should also be recorded in the Cash In Transit (CIT) collections book. Each
pouch has a serial number and these numbers should be recorded in the CIT book and the book should
be datestamped. The CIT book is carbonised, with 5 copies of collection receipts subsequently containing
the details of a remittance. The Subpostmaster arranges for a secure collection of the remittance and

when the CIT officer attends the Post Office, he should sign, time and date the CIT book as an

acknowledgement that the pouches have been taken. Two copies of the CIT book collection receipts are
left with the Subpostmaster, the top copy, which should be retained and archived at the Post Office, and a
further copy, which remains in the CIT book.

I asked Mr Yates to show me the CIT collections book. On examination of the book, I noted that the last
collection was dated Wednesday 8” March 2003 (not Thursday 6" March 2003). I now produce the CIT
collection book as item PB/3.

me that he could not find them, but then claimed he had not sent a remittance and that the audit would
result in a shortage of approximately £350,000.00.

I made a note of the events thus far and asked Mr Yates to sign this note. I now produce this note as item

PB/4. The matter was then referred to other managers within Post Office Ltd.

The audit of the accounts continued and resulted in a shortage of £359,325.71. The audit accounting
form P32 was completed by myself and I now produce this as itemPB/5. I also submitted a report of the

audit to Dave Posnett, Investigation Manager, which I now produce as itemPB/6.

This case concerns an audit discrepancy at Walton on Thames Post Office, 73 Hersham
Rd, Walton on Thames, Surrey, KT12 1LN. The circumstances leading to the interviews
of those named in the preamble, and suspension for contract of services, are as follows.

On Friday 7" March 2003, I received a telephone call from Paul Dawkins, Investigation
Team Manager. I was informed that an audit was occurring at Walton on Thames Post
Office and the indications were that a substantial shortage within the accounts was going
to emerge. I then made arrangements to attend the office with Rob Fitzgerald,
Investigation Manager.

On arrival to the Post Office, I introduced myself and Rob Fitzgerald to the
Subpostmaster, David Yates, and informed him of the reason for our presence. I also
explained that prior to determining a course of action, I needed to speak with the Audit
Manager, Paul Bosson, in order to receive an appraisal of events thus far. Mr Yates
agreed that a rest room within the premises could be used to this effect.

Paul Bosson informed me that he had received a telephone call the previous day,
Thursday 6" March 2003, from Michael Dadra, Operations Manager within the Security &
Audit Team. The details of this call concerned discrepancies in post audit checks, relating
to Walton on Thames Post Office and an audit conducted on 15" November 2002. In
summary, part of the audit process involves the recording of remittances that have been
despatched from Post Offices. At some stage after an audit, checks are made against
figures that Subpostmasters claim to have been remitted out from their office, against
figures recorded as being remitted in by Cash Centres. It had been identified that the
alleged remittances on the audit of 15" November 2002 had not been declared as
received by the Cash Centre, or indeed recorded on the cash account submitted by
Walton on Thames Post Office. In effect, there was a discrepancy in the amounts sent
and the amounts received totalling £330,000.00.

Due to this discrepancy, Mr Bosson, accompanied by Sue Le May, Auditor, had attended
Walton on Thames Post Office on Friday 7" March 2003.

On commencement of the audit, Mr Bosson asked Mr Yates for a balance snapshot. This
document, obtained from the Horizon computer system, indicates the levels of cash and
stock that should be on hand. The snapshot was produced and a part copy is enclosed at
Appendix B. It can be seen that the cash figure is recorded as being £410,354.67.

Mr Bosson then asked Mr Yates to provide the office cash declaration from the previous
day, Thursday 6" March 2003. A cash declaration should be completed by outlets on a
daily basis, at the close of business, ensuring that the amount of actual cash on hand is
recorded. This document was located and provided to Mr Bosson. A copy is enclosed at
Appendix B. It can be seen that the total cash figure is recorded as being £43,566.00.

Clearly, there was a difference in the amount of cash that should have been on hand
(snapshot) and the amount of cash actually on hand (declaration). Accordingly, Mr Yates
informed Mr Bosson that a remittance had been despatched the previous day, Thursday
6" March 2003, but it had not been entered onto the Horizon system. This would have
explained why the snapshot was showing a much larger cash figure than the declaration.

In order to verify what Mr Yates had said, Mr Bosson then requested the Cash In Transit
(CIT) receipt book. This book details outward remittances and a signature is obtained
from the CIT officer who collects the remittance. On examination of the book, Mr Bosson
pointed out that the last entry concerned a remittance on Wednesday 5" March, not
Thursday 6" March. A copy of the last entry is enclosed at Appendix B.

For further verification, Mr Bosson asked Mr Yates for the P884 forms (subsequently
determined as being P5257MA forms). These forms are used by Subpostmasters to
detail a breakdown of all cash being remitted. The top copy of the forms are enclosed in
the relevant pouches and the undercopy of the forms are retained in the Post Office, for
audit purposes. It should also be noted that the maximum amount of cash, which can be
placed in a pouch, is £20,000.00 and a P5257MA should be completed for each pouch.
Accordingly, there should have been a number of P5257MA undercopies to reflect the
alleged remittance of the previous day.

Mr Yates claimed he could not find the forms. At this stage Mr Yates also informed Mr
Bosson that no remittance had been despatched the previous day and that the audit
would probably result in a shortage of some £350,000.00.

A report detailing the events so far was written by Mr Bosson and he and Mr Yates signed
the report. A copy of the report is enclosed at Appendix B. The matter was then referred
to the Investigation Team.

I then spoke to Mr Yates, inviting him to attend a tape-recorded interview and explaining
his legal rights and his right to have a friend present during the interview. I also cautioned
Mr Yates. Rob Fitzgerald made a notebook entry, detailing this conversation. A copy of
the notebook entry is enclosed at Appendix C. Mr Yates agreed to be interviewed.

At 12.10 hours I commenced a tape-recorded interview with Mr Yates. Also present was
Rob Fitzgerald. Mr Yates declined the right to seek legal representation or advice and a
copy of form CS001 is enclosed at Appendix B to this effect. He also declined the offer of
a friend to be present during the interview and a copy of form CS003 is enclosed at
Appendix C to this effect.

The interview consisted of one tape (seal ref 046861) and was concluded at 12.54 hours.
A taped summary has been prepared and associated at pages to of these papers.

Mr Yates admitted to inflating his cash figures for the past 3 to 5 years in order to conceal
an ever-increasing shortage. Given the length of time of this activity, he could not recall,
specifically, when this falsification of his accounts commenced or the amounts,
specifically, that had accrued over the period. He was aware that when completing the
last cash account, on Wednesday 5" March, he inflated the cash by £350,000.00.

With regards to why this activity had been occurring, Mr Yates claimed, at various points
during the interview, that cash was used to pay for losses, error notices, staff wages,
personal bills and repayments on loans. He further claimed that expenditure associated
with the Post Office and the retail area was exceeding his income, and that over time the
amount had ‘mushroomed’, culminating in a deficiency of £350,000.00.

Mr Yates claimed no one else was aware of what he was doing and that he had
completed the accounts each and every week over the past few years. He also admitted
to falsely claiming outward remittances at two previous audits (now known to have been
15" November 2002 and 23 May 2002).

A number of cash accounts were shown to Mr Yates during interview. Two of these
related to weeks 9, ending 29" May 2002, and 10, ending 5" June 2002. The signatures
on these accounts appeared to be different and Mr Yates claimed that his colleague,
Lindsey Smale, had signed the account for week 10. He further claimed that he trained
her on how to prepare the accounts and whilst she hadn't physically completed the
account, she had signed it.

Following the interview, I spoke with Elaine Wright, Retail Line Manager, who indicated
that Mrs Smale was making her way to Walton on Thames Post Office. I was informed
that Mrs Smale might be considered with regards to running the outlet on a temporary
basis, until the final outcome of the investigation had been determined. I was also
informed that Mrs Smale had claimed to have completed the cash accounts in May/June
2002, when Mr Yates took a vacation in the United States.

This obviously implicated Mrs Smale in the investigation, as Mr Yates claimed to have
falsified his accounts for the past 3 to 5 years and it therefore required an explanation as
to how a balance was achieved during these 2 weeks. It was decided that Mrs Smale
would be invited to attend an interview on her arrival to the office.

In the meantime, a search of the Post office was instigated. Mr Yates provided consent
for the search and a copy of forms CS005 and CSOOSiii are enclosed at Appendix B. A
quantity of documents were seized as detailed on the forms. The search commenced at
14.00 hours and concluded at 15.15 hours. Paul Dawkins, Investigation Team Manager,
had also arrived by this stage.

Mrs Smale arrived and following introductions and the reason for our visit, I invited her to
attend a tape-recorded interview. I explained her legal rights and right to have a friend
present during the interview. Rob Fitzgerald made a notebook entry, detailing this
conversation. A copy of the notebook entry is enclosed at Appendix C. Mrs Smale
agreed to be interviewed.

At 15.38 hours I commenced a tape-recorded interview with Mrs Smale. Also present was
Rob Fitzgerald. Mrs Smale declined the right to seek legal representation or advice and a
copy of form CS001 is enclosed at Appendix B to this effect. She also declined the offer
of a friend to be present during the interview and a copy of form CS003 is enclosed at
Appendix C to this effect.

The interview consisted of one tape (seal ref 046862) and was concluded at 16.00 hours.
A taped summary has been prepared and associated at pages to of these papers.

On examination of the cash accounts for weeks 9 and 10, and in particular the signatures
on them, Mrs Smale agreed that they reflected Mr Yates period of absence and that she
had completed and signed them. She further claimed that Mr Yates informed her that
there was £250,000.00 within the safe, relating to a closed Post Office that was being held
by Walton on Thames Post Office. This figure was incorporated into the cash account for
both weeks, in addition to the other cash physically on hand. Mrs Smale stated she did
not have any concerns over this as she had known and worked with Mr Yates for many
years and she took what he had said to be true.

Following the interview of Mrs Smale, arrangements were made to attend the home
address of Mr Yates, in order for a search to be carried out. Mr Yates provided consent for
the search and a copy of forms CS005 and CSO0S5iii are enclosed at Appendix B. A
further quantity of documents were seized as detailed on the forms. The search
commenced at 17.30 hours and concluded at 18.30 hours.

It can be seen against entry 13 (item RF/16) on the CSOOS5iii, that in relation to the
passport seized, there is an immigration stamp indicating that Mr Yates was in the United
States from 25" May 2002. Mr Fitzgerald pointed out that during interview, Mr Yates
claimed he had not been away. Mr Yates stated he wasn’t really thinking straight. A part
copy of the passport is enclosed at Appendix B.

Since the interview, I have examined all documentation in this case. Further
documentation has been identified as relating to the two audits in 2002.

Audit 23 May 2002 - Within the cash account file, was a quantity of P5257MA forms,
datestamped 23 May 2002. There are 15 such forms and the amounts on them total
£285,000.00. Copies of these and part of the relevant cash account for week 9, ending
29" May 2002, are enclosed at Appendix B. There is no outward remittance for the
amounts on the P5257MA’s. A copy of the diary entry of 24" May 2002 (item RF/10) is
also enclosed at Appendix B, annotated ‘David off 2 weeks USA until 12 June’.

Audit 15" November 2002 — On examination of the CIT book, there are 2 pages
datestamped 15" November 2002, detailing 16 pouches for collection. Copies of these
and a further page datestamped 13" November 2002, and the cash account for week 34,
ending 20" November 2002, are enclosed at Appendix B. It can be seen that the
signatures on the CIT book appear to be in the name of Peter Rodriguez, though the
signatures are different. There is no outward remittance for the pouches indicated.

In addition, Elaine Wright, Retail Line Manager, has found Horizon printouts, whilst
subsequently clearing the office with Mrs Smale. These printouts detail a remittance of
15" November 2002, totalling £330,000.00, and the subsequent reversal of this remittance
on 20" November 2002. A copy of the printouts are enclosed at Appendix B.

The final audit result was a shortage of £359,325.71. A report and breakdown of this

figure has been prepared by Mr Bosson, Audit Manager, and a copy is enclosed at
Appendix C.

In respect of Mr Yates reasons for falsifying his accounts, it should be noted that due to
shortages being covered up, by the inflation of his cash, a true picture of actual shortages
accrued will be impossible to determine. In respect of error notices, 2 schedules are
enclosed in Appendix C. The first details all error notices since January 2000. The
amount of charges is indicated as £9,089.23 and the amount of claims is indicated as
£12,293.73, thus implying that Mr Yates has actually gained financially from the error
notices. The second schedule , Holding Account Analysis Report, details error notices
since 1997, which, for various reasons, have been written off by Post Office Ltd.

These figures suggest that the financial difficulties cited by Mr Yates, in these areas, do
not equate to the amount of the loss in this case. Additionally, given that his Post Office
salary is £70,000.00 per year and the retail area of the Post Office provided £40,000.00
per year, the loss seems significantly larger than it already is.

There are no indications, within the items seized on the searches, that large funds have
been deposited into accounts or savings plans and Mr Yates does not appear to be ‘living’
beyond his means. Bank disclosure authority has been granted by Mr Yates, though this
information will take a while to obtain. In the meantime, it should be noted I am liasing
with Joe Ashton, Head Of Civil Litigation, with regards to the recoveries of monies owed.

It may be agreed that Mr Yates has clearly committed criminal offences during his period
as Subpostmaster. You will no doubt advise on possible charges in due course. I have
enclosed part copies of a selection of cash accounts at Appendix B. It should be noted
that these reflect cash accounts referred to during interview, the first account within the
cash account file obtained (week 30, ending 20" October 1999), other cash accounts over
the past few years and the last cash account produced by Mr Yates (week 49, ending 5"
March 2003). These may be of use if a selection of specimen charges are drafted in
relation to theft and/or false accounting, as the cash on hand figures are detailed within
the information.

In my opinion there are insufficient grounds to pursue a prosecution against Mrs Smale.
She made no incriminating admissions during interview, was only involved solely with 2
accounts, and whilst the amount of the loss is significant, there is no evidence to dispute
her version of events or that she was aware of the situation

The fact that Mr Yates activities have occurred at 2 previous audits provides cause for
concern. If this fraud had been identified and properly dealt with at either of these audits,
the loss in this case would have been significantly smaller. However, through liaisons with
Mr Bosson and my previous audit experience, the current processes seem to have been
adhered to. The auditors at these previous audits appear to have been duped through the
production of bogus pouches (contents unknown), CIT receipts and P5257MA forms.
Weaknesses in controls following the audits do appear to have contributed to no action
taken against Mr Yates activities. I am aware that Martin Ferlinc, Network Audit &
Inspection Manager, has instigated enquiries into the matter, with a view to identifying
weaknesses, reviewing processes and ultimately preventing this type of activity occurring
again.

Another area of concern involves the Inventory Management Team. This team receives
cash declarations and cash on hand information from outlets, for cash targeting and
monitoring purposes. My understanding is that the cash anomalies associated with
Walton on Thames Post Office should have been identified and flagged up by this team.
It may be agreed that enquiries should be instigated by the Inventory Management Team,
in order to establish if weaknesses in their procedures have contributed to this fraud
continuing without detection.

In accordance with Casework Management guidelines, a copy of this report, the taped
summaries and a revised/factual report, for the attention of the Discipline Manager, Elaine
Wright, have been emailed to S&A Casework, for distribution as appropriate.

The Working Tapes of the interviews are enclosed at Appendix B. The Master Tapes
have been retained by me.

All original exhibits in this case have been retained by me with photocopies, where
applicable, being enclosed at Appendix B.

This case is submitted for the current position to be seen and noted and for consideration
to the prosecution aspects of this case.

Tam employed by the Post Office and have been so for over 19 years. I currently perform the
duties of Investigation Manager (IM) for Post Office Ltd (PO Ltd), and as such I am responsible

for carrying out investigations into possible criminal offences against the business.

As part of my duties, on the Friday 7 March 2003, I attended Walton On Thames Modified Scale
Payment Sub Post Office (MSPO). Which is located at 73 Hersham Road Walton On Thames
Surrey, with my colleague Dave Posnett (IM). On arrival I was present when Mr Posnett
introduced himself to a person I now know to be David Yates. Mr Posnett then spoke with a
member of the audit team to clarify the discrepancy identified within the office accounts.
Following this Mr Posnett cautioned Mr Yates and asked if he would attend a tape recorded
interview that day. Mr Posnett then informed Mr Yates of his legal right to have a solicitor and of
his additional post office right to having a friend present throughout the interview. These events

were recorded in my notebook.

I was present throughout the tape recorded interview which commenced at 12.10 hours and

terminated at 12.54 hours.

Following this I conducted a search of the Post Office secure area. This search commenced at

14.00 hours and terminated at 15.15 hours. During the search I seized a number of items, which

This case concerns an audit discrepancy at Walton on Thames Post Office, 73 Hersham
Rd, Walton on Thames, Surrey, KT12 1LN. The circumstances leading to the interviews
of those named in the preamble, and suspension for contract of services, are as follows.

On Friday 7" March 2003, I received a telephone call from Paul Dawkins, Investigation
Team Manager. I was informed that an audit was occurring at Walton on Thames Post
Office and the indications were that a substantial shortage within the accounts was going
to emerge. I then made arrangements to attend the office with Rob Fitzgerald,
Investigation Manager.

On arrival to the Post Office, I introduced myself and Rob Fitzgerald to the
Subpostmaster, David Yates, and informed him of the reason for our presence. I also
explained that prior to determining a course of action, I needed to speak with the Audit
Manager, Paul Bosson, in order to receive an appraisal of events thus far. Mr Yates
agreed that a rest room within the premises could be used to this effect.

Paul Bosson informed me that he had received a telephone call the previous day,
Thursday 6" March 2003, from Michael Dadra, Operations Manager within the Security &
Audit Team. The details of this call concerned discrepancies in post audit checks, relating
to Walton on Thames Post Office and an audit conducted on 15" November 2002. In
summary, part of the audit process involves the recording of remittances that have been
despatched from Post Offices. At some stage after an audit, checks are made against
figures that Subpostmasters claim to have been remitted out from their office, against
figures recorded as being remitted in by Cash Centres. It had been identified that the
alleged remittances on the audit of 15" November 2002 had not been declared as
received by the Cash Centre, or indeed recorded on the cash account submitted by
Walton on Thames Post Office. In effect, there was a discrepancy in the amounts sent
and the amounts received totalling £330,000.00.

Due to this discrepancy, Mr Bosson, accompanied by Sue Le May, Auditor, had attended
Walton on Thames Post Office on Friday 7" March 2003.

On commencement of the audit, Mr Bosson asked Mr Yates for a balance snapshot. This
document, obtained from the Horizon computer system, indicates the levels of cash and
stock that should be on hand. The snapshot was produced and a part copy is enclosed.
It can be seen that the cash figure is recorded as being £410,354.67.

Mr Bosson then asked Mr Yates to provide the office cash declaration from the previous
day, Thursday 6" March 2003. A cash declaration should be completed by outlets on a
daily basis, at the close of business, ensuring that the amount of actual cash on hand is
recorded. This document was located and provided to Mr Bosson. A copy is enclosed. It
can be seen that the total cash figure is recorded as being £43,566.00.

Clearly, there was a difference in the amount of cash that should have been on hand
(snapshot) and the amount of cash actually on hand (declaration). Accordingly, Mr Yates
informed Mr Bosson that a remittance had been despatched the previous day, Thursday
6" March 2003, but it had not been entered onto the Horizon system. This would have

In order to verify what Mr Yates had said, Mr Bosson then requested the Cash In Transit

from the CIT officer who collects the remittance. On examination of the book, Mr Bosson
pointed out that the last entry concerned a remittance on Wednesday 5" March, not
Thursday 6" March. A copy of the last entry is enclosed.

For further verification, Mr Bosson asked Mr Yates for the P884 forms (subsequently
determined as being P5257MA forms). These forms are used by Subpostmasters to
detail a breakdown of all cash being remitted. The top copy of the forms are enclosed in
the relevant pouches and the undercopy of the forms are retained in the Post Office, for
audit purposes. It should also be noted that the maximum amount of cash, which can be
placed in a pouch, is £20,000.00 and a P5257MA should be completed for each pouch.
Accordingly, there should have been a number of P5257MA undercopies to reflect the
alleged remittance of the previous day.

Mr Yates claimed he could not find the forms. At this stage Mr Yates also informed Mr
Bosson that no remittance had been despatched the previous day and that the audit
would probably result in a shortage of some £350,000.00.

A report detailing the events so far was written by Mr Bosson and he and Mr Yates signed
the report. A copy of the report is enclosed. The matter was then referred to the
Investigation Team.

I then spoke to Mr Yates, inviting him to attend a tape-recorded interview and explaining
his legal rights and his right to have a friend present during the interview. I also cautioned
Mr Yates and he agreed to be interviewed.

At 12.10 hours I commenced a tape-recorded interview with Mr Yates. Also present was
Rob Fitzgerald. Mr Yates declined the right to seek legal representation or advice, or the
offer of a friend to be present during the interview.

The interview consisted of one tape (seal ref 046861) and was concluded at 12.54 hours.
A taped summary has been prepared and is associated.

Mr Yates admitted to inflating his cash figures for the past 3 to 5 years in order to conceal
an ever-increasing shortage. Given the length of time of this activity, he could not recall,
specifically, when this falsification of his accounts commenced or the amounts,
specifically, that had accrued over the period. He was aware that when completing the
last cash account, on Wednesday 5" March, he inflated the cash by £350,000.00.

amount had ‘mushroomed’, culminating in a deficiency of £350,000.00.

Mr Yates claimed no one else was aware of what he was doing and that he had
completed the accounts each and every week over the past few years. He also admitted
to falsely claiming outward remittances at two previous audits (now known to have been
15" November 2002 and 23 May 2002).

A number of cash accounts were shown to Mr Yates during interview. Two of these
related to weeks 9, ending 29" May 2002, and 10, ending 5" June 2002. The signatures
on these accounts appeared to be different and Mr Yates claimed that his colleague,
Lindsey Smale, had signed the account for week 10. He further claimed that he trained
her on how to prepare the accounts and whilst she hadn't physically completed the
account, she had signed it.

Following the interview, I spoke with you and you indicated that Mrs Smale was making
her way to Walton on Thames Post Office. You informed me that Mrs Smale might be
considered with regards to running the outlet on a temporary basis, until the final outcome
of the investigation had been determined. You also informed me that Mrs Smale had
claimed to have completed the cash accounts in May/June 2002, when Mr Yates took a
vacation in the United States.

This obviously implicated Mrs Smale in the investigation, as Mr Yates claimed to have
falsified his accounts for the past 3 to 5 years and it therefore required an explanation as
to how a balance was achieved during these 2 weeks. It was decided that Mrs Smale
would be invited to attend an interview on her arrival to the office.

In the meantime, a search of the Post office was instigated. Mr Yates provided consent
for the search and a quantity of documents were seized. The search commenced at
14.00 hours and concluded at 15.15 hours. Paul Dawkins, Investigation Team Manager,
had also arrived by this stage.

Mrs Smale arrived and following introductions and the reason for our visit, I invited her to
attend a tape-recorded interview. I explained her legal rights and right to have a friend
present during the interview. Mrs Smale agreed to be interviewed.

At 15.38 hours I commenced a tape -recorded interview with Mrs Smale. Also present was
Rob Fitzgerald. Mrs Smale declined the right to seek legal representation or advice, or the
offer of a friend to be present during the interview.

The interview consisted of one tape (seal ref 046862) and was concluded at 16.00 hours.
A taped summary has been prepared and is associated.

On examination of the cash accounts for weeks 9 and 10, and in particular the signatures
on them, Mrs Smale agreed that they reflected Mr Yates period of absence and that she
had completed and signed them. She further claimed that Mr Yates informed her that
there was £250,000.00 within the safe, relating to a closed Post Office that was being held
by Walton on Thames Post Office. This figure was incorporated into the cash account for
both weeks, in addition to the other cash physically on hand. Mrs Smale stated she did
not have any concerns over this as she had known and worked with Mr Yates for many
years and she took what he had said to be true.

Following the interview of Mrs Smale, arrangements were made to attend the home
address of Mr Yates, in order for a search to be carried out. Mr Yates provided consent for
the search and a further quantity of documents were seized. The search commenced at
17.30 hours and concluded at 18.30 hours.

One item seized was the passport of Mr Yates. There is an immigration stamp indicating
that Mr Yates was in the United States from 25" May 2002. It was pointed out that during
interview, Mr Yates claimed he had not been away. Mr Yates stated he wasn't really
thinking straight. A part copy of the passport is enclosed.

Since the interview, I have examined all documentation in this case. Further
documentation has been identified as relating to the two audits in 2002.

Audit 23 May 2002 - Within the cash account file, was a quantity of P5257MA forms,
datestamped 23 May 2002. There are 15 such forms and the amounts on them total
£285,000.00. Copies of these and part of the relevant cash account for week 9, ending
29" May 2002, are enclosed. There is no outward remittance for the amounts on the
P5257MA's. A copy of the diary entry of 24"" May 2002 (item seized) is also enclosed,
annotated ‘David off 2 weeks USA until 12 June’.

Audit 15" November 2002 - On examination of the CIT book, there are 2 pages
datestamped 15" November 2002, detailing 16 pouches for collection. Copies of these
and a further page datestamped 13" November 2002, and the cash account for week 34,
ending 20" November 2002, are enclosed. It can be seen that the signatures on the CIT
book appear to be in the name of Peter Rodriguez, though the signatures are different.
There is no outward remittance for the pouches indicated.

In addition, you found Horizon printouts, whilst subsequently clearing the office with Mrs
Smale. These printouts detail a remittance of 15" November 2002, totalling £330,000.00,
and the subsequent reversal of this remittance on 20" November 2002. A copy of the
printouts are enclosed.

The final audit result was a shortage of £359,325.71. A report and breakdown of this
figure has been prepared by Mr Bosson, Audit Manager, and a copy is enclosed.

In respect of Mr Yates reasons for falsifying his accounts, it should be noted that due to
shortages being covered up, by the inflation of his cash, a true picture of actual shortages
accrued will be impossible to determine. In respect of error notices, 2 schedules are
enclosed. The first details all error notices since January 2000. The amount of charges is
indicated as £9,089.23 and the amount of claims is indicated as £12,293.73, thus implying
that Mr Yates has actually gained financially from the error notices. The second schedule,
Holding Account Analysis Report, details error notices since 1997, which, for various
reasons, have been written off by Post Office Ltd.

reflect cash accounts referred to during interview, the first account within the cash account
file obtained (week 30, ending 20" October 1999), other cash accounts over the past few
years and the last cash account produced by Mr Yates (week 49, ending 5" March 2003).

I am employed by Post Office Ltd as a Contracts Manager. I have worked for Post
Office Ltd for 20 years, of which the last eighteen months has been as Contracts
Manager. My responsibilities include the consistent deployment of all agency policies
and procedures relating to the contract for services of Subpostmasters, within a
defined geographical area. Furthermore, I advise Retail Line Managers and other
appropriate sections and business units, of the various conditions of the
Subpostmasters contract.

Subpostmasters are not employees of Post Office Ltd, but operate under a contract to
provide services on behalf of Post Office Ltd. Subpostmasters usually locate the actual
Post Office in premises in which they also run a private business. Under the terms of
the contract, Subpostmasters have sole responsibility for all stock and cash, and for all

daily and weekly accounting and administration in respect of the Post Office.

From records held I can state that Mr David Yates was the Subpostmaster at Walton on
Thames Post Office, from 13" September 1993 to 7" March 2003, when his contract
for services was suspended.

I am employed by Post Office Ltd and have been since 1986. My job title is Investigation Manager and my
responsibilities are to lead and assist investigations into suspected criminal offences committed against
the business by its employees, agents and staff.

On Friday 7" March 2003, I was informed that an audit of the accounts was being conducted at Walton on
Thames Post Office, 73 Hersham Road, Walton on Thames, Surrey, KT12 1LN, and that there were
indications a substantial deficiency of cash would emerge. I made arrangements to attend the Post
Office, with my colleague, Rob Fitzgerald.

On arrival at the office, I introduced myself and Rob Fitzgerald to the Subpostmaster, Mr David Yates, and
explained that the reason for our presence was in connection with the audit being carried out. I informed
Mr Yates that I wished to speak with the Audit Manager, Mr Paul Bosson, prior to determining a course of

action.

Following my conversation with Paul Bosson, I cautioned Mr Yates and invited him to attend a tape
recorded interview. I also explained his legal rights and his right to have a friend present during the
interview. Mr Yates agreed to be interviewed.

At 1210 hours I commenced a tape recorded interview with Mr Yates, within an office at Walton on
Thames Post Office. Also present was Rob Fitzgerald, Investigation Manager. The interview consisted of
one tape. I now produce form CS001, relating to Mr Yates’ legal rights as itemDP/1. I also produce the
master tape for this interview (bearing seal number 046861) as itemDP/2 and the taped summary of this

Continuation of statement of Dave Posnett

Following this interview, a search of the Post Office secure area was conducted. The search was
undertaken by Rob Fitzgerald and Paul Dawkins, Investigation Team Manager, who had subsequently
arrived at the office. The search commenced at 1400 hours and was completed at 1515 hours. All items

seized during the search were recorded on form CS005, which I now produce as itemDP/4.

Mr Yates also agreed to a search of his home address of,

GRO

and Paul Dawkins. The search commenced at 1730 hours and was completed at 180 hours. All items

seized during the search were recorded on form CS005, which I now produce as itemDP/5.

Most transactions performed by a Post Office are checked at some stage thereafter and there are
occasions when errors are identified. An example of such an error could be if a customer deposits £100
into a personal Girobank account, but the Subpostmaster enters the transaction on the Horizon system as
£10. When Girobank receive the customers deposit slip, they will reconcile the transaction with details
supplied by the Post Office. They will note that the Post Office has made an error and an ‘error notice’ will
be generated. The ‘charge’ error notice is despatched to the Post Office where the transaction occurred
and the Subpostmaster is required to financially make good the error and record this within the accounts.
Errors work both ways and ‘claim’ error notices are also issued to Post Offices, whereby a Subpostmaster
is permitted to withdraw cash that is proper to him. Records of error notices relating to all Post Offices are
maintained at the Post Office Ltd, Accounts Division, Chesterfield.

Due to my position as Investigation Manager, I have access to records relating to the business of Post
Office Ltd. As part of further enquiries, I obtained a record of error notices in relation to Walton on
Thames Post Office. These records consist of two schedules. The first schedule details error notices
covering the period January 2000 to December 2002. I now produce this schedule as itemDP/6. The
second schedule details error notices covering the period 1997 to 2001. I now produce this schedule as
item DP/7.

Post Office accounting weeks run from Thursday to Wednesday and are referred to as Cash Account
Periods (CAP’s). After the close of business on Wednesdays, a balance of all cash, stock and
transactions is conducted, which culminates in a cash account being produced from the Horizon computer
system. This is the official accounting document produced each CAP and one cash account is
despatched to Chesterfield and another is retained within the Post Office.

Continuation of statement of Dave Posnett

Whilst at Walton on Thames Post Office I obtained the cash accounts. On further examination of these
documents, I can say that that they reflect the period from October 1999 through to March 2003, though a
number of CAP’s appear to be missing. I now produce these cash accounts as itemDP/8.

Most of the cash accounts are contained within a folder and whilst examining this folder, I noticed a

quantity of P5257MA forms. These are remittance advice notes, completed in duplicate, and

Subpostmasters are required to complete these forms when they rem out cash from their Post Office.

The advice notes should be placed into a secure pouch with the cash they relate to, prior to collection from
the Cash In Transit team. I know from experience that the maximum amount of cash that can be placed
into a secure pouch is £20,000.00 and an advice note should be prepared for each pouch being remmed.

There were 15 advice notes, datestamped 23° May 2002, relating to CAP 09 and totalling £285,000.00. I
now produce these advice notes as itemDP/9.

I am aware that an audit of the accounts was completed at Walton on Thames Post Office on 28 May
2002 (exhibit MD/1 refers). On examination of the cash account relating to this date (CAP 09), specifically
the ‘Table 9 Rems To ADC’, at page 5, a cash amount of £40,000.00 is recorded at being remmed out,
not £285,000.00.

I am also aware that an audit of the accounts was completed at Walton on Thames Post Offie on 15”
November 2002 (exhibit MD/2 refers). On examination of the Cash In Transit collections book (exhibit
PB/3) for the 15" November 2002, there are 16 pouches indicated as being remmed out from the Post
Office, detailed on 2 pages. The signatures on these pages appear to be in the name of ‘Peter
Rodrigues’. A further remittance on 13” November 2002, detailing 2 pouches remmed out, also appears
to contain a signature in the name of ‘Peter Rodrigues’, but this signature is different from the signaures
of 15" November 2002. On examination of the cash account relating to this date (CAP 34), specifically
the ‘Table 9 Rems To ADC’, at page 5, a cash amount of £20,000.00 is recorded as being remmed out.

Certain records to which I refer in this statement form part of the records relating to the business of Post

I am employed by Post Office Ltd as a Retail Line Manager and have been so for the past 5 years. My
role involves the supervision of a number of post office outlets within a defined geographical area,
ensuring that business objectives are met in the area of sales, accuracy, mystery shopper etc.

One office I am responsible for is Walton on Thames Post Office, 73 Hersham Road, Walton on Thames,
Surrey, KT12 1LN. On Friday 7? February 2003, I suspended and subsequently terminated the contract
for services of the Subpostmaster, Mr David Yates.

On Monday 10" February 2003 I attended Walton on Thames Post Office in order to tidy up the office and
clear out rubbish in preparation for the appointment of a temporary Subpostmaster. Whilst atthe office, I
found three Horizon printouts relating to cash remitted out. I contacted Dave Posnett, Investigation
Manager, who requested that I send the printouts to him.

The first printout details an outward cash remittance of £330,000.00, dated 15/11/02, at 09:01 hours. This
printout is produced from the Horizon computer system when details of an outward remittance are entered

on the system. I now produce this printout as itemEW/1.

The second printout details the reversal of an outward remittanceof £205,000.00, dated 20/11/02, at
07:23 hours. The facility exists on the Horizon computer system to reverse certain transactions that have
previously been entered. This facility can be used, for example, if a customer returns and wishes to
cancel a transaction previously conducted, or if a Subpostmaster books in stock incorrectly which is later

noticed and the correct amount can be booked in. I now produce this printout as itemEW/2.

I am a Network Audit Manager, employed by Post Office Ltd, and I have been so for approximately 16
years. My duties include the verification of cash and stock by undertaking audits at all Post Office Ltd
outlets. I can confirm that on Friday 7 March 2003, myself and Sue Le May (Network Auditor) arrived at
Walton on Thames Post Office, Hersham Road, Walton on Thames, Surrey, KT12 1LN, in order to
conduct an audit of the accounts. This audit was instigated by Michael Dadra, Security And Audit
Operations Manager, following discrepancies identified in post-audit checks resulting from a previous
audit conducted on 15" November 2002. The audit commenced at approximately 0855 hours.

All Post Office outlets operate with the Horizon computerised accounting system. All transactions,
declarations, balancing processes etc must be performed on the Horizon system.

As part of the audit process, an office snapshot is obtained from the Horizon system. The office snapshot
is a report, which can be printed, and details all the cash, stock and vouchers which should be on hand
and all transactions which have been entered onto the system. A physical check of the cash, stock and
vouchers is then conducted and compared to the office snapshot, in order to verify that all items are

present. The user of the Horizon system has to enter the amount of cash on hand when a balance is

performed (usually Wednesdays) and the Horizon system takes into account all receipts and payments

entered throughout the following week, thus it continually calculates how much cash should physically be
on hand.

I asked the Subpostmaster of Walton on Thames Post Office, Mr David Yates, to produce an office
snapshot from the Horizon computer system. This was done and I nowproduce this report as item PB/1.

Continuation of statement of Paul Bosson

It is also a requirement for Subpostmasters to physically declare the amount of cash they are holding on a
daily basis. This procedure should be performed before the close of business each day. Once the cash
has been declared, a printout of this declaration should be obtained from the Horizon system.

I asked Mr Yates to produce the office cash declaration which should have been obtained the previous

day, Thursday 6” March. This was done and I now produce this repott as item PB/2.

Following an examination of the office snapshot and the office cash declaration, it was evident that the
cash figures differed significantly. The office snapshot, which indicates the amount of cash that should be
on hand, detailed £410,354.67 (four hundred and ten thousand, three hundred and fifty four pounds, sixty
seven pence). The office cash declaration, which indicates how much cash is physically on hand, detailed
£43,566.00 (forty three thousand, five hundred and sixty six pounds).

Mr David Yates then informed me that he had sent a remittance the previous day (Thursday 6" March
2003), but had not booked it out on the Horizon system. A remittance is performed when an office has
excess cash, mutilated cash, obsolete stock etc. Such items are booked out on the Horizon system and
enclosed in secure pouches with remittance advice notes (formerly referenced as P884's, now referenced
as P5257MA’s). The advice notes should be completed by the Subpostmaster in duplicate and they detail
a breakdown of the items being remmed. The top copy is placed within the secure pouch and the

undercopy should be retained and archived at the Post Office.

Any pouches to be remmed should also be recorded in the Cash In Transit (CIT) collections book. Each
pouch has a serial number and these numbers should be recorded in the CIT book and the book should
be datestamped. The CIT book is carbonised, with 5 copies of collection receipts subsequently containing
the details of a remittance. The Subpostmaster arranges for a secure collection of the remittance and

when the CIT officer attends the Post Office, he should sign, time and date the CIT book as an

acknowledgement that the pouches have been taken. Two copies of the CIT book collection receipts are
left with the Subpostmaster, the top copy, which should be retained and archived at the Post Office, and a
further copy, which remains in the CIT book.

I asked Mr Yates to show me the CIT collections book. On examination of the book, I noted that the last
collection was dated Wednesday 8” March 2003 (not Thursday 6" March 2003). I now produce the CIT
collection book as item PB/3.

I made a note of the events thus far and asked Mr Yates to sign this note. I now produce this note as item

PB/4. The matter was then referred to other managers within Post Office Ltd.

The audit of the accounts continued and resulted in a shortage of £359,325.71. The audit accounting
form P32 was completed by myself and I now produce this as itemPB/5. I also submitted a report of the

audit to Dave Posnett, Investigation Manager, which I now produce as itemPB/6.

Paragraph I Post Office comment
in Draft
CRR
1.5(f) Paragraph 1.5(f) of the CRR notes that the Applicant has raised consequential losses

“which may be raised if the case progresses to mediation". As stated in the CRR, it is
outside the scope of the Scheme and Second Sight's role for it to assess or comment on
any consequential losses claimed by an Applicant. However, in the interests of
transparency, Post Office notes that it does not consider the losses claimed by the
Applicant to be recoverable under any circumstances.

The relationship between Subpostmasters and:Post Office is. governed by acontract. Post
Office has considered the circumstances of this case very carefully and on the basis of the
information provided by the Applicant, in its own investigation and.in the CRR, does not
consider that it has in acted in breach of contract omcaused the Applicant the harm now
claimed as consequential loss, not least given the unequivocal admission of theft by the
Applicant.

1.9-1.10 I The Applicant admitted to theft and false accounting during his,interview under caution.
When faced with the charge of theft in criminal proceedings, the Applicant pleaded guilty.
A plea of guilty to a charge entails a complete admission to the offence. Nothing in the
Post Office investigation or the draft CRR presents a challenge to this»position.

The plea was voluntarily entered after the Applicant had the opportunity to take legal
advice. Post Office is not responsible for any advice that the Applicant may or may not
have received. If the Applicant considers thathe was wrongly advised, then that is a
matter to be address withhis lawyer.

4.11 Post Office does not agree that the sum of £41,000 was accepted in full and final
settlement as stated at paragraph .11 of the CRR.

Other than the Applicant's unsubstantiated claims, there is no evidence that the sum of
£41,000 was ever repaid by the Applicant. There is no evidence that Post Office accepted
any sum in full and final settlement of the losses suffered. There is insufficient evidence
available to establish what the result of the civil recovery proceedings were or to what
extent sums remain outstanding to Post Office.

3.3 At no stage during any of the audits carried out at the branch, or in any recorded calls to
NBSC, or in the criminal proceedings did the Applicant claim that Horizon was to blame.

In addition, Horizon was introduced on 11 July 2000, but there is evidence that the
Applicant admitted to the shortfall building up since 1998 which undermines his claim that
the differences started to occur a few weeks after Horizon was introduced.

5.2 The Applicant's false accounting meant that the branch's cash declarations were incorrect
5.10 as more cash was Stated to be in the branch than there actually was.

As a result, it was impossible for Post Office, and will have been very difficult if not
impossible for staff in the branch, to have identified the days on which there was a cash
shortfall and / or the amount of the shortfall.

A consequence of not accurately recording a cash shortfall on any given day was to
deprive the Applicant of the ability to immediately review that days transactions for errors
by branch staff that could have been the cause of the shortfall. Had a review been
undertaken on each day where there was a shortage of cash, it is possible that some
errors could have been identified and remedied at the time as the days trading would have
been fresh in the Applicant's mind.

Put another way, the Applicant's false accounting may have caused potentially remediable

fe,

POLO0066601

accounting and transaction errors in branch to become actual losses.

Despite this, Post Office's position is that in the Applicant's case, the bulk, if not all, of the
losses at the branch were actual losses arising from the Applicant's admitted theft and that
if there were any potentially remediable accounting and transaction errors they would have
been very minor in comparison to the sums stolen.

Bond Dickinson Legal Analysis

Legal analysis of branch losses

Legal factor Legal risk Legal risk
(0% = no risk adjusted
to POL) I claim value

Claim value £59,040

The Applicant seeks repayment of the £41,000 he claims to have paid
Post Office plus interest of £18,040.

Consequential Losses are also claimed by the Applicant which are dealt
with separately below.

Has the claim already been barred / determined so that legal 0% £0
proceedings cannot be brought against POL?

Civil recovery proceedings appear to have been pursued by Post Office,
though there is no evidence to confirm what exactly this related to or how
the proceedings were concluded. It would almost certainly be impossible
to revisit the civil recovery proceedings, due to any action now being time
barred and/or considered an abuse of process.

Responsibility for loss. 0% £0

Second Sight appears to accept that the Applicant stole cash from Post
Office and concealed the theft over a 5 year period. Second Sight abo
appears to accept that the available evidence is at odds with the
Applicant's claim that Horizon caused the losses.

Given the Applicant's unequivocal admission of theft, there is no risk of
Post Office being found responsible for the direct losses in this case.

Bond Didingow

Has the claim already been barred / determined so that legal 0% £0
proceedings cannot be brought against POL?

Yes

Is there the possibility of an unlawful termination claim because the 0% £0
Applicant's contract was not terminated on 3 months’ notice?

No — claim would be time barred.

Was contract termination unlawful? 0% £0

No evidence to suggest that Post Office committed any breach of contract
in terminating the Applicant's contract.

Is there evidence that the Applicant could have "sold" his / her 0% £0
branch as a going concern if given 3 months' notice?

No

Suitability for mediation

This case is not suitable for mediation as the Applicant admitted to theft, the case is 11 years old and
there is no evidence whatsoever to substantiate any of the Applicant's claims. Second Sight appears to
agree unequivocally with this view.

Additional Notes

Recoverability of consequential losses:

. Mileage Claim (inc interest): £1,778.11 — Potentially recoverable if Applicant successful in
overturning conviction

. Lost wages (inc interest): £870,814.65 — Only 3 months lost wages would be recoverable — max
£19,594.50 and does not take into account costs of running the business.

. Lost profits (inc interest): £80,520 - Only 3 months recoverable — max £1,500 (based on net
profits of £6,000 per year.

. Loss of goodwill: £100,000 - Irrecoverable at law

. Legal costs: £2,500 — Potentially recoverable if Applicant successful in overturning conviction.

. Future wages: £171,631 — Irrecoverable at law

Total losses potentially recoverable: £25,372.61

Advice qualifications

1. This advice has been produced by applying the principles set out in the Advice from Linklaters dated
20 March 2014.

2. No further legal analysis of the underlying legal principles has been carried out, in particular we
have not considered any other possible legal bases for the Applicant's claims including without
limitation malicious prosecution, defamation, malicious falsehood, breach of confidence, tortious
causes of action or privacy law.

3. We have not analysed the possibility that failures by Post Office in training or supporting the
Applicant, or subsequently investigating losses, may have contributed to the Applicant's ability to
prevent losses in branch.

4. Our advice is based on only the information in the Applicant's Case Questionnaire Response, the
Post Office Investigation Report and Second Sight's Case Review Reports. Our advice does not
factor in the possibility of further information being available at a later date that may change our
analysis.

5. We have not considered the Applicant's appetite or capacity to bring proceedings against POL or
any of the "other" factors set out in the settlement mandate.

6. We have applied a de minis threshold to legal risk. Where the legal risk is very small (less than
20%) we have recorded this as 0% in our analysis.

Risk of future litigation / court costs

Applicant's only option at this stage would be to seek to overturn the
criminal conviction on the basis of new evidence that was not available at
the time of the criminal trial. There is a risk he may attempt to do this,
but, the risk of the Applicant being able to get an appeal on foot is de

Dear Sirs
Post Office’s Response to Second Sight’s draft Case Review Report on case M071

This letter sets out Post Office’s response to Second Sight's draft Case Review Report dated 30 October
2014 for application M071 (the CRR).

The appendix to this letter has Post Office's line-by-line comments on the CRR.

In summary, given the Applicant's admission of guilt and conviction for theft, together with the fact that
the available evidence is completely at odds with theApplicant’s claims, Post Office agrees with the
CRR's conclusion that this case should not be mediated under any,circumstances:

If you have any questions about this response, please do not hesitate to.contact me.

Yours faithfully

Appendix
Line by line comments
Paragraph I Post Office comment
in Draft
CRR
1.5(f) Paragraph 1.5(f) of the CRR notes that the Applicant has raised consequential losses

“which may be raised if the case progresses to mediation". As stated in the CRR, it is
outside the scope of the Scheme and Second Sight's role for it to assess or comment on
any consequential losses claimed by an Applicant. However, in the interests of
transparency, Post Office notes that it does not consider the losses claimed by the
Applicant to be recoverable under any circumstances.

The relationship between Subpostmasters and,Post Office is. governed by acontract. Post
Office has considered the circumstances of this case very carefully and on the basis of the
information provided by the Applicant, in its own investigation and.in the CRR, does not
consider that it has in acted in breach of contract ofcaused the Applicant the harm now
claimed as consequential loss, not least given the unequivocal admission of theft by the
Applicant.

1.9-1.10 I The Applicant admitted to theft and false accounting during his,cautionary interview. When
faced with the charge of theft in criminal/proceedings, the Applicant pleaded guilty. A plea
of guilty to a charge entails a complete admission tothe offence. Nothing in the Post
Office investigation or the draft CRR presents a challenge to this position.

The plea was voluntarily entered after the Applicant had the opportunity to take legal
advice. Post Office is not responsible for any advice that the Applicant may or may not
have received. If the Applicant considers thathe was wrongly advised, then that is a
matter to be address withhis lawyer.

4.11 Post Office does not agree that the sum of £41,000 was accepted in full and final
settlement as stated at paragraph .11 of the CRR.

Other than the Applicant's unsubstantiated claims, there is no evidence that the sum of
£41,000 was ever repaid by the Applicant. There is no evidence that Post Office accepted
any sum in full and final settlement of the losses suffered. There is insufficient evidence
available to establish what the result of the civil recovery proceedings were or to what
extent sums remain outstanding to Post Office.

3.3 At no stage during any of the audits carried out at the branch, or in any recorded calls to
NBSC, or in the criminal proceedings did the Applicant claim that Horizon was to blame.

In addition, Horizon was introduced on 11 July 2000, but there is evidence that the
Applicant admitted to the shortfall building up since 1998 which undermines his claim that
the differences started to occur a few weeks after Horizon was introduced.

5.2 The Applicant's false accounting meant that the branch's cash declarations were incorrect
5.10 as more cash was Stated to be in the branch than there actually was.

As a result, it was impossible for Post Office, and will have been very difficult if not
impossible for staff in the branch, to have identified the days on which there was a cash
shortfall and / or the amount of the shortfall.

A consequence of not accurately recording a cash shortfall on any given day was to
deprive the Applicant of the ability to immediately review that day's transactions for errors
by branch staff that could have been the cause of the shortfall. Had a review been
undertaken on each day where there was a shortage of cash, it is possible that some
errors could have been identified and remedied at the time as the days trading would have
been fresh in the Applicants mind.

Put another way, the Applicant's false accounting may have caused potentially remediable

Despite this, Post Office's position is that in the Applicant's case, the bulk, if not all, of the
losses at the branch were actual losses arising from the Applicant's admitted theft and that
if there were any potentially remediable accounting and transaction errors they would have
been very minor in comparison to the sums stolen.

rights. Now because you are suspected of having committed a criminal offence
which may result in 2 criminal prosecution, I must inform you that you do not
have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when
I questioned hing which you later rely on in court. Anything yeu do sey may

be given in evidence. Do you understand.

DY Yes.

DP In order to check your understanding of that caution could you just explain it to
me.

DY Anything that I say can be used in court basically and if I don’t say anything it
could be used against me.

213 DP That's certainly an element of it. What I'll do is just break it down to make sure
you're absolutely satisfied with it. I'm an Investigator employed by Post Office
LTD to investigate possibie criminal offences. You are suspected of committing
a criminal offence. Do you understand that.

DY Yeah.

OP I wish to put questions to you about this criminal offence and record your
answers to those questions. Do you understand that.

DY Yeah, that's fine.

DP Firstly, a person who is being interviewed for a suspected criminal offence does
not have to say anything. You do not have to answer my questions. Do you
understand that.

DY Yes I understand that.

DP Secondly, if you say nothing now but in court give an explanation which could be
given now, then the court may think that the explanation is untrue or you have
made it up. You understand that bit.

DY Yeah.

DP And thirdly anything you say during the interview is being recorded on tape and

can be read out in court.

309 DP Right back to this form CS001, there's 4 points at the top of the form. I'll go

through these with you. 1 you are not under arrest. 2 you do not have to
remain at this interview.

Mr Yates confirms he consents to be interviewed at Walton on Thames Post
office.

DP 3 If you do remain you have the right to seek legal representation and advice,
including the right to speak with a solicitor either in person or on the telephone.
The solicitor will give you advice regarding legal aid and I can help you obtain a
solicitor. 4 you are entitled to read the Police & Criminal Evidence 1984 Act
codes of practice if you wish. I've got the booklet here and those codes
basically set out your legal rights and the rules governing the conduct of this

interview.
DY Okay, fine, yeah I understand.
DP Now there are a few questions underneath that, if I can just get you to answer

those in your own handwriting.
Mr Yates completes form CS001.

449 DP If you sign it, it's now 12.16. Right I'll just go through these questions you've
answered. Have you read 1 to 4 above, you've indicated yes. Do you
understand 4 to 4 above, you've indicated yes. With regards to speaking to a
solicitor you've signed to say you do not wish to speak to a solicitor at this time.
But in relation to the question 'if you do not wish to speak to a solicitor at this
time you can change you mind at any time during the interview, do you
understand’, you've indicated yes.

friend present.

Okay, what I'll do first is go through @ report that the audit manager, Paul
Bosson has written. I'll read it out on tape and it starts’ I attended Walton on
Thames Post Office on Friday 7" March 2003 to conduct an audit. The audit
commenced at approximately 0855. At the start of the audit I asked the
Subpostmaster, David Yates, to produce an office snapshot, which indicated an
office cash holding of £410,354.67. I asked David to produce the office cash
declaration completed at 16.40 the day previous, which showed at total of
£43,566.00. David told me he had sent a rem the previous day out had not
booked it out on the Horizon system. I asked him to show me the CIT (Cash In
Transit) collection receipt, but this indicated that the last collection was
Wednesday 5" March 2003. I asked David if he could produce the rem out form
P884 but he could not find it. At this point David admitted to me that he had not
sent a rem and that we would find a shortage in the account of around
£350,000.00. I confirm that this is a true account of the events and conversation
that took place between myself, Paul Bosson, and the Subpostmaster, David
Yates’.

Yeah.

And Paul Bosson’s signed it I believe.

And so have I.

And you've signed it. Do you agree with the content of that note.
Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

Right, so why is there going to be a shortage of £350,000.00.

Well I've been carrying it for ... I don’t know...years basically. I don't know how
to explain really.

Well let's

that actually mean.

DY Carrying like a shortage for like ... I don’t know ... at least 3 years.

DP 3 years.

DY Yeah, maybe even more, I can't remember exactly when I started getting into
trouble.

DP So how much was the shortage at that stage.

DY What 3 years ago. I don't know it may have been 250, something like that
maybe.

DP £250.

DY No £250,000.00. It must have started miles before then. It started off that we
kept having shortages, we couldn't afford to put them in ... or I kept having
shortages I should say. So I was just carrying it and carrying it and it just builds
up.

OP Just to recap, at least 3 years ago ...

DY Yeah, I mean, probably, maybe ... 5 years ago you know, it’s been a long time.

DP You said you'd suffered shortages, what's the correct procedure for shortages.

DY Obviously to show it and correct it, put it in or take it out depending on whether
it's over or short.

DP Right so to correct a shortage you put it in, by that you mean you have to pay for
any shortages in your accounts.

DY Yeah.

DP Okay. You said you couldn't afford it.

DY No. I was just carrying it as a figure, basically carrying tne cash as if it was

POL00066601

there. So inflating the cash figure I suppose so the shortage didn’t show.

DP You inflated the cash figure on your cash accounts at the end of each
accounting week.

DY Yeah.

4051 DP And this is over the last 3 to 5 years but you can’t be specific. Okay. That's an

awful lot of money Dave.

DY Yeah .., I Know ... I Know itis ... a hell of a lot.

OP So are you saying that over the last 5 years £350,000.00 relates to shortages in -
your accounts.

DY No it’s not shortages. I have taken ...so I don’t know.

OP What do you mean you've taken.

DY Taken to pay staff or ... you know the business wasn't doing as well as it should
be.

DP So an element of this is shortages, some of it is taking the money to pay staff...

DY To pay staff, to pay bills yeah.

DP And that all amounts to £350,000.00

DY I don’t know, I haven't carried a breakdown of it but yes some of it I would have
had, but nowhere near that amount. I mean some of it was ... a couple of times
they phoned up saying we've done rems wrong, that we'd sent them too much
to what we'd claimed, but I didn’t know and they wouldn't tell me how much. I
had to let it go and I just got deeper end deeper into the mire.

DP So you just mentioned @ rem there, didn't you get an error notice for things like

that.

DY No because I don’t know whether they weren't sure it was my bag, they just said
there’s a problem with this rem, can you tell me whether yours was right. Of
course I didn’t know.

1233 DP So this shortage; which has yet to be determined because the audit is still
carrying on, but we guesstimate it’s going to be in excess of £350,000.00. Asa
result of shortages, money you've taken for staff wages, and bills I think you
said. Error notices or other errors.

DY Yeah it would have been yeah, I mean basically everything.

DP Has the money been used for anything else.

DY No, not really, no. I mean I've taken some of it. I had to pay bills of my own.
You know I haven't bought expensive cars or anything like that with it, or second
houses.

Mr Yates restates he has taken some of the money in order to pay bills.

RF How did it all start.

DY I find it difficult to remember. It first started when we had some really large error
notices come back but I just couldn't explain, we had Savings Bank ones that
came back and they were like 5 and 6 thousand pounds. And I just couldn't
understand why they were wrong. I queried it but they said it was definitely right
and I could not afford to pay it and it just seemed to then slowly mount up.

RF If you have an error notice, forgive me if !'m wrong, by generating an error notice
for 6 or 7 thousand pounds, your office should actually be over.

DY Well this is it, it should have been over but it wasn't.

RF Right, and did you ever bring those error notices to the attention of anyone other
than Savings Bank.

DY No. no, I just ¢ it with them as to why it was wrong. I mean! cant

on hand is declared as £201,000.00. Mr Yates cannot explain why the amount
has dropped within the space of a week, claiming he cannot remember, but that
the £201,000.00 would in all probability be correct.

2752 DP Right we are going to plough through these cash accounts, are we going to see
an occasion where cash varies by a significant amount or is it going to be a
gradual process as you've described.

DY It should be gradual.

DP Should be or will it be.

, DY As far as I can remember it will be.

RF Have you ever taken a lump sum out to pay this or that.

DY Yeah I mean I suppose I’ve taken sort of the odd 1 or 2 thousand to pay the staff
wages and things.

RF Do you do that on a weekly or monthly basis.

DY I don’t know, every 2 months maybe, every month maybe sometimes,
depending on how bad !'d got into a position, we weren't making enough to
meet our cosis.

RF What's your salary.

DY Post Office salary about 70 I think.

RF And have you got a shop as well.

DY Yeah

RF How much do you get off that.

DY About 40 roughly now, obviously it wasn’t as much as that then because it's

slowly built uo. The shoo originally was eocut 20. it’s slowly gone up.

2922 DP So why haven't you mentioned these problems to anyone. .

DY I wish I knew, wish I had. I just knew I was in a deep hole and didn't know
where to turn to really. I knew I should go and see somebody but just didn't
know what to do.

DP Now you had an audit I believe at the office in November 2002. What happened
on that audit.

DY I probably told them there was a rem to go out or going out which would have
made up the shortfall.

OP Now is that not pretty much the story you told Paul Bosson this morning.

DY Yeah.

DP So what's the difference, why wasn't it picked up at the last audit.

DY I don’t know.

DP But you agree you were inflating the cash at that audit.

DY Yeah it should have been picked up.

DP And the audit prior to that.

DY Again it would have been, though I don’t know when that was.

Mr Posnett recaps on the report written by Paul Bosson and Mr Yates confirms
the content of the report. He indicates that it wasn’t a case of he couldn't find
the P884 forms, it was the case that he didn’t have them to find.

3107 DP Now you've been Subpostmaster for 9 years and I happen to know you worked
at this office before it was converted from a Branch Office. How long in total
have you been working here.

Should be yeah. Yeah I would say so.

You said you had dug a hole, you were in a hole, where did you see that hole
finishing.

I didn’t, I didn’t know what I was going to do.

What was the ultimate end to this then.

I don't know.

Obviously the ultimate end now is the audit team arriving today ...
Absolutely yeah, I thought that would happen eventually.

From your point of view, you've aiready said this money belonged to the Post
Office. Were you ever in any position to pay any of the money back.

I could never see how! could ever pay it. I mean obviously some maybe, but
never be able to pay it all back.

Did you ever make any attempt to try and pay the money back.

Yes but... not ... no, not really, not a major amount no. I just didn’t know what I

was going to do, I realiy didn’t know what I was going to do..

Mr Yates expiains there are 4 staff in the Post Office with a salary bill of about
£52,000.00 plus the shop people. He reiterates that the money has been used

to carry on living, that the matter wasn't referred to the area manager anc that

though he believed there was a period of 3 years without an audit.
3424 RF So if you hadn’t had an audit today and we didn’t have an audit say for another 3
years, what do you reckon the figure would have been at that stage.
DY I don’t know, I really don't know.
RF So you were never ever going to bring it to anyone's attention, you'd have just
carried on.
DY I don't know, no, as far as I know I probably wouldn't have done. I would have

probably hoped some miracle would have happened that I would have been able
in some way to pay it back ‘somewhere along the line.

DP So you're not in a position to pay it back and based on what you've said, you had
no intention to pay it back, subject to a miracle.

DY No, yeah, I would have liked to have paid it back because I knew it was wrong but
.. My ability to pay it back, you know, I probably couldn't.

DP Okay in week 36, ending 4" December 2002, there were £23,478.95 of Green
Giros that were transacted at this office but didn't arrive in the pouch to Girobank.

DY Well, I don’t know.

DP You don’t know anything about that.

DY No, definitely. I mean I definitely send those every week.

DP Could they be in the office somewhere.

DY Not unless someone has put them somewhere strange. I don’t know. No,

because I usually put them in the pouches every week. And they haven't turned
up at all.

that may be implicated in the main reason that we are here today.

DY Yeah of course, yeah.

DP Obviously we need your consent for a search.

DY Yeah of course that's fine.

BP Now additionally we are also considering attending your home address and
conducting a search there, again in order for us to do that we need your consent.

DY Yeah, okay, yeah ...

DP Well that’s recorded on tape, there’s.a number of forms we'll need to complete
later for that purpose. Also, would you be willing to provide details of your bank
accounts to us.

DY Yeah, I should think so, yeah.

DP Okay, and again there’s forms for that we'll complete a bit later.

RF With regards to both those issues, are we going to find anything on those
searches that are detrimental to you, that you haven't told us.

DY No, not as far as I know, no. No, I mean there shouldn't be.

Mr Yates refers back to the Green Giros, claiming he can’t understand as he
sends them every week.

DY Smale.

the cash account, so I was going through with her how to do it and she probably
just signed it because it was there to be signed. I mean she didn't actually do the
