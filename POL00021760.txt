Rodric
Please see my suggestions attached.

Without wanting to sound derogatory to SPMRs, I've tried to simplify the language in the letter. Please feel free to ignore
my changes if you want a more formal tone.

Parsons, Andrew

All,
Here’s my proposal for the letter. Please let me know if you would like to see it in track change.

DRAFT: private & confidential

Dear [applicant]

Post Office Investigation and Mediation Scheme (the “Scheme”) - Second Sight “Part Two” Report (the
“Report”)

[Enclosed is a copy of OR You should have separately received a copy of] Second Sight’s “Part Two” report.

In the interests of transparency, Post Office wants applicants to be aware of our position on the Report at
the earliest opportunity.

It is important to stress that the Report is not in any way endorsed by Post Office. We have significant
concerns about the factual accuracy of and evidence base for many of the opinions expressed in the
Report, including those made on matters which are beyond the scope of the Scheme and Second Sight’s
professional expertise and qualification.

The overriding aim of Second Sight’s work is to assist applicants, Post Office, and (where relevant) a
mediator, resolve individual applications to the Scheme by providing reasoned, expert opinion which aids
the parties’ understanding of the matters in issue. Regrettably, Post Office does not believe that the Report
promotes that aim, in particular because of its lack of evidence-based findings, and that the “themes”
which the Report attempts to identify are drawn from [[STATS]].

It remains Post Office's priority to make sure that each case in the Scheme is investigated and resolved as
quickly and fairly as possible. Post Office will therefore be setting out for you its detailed position on the
various points raised in the Report, so that you are aware of that position, and the influence that the
Report may have to Post Office’s assessment of your particular case.
