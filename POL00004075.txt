4 MRHENDERSON: My Lord, a couple of housekeeping points 4 a problem.

5 first of all. 1 reviewed my notes for cross-examination 5 MR HENDERSON: Yes of course and I will hand it to the

6 overnight, particularly in the light of your Lordship's 6 witness in due course.

7 final observation of the suggestion that various points 7 MRJUSTICE FRASER: All right, I will just put that to one

8 be put to Mr Patny junior as well and I have taken the 8 side.

9 view that I don’t need to continue my cross-examination 9 On the basis that we're dealing with housekeeping
10 of Mr Patny senior. 10 generally, I was going to deal with this point at the
11 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Understood. 11 end of today but I will deal with it now anda similar
12 MR HENDERSON: So I have notified my learned friend 12 point came up in the common issues trial, or two similar
13 yesterday evening, but apologies for that slight change. 13 points cameup, but I will just explain what they are
14 MRJUSTICE FRASER: No, it is not an apology. So you don't 14 If you're going to be putting -- and youare of course
15 have any re-examination? 15 perfectly entitled to put certain matters which might
16 MRGREEN: Idon't, my Lord. 16 suggest criminal conduct, at an appropriate point the
17 MR JUSTICE FRASER: Let me just check if I have any 17 witness has to have the warning against
18 questions for him. Just give me one second. 18 self-incrimination. If you can just bear that in
19 (Pause). 19 mind -- it doesn’t have to be done at the very beginning
20 There was one minor point but it’s not worth having 20 of their evidence, it can be done at the stage when you
21 him back to ask him. So we're going to start withanew 21 get to that cross-examination, but can you just bear
22 witness today. 22 that in mind so that the warning has to be administered.
23 MRHENDERSON: I'm grateful. And just for your Lordship’s 23  MRHENDERSON: My Lord, yes.

24 information, I think we're on track in terms of 24 MR JUSTICE FRASER: You don’thave to tell_me in advance,
25 timetable 25 but each witness is potentially, if that’s going to be

1 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Don't worry about that. I have been 1 put to them they have to be given that warning That's

2 keeping an eye on that. Right, so Mr Green -- sorry, 2 the first point

3 you had some more housekeeping? 3 ‘The second point is as far as what we have called in

4 MRHENDERSON: No. 4 the common issues trial a hard start in terms of trial

5 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Have you got housekeeping? 5 timetabling, if you find yourself going quicker than you

6 MRGREEN: Only one thing just in case your Lordship wants 6 expected, that is not a problem. I am working on the

7 to see it. MrRoll wanted to clarify more precisely 7 basis that we will be starting with the Post Office

8 some points in his witness statement overnight and in 8 witnesses on Monday morning in terms ofa hard start for

9 accordance with what we did in the common issues trial 9 week 2. I am notin any way going to become intemperate
10 we have incorporated it into his statement so 10 or get upset if for example on Thursday at 11.30 or
ii your Lordship can see how it fits in 11 early afternoon you effectively run out of questions to
12 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Ifyou could hand that up that would be 12 ask the Post Office witnesses and the same applies for
13 excellent. Thankyou. So he is being called on 13 the witness of fact. We're basically doing this trial
14 ‘Thursday. 14 in self-contained weeks.

15 MRGREEN: Heis going to be called this afternoon 15 ‘Then the final point, which is really a point for
16 I understand because we're going to -- I understand 16 Mr Draper: I reviewed the transcript overnight, it

17 we're going to get to him this afternoon. 17 appeared to me that I came across as an exceptionally
18 MRJUSTICE FRASER: All right, fine 18 abrupt in at least two occasions in respect of the way
19 MRHENDERSON: Actually there was one final matter I was 19 you were cross-examining Mr Latif, that was really in
20 going to deal with during cross-examination but perhaps 20 the sense that (a) 1 was aware of the time difference
21 it is more convenient to deal with it now. There is 21 and (b) I was aware of the fact that he was on

22 a further document which is on its way on to finding its 22 a videolink from Pakistan, which is why 1 was probably
23 way to the trial bundle but isn’t there yet. So I have 23 a little more-- or I might have come across a little
24 hard copies again, I have notified my learned friend, 24 more acerbic about how long you were going to be and
25 but could I perhaps hand a copy up just for convenience 25 I don’t want you to read anything into that

MR JUSTICE FRASER: All right?
housekeeping.

MR HENDERSON: My Lord, yes. Dealing with the first point
first which is the relevant warning, Mr Aakash Patny is
coming in this morning and I think out of an abundance
of caution it may simply be sensible to make the warning

So is that all the

wyAnRone

since we are talking abouta lot of declarations
9 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Right, okay. Do you have it with you,
10 Mr Green?
11°) MRGREEN: My Lord, [haven't brought it with me and
12 1 should have done this morning because your Lordship
13 didn’t have the wording yesterday. I apologise
14 MRJUSTICE FRASER: It will be in the White Book.
15  MRGREEN: We can find it on the transcript of the common

16 issues trial which we've got on Opus.
17 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Orit will be in volume 2. So you do
18 Opus, I will do volume 2 and we will see who gets there
19 first
20 (Pause).
21. MRGREEN: My Lord, I’mafraid you are going to beat me
22 because I can’t get back in from this Opus to what
23 1 have in chambers.
24 MRJUSTICE FRASER: I wouldn't give up so quickly, you don't
25 know how longit is going to take me to do it this way.
5
1 Just remind me of the section?
2 MRGREEN: Is it C8.11in - have we got it? My learned
3 junior Mr Miletic has found it in the transcript
4 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Oh, he has found it in the transcript
5 All right, then just call it up because I've got to
6 MRGREEN: So in the documents bundle
7 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Ihave found it, it is 9B, 10.42.
8 “Privilege against incrimination”, section 14. So if
9 you call up what! said last I think
10 (Pause).
11 MRGREEN: My Lord, I've got it at the wording that is
12 shall I just read it out to your Lordship?

13 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Where are you looking?

14 MRGREEN: So this is the warning your Lordship gave

15 Mrs Stockdale

16 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Why can'tit just be called up on the
17 screen?

18 MRGREEN: Itcan be called up on the sereen
19 {C8.11/24/50} and it is on internal page 196 and it
20 begins at line 6.

21 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Or line 7.

22 MRGREEN: Anditis line 10 where your Lordship explains
23 it

24  MRJUSTICE FRASER: Yes. Now, last time I said to the

25 witness what the specific offence was.

So it is

I'mnot sure

that necessarily is required, so instead of specifying
that false accounting was a criminal offence I am going
to be saying what? “Certain facts and matters in
relation to your making of cash declarations”?

MR HENDERSON: Yes, “making declarations of cash and stock’.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: "Making declarations to the Post Office
regarding the cash and stock.”

MR HENDERSON: My Lord, yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Right, well, I will do that at the
beginning.

Is that everything?

MR HENDERSON: Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Yes? Are you about to call another
witness?

MR GREEN: Iam, my Lord.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Right.

MR GREEN: My Lord, lam calling Mr Aakash Patny.

MR AAKASH PATNY (affirmed)

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Thank you very much, Mr Patny. Have
aseat. CanI firstly say that you have been referred
to once or twice as Mr Patny junior, That's not meant

to be patronising or anything like that, it was just to

differentiate you from your father
Secondly, I’m now going to give you a warning which

you have heard debated. I think you might have been in

court yesterday?

AL Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: So you would have heard a similar form
of words to your father. But it is just to tell you,

Mr Henderson is going to ask you some questions and some

of those questions are going to relate to certain facts

and matters relating to the declarations that you made

to the Post Office regarding cash and stock. Under the

Civil Evidence Act 1968 you have the right to refuse to

answer any of his questions if it would tend to expose

you to proceedings for a criminal offence or the

recovery of a penalty. So you might choose to answer
his questions but it is correct that I should warn you
you don’t have to answer any of them if you don’t want
to. If he asks you a question and you want to decline
to answer it, just say "I decline to answer that
question”.

AL Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Thank you very much, Mr Patny. Over to
you, Mr Green.

Examination-in-chief by MR GREEN

MR GREEN: Mr Patny, hopefully there is a bundle in front of
you and if you turn to tab 2 please (E1/2/1}
see there "Amended witness statement of Aakash Patny"?

A. It has Adrees Latif on it.

Is that fairly clear?

You will

7 Q. Doyouhave that? Andis that your signature? 7A. Sometimes, yes.

10 true? 10 I discussed that with your father yesterday as you will
11 A. Yes. 11 recall, but can we look at F/1507.1} and can you enable

12 Q. Thank you very much. Would you wait there. ‘There will 12 editing and remove filtering
13 be some questions. 13 MRJUSTICE FRASER: What document is this?
14 Cross-examination by MR HENDERSON 14 MRHENDERSON: This is the event data think for the
15 MR HENDERSON: Mr Patny, good morning. 15 relevant branch and it shows -- well, can we go to
16 A. Good morning 16 row it is the event data spreadsheet. Can we go to
17 Q. I assume that you were in court yesterday when your 17 row 13904. We looked at this yesterday.
18 father gave evidence, is that right? 18 Mr Patny, it would help me-- when your father was
19 A. Yes. 19 being cross-examined yesterday were you able to see the
20 Q AndI don’t wantto go through everything with you that 20 documents on the screen from somewhere?
21 I said to him, but there are a few points I would like 21 A. No
22 to deal with. 22 Not particularly , okay, fair enough.
23. A. Okay. 23 So this is the day of the outage and this is the
24 Q. In particular I want to deal with various allegations 24 cash declaration that you made at the end of that day at
25 that you make concerning a shortfall, which varies in 25 19.04, Doyousee thar?
9 u
1 amount but which during May 2016 comes and goes, in the 1 AL Yes.
2 value of about £17,000. Do you recall that? 2 And below it we can see that there is a variance for
3 A. Yes 3 minus £1,138.21, do you see that?
4 Q. Andeventually it is right, isn’t it, that a sumof 4A. Yes.
5 around that sum of money was required by the Post Office 5 Q. And that suggests that there is less cash than you were
6 to be settled centrally. Do you recall that? 6 expecting to the tune of that figure?
7 AL Yes 7 AL Yes.
8 Q. Although it hasn't actually been paid to the Post Office 8 So based on that, do you agree that it is very unlikely
9 1 think? 9 that the outage that had occurred during that day was
10 A. No, it hasn't. 10 responsible for the discrepancy of £17,000?
11° Q. And that was towards the end of May or the beginning 11 A. No.
12 of June, something like that? 12 Why not?
13 A. Around that time, yes. 13. A. Well, that's a big amount tobe missing, isn't it,
14 Q. AndasI understand the case put forward by you and your 14 £1,000?
15 father is that this was caused by a bug or bugs in 15 Q. Yes, but it’s not £17,000, that’s my point.
16 Horizon, is that right? 16 A. No, it’s not £17,000, no.
17 A. I believe so, yes. 17 My understanding of your evidence is that you believe
18 Q. Andyour evidence is that the outage on 9 May's the 18 that the outage on 9 May led to the discrepancy of
19 start of the problems, is that right? 19 £17,000 which you discovered on 11 May.
20 A. Yes. 20 A. Yes.
21 Q Okay. And again -- and 1 think this is just covering 21 And what I’m taking you to is the position on 9 May on
22 ‘common ground and you have dealt with it in your 22 the day of the outage itself and pointing out that there
23 statement -- I think you are responsible for the 23 wasn't a discrepancy of £17,000 on that day. Do you
24 declarations in the branch, or you were responsible for 24 accept that?

12 “Doing BP.” 12 cash declarations on, did we not?
13 What's "BP" there? 13 MR HENDERSON: We did. We're coming to that one later,
14 A. Balance period. 14 my Lord. That's a different date.
15 Q. Balance period: 15 So you can’t help me with what happened then, but
16 and got a shortage in cash £17,000. Had a rem 16 your witness statement suggests that you were told to

A. [can’t remember. There were various things that they
made me go over the phone on

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Could you maybe keep your voice up,

Mr Patny.

A. Sorry,

MR JUSTICE FRASER: So whatever steps they told you to do
over the phone, you did them?

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And were they steps to be taken on the
Horizon terminal?

A. It was, yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Right, okay.

MR HENDERSON: But you didn’t make any fresh cash
declaration?

A. I can't remember.

Q. Let's look at the cash management report for your
branch, Again we looked at this yesterday with your
father, so I can hopefully take it reasonably quickly:
In (F/1514.1}- actually just before -- it might be
quicker if I take a further reference in this document
before we leave it, do you mind? Could we go to 15030
in this current document, just to speed things up.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Where are we going now? 15030.

MR HENDERSON: 15030. And this, Mr Patny, is a cash
declaration on 13 May, a further declaration, and you

7

see in 15029, do you see that you declare cash for
a little over £80,000? Do you see that?

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Where?

MR HENDERSON: 15029, “Declare cash total 80,000"?

AL Yes.

Q. And then below that the variance check discrepancy is
plus 17,000-odd, do you see that?

AL Yes.

Q. So that appears to cancel out the previous discrepancy,
doesn't it?

A. It does. Yes.

Q. So just pausing at this point, as far as the branch is
concerned and as far as these records are concerned,
there is no longer a cash problem, is there?

A. Is this saying that it is £17,000 up now, or is it
saying that --

Q. I think that that is saying that whereas before you were
minus 17, you're now on this one plus 17 so you're
cancelling each other out?

‘A. Well, if it was cancelling it would be zero, wouldn't
it?

Q. Well, I think

MR JUSTICE FRASER: You might want to just take instructions
to be absolutely clear

MR HENDERSON: I'm told thatis right, whatI have said.

MR GREEN: Sorry, what?

MR HENDERSON: So my understanding is that the discrepancy
that is shown here has the effect of cancelling out the
previous minus figure, effectively

A. But then that would be zero, wouldn't it, it wouldn't be
17-

Q. Well, the overall net position would be zero, yes.

A. But then that’s what that would show there.

I'm suggesting that it wouldn't, that what this is doing
is taking a later comparison on the information that was
available to it before, which will include the previous
cash declaration, and is saying that compared to that
position it’s £17,000 up?

‘A. But when you are doing the cash dees every day it tells
you a running total of whether you are up or down which
is what you're showing there, so if that in essence
would mean we are now £17,964 up, which is — well, that
means I've found £34,000 all of a sudden from the day
before

Q. Myunderstanding is that’s not the right position. I’m
sure you can keep a running view of it as well, but that
what this line demonstrates is as I have previously
said.

(Pause).
A clearer way of putting the point. You are 17,000

19

down onthe 11th, you roll the branch, that’s the
starting position, this is the result of the latest cash
declaration which is 17,000 up and the net position is

to balance broadly.

A. Okay. But like I said, the previous cash dec was after
7 o'clock so as far as I'm aware before 7 o'clock all
discrepancies or whatever would have been done before
7 o'clock would have rolled over. I” mnot 100% certain
on that but that’s what

MR JUSTICE FRASER: I'm not sure Mr Henderson necessarily is
to be honest.

When you say “roll the branch” would you like to put
to the witness exactly what you mean by that because we
had quite a lot of evidence about that before Christmas.

MR HENDERSON: Well, I believe the position is that the
position you have reached on the 11tha rolled
forward

A. Yes.

and then when you take the next declaration which we
are looking here on the 13th -- I can’t quite recall
what happened on the 12th, but anyway on the 13th-- it
takes that rolled forward position as the starting
position and it measures it against that?

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And your case is that that line in 15030

Day 3

1 means there is no discrepancy, is that correct?

2 MR HENDERSON: Yes

3 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Right. That's what's being put to you,

4 Mr Patny, that as at the 13th there should be no

5 discrepancy.

6 A. Yes

7 MR HENDERSON: Cash has been found, in other words,

8 A. But like I say the previous day’s was done after

9 7 o'clock so whatever I declared before 7 o'clock would
10 have been taken, so if I had declared zero,
at for instance, before 7 o'clock, that’s -- from my
12 understanding that’s what would have showed the next
13 day. Because the minus 17,000 you have shown me has
14 happened at 19.04 which is after the polling time.
15 Q. Let’s have a look at what I’m suggesting may be the
16 explanation which was the document I was going to go to,
17 which was (F/1514.1}. And this has got some rows
18 highlighted. This is the cash management report for
19 your branch on various days and if we could just scroll
20 right until we can see the Mcolumn, you can see that on
21 10May-- do you see that, which is row 382, do you see
22 that?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. There is £16,070 worth of £10 notes, do you see that?
25 A. Yes

21

1 Q. And then we know -- I don't need to take you through

2 that, but we know that there's £16,000 worth of £10

3 notes remmed in on 11 May, do you recall that?

4 A. 1 believe there was. I wasn't there when the remming in

5 happened.

6 Q. No, but that's your father’s evidence and we have looked

7 at that.

8 So what you would expect on the 11 May at the end of

9 the day is that there would be roughly £32,000 worth of
10 £10 notes, less any notes which you had paid out?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q In fact wecansee that there’s only 22,130, do you see
13 that?
14 A. Yes.
15  Q. Which seems strange?
16 A. Slightly, yes.
17° Q. Andagain I went through this with your father. We know
18 that there's no further £10 notes remmed in on the 12th
19 or the 13th, but if you look at those entries, on the
20 following day you have gone up by £15,000-odd, do you
21 see that?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Now, that suggests, doesn't it, that at around this time
24 there was some sort of problem with counting cash, but
25 it was resolved, you found the cash somewhere? Perhaps

22

it had been put in a safe
a. possibility ?
A. I'mnotsure.

Doyou think that's

It potentially could be, yes.
So doing the best that wecan at this stage, looking at
all the records that we've got, it doesn’t look as
though there is a problem with £17,000, does it? It
looks as though any problem with the cash has now been
resolved.

A. No, because the cash dec still shows £17,000 in plus,
doesn't it, so ..

Q. Okay, well, we have been through that.

Let me--

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Are you moving off that point?

MR HENDERSON: I'm moving off that.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Right. I just want to be clear about an
important point that Mr Henderson has been exploring
with you round the edges and I just want to be
absolutely clear that I understand what your evidence
is.

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: When you thought you were £17,000 down
and you went through the steps on Horizon, did that lead
to you discovering physical cash of £17,000

A. No.
MR JUSTICE FRASER: -- elsewhere -- just wait for me to
23

finish -- which you hadn't counted before?
A. No.
MR JUSTICE FRASER: It didn’t.
A. No.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: So when you say in different places in
your evidence "It all looked okay” or “It all worked
out", whatis it that you mean please?

A. From whatI understand is when I did my

MR JUSTICE FRASER: From what you can remember.

A. Yes. When I did the various adjustments online at the
end of it there looked like there was no discrepancies
at all.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: In terms of information ona screen.

A. Yes, they had made me change various things and that
made it okay.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: All right
mean what?

And by "made it okay” you

A. The discrepancy wasn't something that -- well, wasn’t
alarming, as such.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Right. Over to you.

MR HENDERSON: My Lord, just to be clear, the Post Office's
case is that there were various declarations and various
steps taken and at this period it resulted in no
problem.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Well, it depends how you define

Day 3

“no problem”, Mr Henderson. The way you were putting it
seemed to suggest, in at least two questions, that money
had been discovered physically and that’s very important
and that’s why I needed to clarify what his evidence
was.

MR HENDERSON: I understand.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Because if you roll them up in terms

that can be open to misunderstanding the evidence won't

wyAnRone

9 necessarily be very clear for me.
10 MR HENDERSON: I understand, my Lord,
11 MR JUSTICE FRASER: I know what the Post Office's case is,
12 1 think
13 MRHENDERSON: I understand.

14 I just wanted to ask you about something on document
15 {F/1834.3] and this is a separate point, I think, and

16 again I touched on it with your father, but let_me just
17 ask you. If you could go to sheet 1 and then row 2336
18 and this is the point your Lordship mentioned this

19 morning when there are two cash declarations one after

20 the other.

21 MRJUSTICE FRASER: And what are we calling this document?
22 MRHENDERSON: This is the events spreadsheet.

23 MRJUSTICE FRASER: The events data spreadsheet?

24° MRHENDERSON: Yes.

25 Do yousee that, MrPatny? Row 236?
25

1 AL Yes.

2 Q. Actually 2336. So this is 17 May 2016 and there's two

3 cash declarations only seven minutes apart but for

4 a significant difference , do you see?

5 AL Yes.

6 Q. About £16,000 difference. Now,I think -- do you accept

7 you made these declarations?

8 AL Yes.

9 Q Andagain -- and don’t need to turn this up I don't
10 think, unless you want me to, but we looked yesterday
11 with your father that the transaction data shows that
12 all that had happened between those two times was a
13 A. £300dee.

14 Q. -- £300declaration? Okay. Can you explain how that
15 can happen in that way, that there can be two
16 declarations so close to each other for such differing
17 figures?
18 A. FromwhatIcan see there that I must have been £16,000
19 up for some reason, I have entered in the wrong figure
20 and after when I have changed it it has come to the
21 secondone. I mean that was sometimes when you were
22 entering figures sometimes you could enter them in wrong
23 and, you know, you would end up with a massive gain or
24 a loss and then when you went through and re-entered
25 them again it would come toa more correct figure.

oropr

When you say you re-enter them again, would that involve
physically counting cash again

Sometimes.

-- or checking the piles of cash or whatever it is
you're doing?

Sometimes, but sometimes it could just genuinely be

a case of, you know, as you're rushing through pressing
tab keys -- you have to bear in mind we were serving
customers whilst we were doing this as well. It was
a fairly busy branch after closing times -- well,
general post office closing times are half past five;
because we were one of the very few in the city that
were open after 5.30 so we would get customers coming
from all around, other side of the city coming to us
because they knew there was a post office open, so as
you're rushing through sometimes you didn’t tab

correctly and you would end up instead of writing 20,000
£20 notes you could add the £10 notes of say 10,000
£10notes into that as well so you could end up with
40,000 in £20 notes. Just a minor mistake can cause
Okay. I just wanted to ask you a few questions about
the phone call you had from Debra Lambley, do you
remember this, from Chesterfield about stamps?

Yes.

Again, this wasa call that was prompted by a concern

27

that you had that you had declared a much higher value
of stamps than you could conceivably have been holding
onto, is that right?

Yes.

And that was a declaration that you made?
I never made the declaration of the stamps. I don’t
know how they got there.

Who made the declaration of stamps then?

I did the declaration of stamps, but I never put that

much in, I don't know what

I'msorry, I didn’t hear. You said you made the
declarations --

I declared the stamps but I never entered in that amount
on the £1.09 stamps or whatever that was that caused the
increase

Well, let's havea look at that this. Well, just before
I do that, you were the only one who declared the
stamps?

Yes.

The figure for the declared stamps was ~ we will come
to it, but it’s £18,000. Everyone agrees it is wrong.
Yes.

Can you explain how that came to be wrong?

No.

Isn't it possible that you just made the sort of error

14 Q. Andisn’t it overwhelmingly likely that that’s what 14 that that’s a bug in Horizon?
15 happened here, you made a mistake in declaring the 15 A. Because after I've sorted it out, it’s stayed there.
16 stamps which was picked up and corrected? 16 I'msorry, I didn’t hear?

19 Q. Well, let’s look at it. Let’s look at the call log 19 So why would I change it down and then change it back
20 first of all at {F/1522.1}, row 138. If you just go 20 again? I'd understand you said that I'd made the
21 right to column N: 21 mistake the first time, but I couldn't make the mistake
22 “Call today from Chesterfield and £16,000 adjustment 2.2 again the second time, could 1?
23 now down in the office.” 23 Q. I don't quite understand the point you're making?
24 Not quite sure exactly what that means. 24 A. I’msaying you're saying I potentially could have made
25 “Activity: declarations and adjustments” and if you go 25 a mistake the first time. If 1 did make a mistake the

1 right a couple more, you were told to balance the stock 1 first time, fair enough, but I couldn't make the same

1 came back after I had done that, so then she’s had to 1A. Well, if she didn’t know what we had in the branch then
2 phone me again the following week and her words were 2 how did she know we were £18,000 up on stamps then?
3 “Why have you changed them back?” and I said 3 Q I think the point about that is it is just
4 “I haven't” 4 an extraordinarily high amount which everyone accepts
5 So in answer to your question I could have made 5 would not be the number of stamps ina branch of your
6 a mistake the first time, okay potentially I could have, 6 sort?
7 but then why would I make the same mistake a second 7A. Well, then you can’t have it in -- you're talking
8 time? 8 hypothetically in her defence but talking factually in
9 Q. So what you have said -- if you look at your witness 9 mine, aren't you?
10 statement in paragraph 13 (E1/2/3}, you say: 10 Q No, because! think it is agreed, isn’t it, that you
11 "She told me it was showing the branch had 11 didn’t have anything like £18,000 --
12 overdeclared the amount of stamp stock that was held.” 12 A. No.

19 Q. All right, that’s not shown in that declaration that we 19 declared to the correct figure?

21 A. But she checked it on her side and said that everything 21 is okay.
22 was fine as well 22 Q. Okay. Well, I don’t think I can take that any further

3 okay again and what this has done is somehow the stamps 3 correct amount of stamps are now in holding and
4 have gone back up and Debra has had to ring me again the 4 everything is fine with our branch, but if you have
5 next week. So then as I was answering your original 5 a look the stamps clearly wasn't reduced down but she

7 the first time, I haven't definitely done it the second 7 I verified everything was okay and followed what she
8 time, have I? 8 said.
9 Q Well, I accept it is unclear, Mr Patny, but what appears 9 MRHENDERSON: I want to ask you now, Mr Patny, about the
10 to have been the case according to the stamp 10 MoneyGram transaction. Do you remember this one?
11 declarations is that there was a problem which persisted 11 A. Yes.
12 for a week and then was corrected 12 And your complaint here is that you had a MoneyGram
13 A. But it hasn't corrected though. 13 transaction for money to be sent in the amount of
14 Q. Well, it was corrected on 25 May. 14 £3,100. That transaction didn’t go through, it was
15 A. Onthe day -- Debra rang methe first day, she has 15 cancelled and retried, didn't go through again
16 corrected it. Theissue has persisted, she has rang me 16 A. Yes. The actual transaction wasn't cancelled, just the
17 again a couple of weeks - well, a week anda half later 17 debit card.
18 and she has made me do the same thing again. 18 Q. Okay. Andyousay that youhada shortfall of exactly
19 Q. Andis it possible that you hadn't properly followed the 19 £6,200?
20 instructions that you were given by her over the phone 20 A. Yes.
21 at the time? 21 Q So just to understand what had happened, to make sure
22 A. No, because Debra checked it on her side and said that 22 I have understood this properly, presumably someone
23 everything was okay. 23 comes in, wants to carry out a MoneyGram transaction,

Q. But by which stage you have already got it on your stack
and you have to do something with it in order to balance
the books, if I can just put it in that way?

AL Yes.

Q. Okay. So can we first of all look at the transaction
data which is at (F/1436.1) and if we goto sheet 1 at
the bottom please and enable editing and row 1067.
Thank you. So this is, I believe, the transaction. Do
you see that £3,100?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And what we see is a -- we see two appearances of
£3,100, but that's a single transaction, yes?

AL Yes

Q. But what we don't see at around this time is a second
entry for £3,100. Wedonotsee that. Your evidence
effectively is that we should see that because you say
that this caused a problem of £6,200.

A. No, but from -- what we used to do with MoneyGram, the
procedure was you cash it through, so you cash -- say it

has gone through and then you cancel it at that point

I have done that correctly, but the Post Office had

changed the procedure in December which I wasn’taware

of that you had to cancel it on the back office as well

at that point, so I've never cancelled it there, so that

was still hanging.

then need to use the back office reversals process to
reverse out the transaction.”

And that's the point you are just making, isn’t it?

>

Yes.

2

So you were supposed to follow a two-stage process which

is cancellation and reversal?

A. Yes.

Q. And you just did cancellation

A. Yes.

Q. ~ not reversal?

A. No.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: “No” as in you agree you didn't do
reversal

A. Yes, I agree with what ..

MR HENDERSON: And that procedure, that was part of the
Horizon Online guidance at the time.

MR GREEN: Well, I’m sorry, my Lord, it should be pointed

out to the witness the date of the document that’s not

on Opus yet but we have just seen. The date of this

document is “Operational updates of 19 October 2015", so

it is fair to -- because you can put something in front

of someone and it may influence their confidence about

what they can remember.

MR HENDERSON: Okay. In any event you now accept that there

39

‘was a two-stage process
A. Yes.
that in an ideal world you would have followed, which
is cancellation and reversal

A. (Nods)
And you rang the help desk, didn't you, in relation to
this?

A. I did, yes

Q. Let’s have a look at {F/1522.1}. If we goto row 115.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Is this the call log?

MR HENDERSON: Yes. Thisis your call -- do you see this ,
Mr Patny? This is 23 February 2016, at column D, and if
you go across and then just pause there at N, column N,
you said

“Debit card declined for MoneyGram, how to clear.”
So you had rung to ask what to do about this?

AL Yes.

And then you go across and the advice was” settle to
cash and then cancel and reverse”

AL Yes.

Q. So you were told you did need to reverse it but for
whatever reason you didn’t understand that or you didn’t
do it, but in any event you didn’t reverse it?

A. I didn’t reverse it at the time of the transaction but

I reversed it when the helpline helped me through it

Q. Well, according to Post Office it was never reversed,
It was only cancelled, not reversed.

A. Sorry, are you on about the 7 o’clock phone call here or
the 12 0'clock phone call?

MR JUSTICE FRASER: This phone call is -- well, let's go
back to the left-hand side and we will see the time,
Could we go back to column A. This is at 12.50.

A. Sorry, I was talking about when I rang them later on in
9 the day.

10 MR HENDERSON: You rang them later on in the day?

11 =sA. Yes.

12 Q Well, I had understood you to say before in your

13 evidence that you accepted that you had not reversed the

14 transaction?

15 A. No, I hadn’t reversed it in the back office, no.

16

17 A. I did after I spoke to the help desk, who they told me

2

Are you saying that you did reverse it in due course?

18 I had to reverse it at the back office.
19 Q. Okay. Soas far as the data is concerned and as far as
20 the Post Office is concerned you did not reverse it.
21 You did cancel it

22 A. Yes.

23. Q. Butyoudid no not reverse it?

24 A. No.

25  MRJUSTICE FRASER: At 12.50.

al

MR HENDERSON: Atall.

A. As the transaction took place I believe at midday,
I cancelled it, I never reversed it at that point.
I reversed it in the evening when I did my cash dec and
saw I was short and I reversed it after speaking to the
NSBC[sic] because at that point I was still unaware that

I had to reverse it on the back office. Reversals take

place on the back office, cancellations was on the front

10 Q. Mysuggestion to you, Mr Patny, is whether or not you

11 understood the process, as a matter of fact you didn’t

12 effectively reverse the transaction?

13. A. I didn’t reverse it when! should have, but I did later

14 on.

15 Q. Okay. I’mjust being clear, I am saying you didn’t

16 succeed in reversing the transaction at all?

17 A. Butwedid, we reversed it later on, didn't we?

18 Q. Well, as far as the evidence the Post Office can see

19 that didn’t happen. It did cancel, didn't reverse?
20 A. It did cancel and it did reverse but because that’s
21 after -- once again, after 7 o'clock, the issue was the
22 day's data had been polled so I have effectively it
23 doesn’t look like I have done it on that day, where in
24 terms of date I have but for business dates I haven't
25 done it on that date

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And you think there's a second phone
call, did you say?
A. Yes. That's here, this quarter past 7 one, that’s the

second phone call

MR JUSTICE FRASER: When you say “that's here”, what are you
pointing out?

A. 116is it? No, sorry I saw it -- if you scroll across.
There, 116, “Cash dec £6,000 short due to MoneyGram”.
That took place at quarter past 7.

MR HENDERSON: Okay and you say “Short due to MoneyGram
refund did not do the existing reversal ”

A. Yes.

Okay. And carry on across. Just look at 117 below
that, what does that involve, “Cancellation refund”?
Can we just go back to the beginning of 117. And can
you go across from 117. Here youare ringing again
saying:

“Asking if the discrepancy has been resolved yet
waiting for a TCto be issued - had failed to reverse
a [MoneyGram] for £6,000 that was cancelled on the same
day as having been sent”

A. So the next day when I rang up I have asked “Where's
the TC?"; I wasn't aware that a TC took several days to
come.

Q. Okay, but there is a single transaction here of £3,100?

43

AL Yes.

Q. Right. The process is it needs to be cancelled and
reversed?

A. Yes.

Q You only cancelled it?

AL Yes.

Q. You then think you may have reversed it?

A. I did reverse it, as youcan see there, quarter past 7

in the evening.
Q. Well, on 117 it says that it had failed to reverse

‘a MoneyGram for 6,000, which is not right, it’s

‘a MoneyGram for 3,100?
AL Yes.
And can we carry on going across on 117. Okay, so doing
the best we can, MrPatny, and I appreciate these things
are not as straightforward as they could be, it looks as
though there has been a transaction for £3,100
Yes.
-- which has not been reversed properly?
At the time

oPropr

In other words you need a transaction correction for
£3,100?

A. Wedo, yes.

Q. And just to be quick about it, you in fact receive

a transaction correction for £3,100, don't you?

13 to havea brief break now? 13 the effect of increasing the declaration of stamps is to

15 We're going to have a short break. Today it is 15 A. I wasn’t aware of that, no.
16 going to be seven minutes long. It is for the shorthand 16 Q. All right. So let’s go back to the MoneyGram
17 writers just to havea break from transcribing 17 transaction and just to remind you where we had got to

1 MRHENDERSON: Mr Patny, I want to just ask you a couple 1 Q. Separately from the transaction correction?

2 more questions about the stamp situation before I come 2 AL Yes.

3 back to the MoneyGram situation that we were dealing 3 So you both reversed it and you received a transaction

4 with before. 4 correction?

5 Do you agree with this, that if a declaration of 5 A. Yes.

6 stamps goes up, the cash position is automatically 6 That makes you £3,100 up, doesn’t it?

7 decreased, isn’t it? 7 A. No, because the reversal happened on the wrong

8 A. I'mnotsure. I don’t know that. As in do you mean for 8 day --well, on the wrong business day, because once

9 overall, or holding 9 again if you have a look at the call log, I spoke to
10 Q. It automatically happens, doesn’t it, that as the 10 them at quarter past 7 and they told me to do this,
a1 declaration of stamps goes up, the cash position will go 11 7 o'clock is polling. So it would have polled as the
12 down? 12 £6,200 short for the day.
13° A. I don’t see why that would, Thecash is going to remain 13 Q. MrPatny, it has nothing to do with the day. If you
14 the same, isn't it, if stamps go up? 14 have reversed the transaction with the effect that
15 Q. Let mepurit in a different way. If you were trying to 15 you're no longer losing that £3,100 and you're getting

17 to declare too much by way of stamps, isn’t it? 17 up, don’t you?
18 A. No. 18 A. No.
19 Q. You disagree with that? 19 Is that what you're saying happened?

short MoneyGram", that to me meant it doubled up
9 somewhere and overall there had been an issue there:

10 MoneyGram told me to reverse it on the back office , they

at made me do various things and they said --

12. MR JUSTICE FRASER: When you say MoneyGram told you?

13 A. NotMoneyGram, sorry, the helpline told me. They also

14 said a transaction correction would be sent to balance
15 out the losses.
16 So that’s what they made me do. Now, the issue is
17 on that day it would have polled as a £6,200 shortfall
18 because at 7 o'clock that’s when the polling happens and
19 the business day ceases as such, so I finished the day
20 as technically the business day I have not corrected it
21 onthe right day, but date-wise I have actually done it
22 on that day, because I have done it after 7 o'clock. So
23 the next day I phoned up to ask -- because we had never
24 had an issue like this before of where the TC was and
25 where the money was and they said it takes a few days to
49

1 generate and that’s what's happened.

2. MRJUSTICE FRASER: Just two questions from me about

3 MoneyGram so I can understand. MoneyGram is where

4 somebody wants to send some money overseas.

5 AL Yes.

6 MRJUSTICE FRASER: And itis done in a secure way.

7A. Yes

8 MRJUSTICE FRASER: So they come into your post office and

9 either give you cash or give youa debit card and you
10 take the money from them.
11 A. Yes.
12 MR JUSTICE FRASER: And then the recipient in another
13 country can use that MoneyGram account to withdraw that
14 money, is that correct?
15 A. Yes.
16 MRJUSTICE FRASER: So when the gentleman came in to try and
17 do this transfer and his debit card was declined, am
18 I right in concluding that that means you didn't take
19 any money off him for his MoneyGram, is that right?
20 A. No, his card declined twice.
21 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Which meant he could not then ~ or
22 whoever it was, his relative or friend in another
23 country could not have the benefit of the money that you
24 hadn't taken
25 A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER:

AL Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Over to you, Mr Henderson.

MR HENDERSON: My Lord and just to be clear as to the
Post Office's position which I anticipate your Lordship
understands, it is accepted that the issue arose in
relation to 3,100 and there was a transaction correction

is that right?

in relation to it, which is accepted --
MR JUSTICE FRASER: The issue being .?
MR HENDERSON: The issue is whether there was a double
transaction for 6,200. And that’s what
MR JUSTICE FRASER: Because you did ~as I understand it,
and youcan correct me if I’m wrong and Mr Henderson you
can correct me if I'mwrong-- you did get a transaction
correction for £3,100.

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And that took a number of days, is that
right?

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Am I right?

MR HENDERSON: Correct.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Over to you.

MR HENDERSON: But what I have been exploring with the
wimess is his suggestion, which I didn’t understand

from his witness evidence, that he had additionally

51

reversed the transaction and if he had effectively

reversed the transaction he wouldn't be entitled to

a transaction correction. But there is a single
transaction here and the data shows a single transaction
of £3,100

MR JUSTICE FRASER: When you say “the data’, are you talking
about

MR HENDERSON: The transaction data

MR JUSTICE FRASER: But not the call log.

MR HENDERSON: Not the call log, no, but the transaction
data. But the call log suggests, as we were looking at
before -- it might be sensible

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Well, let’s not go into the arena of you
explaining it to me because youare still in the middle
of cross-examining him.

MR HENDERSON: No, indeed.

So let’s explore the suggestion that I have put to
you just before the break, Mr Patny, that your loss was
exactly £6,200. Do you remember that?

AL Yes.

Q. So can we look at {F/1507.1}.

to take the filter off and go to row 1903. Now, this is

If we goto -- youneed

a bit fiddly, MrPatny, and I apologise for that but we
need just to take this in stages.
So the actual discrepancy that you experienced and

declared at the end of 23 February was not for £6,200,
it was for £6,825.95. Do yousee that?

A. Yes.

Q. Soin itself that does not suggest that there is
a problem for £6,200, does it, in itself? I'm going to
go on.

A. No.

Q. But we need to look at the previous day and if we look
at -- it maybesensible if you just make a note
your Lordship may take the arithmetic from me, but we
have a declaration of 25,803.87. Let's look at the
previous declaration of cash

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Sorry, where? Oh, you are taking it
from the line above, 25,803, yes.

MR HENDERSON: My Lord, yes, 25,803.87, discrepancy of
6,825.95. And if you look at the previous day which is
row 1717, that is cash declaration for that day of
34,405.46. Do you see that?

AL Yes.

Q. So there is movement between the 22nd and the 23rd in
the cash declaration figure of £8,601.59. Perhaps you
would accept that from me. Your maths is probably
better but that’s fine.

So what I want to explore is whether we can see the

figure of 6,200 somewhere in that figure. Do you

53

understand?

AL Yes.

Q. Now, the first thing is we can havea look at what the
session data shows us for cash transactions over the
relevant period and this is to be found in document
{F/1436.1.1}. Sheet 1.

My Lord, I should just explain this, and Mr Patny
I should just explain this document. This is
transaction data filtered for trading date and cash
between the times of the two cash declarations that
I have just taken you to, MrPatny. Do you understand
that?

AL Yes.

Q. Now, this is a document that we have created for the
purposes of today in order to demonstrate this point
because otherwise it is just too painful to makeit.

I have explained it to MrGreen and Mr Green if you
Just go to the top of that document ~ sorry, before you
do so, just look at the figure of 1,806.71 which is in
row 216, That's the total of the decrease in cash in
the branch, okay?

A. Okay.

Q. And if we just go to the top of the document, it is
right to say that column U, “Calculation”, is one that

we have added, all right? That's not one that appears

in the actual transaction log. So we have filtered this
in order to demonstrate the movement of cash of

1,806.71, Does that make sense?

Yes.

It is a figure that you will see in Ms van den Bogerd’s
witness statement in I think paragraph 74 (E2/5/20},

I think from memory.

So taking it in stages, we started with a figure of
1,806 as the movement in cash. We've got the MoneyGram
transaction for 3,100 which we know about which at this
stage the transaction correction hasn't been issued,
okay, so that’s another 3,100. So the total decrease
that wecan account for is 3,100 plus 1,806.71, which
leaves £3,694.88 of cash movement unaccounted for.

Do you agree with the approach I have taken at
least? I appreciate it’s very difficult for you to
agree with specific figures .

I'm trying to understand what you're saying, yes

Okay. ‘The point that I'm putting, clumsily and at great
length, is that there is not a discrepancy of £3,100.

It is a figure of over £3,600.

Right

So when you say that there was a shortfall of exactly
£6,200, that’s just not right, is it?

Well, according to your calculations there it's

55

different , yes, but that 6,200 -- when I’m saying
“exactly” it could be to the pence but I’m claiming that
3,100 times two which showed up as a shortfall on my
cash dec

Well, Ms van den Bogerd suggests that it is much more
likely to have been -- I mean the 3,100 for the
MoneyGram is one thing, but for the rest of it it’s much
more likely to be a cash handling problem ora user
error when making cash declarations, Can you say that
she is wrong in saying that?

Well, yes, I can.

On what basis?

On what basis can she say that that’s a cash user.
Because there's no indication in any of this data that
there were two lots of £3,100 that were processed in any
way, There is every indication that there was one lot
of £3,100 and the story that is told in relation to that
£3,100 makes entire sense. There is no indication of
the £6,200.

The only points I can raise to that is we spoke to our
area manager, Mark Irwin(?), we showed him all this
evidence and he agreed with us that it seemed like this
had doubled up and he is the one who put the block on
our behalf of Chesterfield asking for this money. So

Mark Irwin is obviously a Post Office employee and he

“Branch still waiting a call back. Call closed,
Sarah ESG advised to assign to your stack to call the
office back. No details listed on the call regarding
how the incorrect cash rem is dealt with.”

Did you ever receive back the Credence report you
understood you were going to get?

A. No.

And did the sums that we have been looking at here,
stamps and cash, £17,000, feature in the special audit?

A. They did, yes.

MR GREEN: No further questions, my Lord.

Questions from MR JUSTICE FRASER

MR JUSTICE FRASER: I have two questions.

Can we go to {F/1507.1} please. Right, that doesn’t
appear to be the document I was expecting it to be.
Mr Henderson, you are going to have to help me with this
then because it was the document that showed the
discrepancies, do you remember? Row 1903 had the
discrepancy of 6,825 on 23 February 2016 and a total
cash figure of 25,803.87 and you were comparing that
with

MR HENDERSON: Yes, my Lord, that's 1507.1
filter off.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Oh, I do beg your pardon. Could we take
the filter off. ‘Thank you very much. Right, if we can

If we take the

63

go to row 1903 please.
You were asked, Mr Patny, about the discrepancy on

23 February. Do you remember those questions?

A. Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And you were shown row 1903 which had
a discrepancy of £6,825.
of 25,803 and a discrepancy of 6,825.

AL Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And as I understand your answers, the
£6,200 is within or should be within the 6,825
discrepancy, is that correct?

It hada declare to cash total

A. Yes
MR JUSTICE FRASER: Is that a correct understanding?
AL Yes

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Ifyou go to the previous day which is
on 1717, you were asked about the cash declaration of
34,405. And that was the cash total I think for the
previous day, is that right?

A. Yes

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Which is 34,405. And you were then
taken to another document which I'm not going to take
you to, to examine the movement of cash from one day to
the next.

AL Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And that I think is the document which

you said you had been asking for which you referred to
as a Credence report.

‘A. 1 believe that’s what the Credence report is.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: But if you look on 22 February there are
also two other entries. One is immediately above 1717
which shows a cash discrepancy I think of £781 and one
is a cash discrepancy in row 1718 which shows £31. Do
you see those two figures?

AL Yes

MR JUSTICE FRASER: If 1 want to go away and compare like
with like, should I be taking just the cash declaration
the day before, or should I taking the cash declaration
and the discrepancy the day before

A I'm

MR JUSTICE FRASER:
declaration and the discrepancy for the following day?

A. I think the second one would be more beneficial to you,
wouldn't it, because then you can see

MR JUSTICE FRASER: So therefore is it correct that as at
22 February whatever the discrepancy was on these

and comparing it with the cash

figures, that is not included in the 34,405 figure; is
that right? Or is it?

A. That £31.07 -- that 34,405 should be, to my
understanding, after that £31 discrepancy.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: That was my understanding. And does the

65

same point apply for the two figures the day before as
well?

AL Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: So if ever you look at the cash figure
you have to look at the cash figure plus the
discrepancy, is that right?

AL Yes.

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: Thank you very much.

That's all my questions. Thank you very much for
coming. You are now free to leave the witness box.
Right, Mr Green.
MR GREEN: My Lord, 1am calling Mrs Burke now.
MRS ANGELA BURKE (sworn)

Examination-in-chief by MR GREEN

MR GREEN: Mrs Burke, there will be a folder in front of
you. Move that sheet of paper away. You can put the
loose sheet away somewhere else because that was
separate and if you very kindly havea look in tab 4
{£1/4/1), you will see "Amended witness statement of
Angela Burke"?

A. No. I've got no employment.

Yes.
You see a signature there.

Is that your signature?

Cross- examination by MR DRAPER

A. Hello.

MR DRAPER: Good afternoon, Mrs Burke. You just said you
were an assistant at Newport which was your husband's
branch.

A. That's correct, yes
I understand that before that you were also yourself
a subpostmistress, is that right?

A. Yes, that’s right.

In total then how long have you worked as either
a subpostmistress or an assistant?

A. I have worked with the Post Office since I was 16 on and
off, sometimes in sub-post offices , sometimes I had
three -- probably five years as subpostmaster and then
intermittently as an assistant

Q. Can you give any indication of the number of years
during which you were an assistant; are we talking five,
ten or more?

A. Let mejust think. Probably about 15.

I just want to ask you quickly about a change that you

recently made to your witness statement. If you have it
there in front of you, in paragraph 8 (£1/4/2] you say
that you and your husband never had any major issues
with unexplained shortfalls during your time running the
branch.

Day 3

1A. That's right

2 Q. You then say there was £1 here or there but never

3 anything more than that. In that paragraph the word

4 “unexplained” was added recently. I’m going to ask you

5 what you mean by that but I’m going to suggest what it

6 maybe. Is that clarification because you did have some

7 shortfalls that were over £1 but you were able to

8 investigate and resolve them?

9 A. That's correct, yes.

10 Q. Anddoyousay you were able to do that typically at the

11 end of the day when you carried out your cash,

12 declaration, you would identify the shortfall and then

13 look into it, is that right?

14 A. Usually, yes.

15 Q. If you identified a shortfall of a fairly substantial

16 size, say £50 or £100, much more than a pound, and you

17 were unable that evening to identify where it had come

18 from, was your practice to contact Post Office?

19 A. No.

20 Q. Did that situation not arise?

21 A. No~ normally if youhada shortfall and -- you would

22 try and investigate it yourself and try and find out

23 what the cause of it wasand if you didn’t know it, you

24 would hopefully -- I mean in days gone by it could have

25 been that it could be a transaction that had been sent
69

1 off and you had recorded it wrong and an error notice

2 in the old days -- would come. They have now been

3 replaced by transaction corrections .

4 Q. So you're saying sometimes where even if you had

5 a relatively substantial shortfall , for the time being

6 you might assume that a transaction correction would

7 come and correct it?

8 A. That's right, yes.

9 Q Is that right? Andin your experience is that what
10 happened in those circumstances where you had those kind
11 of shortfalls ?

12 A. Usually, yes.

13  Q. In your witness statement you describe a problem you had
14 with recovering transactions on 9 May 2016.

15 A. Right.

16 Q. Yougive the details of a number of transactions that

17 either didn’t go through at all or had to be recovered.
18 The only one I want to ask you about is the £150

19 withdrawal.

20 A. Okay.

21 Q Before I do that it would be helpful to take you to some
22 images of the Horizon screen so we can make sure that

23 we're talking about the same thing when I describe the
24 process. So if wecould call up please (E2/4/6} and
25 could we zoom in please on the first image on that page.

This is obviously not a photograph, it is an image to
represent the front office home sereen on

Horizon Online. If you look towards the right of the
screen there, Mrs Burke, where it says British Gas in
blue
Yes

do you see that?

And then below it in red “Total due from custome!
Yes.

That section of the screen I suggest is what we will
refer to as the basket or stack?

Yes, that's correct

And products and services that you enter into the system
by using the buttons that we see on the rest of this
image then stack up in that section of the screen, is
that right?

Yes, that’s correct

‘And each one of those items when it goes into the stack
will show a price which may be negative or it might be
positive and that depends on whether that product or
service involves payment to or payment from the branch.
Yes.

That's right, isn’t it?

Yes.

Could you speak up please

Yes, that’s right.

7

And underneath the stack, as we have just established ,
in this image it says "Total due from customer” and it
is in red, but it might also, if the transactions were
different, say “Total due to customer” in which case it
would be green?

Yes, that’s correct

And whether you get a green or a red section there
depends on the net effect of all the transactions in the
stack, doesn't it?

Yes

So if we take, for example, this British Gas payment, if
the same customer in this transaction were then to ask
to withdraw £100 and you were to process that
withdrawal, it would then go into the stack and the net
effect would change, wouldn't
Yes

And that would be because there would then be cash due

, to be in green?

to the customer?

That's correct

‘Taking the two transactions together?
Yes, it would.

Going back then to the failed transaction on 9 May, in
your witness s
paragraph - and I will take youto it -

fement you seem to suggest in one
that once the

£150 withdrawal was authorised, Horizon then instructed

Day 3

1 you to pay that amount over to the customer.

2A. Yes, that's right

3 Q By that, when you use that kind of language, do you

4 simply mean that the withdrawal went into the stack that

5 we have just seen?

6 A. When the £150 withdrawal was done, the customer was

7 inserting a card into the PIN pad on his side of the

8 counter, He would put the card in, when the transaction

9 authorised it would bring “Authorised” on the PIN pad on
10 the customer's side of the screen. It would put the
at £150 onto the stack on my side of the screen and then it
12 would print off a receipt off the Horizon printer and
13 the receipt that came off there said “Authorised, £150"
14 and then that’s passed to the customer and then you pay
15 the customer. Press the “enter” button and pay the
16 customer.
17 Q Sorry, press the “enter” key and then pay the customer?
18 A. Yes
19 Q. That's the only point 1 wanted to clarify with you is
20 that ordinarily what you would do ~ I’m not talking
21 about 9 May whatyou actually did, but what you should
22 normally do is get all of the transactions, including
23 any withdrawals, into the stack that we have looked at
24 and then when the customer wants no more products or
25 services you close the stack, or we would say submit it,

73

1 by either pressing “enter” or “fast cash” or any other

2 way that closes the basket and ends the session; that’s

3 right, isn’t it?

4 A. If youdo that you can’t see what's actually - you've

5 got to then memorise then because as soon as you press

6 that button and it goes there’s no -- you've got no

7 reference as what you're actually paying the customer

8 because it will clear it, so you won't be able to see on

9 the screen what you're supposed to be paying and if the
10 customer then queries anything there will not be any
a1 information on your screen because it have gone.
12 Q. I see, so whatyou say is you would prepare whatever
13 money was due to the customer and then you may hand
14 money over once you had the money in your hand, or you
15 may click “enter” or "fast cash” and then hand it over,
16 but the twoare basically at the same time! think you
17 are saying on a normal transaction?
18 A. You would normally take the money out, you would say it
19 is £75 to pay or whatever -- like this case yousay 150.
20 You would have the 150, you count the 150, press the
21 “enter” and it would clear
22 Q. Andon 9 May, the situation we're talking about, on the
23 right-hand side of your screen here you would have had
24 three transactions stacked up; that’s right, isn’t it?
25 A. Yes.

You would have had the two for the customer earlier, the
gentleman who was withdrawing money from two different
cards?
Yes.
And you would have had the 150 from the customer who was
presently before you?
Yes

Normally you wouldn't have two customers’
transactions at the stack on onetime. It was just the
circumstances on that day were exceptional. The systems
were slow, because they was connecting I had two
customers’ transactions on there, but I actually said
that in my statement, that there was two customers.
Yes, you have explained that you wouldn't ordinarily do
it
No.

it wasn’t the procedure you were supposed to
follow --
Yes.

but you were doing it in difficult circumstances?
That's right, that’s correct
Could I ask you to turn to the witness statement of
a Post Office witness, Ms van den Bogerd, which is at
{E2/5/25},
you seen this witness statement before, Mrs Burke?

It should come up onin your sereen. Have

75

Yes, I have seen that.
Can I ask you to read to yourself please paragraph 105,
It largely confirms what we have just discussed.
(Pause).
Yes.
Sorry, over the page as well please (E2/5/26}, just
finishing paragraph 108.
(Pause).
Right, yes.
Do you agree with what is said there?
I have read what she has said, but I have no idea of how
the back office procedures of Horizon work. We're
trained on transactions and how to process transactions,
we have no idea about how the system in the back
connects to Horizon, when it goes to a bank, how it

checks the bank or when it feeds things back.

Sure.
‘We're not
Sure. I'mnot trying to suggest that you're aware of

the technical data
No.

the data processing, everything that goes on within
the system. What I suggest you would have known is that
it is when youclose the stack that the transactions in

the stack go into your accounts?

Day 3

1 isn’t it?
2 A. That's correct, yes, but that took two minutes to come
3 upto after I had been serving the customer.
4 Q. Yes. And then what you next saw -- I'm just running you
5 through the documents. What you next saw is the
6 document at {F/1464}. This again, Mrs Burke, was a few
7 minutes later this receipt was printed; that’s right,
8 isn’t it?
9 A. Correct.
10 Q Andyou say in your witness statement that what you
at initially understood from this receipt was that the two
12 transactions listed on it had failed to recover; that’s
13 right, isn’t it?
14 A. Yes
15 Q Andyou inferred from that that the third transaction
16 for £150 had been successfully recovered?
17 A. Yes
18 Q Younow understand, it seems from your witness

19 statement, that what this receipt was intended to convey

20 was two things. 1, there had beena failure of recovery
21 for some transactions, one or more, but that these two
22 listed had been recovered?
23 A. Yes. I found that out when I went through my
24 transaction log and I started to tick off the
25 transactions, then I realised that the “recovery failed”
81
1 wasn't the fail -- the items it showed weren't the
2 failed transactions, they were the ones that had
3 actually gone through and it was the other transaction
4 that had failed .
5 Q Yes. Shall we look at the -- the transaction log is at
6 {F/1465}. So you printed this off within a matter of
7 minutes, as I understand it, is that right?
8 A. It wasafter I had closed the branch.
9 Q So approximately how long, do you think?
10 A. I did say in my statement. CanI just refer to it?
11. Q. Well, the "recovery failed” receipt was printed at 9.36.
12 We see that at paragraph 17 of your statement (E1/4/3).
13 You don’t actually say at paragraph 17
14 A. 9.36, yes.

15  MRJUSTICE FRASER: You phoned the helpline after you had
16 closed the branch?

17 A. Yes. I served another couple of customers and there
18 ‘were some problems with connection then and then

19 I decided to close the branch and then I went and ran
20 off the transaction log and that’s when I sat down,
21 closed the branch and worked through it.

22  MRJUSTICE FRASER: And at the end of paragraph 18, did you
23 then phone the helpline?

24 A. I phoned the helpline -- I think it was

25 MRJUSTICE FRASER: So we can work the time window out,

82

1 think,
MR DRAPER: Yes, my Lord.
Looking at this document that you have on screen at

the moment, Mrs Burke --

A. It would have been about 9.34. It would have been after
the -- because that’s -- when the 253 total came up.

Q. In any event, the precise time is --

A. About-- say 9.34.
Yes, so you printed off this transaction log that we can
see on screen and we can see from your handwritten
annotation on it the ticks on the transactions that you
expected to see and do see there and you have then
indicated between two transactions that the £150
withdrawal was missing.

A. Yes.

Q. So you were able to work out quite quickly from looking

at this transaction log that one of the transactions you

expected to see wasn't there?

Yes.

>

Q. It’s from that that you corrected what you had
understood from the “recovery failed” receipt?
Yes

You saw it was the other way round?

It was the other way round, yes.

oPrPoPr

So by this point, after you have sat down with the

83

transaction log, you knew you had had a system outage,
problem with the system, you knew that the session you
were in when the outage occurred had a problem, because
you had the discontinued session receipt?

A. Yes.
You knew that the recovery process on Horizon, the
automatic recovery process, had failed in some way; you
knew that from your "recovery failed” receipt?

A. Yes.
And you had been able to identify from this transaction
log which transaction it was that had not been
recovered?

A. Yes.
And that meant that in this fairly short space of time
you were able to work out that the £150 withdrawal for
which you had physically paid out had not gone into your
accounts?

A. Yes.
And you knew that the result of that was that unless you
obtained a transaction correction to put the transaction
into your accounts, you were going to have a £150

24 would have balanced, but as it was it wasn’t there, so 24 A. Because! had paid the customer the money.
25 my accounts didn’t balance. 25 Yes. So that’s the first point
85 87
1 Q. Yes, I appreciate that. I’m focusing quite closely, if 1 A. And it wasn’t recorded on my transaction log.
2 I may, on the wording of the last sentence of 2 And secondly, you could see that discrepancy, couldn't

5 system for the discrepancy to be identified.” 5 Q. Yes. And if you were -- we will come back to it,
6 Stopping there, I suggest to you that’s wrong 6 my Lord.
7 because you knew exactly what the discrepancy would be, 7 ‘The next step then, after whatwe have just gone
8 it would bea £150 shortfall. So that’s not correct, is 8 through, is that you call the helpline; that’s right,

11 the answer and then 11 Q. Youcan see the transcript at {F/1466}. Before we look
12 A. Well, the Horizon system didn’t identify it; I knew it 12 at the detail of it, it’s this call to the helpline that

20 you knew what the cause of a £150 shortfall would be, 20 ‘would you be happy for me to ask you questions about it?
21 didn’t you? 21 A. I think I would be happy. There will be odd bits

that there were people other than the helpline operators
here, you were told about the IT service desk,
essentially this was being investigated by someone else
and they would get back to you with the results; that’s
fair, isn’t it?
A. They didn’t say they would get back to me. I can’t
recall them saying they would come back to me.
Q. If youlook at the third entry from the bottom,
Mrs Burke it is not precisely in those words ~ third
entry from the bottom, last sentence:

MR DRAPER: Mrs Burke, we have just got through before the
break the helpline call, going through the transcript
‘The next step that you explain in your witness statement
is the things that you yourself did to track down the
customer and obtain records from him and from his bank.

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. And it’s right, isn’t it, that it was on 12 May that you
went with the customer to his bank to obtain
confirmation of the withdrawal?

A. That's right

Q. And it is one day after that, on 13 May, that your
husband spoke toa lady at Post Office and he was told
in that telephone call that your branch could expect to
receive a transaction correction?

AL Yes.

Q. Presumably it was in that call, onthe 13th, that you or
your husband told Post Office about everything that you
had done in the meantime?

‘A. Yes, we told them that we had seen -- that we had seen
the “authorised” receipt from the customer and that we

had also got the statement from the bank to show that

the money had gone out of the customer's bank account,
even though it had not appeared on our system.
1 should make clear before moving on that Post Office
makes absolutely no criticism of you for doing all that
work yourself and for having tracked the customer down
and similarly I didn’t intend to criticise you earlier
about the impression you took from the telephone call .
You were understandably frustrated. I just wanted to
make that clear.
Fine
The point I do intend to challenge in your witness
statement is a relatively small one, which is your
suggestion that the shortfall in your branch would not
have been resolved if you hadn't done the work that you
did. Do you follow?
I understand what you're saying
It mighthelp to take it from your statement at
paragraph 27, which is {E1/4/5). It is the second
sentence in that paragraph, Mrs Burke, That’s the only
one I want to address with you at the moment. You say
there:

*Based upon my initial experience of the helpline,
I do not think that Post Office would have resolved this
if I had not had the clear proof that the £150
transaction had in fact been authorised and that the

95

money had left the customer's bank account”
No.
You of course were not aware at the time in May 2016, or
indeed when you prepared this witness statement, of the
steps that were going on in the background at
Post Office and at Fujitsu, were you?
No
What I intend to do is show you some documents produced
during that process that I will suggest show that
Post Office and Fujitsu were dealing with the problem
and would have been able to resolve it. Do you follow?
I follow
The first documentis at (F/1470.1}. This is what is
called a BIMS incident report which is a wonderfully
tautologous phrase because BIMS stands for business
incident management service, which is a function
performed by Fujitsu

You see at the bottom that this is a document
produced by Mr Andy Dunks. Do you see that in the
rectangle at the bottom of the page “Analyst” on the
right?
Yes.
You can take it from me that he is a Fujitsu employee.
This is a report that Fujitsu has generated to identify
branches affected by the outage on 9 May. Again, in the

“On the 9th May 2016 there was a major outage at
branches that caused multiple transactions to fail

Do you see that?

Yes.

And do you see that this document is dated 12 May,
that’s in the same box after “Actions: date and time”?
Yes

So am I right to say this is then the same dateas that
on which you went to the customer's bank with him?

Yes.

Going right to the bottom of this document, do you see
at the bottom it says:

“The resultant spreadsheet has been attached to the
same email that this BIMS has been sent”
Yes.

I can then show you that email quickly. It is at

So this is the email that attaches the

And it says in the last sentence of the email:

"I have attached a spreadsheet containing the list
of all transactions that require POL ..”

and an authorised receipt was produced on the
counter. However, when the user attempted to settle the
transaction it failed due to the known data centre issue
at the time so disconnected session receipts were
produced and the user was logged off. ‘The user managed
to log back in but recovery also failed. As

an authorised receipt was produced the user should have
handed money over to the customer but we cannot be
certain that they actually did so. Assuming money was
handed over the customer account will be correet but the
branch will have a shortage given that the transaction
hasn’t been recorded on the system. ‘This will need to
be manually reconciled.”

So what I suggest is it looks, doesn’t it, like
whoever at Fujitsu wrote this didn’t know whether or not
you had paid money over the counter, is that right?

Yes, they have put they don’t know if it was handed over
even though I had already called in and said we had paid
the customer. So they knew on the 9th that I had paid
the customer.

Remember, Mrs Burke, this is a Fujitsu document rather
than a Post Office documento this is the people
managing the system and what I suggest is this is what
they have discerned from the data available to them on

the system, Do you follow?

99

Right.
And that they have essentially obtained data reports on
the thousands of branches that were affected and this is
what they can see from their data.

So do you see then that Fujitsu says, on the
assumption that the money was handed over,
reconciliation would be required?
Right. Yes, I can see what they're saying.
Continuing with this account of what's going on in the
background, Post Office then produces a spreadsheet to
show whatit is doing in response to this analysis from
Fujitsu and that’s at {F/1848.5}.
document that will take a moment to come up. Do you see
there, Mrs Burke, row 13 that’s been highlighted?

It is another

Yes
And we see in column A the branch code but helpfully the
branch name in column Bas well. Then if the screen can
be moved over a little please. Column His the same, it
is the statement we have already seen from Fujitsu. that

MR JUSTICE FRASER: You're not? You are cross-examining
Mr Roll, are you?

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: 1am cross-examining Mr Roll and there

will be no questions about that PEAK. It is there for
an entirely separate, coincidental reason.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Is Mr Roll going into tomorrow?

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Yes, I would expect so.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Are there going to be any questions on
that PEAK tomorrow?

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: No.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: No, all right.

Well then that means there won't be a situation

where you need to speak to Mr Roll overnight and he will

105

be in purdah.

MR GREEN: My only anxiety, my Lord, is if it arises in the
evidence of someone else and I haven't dealt with it
I don’t want to be -- could I just have five minutes to
make sure?

MR JUSTICE FRASER: I'm not going to give you five minutes,

easiest way of dealing with it. So we will come back in

Cross-examination by MR DE GARR ROBINSON

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Mr Roll, you say that between 2001 and

2004 you worked at Fujitsu. and you deseribe it in

107

paragraph 2 of your first statement (E1/7/1} as working
in third/fourth line support.

1 would just like to ask you some general questions
about the support teams first of all and for that
purpose I would like to ask you to look at Mr Parker's
first witness statement, the reference is {E2/11/5}. It
will come up on the sereen for you. You will see that
Mr Parker says in paragraph 24:

“There were four lines of support for Horizon while
Mr Roll was employed by Fujitsu and they are described
in paragraph 26 below. Thereare still four lines of
support ..7

Stopping there actually there is a general question
I should ask which is that you know that Mr Parker has
made three witness statements, don’t you, in this
matter?

I know he has made some witness statements, I don't know
how many.

Have you read any of them?

I have looked at them briefly

Have you looked at all of them briefly or just some of
them briefly?

I don’t think I have read all of them.

Okay. His first witness statement, the witness

statement that we're now looking at, have you read that

Day 3

1 carefully or briefly?

2 A. Briefly.

3 Q. Paragraph 25, perhaps! could ask you to read that

4 paragraph very quickly to yourself

5 (Pause).

6 A. Yes

7 Q. That's true, isn't it, what's said there?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. And thenhe describes in paragraph 26 the four lines of
10 support for Horizon. The first line involved several
11 different elements. This is in paragraph 26.1. First
12 of all he refers to the Horizon service desk, which was
13 a help desk operated by Fujitsu thar branches could
14 contact with issues relating to Horizon application or
15 hardware provided in branch. Then over the page
16 (£2/11/6}, in 26.1.2 he said
17 “There was also a Ist line communications management
18 team operated by Fujitstt which specifically focused on
19 ‘communication incidents
20 And then finally in 26.1.3 he says:

21 “Post Office also operated a Ist line help desk for
22 operational issues called the national business support
23 centre ..”
24 Are you able to confirm that all those facts are
25 true from your own knowledge?

109

1 A. I don't remember.

2 Q. Youdo know that Post Office operateda first line help

3 desk for operational issues called the national business

4 support centre, don’t you?

5 A. Therewasa first line support desk and I believe it was

6 shared between Fujitsu and the Post Office, or ICL and

7 the Post Office as it was when I joined, but I don't

8 recall what the splits were or anything like that.

9 Q That's fair
10 Then if I could ask you to read the next unnumbered
11 paragraph underneath 26.1.3 to yourself please.

12 (Pause).

13° A. Yes.

14 Q. Are youable to agree with the points made in that

15 paragraph?

16 A. FromwhatI remember, yes.

17 Q. I'm grateful

18 Then the next unnumbered paragraph, Mr Parker says:
19 “If NBSC were unable to identify the cause of

20 a discrepancy they would often fall back ona default
21 statement along the lines of ‘this looks like a software
22 issue’ so that the SSC would investigate it. However,
23 Mr Roll's statement that "if an error was referred to us
24 then it was extremely unlikely to be due to a mistake
25 made bya postmaster’ is not correct. The vast majority

110

eIAHkYOnE

of discrepancies investigated by the SSC as pseudo
"software issues’ were (and are) not caused by software
issues”

I would like to suggest to you, Mr Roll, that that’s
true, isn’t it?

A. Theway that I remember it, it was issues to do with the
software that were causing the problems. Whether that
‘was the programme that had been written or data
corruption, that’s what I remember as our problems
being.

Q. You remember there being problems with data corruption?

A. Yes.

I'mnotasking you about data corruption, Mr Roll, I'm
asking you about software issues.
like to put to you again is the last sentence of that
paragraph:

‘The claim 1 would

“The vast majority of discrepancies investigated by
the SSC as pseudo ‘software issues” were (and are) not
caused by software issues ”

Are you in a position to agree to that?

A, From my recollection I would disagree with that, but it
was a long time ago.

Q. I'm grateful.

Paragraph 26.2 (E2/11/7}, there's then a description
of the second line support:

i

"Second line support was provided by senior members
of the HSD and SMC ..”

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Hold on, the page hadn't changed.

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: I'm so sorry, it is page 7.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: It is all right.

Weare at 26.2, yes? Or

It has now, it just
takes a little while
whichever one it is on page 7.

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Can I ask you to read paragraph 26.2
and its description of the second line of support.

AL Yes.

Q. Is that something that you can recall and can agree
with?

A. It’s not something I can definitely say yes or no to.
Your caution does you great credit, Mr Roll. What

I discern from you — and if I'm putting words in your
mouth do let me know -- you think it may well be right
but you don’t want to commit yourself --

AL Yes.

-- because it is a long time ago and you didn’t work in
second line?

AL Yes.

Q. That's very fair. But just to be clear, people who

worked in the second line included junior members of the

SSC team, yes?

A. Hm, That's not how1 remember it. Second line was

1 a separate entity and we were third line in the SSC.
2 Q. Well, I put his evidence to you and I will move on,
3 Then we come to the third line, 26.3. He says:
4 “The SSC also provided 3rd line support. The staff
5 that provided 3rd line supporthad a detailed knowledge
6 of the Horizon application based on documentation and
7 some inspection of source code. They:
8 “Designed, tested and documented work rounds for the
9 Ast and 2nd lines of support;
10 *[They] applied analytical skills to the symptoms
11 and evidence gathered by the 1st and 2nd line functions
12 and undertook in-depth investigation into incidents
13 (incidents are the basic unit of work for the support
14 team and come from help desk calls and other Horizon
15 support teams);
16 *[They] undertook complex configuration
17 (configuration items can be used to alter the behaviour
18 of the application) and data fixes which might have
19 required the generation of special tooling;
20 “[They] designed, wrote and documented new support
21 tools... [they] undertook source code examination,
22 complex diagnosis and documentation (including methods
23 to recreate faults) of new application problems before
24 sending them to the 4th line support group for root
25 cause software fix; and (they] provided technical
13
1 support to other internal Fujitsu teams working on
2 Horizon”
3 Now, have read an awful lot to you, Mr Roll, and
4 1 have done that on the apprehension that none of this
5 is going to be controversial. Can ask you to indicate
6 whether you accept what Mr Parker says there in
7 paragraph 26.3?
8 AL Yes.
9 Q I'mgrateful. Then there is a description of the PEAK
10 and KEL system which I need not trouble you with.
11 Paragraph 26.4 on page 8 {E2/11/8}, there's
12 a description of the fourth line
13 “ath line support staff had an intimate knowledge of
14 narrow areas of the system and were (and are) ultimately
15 responsible for the production of permanent fixes to
16 repair the root cause of an incident or problem in the
17 live application. They had knowledge of computer
18 languages which they used to amend source code to fix
19 problem in the live application code. There was often
20 overlap between 4th line and developers, who added new
21 features into the application ”
22 Dol apprehend, Mr Roll, that you agree with that as
23 well?
24 A. Broadly speaking, yes.
25 Q. I'm grateful

Now, you describe yourself in paragraph 2 of your

first statement (E1/7/1) as "third /fourth line support’

You in fact worked in third line support, didn’t you?

I worked in third line support, yes.

And it is fair to say that -- well, this is my language

and if you disagree with the nomenclature do let me

know, but would it be fair to say that third line

support was the elite, but the fourth line support, the

people that actually fixed software problems, they were

the super elite. Would thathe a fair thing to say?

1 would say there were some members of third line who

were super elite as well

And would you describe yourself as one of those people?

No.

Let’s talk about third line, The third line, they were

ona floor that even other Fujitsu staff members

couldn't generally access, is that right?

Yes.

And if we can pick it up at paragraph 28 of Mr Parker's

witness statement (E2/11/8}, you worked in third line

for between
“Between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2014...”
And those are the years that you worked for Fujitsu
".. the SSC received a total of 27,005 calls ,

well

meaning that on average $63 calls per month were dealt

115

with over this 4-year period”

And he refers to a spreadsheet setting that out and
he then analyses the data in that spreadsheet. Would
you accept that that is a fair reflection of the amount
of calls coming in, the amount of incidents coming in to
SSC when you were there, third line?
I can’t really remember. I know there were periods when
it was very busy and periods when it wasn't so busy.
Sometimes we had three or four jobs on the go at once,
other times we were given other work to do from the
manager.
And paragraph 29, Mr Parker says:

“Transferred calls (ie those not resolved by the
SSC) are of interest ”

He says:

“A very small proportion of calls transferred to
4th line support would have concerned software errors
requiring resolution

Stopping there, Mr Roll, that’s true, isn’t it?
Yes.
So he then says:

“.. it would be interesting [therefore] to know the
number of calls transferred to [fourth line }”

Would you agree to that? It would give some

indication of the extent to which incidents coming into

the SSC properly, genuinely represented software areas
that required fixing? That would bea useful way of
a touchstone of trying to work out

Yes.
Thank you

He then says that, unfortunately:

while the SSC have records of the volume of

transferred calls , we do not retain records of where

they are transferred to and it is not the case that all

of these would have been transferred to 4th line

support. For example incidents would often arrive at

SSC from internal teams for routing back to help desks.”
Do you remember that?

1 don’t remember that particular ..

But would it be right to say that of the calls coming

into third line support, a significant proportion would

go -- of calls that would then be transferred out, would

go to places other than fourth line support? Would that

be fair? Does that accord with your recollection?

The way recollect it is that calls would come in and

we would work on them, either fix them, in which case

they would go back to the originator, or we would pass

them on,

To other people?

To other people.

Depending on the nature of the problem?

17

Yes
So if there was an infrastructure problem you would
probably pass the call on to the infrastructure team, it
wouldn't go to fourth line support, would it?

Probably.

And there are a number of other teams that calls coming
into third line would be passed to who would not be
fourth line support?

Probably.

I accept, it’s a long time ago

I can’t remember the full details .
If we could just look
at an analysis that Mr Parker has done of calls coming
in and calls coming out, could we go to (F/1839} please.
This is a series of spreadsheets which I have -- I'm
probably the least qualified person in court to be
talking about spreadsheets and I would like to go to the
tab which is “Live PEAKs into SSC” please, at the bottom
“RRP live PEAKs into SSC”, there

of the page. And you

will see that there is a calculation of from 2002 oh,
from 2002 all the way through to 2004-- actually, I'm
sorry, if you go up to the top of the page you will see
there is more. But it’s from January 2001 all the way
through to December 2004 and you will see at the bottom
there’s a figure of 27,005 calls. Mr Parker's evidence
is that’s the number of incidents/calls that came into

the third line support during the years that you were

there. Are you in a position to dispute that?
I would say that’s probably the number of recorded calls
that came in, yes.

I'm grateful. If we could go to the next tab, which is
“RRP live PEAKs out of SSC", here is the calculation ,
again from January 2001 all the way through

to December 2004, of the total number of calls that were

passed out of third line support and we have already
established that a proportion of those calls would have
gone elsewhere?
Mm-hm.
Some of them would have gone to fourth line support and
I believe you have already accepted that a small
proportion of those going to fourth line support would
have gone to fourth line support because they required
software fixes?
Yes.
Very good.

Now, the total figure that Mr Parker has analysed
comes to 3,764 calls. Do you see that?
Yes.
‘Are you in a position to dispute that calculation?
I can’t dispute that, no.
No. AndI didn’t expect you to.

So what that means is that of the calls coming into

119

third line support while you were there, 14% of them
went elsewhere and of that 14% only a subset would have
gone to fourth line support.
Yes.

Do you accept that?

And of that subset only a small subset would have
represented calls relating to software errors requiring
fixing by fourth line support. Do you accept that?
Does this figure, 3,764

figure earlier on, is that calls that have come in, gone

is that -- and the other
out then come back to us and gone out again somewhere
else, or is it just ones that have come in, gone all
round the houses, as it were, and then gone out for
final resolution?
My understanding is it is the latter but I had better
check. Yes, Mr Parker is nodding. Are you in
a position to challenge that?
No.
Very good.

So what that indicates then is summarised by
Mr Parker in paragraph 32 on page (E2/11/9} and
Mr Parker says:

“From the SSC, only a tiny proportion of incidents
were escalated to the 4th line support team. It follows
that only a tiny fraction of incidents raised actually

needed to be looked at by the only team who might

15 Q Yes, Mr Roll. We could by all means go back to the 15 some of the junior level hada very in-depth knowledge
16 graphs because you will have seen from the live PEAKs 16 of the accounting side of things, so certain aspects
17 into and out of the SSC it actually gave monthly 17 would be passed over to them. A couple were very, very
18 figures, but what I’m suggesting to you, Mr Roll, is 18 clued up on UNIX and that side of things so the actual
19 that -- although you may well have been busy on all 19 servers, any problems with those, if it was involved
20 sorts of things, the fact of the matter is that software 20 problems would go over to them. So that was where their
21 problems requiring a software fix represented a tiny 21 knowledge lay in specific areas, very in-depth very
22 fraction of the work that was handled by the SSC third 22 specific knowledge of those particular areas. Does that

Day 3

1 1 moved to Fujitsu so there were areas of knowledge we
2 had from previous areas, but I suppose most of it would
3 then be passed on to those people
4 Q. Isee. So would you accept from me then that generally
5 it would be them that would look at lots of code but
6 occasionally there might be occasions when someone else
7 would look at lots of code?
8 A. Froma PINICL perspective yes, but some of us looked at
9 code more often, just out of interest.
10 Q. Well, 1 will ask you about that in a while.
aL Now, the last thing I’m going to be doing in this
12 cross-examination is suggesting that you didn’t have
13 a responsible position anda responsible job. You were
14 well trained, weren't you?

15 A. I waswell trained by Fujitsu, yes.

16 Q Is it the case that there was.a mandatory six month

17 training process you had to go through at Fujitsu before
18 you were allowed unsupervised access to the live system?
19 A. I don't fully recall that

20 Q. Andwouldit also be fair to say that the work that you

21 did involved tasks that were much easier and were much
22 more mundane --Idon’t mean tobe insulting -- than the
23 kind of tasks that the senior people within the third
24 line of support did?

25 A. I think one of the comments Mr Parker made in his

125

1 statement at some point was that some things stick in

2 the mind more than others and over time one tends to

3 forget the mundane aspects of the job and tends to

4 remember more the aspects that were not mundane, so my

5 recollection is that -- as I put in my statement

6 I spent sort of 70% of the time doing not mundane tasks,

7 as it were, and only 30%, but that could be wrong, it

8 could be my perception of events from 15/17 years ago.

9 Q. That's very fair, Mr Roll, and I’m grateful for that
10 Can we look at some PEAKs which indicate the kind of
it work that you were doing and I’m not suggesting, by the
12 way, that these PEAKs are representative of all the work
13 that you did. But if wecan go to {F/94.1} please.
14 That's a PEAK that’s dated 26 March 2001 soit is quite
15 early on in your tenure at the SSC. Could I ask you
16 just to -- well, let’s -- it’s halfway down the first
17 box we've got “Information: long calls detected on
18 Bootle ISDN66” and then there is a series of times
19 relating to particular branches, particular FADs. Are
20 you able to explain what that’s about? What that
21 problem was?

22 A. I think from what! remember calls were only supposed to

23 last a certain time. If they lasted more than so many
24 minutes then it would flag up an error. I think that’s
25 what that says but that’s

126

eIAHkYOnE

I see, and then you will see several boxes down under
the heading “Graham Critchley”, do you see that?

Yes

And then the next box down:

*F response: lines checked, no longer up. All long

And then there is a reference to a KEL.

Can you describe what you were doing in relation to
this?

No, I can't remember.
You can't remember.

‘Then you would have been -- it would have been your
final response. The fact that your nameis at the
bottom indicates that you are the final responder for
this PEAK, yes?

Yes.

And generally speaking would it be right to say that the
final responder is the person who has ownership of the
conclusion of the process?

Yes.

And the resolution and usually knows more about the
problem than anybody else, would that be fair?

Not necessarily knows more about the problem, no, but
would have ownership of the problem.

And its resolution?

127

Yes.

And if we could move on to {F/164.01} please. This is
a PEAK
years into your tenure. It is dated 28 November 2003

it is now acouple of years, perhaps three

and at the top on the first box we've got at 15/10/03,
11.17 and then there is a long acronym. Could you tell
the court what OBC stands for?
I don't remember.
“Engineer to site 21/11/03 am to remove 2 counters and
pin pads from site and return to Triage Services.
Engineer to ensure EOD marker is received prior to
decommissioning”

So an engineer is going into a branch to remove some
counters.
Looks like the branch has closed
It looks like the branch is closing

Then if we go to the next box we've got
Barbara Longley -- who was Barbara Longley, do you
remember her?
I think she was the lady who was the administrative
person responsible for allocating calls
And then several lines down, "the call summary is now”
and there is a FAD number “check for marooned
transactions". Could you explain what the marooned
transactions are?

Day 3

1A. [can’t really remember but I think you had an end of

2 date marker and if anything had been -- any transactions

3 that were done after the last end of day marker so if

4 the branch had closed say at lunchtime, anything done in

5 the morning there wouldn't have been an end of data

6 marker left so I believe they may not have been

7 harvested properly and I think that was

8 Q. Well, can I suggest to you that what's happening here is

9 that there’s a basic kit removal operation and marooned
10 transactions are transactions that might be located on
11 the machines but are trapped in -- they are stuck in the
12 machines, possibly because of a hardware error. Would
13 that be right?

14 A. Possibly.

15 Q Isee. And you will see halfway down the same box:

16 *Pre-scan: assigning call to Richard Roll in EDSC”
17 Do you remember what EDSC stands for?

18 A. No, I don't

19 Q. Bur it is assigned to you and then if we go to the next

20 box down your response is:
21 “There are no marooned transactions; EODs and cash
22 accounts harvested okay.”

23 So what work would you have done there to result in
24 that report?

25 A. I don't know.

129
1 Q. Youcan’t recall?
2 A. I don't remember.
3 Q Ise. Well, let's try the next one {F/193.1} please.
4 This is dated 26 February 2004. This is the year you
5 left and the first big box with big text in, another OBC
6 exercise of some sort, "planned short notice close”, so
7 it looks as if a branch is closing down:
8 “ROMEC Engineer to site 18/02/2004 AM to remove 1
9 counter and pin pad from site and return to triage
10 Services. Engineer to ensure EOD marker is received
11 prior to decommissioning”
12 So an engineer is going to a branch to close it down
13 and remove the equipment, so similar to what we saw
14 before.
15 And then the next box down, about a third of the way
16 down there's a line which reads:
17 “Attended site [18 February]. SMC John confirmed.
18 Synchronisation ..._ ROMEC work complete”
19 Who were ROMEC, do you remember?
20 A. No.
21 Q Andtwolines down:
22 “Information: please check for last CA and potential
23 marooned transactions.”
24 Do you know what “last CA” means?

25 A. Last cash account I think,

130

eIAHkYOnE

And potential marooned transactions, again is someone
seeking to check whether there were any transactions
stuck ona machine that haven't been harvested and sent
elsewhere, is that right?
Yes.
And then if we go down the page to the bottom of the
page, right at the bottom it is assigned to you, so you
are still doing this kind of work amongst many other
kinds of work
Yes.
~ in 2004 and over the page (F/193.1/2} about halfway
down, 19 February at 11.8, user Richard Roll
“Final cash account harvested correctly, there are
no marooned transactions. No further action required.”
Now, is it fair to say that a significant portion of
your work did involve supporting engineers doing that
kind of work? Would that be right?
I can’t remember what percentage was what. It would
have varied over time. Certainly for the last year
after I had handed my notice in, I’ mnot -- I can’t
remember if there was.a change in my workload or not.
Well, let's go to your second witness statement that you
made in January of this year. It is at {1/10}. You
have already alluded to it. I would like to go to

page 8 (E1/10/8} which is paragraph 25. Perhaps you

131

could just read it quietly to yourself.
(Pause).

Yes.

Abouta third of the way down you say:

“However, if it is helpful to the court for meto at
least clarify my role, then I would add the following
short points: 1, whilst my workload did involve some
support to engineers opening and closing branches,

1 would estimate that this made up only 30% of my work,
and the majority of my workload (estimate 70%) involved
looking for faults on data stores, preparing reports for
the manager asa result of reports of problems with
Horizon experienced by the estate."
‘And then you say

“as part of this role, at least some of the time
I was involved in examining source code

Yes,

Now, first of all, when you say “looking for faults on
data stores”, what do you mean? Would that include
looking for marooned transactions on counters, on the
message stores?

It could do, yes

I see. And would it include checking to see whether
message - whether counters, whether the machines are
locked when they should be unlocked, that kind of,

Day 3

1 looking for problems in the configuration data for
2 example in machines which prevent them from working
3 properly? Would you include that as looking for faults
4 on data stores? Because it does seem to be what those
5 words mean, Mr Roll?
6 A. I find —- I can’t remember any specific details of that
7 sort of depth of work that I did. WhatI believe was
8 that I said most of my work was of a more technical
9 nature, not supporting the engineers, but that’s my
10 recollection and that’s the best I can give you.
11 Q Faults in data or data stores, that doesn’t mean looking
12 for bugs in software, does it?
13 A. It’s not technically looking for a bugin the code, more

14 a bugin the data, a corruption in the data

15 Q. Yes. So that’s a very useful distinction actually .
16 A difference between errors in code, bugs in -- what
17 layman would probably call bugs and then data
18 corruption?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And data corruption is a vast sort of panoply of
21 problems. It could include configuration problems, you
22 could have data which has some fields that are missing,
23 you could have machines that are locked because they've
24 got the wrong binary setting -. I’m not putting this
25 very technically, I hope you will forgive me. It would
133
1 will include a vast array of problems, many of which
2 would be hardware related, would that be right?
3. A. No, not necessarily. Thedata ... it could -- it’s not
4 necessarily the hardware that’s corrupted it. The data
5 becomes corrupt. Data is not hardware or software, it’s
6 the data
7 Q Yes, when II say “many of which could be hardware
8 related” I’m actually trying to put that very point to
9 you, Mr Roll, which is that if you havea data
10 corruption, it maybe the result of a software bug
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. - but it maywellbe the result of something completely
13 different , there are a wide array of things, including
14 hardware issues, would you accept that?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. So when you describe 70 per cent of your work as
17 including looking for faults on data stores, you are not
18 saying, are you, that that work was looking for software
19 bugs? That's not what you mean?
20 A. Not 70% of it, no.
21 Q. I’mgrateful. And then you say:
22 *... preparing reports for the manager asa result
23 of reports of problems with Horizon experienced by the
24 estate
25 First of all, whois the manager in that sentence?

Mik Peach.
I see. So whatyou were doing, he would appoint you to
provide him with reports, would he?

He did, yes.

And those reports -- he would do that because he himself
had received reports of one kind or another, is that
right?

He -- Mik Peach was engaged to another lady who worked
in Fujitsu who was ofa similar or maybe senior level to
him and she occasionally asked him for favours and he
would ask me to write reports and generate reports to
give to her.

You describe them as being “as a result of reports of
problems with Horizon experienced by the estate". What
are these reports of problems with Horizon experienced
by the estate?

I don't remember the details.

Are we talking about standard routine reports that are
generated automatically?

No.

So we're talking about specific reports, what, by human
beings?

Specific reports where I would look at the various
reports that had already been generated, collate the

data and extract specific data for him.

135

I see. So there were people producing reports and then
Mr Peach would then ask you to do reports collating the
information that wasin those underlying reports; is
that what you are describing?

Some of the reports were systems generated, some were
generated by other people.

And systems generated - 1 would like to investigate
that a little bit. This also applies to the looking for
faults on data stores that you describe. A lot of the
work you did in looking for faults on data stores was
related to system reports that -- there are a series,
avast series actually, of reports that are
automatically generated by the systemas to its own
performance just to make sure it is working, lots and
lots of automated reports, and when you were looking for
faults on data stores you would be using those reports

to look for problems which you would then be looking to

see whether you could see if there wasa problem and if
so what should be done about it?

Okay. Some of the reports were looking for
communications problems, so long calls. Others would be
looking for errors in the data stores. The data store
was harvested every day and the information would then
be processed overnight, so there would be all the

banking transactions from all the counters would be

1 extracted and batched up and then sent off to different
2 banks and every process along there would generate
3 a report as well. So it wasn't just the data stores, it
4 ‘was the whole system was generating reports.
5 Q. There were an enormous
6 A. Wewould have access to all those reports, sorry.
7 Q Imsorry, I didn’t hear you that last -- that’s my
8 fault, 1 talked over you and now I'm saying I can’t hear
9 you. I’msorry, Mr Roll.
10 Yes, I see.
at So you would agree with me, would you, that there
12 were a large number of automatic reports that were
13 continually produced by the Horizon system
14 A. Yes
15  Q -- to monitor its performance and to look for problems?
16 A. Yes
17 Q And that when those reports generated some hits when
18 potential problems were identified, then people at your
19 level would go and look at them to see whether there was
20 anything that needed to be done about them?
21 A. Yes. As time progressed we wrote more and more reports
22 ourselves -- or programmes ourselves to monitor the
23 system, to alert us to any potential problems.
24 Q. And then perhaps I could ask you to go back to
25 Mr Parker's statement, (£2/11/9}. If I could pick it up
137,
1 at paragraph 34. Mr Parker says:
2 “As noted above, the SSC team provided both 2nd and
3 3rd line support. As with any mix of people, there are
4 {and were) various levels of talent within SSC. Mr Roll
5 was primarily used in operational business change (OBC),
6 which involved supporting the engineers who were opening
7 and closing branches and increasing and decreasing the
8 number of counters in branches.”
9 Stopping there, does that remind you as to what OBC
10 stands for?
11. A. It does, now.
12 Q. And would you agree that you were primarily involved in
13 that activity?
14 =A. That’s not howI remember it, no.
15 Q. Could suggest to you that it is quite possible that
16 because of the process you yourself described a few
17 minutes ago, that one tends to remember only the more
18 interesting things
19 A. It is, it is possible
20 Q. - it is actually possible that that did represent your
21 primary set of jobs?
22 A. Yes, it could be.
23° Q. I'mgrateful. He says
24 “Mr Roll would also have been regularly correcting
25 the application environment after engineers had replaced

failed counter hardware and clearing temporary files to
increase disc space”
Is thar true?

A. It’s possible
“This could fairly be described as 2nd line work and it
was done by the SSC because it required a higher level
of access to the system than other support teams had.”

1 don't remember it, but it’s possible

Would you accept that?
A. It could be considered that.
Q. And then paragraph 35:

*Some members of the 3rd line support group
identified the need for software fixes via source code
examination and would pass this on to the 4th line team
for a code fix to be written. MrRoll did not play any
significant part in this and was not involved in any
extensive source code examination. An application code
fix would not be written by anyone in the 3rd line team
and he was not involved in the provision of 4th line
support”

Could I suggest to you, Mr Roll, that you did not
play any significant part -- I'm not saying you played
no part, but you did not play a significant part in that
process and you weren't generally involved in extensive
source code examination?

A. That is correct, not generally involved, but I was

139

involved in some source code examination.

Q. Onoceasion?

A. On occasion.
And then would you agree that an application code fix,
that’s a software fix to correct whatI would call
‘a bug, would not be written by anyone in the 3rd line
team; that's right, isn’t it?

A. Yes, we would identify a problem but the software
development team would write it

Q. It’s the fourth line people that fix them and! think
you would agree thar from Mr Parker says here is that
you were not involved in the provision of fourth line
support.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Is that right?

A. Fourth line support, from that way

The way I was looking at fourth line

1 suppose yes, you
could say that
support was writing code that would monitor the systems
and generate errors -- generate alerts if there was
a potential error, so from the way that’s put then yes,
you could say that.
MR DE GARR ROBINSON: You weren't involved in the support
that was provided by the fourth line?
A. No
Q. Thank you.
So would it be fair to say that the reading of

copious amounts of code was relatively rare for the
third line of supportand whenit did happen it was
generally done by the senior people that we have
discussed?

A. Yes, I would think so.

Q. And although you did it on occasion, it was even rarer

for you; would that be
A. Yes.
Q. I'm grateful

Then if we move on to paragraph 37 {E2/11/10}
Perhaps I could ask you to read paragraph 37.
A. Sorry, read out loud or .2
Q. No, no, just read it to yourself
(Pause).
Subject to one point which I’m about to raise with

I'mso sorry.

you, Mr Parker says here:

“Moreover, Mr Roll was not working at a level where
he would be required to review code.”

Mr Roll, I’m not suggesting that you never reviewed
code, sometimes you did, but subject to those occasional
times would you accept what Mr Parker says in
paragraph 372

A. It’s again what we said earlier. My recollection is
different to this but it’s possible that predominantly

I did do the workaround. It’s a long time ago.

41

MR JUSTICE FRASER: What about the sentences that say about
the role of the SSC, do you agree with them? The SSC
had access to view, but couldn't amend, source code?

A. Yes, I agree with that.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: That's correct.

then described in the second sentence was rarely used,

And the access which is

or do you not know?

‘A. I looked at the source code on several occasions, but
over a four year period that is rarely used, so ..

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Okay.

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Well then, Mr Roll, if I could ask you
to go back to your first witness statement, it is E1,
tab 7. If wecould pick it up at paragraph 6 {E1/7/1}

you say:

“My role involved receiving issues or problems being
experienced by people working within Post Office
branches. In many cases, this involved me dealing
directly with subpostmasters and others employed in
Post Office branches”

And then in. paragraph 7 you say:

“By way of example of the type of issue that I would
deal with, if a financial discrepancy had arisen in
shortfall " of £5,000) then I would need
to work sequentially through all transactions over the

a branch (eg a

relevant period and also work through thousands of lines

142

eIAHkYOnE

of computer coding. Software programmes were written by
us to strip out irrelevant data to enable us to more
easily locate the error.”

Given the discussion we have just been having,
Mr Roll, would you accept that perhaps with the benefit
of hindsight paragraph 7 might give a slightly
misleading impression, I’m sure unintentionally. It
gives, I would suggest, the impression that this is
something you did regularly, that when dealing with
problems arising in branches you would regularly work
through thousands of lines of computer coding, but
that’s not actually the case, is it?
That is not the ease, no, and that is
that is what that suggests.
That's fair. That wasn’t your intention to suggest that
Is that

1 must agree

and it may beI’m reading too much into it.
what you are saying?

My recollection was that I did work through computer
coding of the programmes, but now I'm not so sure.
I'mvery grateful, Mr Roll.

‘Then if we could go back to (E2/11}, Mr Parker's
statement. If we could pick it up at page 10
{E2/11/10}, in paragraph 39 Mr Parker describes how:

“When an incident is resolved, the SSC team member

(or technician as they are sometimes called) types

143

a summary of the incident (known asa final response)
and allocates a response code to the incident in order
to classify it.”

Pausing there, do you remember that that was how the
SSC worked?

No, I don’t remember that.

You do remember the fact that someone would be
responsible for producing the final response on any
PEAK, yes?

Yes.

And do you remember that that person would allocate

a code to the PEAK reflecting his or her judgment as to
the nature of the problem that had been dealt with?

I know that that’s what happened because I have seen the
documents here, but I don’t remember that.

Oh, well, it might be that the questions I was about to
ask you could go quicker but I will try anyway.

“While guidance is provided on when to use each
response code .. allocation is the subjective view of
the technician closing the incident and there is no
re-examination of the response codes later to ensure
consistency ”

Would I be right in thinking that you are not really
in a position to commentat this remove of time?

No.

column C is the overall count of total number of PEAKs

wyAnRone

with these particular codes and you will see it comes to
9 27,002 and I should -- it is worth mentioning, my Lord,

10 Mr Parker says there are 27,005. This says 27,002,

11 there are three missing, I’m afraid I’m not in

12 a position to tell anyone why.

13. MRJUSTICE FRASER: They might be in cell C2 which has been

14 deleted. It might not count.
15 Can we just click on cell 34C-- I meanit is not
16 a big point so it is not worth .. no, sometimes it
17 shows the formula.
18 All right, it doesn’t matter.
19 MR DE GARR ROBINSON: I'm afraid it was posited only
20 a couple of hours ago and I'mnot in a position to
21 MR JUSTICE FRASER: I don’t think the difference between
22 27,002 and 27,005 is going to make any difference.
23 MR DE GARR ROBINSON: I don’t either.
24 So you will see, Mr Roll, just to explain it,
25 there's the overall analysis of the codes, the
149
1 distribution of the PEAKs between these different codes
2 and then there is a -- if yougo -- youcan skip D for
3 the moment, butE, F, G, H, I, J and, these are sort
4 of broader categories which are intended to encompass
5 different groups of code, so Mr Parker has chosen
6 “Potential software error” then "Potential user error”,
7 “Hardware”, "Admin", "Known isstte/work round”,
8 “Reconciliation” and "Documentation", do you see those
9 broad categories?
10 =A. Yes.
11 = Q. Just to explain how it works - it is not nearly as
12 complicated as it looks. If you look at "Potential
13 software error” you go down and you see there is a 1 on
14 row 12. That corresponds to closure category 59:
15 "Ref data fix available to call logger”
16 That's the official code, or rather a brief summary
17 of code 59 and it shows that there are some hits in that
18 code category during the four years that you are there.
19 Do you understand how it works?
20 A. Yes.

21 Q Thennext one down, another potential software error is
22 60:

23 “Software fix available to call logger”

24 And the third one down is 61 "Build fix available to

25 call logger”. Do these phrases, "Reference data fix

available to call logger”, “Software fix available to
call logger*, "Build fix available to call logger”, do
those terms ring any bells?
No,

Or is it really just to
time trying to -

I'm afraid I can’t remember any of those.

‘would I be wasting valuable

‘That's fair andI won't -- and then just to complete the
picture, row 24 there's a code 74 which is also treated
as a potential software error and this is "Fixed at
future release” but given what you have just said
perhaps will leave it at the fact that you are not in
a position to challenge these categorisations, are you?
No.

And then we've got "Known issue/workround” in column
The first one, the first hit is at 64, “publish known
error’, that sounds quite logical, so if there’s a known
error log already in existence that’s just taking it and
saying "This is the KEL that applies to this problem’.
And the next one down is "Unpublished known error” and
the next one downis "Solicited known error” and the
next one down is “Avoidance action supplied". Again,
would I be right in thinking it is probably not

a valuable use of time to ask you about those

categories?

151

No.
Okay. Well, this is Mr Parker's categorisation and you
will see that he distinguishes between potential
software error and known issue/work-arounds and if we go
down to the bottom of the table, looking at the overall
figures of the 27,002, we have 2,252 which are treated
as potential software errors, that’s 8.3% andI think we
have already discussed that figure and I believe you
said you are not in a position to dispute that
calculation, is that right?
That's correct
And then if we go over to "Known issue/work round” there
are 9,545 of those which represents 35%, 35.3% of the
work being undertaken by the SSC while you were there.
Again, would I be right in thinking you are not in
a position to dispute that?
Yes.
Thank you.

Now, staying with this document I would like to go
to a different tab please. Could we goto the
“Final responses” tab. Now, this, Mr Roll, is an
analysis of the PEAKs for which you were the final
responder.
Right.
And you will recall that this is addressed in

1 Mr Parker's witness statement. You will see that there 1 demanding that you accept them
2 are 915 PEAKs in which you are the final responder while 2 A I~ yes.
3 you were there in your 44 months when you were at 3 Q. If these figures are right, these just represent the
4 Fujitsu and there's a breakdown of which particular 4 PEAKs in relation to which you were the final responder,
5 categories you had applied to the relevant PEAKs when 5 you were the one who had ownership ~- if I can use that
6 you closed them. 6 horrible cliche -- of the resolution of the problem and
7 A. Right. 7 the closure of the PEAK. It’s true that you would have

10 you will see that as well as an overall analysis of the 10 to someone else and so on, it would have passed through
11 work done by the SSC there’s also an analysis of the 11 your hands, but wouldn't it be right to say that the
12 would, that you did, "RR", this is in the pale -- is it 12 PEAKs where the music stopped -- the PEAKs that landed
13 beige? When Iwasa child I think I would have called 13 in your lap as the final responder would be a fair
14 it fawn but we have to say beige now. There is a beige 14 a representative reflection of the nature of the work
15 line and it has your 915 PEAKs and you will see 15 that you did as between different categories of work?
16 “Potential software error”, the total for the SSC is 16 A. Yes, I should think so. There were probably some that
17 8.3% but do you see that your total comes out at 3.2%? 17 I got to start with that I then passed on to, as you

25 Q. And if we go along to "Known issue/work round”, whichis = 25 please. Do you see there from row 21 downwards on the
153 155
1 column, as I say we have 35.3% for the SSC but we've 1 left -hand side the category is given but for some reason

more about those codes, it is actually -- I was going to
take Mr Roll to them but given his --

MR JUSTICE FRASER: I imagined you probably would. 1 was
just curious about that column but it doesn’t matter,
please don't interrupt your flow.

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: I will take instructions overnight.

I'mso sorry to keep you waiting.

MRJUSTICE FRASER: It is my fault for interrupting

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: So, Mr Roll, with that analysis can we
go back to your first statement please. It is (E1/7/2}.
It is paragraph 11 that I’minterested in. You say:

“1 would estimate that there were over 30
individuals working on the same floor as me ... in the
Fujitsu building at Bracknell. My recollection is that
many of those individuals were involved in similar work
to myself, or were involved in other Horizon related IT
work. I would describe much of the work being carried
out as ‘fire - fighting * coding problems in the Horizon
system.”

For “coding problems” I take it you're talking about
software bugs. Onthe basis of the analysis of the
evidence that we have just been through at slightly
painful length, would you accept that it is possible
that you may have rather exaggerated the position, no

doubt unintentionally, in the last sentence of

187

paragraph 11?

A. Certainly the wayI remember it doesn’t agree with the
figures, so yes, it is possible that

Q. Much of your work was not fire- fighting coding problems
at all, was it, coding problems represented a tiny
amount of your work?

‘A. On the evidence you have just supplied, that’s correct.
Q. Nor did it occupy much of your colleagues’ work either,
if welook at the overall figures, 8.3% for software

errors, would you accept that? Even that -- it would be
unfair to describe the process that was undertaken
during that four-year period as fire fighting coding
errors by the SSC. It’s just not accurate, is it,
Mr Roll?

A. From volume perhaps not. Time-wise avoidance action
would obviously take much less time than trying to find
a software problem. But the figures certainly
contradict my recollections of it

Q. That's fair

If we could move back to paragraph 9 (E1/7/2} you
say:

“We regularly identified issues with the computer
coding in the Horizon system. We would then flag those
issues to the Fujitsu IT software developers.”

Mr Roll, you didn’t regularly identify issues with

158

computer coding that would be flagged for the fourth

line support, did you? That's just not consistent with

the figures we have been looking at?

A. The way I remembered it was that we were as a department
finding issues every week but I’m notsure if that is
the case now. That was my recollection

Q. I’m grateful. ‘Then paragraph 8-- this may have been

carefully drafted, or it may actually have been

carelessly drafted and I’m not attributing any motives
to you, I’m genuinely not, but if you look at the last
sentence of paragraph 8, you say:

“If an error was referred to us then it was
extremely unlikely to be due to a mistake made by
a postmaster; the vast majority of errors 1 dealt with
were due to coding errors or data corruption.”

Just to be clear, Mr Roll, you are not saying that
the vast majority of errors you dealt with were coding
errors, are you?

No.

>

Q. And when you say “or data corruption”, that includes all
sorts of problems
All sorts of problems ~
that had nothing to do with software bugs?
Yes.

oPrPoPr

I'm grateful. Now, I would like to ask you about

159

paragraph 10 of your witness statement (E1/7/2}.

I'msorry, Mr Roll, I'm told that the transcriber
hasn't got the last answer. Could I read my question
again and then you can answer it again. I think it may
be my fault for having talked over you. My question
was: and when you say “or data corruption” that includes
all sorts of problems that have nothing to do with
software bugs?

A. Yes.

I'm very grateful
Then paragraph 10 on page 2 {E1/7/2} of your witness
statement:

"My recollection is that the software issues we were
routinely encountering ..”
Do you think there’s a danger that by describing

yourself as “routinely encountering” software errors,
you may have unintentionally exaggerated the position?

A. I'mreferencing here the whole department, not myself
and it was my recollection that as a department we were
routinely encountering software errors, which, as we
have previously said, the figures don’t support that but
that was my recollection.

Q. That's very fair, MrRoll, thank you.

You say:

"My recollection is that the software issues we were

4 I think you will accept, won't you, that software
5 issues did not routinely cause branch discrepancies?
6 You are not saying that, are you?
7A. By “software” there I mean software and data issues,
8 corruption, et cetera

12 would it be fair to say that whenever you refer to
13 “software issues” we should probably read in the
14 possibility of other data issues that aren't concerned
15 with software bugs?
16 A. Yes
17° Q I'm grateful
18 MR JUSTICE FRASER: By “software bugs" I think
19 Mr De Garr Robinson is talking about code issues.
20 A. Yes.
21 MRJUSTICE FRASER: That's how you are putting it. You are
22 using in your statement, as far as I can tell,
23 “software” in a rather more generic way, is that
24 correct?
25 A. I'matraid so, yes. I should have - it has beena long

9 MR DE GARR ROBINSON: -- bears no necessary relation to

it points. Just so that you, MrRoll, if you could specify

12 in any of your answers when you are referring to coding
13 using the word "code" then I will understand and

14 Mr De Garr Robinson will understand what your answer
15 relates to.

16 A. Yes, my Lord.

17 ~~ MRJUSTICE FRASER: All right.

18 MR DEGARR ROBINSON: So back to paragraph 10, I think you
19 have -- I hope I’m not putting words into your mouth.

Coding issues. You are not saying that even the whole
group of you, not just you, routinely encountered issues
of that sort? You're not saying that, are you?

We would --a call would come into us with an error in
the accounts or something like that basically. We would
then look for a cause, And so unfortunately my
terminology -- it has beena long time since I was in
the industry. So it could be the code or it could be
the data corruption and we would have to try and find
out which one it was.

So you are not saying that you were routinely
encountering coding issues, are you?

Bugs, no.

I'm grateful. And then you said these issues could and
did cause financial discrepancies at branch level ,
“these issues” being both software issues and data

Data,

-- more generally data issues. You are not
suggesting -- actually let me break it down so we can be
completely clear about what we're talking about. You've
got -- it is not a venn diagram, in fact it is the
opposite of a venn diagram, We've got a category of
whatI would call -- let's call them coding issues so we
know exactly what we're talking about, and then we have

a category of data issues. Would! be right in thinking

163

that the data issues that you encountered were far more
frequent than the coding issues, the coding issues
actually were quite rare?

We would always encounter data issues. Those data
issues could be caused by a coding issue, or they could
be caused by something else and I would say they were
usually caused by something else.

I'm grateful. So data issues that were the result of
coding issues represented a very small proportion of the
total world of data issues, yes?

Yes.

I'm grateful. And then of that -- we then look at data
issues and we have data issues that result in
discrepancies at branch level

Yes.

Would Ibe right in thinking that the number of data
issues that cause discrepancies at branch level were
very small compared with the total number of data issues
with which you were wrestling?

My recollection is that the data issues we were dealing
with were generally -- that it was quite a high
percentage of

1 example you could have a configuration problem which
2 means the machine isn’t working properly. ‘That's a data
3 issue, isn’t it?
4A. Yes, yes.
5 Q. That would bea problem at the branch but it wouldn't be
6 a problem that would cause a discrepancy, would it?
7A. So what! meanis from what I remember, alot of the
8 data issues that came in, we got them because there was
9 a problem with the accounts, a balance mismatch.
10 somewhere. This is how] remember it. And if we could
11 find a problem-- if you could pinpoint it to the data
12 itself then you could perhaps find the problem and fix
13 it. If youcouldn’t find where the problem was in the
14 data, or you couldn't understand why it had happened
15 then there was the potential for it to bea software
16 problem, so then you would pass it over. It didn’t mean
17 there was a software problem, it meant there was
18 a potential for it.
19 Q. Well, I'm grateful for that and actually I think you may
20 have just agreed with what I'm about to put to you.
21 Could I ask you to go to Mr Parker's first statement
22 please. It is at {E2/11/11). This is where Mr Parker
23 says this:
24 "Classifying an incident as a ’ potential’ software
25 error does not necessarily mean that there was
165
1 a software error ..”
2 I believe that’s the point you just made to me,
3 isn’t it?
4A. Mmhm.
5 Q “and, even if there was, it does not mean that the
6 error was one that could have caused a financial impact
7 in a branch's accounts ..”
8 Would you agree with that?
9 AL Yes.
10 Q. Andthen he says in brackets
11 *.. (a large proportion of these would be errors in
12 numerous data centre resident systems that the
13 subpostmaster never sees - errors were often as_ trivial
14 as the use of "Kg’ instead of *kg’ on receipts ).”
15 Would you agree with that?
16 A. [can't remember.
17 Q. Well, I do suggest to you, Mr Roll, that even when you
18 had a coding error that created a data problem in
19 a branch, the number of data errors that actually
20 created a branch shortfall was a vanishingly small
2 proportion?
22 A. My recollection is that it wasa big part of our job, so
23 for me working there it didn’t seem like a small
24 proportion, a vanishingly small proportion. Also
25 just -- if there wasa potential software issue and we

passed it over for investigation, if they couldn't find
a problem it didn’t necessarily mean there wasn't

a problem, it just meant they couldn't find it. $0.
I can’t agree fully with what you have just said

Well, let me continue with what Mr Parker says:

“As stated in paragraph 16 above, such errors were
extremely rare”

‘That's coding errors which caused a financial impact
on branch accounts. As a proportion of the work coming
into the SSC, coding errors causing financial impact on
branch accounts was extremely rare, would you agree?

Yes.

Thank you. And you say that problems would come in
because there were discrepancies in branch accounts and
that’s how you would often see a problem, but of course
there’s a large number of possible causes,

Yes.

-- for those problems, including user error, would you
agree?

Yes.

‘And would you agree that a significant proportion,

a large proportion of even the problems that got through
to the SSC, to third line, they were due-- probably due
to user error?

My recollection is that maybe 50% ~ I'm trying to

167

remember now. [can’t remember it fully. But my
recollection is that it wasa pretty balanced mixas to
cither user error or maybe data corruption,

So let_mesee if I understand your answer, So what you
are suggesting is of the problems that came in that were
concerned with branch account discrepancies, you say

your recollection is 50% you would have put down to user
error?
Yes, I’m-- I’mtrying to just think of it now and maybe

50% wasuser error. Certainly -- 1 wouldn't have liked
to have said that the majority, or a vast majority was
user error, but it is possible

Then let's move on to paragraph 42:

"Mr Roll’s suggestion in paragraph 10 that software
issues in Horizon ‘routinely’ caused discrepancies in
branch accounts is misleading. In the vast majority of
cases such an occurrence would cause a receipts and
payments ... mismatch that would be flagged by the
branch system as part of the balancing process

Is that right?

I think -- I'm

‘There were instances -- no, I can't

not sure. I think that’s right
“In the vast majority of cases such an occurrence would
cause a receipts and payments .. mismatch that would be

1 That's true, isn’t it?
2 A. In the vast majority, yes.
3 Q. Then he adds:
4 "... (the Horizon system carries out
5 self -consistency checks which generate alerts in the
6 event of a receipts and payments mismatch that are
7 picked up by SMC and incidents raised for the SSC) ..°
8 Do you remember that?

aL MSU reporting is?
12 A. No.
13. Q. “These would then be investigated and resolved by the
14 ssc.”
15 Is that right?
16 A. I can't remember
17 Q. Andthenin 42.1 he says
18 “Since the introduction of Horizon in 1999 there
19 have been 735 live incidents which refer to ‘payments
20 and receipt mismatch’ (ie incidents recorded against
21 ‘components of the system providing Horizon service to
22 Post Office rather than incidents raised against test
23 systems)”

3 across all incidents where the title or one of the
4 incident updates contains all of the words ‘receipts ’,
5 "payments’, ‘mismatch””
6 Would you agree that there would bea fair way of
7 trying to find the relevant PEAKs in this respect?
8 A. If you're looking for receipts and payments or mismatch
9 then yes.
10 Q. I'm grateful:
11 "It should be noted that this is not 735 unique
12 incidents; there will be a lot of duplicates with the
13 same root cause”
14 Would you agree with that?
15 A. [can’t disagree with it.
16 Q. “The only way to determine how many unique incidents
17 there were would be to manually review all of the
18 incidents ”
19 I take it you would agree with that?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q “All of them were resolved.”
22 Do you accept that?
23 A. [can’t comment.

24 MRJUSTICE FRASER: I don't think he would bein a position

25 to -- I meana question would be I suppose: from your

170

eIAHkYOnE

time there do you remember any that were not resolved?

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Yes, thank you.

A. 1 -- only vague memories of some things that may have
not been -- we couldn't pin anything down specifically
to code, or we couldn't find a problem, so it was
assumed that the postmaster must have made a mistake.

Q. Well, you say “assumed”, Mr Roll, wouldn't it be fair to
say that when you're looking at -- we're now looking at
software coding issues, you're looking for coding issues
that may have caused a problem, would you agree that an
enormously thorough amount of analysis is done to try
and figure out how a coding problem may have caused this
particular symptom; would you accept that?

A. Yes.

Q. And the SSC would keep going, people like the five
specialists and indeed you when you were involved on
those occasions, you would keep going until you had
satisfied yourself, as far as any human being could,
that it wasn't down toa coding error; would you accept
that?

A. Sometimes there were times ~ well, sometimes there were

time constraints from what I remember, so you had a few

days to find a problem and produce an answer.

"Sometimes". How often did that occur?

A. I-couldn’t say, but that’s one of the things that sticks

171

in my mind that there were occasions. Very
infrequently.

Q. I'm grateful.
{62/11/12}:
"These incidents

Let's move on to page 12 please

We are now talking about receipts and payments
mismatches:

‘These incidents are reported as a result of
self consistency checks carried out by Horizon. It
should be noted that a R&P mismatch is not only caused

by a software error, It can also be caused by

product reference .. data
That's right, isn’t it?
AL Yes.
Then 42.3

“Receipts and payments mismatches happened more

often during the early life of Horizon

And there is a reference to a tab which I will go to
in a moment:

“My analysis of that data shows that there were
around 8.6 such incidents per month on average between
1 January 2001 and 31 December 2014 (417 out of a total
of 27,005 incidents into SSC, or 1.5% of SSC incidents
during that period)”

We can goto the table if you like but I apprehend

Day 3

1 MRDEGARR ROBINSON: Coding.
2 MRJUSTICE FRASER: I seem to be the only person who cares
3 about what words are used.
4 MR DEGARR ROBINSON: So if we could go back to paragraph 10
5 please on page 2 of the same document (E1/7/2}. You say
6 that -- you refer to software issues, which we now know
7 is a wider category, it’s both coding issues and data
8 issues
9 *.. could and did cause financial discrepancies
10 if wewere unable to find the cause of the discrepancy
at then this was reported up the chain and it was assumed
12 that the postmaster was to blame”
13 When you say “reported up the chain”, to whom was it
14 reported?
15 A. To our manager and that’s as far as I knew. I don’t
16 know where it went after that
17 Q Andwhy would you reportit up the chain? Why wouldn't
18 you just complete the PEAK in the normal way? There
19 seems to be some significance attached to a process of
20 reporting?
21 A. Usually, from wharI remember, there was some pressure
22 onus to come toa resolution, a solution
23 Q. Oh, youmean~ I see, so do I understand this, that it
24 wasn’t -- the management didn’t want you to close your
25 eyes to issues of that sort, management wanted you to
7
1 figure out what the problem was?
2 A. Quickly.
3 Q. That was the encouragement that
4 A. They wanted a quick answer, yes
5 Q. No, let's take this in stages. They wanted you to
6 figure out what the problem was, is that right?
7A. Yes
8 Q. And now you have added the word “quick”. Why do you say
9 quick
10 A. “Quick” was perhaps the wrong word.
11 Q. -- doyouthink that’s entirely fair?
12. A. AsI recall, sometimes we felt under pressure to
13 provide -- to examine the data and give an answer within
14 the timescale.
15 Q So sometimes the SSC was busier than other times and
16 when the SSC was busy then sometimes you would say,
17 what, you didn’t have as much time as you would have
18 liked to have got to the bottom of the problem?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q Andin that situation where you hadn't done enough you
21 would report that situation up to your manager, would
22 you?
23 A. Yes
24 Q. And that would be Mr Peach, would it?
25 A. Yes.

And what would Mr Peach say?
I don't know what he said to his -- to the management
above that, I"ve got no idea
But it would be fair to say -- I think I’m-- I hopeI'’m
drawing the right inference from whatyou said a minute
ago -- it would be fair to say that Mr Peach would want
you to bottom out the issue, to get to the bottom -
Yes.

of that issue that was reported to you. He didn’t
want you to close your eyes to a problem, did he?
No.
I'm very grateful, Mr Roll

When you encountered a coding issue which had
well, did you ever encounter a coding issue which had
a financial impact on the branch account?
I can’t remember. There were times when I suspected
something like that and passed it on, from what I do
remember, to one of the other
To seek more senior people
Yes.

who might be able to look at it in more greater
depth?
Yes.
But you don’t recall ever having encountered, in all the

PEAKs that you worked on, a coding issue that definitely

179

caused a financial impact?
I don't recall discovering one, no.
I'm grateful.

So my next question was going to be when you were in
that position, what would you do, but I apprehend that
you won't be able to answer that question?

I can’t remember.

I was going to ask you about identifying all the
branches that were affected by that coding issue but

I apprehend that it’s just not something you can speak
to, is that right?

No.
Isee. Can you just give mea moment. I'm sorry to
keep you waiting.

So if we could go to {E2/11/3]. Paragraph 17,
Mr Parker says:

“On the very rare occasion that a software problem
which could cause a financial impact in branch accounts
arose, it would be investigated and resolved and Fujitsu
‘would determine its impact on the Horizon estate and
inform Post Office of any financial impact on branches
so that they could be resolved”

Would I be right in thinking that’s just not
something that’s within your experience because you were
never in that situation?

1A. Yes.

2 Q. Then! don’t need to go there.

3 My Lord, it occurs to me that now might be

4 a convenient moment.

5 MRJUSTICE FRASER: All right.

6 Mr Roll, I said at the break you were going to go

7 overnight, so if you could come back tomorrow please,

8 10.30.

9 AL Yes
10 MRJUSTICE FRASER: And remember what I said about not
11 talking to anyone about your evidence. ‘That doesn’t
12 mean that you can’t talk to anyone about anything, but
13 you can’t talk to anyone about your case or your
14 evidence.
15 Housekeeping
16 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Couple of housekeeping things, we may as
17 ‘well deal with them now. I don’t think I have had
18 a file next of your witness statements for next week

19 MR DE GARR ROBINSON: No, that's in hand, my Lord.

20  MRJUSTICE FRASER: I would also like a single -- and this

21 can be doneas a running file. The PEAKs thatare being
22 used in cross-examination -- and I think there have only
23 been two or three of them so far -- if I can just have
24 a hard copy of whichever ones are in fact used and those
25 just put in a file and that file can be updated each
181

1 day.

2 MR DEGARR ROBINSON: My Lord, we can prepare that. That

3 would be helpful

4 MRJUSTICE FRASER: At the moment! think there is just the

5 ones used in opening plus the three from today, so it’s

6 not going to be very difficult

7 MR GREEN: My Lord, would you like as we go along to have

8 a second section with the associated KELs?

9 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Yes, if that's going to be useful.
10 MRGREEN: I think typically you may see both.

11° MRJUSTICE FRASER: Allright. So that’s that

12 You were going to tell me how many documents had had
13 to be disclosed result of your recollection , or the

14 redaction review.

15 MR DEGARR ROBINSON: I was. My Lord, may we do it tomorrow
16 morning?

17 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Do it tomorrow, yes, we will do it at

18 the end of tomorrow.

19 1 would like both your openings in Word but not the
20 appendices. And then I thought I would just give you an
21 outline on the current plan on the judgment in common
22 issues. I've hada list of typos from the claimants.

23 That has not affected the intended timetable to hand it
24 down on Friday. I imagine I will have some-- I think
25 the time I asked for them was 5 o'clock, so I know it is

182

a different team,

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: I'm afraid I know nothing about ~

MR JUSTICE FRASER: No, it is just on the basis that it is
the Post Office here, I thought I would just say.
Assuming they are in the normal scope of typographical
errors, et cetera, I’m still on track to be able to hand
it down finally on Friday at 12 o’clock, but if thar
changes I will tell _you tomorrow.

‘Then one grammatical point which you may or may not
find amusing, I do, but I thought I would ask you.
“Subpostmasters” in the draft judgment you will see
I abbreviated to a three letter abbreviation, or TLA, of
SPM. I have put it as the indefinite article “an SPM”.
Mr Warwick's helpful corrections have suggested that
throughout it should be changed to "a SPM’.
mind because it takes a single keystroke, but in terms
of grammar I thought it should be “an” SPM but thought
1 would explore your views before I hand down a 180,000
word judgment riddled with a potential grammatical

1 don't

inaccuracy. So Mr De Garr Robinson?

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Your Lordship will have seen from our
submissions we say “an” SPM.

MR GREEN: My Lord, I have no problem with “an” SPM at all .

MR JUSTICE FRASER: You hadn't spotted that.

I actually know with absolute precision what the rule is

I'mnotsure

183

for abbreviations, but we will probably stay with “an”.
Anything else?

MR GREEN: No, my Lord.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: 10.30 tomorrow.

See you tomorrow, Mr Roll. Thank you all very much.
