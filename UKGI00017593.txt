Subject: RE: POL discussion with SoS and Kelly Tolhurst

HiAll,
Please see readout below of the call between Kelly and POL this afternoon with few actions. Let me know if anything
doesn’t make sense or if I’ve misunderstood something.

It would also be good to get an update on when we plan to make this departmental public statement. Thanks!

Participants;

Kelly Tolhurst

Tim Parker

Al Cameron

Jane MacLeod

Gavin Lambert

Tom Cooper

Hibaq Said

Actions:
* KT Private Office to set-up a call with Al Cameron on Tuesday morning before Orals, so that Kelly gets an
update on the boards discussions the previous day.

* Gavin/Tom to ensure our office is kept well informed of progress and to provide a weekly update.

Discussion Points:
« TP was surprised by the outcome of the judgment, however POL’s intention is to be fair and not defensive and
aim to bring a good case to reach a fair settlement. He confirmed that they would look at their procedures and
the opportunities to improve. He acknowledged where they can do things better, and if it costs them money
(could be as much as £100m) they will look to manage the costs. He mentioned there was a few legal points
that were of concern and they will be receiving subsequent advice to review this in more detail, and looking at
whether they should do an appeal. KT stated the importance that BEIS are consulted before they make any
intention to appeal.

* They are currently assembling as much information they can, so at their board meeting on Monday, they
know what needs to be done. They will discuss ways to improve the manner they run their branches, so when
disputes arise they are dealt with fairly. They will also look to review the question on where the judge has been
biased on and whether they will ask him to recuse himself from the horizon trial. Unlikely that we will do this,
but they will consider whether it is an action, they should take forward. It is a legal pressing matter that would
need to be addressed sooner rather than later. (Line was fuzzy/ interruption at this point - so I may have not
captured this correctly)
UKG1I00017593
UKGI00017593

* Al Cameron made clear that they would not go down this route until there was final agreement with
everyone and will of course keep us updated. They will also discuss their views of the rationale of doing an
appeal and where the focus is. They have started doing work streams since the judgement, such as the process
of managing differences correctly. He mentioned that some of the cases are 20 years old and how it will be hard
for them to be exactly sure of the circumstances. However, they will not be avoiding their liability, they are
going to listen but will also highlight where they have improved in cases over time. They are also looking at
mediation schemes, to compensate people that were treated badly.

© KT outlined that it was a disappointing judgement, she understood the complexities that they face and
appreciated that they are taking this seriously. In regards to the liabilities, she said £100m was a significant
amount, and that Government may be involved in the sign off or funding of this amount. They discussed the
operational issues and the criticism faced on the culture and practices. She highlighted the point that as the
responsible Minister she will be held to account and rightly so in the House and how this should be bared in
mind. On that basis, she stressed the importance of Post Office sharing information with BEIS and that she is
kept updated throughout the whole process.

© KT made the point that this judgement could justify the criticisms the Post Office are receiving on postmasters
pay. She addressed that the issues on the franchising plans and postmasters pay and this judgement will be
perceived as the same argument, with the ongoing concerns on Post Office. TP outlined that it was important to
keep the issues separate if possible, but understands the difficulties within this. KT highlighted her concerns on
the impression she was given at her last meeting with Post Office on the case, and the expectation that there
would be a better outcome then what was handed. Therefore was concerned about the legal advice and
independence of this and how important it was to understand the issues.

* She informed them that she would be meeting with 10 labour MPs on franchising on Monday, and that they
will mention this judgement. She raised the point that where there has been unjust actions against employees,
individuals should receive settlements where postmasters have been affected.

* KT asked who will be leading on this, as Paula had step down and emphasised the need for her to have an
understanding of the actions that Post Office will be taking forward. She expressed her appreciation of the work
of the Post Office and how it is managed. TP confirmed Al Cameron would be in charge, and leading on this and
that they were fortunate to have him, as he knows the company very well. TP informed KT that in terms of
advice, they had two senior QCs and could not expect to have a better advocate. However when it comes to
deciding on whether they should appeal they will look to get an independent person, and their lawyers feel that
there is good grounds to appeal.

* They discussed the franchising programme and that as a board they believe it will improve the sustainability
of the Post Office. TP said that they were looking at ways of improving the rewards for postmasters, such as the
NSSP that looks at the banking framework and creates more work for postmasters. As part of this, their
remuneration would increase. KT said she defends the franchising programme and the Post Office, however
needs to have comfort and confidence that when there is feedback for them, they are actioned. She then gave
an example of a recent franchising issue brought to her attention. Al Cameron provided an update on the
banking framework. KT offered her assistance and informed POL that she was happy to put pressure on the
banks if required, and help remove any blocks. She mentioned that she had spoken recently with HMT Ministers
to get them to put some pressure on the banks.

* KT asked about their legal team defending their positions and advice. She asked whether there would be any
change of strategy on dealing with the horizon litigation. JM provided an update of the four separate trials. The
Horizon trial driven by evidence and by independent witnesses (appointed on each side) she then went on to
explain the various evidence that will be taken into account. They discussed the two trials in November and how
the judge wants to look at issues of limitation. The judge wants an answer on whether the limitation act applies
UKG1I00017593
UKGI00017593

to these trials. The fourth trial will be looking at representative claimants and breaches; this will be a
conventional trial process. The judge has dictated the sequencing of the questions; therefore POL’s strategy is
how to respond to these questions. Al Cameron said as they will be receiving new advice from a different QC
this will bring forward other perspectives, the quality of this advice will guide their thinking of their strategy.

* KT reiterated that it was incredibly important in her view that as much information is shared with us as
possible. She requested a detailed update next week after the board meeting, to know what the board’s
strategy is and what their next steps are in taking this forward. Al Cameron was more than happy to brief the
Minister on updates as and when appropriate — whether that be weekly in person or via phone to ensure she
has the close oversight she has requested. Which KT appreciated and will follow up with them if she has any
additional questions.

Lastly KT said she was concerned that Paula resigning will be perceived negatively, considering she has taken
on another role that has been publicised. Therefore would like to understand the exact recruitment process to
get a new CEO and for this to be set out clearly. As having this in place will help to defend possible criticisms
and speculation. Al Cameron confirmed they will share this.

It's a fair comment. I think the early versions achieved a better balance between not commenting on the
result of the current hearing and the SoS’s desire to show that we are supportive of the case taking place
to achieve a remedy for those postmasters who have a just claim.

Dear Colleague,

Postmasters are the backbone of the Post Office, and their branches are the backbone of communities
across the country. That’s why we committed to safeguarding the post office network and protecting
existing rural services. The overall number of post offices across the UK remains at its most stable in

decades with over 11,500 branches thanks to significant Government investment of over £2 billion.

The Post Office and I are fully supportive of this legal case being brought. This first judgment, which

deals with the contractual relationship between the Post Office and postmasters, re

The judge has been highly critical of the Post Office’s handling of the case and finds the Post Office’s
conduct in its dealings with the lead claimant postmasters have been heavy-handed, some of its

operations insufficiently transparent, and its procedures and processes lacking in consistency and
UKG1I00017593
UKGI00017593

professionalism.

The judgement is complex and lengthy and the Post Office will need time to consider in detail, however
having spoken today with the Chairman of POL, I am assured they have acknowledged the criticism, are

taking it very seriously, and will be taking appropriate action where necessary.

Legal proceedings in this case are currently scheduled to continue until at least March 2020. Whilst this
remains a matter for the court and it is not appropriate for Government to comment further. However, I
will be remaining in close contact with the Post Office over the coming weeks and months as they

deliver on their commitments to improve.

I understand that this issue will be of interest and concern to Members of the House and, as this process
progresses, I will update Members further.

It would be accurate to say “...significant step towards delivering justice...”

Sorry. I actually think the opposite. As drafted it looks more like we agree with the judgement than

What we’ve now also lost is the SOS’s wish to communicate that we want postmasters who have

been done wrong to get justice.
