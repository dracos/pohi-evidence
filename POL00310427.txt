Subject: Sparrow - An idea at pace!
Hi Paula

Al's comments sparked an idea which I think we should get worked up (Patrick had a similar thought and contributes the
key element below).

Essentially we have a position where no-one is happy with the Mediation Scheme. MPs have withdrawn support. The
JFSA did not contribute yday and is meeting on Sunday to consider its position.

Our people is that if we close the scheme down we will be accused of bad faith either way. But what if at the same time
we offered applicants a payment - say £5,000 - only to be used to mount a case in the courts.

The narrative would be a strong one: we have all faith in our system but as a responsible business, having taken a lot of
very reasonable steps which have not satisfied anyone, we are now prepared to offer applicants funding to take legal
advice.

We could give them an option if this is not what they want - to continue with the investigation process with mediation if
appropriate.

We could in this scenario remove Second Sight but suggest they are used by applicants to prepare their case.
If 100 applicants opted for this it would cost £0.5m. The scheme as it stands will cost at least a further £3m.
Clearly this needs to be worked up properly - but I do think it is worth considering, including legal risk, quickly.
If you are content I will ask the team to do so.
