FORMER SUBPOSTMASTERS ACCOUNTS i
WRITE OFF AUTHORITY

Office FAD Code: 213 337
Office Name: Marine Drive
Former Sub postmaster’s Name: Lee Castleton

Reason for Leaving: Suspension

Amount to.be written off: £25,858.95

Agents Debt Team Member: Martyn Mitchell
Date: 26/07/2007

Summary Of Action Taken To Recover Debt’

e MrCastleton was the Subpostmaster of Marine Drive Post
Office from 19/07/03 to 23/03/04 until his Suspension.

* Mr Castletons debt mainly consisted of a audit shortage of
£25,858.95 & some other minor accounting: errors

« MrCastleton always disputed the debt claimed that the loss
was due to the faulty Horizon System.

* This case eventually went to court and Mr Castleton’s claim
was unsuccessful and the court ordered Mr Castleton to
repay the whole loss any all costs incurred by POL.

* MrCastleton has declared himself bankrupt and has a year
to sell his property or as POL are the largest creditor we can
put the house up for sale through a Trustee

¢ Any recoveries will be posted to offset this loss

He had declared himself bankrupt which was expected and we are still awaiting details of the
valuation. after a year if he has not sold the property the rights of his kids to have a house over their
heads becomes an irrelevance and as the largest creditor we can put the property up for sale through
a trustee in bankruptcy.

Have there been any recent developments on this case? The last information I have shows that we
were going to commission a valuation on Lee Castleton's property.
