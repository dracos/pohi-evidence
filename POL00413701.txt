There are many misleading opinions, but there is nothing that I can find that is factually inaccurate, the journalist has
been very careful in his choice of words. [I would ignore the misunderstanding that the SISD procurement is for a
replacement of Horizon as I think it is irrelevant]

I don’t think we should try to respond with nick picking technical corrections but rather stay above the fray by saying
that Post Office, as stated previously, is committed to address these issue by working collaboratively with JFSA and
subpostmasters. If any ex-subpostmaster would like to raise concerns they should do so via the JFSA who will work with

the subpostmaster to ensure the case is properly dealt with. Or something like that.

Regards, Simon

Please see this blog posted by a freelance journalist and tweeted tonight by Matt Prodger from
the BBC. In it, Alan Bates announces the mediation panel.

I think elements of the article are possibly actionable, and would like a legal view on that
(though of course taking action of that kind would draw more attention to the story - but a view
would be good). It is certainly skewed.

I think this underlines the need for a proactive approach next week.

It also contradicts of course the claim that Alan Bates made that he wouldn't be using the media.
