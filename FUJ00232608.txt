0.4 Abbreviations/Definitions

Unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms have the following meanings:

Abbreviation Definition

APS Automated Payments Service (Schedule 18)

AP Client Automated Payments Client

AP Agent The term given to Post Office Clients (or Service Suppliers) who receive
APS file transmissions via the EDG Gateway from Fujitsu Services.
AP Clients who are not also AP Agents, receive their files indirectly, via a
Post Office Client (or Service Supplier) acting as their Agent.

CSC CSC being the provider that manages the EDG Gateway on behalf of POL

EDG Client An AP Client that receives its file via the EDG Gateway.

Girobank Client

An AP Client that is connected to the AP Service via the AP Agent
Girobank.

Live Client

An AP Client becomes live when the physical connection is established and
configuration completed such that Client transactions can be passed across
the interface. The Client is then considered live until the Client connection
service is terminated and files cannot be transmitted. This is at a mutually
agreed time, typically at least one month subsequent to Client Token
termination, to allow the harvesting, from the branches, of any delayed
Client transactions.

Non-Girobank Client

An AP Client that is connected to the AP Service via an AP Agent other
than Girobank.

[Terms defined in this Agreement shall have the same meaning where used in this CCD]
