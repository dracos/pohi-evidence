AUDIT, RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE
Financial Crime Risk Update
Author: Sally Smith Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Meeting Date: 17% May 2018

Executive Summary

Context

This paper updates the Audit and Risk Committee on financial crime risks relating
to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) and Anti-
Bribery and Corruption and compliance with The Money Laundering, Terrorist
Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 and
The Terrorism Act 2000.

Questions this paper addresses

What are the key AML and CTF risks within Post Office Ltd and are there any
significant gaps or weaknesses in the Post Office’s compliance with its
regulatory obligations under the Money Laundering Regulations (MLRs)?
What is the current position with the post HMRC Audit Bureau de Change
remediation project

What is the current position with financial crime risk assessments.

Are the minimum control standards in the Post Office’s Anti-Bribery and
Corruption and Whistleblowing Policies being effectively applied?

Conclusion

1.

A letter setting out Post Office interpretation of Fit & Proper and Customer
Due Diligence regulatory requirements, and re-affirming the approach that
we are taking in order to comply is being drafted to send to HMRC.

The project team are progressing with the work needed for the Fit & Proper
requirements, but there is still significant work to meet the June 2018
deadline and to ensure that the ongoing framework is robust.

There have been further delays with the Bureau de Change remediation
projects with implementation of the data warehouse solution pushed back to
June. The eKYC, PEPs and Sanctions solution is on target for deployment
once the data solution is live.

Risk assessment work continues, although there are a number of new or
updated Product Information Packs that remain outstanding, and these are
being chased. There are a significant number requiring assessment during
May and June.

There continue to be failures in Gifts & Hospitality reporting and further
training and communications are planned. The volume of Whistleblowing
reports was lower in March and posters to raise awareness for deployment
to all sites are currently being developed.

Compliance with MLRs

6.

10.

Annual training for Network and back office staff is being delivered 4*° - 30%
May 2018. Of the 2 branches that have not completed their training from
last year, chargeable visits are being arranged to resolve.

Following the visit from HMRC in March in relation to Fit & Proper and
Customer Due Diligence, external lawyers are currently drafting a formal
letter to HMRC to set out Post Office interpretation of the requirements, and
re-affirm the approach that we are taking in order to comply.

The HR Fit & Proper project team are continuing to progress actions as
previously agreed with our HMRC supervisor and aim to have all directors
and beneficial owners identified by early May. An additional 62 internal
employees are currently being re-vetted prior to submitting formal
applications to HMRC. Retail have commenced contact with multiple partners
to identify impacted individuals and understand what vetting and training
already exists. There is still a significant amount of work to meet the June
2018 deadline, and other activities include:

e Identifying data gaps and required communications and actions to
resolve

e Identification of a system to store all of the Fit & Proper data

¢ Identification and documentation of training for each of the sets of
impacted individuals and the records required

Non-conformance issues in the Network from 1% March 2018 to April 20%
2018 included 35 incidents identified at 31 branches.

« 6 branches identified were Directly Managed Branches and/or WH Smith
Multiples and these have been addressed by the Financial Crime Team
and escalated to Network as appropriate.

« 13 branches remain on the non-conformance watch list following the
new ID thresholds and are manually monitored monthly.

« No new branches were added or removed.

The volume of suspicious activity reports (SARs) decreased in March and April
2018, with reductions in MoneyGram and Bureau de Change reports. Branch
communications to raise awareness are planned for the beginning of May
2018, which together with the annual training should improve the volumes
of SARs reported.

Bureau de Change remediation project status

11.

The new data warehouse delivery has been postponed until early June, from
the original commitment to HMRC by the project team of delivery in January
2018. This delay is due to issues identified whilst mapping across the
historical bureau data, where a number of key fields had not been included

INTERNAL Page 2 of 6 6.3 Financial Crime Risk ARC
Update1.0
POL00423413

POL00423413

in the new data environment and there were significant gaps in the
documented data dictionary — neither the data dictionary nor the fields being
included in the data environment had been signed off appropriately. All fields
have now been properly documented, reviewed and signed off, and the data
environment is being re-built, after which there will be significant testing of
the data and the new reports. Financial Services & Telecoms have brought
in additional resource to oversee the project to ensure delivery.

12. The eKYC, capability was tested late March in the Model Office and a number
of anomalies were identified relating to ‘false’ data that had been tested that
passed the checks. Clarification of the logic used was provided by CallCredit
and Digidentity, and some amendments have now been made, which have
improved test results. Re-testing has been undertaken and the eKYC, PEPs
and Sanctions solution will be deployed once the data warehouse is delivered
(the original commitment to HMRC by the project team was to deliver this in
April 2018).

Financial Crime Risk Assessment

13. Work on risk assessment continues as BAU, and Appendix A gives full updates
on the status of Product Information Pack (PIP) completion and re-
assessment work. Gift Card and Bill Payments PIPs are still outstanding
following the October 2017 incidents and are being chased, along with five
following the product manager workshops in November. There are a
significant number of assessments required during May and June.

14. Asa result of a recent internal fraud, the risk assessment/PIPs for Postal
Orders, Gift Card and other ‘anonymous’ products need to be
reviewed/updated urgently

15. Due to resource required to cover these assessments and the Bureau de
Change and Fit & Proper projects, we have not yet been able to schedule
further financial crime risk assessment training, although this is still in plan.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) update

16. Quarterly reports were sent to all GE members early April (see summary
table below). There were a number of breaches in Q4 which have been
advised to respective GE members and include retrospective reporting,
incorrect description (e.g. ‘hospitality’ rather than ‘dinner with X at Y’) and
incorrect GEs being listed to approve reports.

17. A review of entertainment expenses claimed in Q4 identified a number of
instances where these had not been reported via the Gifts & Hospitality tool.
There are also a number which have either been incorrectly classified by the
claimant or incorrect/insufficient information provided. Analysis of this data
is not yet complete, but issues will be reported to relevant GE members.

18. Further communication and training is being developed to improve the level
and quality of recording and reporting, and annual training has been brought
forward to July.

mismanagement. All reports are investigated with recommendations made
and followed up. 7 reports are still under investigation - the oldest dating
