Neil

I appreciate what you are saying, and I am happy to wait for the information, at appeal the subpostmistress clearly
indicated she believed that all her losses were due to this area, whilst I very much doubt this, I am obliged to prove
otherwise and this data will allow me to do this., I was told by the subpostmistress that when she received TC’s
relating to lottery/scratchcards she was told to adjust the stock figures to agree with what the system derived figures
should be and again whilst I explained that only the TC should have been processed which would either create a cash
surplus or shortage dependent on the type of TC so adjusting the stock to derived figures would only great more TC’s
she is adamant that this is what she was told, this would clearly create more TC’s hence stock adjustments. I would
like to see also any data you have on stock adjustments so that when I make my decision I can inform her of all the
data I have reviewed in making my decision.

Hi Cathy.

Are we certain that this relates to Lottery? Over the last 3 —- 4 months I’ve had queries
on £15k and then £10k saying this relates to Lottery, but when I’ve looked yes I find
errors but nothing approaching the figures quoted. I’ve had Chris Knight ( fraud
investigator ) sit with me and he feels as I do that whatever their problems are it isn’t
related to the Lottery. The notable thing I did discover was the highest number of
stock adjustments I’ve ever seen, 119 from 01.01.08 to 21.08.10 for a total of
£1,760.00.

Due to the time the request for evidence will take can you please confirm that it really
is necessary to produce this data.

I'll always help when I can.

Regards
Neil

Cathy

I have heard the appeal in relation to this branch, the subpostmistress is claiming that the almost £15K of losses that
she had been covering up relate almost exclusively to Lottery Scratchcards, she has stated that although she has had
the lottery for over 3 and a half years the problems have only come to light in the last 15 to 18 months, she stated that
the problem was that she was remitting in the scartachcards on receipt and then activating them at a later date (when
she needed them)

Could your team provide me with the following information (if not your team can you direct me to who can)

Remittances (IN & OUT) Lottery Scratchcards from September 2008 — September 2010 (or as far back as we can
go to this date please)

Scratchcard Activations from September 2008 — September 2010 (or as far back as we can go
to this date please)

Declared scratchcard sales from September 2008 — September 2010 (or as far back as we can go
to this date please)

Any Scratchcard prizes paid from September 2008 — September 2010 (or as far back as we can go
to this date please)

Not sure how difficult this is but anything you can do in this area would be greatly appreciated
