1 Purpose

This document sets out ICL Pathway’s proposals that Acceptance Incident 218,
currently a medium severity incident, has an agreed resolution plan and that its
achievement will allow Acceptance Incident 218 to be Closed.

2 Summary

The Acceptance Incident was raised stating that "the majority of offices were
experiencing considerable ongoing difficulty in performing the completion of office
cash accounts.

Since then, there have been a number of developments in different areas to support the
closure plan for AI218. These areas are detailed below and all activities are included
in the overall resolution plan and activities are on schedule. A set of success criteria
have been drawn up and were passed to ICL Pathway on 26 August 1999.

The closure report reflects the application of the appropriate set of success criteria and
cross refers to the relevant measurement, analysis and ‘agreement to close' activities to
be included in version 0.3 of the Rectification Plan.

3 Detailed activities

These have been in the areas described below. Where applicable the dates associated
with these activities are contained within the Timetable, Part B of Schedule 2 of the
second Supplementary Agreement (“the timetable”).

Application software: changes have been made, principally in the area of stock unit
balancing and cash account to both software and surrounding processes to make the
task of office balancing easier to understand and complete. These changes were
implemented for LT2 and have proved successful in live use.

Training: changes have been made to the managers' training event to spend more
time on the areas of error handling, printer use and principally stock unit balancing
and cash account. Again, these changes have proven successful in live events.

Help Desk: The Horizon Systems Helpdesk (HSH) has now been strengthened by the
addition of a cash account domain on Wednesdays and Thursdays. This is to ensure a
more advanced level of support for offices that are encountering cash account
problems.

Further to the activities above, a workshop took place on 13th August which identified
seven specific areas for potential improvement in association with AI218. Commercial
consequences of the actions below are agreed in an exchange of letters between Bruce

McNiven of POCL and Liam Foley of ICL Pathway(ref B.McNiven letter of 3rd Sept.

and Liam Foley's letter of 8th Sept.).

These areas are as follows:

e  Pre-Entry Event

ICL Pathway has offered to develop and run 370 half day events for a maximum of
4,400 office managers. This is a new event and the dates for the development of this
event are covered in detail within the timetable. Specification of the event is defined
in doc. IM/PRO/172, version 0.2 - Specification of pre-entry event. This specification
has been agreed with POCL through joint working groups.

¢ Post Installation Care

References were made in the success criteria for AI218 to the importance of an agreed
resolution plan for Al408. It has been jointly agreed that the Resolution Plan for
A1408 is sufficient to cover any residual concerns about post installation care and
consequent references to training.

e Post Installation Competency Strategy

The joint workshop on 13 August accepted that not all users within the large
population will ‘absorb’ Horizon. This may eventually call for closure of the outlet,
replacement of the sub-postmaster or training of additional staff. It has been agreed
between POCL and ICL Pathway that other steps taken within this resolution plan
should minimise the risk of this and that any residual fallout will be handled by
POCL. POCL have agreed to review and strengthen the relevant process. This is
reflected in the timetable.

¢ Monitoring Of Training Delivery

ICL Pathway has produced a document IM/PRD/066, version 0.2 - Monitoring of
Trainer Quality to detail the processes and procedures that are adopted by
Knowledgepool to ensure a high quality of training delivery. This document has been
reviewed by POCL and comments made which have been reflected in the latest issue
of the document.

e¢ User Competency

POCL asserted that the Performance Standard Assessment (PSA) was proving too
subjective with potentially too much trainer assistance thus allowing trainees to pass
the PSA who would subsequently prove to be unable to handle Horizon in the live
environment. ICL Pathway and POCL have worked closely together to review the
PSA and to arrive at an agreed test to administer on the training courses. The actions
to achieve this are reflected in the timetable.

e Post Training Consolidation

It is recognised by POCL and ICL Pathway that insufficient use is being made of
training mode in the live environment. The parties have worked together to formulate
ideas for promotion of training mode in the live offices. Work on this subject is on-
going and the activities are reflected in the timetable.

e Agreed Training Course Changes

The changes raised by Trevor Rollason of POCL as a result of dry runs of the training
courses have been implemented and all courses are now signed off.

All of the above areas of activity are reflected in the timetable and all activities
scheduled to be completed have been. All other activities are on schedule.

ACCEPTANCE INCIDENT - 218

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

The Following table defines the critical success factors (CSFs) which should be
applied to each of the activities to enable the resolution of Acceptance Incident 218. In
essence the CSFs are consistent with those defined for the evaluation of the LT2

Horizon system release.

Measure

Target

Reduction in demand on support -
Measured through a reduction in the
number of calls (at the peak time on
Wednesday evening and Thursday
morning) for advice and guidance to
support stock unit balancing, office
balancing and production of the cash
account received at the HSH and/or at
the NBSC.

Two time periods defined:

peak: Wed 12.00 noon - Thurs 12.00
noon

off-peak: the rest of the week

ICL Pathway to provide details of
calls received at HSH from additional
offices, breaking out calls by
categories, date, FAD code and
associated pinICL number

On average NBSC should not receive
more than 1.2 calls per week from
outlets when performing their first two
balances.

Reduction in the length of calls from
additional offices .

Overall the aim is to achieve a call time
of 5 minutes for calls in peak time (e.g.
Wednesday evening) and 2.5 minutes
for off peak calls to NBSC and HSH.

The number of offices unable to
complete the cash account balance
process and produce a cash account
balance.

As with current practice, cash account
balances with explicit reasons for a
discrepancy are still considered to be
valid.

Resolution Plan

Ref: CR/ACD/218
Version: 0.5
Date: 23/9/99

FUJ00119612
FUJ00119612

Time taken to produce a stock unit
balance, the office balance and finally
produce a cash account.

It is assumed that the time taken for
balancing excludes any instances
where business related discrepancies
occur, e.g lost vouchers etc.

Ina typical sub-post office the overall
process for producing stock unit
balances, an office balance and the cash
account should be completed within
2.5 hours. In an ECCO office the
process should be completed within
4.Shours.

User generated error reported by TP,
in both CLASS and PIVOT.

Pre Horizon baseline level for same
outlets.

Level of success of Users against the
Performance Standard Assessment
(PSA).

At least 95% success rate.

All support material must mirror the
system e.g. training materials, guides,

operating manuals and Training Mode.

There should be no inconsistencies (as
reported to the NBSC).

[Mitigation - Where inconsistencies are
identified there should be an agreed
resolution plan.]
