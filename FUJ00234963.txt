DRS System Date

Defi

ion

The logical DRS business day. DRS business day falls between running DRS Start of
Day and DRS End of Day jobs. Normally same as the calendar day DRS Start of Day

was run on.

Eternus

Astorage system supplied by Fujitsu.

Reconciliation Date

The Reconciliation Date is the date attributed to a transaction to allow PO Ltd to
reconcile. It will be set to the first available Settlement Date from the Transaction
Elements ({C112], [C12], [C4], [S], [D]) that make up that transaction. If no Settlement
Date is available, the Reconciliation Date will be set to the processing date that the
DRS first recorded any element of the transaction. If a Settlement Date subsequently
becomes available, the first available Settlement Date will replace the processing
date. However, once a transaction has been accounted for on a reconciliation report,

the Reconciliation Date will never change.

Routing Gateway

The Routing Gateway as defined Network Banking Message Flows and Interfaces

[DES/APP/IFS/0006].

Run Date

The DRS logical date listed on a report and shows which calendar day the data is for.
It is same as DRS System Date in all cases except NB103 reports where it is a day

(configurable) behind DRS System Date.

Settlement Date

The date on which the Client has settled the transaction (in some instances a default
is set by the Banking Host). The Settlement Date will be allocated by the Client (or
failing that the Banking Host) and included in both authorisations and confirmations.
The [C4], [S], and [D] always contain a Settlement Date. Other messages may

contain a Settlement Date.

1 Introduction
1.1 Document Overview
This document describes the operational requirements of the DRS application. The document
also describes the procedures for supporting and tuning the application.
ETU Transactions are considered, for the purposes of this document, to be a subset of Network
Banking transactions. The DRS is not performing any ETU or NSI specific functionality.
Like other host systems, the DRS application has been designed to fail-over from one data centre
to the fallback data centre without the need for operator intervention. The restart which requires
an operator intervention can be done on the fall-over data centre.
DRS application performs two main functions during a business day:
1. Provide a high throughput Reconciliation Service handling Debit Card, and Network Banking
transactions in large volumes.
2. Provide an Online Database for 91 (configurable) days to support the Reconciliation Reports
and the Online Query and Resolution System.
The database schema and application modules that primarily deal with the first function have
been designed to provide high throughput and make use of parallelism in processing.
The schema objects and modules (batch and online) that facilitate the second function have been
designed to meet the query requirements with quickest response time.
Most DRS jobs that run as a part of the Network Banking and Debit Card TWS Schedules make
use of checkpoints. These checkpoints are created/maintained in the database and offer the
following benefits:
e Minimise the work that needs to be re-done in the event of fail-over from one data centre
to the other.
* Prevent duplicate report files being produced for the report clients (MSU/Audit/TIP
(POLMI)).
e Avoid re-creating transient objects and data in case of a re-start.
The DRS TWS schedule must be run once for each calendar day’. DRS records the Current
Working Day in the database in order to ensure that a process is not run twice or not skipped in
the event of fail-over from one data centre to the other.
' ETS schedule items where distinct from NBS are included in the NBS schedule

Note that DRS no longer processes any input transaction data - it executes its schedules daily
and will continue to do so until its transaction store is empty/archived. Following that it will be
removed from existence during Belfast data centre decommissioning.

DCS C2 transaction parts are copied from the DRS by the TES Host application over a database
link - this feed no longer contains any transaction data.
NBS C4/D transaction parts are copied from the TES Host application over a database link.
These transactions are written directly into the DRS C4/D daily main and daily main exception
tables. This interface is devoid of any transaction data
The Account Week and Client Information are input into DRS from RDDS. The data is copied
over a unique database link from DRS to RDDS database.
The DRS produces a number of ASCII Text Reconciliation Reports which are both collected by
the SSC and also delivered to POL via PODG
The Network Banking and Debit Card transactions stored in DRS database are sent to the Audit
Server in Archive format.
The DRS Workstation accesses the DRS database for MSU On-line Queries.
Within DRS Host the transaction parts C12, C4, D are first stored in XML format as received from
the Agents.
Next, the DRS Parse and Load Process parses, validates and loads the data into a set of Daily
Input tables. These tables are transient and are emptied every day. Any transaction parts which
fail the validation are stored in Daily Exceptions tables.
At S60 new functionality required the Receipt Date to be correctly set on DCS C4/D transaction
parts derived from HMS EMIS files. The full requirements are defined in Design Proposal
EF/DES/009 and implemented in schedule DRS_EFT_C4_RCPTD.
Finally, the DRS Match and Merge Process reads the Daily Input and Exceptions tables and
moves the matched and merged data into a permanent storage called DRS Main Store. The data
in DRS Main Store is kept for a configurable number of days currently set to 91 days.

All the Reconciliation Reports and MSU On-line Queries access data from DRS Main Store. The
Reconciliation Reports and MSU On-line Queries also make use of the reference data copied
from TPS and RDDS.
At S90, a new flag is introduced to C12 and C2 message parts to allow the agent payment file
generation process to distinguish Bureau transactions from sale transactions. Additionally, two
new transaction types will be introduced to support Bureau settlement. Further details of the S90
release changes are documented in HLD NB/HLD/026.
2 Installation
2.1 Environment Variables
All the DRS environment variable names and values are present in the “/home/drs/.vars” file.
When a DRS user logs in, all the variables are "exported" so that they become available to the
DRS executables.
The following table lists the name and values of all the environment variables used by DRS.
The “Accessed by” column in the table below indicates that this directory is accessed by another
application through NFS to move the data in and out of DRS. The details of the data access will
be specified in the IPDU Main Host Platform Specification or the relevant Application
Specification/User Guide.

e Host Administrator/DBA (ISD) will create a Unix user account. Also, they will create an Oracle
account (OPS$<Unix User Name>) in the DRS database. The Oracle account will be
identified "externally". That is, no explicit password will be assigned to the Oracle account.

« Host Administrator/DBA (ISD) will grant SECURITY_MANAGER role to the newly created
Oracle account. The SECURITY_MANAGER role already exists in the DRS database.

For example, the SQL commands to create an Oracle user account for the Unix user "arrism" and
grant the required role are:

(Connect to DRS database as the Oracle user "sys" or a user with DBA privileges)

SQL> create user ops$arrism identified externally
default tablespace USER_TABLESPACE temporary tablespace TEMP;
SQL> grant SECURITY_MANAGER to ops$arrism;

2.5.3.2 DRS Workstation User Account Setup
The procedure for DRS Workstation user account setup is as follows:

e MSU/SSC will fill the application form as defined in SVM/SEC/PRO/0006 (Application for
Access to the Live Network) to create a new Oracle account in the DRS database.

« The DRS Workstation Security Manager will create the DRS Workstation user account by
running a Unix shell script. The script will also create the necessary Oracle synonyms and
grant user the privileges to access the DRS database.

e The Security Manager will confirm to user that account has been created along with
password to use for first logon (the user will automatically be forced to change this).

The steps required by the Security Manager to create a DRS Workstation user are as follows:
e Login to the Host as Security Manager Unix user.

e Execute the following command on the Unix prompt (the shell script is present in the directory
"/app_sw/drs/sh" but the directory has been included in the PATH):

create_drs_workstation_user.sh <Oracle_User_Name> <Oracle_User_Password>

Where the <Oracle_User_Name>
- must start with the letters DRSWKSNWB for Network Banking users and
DRSWKSEFT for Debit Card Project users.
- canbe up to 30 characters long and should contain only letters and numbers.
The <Oracle_User_Password>
- must be at least 6 chars long.
- must be a mixture of alphanumeric characters i.e. a mixture of letters and numbers
(must contain at least 1 char in the range a-z,A-Z and 1 char in the range 0-9).
- must not have two consecutive characters the same.
- cannot be the same as the username.

The successful execution of the script displays a number of messages on the standard output.
The exit code of the shell script must be 0 (After running the script, check the exit code using the
command echo $?).

2.5.4 DRS Workstation User Account Closure

The procedure for DRS Workstation user account closure is as follows:

e MSU/SSC will fill in the account closure application form as defined in SVM/SEC/PRO/0006.

e {SD will lock the user account using the following commands:

(Login to the Host as Security Manager Unix user)
sqiplus /
SQL> alter user <Oracle_User_Name> account lock;
SQL> quit;

2.5.5 I DRS Workstation User Account Unlocking

The DRS will lock MSU/SSC Oracle user accounts following 3 unsuccessful logon attempts. In

the event of this

¢ Call will be raised with ISD.

e ISD will unlock the account. If the password has been forgotten, it will be reset and the
account status will be set to "password expired"(to force password change on first use). The
procedure for unlocking the account and/or resetting the password follows:

(Login to the Host as Security Manager Unix user)
sqlplus /
SQL> alter user <Oracle_User_Name> account unlock;
SQL> alter user <Oracle_User_Name> identified by <Temporary_Password>;
SQL> alter user <Oracle_User_Name> password expire;
SQL> quit;

e Confirmation will be sent by ISD to the user that the account has been unlocked along with
temporary password to use (the user will automatically be forced to change this at the first
logon).

details of the current and the estimated transaction volumes are available in PA/PER/033. The
details of the sizing analysis for the DRS database are available in DES/APP/HLD/0108
As described in DES/APP/HLD/0108, the DRS database can handle Phase-2 ‘Design-Limit’
volumes of 4.45 million (combined) Network Banking, Debit Card and Electronic Top-Up
transactions. Further, to handle situations where all the transactions for a day are not harvested
until the following day, i.e., two days of transactions are harvested on a single day, the DRS
tables have been sized to handle up to 8.6 million transactions. Note: At HNG-X, the non-
harvesting of transactions is not possible since the TWS Schedule dependencies will not allow it.
The storage required for the DRS Main Store table, which keeps the data online for up to 91
days, has been estimated as follows:
Measure Value
Peak daily transactions (Contract Limit) 3,711,000
Peak daily transactions (Design Limit) 4,445,000
Number of Days for which the data is stored 91 Days
Average Main Store record size 460 bytes
Maximum Main Store record Size 767 bytes
Database Storage required for one day considering average daily transaction 3,711,000 * 767
volumes where each record is of maximum size

= 2.65GB
Storage allocated at BIS for one day's Main Store data 2000MB
Additional Storage required input/output, Report tables and indexes 136GB
Total Database size considering peak daily transaction volumes 2000MB * 91 days +

136GB

=314GB
5 Process Failure and Recovery
DRS Host processes can fail due to Oracle, Application or System errors. The various types of
error conditions leading to process failure and the possible recovery actions are common for most
processes and are listed below:
5.1 Automatic re-run by TWS
In some cases, if a process instance fails a recovery job is automatically started by TWS, which
effectively reruns the process instance once.
For example, TWS reruns a failed instance of C12 Parser. The auto rerun of an instance is done
only once. Subsequent failures on the same instance require manual intervention.
5.2 Failures due to Oracle Error
In case of Oracle failures such as ‘Object does not exist’ or ‘Insufficient Oracle privileges’ or
‘Insufficient Rollback segments’ or ‘Unable to access database links’ and others, an Operational
Exception is logged in the DRS Operational Exceptions table along with the SQL statement that
caused the failure.

Please refer to Oracle message manual (or “oerr ORA ####" from a command prompt) for advice
on the appropriate recovery action for all such failures.

5.3 Failures due to Application and System Error

In case of Application errors such as invalid reference data or reference data does not exist, an
exception to indicate process failure is raised and recorded in the DRS Operational Exceptions
table which would be highlighted IBM Tivoli Monitoring.

In case of System errors such as errors related to the Operating System please refer to the
Operating System manual for advice on the appropriate recovery.

All DRS processes can be restarted after rectifying the cause of failure.

6 Network Banking Schedule Details

The Network Banking TWS Schedule includes network banking specific jobs and the jobs which
are common (like Reference Data Copy) between Network Banking and Debit Card.

For each job in the schedule, a brief description is included along with implementation details, Job
dependencies (if any) and Rerun action in case of a failure.

Implementation includes the Job name as used in the TWS Schedule. Full details of the Jobs
including the command-line parameters being passed can be found in DES/APP/HLD/0091

6.1 Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_NWB_SOD

This is the start of the DRS Network Banking schedule. It will start after the database restart on
completion of cold backup at around 8am.

6.1.1. Dependencies

Follows successful completion of the DRS Network Banking schedule for the previous logical
processing day (implemented via a dependency on existence of the
DRS_NWB_BATCH_COMPLETE.FLAG).

Precedes schedules DRS_RDDS_EXTRACT, DRS_TIDY_ORA, DRS_NWB_ANALYZE,
DRS_NWB_C12_PARS, DRS_ETU_CALD.

6.1.2. Process DRSC350

Process DRSC350 runs at the start of the DRS Network banking day to set the working day for
the schedule, create the Main Store (DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE) partition for that working
day and re-set various flags.

The DRS working day is controlled by two logical dates that are stored as “DRS SYSTEM DATE”
and “PARTITION RECEIPT DATE” system parameters for the Application Type "NWB" in the
database. These dates normally correspond to the System Date on the Rig with the exception of
a post fail-over catch-up situation where the dates could lag by one or more days.

DRSC350 will also perform partition maintenance on the NBS C2 tables. New partitions are
created and old partitions dropped. The DRS_NRT_INTERFACE_METADATA table is updated to
reflect the partition state of each C2 output table.

FUJ00234963

6.1.2.1 Implementation
Implemented in the M_DB_SRV#DRSC350N job (postfix "N" stands for Network Banking).

6.1.2.2 Job Dependencies

This job is dependent on the TWS resource DRS350LK. This is necessary so that DRSC350N
and DRSC350E do not run at the same time. This resource has a value of 1 and will hold up the
running of DRSC350N until it is available. DRSC350E has the same dependency.

6.1.2.3 Rerun action

The common process failure scenarios and rerun actions are described in the section Process
Failure and Recovery

Additionally, a migration specific Application error could occur in the form of process failure when
run for the first time on the Rig. The reason for such an error could be missing values for “DRS
SYSTEM DATE” and “PARTITION RECEIPT DATE” system parameters in
DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS table. These parameters are created with NULL values as a part
of DRS database and schema build and must be set by ISD to the value of Unix System Date one
day prior to running the schedule for the first time. The details of how to set these dates in
DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS table are available in the DRS Delivery Handover Note.

The process can be restarted after rectifying the cause of failure.

Note that it is possible due to the unavoidable implicit database commit performed when
adding/dropping table partitions that, in some esoteric failure scenarios, the partition metadata will
be out of sync with the actual partitions. In this situation, re-running the SOD process will
potentially fail.

In this scenario it will be necessary to confirm whether the metadata/partitions are inconsistent by
running a script provided by development.

If the partitions/metadata are inconsistent it will be necessary to manipulate either to remedy the
situation. Given that the remedial activity will be dependent on a number of variables including
whether any data has been written to the new partitions etc, a call should be raised with 4" line
support.

In some situations, typically in test, it is desirable to run DRSC350 more than once in a calendar
day. The default (build) value of the PROCESS_DAY_MULTIPLE_RUNS_YN flag in the
DRS_PROCESSES table for the DRSC350 process is ‘N’ so would prevent this. Therefore the
PROCESS_DAY_MULTIPLE_RUNS_YN flag should be changed to ‘Y’ to allow this if required.

WARNING - This should only be done in Live at the guidance of development or support.

6.2 Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_TIDY_ORA

The schedule runs a script to tidy files associated with the Oracle database. This activity is not
solely applicable to Network Banking, but for convenience is scheduled to run after the Network
Banking Start Of Day schedule.

6.2.1. Dependencies
Follows successful completion of the schedule DRS_NWB_SOD.

6.3 Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_ETU_C4LD

The schedule runs DRSC305 to load the ETU file containing C4/D messages into the NWB C4SD
input table and then DRSC306 to parse the C4/D messages into the C4/D daily main tables.

6.3.1 Dependencies

Follows successful completion of the schedules DRS_NWB_SOD and
DRS_ETU_BATCH_COMPLETE.FLAG.

6.3.2. Process DRSC305

This process reads [C4/D] XML records from a data-file whose absolute filename is passed to it
on command-line by TWS and loads them into the FTMS_RX_NWB_C4SD input table.

The input data-file/s are read from directory $NWB_NBE_INPUT and are renamed to change
their extension to lowercase once they have been successfully processed.

This schedule precedes the schedule DRS_NWB_MS_EXCPTN.
6.9.2 Process DRSC310 [NIGHT]
The ‘NIGHT’ run of the DRSC310 process picks up all the transaction parts for processing which
have Receipt Date less than or equal to the current Partition Receipt Date. The value of current
Partition Receipt Date is derived from DRS System Parameter "PARTITION RECEIPT DATE" for
the Application Type "NWB" [refer to System Parameters for details].
This process reads the transaction parts [C12/ C4/S/D] from Daily Input tables
[DRS_RX_NWB_C12, DRS_RX_NWB_C4, DRS_RX_NWB_D and DRS_RX_NWB SJ in the
order of their arrival sequence in DRS. No [S] transactions are expected for Network Banking.
The transaction parts are matched on necessary elements and the State Information is derived
and set in chronological order once for the arrival of each transaction part. The resulting
transaction record containing all the available transaction parts and the State Information is then
inserted into DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE table. The process also inserts a copy of Main Store
record into DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES table where the transaction part(s) had
the Receipt Date less than the current Partition Receipt Date to facilitate fast reporting.
Multiple instances of the process can be run in parallel. Each instance can process a set number
of Daily Input table partitions.

6.10.2 Process DRSC311
The purpose of this module is to merge those DRS Transaction parts [C112, C12, D, C4, S] that
are in exception with the corresponding DRS main exception tables. No [S] transactions are
expected for Network Banking.
Only one instance of the program must be run at any time. Multiple instances could result in
duplicate rows being inserted into the main exception tables.
All the transaction parts that have the value of Receipt Date less than or equal to the current
Partition Receipt Date are processed. The value of current Partition Receipt Date is derived from
DRS System Parameter "PARTITION RECEIPT DATE" for the Application Type "NWB". The
record is validated to check it exists in the Main Store (DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE) and the
current state of the transaction part in exception is derived or copied from the main store.
After a record has been successfully processed and inserted into the Exceptions Main table, the
PROCESSED_YN flag for the corresponding record in Daily Exceptions table is set to ‘Y’.

6.16.2.3. Rerun action
The common process failure scenarios and rerun actions are described in the section Process
Failure and Recovery.
6.17 Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_COMPLETE
This schedule contains a job that creates the Network Banking and Debit Card schedule
completion flags. These flags are used by TWS to determine successful logical completion of the
processing.
The schedule and job details have been provided by the TWS Development team.
6.17.1.1 I Job Dependencies
DRS_BACKUP.DRS_DB_START, DRS_FS_BACKUP.DRSF_CLONE_SPLIT_S.
7 Debit Card Schedule Details
This section describes all the Schedules and Jobs listed in Appendix B — Debit Card TWS
Schedule. The Debit Card TWS Schedule includes just the Debit Card specific jobs and NOT the
jobs which are common (like Reference Data Copy) between Network Banking and Debit Card.
For each job in the schedule, a brief description is included along with implementation details, Job
dependencies (if any) and Rerun action in case of a failure.
Implementation includes the Job name as used in the TWS Schedule. Full details of the Jobs
including the command-line parameters being passed can be found in Appendix B — Debit Card
TWS Schedule.
7.1. Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_EFT_SOD
This is the start of the DRS Debit Card schedule. It will start after the database restart on
completion of BCV Split at around 8am.
7.1.1. Dependencies
Follows successful completion of the DRS Debit Card schedule for the previous logical
processing day (implemented via a dependency on DRS_EFT_BATCH_COMPLETE.FLAG).
Precedes schedules DRS_RDDS_EXTRACT, DRS_EFT_ANALYZE, DRS_EFT_C12_PARS.
7.1.2 Process DRSC350
Process DRSC350 runs at the start of the DRS Debit Card day to set the working day for the
schedule, create the Main Store (DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE) partition for that working day
and re-set various flags.
The DRS working day is controlled by two logical dates that are stored as “DRS SYSTEM DATE”
and “PARTITION RECEIPT DATE” system in the database. There are two sets of logical dates -
one for NWB and EFT each. These dates normally correspond to the System Date on the Rig

with the exception of a post fail-over catch-up situation where the dates could lag by one or more
days.

7.1.2.1 Implementation
Implemented in the M_DB_SRV#DRSC350E job (the postfix "E" stands for Debit Card/EFTPoS).

7.1.2.2 Job Dependencies

This job is dependent on the TWS resource DRS350LK. This is necessary so that DRSC350N
and DRSC350E do not run at the same time. This resource has a value of 1 and will hold up the
running of DRSC350E until it is available. DRSC350N has the same dependency.

7.1.2.3. Rerun action

The common process failure scenarios and rerun actions are described in the section 5-Process
Failure and Recovery.

Additionally, a migration specific Application error could occur in the form of process failure when
run for the first time on the Rig. The reason for such an error could be missing values for “DRS
SYSTEM DATE” and “PARTITION RECEIPT DATE” system parameters in
DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS table. These parameters are created with NULL values as a part
of DRS database and schema build and must be set by ISD to the value of Unix System Date one
day prior to the running the BI3 schedule for the first time. The details of how to set these dates in
DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS table are available in the DRS Delivery Handover Note.

The process can be restarted after rectifying the cause of failure.

Note that it is possible due to the unavoidable implicit database commit performed when
adding/dropping table partitions that, in some esoteric failure scenarios, the partition metadata will
be out of sync with the actual partitions. In this situation, re-running the SOD process will
potentially fail.

In this scenario it will be necessary to confirm whether the metadata/partitions are inconsistent by
running a script provided by development.

If the partitions/metadata are inconsistent it will be necessary to manipulate either to remedy the
situation. Given that the remedial activity will be dependent on a number of variables including
whether any data has been written to the new partitions etc, a call should be raised with 4" line
support.

In some situations, typically in test, it is desirable to run DRSC350 more than once in a calendar
day. The default (build) value of the PROCESS_DAY_MULTIPLE_RUNS_YN flag in the
DRS_PROCESSES table for the DRSC350 process is ‘N’ so would prevent this. Therefore the
PROCESS_DAY_MULTIPLE_RUNS_YN flag should be changed to ‘Y’ to allow this if required.

WARNING - This should only be done in Live at the guidance of development or support.

7.2. Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_EFT_ANALYZE

The schedule runs a job every day to gather the statistics for specified DRS database objects.
The statistics are used by Oracle optimiser to improve the query performance.

loads them into the DRS_RX_EFT_{C4ID} and DRS_RX_EFT_{C4ID}_EXCP tables respectively
for Debit Card.

TWS invokes eight instances of DRSC302 at the start of the schedule.

The process polls the C12-Input table at periodic intervals after a pause whose duration in
seconds is taken from the value of “C4SD PAUSE WAIT LIMIT” system parameter.

The process execution is controlled by the value of system parameter “C4SD FILE LOAD
COMPLETE” for the Application Type “EFT”. The parameter value is set to “N” by process
DRSC306 on successful completion of all C4SD file load jobs and this would result in all eight
instances of DRSC302 to exit after processing the last set of records from the C4/D input table.

7.8 Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_EFT_MS_NIGHT
This schedule runs DRS Main Store Processing (DRSC310) as “batch-overnight” to process all
the transaction parts [C12/C112/C4/D/S] received in DRS since the last run of the schedule. The
same process DRSC310 is also used as part of the daily schedule. See section Error!
Reference source not found. for details.
7.8.1 Dependencies
This schedule follows the successful completion of the schedule DRS_EFT_C4_RCPTD and
DRS_EFT_SOB.
This schedule precedes the schedule DRS_EFT_MS_EXPTN.
7.8.2 Process DRSC310 [NIGHT]
The ‘NIGHT’ run of the DRSC310 process picks up all the transaction parts for processing which
have Receipt Date less than or equal to the current Partition Receipt Date. The value of current
Partition Receipt Date is derived from DRS System Parameter “PARTITION RECEIPT DATE” for
the Application Type “EFT” [refer to System Parameters for details].
This process reads the transaction parts [C12/C112/C4/S/D] from Daily Input tables
[DRS_RX_EFT_C12, DRS_RX_EFT_C112, DRS_RX_EFT_C4, DRS_RX_EFT.D and
DRS_RX_EFT_S for Debit Card] in the order of their arrival sequence in DRS. The transaction
parts are matched on necessary elements and the State Information is derived and set in
chronological order once for the arrival of each transaction part. The resulting transaction record
containing all the available transaction parts and the State Information is then inserted into
DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE table. The process also inserts a copy of Main Store record into
DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES table where the transaction part(s) had the Receipt
Date less than the current Partition Receipt Date to facilitate fast reporting.
Multiple instances of the process can be run in parallel. Each instance can process a set number
of Daily Input table partitions.
7.8.2.1 Implementation
This process has been implemented in M_DB_SRV#DRSC310EN_x, where x is the instance
number ranging from 1 to 8 and the postfix “EN” stands for Debit Card/EFTPoS and Night.

7.9 Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_EFT_MS_EXPTN

This schedule runs DRSC311, which copies records from the daily exception tables into the
corresponding main store exception tables and sets the appropriate State for the records.

7.9.1 Dependencies
This schedule follows the successful completion of the schedule DRS_EFT_MS_NIGHT.

Precedes the schedules DRS_RDDS_EXTRACT. It also precedes DRS_EFT_REP_101,
DRS_EFT_REP_102 but these dependencies are not exercised.

7.9.2 Process DRSC311

The purpose of this module is to copy the DRS Transaction parts [C112, C12, D, C4 and S] that
are in exception from the Daily Exception tables [DRS_RX_EFT_{C12IC112IC4IDIS}_EXCP] to
the corresponding Exception Main tables [DRS_RX_EFT_{C12IC112IC4IDIS}_EXCP_MAIN].

Only one instance of the program must be run at any time. Multiple instances could result in
duplicate rows being inserted into the Exception Main tables.

On the pattern of DRS Main Store processing (DRSC310), only those exceptions are processed
that have the value of Receipt Date less than or equal to the current Partition Receipt Date. The
value of current Partition Receipt Date is derived from DRS System Parameter “PARTITION
RECEIPT DATE” for the Application Type “EFT”. The record is validated to check it exists in the
Main Store (DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE] table and the current state of the transaction part in
exception is either derived or copied from the Main Store table.

After a record has been successfully processed and inserted into the Exceptions Main table, the
PROCESSED_YN flag for the corresponding record in Daily Exception table is set to ‘Y’.

7.11 Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_EFT_REP_102

The generation of DRS NB102 reconciliation report for Debit Card involves three functional steps:
1. Population of Intermediate tables DRS_REP_EFT_STATE_TOTALS (process DRSC320).

2. Population of Result tables DRS_REP_EFT_RESULTS_NB102_1...12 (process DRSC323).
3. Producing the report text files on the Host operating system (process DRSC325).

The jobs in this schedule perform the above-mentioned three steps.

This Schedule is run daily after the successful completion of NB101 reconciliation reports.

7.11.1 Dependencies

Follows after successful completion of schedule DRS_EFT_MS_EXPTN and
DRS_RDDS_EXTRACT.

Precedes the Network Banking schedule DRS REP_000.

The data is extracted from the DRS Main Store (DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE) Exceptions Main
(DRS_RX_EFT_{C12IC112IC4ISID}_EXCP_MAIN) and the State Totals
(DRS_REP_EFT_STATE_TOTALS) tables and inserted into DRS NB102 Results tables.

The process runs once for each section. To reduce the overall run time, the multiple instances of
the process are run in parallel, where possible. The sections 1, 6, 7 and 12 are run sequentially —
one after the other but the sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 are run in parallel.

7.12.2 Process DRSC361
The purpose of this module is to Archive Control, Data and Report tables to Support and Audit
requirements and Archive/Purge Data and Report tables older than the Retention period for
Archive server. The archive files stored under Archive server are for future references. The old
data is cleared to make space for the new data. Entries from the table
DRS_ARCHIVED_TABLES are used for archive parameters and criteria. The records that go into
this table are also present in the form of a spreadsheet in Appendix F — DRS Archiving Table
Mapping.
This module uses Oracle Export/Import method to archive data as specified in the DRS High
Level Design DES/APP/HLD/0033.
Only one instance of the program must be run at any time. Multiple instances at the same time
could result in corrupt export dump files being created.
If the data purge process fails due to the process not being able to get exclusive access to the
table to purge, an exception is raised and it continues to the next table. The next time the purge
process is run it will purge two days’ worth of data. Some of the tables (like the daily tables) can
only hold around three days’ worth of data, so three failures in a row will give problems.

8.1 Common Tables
All DRS tables that are used to store non-transactional data are common to both Network
Banking and Debit Card/EFTPoS applications. These include tables for storing system
parameters, process control, audit and various file register tables.
Most common tables have a column named APPLICATION_TYPE, which can be mandatory or
optional depending on the type of table. Notable exclusions are tables associated with
housekeeping tasks such as partition management and archiving. If the application type is
mandatory, it is a part of the key for the table and its value is derived from the Application-Type
command-line input parameter that is passed to the process. If the application type is non-
mandatory, it will be used only for records that are Application specific. The two
APPLICATION_TYPE values used are ‘EFT’ for Debit Card Transactions and ‘NWB’ for Network
Banking Transactions and ETU Transactions.
Refer to Appendix D — DRS Tables for a brief description of all common DRS tables.
8.2 System Parameters
The System Parameters are configurable parameters stored in DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMTERS
table. One set of System Parameters is stored for Network Banking (NWB) and Debit Card (EFT)
each. The table below lists all the System Parameters currently used by DRS.
Name App I Data-type _I Description
DRS SYSTEM DATE NWB DATE The current date that the DRS system is working for.

&EFT The program DRSC360 at the start of each day updates

the parameter by incrementing its value by 1 day.

Before the DRS logical processing day starts, this

parameter will have the value of the preceding day. E.g.

at 7am (or before execution of DRSC350) on the 27" of

June 2002, this parameter will have the value “26" June

2002”.

The parameter value is set to NULL after DRS baseline

installation. It is expected to be set to TRUNC

(SYSDATE) on the day prior to running the DRS schedule

for the first time.
PARTITION RECEIPT I NWB& I DATE Indicates the Receipt Date that the most recent partition
DATE EFT in the DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE table will hold

transactions for.

The program DRSC350 at the start of each day updates

the parameter by incrementing its value by 1 day.

Normally its value should match the value of parameter

“DRS SYSTEM DATE”.

Before the DRS logical processing day starts, this

parameter will have the value of parameter “DRS

SYSTEM DATE”.

The parameter value is set to NULL after DRS baseline

installation. Itis expected to be set to TRUNC

(SYSDATE) on the day prior to running the DRS schedule

for the first time.
DRS C4SD INPUT NWB& I NUMBER Indicates the number of partitions for the table
PARTITIONS EFT FTMS_RX_NWB_C4SD. This value is used by DRSC302

process to derive the next partition number to be

processed.

8.3 DRS Tables
The DRS tables can be divided into three categories:
8.3.1 Static Data Tables
Static data tables store reference-type information that is used by Host Processes and DRS
Workstation.
All static data tables have a column named APPLICATION_TYPE to show whether the reference
data is to be used for Network Banking (NWB), Debit Card (EFT) or both. This column could be
mandatory or nullable depending upon the type of data stored in a static data table. If the column
is nullable, just one set of values is stored in the table and the APPLICATION_TYPE column is
set only for the records that are specific to an APPLICATION_TYPE. For example,

DRS Host Support Guide

Pe)
FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

FUJ00234963
FUJ00234963

APPLICATION_TYPE column is nullable in DRS_PROCESSES table, which stores the details of
the DRS processes. APPLICATION_TYPE column in this table is populated only for the
processes specific to Network Banking or Debit Card. For common processes,
APPLICATION_TYPE column is not populated in DRS_PROCESSES table.

lf the APPLICATION_TYPE column is mandatory and a part of the Unique/Primary Key
constraint, common records in the table are repeated for each application type. For example,
APPLICATION_TYPE column is mandatory in DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS table which stores
details of the System Parameters. This table stores all common System Parameters twice, that is,
once for each application type.

8.3.2 Control/Registry Data Tables

The DRS database has a single set (as opposed to two sets of transaction tables) of tables that
store Control and Registry Information. The control records for both Network Banking and Debit
Card are stored in the same table and are distinguished by the value in APPLICATION_TYPE
column, which forms a part of the Unique/Primary key for the table. Examples of such tables
include DRS_REP_FILE_REGISTER, DRS_C4SD_FILE_REGISTER,
DRS_PROCESS_CONTROL etc.

8.3.3. Transaction Data Tables

The DRS has two sets of transaction data tables one for Network Banking and one for Debit
Card. Each set has a 3-letter acronym in the table name to show which application type the table
belongs to. The Network Banking tables use “NWB” and the Debit Card tables use the “EFT”
acronym. The tables storing similar transactional data for Networking Banking and Debit Card
reside in the same tablespace. For example, DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES and
DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES tables store updates to the old Network Banking
transactions and reside in the tablespace DRS_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES.

The DRS has two sets of Oracle users one for Network Banking and one for Debit Card. These
users access the transaction data tables through a set of private synonyms. From example,
DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES table is accessed through a private synonym named
DRS_RX_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES for the Oracle users “OPS$DRSNWB" = and
“OPS$DRSNWB1...8". Similarly, DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES table is accessed
through a private synonym named DRS_RX_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES for the Oracle users
“OPS$DRSEFT” and “OPS$DRSEFT1...8”. The names of the private synonyms are same for
both the sets of Oracle users.

9 Files Created/Used

9.1 Input and Output Data Files

The input data files contain [C4/D/S] messages in XML format received from the Network Banking
Engine (for Network Banking) or Merchant Acquirer (for Debit Card). The input files containing [S]
messages are received for Debit Card only.

The output data files contain [C2] messages in XML format and are sent to Merchant Acquirer
through DCP C2-Bulk File Agent. The output files containing [C2] messages are created for Debit
Card only.

9.2.1.1 MSU Report Files

These files contain NBOOO (for Network Banking only), NB101, NB102 and NB103 Reconciliation
Reports for MSU (Management Support Unit). The files are produced daily (with the exception of
NB103 which is weekly), one for each routing gateway and currency type. Electronic Top-Ups are
reported through the Network Banking reports as a unique routing gateway. Also, a Unix link of
these files is created in the TIP (POLMI) and/or Audit directories, where necessary.

TWS copies these report files from the Host to the MIS Workstation. Audit Server copies the
report files by running its own script. In the future there will be a staging server that the files will
be copied to, then the MSU Workstation can then access these files via this staging server.

The old report files (*.TXT) are deleted after a configurable number of days by DRS File Purge
job (DRSX362.sh).

The file names and storage location are as follows:

<TxnGroup> Transaction Group. NB103 use ‘WDR' (Withdrawals) or ‘DEP’
(Deposits). NBOOO, NB101 and NB102 use 'N_A’.

<Currency> Currency. NB101, NB102 and NB103 use a value passed from
the database, usually ‘GBP’ or ‘EUR’. The currency is substituted
by ‘N_A’ if not found for the report. NBOOO uses ‘N_A’.

10 Support Usage of Archive/Support Export
Files

DRS Archive/Support files for Network Banking and Debit Card are created in the form of
compressed Oracle Export database dumps. For details on the naming conventions, file locations
and the file contents, refer to the sections 9.3 and Appendix F — DRS Archiving Table Mapping.

The compressed Oracle export file formats have been chosen to facilitate transport of these files
to multiple environments and ease of loading. Additionally, as the data will be sufficiently
compacted, the disk usage and transfer time will less. Note that these files are not meant for
restoring the state of tables in Live. The Live Backup and Restores are discussed in Section 11.

FUJ00234963
FUJ00234963

The Archive/Support files can be loaded by Support on a separate DRS Support environment.
This would typically be a machine running the same Host operating system and version of Oracle
as Live. The support rig must have all Host work packages that have been applied to Live. Also,
the size of the DRS database must match that of Live for all tablespaces with the exception of the
Main Store partition tablespaces.

The following steps should be followed to use the Archive/Support files on the Support rig:
e Copy the compressed Archive/Support file/s to the “/loadarea’” directory on the Support rig.
e Uncompress the file/s

e Delete all existing records from the target table/s in order to ensure no Primary Key violations
occur and that there is sufficient space in the target tablespace

e If importing the Main Store table (DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE), drop the table and use
import to create the table with the required partition name

e Use the Oracle 8.1.7 Import Utility “imp” to load the contents of the file into target tables. In
addition to the mandatory parameters like USERID and FILE, it is recommended that the
following parameters are used to minimise chances of failure:

BUFFER = 44000000

IGNORE = Y

COMMIT = Y

FROMUSER = OPS$DRS

TOUSER = OPS$DRS

FILE = <Name of the database dump file>
TABLES = <List of tables being imported>

11 Backup and Recovery

11.1 Backup

The DRS backups use the RMAN utility provided by Oracle to take full and incremental backups
daily.

The backup strategy enables a full database copy including archive logs to disk on a Sunday. The
incremental backup is taken from Monday to Saturday. The backups are kept on disks for up to 7
days before been deleted. The backup schedule is defined by the application designer following
the guidelines specified in DES/SYM/HLD/0016, but is expected to be along the following lines:

Following the completion of the Network Banking and Debit Card end of day schedules, and all
other database jobs have completed, the DRS backups are implemented by the DRS_BACKUP
and DRS_FS_BACKUP schedules. Running as full or incremental depending on the day of the
week.

FUJ00234963
FUJ00234963

In case of failure, the DRS processes rollback changes made to the database wherever possible
before exiting and/or make use of the Process Control to save the last successful restart point.

Dependencies have been defined in the schedule, which disallows TWS from running processes
that are dependent on the failed process this ensuring data integrity. The failed process is then
re-run by the TWS scheduler after a predefined time gap (with manual intervention). In case of
multiple restart points in a process, program logic is used to start from the latest restart point.

11.2.2 System Failure

If the operating system crashes or there is an Oracle Instance failure during the DRS processing
day, it is possible to restart DRS from the point of failure. This is because the DRS database will
be run in ‘Archive-Log' mode.

Once the system is re-started, standard Oracle recovery process would apply all committed
transactions which have not been saved earlier, to the database through the use of redo-log
buffers and rollback segments in a process called “roll forward and back”. For more information
refer to the Oracle Administrators Guide for version 8.1.7.

The TWS scheduler records the process name that was being executed when the crash
occurred. As in the case of Process Failure, the schedule will need to be manually restarted from
the process that has failed.

11.2.3. Media Failure

In case of a media or disk failure, Oracle may not be able to save / read data from the disk. This
could happen due to a number of causes but as the DRS database is running in ‘Archive-log’
mode, it is possible to restart from a point in time prior to the failure in the DRS processing day.
This can be achieved by restoring the previous consistent database backup from the BCV (refer
to Section 11.1) and using the archived and online redo-log files to recover to a point of time just
prior to the media failure.

Successful database recovery from a media failure should be followed by schedule re-start from
the point of failure for the Network Banking/Debit Card and other connected systems.

It is not envisaged that a part of the schedule would need to be rerun as the restore using online
and archived redo-logs is expected to recover the database to its state prior to the failure and the
incomplete DRS processes could be restarted. However if there is a need for schedule rerun,
refer to Section 14.

If database cannot be restored with the above procedure, refer to Appendix B of doc ref:
DEV/APP/SPG/0028 for restore procedure. This will restore database back to the latest
point when database crash occurred and the archivelogs will be restored.

12 External System Failures/Restarts

This section lists the external systems that interface with DRS and discusses the most common
failure scenarios and how DRS can recover from them. For an exhaustive description of Failure
Scenarios and Recovery, please refer to DES/APP/IFS/0006.

12.1 RDDS Host Database Failure

FUJ00234963
FUJ00234963

lf a RDDS Host database failure occurs before the execution of the RDDS-to-DRS copy process
(DRSC364), a TWS dependency makes DRS wait for RDDS to be backed up again before
allowing the DRSC364 process to run.

lf a RDDS Host database failure occurs during the execution of the RDDS-to-DRS copy process
(DRSC364), the process is likely to fail and log one/more Operational Exceptions to record the
error details. Once RDDS database is back up again, the process can be rerun.

12.2 TES Host Database Failure

A TES Host database failure would result in the C4/D transactions not arriving. One or more of
the TES owned TES_AL_REC_RUN/TES_CAPO_REC_RUN/ TES_LINK_REC_RUN schedules
would not complete due to DRSC371 failing which will result in all the DRS batch overnight
schedules being held up.

Once the failure is resolved and the preceding TES processes have completed, the DRS batch
overnight jobs will start execution.

Because of the dependencies within the DRS schedule, there would be a corresponding delay in
the completion of TPS-Host batch overnight.

12.3 TWS File Transfer Failure

TWS scripts transfer the MSU Reports to MSU using NFS mounted host directory
(/ovnw01/drs/trans/drsmsu) on the SSC Server. Another set of scripts transfer the DRS Support
and Archive files to the SSC Archive Server again via NFS mounted Host directories
(/ovnw01/drs/trans/drssupport and /bvnw01/drs/trans/drsarchive).

Failure in transferring files to the MSU/SSC Archive may result in some/all of the files not being
transferred. This should not be an issue for Host processing and would not result in loss of data
as long as the file transfer mechanism is able to successfully transfer the files before the files are
deleted by DRS file housekeeping process.

The files would remain on the DRS-Host for MSU to request for manual transfer in case of
automatic transfer failures. Similarly the Support/Archive files can also be requested for a manual
transfer from the DRS-Host.

From Directories and Error! Reference source not found., space for 5 peak working days at
phase-2 volumes has been requested for the DRS Support and MSU-Report directories.

12.4 Audit Server File Transfer Failure

DRS creates Unix hard links for reconciliation reports and a compressed export of the oldest Main
Store partition in the DRS-Audit (/>vnw01/drs/trans/drsaudit) directory.

Failure in transferring files to the Audit Server may result in some/all of the files not being
transferred to the Audit Server. This should not be an issue for Host processing and would not
result in loss of data as long as the file transfer mechanism is able to successfully transfer the
files before the space allocated to the audit directory is exhausted or before the files are deleted
by Audit file housekeeping. From Directories and Error! Reference source not found., space for
5 peak working days at phase-2 volumes has been requested for the Audit directory.

13.1 Oracle Tuning
The following table indicates the tuning that has been done to the initTPS.ora parameter file:
Parameter Value Reason
DB_FILE_MULTIBLOCK_READ_COU I 16 Set to 1Mb, so that table scans are done as close as
NT possible to one extent against the partitioned main
store table and that full table scans are efficient
DB_FILES 600 Maximum number of database files that can be
opened for this database.
OPEN_CURSORS 400 Maximum number of open cursors a session can have
ata time.
DML_LOCKS 2048 Maximum number of DML locks — one for each table
modified in a transaction.
DB_BLOCK_BUFFERS 12800 Attempt to fetch large number of main store
transaction records into memory in order to improve
(100MB) performance
LOG_BUFFERS 163840 Size of the Redo Log Buffers
(16MB)
SORT_AREA SIZE 67108864 Allows the batch processes to sort large volumes of
(eam) transactions in memory
PARALLEL_MAX_SERVERS 80 Maximum number of Parallel Query Servers that can
be opened. Set to a high value to allow the various
multiple instance processes to execute parallel queries
PARALLEL_MIN_SERVERS 10 Minimum number of Parallel Query Servers that are
always open. Value has been set such that Oracle
does not need to open any parallel query servers while
the single instance processes (e.g. reports) are
running
PROCESSES 100 Maximum number of operating system user processes
that can simultaneously connect to Oracle.
TRANSACTIONS 64 Maximum number of Concurrent Transactions.
DISTRIBUTED_TRANSACTIONS 30 Maximum number of Concurrent Distributed
Transactions.
13.2 Schedule tuning
There are two ways to tune the schedule performance:
13.2.1. Schedule parallelism
Several parallel streams will run the load, parse and main store update jobs within the DRS
schedule (e.g. if eight streams are run, each stream will process on eighth of the total number of
partitions). The processes have been scheduled such that write to the same set of tables are not
run at the same time.
The parallelism needs to be tuned on a regular basis to take into account the changing volumes
and spread of data so that each activity can make maximum use of the computer configuration.

13.2.2 Resource pools

TWS has a facility to limit the number of jobs running that requires a particular resource, such as
a tape drive. These resource pools are user defined, and can be used to minimise contention.

DRS does not currently use TWS resource pools as the number of jobs running at any given time
is not considered high enough.

13.3 Main store partition tuning

The DRS Main Store tables for Network Banking and Debit Card have been partitioned on
Receipt Date and sub-partitioned on ‘hash’ of Horizon-Transaction-Id. Each partition (along with
its sub-partitions) has its own tablespace, which is spread across physical disks. This has been
done to improve query efficiency and is particularly beneficial for use in parallel queries.

13.4 SQL hint tuning

The Oracle Database Server supports a number of ‘hints’ to its optimiser which informs the
RDBMS at run time of access paths that have been found (through performance testing) to be the
most efficient path to use.

Bearing in mind that DRS is a new product and that the transaction spread may change over
time, the SQL hints used have been stored in a table named DRS_SQL_HINTS. Host processes
that expect to find SQL hints access this table to fetch and use the SQL hint. This has been
implemented to provide for ease of change.

For processes that access large tables, the hint “Parallel” can be/is used for SQL operations
doing fetches and performing sorts. This makes use of the multiple processors present on Host,
multiple parallel query servers possible due to the virtual memory available on the host and the
striping of the tablespaces’ data files across disks.

14 Re-run

DRS has been designed to automatically recover from a data centre failure. All programs will
restart at the point of failure regardless of whether the TWS schedule was recovered.

Since DRS maintains data for 91 days and the non-transient tables are updated on receipt of
each transaction part, it is not advisable to rerun part of the schedule that has been successfully
processed.

Priority listed against the exceptions in the following table stands for:

A - Business critical error. If ignored, would violate SLA with Post Office. The error should be fixed immediately / workaround be implemented to avoid violating the

SLA deadline.

B - Error condition but of medium priority. May/will cause the DRS schedule to be held up and should be resolved at the earliest on the same/in the next business day

after resolving exceptions of Priority A.
C - Low priority error conditions / warnings / information only messages. These should be looked onto after resolving all exceptions of A and B priorities.

X - Ignore. Exception is no longer in use or exception is not being generated.
