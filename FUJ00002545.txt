1. Service Summary

1.1. The Engineering Service comprises an on-site replacement or repair service, together with
associated backup, support and administrative functions, for Counter Equipment at Branches
and other designated Post Office locations, including CTOs or Head Office Counter Positions.
Where possible the Service Desk will provide resolution of Hardware faults, however any
Hardware faults which cannot be resolved will be passed to the Engineering Service to initiate
deployment of a Fujitsu Services Support Engineer with the exception of certain Bar Code
Reader calls whereby the Postmaster will have the option of selecting a postal fix which will be
managed via the Service Desk on behalf of Engineering Services.. Please see
(SVM/SDM/SD/0001) for details on process.

1.2. The Engineering Service shall comprise the following elements:
(a) On-site replacement of faulty Counter Equipment;
(b) Repair and recycling of faulty Counter Equipment;
(c) Limited Hardware asset tracking — base units only;
(d) Local Area Network (LAN) support;
(e) Portable Appliance Testing (PAT); and
(f) Service Management.

1.3. Fujitsu Services Support Engineers will be appropriately trained and the Engineering Service
shall include the use of Technical Couriers where Fujitsu Services considers it is appropriate
for such Technical Couriers to carry out the Engineering Service.

1.4. Maintenance and repair of the Counter Equipment involving on-site attendance at Post Office
premises by Fujitsu Services Support Engineers shall not interfere unduly with the ability of a
Branch to serve Customers, even where the Branch has only a single Counter Position and/or
extremely limited physical space.

Fujitsu Services shall carry out visits for maintenance or repair in accordance with the SLTs described
within section 2.3.5 of this Engineering Service, Service Description. However, the Branch Manager may
elect to defer a visit to a more convenient time and where practical it will be accommodated. For
example, in a larger Branch, if a fault occurs at the busiest time of day then the Branch Manager may
specify the earliest start time from which Fujitsu Services may carry out the maintenance or repair. In
such circumstances, the request for service shall be diagnosed fully but not carried out until after the
Branch Manager's preferred time of attendance. In this case the time in suspension shall not count
towards downtime as defined within section 2.3.5 of this Engineering Service, Service Description.

Table 1.

* Fujitsu have agreed to upgrade all counter printer calls to Urgency 1 at single counter branches as part
of a service improvement initiative.

Because of this, there shall be no detrimental effect to Fujitsu from an SLA perspective in offering this
uplift in service.

- If the incident is resolved within the timescales of an Urgency 1, Priority 1 logged call (4hrs to
fix) then it shall contribute to the associated peripheral Urgency 1 SLT.

- Should the incident not be resolved within 4hrs, but completed before the current contractual
SLA expires (End of Next Business Day) then the incident shall contribute to the Urgency 3 SLT

- Only in the event that a call is not completed by the end of the next working day will it count as
an SLA failure against the Urgency 3 SLT.

Whilst this is being introduced on a reasonable endeavours basis, Fujitsu will implement a KPI with their
suppliers that target them at achieving a 80% success rate for incidents that are subject to this uplift in
service.

alternative to sending the call to engineering. Where this service is requested by the Postmaster, the
replacement part is mailed to branch for the Postmaster to install themselves rather than by sending an
engineer. This is covered by CCN1301b. Assuming that the criteria laid out as per the CCN are met,
then each call which is resolved via this method rather than using the engineering service will invoke a
credit which will be paid to POL monthly at the level described at that time.

2.7.1.2 OBC (Branch Change) Service

The Engineering Service supports the OBC (Branch Change) Service. If the scope of the Engineering
Service changes, the alternative Service Provider will support the OBC (Branch Change) Service.
