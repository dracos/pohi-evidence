Dear Mandy,

1. John Jones and Tony Utting were happy with the draft fax I circulated about Castleton's
experts reports. Counsel suggested some changes and it has been sent to Castleton‘s
solicitors.

2. As you will see from my email to Cath Oglesby today, we are now on the verge of having all
the 3 witness statements ready to be served and filed. In anticipation that this will be done
tomorrow or Monday of next week, I attach a draft letter that I propose to send to send to Mr
Castleton's solicitors with the statements, unless you have any objections. The ball will then be
very firmly in their court.

3. Incidentally, did you have any comments on the draft letter that I emailed to you yesterday?
(further copy attached for ease of reference).

Kind regards.

Dear Mandy,

I attach a copy of a letter dated 17 January from Rowe Cohen solicitors together with my draft
reply for your approval. They have rejected the Part 36 Offer and will revert to us on the
question of whether they will agree to set aside the Default Judgment.

In the meantime, they have put forward an explanation for why the Marine Drive branch
needed to order extra cash. I have dealt with their assertions in my draft reply (copy
attached), but thought that you and John Jones would like to see that reply before it is sent in
case you have any particular comments.

(John, Mr Castleton's solicitors have not yet seen your witness statement as I am going to
serve them all together once we have finalised Cath Oglesby's statement).

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
