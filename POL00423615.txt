Governance

Section

Total 93%
Accountability
Section Total
97%

Clear accountability structures within your whistleblowing arrangements will help staff better
understand their roles. By ensuring that senior leaders actively engage with the whistleblowing
arrangements, you may be able to improve staff trust and confidence.

Recommendation

There are no specific recommendations at this stage.
POL00423615
POL00423615

Policy

Section Total

98%

Awell drafted whistleblowing policy helps to provide staff with a clear understanding of what
whistleblowing is and the processes by which an individual can raise and/or escalate a concern. It will
also provide staff with assurances about victimisation and confidentiality.

Recommendation

There are no specific recommendations at this stage.

Review & Reporting

Section Total
78%

Conducting reviews of whistleblowing arrangements enables organisations to see whether the
arrangements are effective in practice and to develop learning points from the process.

Recommendation

Additional work should be considered to strengthen governance. When reviewing the arrangements,
recommendations should be assigned ownership with a timeline for completion. Serious concerns raised
and positive outcomes from whistleblowing cases should be reported to the Board. These should be
redacted in order to protect the identity of the whistleblower. You could consider incorporating an
overview of management information on whistleblowing in published data e.g. annual reports.

Engagement

Communications

Section Total
60%

Communicating and engaging with staff on the whistleblowing arrangements is essential to building a
culture where staff feel confident raising their concerns and improving awareness of the whistleblowing
arrangements.

Recommendation

To achieve best practice, you should consider implementing a network of individuals who are visible to
staff to promote the whistleblowing arrangements (e.g. whistleblowing advocates). Encourage managers
within your organisation to communicate messages regularly, encourage whistleblowing concerns in
face to face meetings and briefings, and consult with staff groups and their representatives on staff
awareness and confidence in the whistleblowing arrangements.
POL00423615
POL00423615

Training

Section Total

46%

Clear and detailed training on whistleblowing helps your workforce to understand your arrangements
and their role within them.

Recommendation

We recommend that staff, designated managers and line managers receive in-depth training on
whistleblowing. In most circumstances line managers or named designated contacts are the first people
to receive a whistleblowing concern. Accordingly, line managers should receive appropriate training in
order to accurately identify concerns and effectively handle the individual raising the concern. This
minimises the likelihood that concerns will be escalated further and helps make best use of your
resources. You may wish to review how you provide training to your workforce (e.g. instructor led by e-
learning).

Support and Protection

Section Total
77%

Implementing effective processes for managing confidentiality and victimisation will help to ensure that
staff are appropriately supported and protected throughout.

Recommendation

To improve on this score in line with best practice, you should consider reviewing case files of
whistleblowing cases to ensure that any breaches of confidentiality or complaints of victimisation have
been appropriately acted upon. You may wish to obtain feedback from whistleblowers who have used
your arrangements to ensure they feel supported through the process of raising concerns. You should
ensure that workers are encouraged to seek advice on how settlement agreements operate with respect
to whistleblowing disclosures.

Recording & Investigations

Section Total

100%

Having clear processes and principles for recording and investigating concerns will help to ensure
consistency in handling and supporting the whistleblower.

Recommendation

There are no specific recommendations at this stage.

Resolution & Feedback

Section Total

100%

Providing feedback to the whistleblower is an essential stage of the whistleblowing process. Doing this
well will mean that you know the concern has been addressed and that those raising a concern have not
suffered as a result of the whistleblowing process. This will lead to better trust and confidence in the
arrangements overall.

Recommendation

There are no specific recommendations at this stage.
