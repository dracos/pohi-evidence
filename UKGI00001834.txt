Subject: Briefing for Post Office Meeting [11th July @ 12:00]
Attachment: POL Meeting Briefing_11Jul13_FINAL.DOC

Michael, Claire,

Ahead of the meeting with Post Office tomorrow at 12:00 please see attached a briefing that provides some background
to the session and highlights areas that Post Office management will be keen to cover off.

Post Office is acutely aware that SoS / Jo might also want to talk about the Second Sight report into POL’s Horizon
computer system that was published earlier in the week, and the impact that this has had on a small number of
subpostmasters. This remains a key focus area for POL however they would like to focus Thursday's meeting on their
new strategy and plans for transforming the post office network. Should SoS / Jo want to talk about the Second Sight
report POL will be more than happy to meet at a time that is convenient to cover it in detail.

If you have any questions in advance of tomorrow please let me know.

Kind regards,

Tim
