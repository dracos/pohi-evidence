I refer to my email below. There is no need to reply as Mr Jenkins rang CK and spoke Chris Powell who informed him ,
he was not required for the wylie case. Chris did not elaborate or enter into conversation with him.

Please see email from Gareth Jenkins which is self explanatory . Given the sensitive nature of issue and to manage the
relationship between Post office and Fujitsu it is worthwhile a considered response should be given by Bond
Dickinson on behalf of the Post Office.

Rachael,

I’ve now returned from leave, and had been hoping to have had an update from you regarding the email I sent at the
beginning of the month.

Please can you confirm whether or not the Kym Wylie case is proceeding next week and more importantly whether I
am needed.

Regards

Gareth

Rachael,
I thought it was worth checking out what (if anything) is still outstanding.

I currently have October 7“ to 11" pencilled in for Kim Wylie in Newcastle. Is that still on? I am on leave from 14" to
29" September, but can sort out any details when I’m back at the start of October if I am still required.

1 also have Thomas Brown (also in Newcastle) pencilled in for November 18" to 21°. However I have heard that that
case has been dropped so presumably I can release those dates?

Other than that I am not aware of anything else outstanding, but if you disagree, then please let me know.
Thanks
Regards

Gareth

Further to my previous email, I can confirm that you do not need to attend the Jishaan Patel trial, thank you for
assistance with that case.

Enjoy your weekend

Thank you for your email.

Thomas Brown - this case has been adjourned until the 18 November 2013 and is listed for a 4 day trial at Newcastle
Crown Court. The court relisted it to allow time for the Insight2 report to be published in/around August 2013. Are you
available for the above dates? Please could you book it in your diary, and let me know if you have any problems with
those dates.

Jishaan Patel - I think I may have informed you that you are no longer required in this case, however, I do not have
the file to hand. I will email you as soon as I confirm the position with Martin, which may be this afternoon or first thing
on Monday. I just want to be doubly sure before I confirm one way or another.

Kind regards

Rachael

Subject: RE: Outstanding Cases

Rachael,
I wondered if you had any updates regarding these two cases. Specifically:

1. Is the Brown case still on for 17" June? If so when exactly am I needed and for how long? As I mentioned
before I am going away on holiday next Friday (7"" June) and do not return to work until Monday 17°. I will
not have access to email while I am away (but will pick up messages on my mobile). Therefore if I need to go
to Newcastle — particularly on Sunday 16" to be there first thing on Monday - I need to make the
arrangements next week (if necessary provisional arrangements which can be subsequently cancelled). Also
I’m out of the office in meetings much of next week with possibly limited access to email — hence sending my
request for an update today.

2. What is the situation with the Jishan Patel case scheduled for 16" July. Can I commit to being at my Charity’s
AGM on 17"?

Regards

Gareth

Subject: RE: Outstanding Cases

Rachael,
Thanks for the updates. It is particularly good to hear that Jamie Dixon is no longer blaming Horizon.
I’ve noted the revised dates and assume that Wylie is still down for October in Newcastle.

Please note that the Brown case is scheduled for immediately after I return from Holiday, so I will probably need to
make hotel and perhaps train bookings before going on leave. In particular, if I need to be in Newcastle before
lunchtime on the Monday 17" I will need to travel there on the Sunday. Therefore I'll be in touch for an update on the
likelihood of the case continuing at the beginning of June so I can prepare plans before I go away. (I can pick up
messages on my mobile while I am away, but will not have access to email until I return late on Friday 14").

When the Jishan Patel case was previously scheduled in February, I was told I was no longer needed. Has something
changed to mean I am required this time? I’ve also realised that I have a prior meeting on Wednesday 17° July which
I had forgotten to mention to you before. It is the AGM of a Charity of which I am Treasurer so I would very much
prefer not to miss it if at all possible.

Regards

Gareth

Gareth

Thank you for your email. There have been quite a few developments in the Horizon cases recently and I can update
you as follows:

Ishaq - Due to be sentenced on 22 April 2013 at Bradford CC.

Brown - Listed for a four day trial, starting on the 17th June 2013 at Newcastle CC - Please could you diarise these
dates.

Dixon - You will no longer be required for the trial which was listed for the 12th August 2013 at Exeter CC, Mr Dixon is
due to enter a guilty plea to the full amount on the 30 May 2013. He has submitted a basis of plea, a copy of which I
have attached. Most importantly it confirms that he no longer blames the Horizon system.

Sefton & Nield - You will no longer be required for this case, as it is now listed for sentence on the 3 May 2013 at
Liverpool Crown Court.

Jishaan Patel - Listed for a trial on 16 July 2013 at Preston CC - The 16th is a Tuesday, please could you diarise the
16 - 23 July 2013 and I will establish how long this case is likely to last for and let you know.

Thank you for your continuing assistance, it is very much appreciated
Kind regards

Rachael

Rachael,
I thought it was worth checking up exactly what cases are still outstanding.

I currently have:
1. Wylie: 7* to 11° October 2013 Newcastle
2. Dixon: No dates
3. Brown: No dates
POL00169308
POL00169308

I think the rest of the cases are all closed as far as I am concerned.
Therefore I don’t think that I have anything outstanding as far as current cases are concerned.

FYI I have booked a holiday from 7” to 14" June inclusive. I also expect to have 2 weeks holiday in September (dates not known
yet).

Has there been a sentence for Ishaq yet? I think that was due around now.
Regards

Gareth
