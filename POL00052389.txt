Dear Sirs
Be: Post Office Limited v Peter Anthony Holmes - Newcastle Crown Court

Further to previous correspondence in this matter.

We trust that you have now had time to consider the accountant’s report forwarded to you on 30
July 2009. We believe that you will be in difficulty if you pursue the prosecution in relation to
count 1 on the Indictment. It is clear from the accountant’s report that no monies amounting to
£46,049,16 have passed through our client's bank account and that the monies you initially
questioned are from our client's wife's small business,

In light of this we would propose that no evidence is offered to count 7 and an alternative charge
of false accounting contrary to section 17 (2) of the Theft Act 1968 be added to the Indictment.
The Particulars of Offence to read Peter Anthony Holmes during the 1 August 2007 and the 19
September 2008 made statements that were misleading, false or deceptive in an account in that he
falsified accounts relating to the Post Office, Jesmond to cover increasing shortfalls to ensure that

the accounts balanced.

We understand that it has been mentioned that the Post Office Ltd would still seek to recover the
missing £46,049.76 from Mr Holmes. We stress that this does not form part of our offer and
indeed our client has no means to pay such a sum.

We look forward to hearing from you. :

Yours faithfully

Denise Jackman
