Craig Tuthill; Andy Bayfield

Craig/Andy,

This is the formal words used in external communications. I would be
happy to circulate this to the contracts community if you think that
this is fit for purpose?

POL is fully satisfied that the Horizon systems and the accounting
processes around it are robust and fit for purpose and the system is
endorsed by the National Federation of Sub-postmasters. Our systems have
been subjected to independently assured testing processes, information
security is accredited to industry standards and the system also meets
all payment industry standards, Necessary checks and balances are in
place throughout the system to ensure its integrity and secure audit
logs are maintained for all activity. The accounts of the company are
subject to full appropriate external audit.

Thanks
Tracy
