Further to my email below, we have now had further discussions with the Minister’s office about how best to

communicate the decision to end the work on the Review and focus on the litigation.

BIS officials remain of the view that they wish to prepare the ground with the Minister face to face before
any letter is sent. They have suggested that it might useful for you and Richard Callard to have a word about
Ministerial handling in the margins of next week’s Board meeting. This seems sensible since it will,
presumably, be a bit clearer by then whether any relevant Ministerial reshuffle will take place in the

aftermath of yesterday’s vote.

Accordingly, my recommendation is that, subject to that conversation with Richard, we send the letter to the

Minister in week commencing 4 July.

As ever, do call if you wish to discuss.

Kind regards

Jane

Tim

Following our conversation last week, I now attach the letter of advice addressed to Post Office Limited
received from Bond Dickinson, and which summarises the advice received from Antony de Garr Robinson
QC. We have also been in discussion with BIS as to the best way for this to be raised with the Minister.

In conversations today with the Minister’s office, they have confirmed that they understand (and indeed had
anticipated) the need for prioritising the litigation and therefore for work to cease on your review, however
we have been advised that they wish to consider further the choreography — in particular:

e The Minister is (understandably) somewhat pre-occupied this week with the Referendum and
other matters. There is also the risk that Ministerial responsibilities may change depending on the
outcome of the Referendum. Accordingly the Minister’s office believes it may be better to delay
the communication until next week.

e They are considering the best way to update the Minister and whether her officials should
provide the Minister (and possibly the Secretary of State) with a briefing ahead of receiving the
letter.

Accordingly I have prepared (and now attach) a suggested letter for you to consider. I will update you on
the suggested choreography once we have received further advice from the Minister’s office — which we
expect tomorrow.

Kind regards,

Jane
