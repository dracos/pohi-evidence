1. Terms of Reference (ToRs)

It was noted that at the meeting of the Post Office Limited Board on 29
January 2018, the Board established a committee to receive advice
relating to the Postmaster Litigation. The Company Secretary tabled
draft terms of reference for the Committee which were noted and
approved for recommendation to the Board at the next Board meeting I
on 27 March 2018. It was explained that day-to-day decisions on the
litigation were taken by the executive but that the Board was consulted
in advance of any significant decisions being taken.

2. Litigation timetable and suggested dates for future meetings

The litigation timetable and suggested dates for future meetings were
noted. It was

reported that the Common Issues Trial would be in November 2018 and
the Horizon

Trial would be in March 2019. The timing for the Committee meetings
had been

scheduled around the key dates in the litigation, as well as also being
as close

to Board meetings as possible.

Mr Parsons noted that to date the Court supported a narrower approach
to the disclosure of documents, however this still amounted to hundreds
of thousands of documents being identified for disclosure, and provision
of these documents to the solicitors for the applicants was underway to
support the first hearing in November regarding the proper construction
of the contracts between Post Office and the applicant postmasters.

Scope of Horizon hearing

It was noted that the Horizon hearing (to be held in March 2019) was
limited to technical questions about how the system operated in
branch.

Appointment of IT expert

The appointment of IT experts by both sides to support the Horizon trial
was noted. The quality of the opinion provided by the expert would be
critical. The Committee noted that Dr Robert Worden had been
appointed by Post Office Limited and a summary of his previous
experience as an expert witness was discussed.

Application for security for costs

The proposed application for security for costs was noted. Mr Parsons
advised that an application for security for costs was not unusual and
that based on the ongoing discussions, he believed that a consensual
agreement could be reached without the requirement for a court order.

Protocol for engagement with UKGI

The request from UKGI for regular briefings on the progress and status
of the litigation was discussed and it was noted that UKGI and Post
Office were discussing a draft protocol to enable such information to be
shared. The Committee noted that such briefings could involve legally
privileged information and that it was important for such privilege to be
maintained.

Contingency planning

The Committee requested work to be undertaken on contingency plans
should the outcome of either or both of the two trials be adverse to Post
Office Limited.

It was reported that A VDB was leading on this work and that the
Committee would receive regular updates.

It was noted that 33 former Postmasters had applied to the Criminal
Cases Review Commission (‘CCRC’) to review the terms of their
convictions. Mr Williams noted that Post Office was cooperating fully
with the CCRC and we believed that they were nearing the end of their
investigations. Nevertheless, Post Office considered it unlikely that a
decision would be made public before the conclusion of the Horizon trial.
The Committee noted that the outcome of the CCRC work could be that
cases were referred to the Court of Appeal.

7. AOB

Next meeting.

It was noted that at the next meeting on 15 May 2018, Post Office’s I
appointed QCs would attend to discuss the progress of the case.
