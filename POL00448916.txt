If Post Office considers it needs further information or evidence to support
a claim, it will write to the Claimant with a Request for Further Information.

ASSESSMENT OF CLAIM

Post Office will assess the claim in accordance with the principles with the

objective of delivering compensation which is fair in all the circumstances.

Post Office will then make a without prejudice offer of compensation. If Post
Office does not consider that elements of the losses claimed would be
recoverable, Post Office will explain why and, where appropriate, invite the

Claimant to provide further information and/or evidence.

If the Claimant accepts the offer made, Post Office will make payment within
28 days.

If the Claimant agrees with Post Office's offer in respect of some, but not
all heads of loss, the Claimant may accept the offer in respect of the agreed
heads of loss alone, in which event payment in respect of the agreed heads
of loss will also be made within 28 days.

If the Claimant does not wish to accept the offer made, the Claimant should
explain why they interpret the existing evidence differently and/or provide
any additional evidence in support of their position.

Post Office will consider the reasons put forward by the Claimant and any
further information received and make a revised offer, if appropriate, with
a view to agreeing where possible the level of compensation payable.

INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT

If, following without prejudice discussions, Post Office and the Claimant are
unable to reach agreement on the whole or parts of the claim, either Party

may request an Independent Assessment, via the Independent Assessor.

Independent Assessment provides an opportunity for the Claimant to have
a third party, independent of Post Office, make a recommendation as to the
appropriate level of compensation to be paid in respect of any heads of loss
which are not agreed between the parties.

The Independent Assessor's recommendation will not be binding on the
parties. However, the expectation is that the guidance given by the
POL00448916
POL00448916

Independent Assessor will allow the parties to reach agreement in respect
of all remaining disputed heads of loss.

5.4 To facilitate the objective of reaching agreement in a swift and proportionate
fashion, Independent Assessment will be a without prejudice process and all
material produced shall be kept confidential between the parties to the
extent permitted by law, save for the fact that a claim or part of a claim has
been agreed and/or was referred for Independent Assessment shall not be
confidential.

5.5 The Independent Assessor shall consist of a panel of individuals with
relevant legal, financial and retail expertise. Together they comprise the
Independent Pecuniary Compensation Assessment Panel. The designated
Chairperson is Sir Gary Hickinbottom.

5.6 Terms of Reference for the Independent Pecuniary Compensation
Assessment Panel govern the procedure for Independent Assessment. In
summary, any party who wishes to refer disputed issues to the Independent
Assessor should:

5.6.1 Notify the Panel and the other party in writing of the planned
reference of the claim to the Independent Assessor, setting out the
heads of loss to be referred.

5.6.2 Share with the Independent Assessor and the other party, a concise
summary of their position on the disputed issues, together with any
relevant supporting documents which may include the prior
correspondence between the parties. A standard application form
has been prepared and this should be completed.

5.6.3 The other Party should, within 10 working days, share a similar
summary setting out their position.

5.7. The Chairperson (or in their absence, his delegate) will consider the issues
referred for Independent Assessment and decide whether the claim should
be considered by:

11/85230081_1 4
POL00448916
POL00448916

5.7.1. Asingle panel member with the necessary specialism; or
5.7.2. All or a combination of panel members.

5.8 The chosen Assessor(s) will consider the parties' competing positions and
exercise their independent judgment to make a _ non-binding
recommendation as to the appropriate amount of compensation to be paid

in respect of all disputed heads of loss.

5.9 In order to do so, the Independent Assessor may ask the parties to take
any steps that they consider appropriate to reach a fair resolution of the
issues, including requesting further information or submissions, convening
a short hearing, or appointing any experts which they consider necessary.

5.10 In deciding the appropriate procedure to adopt, the Independent Assessor
will take account of the overriding objective of achieving swift and fair
resolutions at proportionate cost.

5.11 The Independent Assessor will make a recommendation including as to the
level of compensation which, in the Independent Assessor's opinion, should
be paid.

5.12 The Independent Assessor's recommendation shall be supported by short
written reasons and shall be shared with both parties at the same time.

6. STEPS FOLLOWING THE INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT

6.1 Following receipt of the Independent Assessor's recommendations, the
parties shall confirm whether they agree with the Independent Assessor's
recommendation and, in light of that, endeavour to reach settlement on the
compensation to be paid in respect of all outstanding heads of loss.

6.2 Post Office will make payment in respect of all agreed heads of loss within

28 days of a settlement being reached.

6.3 If the parties are not able to reach agreement on any heads of loss, the
Claimant retains the right to proceed to litigation in respect of any remaining
disputed issue(s) and the parties' legal rights remain unaffected.

7. COSTS

7.1 Post Office will pay the Claimants' reasonable costs of participation in this
Process on the standard basis, to be assessed if not agreed.
