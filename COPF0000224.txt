Laura,

While I have not yet informed El Kasaby that the case is not proceeding against
her, Iam content that we came to the right decision about trying to use her as a
witness rather than trying to prosecute her. She can take part in mediation if the
Post Office want her to. The reference is GG13010308.

Subject: Gorbals Post Office case

Andy

I hope you are well and thank you for meeting with Robert, Suzanne and I
before Christmas in relation to the above case. I am afraid that I do not have
the PF reference but I hope you know which one I am talking about.

I was just wondering if you had informed the potential accused Mrs El Kasaby
that the case would not be proceeding against her? Or indeed if that decision
had been taken? I know that this was the intention following our discussions.
The Post Office has a mediation scheme running at the moment which is to deal
with complaints made by sub-postmasters about the Horizon system and they
need to know if Mrs El Kasaby is going to be prosecuted, or not, so that they can
deal with her case.

Are you able to tell me?

Kind regards

Laura
