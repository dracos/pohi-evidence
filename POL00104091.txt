Dear Mark,

Thank you for the email. Apologies for the delay in getting back to you.

Chris and I have looked at the report. We think that Bond Dickinson have done a thorough job. We think that it
meets the recommendation in the report, and that what could reasonably be done in this regard has now been done.

Regards,

Jonathan

Subject: Private & Confidential - Subject to Legal Privilege. Findings in relation to Recommendation Number 7

Dear Jonathan,

In relation to the allegation (and your recommendation in respect of it) that our Helpline may have provided incorrect
advice to subpostmasters which resulted in a loss to the accounts, Bond Dickinson (the external firm conducting the
work) has now completed its investigations. Attached is the report they have produced.

Would you be able to please confirm whether or not the work performed and its findings discharges your below
recommendation?

“POL cross-reference specific complaints about misleading advice from NBSC call-handlers with
the possible employees who provided that advice and consider their personnel files, where available,
for evidence as to the likelihood that the complaint may be well-founded”.

Many thanks
Mark
