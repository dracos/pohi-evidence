Dear Andy
We spoke briefly.

I would be grateful if BD could produce a short bit of advice on the manner of implementation and consequences of a
future decision to terminate Second Sight’s engagement.

The advice needs to cover (but should not be limited to if other matters occur) the nature and extent of POL’s ability to
control access to, and uses of, all and any information it has provided SS; the duration and effectiveness of that control
in particular with regard to the Part Il report they are preparing; and the legal and practical effects of the 30 day notice
period which the letter of engagement provides for.

lam also interested in the effects, in legal and practical terms, of a termination given that the letter of engagement tries

to make it clear that, although they are engaged by us, they in fact work to the WG. You can imagine the sorts of
arguments which might be made.

Timescale is short, I fear — this should inform a discussion taking place at senior level tomorrow.
Happy to discuss
