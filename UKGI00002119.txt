News hot off the press - the case in OL's constituency has just been submitted to the mediation process, and will be
considered by the working group tomorrow. (initial view is that the application doesn't contain nearly enough information
to progress the case, so we will go back and ask for more. But obviously don't disclose that to OL yet.).

We have briefed OL in detail on the case in the past, and he was satisfied with our conclusions. (the branch is now
reopened as a local under a new agent).

If this comes up, worth emphasising the robustness of the process (chaired by air Anthony hooper etc) and the PO's
commitment to taking this seriously.

Let me know if you need any more.

Thanks,
Martin

progressing, with support from stakeholders like Arbuthnot, and the post office is also looking very seriously at how it can
improve its training and support for spmrs.

> The meeting's at 10.30 in Downing St, but Will needs to leave shortly to get through security. Yes, Martin H got the
constituency briefing over yesterday (many thanks to him for meeting the tight deadlines), any info on the 2nd Sight case
would be great.

> Hi Will - what time is your meeting with OL & DA? I think you've got the information on their constituency branches
now, but I'm still chasing down the latest on the case in Letwin's constituency which went into the Second Sight review.
Based on our previous discussion I understand that he was happy with our handling of the situation, but probably useful
for you to know whether this is one of the cases which have applied for the mediation scheme.
