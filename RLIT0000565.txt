Changes from last month (31 October 2024) in square brackets.

[-] indicates no change since last month.

2.1 Notes for table

In the ‘Claim data by scheme’ table:

e data regarding the HSS and OC are sourced from Post Office Ltd, which
retains full responsibility for the data published on its website

e the HCRS redress payments data reflect the current position at a point in
time. It should be noted that these totals can change slightly as time goes
on as payments are retrospectively confirmed as received by claimants

3. Overturned Convictions (OC)

Initial interim payments are available to eligible postmasters upon getting
their conviction overturned on the grounds that it was reliant on Horizon
evidence.

As of 29 November 2024, all 111 eligible claimants have either reached full
and final settlement or received a minimum of £200,000 via interim
payments.

Spend is rounded to the nearest £1 million.
A full and final claim is defined as:

e both non-pecuniary and pecuniary claims have been received and
sufficiently particularised to substantiate redress payments of £450,000 or
more

e or the claimant has requested the £600,000 fixed sum offer

Post Office Ltd have been progressing non-pecuniary settlements first to get
money to postmasters as quickly as possible, which means a number of
partial settlements have been reached in addition to the full and final
settlements published here.

Any individual with a conviction overturned by the Post Office (Horizon
System) Offences Act 2024 or the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences
RLITOO00565
RLITO000565

(Scotland) Act 2024 will be eligible to seek financial redress through the
HCRS.

3.1 Full and final claimant stages

As of 29 November 2024, there are 111 claimants eligible for financial
redress through the OC Scheme. From these 111, Post Office Ltd has
received 77 full and final claims.

4. Group Litigation Order (GLO) Scheme

Out of the 555 who were members of the GLO, 63 postmasters had
convictions and are therefore eligible to apply for redress once their
conviction has been overturned. If their conviction has been overturned by
the courts, they are eligible under the OC Scheme. If their conviction has
been overturned by the legislation, they are eligible for the HCRS.

The remaining 492 postmasters are eligible for the GLO Scheme, of whom
484 qualify for interim payments.

Efforts are ongoing to distribute the £19.5 million interim payments
announced in June 2022. Almost all claimants have received their interim
payments, with only a very small number remaining. Work continues to
ensure these outstanding payments are completed.

For full and final claims received, the number reported refers to all claims
assessed as complete. Further claims may have been received recently but
not yet assessed to determine whether they are complete. A claim initially
assessed as complete may subsequently be found to require further
information and therefore be removed from counts of complete claims
received while awaiting this information.

4.1 Full and final claimant stages

There are 492 claimants eligible for financial redress through the GLO
Scheme. As of 29 November 2024, 334 full and final claims have been
received.

4.2 GLO Scheme delivery target

DBT is committed to a target of making a first offer to 90% of claimants who
have submitted a full claim within 40 working days. A full claim is defined as
a claim which DBT considers, with advice from its legal advisors, does not
need any further evidence in order to assess every element of the claim.

Should the department consider further evidence is needed in order to
make a full assessment, the 40 working day target will not start until such
time that the required evidence is received from the claimant or any other
source.

Over the lifetime of the scheme, to 29 November 2024, 89% of claimants
received their first offer within 40 working days of submitting a full claim.

The department has also announced a new self-imposed target of providing
a substantive response within 40 working days to 90% of claimants who
submit a complete challenge from 1 December 2024. A challenge will be
considered ‘complete’ if the department does not require any more
RLITO000565
RLITO000565

information from the claimant or their advisors in order to provide a
substantive response.

4.3 GLO Scheme £75,000 fixed payment impact

Due to changes made in January 2024, all eligible GLO claimants are now
offered the option to settle their claims on a full and final basis for a total
fixed sum of £75,000 inclusive of interest, instead of making a claim for their
individual losses.

This means that the claim would not be assessed by the department against
the process set out in the guidance and principles
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-scheme-for-group-
litigation-order-case-postmasters).

Any payments received from the department to date or from
the GLO settlement will be deducted from the £75,000 before payment is
made.

As of 29 November 2024, 235 offers have been accepted. 153 of these
have accepted offers of the £75,000 fixed payment. Of those who have
accepted the £75,000 fixed payment, four-fifths are new claims and a fifth
had previously accepted offers.

5. Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS)

Post Office Ltd received 2,417 eligible claims by March 2021.

The closure date for applications was 27 November 2020, but Post Office
Ltd continued to accept applications for the original deadline group up to
March 2021.

In October 2022, the government announced that additional funding would
be provided so that eligible late claimants could receive financial redress,
and the scheme reopened for applications.

Post Office Ltd has received 2,385 eligible late claims to date.

Interim payments on the HSS are available before and after claimants
receive an offer of redress.

The £245 million paid out on the HSS includes £31.9 million in interim
payments to original claimants and £7.4 million in interim payments to late
RLITOO000565

RLITO000565

applications.

On 13 March 2024, the government announced that all eligible HSS
claimants would be entitled to a fixed sum award of £75,000 to settle their
claim.

Post Office Ltd continues to make top-up payments to claimants who had
previously accepted a full and final offer below the value of £75,000, to bring
their total redress to £75,000.

Post Office Ltd have also started to make payments of the full £75,000 fixed
sum award to HSS applicants who have not previously received redress but
have now accepted this offer. The number and amount of offers and
payments made for the full fixed sum are now included in the HSS figures
and in the HSS eligible late claims figures on the ‘Claim data by scheme’
table.

As of 29 November 2024, approximately £122 million has been paid in
award top-ups and £75,000 awards.

5.1 Eligible claimant stages

As of 29 November 2024, 4,802 claims for financial redress have been
received through the HSS. This includes applications received before the
original deadline, and applications received since the scheme reopened in
October 2022.

Of the total 4,802 claims received, 2,511 have been paid and a further 34
have accepted offers and are awaiting payment. 637 claimants are currently
in receipt of offers that they haven't yet accepted and the remaining 1,620
claimants are awaiting offers from the Post Office Ltd.

6. Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme
(HCRS)

The Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 and the Post Office
(Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Act 2024 quashed Horizon-related
convictions on a blanket basis in June 2024, according to a set of criteria in
the Acts, covering each UK nation.

On 30 July 2024, the UK government announced the launch of the Horizon
Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS) (https:/Awww.gov.uk/guidance/horizon-
convictions-redress-scheme-hcrs-applying-for-financial-redress), delivered by the
Department for Business and Trade (DBT), to provide financial redress to
postmasters across the UK who had their convictions quashed by the Acts.

Applicants have begun registering for the HCRS and the department is
working with the relevant justice authorities to confirm individual applicants’
eligibility for the scheme.

Eligible applicants have a choice of 2 routes to redress: they can either
accept a fixed and final sum of £600,000, or they can choose to submit their
application to a detailed assessment process.

All eligible applicants are entitled to an initial interim payment of £200,000.

The department is now publishing data on settlements, broken down by
initial interim payments and full and final settlements.

6.1 Full and final claimant claims

As of 29 November 2024, 98 full and final claims for financial redress have
been received through the HCRS. Of these 98 claims, 82 have received
payments and the remaining 16 have accepted offers for redress and are
awaiting payment from DBT.
