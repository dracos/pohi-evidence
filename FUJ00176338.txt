Information: Read performance still slower than expected on Bootle
centera, i.e. Bootle appears to be running at 2/3 of the speed of
Cube. Please contact Richard

} or Alan Holmes ¢ GRO I for further

iks, SG 2

Information: CFM3 have not seen any errors on these ports relating to
the centra cubes at Bootle. Sniffer traces were performed on

the LAN and normal activity was observed, there was RIP on

this LAN which as I understand is not needed as these boxes

luse a default route, this can easily be stopped on this LAN,

Jnowever if these updates are being used could have wider
limplications. KB@CFM3

Information: Could a comparison be performed from the Network
jperspective on devices etc between the set-up at Wigan and the set-up
lat Bootle to see if there are any differences that maybe

causing the poorer performance at Bootle. Thanks, SG

information: I can see no difference in the way the network is set up at
Higan and Bootle and these also run the same protocols, i
can still see no errors on any of the ports. Have the boxes
themselves been checked, are the configuration/setup the
same for these boxes and is the information load at both Wigan
lan Bootle the same. If all this is well suggest a PC/Laptop
lusing Centera cables is placed on the Lan and ping testing
lis carried out (as Centera has no ICMP capability response
times are hard to determine). This will require an outage of
the centera at Bootle hence it will probably require an
