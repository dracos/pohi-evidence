Mark Pearce certainly believes that they do. There is general evidence that suggests CSC have been a little slow to react
to business requests over the past few months ~ not just for this instance. (’ll check in with Mark for an update.

Many thanks,

Can I take it from the delayed CSC response that they do hold email archives for the relevant period?

Below is the current status with regard to gathering documentation on our Bracknell site operations and other specific
enquiries.

Susan Crichton and Lesley Sewell are already fully aware of this status — they requested it earlier this week — therefore
none of this will be any surprise to Susan when you meet with her.

Attached are the Fujitsu Security policies that were in place in 2008 and the Fujitsu policy on the management of
buildings access and access to systems. I do have a concern that the current information flow from Fujitsu is slow. I will
be escalating this through my main contact — Pete Newsome — today.

Any further thoughts from yourself — if you have them - would be welcome.

Establish any formal documentation relating to the operational set-up, data security protocols and the control
environment within the Bracknell site during 2008

I have spoken to both Peter Stanley (Architect) and Pete Newsome (Fujitsu) on obtaining information relating to the
above. Peter Stanley has stated to me that our Architects have no formal documentation on record relating to our
Bracknell site therefore I am almost completely reliant on Fujitsu providing any documentation. Pete Newsome engaged
with the Fujitsu Security team early last week for them to source. To date I have only received the security policies as
they existed in 2008 (x2 documents) and the Fujitsu user management policy for buildings and systems access (x1
document). Pete has admitted that tracking down information relating to the Bracknell site itself has been difficult,
hence slow progress but continues to chase. I have reiterated the urgency of the request. Will escalate if situation
continues.

Provide a ring-fence on all emails since 2008 for listed employees deemed as involved in Bracknell operations

Mark Pearce was provided with the list of employees w/c 3 March to instigate the action with CSC. Mark predicted that
the task would probably take CSC a week to complete. As of this point it remains outstanding. Mark’s comment is that
CSC have been slow in react to the request, however he believes this will be completed this week. Mark will provide me
with details of the process and collation of the archive files and how the information is stored.

Investigate whether there were any known issues with Bureau de Change transactions during the Summer of 2008

I spoke initially with the Bureau team (Eddie Jarman) who then suggested speaking with Mark Wood in Chesterfield.
Mark then directed me to Andy Wynn (Relationship Manager), who by all accounts is already conducting investigations
work for Second Sight on our behalf.

The outcome is that the only related issue that can be established in 2008 regards duplicate remittance pouches for
which there is a clear process for the Branch Manager to follow and which is backed up on Horizon help. This scenario
incurs when a pouch is scanned into the system but then the Branch Manager recognises they have made an error with
regard to pouch content — e.g. they forgot to include a remittance summary etc. A second pouch would then need to be
used and scanned into the system — meaning that two pouches are logged. There is a reversal process for the manager
to instigate that takes the first pouch off of the system.

Hilan
I thought it about time I provided an update on where I have got to regarding the actions below.

Can you let me know whether you want me to drip-feed through any documentation I gather or prefer
to agree a date by which I'll send you all i have.

It’s rather limited at the moment in terms of quantity but I guess every little helps.

Thanks
Steve

Thanks for the clarification lan, very helpful.

I will work on the basis of gathering whatever original documentation I can against the listed item areas
and will additionally ensure I retain an audit trail relating to source.

Good to hear from you and many thanks for the action list

The items listed are fine but please bear in mind that we are looking for original contemporary
documents rather than summaries. I see this as largely a document collation exercise rather than the

preparation of summaries, synopsis etc.

What I’m trying to do is to get inside the head of people who were working on or associated with this
project and find out what was actually going on.

Also please bear in mind that this matter relates to potential litigation and you need to take care to
document the work you do and where each document comes from. It is also important not to alter the
content of or the meta-data associated with any documents.

Please give me a call if you want to discuss any of this.

With best wishes

Hi lan

Through my subsequent meeting with Lesley, I believe the list below represents the immediate agreed
actions.

Please let me know if your interpretation is any different.
1} Provide a synopsis of the history of Bracknell in relation to set-up and operations prior to 2008.

2) Provide an overview of data management within Bracknell - how and what data is obtained,
used, encrypted etc. and the protocols that exists around it.

3) Aview on the control environment within Bracknell and how this has developed/altered since
2008.

4) Provide a ring-fence on all emails since 2008 for listed employees deemed as involved in
Bracknell operations. (Note: some of these individuals may have since left the POL business).

5) Investigate the archive attendance/registration list for Bracknell on the specific day in 2008 Mr
Rudkin visited the site in an attempt to ascertain who was involved and engaged with on the site

tour.

6) Investigate whether there were any known issues with Bureau de Change transactions during
the Summer of 2008 and summarise.

Thanks
