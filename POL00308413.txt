Subject: BBC Today Programme

Both

The BBC Today programme has bid to speak to Paula tomorrow morning about the MP letter and Sparrow.
JA will be going on.

My view is that we should decline and send our statement. But given the nature of the programme, and the events of
summer 2013 I wanted to take your view.

As a reminder, we declined Today following the Second Sight report in 2013. Jo Swinson was unhappy with this decision.
BIS then agreed to the parliamentary statement.

BIS line on Sparrow is that it is operational matter but the minister may not take this view. I am in touch with Richard C.

If we do agree to an interview it should be with me rather than Paula. My view remains that we need to ride this out,
unpleasant though it will be, but I wanted to update you.
