Simon

Quick question — attached is the original Helen Rose report which appears to include an Appendix. Did the Appendix
go out as part of the disclosures? If not, why not?

Kind regards
Andy

Rodric,

Please find associated a report from our Fraud Analyst, Helen Rose, in respect of Lepton SPSO. This office doesn’t

feature as part of our and Sight Spot Reviews, but the subject matter is Horizon (and indeed Credence) related. Could I
ask that you consider the report and feed any comments back, as it could be a potential issue at some stage.

In summary, the specifics concern a ‘system reversal’ of a transaction following a system failure. This is normal
practice, but the Horizon logs (and Credence logs) indicate that the reversal is an ‘existing reversal’, implying that the
reversal was manually entered by the clerk/Subpostmaster.

I think there’s a remote possibility that this could be a problem in terms of using the data for evidence/prosecution
purposes, but nevertheless it is still a possibility. Myself or Helen are happy to talk through anything that requires
explanation.

Regards,

Dave Posnett I Accredited Financial Investigator
