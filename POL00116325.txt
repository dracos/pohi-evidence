Brieing Note for Paula (to go to Alice Monday)
Paula Briefing MP Meeting 24th March V3 .docx

Please find attached the draft briefing note (thank you Simon, Ruth, Rodric and David for all of your help).

A few things to note:

I reviewed Q&As included in this note with Rodric and Ruth. However, I think we need to clarify the
compensation question

David is going to speak to Janet. Once we have attendees we will add a short note about the attendees to the
brief (questions / issues etc)

I have sent the note to Angela, when I hear back I will update her section

If you could get comments back to me as soon as possible tomorrow I will send a revised version first thing Monday
morning.

Belinda, Mark and Jane please can I ask that you track your changes and then circulate to this group.

Thanks

Sophie
