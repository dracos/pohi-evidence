IAdditional stability issues have been noted by POCL (e.g. hour glass appearing at unexpected times). POCL (John Meagher) to
ensure that Pathway is kept up to date with new types of incidents as seen by POCL.

Vorkshop 7 Update: JM stated that the hour glass problems are that there is no indication of the period of time to complete the
peration and that it appears (and disappears) intermittently. DH explained that it is a function of the “system busy” operation and]
that whilst, in the short term, it might be possible to adjust parameter / threshold settings, the long term solution might be a slider
ar. Tony Oppenheim explained that Pathway could not give a commitment on a long term solution at this time.

IIn addition Pathway (Steve Muchow) to produce a report to show how existing outlets will be monitored separately from newly 17" Sept
Jrolled out outlets (Borough High Street being the first of these).

IWorkshop 7 Update: Discussion focused on the form of measurement. For Pathway, DH proposed the number of re-boots,

[possibly categorised. For POCL, JM proposed a weighted measure being the product of the time duration of the adverse business

impact (e.g. denial of service) and a factor linked to the nature of the business event (e.g. 3 for customer service, 2 for an off-line
peration and I for other such as log-on, log-off). The time duration should include that of incident workarounds not just re-boots.

Issues discussed included the ability to agree targets on these measures based on historic data, the distinction between incidents
ind advice / guidance and also whether the measurement base should include all live outlets or just the 320 Live Trial ones. No
igreement was reached, although Tony Oppenheim stated that Pathway’s issues are with the timing, as opposed to the principles,
f POCL’s proposals and that POCL had changed its position by introducing the new outlets into the measurement.

Irectification plan.

orkshop 7 Update: Pathway (Dave Hollingsworth) tabled (CR/ACD/298 v0.6 16/9/99), an updated version of the Resolution
Plan for AI 298. John Meagher reported general satisfaction with progress and therefore an agreed resolution plan subject to final
review by Jeremy Folkes and Bob Booth and to the inclusion of incident workarounds as well as re-boots (see also item 6 above
concerning metrics). In connection with section 5.2.4, it was agreed that the long term target should be an average of one per four
jmonths — this to include all incidents not just re-boots.

(ACTION Jeremy Folkes and Bob Booth to review Resolution Plan v0.6 today (JM). 17" Sept.
‘Note however that the failure to agree on the metrics (item 6) means that the Resolution Plan is not acceptable to POCL.)

Workshop 6 Update: This will now be part of the contractual discussions being held between POCL (Keith Baines) and PathwayI14-16" Sept
Tony Oppenheim).

Workshop 7 Update: This issue has now focused on the success criteria for NRO resumption, at the review in November.
[Pathway had previously proposed four weeks operation with <= 1.5% error rate.

[Keith Baines and Ruth Holleran proposed an error rate of 0.6% (the current average is 1.2%) together with six other conditions,
lfive of which are listed in RH’s paper and the sixth being a further two weeks period of live running of the permanent Cash
(Account fix prior to the actual re-commencement of NRO in January.

(2) no re-ocurrence of ... problems; (3) (4) updates to TIP AIS agreed; (5) ...; (6) new incident ...: (7)

[Tony Oppenheim responded as follows: 0.6% error rate agreed subject to this being measured as the average of six weeks from 4"
[October to mid November; maximum of ten working days to analyse each TIP fault (root cause analysis, diagnosis and agree
Iresolution) agreed except for faults requiring diagnostics; further two weeks period agreed subject to agreement on the logistics of
he plan. On the basis of the current plan, this condition would lead to a two weeks delay in the planned date for re-
jcommencement of NRO — this was agreed. Re the error rate criterion, the Cash Account does not reconcile and is attributable to
jan error in the POCL domain. The error rate is to be calculated as the ratio of the number of incidents and the total number of
cash accounts during the six weeks period.

le development of the process/procedures for the December data integrity fix

IWorkshop 6 Update: POCL to review latest version of rectification plan (handed out at meeting). Discuss issues with Pathway
nd jointly resolve.

orkshop 7 Update: Pathway issued Acceptance Resolution Plan for AI 376 (CR/ACD/376 v0.6 16/9/99), Ruth Holleran
jadvised that the main outstanding issue is the absence of a general facility for recovered transactions notified on the RED report to}

e then transmitted electronically across the TIP interface. Tony Oppenheim / John Pope advised that this had not been Pathway’s
jinterpretation and that there would be difficulties with such a facility including interference with POCL’s data, the possibility of
reversing a previously sent file and potentially lengthy development work, which may be unique to each case. John Meagher statedI
that, in general, the correction of an exception transaction may need joint investigation from POCL and Pathway.

{Tony Oppenheim further proposed (a) that POCL should have or develop a journal entry facility to deal with RED reports, (b) that
[Pathway should not alter data on POCL’s transactions (c) that Pathway should concentrate on fixing faults that give rise to
exceptions in the first place, (d) £100 compensation per manually entered transaction and (¢) that Pathway would undertake ad-
hoc development work to achieve electronic transmission in the case of large-scale problems as and when they occurred.
