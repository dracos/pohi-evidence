1 Purpose

This document sets out ICL Pathway’s proposal that Acceptance Incident 376,
currently categorised as Medium by Pathway and High by POCL, should be
recategorised by POCL as Medium, and that the Resolution Plan is satisfactory
and should be agreed.

2 Summary

Pathway contends that there are Clearance Actions that address the three
remaining issues defined by POCL.

The issue relates to not passing records to TIP because of harvester exceptions
caused by missing functions in counter code. ICL Pathway has taken measures
to both stop known occurrences and to ensure that any unforeseen occurrences
are reported both to TIP and to ICL Pathway development.

The occurrence of a functionally unrelated incident considered under this
Acceptance Incident, the omission of records from the counter cash account,
concerned only voucher products. This omission is in process of elimination.
In addition procedures have been tightened to minimise the risk of product
withdrawals causing operational difficulties at the counter.

Furthermore, additional reconciliation features that confirm the integrity of
data passing to TIP have been proposed.

3 = Criteria

Criterion 831/1 is cited: “The Contractor shall support interface from TMS and
Outlets to Transaction Information Processing (TIP).

4  POCL position
Based upon the minutes of the Acceptance Board Meeting of 18 August 1999,
POCL contended that:
“the plan is still immature”.

“the proposal not to deliver the additional controls until March 2000 is not
acceptable”.

“the latest analysis performed on Incident 410 ... has revealed further
unresolved deficiencies and the workaround for these is not agreed”.

5 Pathway position

5.1 Background

During the Live Trial, and since, incidents have occurred that, in POCL’s view,
constitute a potential threat to the integrity of their accounts. These are
tracked in Al376, TIP Acceptance Incident Status, and associated Root Cause
Analysis.

5.2 Maturity of plan

The elements of the resolution plan are defined as activities within the
integrated Acceptance Resolution Plan (currently version 0.9, 16/9/99).

The Pathway proposal in this area has now been expanded into the High Level
Design document Logical Design for EPOSS/TIP Reconciliation Controls. The
joint working group has reviewed this in detail. This document provides a
description of how Pathway will provide additional reconciliation between the
Cash Account produced in the outlet and the transactions sent to TIP. It
contains detailed proposals for enhancements to counter processing, harvesting
and the TPS Host.

5.3 Delivery of additional controls

Clearance action:

The document Logical Design for EPOSS/TIP Reconciliation Controls,
Version 0.7, 20/9/99 has been agreed and the enhancements will be in
service by 31/12/99.

5.3.1 Ongoing Analysis And Review Of Incidents
ICL Pathway will continue to analyse new incidents and will issue periodic
updates of the TIP Incident Status Report. This report will be reviewed jointly
fortnightly or as required.
ICL Pathway’s objective is to eliminate the root causes of such incidents as are

described in Section 2 above, while providing a clear method of communicating
rare error corrections.

5.3.2 Development Of Additional Reconciliation Controls

Additional controls through the introduction of reconciliation will be
developed as described in the document Logical Design for EPOSS/TIP
Reconciliation Controls.

POCL's requirement to have continued visibility of the functionality of the
solution will be met by re-issues of the above-mentioned document. Should

low level design affect any area within the high level design, then the Logical
Design document will be updated and re-issued to POCL.

Pathway is currently providing Harvester exception reporting and will continue
to do so until the additional Reconciliation Controls have entered service.

POCL is concerned regarding assurance of testing plans and testing activities.
ICL Pathway will issue the High Level Test Plans (HLTPs) to POCL for the
additional reconciliation controls and will also issue the corresponding Test
Reports, both for comment. POCL will provide such comments in a single
batch for each of the HLTPs and Test Reports within two weeks of their
provision to POCL. In addition, POCL may witness testing. The testing
strategy to be adopted for this Plan will be documented and provided to POCL.

5.3.3 Additional Reconciliation Procedures

POCL has observed that joint procedures for dealing with reconciliation
incidents need to be developed. ICL Pathway recognises the need for such
procedures and will work jointly with POCL to develop them. It is agreed that
these procedures will embrace the following five points:

1 POCL will accept manual error corrections of either transaction record
errors or cash account stream record errors up to an aggregate level of 50
per week

The original concept was replacement of missing transactions, because we
don’t in practise get transaction wrong, we either send them or we don’t.
The extension to include cash account records could open us up to the
claim that a cash account stream record is wrong if the cash account line
is wrong because, for example, we have not bought a product to account.
We must resist this, and argue that the sash account stream is correct if is
corresponds to the printed cash account, even if that is wrong.

2. Above this level Pathway will fix errors and (re)submit the data
electronically to the TIP interface, unless agreed otherwise by POCL.

This wording was added to vo.7 pursuant to agreements reached by Tony
O. The wording in vo.6 referred to us exceeding an average of 50
reconciliation errors per week over a 13 week period before we would
undertake anything other than manual correction of errors.

3. Manual error reports are to include a full specification of the repaired
transaction data, such that the data would pass the integrity checks if
resubmitted. Where it is necessary to make a judgement about a repair,
such judgement will be declared explicitly by Pathway. Data is to be
presented in a suitable format for POCL to key into a POCL data input
facility.

4. The delay between the occurrence of an error (or where applicable its
later detection) and the notification of the correction to POCL (either

manually in accordance with (1) above or electronically in accordance
with (2) above) shall not exceed five working days.

Hopefully clause 3.2 of the supplemental agreement means that we have to
use only reasonable endeavours to hit 5 days. The last major issue took
about 3 weeks to resolve.

5. Pathway is to pay POCL liquidated damages of £100 per transaction error
correction submitted manually.

This still refers only to transactions, so RED reports of Cash Account
errors would avoid a penalty. However I believe this clause to be
superseded by para 3.6.10 of the supplemental agreement.

The Contractor shall test the procedure described in sub paragraph (2) above prior to
the implementation of the additional reconciliation controls and POCL shall assist and
witness the attainment of the outcome.

The above procedures shall be introduced at the same time as the additional
reconciliation controls referred to in paragraph 5.3.2 above

The testing was originally restricted to testing the new software and, after argument, the
procedures for sending reconciliation reports to TIP. We now need to find a way to test
our ability to electronically repair both transaction and cash account stream, and send
or re-send to TIP. We need to work out what scenarios to test, and whether to test them
we need facilities to repair records. We could produce such facilities, but we are paying
TIP to do it!

5.4 Core to non-core (AI410)

Clearance action:

The document, Ceasing of Non-Core Products at Outlets, is agreed and ICL
Pathway will implement the defined functions for CSR+.

5.4.1 The position at CSR
Refinement to product management procedures at CSR:

AI 410, although related to AI 376 through the generality of reconciliation of the
Cash Account and the TIP stream, is in fact the reverse condition: a record that
was not incorporated in the Cash Account was received by TIP.

This condition was caused by ceasing a product at an outlet by changing it from
a Core product (transacted at all outlets) to Non-core (transacted at only a
subset). This resulted in “end dating” the Item Reference Data at an outlet that

had not received replacement non-core reference data but had transacted the
product earlier in the week, EPOSS did not include transactions in the Cash
Account that had occurred immediately before the product was end-dated at
the outlet.

It had been agreed, for CSR, that Operational Business Change procedures
would screen out cases of Item Reference Data being end-dated, the outlet
would not be able to perform housekeeping functions such as remitting out
remaining inventory in any case. The agreed process for removal from sale is
by use of changes to the Menu Hierarchy.

Unfortunately neither POCL nor Pathway staff involved had realised that
changing a product from Core to Non core would result in just such a cessation.
Procedure documentation has now been amended to make this case explicit.

ICL Pathway is introducing a change to ensure that all transactions for end-
dated products appear in the cash account. This will provide full accounting
integrity.

The parties shall carry out the procedures described in the document Process
For Removing Products From Outlets At CSR, Version 0.3. These procedures
will be revisited if experience so indicates.

Introduction of an enhanced proposal for item transaction modes at
CSR+:

A feature, Item Transaction Mode, is scheduled for introduction at CSR+ and
will provide a comprehensive means of controlling the classes of transaction
that can be applied to products. However, in the course of considering these
issues it was further realised that no provision at CSR+ in interfaces and designs
had been made for the particular case of end-dating Non-core products in
individual outlets.

This issue, ceasing Non-core products at individual outlets at CSR+, has been
addressed in the document Ceasing of Non-Core Products at Outlets, which was
published on 24/8/99, and which POCL has confirmed is acceptable.

6 Closure Criteria

The closure criteria agreed between the parties are:

1, That there will be an Observation Period of six weeks starting 1*t October
1999.

2. During the Observation Period there will be no reoccurrence of previously
fixed faults

3. During the Observation Period not more that 0.6% of Cash Accounts sent
to TIP will be found by TIP not to reconcile to the Cash Account derived by
TIP from the transaction stream due to Pathway processing error.

4. During the Observation Period Pathway will analyse all new incidents
within 10 working days, and report these analyses to TIP using the
established TIP Incident Status format. The 10 days starts from the time
TIP log the incident on the Pathway helpdesk. The analysis is to include an
expected fix implementation date. For incidents that cannot be reproduced
the result of analysis may be to implement diagnostic code.

5. There will be a period of parallel running of the Pathway and TIP
reconciliation process during which the Pathway solution must find at least
all those reconciliation failures correctly reported by TIP.
