1. Background

This document sets out the guidelines that govern the working relationship at the interface
between NBSC and HSH. It defines the customer and supplier responsibilities which both
POL and Fujitsu Services Pathway must undertake in order to support the delivery of incident
management to the Post Office network.

2.Intent of this Agreement

The intent of the agreement is to:

« Establish effective co-operation between NBSC and HSH in the delivery of incident
management to the Post Office network

e Agree responsibilities and detail the interactions that must take place, between NBSC and
HSH to ensure the successful delivery of a seamless incident management service to the
Post Office network.

© Provide a recognised definition of the responsibilities of NBSC and HSH in respect of the
delivery of incident management to the Post Office network.

3.Scope

This document defines:

« How the NBSC and HSH will provide a seamless incident management service to Post
Office and agreed POL and Fujitsu Services Pathway support groups.

© The incident types and responsibilities of each helpdesk with respect to those incidents
(detailed in appendix A).

e The way in which NBSC and HSH will co-operate when working together to manage the
resolution of complex incidents, where resolution responsibility is shared.

This document applies to the management of incidents, which occur during the everyday
operation by post office outlet staff and support of the Horizon solution by POL and Fujitsu
Services Pathway support groups.

This document does not define or suggest how POL and Fujitsu Services Pathway support
groups will resolve incidents. Incident resolution is therefore beyond the scope of this
agreement.

The document defines exceptional event as an event that may cause a 75% increase in call
volume and/or is likely to impact the operation of the call management process. Under these
circumstances, direct communication will take place between HSH and NBSC.

7. Process Models for HSH and NBSC Interaction

Four process diagrams are shown on the following pages. The first two relate to the HSH.
The third and fourth relate to the NBSC. The diagrams show the interfaces between the HSH
& NBSC and how those interfaces are expected to work in support of business as usual
activity.

The process diagrams include:

(a) an anti-call-bouncing link which prevents callers being passed backwards and forwards
between the two desks,

The process diagrams assume that:

(a) there is a well defined list of appropriate incidents for both desks, which accommodate
new unexpected incident types,

(b) The desk transferring an incident closes their incident when the other desk accepts the
transfer.

(c) The MIS systems associated with the NBSC and HSH will record the correct incident
type for incidents that are accepted via the anti-call-bouncing agreement.

(d) The performance of the anti- call bouncing agreement will be reviewed at the Helpdesk
Review forum to ensure the agreement does not impact on the contract

On the following four process diagrams only the sub-processes listed below relate directly to
this Interface Agreement. The other sub-processes shown on the diagrams and their
interactions are included for information purposes and may be subject to change solely at the
discretion of Fujitsu Services Pathway (sub-processes with prefix H) and Post Office (sub-
processes prefix N).

Processes relating directly to this interface agreement include:

H1, HS, H10, H11, H12, H13, H18, H19, H20, H21, H22, H23.

NI, N2, N10, N11, N12, N13, N18, N19, N20, N21, N22, N23.
