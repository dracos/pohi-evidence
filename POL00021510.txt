DIGITAL STRATEGY

Martin Moran, Sue Barton and Richard Surridge joined the meeting.
Martin Moran presented the results of the Javelin study into Post
Office’s progress in expanding its digital and multi-channel offering.

The Board supported the work proposed to deliver the multi-channel
strategy, but emphasised the urgency required. They asked for the
reliance on digital development to be made clear in both the FS
strategy and the wider strategic plan.

The Board recognised that the business needed more focus on the
digital channel. A member of the Executive Committee should take
responsibility for digital, driving the changes in IT infrastructure and
product development to enable the delivery of the strategy.

Concern was expressed about page 7 in the Javelin report which
presented a decline in some brand customer perception measures.
Martin Moran explained that these were recognised measures, which
were reported quarterly. The results included in the report were for
June 2012. The business believed there would be improvements in
the next results. The CFO suggested that these measures be added
to the Business Scorecard reported to the Board

The Board agreed to the implementation of the Digital Programme,
asking for; a Champion on ExCo; to proceed with all urgency; to
work in alignment with the strategic plan; and to bring updates on
progress back to the Board.
