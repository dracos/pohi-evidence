POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF CATHERINE ELIZABETH MACDONALD

|, Catherine Elizabeth Macdonald, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 12" April 2023.

2. | have been retired from the Post Office since October 2016 and this
statement is written in my own words from memory and with the help of the

documents provided by the Inquiry.

BACKGROUND

3. | joined the Post Office in April 1983 as a Data Processing Officer progressing
to a Senior Data Processing Officer in 1986. This involved the keying of data
from the weekly cash account and supporting documents and transfer of data
to magnetic tape and mainframe. In 1996 | became an Input Postal Officer in

the Data Preparation Team which was responsible for the receipt and

Page 1 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

preparation for keying of the weekly cash account and supporting documents,
becoming team leader of this area in 1998 until 2001. | was the Document
Filing and Retrieval team leader before moving in 2002 to a project
environment which included the Payments Processing Outsource Project - the
transfer of cheque processing to an external company EDS (Electronic data

systems | believe) where | remained until October 2005.

. [held the position of Branch Control Manager from October 2005 until March
2012. This was initially a team of 5 Postal Officers and me. The role was to
manage and produce probity reports for several POLFS (Post Office Limited
Financial System) General Ledger (GL) Accounts and Write Off Accounts
including various Suspense Accounts, Discrepancies and Crown Office
accounts, and to provide monthly reports which included Crown Office Loss,
Gains and Crown Transaction Correction Accounts, Local Suspense reports
(also known as Rolling loss reporting), Missing Green Giro enquiry processing
and PIVOT (Correcting transaction volumes). Around 2006/7 following some
large losses involving ‘Cheques at Site’ found at audits | was asked to develop
a process for monitoring values held in this GL Account and to report
branches consistently holding high or increasing values for a special audit.
Shortly afterwards | was asked to do the same for ‘Declared Cash Holdings’
and worked with the Leeds Cash team to identify branches holding excess
cash and for them to arrange its return to the relevant Cash Centre. | worked
with colleagues from around the business — Network Support, Crown Office
CAMS, Security, Cash teams and Audit /Training teams. This led to identifying

new areas of the accounts to monitor including reversals, cash in pouches,

Page 2 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

spoilt/rejected labels and Lottery scratch card holdings. | was also asked to
develop a ‘branch view’ which would enable a user to see e.g. debt,
transaction corrections, cash holdings — declared and generated, and
cheques in one place. This was developed in Excel using the expertise | had
available on the team and became known as a ‘rota check.’ From
approximately 2009 -2011 ‘Multiple partner accounting’ and ‘Multiple partner
debt recovery responsibility was passed to me along with the branch control
duties. Subsequently the number of team members increased to 12. The team
went through a few name changes including Branch Control and
Conformance, however | cannot remember the dates of these changes and
for ease | have consistently referred to the team as ‘Branch Control’

throughout this witness statement.

5. | left Product and Branch Accounting (“P&BA”) in March 2012 to join the
Network Transformation Team and had no further involvement with Branch
Trading, Horizon or the analysis of POLFS and Credence. | have no formal
professional qualifications but have attended numerous Post Office training
courses including Horizon classroom training to enable me to work on the

Crown office counter as strike cover. | left the business in October 2016.

CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY OF SUBPOSTMASTERS FOR SHORTFALLS

6. | have been referred to a number of policy documents relating to the
contractual liability of subpostmasters for shortfalls (POL00083939,

POL00088904, POL00086845, POL00088867, POL00030562,

Page 3 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

POL00113670, POL00086868, POL00090357 and POL00088312) and | have
been asked about my knowledge of these policies.

7. In respect of my understanding when | worked in P&BA of the contractual
position as to the responsibility of the SPMs for shortfalls or ‘losses’ identified,
it was that the SPM was ultimately liable for any transactional accounting
losses and might have been found culpable for any robbery losses. The SPM
was required to sign the weekly cash account and later the monthly Branch
Trading Statement to confirm that it was an accurate picture of their balance

at the said date.

8. | have been referred to Crown Office Network policies POL00084075 and
POL00088124. In respect of how the Post Office policy on the responsibility of
Post Office employees in Crown Offices for shortfalls and losses differs from
the policy of SPMs, Crown office staff were to be subject to various step checks
to identify potential losses, and loss reporting, and escalation processes were
to be in place. My understanding was that the SPM was responsible for the
processes and procedures they put in place in their respective branch.

P&BA AND CROWN OFFICE BRANCHES

9. Asa First line manager my role was primarily to implement policies agreed by
senior managers. On occasions | was asked for input when new polices were
being developed. | remember attending a meeting/ workshop with senior
managers but not the date. The purpose of this meeting was to identify ways
that we could work with Crown Offices to try to reduce their losses. It was
agreed that | would be a P&BA contact for Crown Area Managers and their
Branch Managers, should they be waiting for specific transaction corrections

Page 4 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

(‘TCs’). A report which was produced monthly for Crown Finance Analysts
was to be shared with the Crown Area Managers detailing the top 20 highest
value losses and gains written off to profit and loss along with a new report
detailing the top 10 highest value loss and gain TCs. The change this policy
brought was improved and closer working relationships and losses were

reduced.

P&BA TEAM AND ERROR NOTICES, TRANSACTION CORRECTIONS,

TRANSACTION ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, BRANCH DISCREPANCIES AND

RECOVERY OF DEBT

10.1 have been referred to a number of policy documents relating to error notices,

11.

transaction corrections, transaction acknowledgements and branch
discrepancies (POL00083939, POL00088904, NFSP00000169,
NFSP00000043, POL00085794, POL00030562, POL00083951,
POL00083952, POL00003060, POL00084012, POL00083982,
POL00084075, POL00084076, POL00105417, POL00039089,
POL00001474, POL00113432, POL00086560, POL00088124,
POL00088897, POL00002259, POL00086868, POL00090357,
POL00088312, POL00003060, and POL00039065) and | have been asked

about my knowledge of these policies.

In respect of Error Notices | was not involved with the creation or issue of
these as | had never worked on an Error Resolution team. My only

involvement from 1983 to 2002 was the preparation (batching into 50s),

Page 5 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

keying and transmitting and filing the documents. | knew that they were issued
to correct misbalances on the cash account lines in CBDB — Counters
Business Data Base. | knew that they were brought to account on the cash

account but had no knowledge of any dispute processes.

12.In respect of TCs, my team rarely had cause to issue these so, my knowledge
is limited. My understanding is that they were issued where there was a
mismatch between Horizon data and e.g. Client, Cash, and Stock Centre data
in the ‘Open Item’ managed GL Accounts. These TCs were issued by Postal
Officers on the relevant Error Resolution team. The exceptions | am aware of
were PIVOT volumes where the correct volume was agreed with the SPM and
a TC issued, and in the case of robberies whereby a few days after the
robbery my team member would contact the branch to advise that a TC would
be issued to remove the amount from their ‘Robbery Suspense account’ and
put into a ‘Pending Culpability account.’ It was always concerning if a branch
was receiving a high volume of TCs and any high value TCs over £25k. This
was an indicator of non-conformance, an SPM who may be struggling and
need support in a particular area, or possible suspicious activity. Processes
were put in place around 2009 within P&BA so that the Branch Control Team
could establish if there were any other concerns at the branch, e.g. training
issues, high or increasing debt, and then take any necessary steps, e.g.
training requests or special audits, notifying Contract Advisors, Multiple
Partners, or Crown Office Area Managers. A ‘Large Value Transaction

Correction’ process was put in place in 2009.

Page 6 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

13. The options available to Crown Offices when accepting a TC or completing
Branch Trading were ‘Make Good Cash’ or ‘Write Off to P&L (profit & loss).
The options available to SPMs when accepting a TC or completing Branch
Trading were ‘Make Good Cash,’ ‘Make Good Cheque’ or ‘Settle Centrally’ if
the value was £150 or more. If less than £150 the options were ‘Make Good

Cash’ or ‘Make Good Cheque.’

14.If Crown Office staff found a loss or shortage when balancing their branch
from 2009 they would follow the Crown Office Mandatory Losses and Gains
procedure. If SPMs found a loss or shortage when balancing they would

investigate and action as they had been trained to do.

15.In respect of Transaction Acknowledgements | was not involved with this
process. | was aware of these being issued on the Lottery Team but am
unsure of the date these were introduced or the impact of these on branches

balancing.

16.In respect of Branch Discrepancies | can confirm that prior to Oct 2005 on the
weekly cash account there was a box on the document that had to contain an
entry. If it didn’t, the cash account was returned to the SPM for completion. If
the value of the discrepancy was above a certain amount, (I cannot remember
what it was) then the indicator code on the cash account was changed. The
indicator code was captured as part of the keying procedure, but the value of
the discrepancy was not. From October 2005 | was the owner of the General
Ledger Account Branch Discrepancies. This was an ‘Open Item’ managed
account, which means that any items visible represent uncleared
transactions/postings. In other words, an opposite entry is required to clear

Page 7 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

the open item. Debit and Credit (loss and gain) entries appeared in this
account when the branch had committed/confirmed a discrepancy on Horizon.
Some branches did this daily, some weekly and some branches didn’t create
any entries. As part of the Branch Trading process once the branch
discrepancy had been accepted and transferred to Local Suspense a
compensating entry would appear in the Branch Discrepancy Account GL and
the open items would clear. The entry would then appear in the Local
Suspense Account also, an ‘Open Item’ account. The opposite entry would

appear once the SPM had completed the Branch Trading process.

17.In respect of Debt Recovery my experience and knowledge are limited to the
processes in place for Multiple Partners. These branches had the option to
‘Assign to Nominee’ when accepting TCs and at Branch Trading which gave
visibility of all losses and gains in the respective branch customer account. If a
Partner wished to dispute a TC or Branch Trading discrepancy this was

blocked pending resolution.

18.1 have been referred to the Witness Statement of Susan Harding
(WITN03980100). In respect of the Local Suspense being removed as part of
the IMPACT Programme, my understanding is that prior to October 2005 there
were Suspense Accounts available on the weekly Cash Account where both
Crowns and other branches could record values (losses and gains) when they
were authorised by the NBSC Helpline. My understanding is that these values
would have caused high value discrepancies and the amount could be held in

these suspense accounts pending resolution

Page 8 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

19.1 have been referred to the guidance document “Debt Recovery Processes
under Branch Trading (POL00085794). In respect of the only option open to
an SPM who received a TC from October 2005 being to contact NBSC
Helpline if they did not understand it or wished to challenge it, | cannot confirm
as | cannot remember if this was their only option. Prior to October 2005 |

believe the issuing persons contact details were on the paper Error Notice.

20.In respect of a SPM not able to provide information at the time of the call to
the helpline to show that a TC was issued incorrectly, | can confirm that my
understanding was that if the value was more than £150, they should ‘Accept
and Settle Centrally’. If the amount of the TC was less than £150 the options

would be to Make Good Cash or Cheque.

2

=

.In respect that from October 2005 a SPM identifying a discrepancy which they
considered to have been caused by a system error, the options available to a
SPM would be to call NBSC helpline and seek agreement from P&BA to
‘settle centrally’ whilst the matter was investigated if the value of the
discrepancy was £150 or more. If the discrepancy was a loss or gain of less
than £150 the options available would be to Make Good Cash or Make Good

Cheque whilst the matter was investigated.

22.|n respect of the TC/Debt recovery review document dated 14 November
2008 provided by the Inquiry (POL00001404), | did not know whether ‘settle
centrally’ signifies acceptance of debt liability, as this was not something | was

involved with. This is the first time | have seen this document.

Page 9 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

23.In respect of anything to distinguish a ‘blocked debt’ from an ‘undisputed settle
centrally debt’ | remember seeing the word ‘blocked’ in the narrative section of

a TC or Branch discrepancy on the Customer Line on occasions.

24.\In respect of whether | considered it satisfactory that SPMs were required to
settle centrally even when they disputed a TC/TA/Discrepancy | can confirm
that | accepted that this process had been agreed by the impacted teams/
parties. Given the knowledge | had at the time | had no reason to doubt the
integrity of Horizon. My understanding was that to ‘Settle Centrally ‘meant that
the amount was transferred to the SPM Customer Account pending
investigation and was a mechanism which allowed the branch to rollover into

the next Branch Trading Period.

25.In respect of whether the process for challenging TC’s/TA’s/Discrepancies
meant that a loss was assumed to have been caused by an error or
wrongdoing on the part of the SPM, my view would be that errors could have

been made by e.g. Cash and Stock Centres or Clients as well as SPMs.

26.In respect of the role played by the P&BA team when a SPM challenged a
TC/TA/ Discrepancy, the document (POL00088897) provided to me by the

Inquiry was updated and produced after | left the team so | cannot comment.

27.\In respect of the loss escalation process when a shortfall/ discrepancy was
identified in a Crown Office my recollection is as follows. The Crown Office
manager would follow their guidelines and procedures in identifying the cause
of the shortfall/loss. Once they had identified that a TC was required to

resolve this they would email the Branch Control team inbox with details

Page 10 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

including the dates of the error, stock unit if possible, the product involved and
value. A Branch Control team member would immediately approach the
relevant P&BA team by email, or if high value (over £25k) in person, to
request an investigation. A response would be provided to the Crown Office
and appropriate Crown Area Manager (“CAM”) as soon as possible with the

outcome.

28.In respect of the relationship between the S&E Team , the P&BA Team and
Security team when addressing shortfalls in a Crown Office branch, | cannot
recall what the S&E team refers to. The relationship between P&BA and
Security was such that if there were any concerns, | could have contacted the
Security team and the Crown Office CAMS to discuss any action necessary.
The Crown Office Loss and Gain report was provided to the Security team.
Should | have felt that training issues needed to be addressed | would have

addressed these with the respective CAM.

RECOVERY OF CURRENT AND FORMER AGENTS DEBT

29.1 have been asked to consider documents regarding the Recovery of Current
and Former Agents Debt (POL00083939, POL00088656, POL00084977,
POL00086338, POL00088897, POL00085769, POL00002086, POL00087471,
POL00113670, POLO00086868, POL00090357, and POL00088312) Several of
the documents provided by the Inquiry were written after | had left P&BA. These
are the Fraud & Conformance Team Handover document revised July 2012
(POL00002086), Former Agents Debt Management (POL00087471) and

Operators’ in Service Debt (POL00113670 , POL00086868, POL00090357 and

Page 11 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

POL00088312). | was not involved with the recovery of Current or Former
Agents Debt. There were Current Agents and Former Agents Debt teams within
P&BA. | do not know if anyone within P&BA was involved in the recovery of

debt from current or former Crown Office employees.

30. The Branch Control team would raise concerns with other teams around POL
including the Current Agent Debt team via the Local Suspense Report which
detailed the top 20 losses and gains at Branch Trading. This report was
compiled weekly. Checks would be made on ‘Remedy’ to see if the NBSC.
helpline had been contacted and if there was information regarding the
discrepancy. A check would be made to see how the discrepancy had been
settled - ‘Made Good’ or ‘Settled Centrally,’ and was this a compensating
discrepancy. This information was included on the report along with details of
any TCs which may have accounted for the discrepancy. Where no
information was available to us the branch would be called and we would
have a discussion regarding the cause of the discrepancy if the SPM was
available. Asummary of the discussion would be included on the report. The
Local Suspense report was also shared with the Contract Advisor team and
Security team. The Branch Control team would also share concerns on an ad
hoc basis with the Retail Cash team in Leeds and vice versa. Requests for
training were requested where it was clear that a SPM was struggling in a
particular area. This could be as a result of a discussion with them or the
volume and value of a particular TC. Special audits were also requested on
occasions, at the request of a Contract Advisor or significant concerns in the

Cash ledgers, Cheques at Site ledgers or increasing debt. The Branch Control

Page 12 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

team also worked closely with the Branch Support team to address non-

conformance.

RELIEF FROM ACCOUNTING LOSSES / WRITE-OFF PROCESS

31.1 have been asked to consider documents relating to Relief from accounting
losses / Write-off process (POL00088904, POL00086845, POL00088867,
POL00030562, POL00030562, POL00087409, POL00113670,
POL00086868, POL00090357 and POL00088312). In respect of relief that
could be granted from accounting losses or debt, | was aware that a SPM
could obtain that if they were ‘new SPMS’. When analysing a branch as part
of the Branch Control processes the length of the time the SPM had been in
post was checked and the Contract Advisor informed if a new SPM was found

to be incurring a high level of TCs or high or increasing debt.

CIVIL CLAIMS AND OTHER DEBT RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS

32.1 have been referred to POLO0085008 and asked to describe my involvement
in any analysis or review of the debt recovery process. In respect of Civil
claims and debt recovery proceedings | did not work in this area and cannot

answer the questions listed.

33.In respect of my recollection of the criminal and civil cases listed | was not
involved in any prosecutions or civil actions. The names listed do not mean
anything to me. There are three names where the Inquiry has provided

documents and | will comment on these in turn.

Page 13 of 19
WITNO9100100
WITNO9100100

34. Hughie Thomas (POL00069056_001 to POL00069056_0023). From the
documents provided by the Inquiry | can see that this SPM was suspended in
October 2005 shortly after the Branch Control Team was formed. | do not
recollect any involvement in any investigation into this branch at the time of

his suspension.

35.Seema Misra (POL 00049519). The document provided by the Inquiry shows
an email that | have been copied into by a Security team investigator detailing
a recovery amount. This was normal practice. The branch name is familiar to
me and may have been included in a Local Suspense report but | cannot

remember any details.

36.Rachel Williams (POL00091599). The document provided by the Inquiry
shows an audit report and states that the auditor spoke to me prior to his visit
to the branch. This was standard practice. The auditor would call the Branch
Control team prior to an audit to find out whether any TCs had been issued
and needed to be accepted, and whether there was any outstanding debt at

the branch. | am not familiar with the SPM or Branch Name.

KNOWLEDGE OF BUGS, ERRORS OR DEFECTS IN THE HORIZON SYSTEM

37.In respect of POL00006837, | have read through the document and the name
of the SPM does not mean anything to me. | would assume that the auditor
has stated that he is going to call me to check to see if | have any concerns

regarding debt or transaction corrections.

In respect of concerns I may have had regarding the robustness of the
Horizon IT system whilst | was employed by the Post Office, | can confirm that
| had no knowledge or any concerns regarding the integrity of Horizon data. 1
had no knowledge that the deficiencies in the Horizon system could cause
discrepancies or shortfalls in branch accounts. My understanding was that

Horizon worked correctly and reliably.

' have no other matters that ! wish to bring to the attention of the Chair.

Statement of truth
