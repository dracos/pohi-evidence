                                                                  Dated: 11 May 2023


                       POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




   FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF CATHERINE ELIZABETH MACDONALD




I, Catherine Elizabeth Macdonald, will say as follows:



INTRODUCTION



   1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

      with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 12th April 2023.



   2. I have been retired from the Post Office since October 2016 and this

      statement is written in my own words from memory and with the help of the

      documents provided by the Inquiry.


BACKGROUND



   3. I joined the Post Office in April 1983 as a Data Processing Officer progressing

      to a Senior Data Processing Officer in 1986. This involved the keying of data

      from the weekly cash account and supporting documents and transfer of data

      to magnetic tape and mainframe. In 1996 I became an Input Postal Officer in

      the Data Preparation Team which was responsible for the receipt and
                                     Page 1 of 19
                                                                                    WITNO9100100
                                                                                  WITNO9100100




   preparation for keying of the weekly cash account and supporting documents,

   becoming team leader of this area in 1998 until 2001. I was the Document

   Filing and Retrieval team leader before moving in 2002 to a project

   environment which included the Payments Processing Outsource Project - the

   transfer of cheque processing to an external company EDS (Electronic data

   systems I believe) where I remained until October 2005.



4. I held the position of Branch Control Manager from October 2005 until March

   2012. This was initially a team of 5 Postal Officers and me. The role was to

   manage and produce probity reports for several POLFS (Post Office Limited

   Financial System) General Ledger (GL) Accounts and Write Off Accounts

   including various Suspense Accounts, Discrepancies and Crown Office

   accounts, and to provide monthly reports which included Crown Office Loss,

   Gains and Crown Transaction Correction Accounts, Local Suspense reports

   (also known as Rolling loss reporting), Missing Green Giro enquiry processing

   and PIVOT (Correcting transaction volumes). Around 2006/7 following some

   large losses involving `Cheques at Site' found at audits I was asked to develop

   a process for monitoring values held in this GL Account and to report

   branches consistently holding high or increasing values for a special audit.

   Shortly afterwards I was asked to do the same for `Declared Cash Holdings'

   and worked with the Leeds Cash team to identify branches holding excess

   cash and for them to arrange its return to the relevant Cash Centre. I worked

   with colleagues from around the business — Network Support, Crown Office

   CAMS, Security, Cash teams and Audit /Training teams. This led to identifying

   new areas of the accounts to monitor including reversals, cash in pouches,


                                  Page 2 of 19

                                                                                  WITNO9100100




     spoilt/rejected labels and Lottery scratch card holdings. I was also asked to

     develop a `branch view' which would enable a user to see e.g. debt,

     transaction corrections, cash holdings — declared and generated, and

     cheques in one place. This was developed in Excel using the expertise I had

     available on the team and became known as a'rota check.' From

     approximately 2009 -2011 `Multiple partner accounting' and `Multiple partner

     debt recovery responsibility was passed to me along with the branch control

     duties. Subsequently the number of team members increased to 12. The team

     went through a few name changes including Branch Control and

     Conformance, however I cannot remember the dates of these changes and

     for ease I have consistently referred to the team as `Branch Control'

     throughout this witness statement.



  5. I left Product and Branch Accounting ("P&BA") in March 2012 to join the

     Network Transformation Team and had no further involvement with Branch

     Trading, Horizon or the analysis of POLES and Credence. I have no formal

     professional qualifications but have attended numerous Post Office training

     courses including Horizon classroom training to enable me to work on the

     Crown office counter as strike cover. I left the business in October 2016.



CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY OF SUBPOSTMASTERS FOR SHORTFALLS


  6. I have been referred to a number of policy documents relating to the

     contractual liability of subpostmasters for shortfalls (POL00083939,

     P0L00088904, P0L00086845, P0L00088867, P0L00030562,



                                    Page 3 of 19
                                                                                        WI TNO9100100
                                                                                     WITNO9100100




     POL00113670, POL00086868, POL00090357 and POL00088312) and I have

     been asked about my knowledge of these policies.

  7. In respect of my understanding when I worked in P&BA of the contractual

     position as to the responsibility of the SPMs for shortfalls or `losses' identified,

     it was that the SPM was ultimately liable for any transactional accounting

     losses and might have been found culpable for any robbery losses. The SPM

     was required to sign the weekly cash account and later the monthly Branch

     Trading Statement to confirm that it was an accurate picture of their balance

     at the said date.



  8. I have been referred to Crown Office Network policies POL00084075 and

     POL00088124. In respect of how the Post Office policy on the responsibility of

     Post Office employees in Crown Offices for shortfalls and losses differs from

     the policy of SPMs, Crown office staff were to be subject to various step checks

     to identify potential losses, and loss reporting, and escalation processes were

     to be in place. My understanding was that the SPM was responsible for the

     processes and procedures they put in place in their respective branch.

P&BA AND CROWN OFFICE BRANCHES


  9. As a First line manager my role was primarily to implement policies agreed by

     senior managers. On occasions I was asked for input when new polices were

     being developed. I remember attending a meeting/ workshop with senior

     managers but not the date. The purpose of this meeting was to identify ways

     that we could work with Crown Offices to try to reduce their losses. It was

     agreed that I would be a P&BA contact for Crown Area Managers and their

     Branch Managers, should they be waiting for specific transaction corrections

                                     Page 4 of 19
                                                                                       WITN09100100
                                                                                     WITNO9100100




     ("TCs"). A report which was produced monthly for Crown Finance Analysts

     was to be shared with the Crown Area Managers detailing the top 20 highest

     value losses and gains written off to profit and loss along with a new report

     detailing the top 10 highest value loss and gain TCs. The change this policy

     brought was improved and closer working relationships and losses were

     reduced.




P&BA TEAM AND ERROR NOTICES, TRANSACTION CORRECTIONS,

TRANSACTION ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, BRANCH DISCREPANCIES AND

RECOVERY OF DEBT



  10. 1 have been referred to a number of policy documents relating to error notices,

     transaction corrections, transaction acknowledgements and branch

     discrepancies (POL00083939, POL00088904, NFSP00000169,

     N FSP00000043, P0L00085794, P0L00030562, P0L00083951,

     P0L00083952, P0L00003060, P0L00084012, P0L00083982,

     P0L00084075, P0L00084076, P0L00105417, P0L00039089,

     P0L00001474, P0L00113432, P0L00086560, P0L00088124,

     P0L00088897, P0L00002259, P0L00086868, P0L00090357,

     POL00088312, POL00003060, and POL00039065) and I have been asked

     about my knowledge of these policies.


  11. In respect of Error Notices I was not involved with the creation or issue of

     these as I had never worked on an Error Resolution team. My only

     involvement from 1983 to 2002 was the preparation (batching into 50s),



                                     Page 5 of 19
                                                                                    WITN09100100
                                                                                WITNO9100100




   keying and transmitting and filing the documents. I knew that they were issued

   to correct misbalances on the cash account lines in CBDB — Counters

   Business Data Base. I knew that they were brought to account on the cash

   account but had no knowledge of any dispute processes.



12. In respect of TCs, my team rarely had cause to issue these so, my knowledge

   is limited. My understanding is that they were issued where there was a

   mismatch between Horizon data and e.g. Client, Cash, and Stock Centre data

   in the 'Open Item' managed GLAccounts. These TCs were issued by Postal

   Officers on the relevant Error Resolution team. The exceptions I am aware of

   were PIVOT volumes where the correct volume was agreed with the SPM and

   a TC issued, and in the case of robberies whereby a few days after the

   robbery my team member would contact the branch to advise that a TC would

   be issued to remove the amount from their 'Robbery Suspense account' and

   put into a `Pending Culpability account.' It was always concerning if a branch

   was receiving a high volume of TCs and any high value TCs over £25k. This

   was an indicator of non-conformance, an SPM who may be struggling and

   need support in a particular area, or possible suspicious activity. Processes

   were put in place around 2009 within P&BA so that the Branch Control Team

   could establish if there were any other concerns at the branch, e.g. training

   issues, high or increasing debt, and then take any necessary steps, e.g.

   training requests or special audits, notifying Contract Advisors, Multiple

   Partners, or Crown Office Area Managers. A'Large Value Transaction

   Correction' process was put in place in 2009.

                                                                                      WITN09100100
                                                                                 WITNO9100100




13. The options available to Crown Offices when accepting a TC or completing

   Branch Trading were 'Make Good Cash' or 'Write Off to P&L (profit & loss).

   The options available to SPMs when accepting a TC or completing Branch

   Trading were 'Make Good Cash,' `Make Good Cheque' or `Settle Centrally' if

   the value was £150 or more. If less than £150 the options were 'Make Good

   Cash' or 'Make Good Cheque.'


14. If Crown Office staff found a loss or shortage when balancing their branch

   from 2009 they would follow the Crown Office Mandatory Losses and Gains

   procedure. If SPMs found a loss or shortage when balancing they would

   investigate and action as they had been trained to do.


15. In respect of Transaction Acknowledgements I was not involved with this

   process. I was aware of these being issued on the Lottery Team but am

   unsure of the date these were introduced or the impact of these on branches

   balancing.


16. In respect of Branch Discrepancies I can confirm that prior to Oct 2005 on the

   weekly cash account there was a box on the document that had to contain an

   entry. If it didn't, the cash account was returned to the SPM for completion. If

   the value of the discrepancy was above a certain amount, (I cannot remember

   what it was) then the indicator code on the cash account was changed. The

   indicator code was captured as part of the keying procedure, but the value of

   the discrepancy was not. From October 2005 I was the owner of the General

   Ledger Account Branch Discrepancies. This was an 'Open Item' managed

   account, which means that any items visible represent uncleared

   transactions/postings. In other words, an opposite entry is required to clear

                                  Page 7 of 19
                                                                                   WI TNO9100100
                                                                                 WITN09100100




   the open item. Debit and Credit (loss and gain) entries appeared in this

   account when the branch had committed/confirmed a discrepancy on Horizon.

   Some branches did this daily, some weekly and some branches didn't create

   any entries. As part of the Branch Trading process once the branch

   discrepancy had been accepted and transferred to Local Suspense a

   compensating entry would appear in the Branch Discrepancy Account GL and

   the open items would clear. The entry would then appear in the Local

   Suspense Account also, an 'Open Item' account. The opposite entry would

   appear once the SPM had completed the Branch Trading process.



17. In respect of Debt Recovery my experience and knowledge are limited to the

   processes in place for Multiple Partners. These branches had the option to

   `Assign to Nominee' when accepting TCs and at Branch Trading which gave

   visibility of all losses and gains in the respective branch customer account. If a

   Partner wished to dispute a TO or Branch Trading discrepancy this was

   blocked pending resolution.


18. 1 have been referred to the Witness Statement of Susan Harding

   (WITN03980100). In respect of the Local Suspense being removed as part of

   the IMPACT Programme, my understanding is that prior to October 2005 there

   were Suspense Accounts available on the weekly Cash Account where both

   Crowns and other branches could record values (losses and gains) when they

   were authorised by the NBSC Helpline. My understanding is that these values

   would have caused high value discrepancies and the amount could be held in

   these suspense accounts pending resolution



                                   Page 8 of 19
                                                                                     WITN09100100
                                                                                 WITNO9100100




19. 1 have been referred to the guidance document "Debt Recovery Processes

   under Branch Trading (POL00085794). In respect of the only option open to

   an SPM who received a TC from October 2005 being to contact NBSC

   Helpline if they did not understand it or wished to challenge it, I cannot confirm

   as I cannot remember if this was their only option. Prior to October 2005 I

   believe the issuing persons contact details were on the paper Error Notice.


20. In respect of a SPM not able to provide information at the time of the call to

   the helpline to show that a TC was issued incorrectly, I can confirm that my

   understanding was that if the value was more than £150, they should `Accept

   and Settle Centrally'. If the amount of the TC was less than £150 the options

   would be to Make Good Cash or Cheque.


21. In respect that from October 2005 a SPM identifying a discrepancy which they

   considered to have been caused by a system error, the options available to a

   SPM would be to call NBSC helpline and seek agreement from P&BA to

   `settle centrally' whilst the matter was investigated if the value of the

   discrepancy was £150 or more. If the discrepancy was a loss or gain of less

   than £150 the options available would be to Make Good Cash or Make Good

   Cheque whilst the matter was investigated.


22. In respect of the TC/Debt recovery review document dated 14 November

   2008 provided by the Inquiry (POL00001404), I did not know whether `settle

   centrally' signifies acceptance of debt liability, as this was not something I was

   involved with. This is the first time I have seen this document.




                                   Page 9 of 19
                                                                                    WI TNO9100100
                                                                                  WITNO9100100




23. In respect of anything to distinguish a `blocked debt' from an 'undisputed settle

   centrally debt' I remember seeing the word blocked' in the narrative section of

   a TC or Branch discrepancy on the Customer Line on occasions.


24. In respect of whether I considered it satisfactory that SPMs were required to

   settle centrally even when they disputed a TC/TA/Discrepancy I can confirm

   that I accepted that this process had been agreed by the impacted teams/

   parties. Given the knowledge I had at the time I had no reason to doubt the

   integrity of Horizon. My understanding was that to `Settle Centrally 'meant that

   the amount was transferred to the SPM Customer Account pending

   investigation and was a mechanism which allowed the branch to rollover into

   the next Branch Trading Period.


25. In respect of whether the process for challenging TC's/TA's/Discrepancies

   meant that a loss was assumed to have been caused by an error or

   wrongdoing on the part of the SPM, my view would be that errors could have

   been made by e.g. Cash and Stock Centres or Clients as well as SPMs.


26. In respect of the role played by the P&BA team when a SPM challenged a

   TC/TA/ Discrepancy, the document (POL00088897) provided to me by the

   Inquiry was updated and produced after I left the team so I cannot comment.


27. In respect of the loss escalation process when a shortfall/ discrepancy was

   identified in a Crown Office my recollection is as follows. The Crown Office

   manager would follow their guidelines and procedures in identifying the cause

   of the shortfall/loss. Once they had identified that a TC was required to

   resolve this they would email the Branch Control team inbox with details


                                  Page 10 of19
                                                                                     WI TNO9100100
                                                                                   WITNO9100100




     including the dates of the error, stock unit if possible, the product involved and

     value. A Branch Control team member would immediately approach the

     relevant P&BA team by email, or if high value (over £25k) in person, to

     request an investigation. A response would be provided to the Crown Office

     and appropriate Crown Area Manager ("CAM") as soon as possible with the

     outcome.


  28. In respect of the relationship between the S&E Team , the P&BA Team and

     Security team when addressing shortfalls in a Crown Office branch, I cannot

     recall what the S&E team refers to. The relationship between P&BA and

     Security was such that if there were any concerns, I could have contacted the

     Security team and the Crown Office CAMS to discuss any action necessary.

     The Crown Office Loss and Gain report was provided to the Security team.

     Should I have felt that training issues needed to be addressed I would have

     addressed these with the respective CAM.



RECOVERY OF CURRENT AND FORMER AGENTS DEBT



  29. I have been asked to consider documents regarding the Recovery of Current

     and Former Agents Debt (POL00083939, POL00088656, POL00084977,

     P0L00086338, P0L00088897, P0L00085769, P0L00002086, P0L00087471,

     POL00113670, POL00086868, POL00090357, and POL00088312) Several of

     the documents provided by the Inquiry were written after I had left P&BA. These

     are the Fraud & Conformance Team Handover document revised July 2012

     (POL00002086), Former Agents Debt Management (POL00087471) and

     Operators' in Service Debt (POL00113670 , POL00086868, POL00090357 and

                                    Page 11 of 19
                                                                                    WI TNO9100100
                                                                                 WITN09100100




   POL00088312). I was not involved with the recovery of Current or Former

   Agents Debt. There were Current Agents and Former Agents Debt teams within

   P&BA. I do not know if anyone within P&BA was involved in the recovery of

   debt from current or former Crown Office employees.



30. The Branch Control team would raise concerns with other teams around POL

   including the Current Agent Debt team via the Local Suspense Report which

   detailed the top 20 losses and gains at Branch Trading. This report was

   compiled weekly. Checks would be made on `Remedy' to see if the NBSC

   helpline had been contacted and if there was information regarding the

   discrepancy. A check would be made to see how the discrepancy had been

   settled — 'Made Good' or `Settled Centrally,' and was this a compensating

   discrepancy. This information was included on the report along with details of

   any TCs which may have accounted for the discrepancy. Where no

   information was available to us the branch would be called and we would

   have a discussion regarding the cause of the discrepancy if the SPM was

   available. A summary of the discussion would be included on the report. The

   Local Suspense report was also shared with the Contract Advisor team and

   Security team. The Branch Control team would also share concerns on an ad

   hoc basis with the Retail Cash team in Leeds and vice versa. Requests for

   training were requested where it was clear that a SPM was struggling in a

   particular area. This could be as a result of a discussion with them or the

   volume and value of a particular TC. Special audits were also requested on

   occasions, at the request of a Contract Advisor or significant concerns in the

   Cash ledgers, Cheques at Site ledgers or increasing debt. The Branch Control

     team also worked closely with the Branch Support team to address non-

     conformance.



RELIEF FROM ACCOUNTING LOSSES / WRITE-OFF PROCESS


  31. I have been asked to consider documents relating to Relief from accounting

     losses / Write-off process (POL00088904, P0L00086845, POL00088867,

     P0L00030562, P0L00030562, P01-00087409, P01-00113670,

     P0L00086868, POL00090357 and P0L00088312). In respect of relief that

     could be granted from accounting losses or debt, I was aware that a SPM

     could obtain that if they were 'new SPMS'. When analysing a branch as part

     of the Branch Control processes the length of the time the SPM had been in

     post was checked and the Contract Advisor informed if a new SPM was found

     to be incurring a high level of TCs or high or increasing debt.



CIVIL CLAIMS AND OTHER DEBT RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS


  32. I have been referred to POL00085008 and asked to describe my involvement

     in any analysis or review of the debt recovery process. In respect of Civil

     claims and debt recovery proceedings I did not work in this area and cannot

     answer the questions listed.



  33. In respect of my recollection of the criminal and civil cases listed I was not

     involved in any prosecutions or civil actions. The names listed do not mean

     anything to me. There are three names where the Inquiry has provided

     documents and I will comment on these in turn.

                                                                                  WITNO9100100




  34. Hughie Thomas (POL00069056_001 to POL00069056_0023). From the

     documents provided by the Inquiry I can see that this SPM was suspended in

     October 2005 shortly after the Branch Control Team was formed. I do not

     recollect any involvement in any investigation into this branch at the time of

     his suspension.


  35. Seema Misra (POL 00049519). The document provided by the Inquiry shows

     an email that I have been copied into by a Security team investigator detailing

     a recovery amount. This was normal practice. The branch name is familiar to

     me and may have been included in a Local Suspense report but I cannot

     remember any details.


  36. Rachel Williams (POL00091599). The document provided by the Inquiry

     shows an audit report and states that the auditor spoke to me prior to his visit

     to the branch. This was standard practice. The auditor would call the Branch

     Control team prior to an audit to find out whether any TCs had been issued

     and needed to be accepted, and whether there was any outstanding debt at

     the branch. I am not familiar with the SPM or Branch Name.



KNOWLEDGE OF BUGS, ERRORS OR DEFECTS IN THE HORIZON SYSTEM


  37. In respect of POL00006837, I have read through the document and the name

     of the SPM does not mean anything to me. I would assume that the auditor

     has stated that he is going to call me to check to see if I have any concerns

     regarding debt or transaction corrections.
