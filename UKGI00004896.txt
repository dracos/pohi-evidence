George

Further to our conversation earlier, please see attached a short update on the Post Office Horizon issue. It would be
helpful if SoS could see this overnight, particularly given he may be asked about this matter if he attends the MP’s
drop-in reception that Post Office are hosting tomorrow afternoon (Wednesday).

Let me know if you need anything else.

Andrew - this is a short summary update on the events since the adjournment debate, up to the letters that your
Minister sent out to the MP and to POL last week. No new information since we have not received any response to the
letters from either Mr Bridgen or POL (although we understand one from POL is on its way shortly).

Thanks
Laura
