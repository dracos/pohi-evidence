Subject: Criteria for Restarting High Volume Pilot

Importance: High

All,

I was asked to provide some criteria for re-starting the High Volume Pilot. I’ve had a long conversation with Will about what POL
will be looking for. The new POL MD, Dave Smith (from Parcelforce) started today, and has met with the HNG-X POL Team. He is
likely to take a more cautious stance towards re-starting the pilot. The National Federation of Sub-postmasters will not allow any
more of their members’ branches to be migrated to HNG-X for the time being. The likely way forward is that POL will look to deploy
HNG-X to all their Crown offices first, to prove that the system works and to persuade the Federation to continue. My “starter for
ten” for discussion at 7 p.m. is:-

1. No BAL failures in live for a period of at least 1 week. [ADA: Is this still the case if the BAL fails over without any service
impact?]

2. No Branch Database failures in live for a period of at least 1 week. [ADA: Same as 1 above]

3. No recurrence of the Banking card and CAPO transaction errors seen in live on 01/04/10 and 06/04/10 for at least 1 week.
[ADA: I don’t understand what the errors are. It is part of business as usual for transactions not to be completed and captured
through the BIMs process]

4. Root causes identified for outages seen over last 2 weeks (Branch Database nodes failing and Banking/CAPO transaction
failures seen 01/04/10 and 06/04/10).[ADA: Agreed]

5. A significant reduction in the number of Oracle 3136 error messages seen in live. [ADA: What is the point of this? The
main issue around Oracle 3136 errors was that it sent the BRDB into a non recoverable ‘spin’ which led to catastrophic
failures]

6. Eventing and monitoring deliveries in place to improve how issues are diagnosed (DK was picking this up — was due to be
in place by 02/04/10 but have not seen feedback on this).

7. Evidence that live issues are being resolved, with fixes scheduled and the HSD are not incorrectly routing calls to NBSC.
[ADA: There are two different issues here]

8. Confirmation of the maintenance release schedule and a candidate content list for each in terms of business impacting
issues.

9. Evidence from capacity management team stats to support view that infrastructure and application can support increased
numbers of branches. [ADA: Agreed — but we need to set the thresholds for success]

Regards,

Geoff
