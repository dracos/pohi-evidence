1am so lucky to have such great colleagues to work with!

Thank you Mark this is very clear and helpful. I'm grateful for all the obvious thinking and
planning going on.

Thanks also to Jane for her rigour and drive on the legal and mediation side.

If the outcome could be judged by integrity and commitment then the programme would have
been pulled by now.

I'm reassured by your note Mark. It's a good brief for both Al and I, if we are drawn into a
Sparrow discussion over dinner.

Tom, could you reformat the planning grid, so that I can view easily on iPad tomorrow. (I can see
the gist of it but not easily.)

Cheers,
Paula

This is the latest position:

The programme is due to air on June 29. Our approach is as follows:
Panorama engagement

We have been engaging with Panorama's producers/reporters on a daily basis. We
held a two hour on the record briefing session with them last Tuesday. They have
since sent a long set of questions, to which we responded in detail today. They have
not put any new allegations to us. They withheld a number of questions from the
briefing [a strong point if we are to argue bad faith].

We have been engaging at this level in order to seek to flush out whether they have
any new information. As they appear not to, we are now escalating to Panorama
editor level. I have requested a meeting with him (Ceri Thomas). We are speaking
tomorrow. Subject to that conversation, I will be escalating to his superiors and
ultimately James Harding, director of news and current affairs. This will take place
tomorrow. This is in addition to an ongoing dialogue with Malcolm Balen, who
heads editorial complaints.

This is the right sequence of events: to have gone higher before flushing out the
reporters [and giving us a strong evidence base off which to make representations]
would likely have led to 'doorstepping' tactics.

We are also keeping the possibility of an on camera interview with Angela alive, but
have concluded that Panorama plans to use this only to put questions about
individual cases to us, in order to create a television moment [where we do not
answer]. We have not, however, informed Panorama of this position in order to keep
channels open.

Panorama has approached BIS, Fujitsu and Second Sight. We have written tonight to
Second Sight reminding them of their terms of engagement. We are liaising with
Fujitsu and BIS.

Brunswick are up to date with developments and support our approach. They have
conducted media training with Angela.

Legal avenues

We met with external legal teams last Wednesday and are in daily contact. Our media
lawyers are preparing a letter for BBC lawyers which we will deploy tactically at the
right moment: we don't want to go too early while there is still a chance, albeit
limited, that they will pull the programme, or move it. If and when we do deploy, this
will be a robust approach highlighting the BBC's lack of evidence and continued.
focus on the issue. We are working up details of how much we will say about
individual cases, particularly on a lawyer to lawyer basis, without losing the moral
high ground.

Communications planning

POL00117421

POL00117421

It is critical if Panorama does broadcast the kind of programme we expect that we
have communicated our messages, confidently, to our people and particularly all
those who communicate with customers and teams who connect with
postmasters/branch staff. I have drawn up a very comprehensive plan which I will
send to you. In short I have consulted with relevant GE and other senior colleagues
and will be holding a series of conference call briefings next week as well as ensuring
materials and lines to take are communicated. I have drawn up a detailed day by day
plan of action. This will include a filmed interview with Angela for internal and
external use and a (subject to your view) a message from you.

We will also take a robust external response. If Panorama seeks to generate publicity
for its programme we will go into all out attack. We will also for possible use
develop a proactive statement to run ahead of the programme to set out our position
in advance and raise questions about the programme. We will agree to media bids if
other BBC outlets run the story: I will do these and be robust. We will also arrange a
live social media session when Panorama is airing to issue in real time corrections and
clarifications.

I have copied the current overall plan below: you will see one or two gaps where
colleagues were unsure of right person/people, and indeed today it has gone to
colleagues across the business for input. I am planning as you will see to update GE
at the end of the week, but given your request I am sending this to you now with a
health warning it is work in progress. And as I am on ipad it may appear oddly. I
hope it gives a sense of the comprehensive nature of the plan. One issue not here
which I am considering is whether we will need customer facing branch collateral: my
instinct is not, but we will prepare for all eventualities. Pete and I are in touch and
discussing all relevant points from his perspective.

T hope this helps.

Mark

Dear all,

I would really appreciate the detail of what we have done, who we have
engaged with, our legal activity, our view, why and what tack we have
taken and why, etc., to mitigate the Panorama coverage of Sparrow.
And how to answer the Board's likely question of what more could we
have done, have we tried a serious legal approach and if not, why not?

Remember they are not experts in either of your disciplines and may be
worried. They will be best reassured if we can demonstrate we have
taken control and how (Angela, lines, etc).
