Thanks Andy
No, you’re not confused I I didn’t realise there had also been this separate Credence incident. I attach revised briefing
which now includes mention of it

Also re-attach the draft internal email for Credence users but see no reason to change this {as per previous emails
intended recipients are people already well in the loop with Credence issues)

Mel

Please find attached my comments on the Group Lit comms.

In relation to Credence, I think this might be confusing two separate credence issues. The first issue is the delay of
transactions, which has been going on for a while. The second issue (that arose recently) was duplicate
transactions. See attached letter for a very brief explanation of this.

Your draft comms focus only on the first issue, but did you want to cover the second one too? Or have I got myself totally
confused as what is going on?!

Hi both

I attach the draft comms for next week. I have tracked changes to the lines Jane M sent earlier in the week and made a
few additions.

Once I have your comments I can polish the bullets into appropriate emails for the various internal audiences, such as
NBSC, field advisors ete who will need to be equipped with basis info in case of queries. Mark has requested that I go
through with him Monday ahead of the meeting.

For wider audiences obviously our stance (which we will keep under review) will be as reactive as possible.

I have also attached a reactive media brief on the current Credence matter and a draft email that will shortly be going to
Credence users only (around 300 people who have been receiving communications about it and understand the
context). Grateful for any comments on these too.

V'll be keeping a watch on social media to see if next week’s hearing starts to get mentioned amongst the usual
people. They will doubtless have a PR plan ready to try to attract attention. Co-incidentally we are doing some PR
around banking framework next week, which is very good news in terms of demonstrating business and client
confidence (but our claimants might attempt to adversely comment on the back of it of course).

Many thanks
