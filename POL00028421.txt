the way Horizon passes information through to TIP. These relate to the provision of
balanced outlet cash accounts and the processing of the ensuing information via TIP. Whilst

Areview meeting was held with TIP management in Chesterfield last week. Asaresultof ~_
this a number of problems were designated for further work by the end of today
(Monday 16 Nov). This work will be reviewed by Horizon Release Management prior toa
meeting of all interested parties in Feltham on Wednesday/Thursday this week.

By the end of Thursday we need to have detailed problem statements, proposed solutions
and an assessment of the knock on impact on Testing timescales and subsequent milestones.
There is no indication that any consequent delay would involve moving the commencement
of national rollout outside my July - Sept 99 window.

Ihave been written to by Vince Gaskell the CAPS Project Director in BA about this issue and
have promised him a meaningful response by this Friday (20 November). At that time we
must assume that what I reveal will be availabletoBAand DSS...
