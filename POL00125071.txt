    Extract from Settlement Policy

    B                      cases
              Criminal




    Background
    1.1  Offering a settlement to an Applicant who has been convicted could:

              1.1.1      Be used as the basis for an appeal against that conviction; and/or

              1.1.2      Cause that conviction to become unsafe.

    1.2       As such, settlements involving convicted Applicants should only be offered where there is clear
              evidence of a miscarriage of justice and the process below has been followed.


    Process
    1.3   Where a Complaint relates to an Applicant who has been convicted, the following additional
          processes should be followed:

              1.3.1      The Applicant's application, case questionnaire and any investigation findings should be
                         forwarded to Post Office's criminal lawyers (Cartwright King — "CK")

              1.3.2      CK will review the above documents to determine whether any disclosure is required under
                         Post Office's prosecution duties.

              1.3.3      CK will be consulted on any Recommendation for Settlement and advise how the proposed
                         settlement may affect the Applicant's conviction.

    1.4       Post Office has no power to overturn a conviction. If, following the investigation phase, grounds for
              appeal are identified, the standard approach will be to:

              1.4.1      Suspend the standard mediation process.
                                                                     1



                                                                                                                     WBDTr_007192
                                                                                                                       POL-0131075
                                                                                                                                POLOO125071
                                                                                                                              POLD0125071




                                                                                                                                             L1
               1.4.2                       Disclose the information giving rise to the grounds for appeal to the Applicant (via CK).

               1.4.3                       Consider whether Post Office will support or oppose any appeal.

               1.4.4                       Consider whether Post Office might offer financial support to the Applicant in order to
                                           conduct the appeal.

               1.4.5                       Consider whether it is more appropriate to conduct the mediation before or after any appeal
                                           is heard. In most cases, it will be more appropriate for the appeal to be heard first.

               1.4.6                       Write to the Applicant explaining Post Office's stance on the above matters and seek their
                                           views on how they wish to proceed.

               1.4.7                       Where a conviction is overturned on appeal, mediation may subsequently be used to resolve
                                           the Applicant's claims / losses that flow from that wrongful conviction.

Martin

Please find attached the latest applications into the mediation Scheme (I've split this into two parts and will send the
second half by separate email).

This bundle of applications includes our first two Case Questionnaires that provide further details on those two cases

Are you generally reviewing these applications to see if they give rise to any disclosable material (I expect so - but
best to double check!)? This point was raised by Tony Hooper at our meeting last Friday. He also thought that it was
"obvious" that as part of its disclosure duties, Post Office should be disclosing anonymised details of each application
in prosecutions where Horizon is being questioned. In response, I sat squarely on the fence and said that the
applications would be reviewed and proper disclosures made as required.

Also, SS believe that they have "lots of information" that may be relevant to Defendants and asked whether PO
should be disclosing this material. Tony said that such information was       under POL's control (as SS were
                                                                                             not




independent) so it was for SS to decide whether to send this information to POL - so just a heads up on this point but
I hope that SS won't actually be bothered to do anything about this.

                                                                                 2
