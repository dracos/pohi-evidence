Pete

I should tell you that January 2006 has not been included in the return for West Byfleet.

By the time I was able to retrieve the records for January there were only a couple of days available. Knowing
that we had received audit and helpdesk call requests for West Byfleet for this timeframe it was my intention to
substitute with previously retrieved records and supply the whole month (although I would not have the data
files). Unfortunately, when I searched for the records they were not there and checking the ARQ request I see
that only helpdesk calls were requested at the time.

Kind regards
Penny

Yes, unless Simon sends me a mail to add to the Second Sight work which will then come through me.
Thanks

Thank you, Pete.

So, just to make sure I understand correctly, West Byfleet is the last in the Horizon Integrity Audit exercise and
the remainder of the outlets will be requested via the ARQ Service against POL’s service quota. Is that right?

Kind regards
Penny

I discussed the ‘extra’ branches not in the control spreadsheet with Simon Baker and he stated it was a
misunderstanding of the Second Sight work and these other branches should come through the normal process and
be chargeable.

Hope this helps

Our agreed process is that Fujitsu supply the Security Fraud Team in Salford with the encryption passphrase and
they distribute to other interested parties in POL. Their email address is:-

Post_Office_Securit: (

Charlie should contact them; they are headed by Jayne Bradbury, Security Manager.

Hi Dave
I am unable to decrypt them as I have been unable to locate an encryption code for them.

For the branches at the end of your list (I think 9 onwards) we haven’t had the data requests in from the investigators
specifying the date ranges.
