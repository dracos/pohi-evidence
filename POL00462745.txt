Dear Mr Marshall

Your client: Oyeteju Adedayo

Our client: Post Office Limited ("Post Office")

We are writing with regard to the announcement on 10 January 2024 that the Department
for Business and Trade ("DBT") will be bringing forward legislation to overturn the convictions
of all those convicted in England or Wales on the basis of Post Office evidence given during
the Horizon scandal and allow for the recovery of compensation. DBT will also be engaging
with the Scottish and Northern Irish Administrations in respect of convictions in their
jurisdictions. More details of the announcement made to Parliament can be found at
https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-01-10/debates/3DDD9684-C08D-4ESE-
AF73-CF858394 12AB/PostOfficeHorizonScandal.

As we foreshadowed in our 16 January letter, Post Office and DBT have actively been
considering the approach to the existing so-called "Public Interest" cases in light of this
development.

Notwithstanding that the proposed legislation is yet to be enacted, given Ms Adedayo has
already had her conviction overturned, DBT has confirmed that she will now be treated as
eligible to claim compensation in the same way as other Claimants whose convictions have
been overturned.

We are conscious that Ms Adedayo has already settled her claims. As such, it is proposed
that she be entitled to claim top-up compensation to the extent that would put her in the same
position as other claimants with overturned convictions. In the meantime, the settlement
payment received by Ms Adedayo pursuant to the settlement agreement dated 30 January
2023 would be treated as an interim payment on account of her damages.

Subject to the above, Ms Adedayo will now therefore be able to either accept the £600,000
DBT Up Front Offer or proceed to a full assessment of her non-pecuniary and pecuniary
claims and receive compensation accordingly.

Post Office hopes this comes as welcome news to Ms Adedayo but please let us know if you
have any queries or would like to discuss.

Yours faithfully
