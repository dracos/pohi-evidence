Tony
We have checked up to page 45 of the Defence, please find attached a clean version and comparison to version 115.
The amendments are:

* Typos and some small tweaks

e — Cross referencing

e — Input by Post Office IT's director to paragraphs 50(1) and 59

« Amendments from your conversation with Andy this morning

There are a couple of cross references which were are unsure of, if you search the document for "Tony" you will find
these.

We will send over any tweaks to the remainder of the defence shortly and if we could have your comments on the
cross referencing / amendments by this evening that would be much appreciated.

Kind regards

Amy
