Dear Sir

Re: R v Grant Allen

Chester Crown Court T20120537

PCMH 10 December 2012

Thank you for your letter of the 24 November 2012.

An independent review of the Horizon system has been due to take place for several
months now, although my understanding is that at present, the number of cases to be
considered is still yet to be determined. I am not aware of any time frame for publication
of a final report. Upon receipt of the report we will of course consider it under our
continuing duty of disclosure and provide a copy if appropriate.

Thope this is of assistance.

Yours sincerely

Andrew Bolc
Solicitor
