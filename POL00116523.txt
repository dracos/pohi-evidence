One of the actions for me at the board sub committee yesterday was to think about the context of the Linklaters letter in creating a
wider narrative which might set the scene for next steps.

I have in the attached started the process of bringing together a full report on the Horizon issue, starting from appointment of SS
through to now, and the Linklaters letter.

It obviously needs work but will I hope help Sophie and Rodric as they discuss today. I would also welcome other views on this.
Thave been thinking also that this could form a report on Horizon which we submit to the minister to support future actions. It
provides in my view a pretty comprehensive picture, both in terms of the nature of the complaints but also the breadth and
thoroughness of our actions.
