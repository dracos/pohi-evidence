law - No Attribute Grammar Catalogue

the ability to interrogate TMS Journals is an integral element of the Audit
solution that we supply to POCL. The interrogations are achieved using
IR-Query and constructing SQL type query statements. The structure of the TMS
records is complex and uses Attribute Grammar to establish identities for the
record attributes. There is currently no definitive catalogue of the
attribute grammer used in the Horizon solution which makes the construction
of an R-Query statement to meet a customer's business enquiry difficult, time
consuming and very ‘hit and miss'. A comprehensive ATG, providing details of
the attribute charateristics would improve the efficiency of this part of the
audit Solution.
