We need to consider how this impacts on the investigation into the Horizon system and what we have said we would do about
pursuing recoveries while that investigation is on-going.

Andy Pheasant — can you please give me a call to discuss this when you get a moment?
Thanks, Rodric

Dear all

Please see details from a Former Agent who has already pleaded guilty and been sentenced to 12 months
