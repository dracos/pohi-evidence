Amy,

There is no list of those KELs that were deleted beyond retrieval, i.e. those in category 2.a) in the email
below, therefore the existence of such a KEL can only be surmised by it being referenced elsewhere (that is,
on the assumption that any such reference has been typed correctly.)

Hi Matthew

Do you know how many KELs would fall within the category: "Deleted KELs that are no longer retrievable"?

Many thanks

Amy,

Please see my comments below. No need for apologies, I think I have now made it clearer below (including

to myself).

HI Matthew

Apologies, if you have explained these points before but please could I clarify a couple of queries on the Known Error

Log:

ae

PinICL system — it is correct that the PinICL entries are stored on an access database which is accessible?
[Matthew Lenton] There are two Access databases that contain some details of archived PinICLs, but
they were created some years ago by someone who has been retired for several years, and our
understanding is that they appear to be incomplete both in terms of a) not containing all of the
original information that was stored against those PinICL details that they do contain, and b) not
containing between them all of the PinICLs that existed. We are not sure of the criteria that was used
for selecting the PinICLs to be archived. We have provided details of some PinlICLs, but for the
reasons given above, we don’t believe that it is necessarily reliable.

Deleted KELs - are not retrievable? Or were provided to us on 5 November 2018 (see attached email chain —
email on 12 Dec @ 16:30)?

[Matthew Lenton] There are two categories of Deleted:

a) Deleted KELs that are no longer retrievable due to being completely deleted, before SSC
started saving them into a “Deleted table”. These cannot be provided, and if a KEL is
referred to by us as not being retrievable, and, I believe, all KELs that are referred to in
Coyne’s report as not having been disclosed, then they fall into this category.

b) Deleted KELs that are retrievable due to being deleted into a “Deleted table”. These
would no longer be included in any SSC searches, even by changing the default search
criteria as described in 3 below. We believe that the functionality to save a deleted KEL
was introduced in July 2008; however, the dates of KELs within the deleted table are based
on when the KEL was created, rather than when it was deleted, so it is not completely clear
when the change occurred (and noting that there could be retrievable KELs in that table
which we have provided that are older than KELs that are not retrievable, due to when

they were deleted). This is the set we provided in November.

Deactivated KELs — these were provided to us in the extract in March 2018, or on 5 November 2018?
[Matthew Lenton] These are KELs that have not been deleted into the “Deleted table” but are excluded
from SSC’s default searches, which focus on Live KELs, but can be included easily by changing
search criteria. These were provided in the original set in March.

Deprecated KEL - these were provided to us in the extract in March 2018, or on 5 November 2018?[Matthew
Lenton] When a KEL is updated, the old version of that same KEL is deprecated, so these are
superseded versions of live or deactivated KELs. We have only provided the most recent versions, so
we have not separately provided these superseded versions. Note that there are no deprecated
versions of KELs in the category 2a) — i.e. if a KEL was deleted prior to the introduction of the Deleted
table function then all versions were deleted.

WBON0001430

5. Live KELs — these were provided to us in March 18 and December 18.[Matthew Lenton] These were
provided in March, with those in category 3 above.

6. Other KELs — are there are other types of KELs which do not fall within the above catergories?/Matthew
Lenton] No, the above categories 2 to 5 cover all KELs.

Many thanks

Lucy,

We’ ve located an archive of PinICL entries which contains some of the calls you listed, though not all, as
annotated on the list in your email below, noting that I have also added in the references that you asked about
on 31-Jan-2019, and the archived records for those are attached. The archiving was done some years ago as
an export to Access, and this Excel extract is identical in format to the Access records, so clearly any original
formatting from the PinICL system has been lost.

Dates for the PinICLs that I have supplied are on the sheet, for those we don’t have we have no other
information regarding dates other than what is suggested in the report.

The KELs listed below are all deleted rather than deprecated or archived, and are therefore not retrievable.

Matthew,

Jason Coyne has referred to a number of Peaks / KELs in his supplemental report that he states have not been
disclosed. Can you let me know why they are not in the PEAK / KEL extracts we have received from you? Is it
because they were all from the system "PinICL"? If you can provide any dates relating to them that would be
appreciated.

The list is as follows:

 PC0021327 [Matthew Lenton] Not in PinICL Archive.
