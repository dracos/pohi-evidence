Hi Jonny,

Sounds good.

In brief, my priority list is as follows:

CCRC questions on the KEL in the attached (POL have had these since late 2016 and they are still not in front of FJ)

CCRC questions re transaction logs in the attached (POL have had these since Jan)

FOIA question in the attached (this could affect how POL deals with future FOIA requests for KEL entries)

I wouldn't have thought any of these questions should take long for FJ to answer once someone properly engages with
them.

Let me know when you want to talk about priorities then I'm happy to do a first draft of the email we're pulling together
for Rod to send (although it probably makes sense for us to draft our respective bits of this).

Thanks

Paul

Paul,

There are only two things on my FJ list once the remote access paper has been delivered (due Wed). Do you want to

produce a first draft of the list and then we can talk to discuss priority?

Thanks

Yes the meeting with FJ happened but at a very high-level. FJ are currently focused on producing a technical paper
on the remote access question, and they can only really do one thing at a time!

I think we need to draw up a priority list for FJ engagement to stop them getting swamped.

Jonny / Paul — can you speak and put together that list? And then perhaps an email to go from Rod to Chris Jay at FJ
setting this out? Good idea? Say if you disagree.

On Adedayo, from memory the logs were not available because of the age of the case — she was convicted in 2006.
That said, I cannot find any email exchange on this specific point so I think it is worth double checking with POL
(maybe Shirley could confirm?) given that Freeths have asked the question.

On the KELs, I put together a list of questions to go to FJ covering the CCRC investigation, FOIA requests and the
Group Action — see attached. POL has not yet gone back to the CCRC on the KEL to my knowledge.

Andy — I remember you mentioning a meeting between POL and FJ where this list of questions for FJ would be
discussed/put in context. Has that meeting now happened? It would be good to discuss this when you have a moment
in case this has fallen between the cracks.

Thanks

Paul

Thanks Paul — the question on Adedayo was whether POL had been able to locate the Helpline call logs. Freeths
have requested disclosure of these but Andy thought that Post Office had had some issues locating these.

Yes, of course.
Sorry I've been tied up today. I can dig out the stuff on the KELs tomorrow.
We don't have a huge amount of docs on Adedayo — just the electronic security stuff — but happy to discuss.
