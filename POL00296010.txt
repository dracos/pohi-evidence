Dear Mr Thompson,

So close to Christmas and with delays in the mail, I have attached a pdf of a letter to you which is self-
explanatory about a forthcoming investigation into the Post Office Horizon system which I believe will
benefit your members. If you so wish, it could be published in the Subpostmaster Magazine.

Once January arrives there will be significant press coverage about this investigation in order to ensure
the widest possible audience is reached.

If you have any questions about this please do not hesitate to contact me.
Alan Bates

Chairman
Justice For Subpostmasters Alliance
