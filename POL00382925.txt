Sophie

Each case is considered individually . I would suggest the following wording :

Whilst POL has as matter of policy treats offences of theft and fraud seriously following any investigation it remains
appropriate for Lawyers to consider each case on its own facts, having regards to the facts of each case and the code
for crown prosecutors.

Thanks Jarnail that helps with regard to the first question but not the second ‘what is our prosecution policy’ — we
need to be able to explain why some are prosecuted and others not.

Thanks

I would suggest formulation of wording such as to why POL are not proceeding with prosecutions Abbas and
Daw.

e Issues arising out of the Selsey Road Post Office in Birmingham have been investigated.

e In order to consider whether or not to commence a prosecution against Abbas and Daw POL has
had regard to the two tests set out in The Code for Crown Prosecutors.

e The first test to be considered is the evidential test and if there is sufficient evidence to justify a
prosecution, prosecutors must then go on to consider whether a prosecution is required in the public
interest.

e The evidence in this case has been reviewed and POL has decided that a prosecution in relation to
Abbas and Daw is not required in the public interest.

I would suggest formulation of wording such as to why POL are not proceeding with prosecution against
Rees;
e Mr. Rees was investigated following the discovery of a shortage of cash by auditors.
e The Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out two tests; the evidential test and, if that is satisfied, the
public interest test.
e The evidence in this case has been fully reviewed and it has been concluded that there is insufficient
evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction at this time.
e Hope this helps.

Andy and Rodric,
\f we were to be asked by the press:

e Why have you dropped these prosecution cases?
e@ What is your prosecution policy?

From a legal point of you what would we say? If you can provide me with this today I will look at and add to the Media

Thanks

Thanks Andy

Rod, can you make sure Chis is up to date on all of this in advance of the working group. I do not
want him to hear an update on these cases at the same time as the WG, especially if there might be
any suggestion that there is a delay in notification as both the legal and security teams are in his
area,

Best wishes

Security are drafting their "no further action” letters as we speak (I've been chasing them for two days but only just got
hold of someone). I should have them within the next hour. I'll then email the letters in respect of the "Rees" case to
Ron so he can provide his CQ questions before we send them out.

Just to recap on the 5 criminal cases:

1, Rees — We have confirmed to WG that no further action is to be taken. Letters to be sent to Rees asap

2. Abbas — no further action to be taken — I will update the WG on Thursday about this.

3. Kasaby —PF in Scotland have indicated that no action to be taken. I will update Tony and then liaise with
Jarnail / the PF to write to Kasasby. We will then update the WG.

4. King - To be prosecuted. Criminal case summary with Tony.

5. Kaur — To be prosecuted. Criminal case summary with Tony.

Kind regards
Andy

I think its more than copy us in, I think we need to clear it, it needs ti go special delivery and also
the letter re the mediation scheme needs to go very shortly after.

Thave lost track of the Rees case, has that letter gone now?

And Ialso see we have a ‘Scottish’ case. I don't know if that was one of the five?

Could someone please update me to assure me that we will be able to tell the WG that the
notifications have been sent about not proceeding and we have informed them tat they are now in
the scheme.

Bringing Sophie back in the loop as these cases may become press stories.

Best wishes
