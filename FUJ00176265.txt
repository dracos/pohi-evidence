1.0 Introduction

The Horizon system generates significant amounts of data that is of interest to Post Office Ltd
Internal Audit and other groups.

Subject to certain constraints the audit data must be made available to POLIA or other
authorised groups within time scales established in the Audit Data Retrieval Requirements
(CSR+) [3] and the Network Banking Internal Audit Requirements [10].

This document establishes the process for requesting audit data extractions and subsequent
activities undertaken to locate, retrieve, extract & filter and prepare for despatch on behalf of
authorised requesters.

2.0 Scope

Should future releases of Horizon bring about changes to the way that data is extracted this
process will be updated to reflect those changes.

This process applies to ALL audit data extraction requests in respect of:
1. PSS ARQs

2. Other requests from POLIA

3. Internal Requests

Internal requests for audit data extraction will also be subject to this process. In these cases
the use of an Audit Record Query (ARQ) form is optional but a Peak must be raised to the
data extraction stack.

3.0 Terminology

Within this process certain terms are used which have specific meaning within the Horizon
Audit Solution. They are:

Gatherer :

Sealer :

Hoarder :

Retriever :

Extractor :

Centera :

The module responsible for collecting the audit files from the hosts, agents,
correspondence servers and interface mechanisms. This module is also
responsible for the application of the audit file naming policy.

The module responsible for calculating the checksum seal of each audit data file
before it is written to audit archive. This value is recalculated after data is
extracted by the Retriever and compared to the original value when first sealed.
Used to ensure data integrity during storage on audit archive.

The module responsible Pre-Bi3 for writing audit data files onto DLT at pre-
defined intervals. From Bi3 sealer writes audit data to Centera cubes.

The module responsible for moving audit data from the buffers where it is
placed when retrieved by Centera .

The Client/Server system responsible for retrieving data from Centera and
managing Audit Data Extractions.

4.0 Audit Data Integrity

The integrity of audit data must be guaranteed at all times from its origination, storage and
retrieval to subsequent despatch to the requester. Controls have been established to provide
assurances to Post Office Internal Audit that this integrity is maintained.

During audit data extractions the following controls apply:

a Extractions can only be made through the Audit Workstations, which exist at Feltham,
Bracknell and the 2 Data Centres. These are all subject to rigorous physical security
controls appropriate to that location. Specifically, the Feltham AWs — where most
extractions will take place — are located in secure rooms subject to proximity pass access
within a secured Fujitsu Services site.

a Logical access to the AWs and their functionality is controlled by dedicated Logins,
password control and utilises the NT and Post Office Account security features defined in
the overall Horizon security policy.

a All extractions are logged on the Audit System and supported by documented ARQs,
authorised by nominated persons within POLIA. This log can be scrutinised on the AWs.

a Extractions will only be undertaken by individuals previously notified to POLIA. Currently
this is limited to Post Office Account Audit and Post Office Account CS Security
Prosecution Support personnel. Any additions will be notified to POLIA.

a Agreement has been reached with POLIA regarding their rights to witness extractions
without warning or to request repeat extractions that they can witness.

a Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to audit archive
and re-calculated when the files are retrieved.

Fujitsu Services AUDIT DATA EXTRACTION PROCESS Ref: TA/PRO/004
Version: 2.1

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 15/09/04

5.0 Overview
The process assumes that audit data has been Gathered, Sealed and written to audit archive.
The five main types of files are :

a. TMS Journals from the Correspondence Servers.

b. Flattened Oracle tables output from regular OBCS database purging cycles.
c. Transaction files to and from PO systems

d. AP Client Files

e. Tivoli Event files

All file types are referenced in TD/ION/011.

The process is invoked through the receipt of an ARQ into Post Office Account CS Security
PSS. Expressed in business terms, the ARQ must be interpreted into its component Audit
Points and Sub-points. This then enables specific files to be identified and retrieved by the
Audit Retriever, formatted as appropriate and then further Extracted against the ARQ criteria.
Depending on the extraction method the data can be extracted to standard MSExcel 97 before
being placed onto CD-W. The CD is then checked for despatch to the ARQ originator.

The following paragraphs present an overview of each step in the extraction process and are
ordered to reflect the actual processing of a Audit Record Qu ery (ARQ) by Post Office
Account CS Security PSS.

5.1 Audit Record Query

All POLIA requests for audit data must be made via the Audit Record Query form. This will
contain a description, in business terms, of the times, outlets, events, items activities that the
Auditors are interested in. This request has to be interpreted by Post Office Account CS
Security PSS and mapped onto the Audit Points and Files described later in this document.

Internal requests (e.g. from Post Office Account investigations personnel) will typically be in
the form of a Peak on the ‘Dataextraction’ stack for CS Security.

5.2. Marking Files and Tapes
Based on the above interpretation of the ARQ, as many files of audit data that are needed to
satisfy the request are ‘marked’ for retrieval.

5.3. Audit Track Retriever

Polls the user area buffers and makes them available to sealer for seal verification

Version: 2.1
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 15/09/04
Audit Data Check Seal

To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the audit archive the checksum seal for the
file is re-calculated by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the original value calculated
when the file was originally written to the audit archive. The result is maintained in a Check
Seal Table.

5.4 Audit Trail Extractor

This is a facility that uses various tools to extract or reform the retrieved audit data in
accordance with the ARQ. It also places the information onto a CD-W, or other suitable
media, for despatch to the ARQ originator.

Version: 2.1

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 15/09/04

6.0 Retrieving & Extracting Audit Data
6.1 Receiving the ARQ

a) POLIA requests for audit data extractions must come to Post Office Account CS Security
PSS in the form of an Audit Record Query. An example of this form can be found at Annex A.
The ARQ may be mailed, faxed or e-mailed to Post Office Account CS Security PSS.

ARQs will only be accepted from persons fulfilling the following role or their delegate :

POL Internal Audit. Casework Manager: Tel i-

-GRO_

Current names of persons fulfilling this role will be confirmed in writing by POLIA Internal
Audit and held locally by PSS.

If other parts of the Post Office, or other organisations, require audit data extractions they
must be channelled through POLIA to Post Office Account CS Security PSS.

Contractual limits and turnaround times for the provision of Audit Record Queries are detailed
in the document CS/SER/016.

b) Internal requests will be in the form of a Peak, allowing the requestor’s identity to be
verified. Requestors should state what media is acceptable (e.g. CD-W, email of WinZipped
file up to 500kB) The despatching of confidential data is bound by Fujitsu Services policy. For
TMS files - also referred to as “message store” or “Correspondence Server”- they should also
specify the output file format(s): text, MS-Excel or MS-Access. (See Section 8 for more
information).

POLIA and Internal requests are recorded on the PSS Database (User Guide for
Prosecution Support Database [12]). They should be logged to record the following
information: Request id (e.g. ARQ no.), the date the request was received, the FAD and date
range to search. Turnaround times are covered by contract as specified in the CCD
CS/SER/016.

6.2 Interpreting the ARQ

It is necessary to interpret the ARQ by identifying the audit points and sub points that
generated the records that are required and, through the Audit Data Catalogues [4-8], the files
produced at those audit points and sub points.

1. Login 1 HH

2. Password : *#### IR

3. Domain :PWYDCS

At this point the SecureID Authentication is invoked. See SecurID Normal Token User Guide
& am out the following procedure to authenticate yourself as an authorised user

1. Enter passcode _: <personal 6 digit PIN and 6 digit SecureID token display>

The AW will present a blank desktop with a START icon in the bottom left of the screen.

Using pull up <Programs> will reveal the extent of products available for any subsequent
extraction work, as shown in Figure 1.

Start Menu

Figure I

6.4 Preliminary Housekeeping

It is highly likely that an average ARQ will need a significant number of files to satisfy it. To
avoid the AW filestore becoming clogged with hundreds of files it is strongly recommended
that a working directory is established on the AW to hold all files relevant to a particular ARQ

1. Select <Windows_NT_Explorer> from the drop down menu.

2. Set up <New Folder> as D:\audit data\ARQ Reference No.

6.5 Targeting the Data Files
At this stage of the retrieval procedure the Audit Extractor Client is used to identify and mark
the files required for retrieval.

Once the TMS Archive files have been deposited in EXTRACTED_AT they must be ‘built’
into a pseudo Correspondence Server for R-Query to access. Further filtering is available to
restrict the number of Outlet records that are included in the re-build activity based on the
original ARQ.
Clear MessageStore — This clears the current messagestore on the audit workstation
Generate MessageStore — enter the date parameters and FAD code, as depicted below
in Figure 12 and then ‘Generate MessageStore’ to generate the message store on the
audit workstation.

Server MS Build — Used to generate a messagestore on the audit server. Only one
workstation at a time can generate a messagestore on the audit server. This shall only
be used as a last resort.

Oracle / Build Table — Allows the user to rebuild Oracle back up files in the Oracle format.

Unzipping Zipped Flat Files - It is strongly recommended that files to be unzipped are
transferred from the AS to the AW in their zipped state and unzipped on the AW. This can
produce space savings of the order of 90%.

NT Explorer is used as a tool for viewing files associated with an ARQ. As each new request
is logged on the Audit Extractor Client using ‘New ARQ’ a directory will be created on the
audit server for which the request was initiated from. Each directory takes the Audit
Extractor Client ARQ Reference i.e. POIA****. This main directory holds the sub
directories; Extracted_at, Restore_at and Retrieved_at. The main directory includes a txt file
named using the Audit Extractor Client ARQ reference. This files contains details of each
process initiated through the Audit Extractor Client. NT Explorer allows a window to view
these files and directories.

10.0 Introduction to R-Query

R-Query is an interrogation tool used to extract data from a Correspondence Server. It has
powerful SQL type features, which are used to define the extraction scenarios and the ability
to output the results to standard MS-Office utilities.

It is a vital element in the Audit Workstation tool set and requires that a Correspondence
Server exists on one of the Audit Workstations or Servers. Details on how to achieve this pre-
requisite can be found earlier in this procedure.

10.1 Invoking R-Query and Connecting to a Correspondence
Server.

The Riposte Query initial screen is invoked from the start menu.

Fun Query

The <Save and Restore> dialogue provides the opportunity to restore scenarios that have

already been scripted for further use.
SCENARIOS FOR RE-USE EXIST AT TWO LEVELS:
Those that are associated with the current Correspondence Server.

Those that have been saved to an external file or Catalogue.

Scenarios associated with the Correspondence Server exist only while that particular CS
exists. If the user believe that an extraction scenario is likely to be re-usable it’s as well to
remember that unless the scenario is saved to an external file it will not be available if a new

CS is built for another retrieval exercise.

Use these steps to re-use scenarios associated with current Correspondence Server.

Go to ‘Save and Retrieve Queries using Message Store’ window.

Select <Refresh> to list all scenarios associated with the current Correspondence Server.

Highlight the required scenario and select <Retrieve>.

10.3 Running the Query

Normally the user would not actually execute the retrieval scenario until such time as they had
built the query statement (the Where tab), selected the fields (Select Cols) and chosen the
output medium (Output Options). However, at any time in this sequence they can run the
query statement by selecting <Run Query> using the button on the “Save and Restore” tab.

Enter the required Post Office (FAD) code into the <Group ID:> field if it is not shown.

Once this has been done an intermediate screen will be displayed, allowing the file format to be
confirmed — select the <Excel> or <Access> buttons or the “text” icon, as appropriate to
commence loading the package and complete the data transfer. This will also allow the data
format to be checked on-screen.

Note: In the case of very large Correspondence Server files spanning a number of days, an
error may be generated on trying to save an Excel file. This will be because the maximum
number of rows (records) has been exceeded. Should this occur, the range of dates should be
covered, say one or two days at a time, and a number of output files generated.

In rare cases it will theoretically be possible to produce a text output file that is too big to be
read by Wordpad. Should this occur, a possible response is to produce output files for a
smaller range of dates, or to initially create data as an Excel working file which can be ‘Save
As’ “Text, OS/2 or MS-DOS”.

It is good practice to check that all output files can be opened before they are copied to floppy
disk or CD-W for onward transmission.

11.0 Data Retrieval — Missing Day

Tf while retrieving data for an ARQ there is no data retrieved for a day, or a sequence of days (but not
all days) duplicate retrieval of data for those missing days from the other server to ensure consistency.

If both servers are consistent, re-run R-Query using templateMissingDay,rft from the day before to the
day after the missing day.

The spreadsheet is sorted by ID and Number

Check that the number sequencing is contiguous from day to day - normal, automatic housekeeping
events, both during the early hours, and at the end of the normal working day, will be present.

If the numbering system is contiguous, it means that there is no sales activity records absent. If in
doubt, call Audit Support to verify.

Save the spreadsheet to the ARQ directory and name using the missing day(s) as the title.

Select Readme for missing day.frt (if not on audit station use from Janes Directory on Bootle) and
complete and save to ARQ directory.

Both should be sent to POL along with the normal ARQ data.

12.0 Data Retrieval — No Records Found

In the event that during R-Query a message of ‘No Records Found’ is presented for a series of days, it
may be that the outlet has been assigned to the incorrect cluster in Horizon. Another symptom of this
error is that only two files are brought forward when connecting to the store, and checking for gaps.

Ask him to check which cluster the outlet should be assigned to. If it is incorrect in Horizon the Audit
Support team should be advised.

Until the necessary changes are made in the system a manual selection of the cluster will be necessary.
To connect to the correct cluster follow these steps:-

1. Start a new query in Horizon

N

Specify dates required and select ‘update’, as usual

3. DO NOT enter FAD code into the “PO FAD Code’ box as usual
4. Under ‘Audit Point’ select “TMS”
5

. Under ‘Sub Point’ select correct cluster ie ‘Cluster 1B’ or ‘Cluster 1W’ depending on the
server already selected

6. Return, in the ‘FileName template’ box type:
FNOI_TMS_CLUSTERXX_X_X_*

CLUSTERXX — type the relevant cluster code ie CLUSTERIB

Third X - CLUSTERXX_X — type W or B depending on server chosen

Fourth X — CLUSTERXX_X_X - type number displayed on original ARQ request which resulted in
“No Records Found’ from ‘Filename for ARQ Ref POIA...’ ie “FNO]_TMS_CLUSTERIW_W_6 —
this number should also correspond with the third number of the FAD code.

7. Complete data extraction as usual

From here the user selects the source file from the drop down box. The source file should be
held on the D:\ under Auditdata\ARQ***. The files will appear in the top window, the user
will then drag and drop the required files to the lower window. All CD’s will be recorded as
‘Closed’ to prevent any further data being added to the CD. The CD-W shall be passed to CS
Security and checked for viruses after the data has been written to it and before sending it to
Post Office Ltd.

In order to adopt ‘best practice’ processes all data retrieval completed by Security Department staff is
to be checked by another prior to despatch. These notes contain the fundamental checks required.

A copy of the original request received from Post Office Limited and the resultant CD will be passed to
the checker. The following initial checks should be made:-

«The FAD code has been ticked as checked on the ARQ form
¢ The written details on the disk reflect the requirements of the ARQ

e The detail of the retrieval has been recorded on the ARQ form

Open the CD, the following checks should be made:-

© The transaction and event files cover the timeframe requirements of the ARQ

¢ Open the transaction spreadsheet and check the timeframes match the requirements and that the
first and last day of the request are present

¢ Check Group, at the top of the spreadsheet, and FAD number on ARQ form are the same
¢ Select sheet 2 and check the FAD number listed in column I is correct

¢ She files used cover the timeframe plus 2 days

© ‘Size of Gaps’ equals ‘None’

© Close transaction spreadsheet and open events spreadsheet

¢ Again, check FAD number and timeframe(s)

¢ Logon is present at the top of the data retrieved for the first day of the ARQ timeframe requirement
(be aware some reports are produced automatically and can be present prior to log on)

¢ Log off is present at the bottom of the data retrieved for the last day of the ARQ timeframe
requirement — if a day(s) is missing check whether day(s) falls on a Sunday or Bank holiday

¢ Duplicate audit details to those recorded on sheet 2 of the transaction spreadsheet are also held on
the events spreadsheet, select sheet 2 and perform a similar check

* Close events spreadsheet
© Retrieval data is held in both 95 and 97 formats

¢ Open Readme first file and check correct ARQ number has been entered and that personal details
and anti-virus information is correct
