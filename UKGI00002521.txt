Hi Tim,

Just wanted to check where we are on getting details of the cases that have been resolved and what kind of
settlements were reached from POL?

Thanks,
Alysa

Alysa,

I’m still chasing down a response to one of your questions but in the meantime please note:

Q: Where was the media coverage?

A: The story broke on a BBC local station in the North East but was subsequently covered on Radio 5 and Radio 4. POL
responded to the story quickly and it lasted less than a 12hr news cycle.

Q: Who originally appointed Second Sight?

A: POL originally appointed Second Sight to prepare a report on the Horizon system in 2013 and, subsequent to this,
the firm was then appointed (with the support of the Minister and MPs) by the Project Sparrow Working Group (i.e.
POL, JFSP and the independent Chair) as its forensic adviser.

I hope to have a response to your final question tomorrow.

Thanks,

Tim

Alysa,

Let me come back to you on Monday if that’s ok. It’s not an area I’m all over but between me and Richard we should
be able to get you a clear response.

Thanks,
Tim

Hi Tim and Peter,

Just to say I showed Jo the letter from Paula Vennels on the Second Sight Report. She has noted the contents and
asked where exactly the media coverage was? Was it Radio 4? She also wanted to double check, is it POL who
originally appointed Second Sight? Lastly, in terms of the cases resolved that have settled, is there any further detail
we can get on this? Understand that confidentiality means details could be limited, but I think the Minister is looking
for further details on what kind of settlements the mediation has concluded in. Grateful for an answer to the
Minister’s questions for the Tuesday 2pm box, but can see Peter is out of office so let me know if that’s an issue.

Thanks,
Alysa
