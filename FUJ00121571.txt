Colin,

I spoke to Jim Cruise today.

He tells me that there was a case management conference and POL have decided on the following :

41. To make her an offer of three months pay - this since they could give her three months notice to quit for no reason
anyway.

2. To hold circulating our reply to Coyne pending the outcome of her decision to the offer.

3. Potentially go for Mediation although she has said that she cannot pay for that route. This seems strange given that if
she forces litigation and loses she has no assets to cover her costs. Clearly she is assuming that if it gets to Court she will
win and have her costs covered.

They recognise the difficulty of providing objective evidence to counter Coyne's non-specific assertions and I get the
impression they want to avoid a showdown for that reason.

He'll keep me abreast of what's happening.
I guess there's not much more we can do at this stage other than wait and see.
Do you need to appraise Keith Baines of this and should we inform Masons?

Cheers,

Jan Holmes
