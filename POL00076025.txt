Robert,

Please find attached a couple of letters regarding the above case you are dealing with one from the SPMR to yourself
the second from the SPMR daughter to Robert Daily — 1 guess you are aware of both?

As discussed yesterday there is no need for Angela to be aware of this case but because Horizon is cited this should be
registered via the normal process — it looks like it have been raised by the Security team on a call about Horizon.

i know we discussed this case at length yesterday and if you need to discuss further please give me a call.
Thanks

John

Angela,

I referred to this branch on the Horizon call this week and it was suggested you should be made aware (letter associated).
It concerns the SPMRs father communicating with the Contract Advisor and issues regarding the provision of Horizon
information.

Robert Daily is the Investigator in this case.
