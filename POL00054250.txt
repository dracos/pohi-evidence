SRA GUILDFORD CROWN COURT TRIAL- 15TH MARC

01/03/2010 10:35
darnail,

Thanks for the information, which I've now read through.

I think I can summarise the situation as follows:

1. Ms Misera says initially identified that the sub post office was
short of cash by about £80 - £90K

2. She tried to cover this up while she repaid the loses which she
thought was due to staff theft

3. By the time of the audit in Jan 2008 she was £73K short suggesting
she had made good about £10K of the losses

4. When she went to court, she saw an article in Computer Weekly
indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the
bandwagon.

5. Note that there is no evidence to support any of the cases
referenced in the Computer Weekly articles and there is case law showing
the reliability of Horizon. (The case of Marine Drive which I think was
referred to in the Computer Weekly article.)

However I don't see how anything here changes the fact that she falsified
the accounts or that money was missing.
What I still don't understand is exactly what it is that the defence is

"lost" this money
rather than her or her staff stealing it. Therefore unless we can get a

claiming in terms of where exactly Horizon might have

POL00054250
POL00054250

clear statement as to exactly what is being looked for and when the system

allegedly made mistakes, I don't think there is anything I can do.
appreciate that it is up to the Prosecution to prove Horizon is reli.
rather than the defence to prove it isn't, but it is always difficult to

prove that there are no errors - particularly over such a long period of

time.)

(I do

Surely it is down to the Post Office investigators to get to the bottom of
exactly where there is anything in dispute. At that point I might be able

to assist with some technical knowledge to help interpret the various logs

to support such areas of dispute.

I'll leave Penny to continue the discussions she is currently having with
the Post Office investigators until there is something concrete for me to

investigate.

Regards

Gareth
