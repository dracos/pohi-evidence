Dear Neil

I in the debt recovery section of P & BA and so could only report to you TC's that have
already been issued.

However part of my duty includes the deduction from remuneration process and so I do
have a little knowledge of the office. I can confirm that a TC relating to Lottery has been
issued and settled centrally for a credit of £22,778.40. Unfortunately, this credit was eaten
into by a Lottery debit TC for £34,028.00.

The debt at the office currently stands at £16,042.67 although this is reducing monthly
due to deductions being made from remuneration. I recently had a conversation with the
Lottery Team and they have confirmed that no further TC's are due to be issued.

With reference to my recent visit to the above branch to discuss the various discrepancies
at the above branch. There were a number of points raised which I hope you can help with
some clarification/advice.

Mr Moir had been visited last year by David Round, a member of the Area Team. David,
who had been helping the branch during the early days following their appointment
advised the Subpostmaster that there were some transaction corrections coming to them
which were in their favour. Although unsure of the exact amount (he thinks around £1600)
the errors related to problems they had when processing cheques. To date, Mr Moir has
not received this. Would it be possible to find out what has happened to this refund
and update the branch?

Mr Moir has not been provided with any evidence relating to the £4000 inward remittance
error. As it was in the early days following appointment, the phone call from the
Remittance Centre to advise them that they hadn't accounted for the delivery was accepted
without question. They were apparently talked through how to enter the amount into
Horizon without the normal barcode scan. The branch has been unable to find any
remittance advice for the amount, which as far as they can tell was not an order they had
placed. I am told by the branch that there are regular mistakes in deliveries between
themselves and a nearby branch of Winlaton (394329). Mr Moir has suggested that this
may be another instance of the branches getting mixed up. If you can provide the date
and evidence to support this error it may be possible to shed some light on how such
a small branch could "lose" an amount equivalent to the remittance.

Although, I have no previous knowledge of the branch, it would appear that the branch has
been naive in accepting all the above without question and without any supporting
evidence. As things stand, they will end up paying half of their remuneration back to cover
these repayments, which would certainly effect the viability of the branch.

As far as I can see to date we have not received any documentary evidence from the spmr
stating that he is not liable for the loss of £1463.07. I therefore have two options 1. You
have one last go at recovering the money. 2. I write to the spmr and invite him to a fact
finding interview to explain why he is still refusing to repay. In you opt for 1. can you let
me know how things progress.

Thanks

Dear Neil

I have some information regarding your point No 2.

The Transaction Correction was issued in January and the Postmaster requested further
evidence. The evidence was being sent separately in the Post but evidence was sent again
22.02.2006.

The proof of delivery was clearly signed by the name of "Moir". Speaking to the duty
holder it would appear that Mr Moir accepted that he had the delivery but was going to

send in proof that this had been remmed in. We have never received this to date.

Both the Cash Centre and Chesterfield experienced difficulty in getting hold of Mr Moir
despite leaving messages.

Although the proof of delivery has been sent twice I could arrange for it to be sent again.
But if the question is to when Mr Moir remmed in the cash he will need to provide this
evidence to us.

Please let me know if you require any further information.

T've made a tentative arrangement with the son of the Subpostmaster (currently off sick) to
drop in at the branch on Wednesday afternoon, however, I thought I would come back to
you to clarify some concerns I have about this.

During the conversation with the son of the Subpostmaster, it appears that they have no
argument against the payment of the latest shortages, however, the earlier discrepancy of
@ £4000 is the one they dispute. It appears that the branch was informed of a remittance
that hadn't been accounted for, and being new to the Post Office were talked through how
to process through Horizon without scanning the advice notice. The result was a
discrepancy in the following balance.

I was told that the branch has not signed any agreement for deduction from remuneration
for repayment, which certainly used to be a requirement in the days I last got involved
with this sort of thing. The branch would like the opportunity to search for the paperwork
relating to the cash delivery and get some help in investigating what has gone wrong. At
this stage I'm not sure who would help them, as I would certainly struggle.

Does the Subpostmaster not have to agree to the repayments anymore? I was told that
Horizon doesn't give you the option to reject the error if disputed, and I haven't the up to
date knowledge to question this.

Till let you know how I get on when I visit, but if you have any thoughts or guidance on the
subject, they would be gratefully received.

Please see the attached, I think this warrants further investigation. Can you contact the
branch advise that because a debt is already be repaid this new debt will need to settled in
full immediately. If the branch is not in a position to repay I may have to consider their
contractual position.
