1 Introduction

This document defines the configuration of the live HNG-X Audit Servers from Weekend D onwards, and provides
the definitive reference from which TWS schedules and Audit gathering configurations may be built.

This document was derived from the equivalent Horizon document TD/ION/011

Until the roll out of HNG-X begins the PVCS document TD/ION/011 should be used as the source of reference for
Audit Server configuration and the Maestro scheduling of Audit jobs

During HNG-X roll-out this document will be subject to numerous changes, and may at times be out of
synchronisation with the live environment.

5 Audit File Naming Structures

5.1 Name Structure

The audit file naming structure is :-

<FNV>_<AP>_<ASP>_<Siteld>_<Info>_<Date>_<DateSubIndex>_<CV>.<ext>

The file name components are sourced as follows :-

Component Details

FNV Sourced from FNVariant of configuration file and set to
FNO1

AP Sourced from Identifier of the Audit Point being gathered in
the configuration file

ASP Sourced from Identifier of the Audit Sub Point being
gathered in the configuration file

Siteld Sourced from Siteld in the configuration file and set to W
(Wigan or IRE19) or B (Bootle or IRE11)

Info Sourced from detail held in the renaming policy for the file
being gathered. Defaults to ~ if there is renaming to the Info
component
Length is between 1 and 64 characters

Date Date in CCYYMMDD format sourced from gathered file
name, or generated by details in the renaming policy

DateSubIndex Sourced from detail held in the renaming policy for the file
being gathered, or generated by the renaming policy

cv Sourced from ContentVariant in the configuration file and
set to VO01

ext Sourced from gathered file as defined in the renaming
policy

5.3 Default Naming

Should there be any file at an Audit Sub point which cannot be processed and renamed according to its
renaming policy (as it does not conform to the agreed construct) then a default filename will be
generated.

The format is :-
<FNE>_<AP>_<ASP>_<Siteld>_<Info>_<Date>_<DateSubIndex>_<CE>.<ext>

The file name components are sourced as follows :-

Component Details
FNE Sourced from FNException of configuration file and set to
NSO1
AP Sourced from Identifier of the Audit Point being gathered in
the configuration file (maximum 6 characters)
ASP Sourced from Identifier of the Audit Sub Point being
gathered in the configuration file (maximum 32 characters)
Siteld Sourced from Siteld in the configuration file and set to W
(Wigan/IRE19) or B (Bootle/IRE11)
Info Set to ~ (tilde)
Date Date in CCYYMMDD format sourced from date gathered
DateSubIndex Time in HHMMSShh format sourced from time gathered
CE Sourced from ContentException in the configuration file and
set to VXXX
Ext Sourced from extension of gathered file

Audit Configuration

Configuration File Overview

The configuration file, which controls the operation of the Audit server, is comprised of a number of
sections:

.

General control details

Delete module control

Sealer module control

Hoarder module control (historic, the Hoarder component is now longer used in HNG-X)
Retriever module control

Scheduling Points

Gatherer configuration details

Tape Pool details (largely historic)

Audit Point details

Sub point details

The five control sections are independent of each other, but the latter five sections are interrelated as
show in the following diagram

Each of the audit point subsections of the document is structured hierarchically into

Audit Point (level 1)

Where Audit sub Points are mirrored on platforms on each Campus (Bootle/IRE11 and Wigan/IRE19)
they are only shown once with details for each campus.

6.11.2 Audit Point Details

The following details are held:

Configuration Item

Description

Audit Point Number

Numeric reference for the Audit Point within the
configuration file.

Identifier

The name of the Audit Point. Maximum length 6
characters.

TapePoollndex

The Tape Pool used by the audit point. See §6.7.

Use of Tape Pools is historic. This parameter
defines the data retention Policy for the Audit
Point:

1: 7 years
2: 18 Months
3: 7 years

CopySeal

Historic. No longer used.

6.11.3 Audit Sub Point Details

An audit sub point is the physical location where files are gathered for Audit purposes. The applications
that form the Pathway system are responsible for making files available at an Audit Sub Point for
gathering by the Audit Server.

The following details are held: -

Configuration Item

Description

Sub Point Number

Numeric reference for the Sub Point within the configuration file.

Identifier

The name of the Audit sub point. Maximum length 32 characters.

AuditPointindex

The reference number of the associated Audit Point within the Audit
Configuration file

Gathererindex

DeletionPolicy This represents the time that the audit server will delete an audit track from

the remote share from where it was gathered.
The deletion policy is expressed as: HOARD+nnnn

where HOARD represents the time at which the audit track was written to the
Audit Centera and nnnn represents minutes after the HOARD time.

e.g. HOARD+2880 would mean that an audit track can be deleted after 2
days.

Note that this parameter sets a minimum deletion time delay. In practice,
dependent upon the timing of schedules, an audit track may not be deleted for
up to 24 hours after the DeletionPolicy time expires.

RenamingPolicy The renaming policy which will be applied to all audit tracks gathered at this
subpoint. See §5.2
DelayInHours Gatherers will not gather a file immediately it appears within an audit share.

A file will not be gathered until at least ‘DelaylnHours’ hours after the files
modification time.

This is a fail safe mechanism to avoid gathering files that are still being
appended to.

Exclude Any file whose suffix (e.g. tmp) matches this parameter will not be gathered.

The purposes of this is to enable audit data sources to build up an audit track
within the audit share without any danger of an incomplete file being gathered
by the audit server. When the audit data source determines that it has
completed writing the audit track it can rename the file to change the suffix to
something other than the excluded suffix. It will then be candidate for
gathering.

TransferData Determines whether the audit server will replicate data from this subpoint to
the other audit server/Centera.

In practice all subpoints have this parameter set to yes with the exception of
Riposte data gathered from the Horizon Correspondence servers (TMS Audit
Point)

PreCompress Indicates whether data is already compressed at the originating platform.
Possible values for this are

NONE No data compression is applied at source. The audit server will
compress/decompress the data prior to writing/after retrieving from Centera.
The MDS seal check is applied to the uncompressed data.

GZIP Data is compressed at source using gzip compression. The audit
server will not compress the data again before writing to Centera. The MDS
seal calculation will be applied to the compressed data. The data will be
automatically gunzip’d (after seal checking) upon retrieval.

In practice GZIP is only used for Branch Database counter audit data.
