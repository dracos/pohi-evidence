Introduction

A key requirement in the Post Office Account solution is that of business continuity i.e.
ensuring there are operational processes and procedures in place to ensure that any
component failure has minimal effect on the service provided.

This will cover failures in the core Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) services e.g.
NBS, TPS, APS etc, support services and client services where appropriate

A principle requirement specified within schedule 21 of the Varied and Restated
Codified Agreement is the provision of contingency plans which conform to an overall
“Service Continuity Framework’.

It is the objective of this document and associated contingency plans to satisfy that
requirement and Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) and Post Office Limited have
agreed that the title of this document should be ‘Business Continuity Framework’

Specifically this document will cover the following areas.

a) Provide a baseline definition of the Business Continuity Framework and
contingency plans as specified in Schedule 21 of the Varied and Restated Codified
Agreement.

b) Provide a detailed definition of Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) deliverables
associated with business continuity and the methods of review and assurance.

C) Define the contents and format of the contingency plans.
d) Define the overall test strategy adopted for testing of the contingency plans.

@) Define the management processes for the management of Major Business
Continuity Incidents.

Scope

The scope of this document is targeted towards the Acceptance Review process
associated with the Varied and Restated Codified Agreement.

The general framework defined in this document is release-independent.

This document does not include any details in respect of the technical testing of the
recovery processes, however REF 10 does.

Definitions

Business Continuity Framework is this document, which has been generated to
satisfy the requirement for a Service Continuity Framework.

At a working level, Post Office Limited and Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account)
generally recognise the term Business Continuity as having three closely related
components:

Resilience may be defined as the steps taken to avert a loss of service or disaster or
reduce the likelihood of a disaster or loss of service.

Contingency may be defined as the interim processes and procedures adopted during
the loss of service.

Recovery may be defined as the business and technical arrangements to restore a lost
system or service and manage the process of reversion to normal processing and full
resumption of service.

4.0 Framework Overview

4.1 Introduction

The Business Continuity Framework defines the methodology agreed between Fujitsu
Services (Post Office Account) and Post Office Limited for handling all aspects of
Business Continuity.

The constituent elements of the Business Continuity Framework may be represented as

follows. Each element will be looked at in more detail below.

Version: 9.0

COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 19-Oct-2004

4.1.1 Contingency Plans
At the time of writing version 8.0 of this document there are three Continuity Plans:
The Horizon Services Business Continuity Plan
The Horizon Support Services Business Continuity Plan
Horizon System Helpdesk Business Continuity Plan

The contents of these continuity plans are specified within Schedule 21 of the Varied
and Restated Codified Agreement. All plans must be of the document type
Contingency Plan and shall contain Continuity Plan within the title. Each plan shall
have a specified owner. (Further details in section 9)

Major elements of the plans are as follows.

4.1.1.1 Service Definition

The BCF shall be defined in terms of services rather than components of infrastructure.
The definitions of the services that are a subject of the BCF are defined in this
document. This is looked at in more detail in section 5.

4.1.1.2 Risk Analysis And Service Impact

Each contingency plan will identify all potential risks in terms of likelihood and service
impact

Once an incident occurs which has a service continuity impact, there must be a
mechanism in place to assess the impact of the incident and the possible effect(s) it will
have on the end to end service. This is fairly complex and will be dependant upon time
of day and therefore will be a real-time process i.e. the impact of the service failure at
2am will be different from the impact at 8pm. However, a high-level impact statement
will be included in the relevant contingency plan.

4.1.1.3 Escalation Contacts
Each contingency plan will contain escalation routes in conformance to Cross-Domain
Business Continuity management processes.

4.1.1.4 Resilience Strategy documents
Each contingency plan will contain, where appropriate, references to the underlying
resilience strategy document and/or technical design documents.

4.1.1.5 Contingency Procedures
Each contingency plan will contain a section defining contingency actions.

From an operational perspective contingency actions are documented in a number of
places, depending upon the severity of the service element failure.

1, Within operational procedures, subordinate to REF7. Where appropriate the
contingency plan will make reference to the relevant operations manual.

Version: 9.0

COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 19-Oct-2004

2, Where appropriate, contingency actions are documented within the Action column
of the Risk Analysis (and service impact) section of each plan.

3, Where appropriate, for potential MBCIs and MBCI contingency actions are
documented in the contingency section of each plan.

4.1.2 Service Framework
Section 5 contains details of the service elements and components together with their
relationship to each of the contingency plans.

4.1.3 Business Continuity Management Process

The resolution of incidents will be dealt with through the standard Help Desk Incident
Management process.

In the event of a Major Business Continuity Incident there will be a need for controlled
and co-ordinated activity across Post Office Account and Post Office Limited. (See
section 6)

4.1.4 Test strategy and plans
The test schedule and method will be defined as a separate document (REF 3) and will
be referred to within the contingency plans. The overall high-level strategy will be
defined in this document for agreement. (See section 7)

4.1.5 Review strategy
A review strategy defines the joint review mechanism prior to acceptance and also the
review mechanism of the processes following acceptance. This is defined in a later
section for agreement. (See section 8)

4.1.6 Deliverables and Acceptance Methods

Section 10 defines the deliverables required to satisfy the Business Continuity
requirements of Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account).

Also included in that section is the method of acceptance planned for each deliverable.

5.0 Service Framework

5.1 Introduction
The core service elements and support services are show in Figure 5.2 below.

The service framework is show diagrammatically in Figure 5.1 below. During 2003 a
simplified set of three Business Continuity Plans were produced, as a significant
amount of the Horizon infrastructure is shared by numerous services and therefore was
replicated across many of the original continuity plans. The reduced set has several
advantages include easier access to the applicable information by POA Duty Managers
during incident management and improved documentation maintenance. The three
Business Continuity Plans are:

The Horizon Services Business Continuity Plan which documents the contingency
measures for the primary Horizon services

The Horizon Support Services Business Continuity Plan which documents, with the
exception of the HSH services, the contingency measures for the supporting Horizon
services

6.0 Business Continuity Management Process

An incident is an unplanned occurrence that adversely impacts upon the normal service
in some important way. The scale of the event can range from a minor fault to a major
outage e.g.:

Minor incident e.g. Horizon terminal failure affecting service at an individual outlet.
Major incident e.g. outage of key back-end system affecting service at 17,500 outlets.

The resolution of minor incidents will be dealt with through the standard Help Desk
Incident Management process.

Major Business Continuity Incidents will have a significant impact upon Post Office
Limited. In such cases there will be a need for controlled and co-ordinated activity
across supplier organisations and Post Office Limited. Consequently all Major
Business Continuity Incidents will be managed via the ‘Fujitsu Services (Post Office
Account) Customer Service Business Continuity Management’ process (REF6) and
the Post Office Limited and Fujitsu Services Business Continuity Interface Agreement
(REF 33). These documents support the immediate escalation of major incidents to a
Cross Domain Business Continuity Management Team (BCMT). The BCMT consists
of operational managers from each organisation.

7.0 Test Strategy and Plans
7.1 Requirement
Schedule 21 of the Varied and Restated Codified Agreement states the requirement as
follows
* The contingency plans shall include a testing strategy with two distinct parts
a) Initial testing before commencement of Roll-Out of Services
b) Regular testing’
7.2 Initial Testing
7.2.1 Existing Services.
Initial Business Continuity testing was conducted prior to the full operational
introduction of the Horizon Service (Core System Release) and the subsequent release
of major services, e.g. MBS, NBS and ETS services. Test reports have been produced
for this testing and are maintained in PVCS within the CS/REP/nnn documentation
work-set
7.2.2 New Services
Where services are introduced as part of a new release the Test Plan (REF3) will be
revised to include the Business Continuity testing of those services and define when the
initial testing will be conducted.
The level and schedule of testing is dependent upon operational constraints and is
accomplished by a mix of operational tests and procedural walk-through. Where
involvement is required from Post Office Limited the test schedule will be agreed in
advance.
In addition customer-initiated test activity may be included, with Post Office Account
agreement, within the Business Continuity Test Plan (REF3).
7.3 Ongoing testing
For ongoing testing, an overall test strategy will be produced defining for each service:
a) name of service
b) ownership of testing plan
C) type of testing i.e. procedural walk-through or operational test
d) frequency of testing and scheduled dates
€) test objectives, conditions, script and expected results

8.0 Review Strategy

A Business Continuity Steering Group has been established between Post Office
Limited and Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account). This group reviews the progress
of each release against the Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) delivery and
acceptance plans. It also facilitates the co-ordination of joint development review and
assurance activities where necessary. This forum also provides an objective feed into
the release authorisation process for new releases.

This team, or subset of the team, reviews all aspects of business continuity on an
ongoing basis, during Live Trials and beyond. The remit of the team is to continually
look at ways of improving cross-domain business continuity processes.

9.0 Contingency Plans

Throughout section 9, the use of //alics denotes the actual words in Schedule 21 of the
Varied and Restated Codified Agreement.

‘The Business Continuity Plans shall be based on impact and_ risk
assessments and agreed by Fujitsu Services and Post Office .....”

9.1 Ownership of Plans

“Ownership of all contingency actions shall be identified in the Business Continuity
Plans.’

Each contingency Plan will clearly state the owner of the plan who is responsible for
the definition, maintenance, testing and review of the plan.

In addition to this, the Fujitsu Services (POA) Business Continuity Manager will have
overall responsibility for the development, co-ordination and integration where
appropriate of all Contingency Plans and providing Post Office Limited with a single
point of contact.

9.2 Plan Activation

‘The Business Continuity Plans shall include activation procedures and time periods
within which the contingency measures shall be activated.’

Where appropriate Contingency Plans will contain a risk and impact assessment for
both the core post office day (08:00 to 20:00) and the non-core post office day (20:00
to 08:00). (See 9.3). For services where the impact of the service element failure is
common throughout the day, a single risk and impact assessment will be documented.

Alternatively, a single risk statement may be documented throughout the day in the
risk table. The Critical Time Factors (CTF) here shall be determined by the criticality
of the service activity. I.e. for on-line service, e.g. NBS and DCS the CTF is identified
against Post Office Core Day processing, whilst for file transfers, e.g. APS and TPS
the CTF is identified against Post Office Non-Core Day processing. The risk
assessment identifies the critical time periods for activation of contingency measures
and identifies the associated contingency actions.

9.3 Impact and Risk Assessment

“The Business Continuity Plans shall be based on impact and risk assessments by
Fujitsu Services and Post Office...’

Contained within each service are a number of critical components, the failure of which
would cause a potential service disruption. Consideration shall also be given to the
impact arising from the loss of building or staff. Each of these critical components and
the associated failure scenarios will be identified and documented within a risk and
impact matrix within the Contingency Plan. This matrix is used as a tool to present ina
tabular form all risks identified with a service together with the impact of that risk

occurring, the time after which that impact becomes critical, and the contingency
actions to be taken.

Associated with each of the above elements are impact statements, which will define
the likely business impacts of failure of the critical components. To aid in the definition
of these, each Contingency Plan, where appropriate, will contain a schematic defining
the operational day for that particular service. SLA liabilities will be used as an aid in
determining business impact. Where the impact triggers either a Potential MBCI or an
MBCI, the appropriate action will be identified from within the matrix.

Associated with the impact statement will be a reference to the specific recovery and
contingency procedures required.

Business impact assessment will be reviewed jointly with Post Office Limited and will
be subject to ongoing review.

The combination of risk and impact will also determine the level of ongoing testing
that will form part of the testing strategy.

Other Requirements
‘The contingency plan shall include, without limitation, the following
a) Prevention measures
b) Preparedness measures
C) Contingency measures
d) Recovery of normal service
e) Contacts list’

In addition to the above the plans shall include details of the individual services,
references to the relevant operations manual and references to the underlying resilience
strategy document and/or technical design documents, where appropriate.

Preventative Measures

Preventative measures are defined as those measures that are in place to prevent
service continuity failures in the first place. There are two aspects that are considered.

9.4.1.1 Technical Design

A key element of the design of the service is the elimination of single points of failure
and the ability to Fail-over to a replicated operational facility and/or environment and
to recover the service in a timely manner.

This capability is documented in a number of technical design documents, which in
turn are referenced within the relevant Contingency Plans.

9.4.1.2 Security

Another preventative measure is the denial of access to the service to anyone who may
wish to deliberately cause disruption. Although not mentioned specifically within

Contingency Plans, this requirement is met through general conformance to Access
Control Policy (REF13) and the Security Functional Specification (REF 11).

9.4.2 Preparedness Measures
Preparedness measures are implemented in a number of ways:

a) The provision of risk and impact assessments, along with references to
appropriate recovery and contingency procedures will allow appropriate
actions to be carried out in a pre-prepared manner.

b) Initial technical testing and the operational testing of Contingency Plans
will ensure all activation of the Plans will have been carefully rehearsed.

c) Joint process and procedure walk-through will, as above, ensure all Cross-
Domain (multi-party) Business Continuity processes are tested thoroughly.

9.4.3, Contingency Measures

Contingency measures may be defined as the actions to be performed in the event of a
service break to enable business impact to be minimised during the service outage prior
to recovery being completed.

Contingency measures will include the recognition, activation, incident management
and initiation of recovery procedures. These will be documented within the
contingency plan and also as references to supporting documentation

An example of contingency measures is failing over the host server in the event of the
prime server experiencing a failure.

9.4.4 Recovery of Normal Service

These procedures will be mainly of a technical operational nature and will mainly refer
to technical procedures defined within the Fujitsu Services (Core Services) Operational
Procedures Manual REF7. There may be references to other activities that may impact
across service boundaries. Where appropriate these will be referenced within the plan.

9.4.5 Contact List

Each contingency plan will document the contacts for initial contact and technical
liaison where appropriate, together with details of escalation contacts. This will be in
accordance with the Business Continuity Management process.

10.0 Deliverables and Acceptance Methods

10.1

Introduction

This section defines the deliverables required to satisfy the Business Continuity
requirements of Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account).

Also included within this section is the method of acceptance planned for each
deliverable.

Methodologies used in the acceptance process include those identified below:

10.1.1 Joint Review

Joint review is by circulation of, discussion about and agreement upon the structure
and content of a document by Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) and Post Office
Limited.

10.1.2 Document Inspection

Formal inspection of a paper copy, by Post Office Limited, of a commercially sensitive
(i.e. technical design) or Service Provider (i.e. Fujitsu Services Core Services)
operational document, by the appropriate reviewing authorities, whilst under
supervision by the document owner. No paper or electronic copies must be taken.
Objective of this process is to verify the existence of the document; no approval rights
are associated with this activity.

Inspection to take place at the premises of the document owner.

10.1.3. Procedural Walkthrough

A paper based technique whereby a scenario is selected and the actions and procedures
of those Service Delivery Units (SDU) impacted followed through to ensure that both
individual service delivery unit procedures, and cross boundary SDU procedures, are
both complete and fully integrated. Where appropriate, i.e. affecting Post Office
Limited services, Post Office Limited will be invited to procedural walkthroughs.

10.1.4 Operational Test

An exercise using live operational service components, or where more appropriate and
agreed by Post Office Limited a test environment, whereby a scenario is selected and
the actions and procedures of those Service Delivery Units (SDU) impacted are
followed through. This is to ensure that both individual service delivery unit
procedures, and cross boundary SDU procedures are both complete and fully
integrated, and that the desired outcome on the operational service components is
achieved. This is then followed by the total regression of any changes made to the live
service components.

An example of live operational functionality testing was the Campus Fail-over test that
was conducted during CSR Live Trial. An example of a business continuity
