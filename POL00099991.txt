APPENDIX A

Following the completion of CTP at March 2015, it is envisaged that c50% of the remaining 292 Crown branches will still be loss making. The main reasons
for this are:-

e High staffing levels in relation to income — a result of smaller branches that require minimum staffing levels
e High property costs in relation to income — a result of high lease costs, either driven by size or location of branch
* Combination of the high staffing levels and high property costs
The average cost to income ratios for the branches that are anticipated to be profitable are:-
* 0.78 for staff cost to income (£0.78 of staff costs for every £1.00 of transactional income)
e 0.23 for property cost to income (£0.23 of property costs for every £1.00 of transactional income)
Note: The net position of non-transactional income and other business wide costs is positive, hence profitable branches.
Using these ratios as a benchmark, the branches that are expected to be loss making fall into the following categories:-
e 20% due to high staffing levels
e 6% due to high property costs
* 74% due to a combination of both

A branch by branch review of each loss making branch is planned for Q4, to establish the best route to profitability post March 2015 (or earlier). The review
will follow the current VR exercise that will provide a more accurate view of the staffing levels in each branch.
