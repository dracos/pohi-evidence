Hi Paula,

Please find attached a copy of the mediation pack that we are launching on Tuesday 27" August. This is the final version
(after many iterations) agreed with JFSA, Second Sight and us. I'm just awaiting confirmation on the final Comms plan to
support this launch and will then send you this also.

Please let me know if you have any queries.

Thanks,
Angela
