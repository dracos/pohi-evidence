THE GENERAL SECRETARY commented that for the good of the
Corporation Post Office Counters had been bailing out Royal Mail for years.
Now the Counters Business, because of Scottish Power, PayPoint and Royal
Mail, needed bailing out. He suggested the Federation approached the
Corporate Board direct.

MR. BURFORD wished to know what, if anything, had gone wrong regarding
Scottish Power. He had received complaints about lack of consultation,
particularly from Post Office personnel who were equally concerned at the
loss of business.

MRS. KENDALL forecast problems arising from the direct approach by
Scottish Power to Sub-Postmasters to undertake the work on their private
side.

MR. BURROWS expressed concern as to how Sub-Postmasters could be

expected to hold the line if the multiples undertook the work. It was important iq
to hold a strong line regarding the multiples. In the future the Federation

would have to be more pro-active and was intrigued that information had not

been received from members.

per hour to which Mr. Butlin had referred the Region and was awaiting a
response.

8(b) PO STORES - PCNWo04

Nothing to report.

8(c) COUNTER AUTOMATION - BA/POCL - PC NW 06 01

THE GENERAL SECRETARY reported arrangements were being made for
him to visit the South Wales and South West Region to view the Horizon
platform.

A number of reviews were taking place.

ICL had considered whether to continue the Pathway business as it would be

5 years before they would make any money and the contract was for 8 years.

Horizon was 12 months behind the original date. In addition there was the

possibility of clients being lost to PayPoint. A meeting had taken place (
between John Roberts, John Bennett, David Brooke, Chairman of ICL and the

financial representative from Japan, who had agreed to proceed with the

Horizon programme.

Girobank was being kept informed by the Federation and was continually
reviewing its position with the Post Office.

The platform for CAPS was a long way behind schedule.

A review was being conducted by the Counters Business of the PDA. The
intention was to shrink the PDA which had grown to 130 personnel.

It was suggested an upbeat message be circulated to members. As a result

of a meeting held on 15th August 1997, it had been agreed to publish a

monthly article in the journal to be organised by Alison Orsmond.

Unfortunately no articles had. been received but arrangements had been ¢
made for the Editor to interview Paul Rich.

The difficulties regarding the implementation of the Horizon programme
would be raised at the meeting with the CEC on 6th October 1997.

{It was pointed out the Horizon platform was not capable of processing APT
transactions.

8(d) COUNTER AUTOMATION - APT/BAR-CODING - PC NW 06 02
Concern was expressed that not all Sub-Postmasters had APT machines and

could not, therefore, consider the PayPoint threat. The CEC meeting would
place great emphasis on this aspect.

97/35 Free relocation of security equipment when

Sub-Postmasters improve office I
It was pointed out that if the Post Office did not provide free relocation of
security equipment, they were, in fact, in breach of the contract.

Bearing in mind the security budget was reduced by 10% in the current year,
it was suggested the subject be referred to both the Security Division and the
Network Forum meetings.

contracted the work. Cases were known of Sub-Postmasters who had

Romec. ‘
