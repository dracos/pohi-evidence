All

One of my Board actions was to review the lines on prosecutions policy.
The Board agreed not to take a proactive press approach but asked for the reactive lines to be redrawn.

I need to get back to the Board today on this (sorry) so your input and comments welcome ASAP. Rodric, I have tried to address the
points you raised on Wednesday.

Could we also get this version assessed by external lawyers as you, Rodric, suggested we should?
