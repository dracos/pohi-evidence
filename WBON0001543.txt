Dear Sirs

The Post Office Group Litigation
Further Supplemental Report of Dr Robert Worden

In the last few days, Dr Worden has informed us that he has formed the view that the Court may well be
assisted by a more focussed analysis of the Peaks, OCPs, OCRs and MSCs in issue in this case bearing
on the Horizon Issues, principally Issues 1, 12 and 13. His work is not complete, but we understand it
has reached a stage at which he believes it would be sensible to share the relevant documents with Mr
Coyne to ensure that he has his own opportunity to analyse them.

We understand that Dr Worden wishes to produce a very short supplemental report summarising his
views on these documents and he will be contacting Mr Coyne in that regard shortly.

Please note that this came as some surprise to us and we wish to make it clear that neither our client nor
its legal team requested this further work, the necessity for which we have challenged with Dr Worden,
but which Dr Worden decided to undertake pursuant to his understanding of his duty to the Court.

Yours faithfully
