lam not sure there is anything we should do before the meeting but I do think we should consider how we continue to
engage with James going forward and not leave it solely to 2nd Sight

Thanks

The gap between what they have said to you and what JA appears to have heard from them is very
striking. We need to think if there is anything more we should/could do about this before the meeting
other than write a very good letter.

We will need to pick this up at tomorrow's meeting as although Susan and I discussed the suggested

approach of a few in depth cases which could be finished more quickly, they wanted to think about
this as they are anxious to keep Bates and JFSA onside.

They do not think any of the MP cases are strong enough to be the 2 or 3 picked and this may cause an
issue as well.

Thanks

Thanks Alwen. It is very helpful to know what is in hand.

What you have heard leaves me mystified as to why JA was saying what he said to me
today but on ther hand, adjectives like “plausible” are easily misinterpreted.

As I said to you, JA intends to talk to SS before Monday's meeting and they will
therefore have an opportunity to say what they are doing/thinking very clearly to him
before the meeting which should be helpful if they use that opportunity well.

The only point you didn't cover was the one about giving the MPs a date by which we
could meet them which is, of course, tied up with how the enquiry is concluded. What is
happening about that please?

See you tomorrow.

Alice
An update on what has happened today.

* Susan and I had a meeting with Ron and lan from 2" Sight this afternoon and
they are coming in to meet Paula tomorrow at 15.00(I have offered to Paula
that I could attend with her, but that will mean someone else minuting the ARC
—Ican sort that tomorrow)

e At the meeting this afternoon 2" Sight were surprised that James now felt
there was harder evidence against the system. They used the phrases; no
evidence of widespread systemic failure; the number of cases we are seeing is
small; the pattern aligns with the themes which are already in the public
domain.

@ They assured Susan and I that they intend to make it very clear on Monday that
they have been ‘consolidating and distilling allegations and that the Post Office
have not had the opportunity to respond’

e Some of the evidence is plausible but is as yet untested.

e They are nervous about Monday, especially as it now emerges that Shoosmiths
are attending the meeting. They know that loose language will be very
unhelpful, and realise that they may end up in the press, which will not help the
investigation.

@ — Simon is pulling together the facts for your letter to James and I have discussed
with Mark , Paula also suggests that Martin Edwards would be a good person to

input. So we will pull this together tomorrow.

Hope that is helpful.
