The government will pay the reasonable legal costs of individuals applying for
financial redress under the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS).

This framework sets out the costs we will pay depending on the type of
application.

We have calculated these costs based on existing redress schemes and after
discussions with a range of legal firms who have represented postmasters
applying to those schemes. All costs in this framework exclude VAT.

If you are an HCRS applicant, we strongly advise that you check that a solicitor
is happy to operate within the terms of the costs framework before instructing
them. If you hire a solicitor who does not commit to work within our costs
framework, you may receive less financial redress due to legal costs.

The firms listed in Annex A have already agreed to work within the terms of this
costs framework. This means they have also committed not to make any
deductions from the financial redress settlement you will receive. Other firms
wishing to make this commitment and have their names added may do so by
sending their details to horizonconvictionsredress! i

Counsel.

If an applicant decides to request a detailed assessment and the final
settlement is less than £600,000 (less than if they had been advised to take the
fixed sum settlement), the claimable legal costs of the appointed solicitor will
be:

a maximum of £30,000

plus costs for any expert reports commissioned or costs related to the
annulment of bankruptcy within the maximums set out in the framework

above under bands 2 and 4

If the solicitor applies for reimbursement of costs over £100,000, we are
committed to reviewing and settling these additional costs as quickly as
possible. In the event of dispute between DBT and the relevant solicitor, the
dispute will be referred to the independent panel set up as part of DBT’s
Alternative Dispute Resolution process under the HCRS.

Commissioning experts
RLIT0000362
RLITO000362

If the costs of expert reports are not higher than maximum amount stated in the
framework, the solicitor can commission the first medical report and forensic
accountancy report without needing prior approval from us.

If you or your solicitor would like to commission further expert advice, your

solicitor must seek prior approval from us before incurring these additional
costs. See annex B for the process for support of costs for expert evidence.

Fees for consulting counsel

We are still discussing whether the solicitor will be able to claim for fees for
consulting counsel in bands 3 and 4. We'll update this page when we've
reached a decision.

Timing of payment

For Band 1, the applicable legal costs will be paid to your solicitor within 14
days of you receiving your financial redress.

For Bands 2 to 5, the costs will be paid to the solicitor in 4 instalments, each
triggered by the following:

Trigger event Instalment payments per
case
Eligibility confirmed and at same time as £10,000

applicant paid preliminary payment

DBT receives confirmation of decision that £10,000
applicant is taking the fully assessed route

Receipt by DBT of complete claim form £10,000

Receipt by DBT of applicant's agreement to Top up to agreed band level in
award line with framework above

At the end of each month, each solicitor should submit a schedule setting out:

e the additional claimable costs for that month
¢ all relevant invoices for that month
RLIT0000362
RLITO000362

We will aim to pay solicitors these costs within 28 days of receiving the

schedules.

For an expert or counsel, we will pay the disbursement fee or fee note within 28
days of receiving the invoice. This payment will include any applicable VAT.
