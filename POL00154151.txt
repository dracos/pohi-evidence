Dear all,

We have a PLSG meeting on Wednesday 24 May @15:00pm in Tonbridge (1.11). Ahead of that meeting please find
attached:

1. The Agenda

2. Decision Paper: Branch Technology Programme (BTP) —I support the recommendations. How will this be
taken forward?

3. Decision Paper: Counterclaims — I support the recommendation to bring a generic counterclaim for shortfalls
(whether or not the postmaster is still serving) as this is consistent with our BAU practice and we can consider
at a later date the cost/benefit analysis in respect of any particular postmaster. I am not supportive of claims
for loss of profit.

4. Decision Paper: Horizon Data Hold I support the recommendation to continue to hod the data. However we
should know the cost of this and we should include it in our discussion with Freeths regarding security for
costs.

5. Defence Action Plan (to be covered off as part of the legal update) —timetable noted

6. Paper to support the discussion of agenda item 3 (a review of our comms approach)— I am supportive

7. Open actions list as at 19 May 2017 — n/a

8. The more detailed background on the BTP, referenced in the BTP Decision Paper -Noted

Please let me know if you are intending to dial in.

Many thanks

Mark
