Subject: [Commission] Reappointment of the Advisory Board and call with Kevan Jones

Good afternoon all,

SoS mentioned in the pre-brief yesterday that he is keen to reappoint the Advisory
Board and keen to meet with Kevan Jones. @Rob BRIGHTWELL (DBT) and @Elena
MICHAEL (DBT) can you please lead on providing (1) a sub which proposes
reappointment, and sets out the concerns (if any), and; (2) a short briefing for the
meeting with KJ? SoS and SpAds are keen to have this all done before King’s
Speech next Thursday, which is the reason for the deadline: Can we please have
both asap, latest by Friday 1100am?

SoS is also keen to meet with Mr Alan Bates. I have had a brief conversation with
Carl, and his view is that the Advisory Board should be lined up by the time of
speaking to Mr Bates. Therefore the briefing for this can come later, with the deadline
being COP Wednesday next week.

Warmest,
Jason
