Subject: I FW: Duplicatation of Transaction Records in ARQ Returns
JP/Tom

Just to confirm our conversation this morning.

After explaining in detail the issues and actions we have taken as a result of identifying duplicate transaction records it
was JP’s view that we had taken the correct action.

In the event that POL press for a witness statement covering the transaction records supplied for Kirkoswald (which
have since been identified as containing duplicate records), and we do not re-present the records using the
workaround, then we should include in the statement that the transaction records, although provided in good faith, it
has since been identified that some records have been duplicated because .....

Similarly, should West Byfleet and/or Porters Avenue already have been presented and we are not asked to re-create
the records using either the workaround or deployed fix we should provide a Further To Statement to POL in the same
vein.

I have put a call in to both Jane and Mark this morning and await a return call. I still await confirmation from POL
which transaction records have actually been presented at Court.

Kind regards
Penny

Subject: Duplicatation of Transaction Records in ARQ Returns

Sue/Mark/Jane
We have identified that a number of recent ARQ returns contain duplicated transaction records.

With Horizon counters, the mechanism by which Data is audited has always worked on the principle that it is
acceptable to audit the same data more than once — in particular if in doubt as to whether or not it has been previously
audited successfully.

The Mechanism used on Horizon to retrieve the data took this into account and only presented one instance of such
duplicate data in the ARQ extracts.

However it has recently been noticed that the HNG-X retrieval mechanism does not remove such duplicates and a
quick scan of the ARQs provided to Post Office Ltd since the change to the new system indicates that about 35% of
the ARQs might contain some duplicate data. A Peak has been raised to enhance the extraction toolset and remove
such duplicate data in the future. However until the fix is developed, tested and deployed, there is a possibility that
data is duplicated.

The reliable way to identify a duplicate transaction is to use the <Num> attribute that is used to generate the unique
sequence numbers. This attribute is not currently included in the Excel version of ARQ data that has been passed to
Post Office Ltd in the past. This will be included in all future ARQs until the problem is fixed. A workaround, using the
<NUM> attribute is suggested, and a detailed process is attached.

Note that we have identified a scenario with Postal Services transactions where multiple, identical mails items are
accepted (ie the Quantity button is set to greater than 1), but Postage Labels are printed for each individual item. This
results in separate transactions being generated for each item, which are identical in the ARQ extracts (there is
another minor difference in the raw data apart from the <Num> attribute, but this different attribute is not currently
included in the ARQ extract).

I've put together a spreadsheet detailing affected ARQs, which is also attached.

Mark/Jane I've tried to call you both this morning but I understand you are both tied up. Please call and we can
discuss.

Kind regards
