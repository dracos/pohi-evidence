f Company Secretary’s Office

29" June 1999

To: The Directors, ICL PLC

From: TK Todd

Re: Capital Injection

In the paper I sent you with my memo of 21" May concerning the negotiations on
Pathway, we mentioned that Fujitsu had undertaken to make an injection of new
capital into ICL PLC to restore consolidated net worth as defined by the banking
covenants, to £225m, by 30" June.

The amount of the capital injection needed has been established at £131.7m and,
after discussion, it is proposed that the injection should take place by issue of new
ordinary shares at a price of £0.50p per share.

More detail and the necessary formalities are set out in the attached resolutions.
May I ask that if you approve, you kindly sign these and fax the signature page
back to Rod Scott (fax no:!

A paper from John Bennett is attached reporting progress on the Pathway Project
following the Government’s decision to cancel the benefit payment card services
and go ahead with ICL Pathway on the new basis, and the ICL decision to take a
provision of £180m in the 1998/9 accounts.

Thank you
p-p. Keith Todd

ICL PLC

Written Resolution of all the Directors of the Company pursuant to Article 97(A) of
the Articles of Association of the Company.

The Board note that

1.

Following the creation of a provision of £180m in the Company’s accounts,
arising out of the ICL Pathway Private Finance Initiative contract with Post
Office Counters Limited and the Department of Social Security it was proposed
that the Company’s major shareholder, Fujitsu Limited would subscribe for
new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (the “capital injection”) in
order to restore the company’s consolidated net worth (as defined in the
banking covenants) to £225m.

The capital injection would total £131.7m and the new Ordinary shares would
be allotted to Fujitsu Limited, it was proposed, on 30" June 1999.

In order to make the capital injection it would be necessary to formally increase
both the authorised and the issued share capital of the Company and it was
proposed that 150,688,800 unclassified shares at present part of the authorised
capital be redesignated as ordinary shares for issue as part of the capital
injection. The Company’s other shareholder, Fujitsu International Finance
Nederland B.V. has a right to be offered an appropriate proportion of the new
shares but it was proposed to disapply this right of pre-emption in favour of
Fujitsu Limited’s subscription for all the new shares.

The most recent valuation of the Company’s shares by the UK Inland Revenue
(for the purposes of the grant of share options to employees) was £0.50p per
share. Since that valuation, the Company had announced (inter alia) the
following:

> the ICL Pathway related provision of £180m and a profitable
restructured contract of approximately £1bn revenue over the six years
to March 2005.

> for the 12 months to March 1999, an increase in revenue including
growth of 16% on 1998 in revenue from strategic customers, an increase
in operating profit on ongoing operations before exceptional charges of
19%, improved operating margin on ongoing operations and an
increased forward order book totalling £4.0bn.

Having regard to these and other factors, the Board were advised the relevant
ICL executives believed the value of shares in ICL was not materially different
from £0.50p and consequently it was proposed that the capital injection take
place at a price of £0.50p per new ordinary share.

To achieve the capital injection action is required by the Board and (on the
recommendation of the Board) by the Company’s shareholders in accordance
with the resolutions below and the Board hereby

Board Report 28" June 1999

ICL PATHWAY UPDATE

1. INTRODUCTION

This paper sets out the current status of the ICL Pathway project.

2. HMG DECISION OF 24.5.99

A legally binding Agreement was signed between ICL and POCL on
24.5.99. The essential features follow the proposals made by ICL on
19.5.99 and are:

i.

iii.

iv.

vi.

vii.

Thb/99jun/324

A Letter Agreement has been signed which modifies the previously
drawn up Heads of Agreement between ICL and POCL. These two
documents then take precedent over the Related Agreements (the
original May 1996 contract).

This Letter Agreement will be replaced by a Codified Agreement
targeted to be completed by ICL and POCL by 16.7.99. This
comprehensive document will become the new POCL Agreement.

If by 16.7.99 material issues remain unresolved, then POCL have the
right to terminate the contract up to 30.7.99 on payment of £150m.
In a separate DSS Agreement also signed on 24.5.99, all the Benefit
Payment Card related services were terminated. This was in full and
final settlement of all claims and counter claims. Transitional
arrangements were also put in place whereby ICL Pathway were to
be paid to remove existing Benefit Payment Card customers from
the system and return them to previous forms of payments, either by
order-book or Automated Credit Transfer (ACT).

The ICL contract with POCL remains a Service Contract, but only
for Core Services (EPOSS, APS and OBCS), remains in place until
March 2005, is paid for on a staged fixed price basis starting after
Acceptance, and POCL have the option at the end of the contract of
purchasing all the Project Assets from ICL Pathway for the sum of
£i.

Escalation processes are defined for both technical and legal issues
as necessary.

There remains an intention to work towards a form of
Public/Private/Partnership for network banking and Modern
Government, but these are not committed and are not part of the
Core Services.

3. POCL RESPONSE TO THE HMG DECISION

POCL and Post Office Board were seriously shocked by the decisions made
by HMT and DTI on their behalf covering the contractual terms and the
funding commitments which they now need to manage. They feel badly let
down by the public sector at large, and by DSS in particular. They clearly
have difficult and incomplete negotiations with the DSS yet to be finalised.

Their relationships, therefore, with ICL are very cool on all aspects of
partnership and future business, and are quite difficult at a working level as
they seek to squeeze as much out of the Codification exercise and
Acceptance as possible. Once we have cleared the hurdles of Codification,
Acceptance, and start of National Roll-out the atmosphere should improve.
We have a number of difficult months ahead.

4. CONTRACT PROGRESS

The joint work between ICL and POCL to complete the Codified
Agreement by 16.7.99 has kept to schedule. Good progress has been made
across a wide area, and although considerable work remains to be done, the
date of 16.7.99 is achievable with the goodwill and effort by both parties.

5. ACCEPTANCE PROGRESS

The contract calls for Acceptance to be achieved by 16.8.99. All the
preliminary work has been completed and trial results and completion
reviews are now with POCL for their assessment. Of the 240 Acceptance
Incidents raised, we have just one categorised as High. This incident is
serious, since it relates to the difficulties being experienced by the sub-Post
Masters in carrying out their stock and office balancing each Wednesday
evening. Although the ICL system is generally conformant to requirements,
it is proving too complex for most post office staff to handle. Considerable
effort is being applied to improve and simplify the business processes, the
software, the documentation and to improve training.

All other Acceptance Incidents are in the Low category, although we fully
expect a growing and increasingly difficult list to be lodged with us as the
mid-August deadline approaches.

6. NATIONAL ROLL OUT

This remains on target to start 23.8.99 and complete March 2001. The start
date is of course dependent on successful completion of Acceptance by
16.8.99.

7 ICL PATHWAY BUSINESS CASE PLAN
ICL took provision of (£180m) as an exceptional item in its Accounts for
1998/9 to cover all abortive costs arising from the DSS cancellation of the

benefit Payment Card services.

The attached Annex 1 summarises the expected revenues, profit and cash
flows over the contract life to March 2005.

8. SUMMARY
A revised contract with POCL is achievable by mid-July, and with the
planned capital injection of £132m from Fujitsu in 99/00, shows a PBT loss

of (£50m) prior to the opportunities which will arise from future business in
network banking, client re-engineering and Modern Government.
