Horizon report

KPMG LLP

Context

Purpose

In October 2020 POL engaged KPMG LLP (“KPMG”). Our scope included the
provision of an independent assessment of progress made by POL to address
Horizon Issues and provide recommendations against observations, allowing
POL to report into the ongoing Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (“The Inquiry”). This
report is the culmination of that activity.

Background

Post Office Limited (“POL”) is currently addressing historical findings in respect of
its core Branch computer system (“Horizon”). Horizon is used to record
transactions between POL and its Postmaster Branch network, and is owned,
maintained, and managed by Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”). A description of
Horizon is provided in Section 1.7.

Postmasters raised issues with Horizon, and these were linked to prosecution
and conviction’ of Postmasters for offences such as theft and false accounting.

In December 2019 POL settled with a group of claimants who established legal
action against POL in response to their convictions. Following this settlement, the
High Court ruled in the claimants’ favour and passed several Judgements. In
February 2020 a public inquiry was announced into the matter, with Terms of
Reference and the appointment of a Chair in September 2020.

The Terms of Reference of the Inquiry include “whether lessons have been
learned and concrete changes have taken place or are underway at Post Office
Ltd”, with respect to Judgment (No3) “Common Issues” and Judgment (No 6)
“Horizon Issues”. We use the term “Horizon Issues” in this report to refer to the
issues highlighted in Judgement No. 6.2

Requested scope

The engagement Terms of Reference can be found in Appendix 7: Engagement
Terms of Reference. The scope of the assessment was directed at six areas’, as
defined by POL. The following is an extract of the six in-scope areas:

’ Cases were referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission

2 Judgment (No.6) “Horizon Issues” December 2019 (Horizon Issues Judgement — HlJ)

3 These six areas are an amalgamation of Horizon Issues and in most cases do not follow a one-to-
one mapping with the HlJ — this is illustrated in Section 3.1.

1. Privileged Access Management: Establish who has what privileged access
to Horizon.

2. Remote Access** ®: Establish how remote access into the Post Office
network is conducted — both currently and pre-COVID — to include Branch
equipment and Branch Database (BRDB).

3. Software Development Lifecycle, Testing and Quality Assurance: Establish
how: i) changes to Horizon progress from requirements analysis through
development, testing and into early live support; and ii) how such changes
become fully live under mainstream support arrangements.

4. Known Error Logs (“KELs”) — current: Establish how Fujitsu are made aware
of an error.

5. Known Error Logs — historic: For each historic KEL establish whether the
condition remains or not. The Historic KELs cover 62 incidents from 1999
through to 2018.

6. Horizon Next Generation (HNGA) Robustness: Establish the functional and
non-functional robustness of Horizon Next Generation. A separate set of
reports have been produced to discuss robustness in more detail (refer to
sections entitled Appendix 8: Analysis, findings, and improvement
recommendations — Horizon AP-ADC scripts and reference data solution).

7. Appendix 9: Horizon IT Delivery Robustness Analysis — POL Horizon IT
Maturity Assessment. These reports use the KPMG IT Maturity Assessment
Tool, which is based on ITIL, COBIT and CMMi to assess maturity. Note that
the definition of robustness used in this report is the ITIL standard definition
and differs from the definition used within the Horizon Issues Judgement®.

Observations made in this Report relate to the situation we observed during the
period of our review from October 2020 to April 2021.

Our remit was to focus on the Horizon system and related processes. We did not
review the systems or infrastructure supported by Computacenter or Verizon.

4 Fujitsu use the term “remote access” interchangeably to cover both remote connectivity (the
technical act of connecting to a remotely-hosted system) and privileged access. Although not an
industry standard definition, for the purposes of our report and how these relate to Horizon Issues,
we agree with this simplification of terminology and have adopted a similar approach.

5 A number of remote access observed Horizon Issues are based upon the precursor to the current
version of Horizon, when Postmaster data was held on the Branch terminals.

® Please note that the robustness definition used within the Judgement is located at “Ref 54 page
21” of the Judgement documentation.

Approach

This report is based on document reviews, stakeholder meetings and discussions
over the course of 7 months from October 2020 (please see Appendix 1:
Documentation and Appendix 2: Contributors).

We would like to thank all those stakeholders involved in discussions and reviews
of early drafts.

Access to stakeholders and documents initially only included POL. Over time
access to Fujitsu enabled a wider perspective to be considered. We had initially
planned for the assessment to be completed over a shorter timescale. This was
not possible due to delays as we waited for Fujitsu to provide input in the form of
written responses to our questions. Details showing what form of access Fujitsu
took can be found in Section 1.7.

Observations are specific to the period October 2020 to April 2021.

Report iterations

Our observations have iterated during our review, as more information has come
to light from Fujitsu and POL stakeholders.

Report structure genesis

Our work began in October 2020 focusing on the six in-scope areas summarised
in Section 1.2 and Appendix 7: Engagement Terms of Reference. Over the first
few weeks, reviewing documentation and from discussion, it became apparent
that there were a series of more Foundational issues present, which if
unaddressed would hinder efforts to address Horizon Issues remediation work.

Our assessment ran in parallel to our wider contractual scope to document a
target operating model high-level design for the newly formed GLO/Horizon IT
function (Part B of our Terms of Reference, described in Appendix 7:
Engagement Terms of Reference).

1.6.1 Report structure

This report is split into three primary sections and the Appendices which list
documents reviewed and contributors that we have spoken to. Also documented
is short and long-term remediation efforts, programme planning and our Terms of
Reference.

1. Executive summary. We have observed that for remediation against the six
in-scope areas to take place there are six control areas that also need to be
addressed (see Section 3.7). These are necessary as they provide the
required foundations to facilitate sustained Horizon Issues improvement and
management whilst the move to a new IT platform is realised within the next
four plus years.

2. Observations in summary. In our early analysis we observed that several
areas of improvement were required across all six in-scope areas. Since this
early analysis, tactical improvement activity has begun, and longer-term
remediation is planned.

3. Observations in detail. We have documented 73 observations, structured
according to eight themes, aligned to the POL target operating model
planning: Governance, Processes, Capability, Culture and Conduct, Data,
Systems, Supplier and performance management and Technology.

What is Horizon?

In its simplest form ‘Horizon’ is a set of technologies, both software and
hardware, which exists physically in circa. 11,500 Branches and at the Fujitsu
Belfast datacenter, facilitating Postmasters to sell a wide variety of services to the
public (such as stamps or fishing licenses) and conduct limited Branch
administration (e.g. accounting, stock replenishment, communication with third
parties and external service providers, reporting and granting user access).

Horizon has existed since the late 1990’s after POL contracted International
Computers Limited (ICL), acquired by Fujitsu Limited in 2002, to design and build
it. Ownership and management of Horizon and intellectual property rights reside
with Fujitsu. The current version of Horizon is HNG-A or Horizon Next Generation
— Anywhere, which came into production 2017-18 as part of a phased
deployment. In February 2021, Horizon processed close to 160 million
transactions.

Strategic Platform Modernisation (SPM)

A major programme of activity, known as the Strategic Platform Modernisation
(SPM), will design an application architecture to replace Horizon software
components. This programme “is designed to improve robustness

and transparency, increase agility, refocus on core customers and products,
whilst supporting the Network Strategy (right services, right places, right
time)’’. It is due to commence in 2021 and run over the next 5-6 years.

In parallel, there is a proposal for POL to extract the part of Horizon that resides
in the Fujitsu Belfast datacentre and place it in a POL owned Amazon Web
Services instance.

Nature of Fujitsu involvement in this report

This overview is provided to describe the relationship between Fujitsu Business
Services Limited (Fujitsu) and Post Office Limited (POL) with specific reference to
the areas of focus within this report.

KPMG's review and report, referred to in the preceding section, has been
directed at both POL and Fujitsu as POL’s systems and infrastructure contribute
to the service provided to Postmasters as part of Horizon service.

KPMG was able to discuss and examine the appropriate areas of POL’s directly
managed estate and form views in discussion with service or platform owners.

Our original approach with Fujitsu was to perform a series of interviews,
document reviews and reviews of process related to the six in scope areas. This
approach could not be agreed with POL and Fujitsu, instead the approach was
built upon a series of exchanged written reports with follow-on written questions
and written responses. The reports and responses are itemised in Appendix 1:
Documentation. In the period referred to by this report we have been unable to
verify all the information provided in the reports or detail in subsequent responses
to queries raised by us, having requested but not being provided the opportunity
for technical walk-throughs of the approaches described.

Executive Summary

Overall Summary

The Inquiry shines a spotlight of expectation on POL, which can become
reality if a scale of change is met with significant remediation.

The Inquiry demands change and (data) integrity

One of the central tenets of the Horizon Issues Judgement (HIJ) is that POL must
change, restore, and sustain Postmasters confidence in POL’s ability to maintain
the integrity of their Branch data. Moreover, concerns over the reliability and
operation of Horizon must be addressed.

Key suppliers, in particular Fujitsu, are integral to the delivery of the current
Horizon service and to restoring confidence with Postmasters. The current
platform will need to be sustained over the coming 4+ years whilst POL migrates
to its new Postmaster-facing platform under the Strategic Platform Modernisation
Programme.

As a part of this, POL is required to demonstrate several things, including.

e  Anunderstanding of Postmasters and the demands they face as the
customer-facing sales force, by having effective lines of communication.

e An ability to manage and address risk in the broadest sense of the business
definition, both internally and, by extension of the approach, with its core
suppliers (in this case Fujitsu), supported by an effective risk management
and controls regime.

e Areliable application (be it Horizon or its replacement, the Strategic Platform
Modernisation (SPM)) including implementing appropriate user design,
following standard usability protocols, within a supportive environment for its
Branch network, be it direct or franchisee; and

«Inthe light of the Horizon Issues, a restoration in the belief by its workforce
and the public that it is well run, trusted and accountable.

Over the page we summarise our core conclusions.

Core conclusions

We have accounted for what the Inquiry demands, as well as the Horizon Issues
in drawing our conclusions.

In summary they are:

1. POL has made improvements responding to the Horizon Issues (see Section
2.2);

2. Significant remediation is still required across the six in-scope areas (see
Sections 2.3); and

3. The scale of change required is extensive, which includes the need to
address Foundational Issues (see Section 2.4).

Moving forwards

The culture of POL should reflect the Board's ambition to improve its engagement
and provision of service to Postmasters, embracing clear accountability as part of
a culture of a collective responsibility where changes, in areas such as vendor
management, roles, responsibilities, process, training and technology, will endure
within the new operating model.

POL must ensure that there is an alignment of all programmes that are directed
to the betterment of POL and its Postmaster business. This includes the SPM,
POL cultural programmes, and the Postmaster Journey programme with its
stated aim of “putting Postmasters at the heart of its business”.

POL needs to mirror its social purpose in its internal business engagement by
adapting and maturing as an organisation to embed and sustain improvements. It
needs to ensure these are driven through its public customer facing channel; that
of the Postmasters, and these must also be driven throughout the POL
organisation.

The migration programme to a new platform and branch-side application will
bring significant improvements. The expected delivery timeline for these needs to
be balanced against the desire to maintain Postmaster engagement on the
current platform. POL’s investment in improvement of the current platform rightly
needs to be balanced against that of investment in the future, but not to the
disadvantage of Postmasters, nor the public perception of improvements
expected in the immediate future.

Horizon report

KPMG LLP

Core conclusion 1

POL has made improvements since the Horizon Issues were raised.

Change is happening

In Autumn 2020 POL started to build a capability to be specifically responsible for
the management of the Horizon IT estate and its vendors. A GLO/Horizon IT
Director was appointed in September 2020 with a mandate to effect improvement
in Horizon and its supporting operations. This capability has begun to be
established, drawing upon current POL staff and experienced hires (amounting to
20 staff currently).

Remediation

With the support of POL leadership, the Horizon IT capability are driving both
short- and long-term remediation (see Appendix 5: Short-term Fast Fix tactical
remediation and Appendix 6: Long-term remediation planning).

Short-term Fast Fix tactical remediation

POL has instigated a Fast Fix programme which has prioritised what it believes to
be the most critical items to begin to address the Horizon Issues and, in
particular, the six prioritised areas described in Section 1.3 (see Appendix 5:
Short-term Fast Fix tactical remediation). The Fast Fix plan intends to deliver
initial improvements by the end of May 2021.

Long-term remediation

A further two phases of delivery are currently being planned for the next 24
months (see Appendix 6: Long-term remediation planning). The objectives of the
programme are specifically designed to address the Horizon issues and the
findings of this report. This will run in parallel with the SPM Programme.

The workstreams proposed in the 24-month programme are key to improving the
management of Horizon, both now and to its end of life, and importantly
embedding the structure and capabilities that will be critical to the delivery of
SPM and its subsequent running. However, any programme must have the
support of POL to succeed. To deliver this, each component of the programme
and the supporting POL organisation must have appropriate budgets and
understand its roles and responsibilities. Furthermore, there should be a POL-
wide understanding of risk, and processes to manage risk appropriate to its
potential impact.

At this point, it is encouraging to see the support from the Group Executive for the
long-term remediation programme that looks to the above. This will need to
endure for the length of the remediation — which will likely extend beyond 24-
months.

Horizon report

KPMG LLP

Moving forward

POL and the GLO/ Horizon IT team are making progress. The immediate
challenge however must be to ensure that any in-flight activities, such as data
migration from Fujitsu’s Belfast datacentre to a Post Office cloud-based
environment and the underlying arrangements, are assured as fit-for-future by
integrating them into the emerging activities.

The current Horizon operating model and that of the broader POL organisation
require sustained attention to transform the Post Office into a stable and future-
proof direct and franchise-based model. Our observations (in Section 4) have, by
necessity, looked to the organisation as well as the Horizon Issues.

The 24-month programme must start with an organisation which collaborates
internally as well as with its Postmasters and its vendors, delivers against the
Fast Fix-fix and addresses the Foundational Issues. Early steps should include:

« Establish an oversight board to coordinate and govern the remediation
programme;

e — Identify interdependencies between POL, vendors, and Horizon; and

e Review, update, and train staff in key roles of risk and governance.

Core conclusion 2

Significant remediation is still required across the six in-scope areas

Privileged Access Management and Remote Access? (see Section
3.2)

Across the entire Horizon domain, there is a low level of maturity, based upon
KPMG's Maturity assessment levels, namely - mostly manually based with an
uncoordinated approach across all the domains of Identity and Access
Management (IAM) including privilege/elevated access, authentication (for local
or remote access), joiner, mover and leaver management, and reporting.

Moreover, POL’s visibility of vendor (Fujitsu in particular) activity is limited and
this is not sufficiently challenged. Noting the lack of opportunity to test Fujitsu’s
responses as previously stated in Section 2, Fujitsu's approach, although in the
main based upon manual process, appears to be well documented.

Although remediation is in-flight (such as manual improvements to process, due
by end of May 2021) further work is needed to reach an ideal maturity level that
introduces automation, efficiency and reduces the risk of human error. POL can
address this by automating user enablement and management within its own
domain, introducing IAM tooling to improve its maturity to a point where it has full
visibility of all users including those within Fujitsu’s domain. Appropriate controls
should be agreed with Fujitsu and introduced to ensure timely approval and/or
visibility of Fujitsu user activity, thereby enabling POL to successfully manage all
users and what they can do when they gain access.

Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), Testing and Quality
Assurance (see Section 3.3)

The overall governance and control of the SDLC and Testing processes within
POL, and with respect to delivering technical change for Horizon, is immature
when measured against industry standard frameworks. For example, no formal
Release Management process is in place. Actions are being taken to uplift these

® We have considered privileged access management (PAM) and remote access (RAM) within this
report in the context of the nature of data being accessed, the risk or concern exposed in doing so
and the approaches to properly control and report on these activities. As such, our observations
consider a wider approach to access than that of an industry standard view of privileged access,
driven by use cases we have seen. These include the ability for users to act on behalf of others,
such as Postmasters or engineers, and finance staff, who, although they are carrying out their daily
routine in accessing Postmasters’ financial records could be deemed to have access which should
be seen as privileged.

In Footnote 4 on page 7 we describe Fujitsu’s view of remote connectivity and privileged access;
this broadly fits with the interpretation we have made for our work and aligns with a lay view, which

processes, and appropriate controls are now being implemented. However, this is
not a quick fix, and will require time to fully embed. As such they have been
allocated to the long-term remediation planning.

Known Error Logs (KELs) — current (see Section 3.4)

Fast fix activity has improved the handling of current KELs, with the
commissioning of a dedicated owner and a support team, to take control of the
KELs and drive them to conclusion (i.e. rectification, retest, and closure). Further
updates and refinements to the new process are currently being implemented
(expected completion of 30° May), and tighter controls have been put in place,
such as standard templates for capturing KEL details, quality checks, detailed
technical analysis, and status tracking. Buy-in and commitment from the third
parties (including Fujitsu) has likewise improved.

Known Error Logs — historic (see Section 3.5)

To date 45 of the 62 Historic KELs have been closed. POL and Fujitsu both now
have sets of actions to work through to facilitate the testing and closure of the
remaining historic KELs, expected to be closed by end of June. POL and Fujitsu
have held joint technical workshops, and these have enabled a deeper level of
analysis of the historic KELs. Test activity for the remaining outstanding historic
KELs has commenced.

Horizon Next Generation (HNGA) Robustness (see Section 3.6)

Work to address HNGA robustness has included improving and restructuring the
Architectural approach, updating the AP-ADC script delivery process and refining
change delivery.

Despite these improvements there remain several areas in relation to
Governance, Process and Management of Horizon which introduce the potential
for issues to occur with Horizon.

Our overall conclusions in this area are that:

1. The platform itself is not managed, from an end-to-end perspective, in a
mature manner, when measured against industry frameworks such as ITIL,
COBIT and CMMi; and

2. The delivery of technical change into the Horizon platform is not handled in a
mature and well-governed manner, although rapid improvements are being
made through the Change Management process.

As a result, this has the potential for changes introduced to cause detrimental
impact and increases the risk of incidents due to system errors and/or failures
when implementing changes. Without more mature processes in place, and

governed appropriately, POL is not effectively managing the Horizon platform.

Horizon report

KPMG LLP

Our conclusions drawn in this area are informed by two detailed reports included
at Appendix 8: Analysis, findings, and improvement recommendations — Horizon
AP-ADC scripts and reference data solution and Appendix 9: Horizon IT Delivery
Robustness Analysis — POL Horizon IT Maturity Assessment.

A summary is provided here.

Horizon AP-ADC scripts and reference data solution

A core tenet of HNGA is reference data and AP-ADC scripting. Reference data is
how much of the Horizon user functionality is configured and created. AP-ADC
scripts are a means of coding sequences of transactions executed by Branch
staff or changing current transaction flows. Both mechanisms are created,
changed, and deployed by POL with minimal input from Fujitsu.

AP-ADC scripts and reference data elements are not primary causes of error and
discrepancy; they are simply tools used by POL staff to introduce change into the
Horizon platform. However, due to the lack of appropriate controls and
governance regarding how this change is introduced, it is possible for incidents,
discrepancy, detriment, and reputational harm to occur. For instance:

e The design of the user interface and the Postmaster experience, as defined
by POL, is not considered from the perspective of user-centricity;

e The way in which POL manage change of user functionality is immature; and

e The way in which POL test change does not account for user testing, which
would ordinarily allow weaknesses in the solution to be identified

However, the potential to cause discrepancy is partly mitigated by the controls
the reference data team put in place while building reference data and AP-ADC
scripts.

POL Horizon IT Maturity Assessment

KPMG assessed the robustness of the Horizon IT capability, by analysing how
Horizon IT Services are delivered against pre-defined maturity levels from the
industry standard framework for the delivery of IT services, ITIL, COBIT and
CMMi and KPMG's reference IT Maturity Assessment Tool.

An assessment of 22 areas points to low maturity. Across the cycle of plan,
develop, build, test, release & deploy, run & operate, monitor & improve, and
manage & govern remediation is needed. For example: POL does not have a
Release Management process, and the Release Manager role is taken by the
Service Managers, who approve what is released into the live environments.

leadership and management to facilitate greater Postmaster reassurance
that POL has control of its business and suppliers; and

e _ individuals have been primarily concerned with their own area of
responsibility with insufficient collaboration or questioning of others, leading
to a sustaining of the status quo that existed.

There is now a change in approach from POL that is addressing the previous lack
of consistent, reliable management of Horizon; process, frameworks and
approaches are being established or reviewed and changed. The perceived lack
of collective responsibility is changing but the change must be embedded
culturally.

Further, SPM with its intent is “to improve robustness and transparency, increase
agility, refocus on core customers and products, whilst supporting the Network
Strategy (right services, right places, right time)” must be accounted for in the
content of these Foundational Issues. We have discussed the content of our report
with POL Leadership. The Foundational Issues we have raised must be addressed to
effectively embed and sustain the change that is needed. Some of these are being
introduced in workstreams within the overall Horizon Improvements Programme V1.0, a
copy of the current draft plan for which is at Section 5.5.4.

3.2 Privileged access management and remote access

Across the entire Horizon domain, there is a low level of maturity which is mostly manually based and has an uncoordinated approach
across all domains of Identity and Access Management including privilege/elevated access, authentication, and controls. Moreover,
visibility of vendor activity is limited, and this has not been sufficiently challenged.

The observations that align to pri

ileged access management and remote access are as follows:

Narrative

The current POL approach to Identity and Access Management (IAM) has a low level of maturity based
upon industry standard measures, characterised by limited automation, undocumented processes and
oversight that does not sufficiently examine or challenge vendor activity. The reliance on third parties
does not alleviate this due to contractual and operational limitations. Please see Fujitsu, below in
respect of vendor monitoring and reporting.

The low maturity of IAM and complexity of the POL/Horizon estate makes management of users and
their access rights, and the reporting of this, inefficient and subject to human error as there is no single
view of all users who access Horizon and its supporting systems.

Because of the current state of their identity data and processes, and vendors reporting, it is difficult for
POL to confidently state or demonstrate that it has good control over users and their appropriate and
timely access to Postmaster data.

3. User
identification,
access
management and
reporting

User lifecycle management (i.e. JML) is not timely causing exposure to users who should be removed
from systems still being present, with the ability to gain inappropriate access. Re-approval of access
(certification) checks are manually driven, and response rates are insufficient for POL to be confident of
their effectiveness. This undermines POL’s ability to adequately control timely and appropriate access
to systems.

Certification is not carried out to uniform times across the user and application base, which further
exposes POL in respect of users with accumulated or conflicting access rights giving excessive

A user type known as APPSUP is used for non-balance impacting (financial) actions, such as correcting
corrupted transactions, removing blocked user sessions, or rolling over trading periods. This provides a

Narrative

During our review, we observed that the overarching accountability, ownership and responsibility for
the management and control aspects of Horizon was not clearly defined; this was subsequently
resolved in Feb 2021 with the appointment of a Horizon Product Owner. This Product Owner is now
taking formal ownership of the Horizon Platform, with sign-off responsibility for change. A Product
Strategy has not yet been developed, so the overall, detailed lifecycle for Horizon has not been
implemented. This could lead to change being implemented in an ad hoc and fragmented manner,
which does not align with the long-term POL strategy for the platform.

POL recognise that contract and vendor management need to be improved to enable meaningful
engagement and outputs. Plans are being implemented to change the structure and approach in this
important area.

5. Test Governance

During our review, we observed that was no effective test governance in place. This was partially
resolved in Jan 2021 with the appointment of a senior test manager to take ownership of testing within
the Horizon IT team. Up until that appointment, testing provided by third parties was accepted by POL
unchallenged, and POL did not conduct any analysis or detailed review of the test results provided by
the third parties, and there was no evaluation of the third part test outputs for quality standards or
coverage requirements - as the party responsible for the Horizon platform, POL would be expected to
ensure that third party testing met both industry and POL internal best practice, and without
appropriate test governance structures in place, it is not possible to perform this task. There is now
effort in place to rectify this gap.

There was no organisational Test Policy, test framework, test approach or test tooling in place to
support POL test effort, and to guide and control third party test delivery. All test activity was
outsourced to Fujitsu and ATOS, and POL retained no test knowledge, or staff skilled in testing, and so
was fully reliant upon the third parties. As POL had no structure in place to validate the test approach
(e.g. no quality gates were in place), scope and outputs being delivered from the third parties, there
were gaps which enabled issues to leak out into Production. Actions are now being taken to implement
and improve the overarching approach to testing.

There is no requirements traceability matrix in place, and traceability between test artefacts and
business requirements and design is incomplete or missing. Thus, there is no apparent way to validate
test coverage and scope.

POL lack a clearly defined test environment and test data strategy. The test environments for Horizon
are owned and managed by Fujitsu, however POL should have a detailed understanding of the
structure of the test environments, as well as the test data within those environments. This is to ensure

that the test environments remain reflective of the Production environment, otherwise the test
environments are not supporting accurate and appropriate test effort.

6. SDLC
Governance

POL does not have a Project Delivery Capability Framework in place, and there is no standardised
SDLC delivery methodology or Project Management Lifecycle. Individual programmes can implement
their own delivery mechanisms, which means that there is no consistency between ongoing
programmes. Likewise, governance and control vary between programmes, with each individual
programme structuring their own controls.

management Product Lifecycle in place. This was partially resolved in Feb 2021, with the appointment of a Product

Owner for Horizon. The lack of a Product Owner indicates that there was no one single person with an
overarching and holistic view of all the changes ongoing across the Horizon platform, with a clear and
concise understanding of how these changes impact POL's business and customer front end. Without
a Product Owner in place, there was no single approver for these changes, and no single person with a
clear, strategic view of the platform's lifecycle. There was a risk that change introduced into the
platform would not align with POL's long term, strategic goals, and that disparate change could conflict
or overwrite other change being introduced at the same time.

The level of involvement from architects across the change being delivered into Horizon is limited;
within POL there is a poor understanding of the Horizon enterprise and system architecture. There is
limited understanding within POL of how Horizon works, what it does, and how change can be

effectively applied. This has improved throughout 2021, as the recently hired enterprise architect team
is reconstituting POL's understanding of the platform.

14. Testing POL does not perform appropriate and effective End-to-End, User Acceptance or Non-Functional
Testing.
Regression testing is patchy and poorly applied to the platform, and is not executed from a business
user perspective, only from a technical functional perspective (if it is executed at all). The lack of
regression testing has led to Production incidents occurring, with some of the Historic KELs being
examples of these problems.
15. Change POL has recently (Q1 2021), tightened up and improved its change control process; however not all
Management change is funnelled through the improved process as yet (Reference Data is governed separately), and
further updates are expected to occur in May and June of 2021.Whilst there has been improvement
since KPMG's initial analysis in Q4 2020, there is still a great deal of further improvement yet to be
implemented.
7. Supplier and =I 20. Vendor Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) appear to be poorly defined,
performance performance with performance against the KPI and SLAs being self-reported by Fujitsu, with no subsequent
management management independent assurance activities being undertaken by POL as part of its own governance structure.
8. Technology 21. Tool There is no standard change delivery tool used to capture User Journeys, business and technical
Support for change requirements, design documentation, project management components (such as scheduling,
delivery resourcing, costs, etc.), or test management components (e.g. schedule, test scripts, test results, test

evidence). Spreadsheets are used to manage some projects, which implies that many of the standard
project tasks are performed manually, that there is no clear traceability, and no version control / access
control to project documentation (so there is no change audit tracing).

N/A

Narrative

Initially, the management of the current KELs was considered a “side-of-desk” best efforts endeavour
added to the workload of the Horizon Operations team. The bulk of the process was owned and
operated by Fujitsu, with POL involved but not directing or controlling the process. The KELs were
tracked via spreadsheet, which was updated by Fujitsu, and tracked the Fujitsu based actions.

This approach was changed with the creation of the GLO IT Team, and a POL senior staff member,
with a support team, was tasked to take ownership of the management of the current KELs to ensure
that these outstanding items are appropriately managed, tracked and resolved.

Anew process to manage KELs has been designed and has now been implemented and embedded
across all stakeholders (since Jan 2021). This process will be automated and coordinated via Service
Now (per Project Management documentation expected completion is May 2021), whereas previously
it was spreadsheet based. Weekly reports are being produced to track the progress on resolving the
current KELs, and there is oversight with a Change Advisory Board (CAB) in place. The CAB is
staffed by the appropriate SMEs and people with the required seniority to make (and sign off on)
decisions. Third party engagement is currently in place, and the third parties are onboarded to the
new process; teams within POL are likewise onboarded and involved.

16. KELs (Historic)

Narrative

The initial supplied documentation regarding the historic KELs was limited, and focused on the
business components / impacts of each KEL.

For proper analysis, to determine the underlying root cause of the KEL, technical details were
required.

Detailed technical workshops were held jointly by POL and Fujitsu, with the appropriate technical and
operations staff involved, to tease out the required details to enable the analysis of these historic
KELs.

From these workshops, POL and Fujitsu were able to determine that 45 of the 62 items could be
closed, as the core system and functionality had extensively changed since these KELs occurred, and
due to these changes, these specific problems could not occur again.

Of the remaining 17, POL and Fujitsu were able to determine that 14 required retesting, to validate
that they no longer exist within the platform. This retesting effort is being jointly run by Fujitsu and
POL, and is currently underway. Note that if this retesting does show the KEL is still extant, then the
required remediation will be implemented to ensure the KEL is resolved.

Three of the historic KELs lack sufficient detailed technical information to determine what caused the
issue. They also lack enough business information to determine what business process led to the
issue occurring. At the time of writing, further discussion between POL and Fujitsu on the actions to

be taken on these three items is planned to take place in the w/c 26" April 2021.

3.6 Horizon Next Generation (HNGA) Robustness

Whilst the high-level components for Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery are in place, there is a lack of detailed information and
planning currently available. Usability and user interface design seems to be lacking, and is not included in the overall solution design for

the Horizon platform's user interface.

The observations that align to HNGA robustness are as follows:

Recovery (DR)

Narrative

.

Whilst there is a Business Continuity Policy in place, the next level plans do not exist. Without the
business continuity plans for each business unit in place, there is no clear understanding of how the
business units respond to an outage.

There is no consideration for resilience at the architectural level, the impact of which is that the
solutions may not be fit for purpose from a BCP / DR point of view.

POL has no Business Impact Assessments (BIA) in place across the wider POL business landscape.
BIAs are a standard component of a BCP, and inform the overall BCP approach and structure, and
help prioritise the DR approach.

There is no clear linkage between the BCP approach and the DR approach, and the two areas act in
siloes, where they should be tightly coordinated.

DR is disparate, and focuses on individual systems in isolation. This is due to the nature of the
technological landscape within POL, with numerous third parties responsible for different areas of the
overarching service. POL is not performing the required role of end owner and coordinator.

The DR approach is to repeat the same tests year on year, with no updates for results and changes to
the systems.

e Both the BCP manager and DR manager are coordinating teams of one (themselves). Based on the
volume of work, and the complexity of the landscape, larger teams would be expected.

e  AP-ADC scripts and Reference data changes are not consistently captured within the DR space, and
can be missed. This can cause issues with the DR testing, where the tests are not fully reflective of
Production. This is further discussed in the “Horizon AP-ADC scripts and reference data solution”
paper. Additionally, please note that the extent of this problem is difficult to quantify since there is not
a reliable record of how many AP-ADC scripts there are in production.

relevant.

3.7. Foundational Issues

Post Office Limited

KPMG LLP

Foundational Issues are also present which go to the core of POL’s ability to sustainably address the six in-scope areas

In assessing the six in-scope areas, we have identified a number of Foundational Issues that must be addressed to help underpin and

sustain the required improvements as part of the Remediation Programme being put in place. They are summarised here and highlighted

within the relevant observations within Section 4 (see Page 40 for our reading guide).

POL should consider the likelihood of these issues being reflective across the broader organisation, and having a much wider impact than

just the six in-scope areas. Resolving these issues requires that organisational-wide policies, processes, and approaches are in place,

and that these are effective.

oundational issue

1. RACI. The accountability, ownership and responsibility for all management and control aspects on Horizon is not
clearly defined between POL, Fujitsu, and other vendors. Notable gaps exist in vendor management, service
performance management and contract renewal.

2. Compliance. There is not sufficient collaboration in planning, monitoring and oversight of Horizon/broader POL IT

4. Three lines of defence (3LoD). The Second Line and Third Lines of Defence do not seem to work in coordination Section 4.4.2
and appear to operate independently. Review and assessment of Horizon is provided by Fujitsu (via monthly reports);
this self-assessment is not challenged by POL, and there seems to be no independent review of Horizon by POL 3LoD
staff. Internal Audit reviews conducted by 3LoD tend to be thematic rather than risk based, and do not delve into
Horizon-orientated IT controls to determine the effectiveness of these controls.

5. Contractual Arrangements. The strategic IT vendor management process is performed on an ad-hoc basis rather Section 4.4.3.
than at regular, set intervals. These ad-hoc reviews do not apply the latest business needs or re-evaluation of the
required service levels against the contracts. It is noted that vendor management is currently managed separately
within POL to contract management, which deals purely with contract compliance. The intention going forward is for
these activities to be more closely aligned.

6. IT Controls Framework. Weaknesses have been identified across the IT controls capability, including issues with Section 4.4.7
content, application of the framework, reporting, governance, and technology. An effective IT risk capability requires
each of these elements to be functioning correctly.

7. POL Horizon capabilities and Culture There has been an apparent lack of defined, understood or acknowledged Section 4.5.1 and 4.6
job roles in respect of incumbents’ responsibilities and accountabilities in relation to Horizon, which is also observed by
POL representatives, to have created an insufficiently collaborative and questioning culture. This has been especially
noticeable regarding implementing change to support the Judgement issues. Detailed planning to fully address the
Judgement findings is still in development. There has been limited technical ability and consequential willingness to
challenge vendors within supplier relationships, with the contractual management frameworks being trusted as fit for
purpose.

9. Pll at rest and in transit. POL is not Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant. Horizon Section 4.7.1
contains Pll data - managed by Fujitsu - with data at rest and in transit not being encrypted.

10. Key dependencies. Migration to AWS as part of the Belfast Exit is in-flight however POL still have a significant
number of decisions to make (i.e. whether to stay with Fujitsu to manage Horizon or not, integration or migration of
legacy product services onto AWS).

Section 4.8.1

11. Vendor management performance. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are too high-level, without well-defined
service performance metrics, which is self-reported by Fujitsu and no subsequent independent assurance activities
being undertaken by POL. Horizon service performance is overseen through different governance routes such as the
Information Security Management Forum (ISMF) and Service Management Report (SMR).

Section 4.9.1

12. Tools for IAM and GRC. The use of appropriate tooling to improve efficiency, consistency of process and security
is limited and further investment in the use of currently owned and new tooling will deliver significant improvements.

Horizon governance roles and responsibilities

Rating Serious I In-scope area mapping

Observations and impact

1A. The accountability, ownership and responsibility for management and control
aspects of Horizon is being addressed following the establishment of the new
GLO/ Horizon IT function and the design of a governance structure which clearly
defines these matters between POL, Fujitsu, and other vendors. Additionally, POL
has engaged Fujitsu in the design of the new governance structure with the aim
of taking learnings to relationships with other vendors. Importantly, the model
being created will enable POL to migrate from Horizon to the future state under
the Strategic Platform Modernisation and contribute to ensuring its success.

e — Roles and responsibilities within the POL GLO/ Horizon IT function are forming and
recruitment continues to build the team. The recommendations made are being
addressed, however, this needs to be executed well and at speed to ensure that
the impetus of the initial build up is not lost and an appropriate critical mass is
achieved for the function so as not to impact the overall programme's timelines or
scope.

Recommenda'

1Ai. Implement a POL vendor management policy against which vendors can be
measured and that clearly defines the vendor management lifecycle with defined
processes, POL expectations for vendor management (such as service performance
management), establishes accountability, ownership, and responsibilities.

1Aii. Within the vendor management policy, establish clear roles and responsibilities
between POL, Fujitsu, and other vendors for management of Horizon, such as change,
new releases, PAM / RAM, and testing.

1Aiii. Within the IT controls framework include relevant vendor management process
and controls for governance, governance oversight, service performance requirements
and communicate to all Horizon vendors.1Aiv. Design and roll out training for relevant
role holders to ensure they understand their current roles and responsibilities and, as
changes are made, ensure revisions are understood and accepted.

4.3.2 Vendor management governance and oversight

Rating Serious In-scope area mapping SDLC and Foundational

Observations and impact

2A. The implementation of a revised model for vendor management has

commenced. Until this is fully developed and embedded with vendors, gaps in
process and continuation the activities which were allowed by a poorly defined
service performance management model will pervade.

«Until fully embedded within POL and with vendors, POL could be subject to
oversights in vendor management which cause it to face and further reputational
damage due to vendor shortcomings. This was confirmed during discussions with
POL representatives (29-Oct-2020, 3-Nov-2020, 24-Feb-2021 and 09-Mar-2021),
though no formal evidence has been supplied at this point in time.

2B. Since our initial analysis, the contractual management framework is being
addressed and the changes required are understood.

e  Ateam is in place, although the process of renegotiating the required and expected
contractual controls to follow industry good practice for similar vendor contracts,
and moving from the current service levels which are not tightly defined nor
measurable needs vendor agreement and commercial agreement otherwise
changes will rely on the good faith of vendors and not be enforceable. This is
evidenced by review of the provided “Contract Management Framework Final
2020” and during discussions with POL representatives (29-Oct-2020 and 09-Mar-
2021).

Recommendati

2Ai. Perform a gap analysis between the vendor management policy and the existing
vendor management and service management processes. Identified gaps should be
used to formulate process(es) and controls that should be implemented.

2Aii. Newly formed process(es) and controls should then be included in the IT controls
framework, where they should be monitored, reported and self-assessed as per the
vendor management policy defined intervals (also please refer to recommendation 1Ai
and observation 13A).

2Aiii. Within the boundaries of what can reasonably be achieved, vendor contracts
should be updated to match and meet POL expectations of vendor delivery. Appropriate
KPls and SLAs need to be included within the contract.

2Aiv. Contract agreements should be discussed with relevant service areas (e.g. a
business service that requires IT support should have the service levels and
requirements approved by IT to ensure they align with existing/dependent services).

2Bi. Review the existing Contractual Management framework against the ‘National Audit
Office Good Practice Contract Management Framework’ and update the existing POL
framework accordingly.

4.3.3 User identification, access management and reporting
There are two risk gradings in this section.

In-scope area mapping PAM / RAM

Observations and impact

3A. The current POL approach to Identity and Access Management (IAM) has a
low level of maturity based upon industry standard measures, characterised by
little automation, undocumented processes, and limited oversight although Fast
Fix improvements are underway - see 3Ai and 3G (below).

3B. Governance and admi is heavily decentralised and, in part, owned
by third parties. POL has ight or visibility into suppliers with no
contracted means of gaining this with Fujitsu. Please also see 3M — regarding
Fujitsu/vendor IAM.

« — The impact of observations at 3A and 3B is that POL is unable to provide sufficient
assurance that user access, such as privileged access, is sufficiently well managed
and the integrity of Postmasters' data is therefore protected. Moreover, the lack of
a mature and consistent approach means that POL cannot currently demonstrate
control over the risk of unauthorised or unaccountable access to critical
infrastructure and systems, i.e. overall, POL cannot prove or verify who has or had
access to what and why. This was confirmed during discussions with POL.
representatives (9-Nov-2020 and 17-Nov-2020) and further discussions throughout
Feb-21 and March-21.

3C. Due to the decentralised model for identity within POL and the challenge
presented by third party user maintenance, there is no consolidated source of
truth for internal or third-party users (Fujitsu, Accenture, CC).

e — This compounds POL's inability to create a consistent framework for IAM where
joiners, movers and leavers are managed on a timely, easily audited manner; nor
can POL maintain visibility into who has access to what across its Branches nor
supporting organisation and vendors.

e Without a single source of identity, correlation of users to system accounts is
difficult as identity formats are inconsistent.

« Without a consolidated view of users, POL is unable to resolve the issues caused
by the current decentralised approach, nor correlate or control third party user
activity itself. This was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (17-
Nov-2020).

3D. Joiner-Mover-Leaver (user lifecycle management - “JML”) governance is
inefficient and inconsistent across POL with approval of access rights
(certification), access approvals and reporting run separately for different user
groups.

3G. POL defined Branch network roles such as Branch Managers, Auditor E, and
Admin do not have any Segregation of Duties (SOD) rules in the system and
allocation of roles is inconsistent. The creation process is paper based and does
not check for SOD, and the recertification process does not check for adherence
to the joiner processes.

e This exposes franchise owners (Postmasters), Branch management, staff, and
POL to the risk of accusations regarding inappropriate activity, deniability of
actions, misuse of privileges and to insider threat. This was evidenced during
discussions with POL representatives (17-Nov-2020), subsequent discussions in
Feb, March and April-2021, and email received (26-Nov-2020, 14:22) “RE: Global
User Admin Access.msg”.

Please also refer to Process: User journeys, approvals, and controls processes.

3H. User access review timings are not uniform; remediation tracking is not
streamlined and mostly manual. Six-monthly access reviews are conducted by
the Data Services Team for Global Users, which include Fujitsu users, and CFS
(financial system), by emailing users’ respective line managers. The response
rates to the reviews are not satisfactory nor timely.

e The window of exposure to accumulated privileges/inappropriate access is
between 6-12 months, assuming responses are obtained. This was evidenced
during discussions with POL representatives (17-Nov-2020), various meetings in
February and March and reviews of emails received (24-Nov-2020) “FW: Global
User accounts - removal from stock units.msg”.

e Although leaver checks are carried out weekly based on a report from HR, with
remediation taking between 1 — 6 days, there is still a residual access exposure of
7 - 14 days. This was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (17-
Nov-2020).

3J. Reporting of PAM and APPSUP user account activity is provided by Fujitsu to
POL ISMF on a monthly basis although this is not a contracted requirement for
Fujitsu.

3K. The Fujitsu Security Report, which includes RA and APPSUP log details and
joiner-mover-leaver activity, is being revised as a part of the Fast Fix programme
to introduce: a Unique identification (UID) for users, PAM elevation occurrences with
additional platform detail, and an agreed monthly delivery date for the report. This will
enable users to be consistently viewed month to month and provide improved visibility
of the systems they access. This was confirmed in discussions with POL and Fujitsu
representatives at a series of meetings in March and April 2021.

3L. KeePass/generic privileged accounts (see 11G, Section 4.4.6) are not
reported.

e — The report whilst improving visibility is still limited in detail and scope and inhibits
POL's ability to ensure Fujitsu manages its user in a timely manner. The lack of
detail in the report may cause POL staff to not consider its content as having
sufficient value and therefore not challenge its content.

3N. Although Fujitsu maintain logs for the various systems, the point is made by
Fujitsu in their RA report to POL (see Appendix 1: Documentation) that, “logs are
extremely large and interspersed with other activity logging”.

e — The lack of ability to extract meaningful logs causes POL to be heavily reliant upon
the monthly retrospective Security Report and inhibits POL's visibility of user
activity. Fujitsu have previously suggested enhancing log reporting by deploying
additional tooling, but this has been deemed cost prohibitive. This was confirmed
during written exchanges with Fujitsu referred to at Appendix 1: Documentation
although KPMG has been unable to test this with Fujitsu.

Recommendatio:

3Ai. POL has commenced a remediation programme (Fast Fix) to prioritise high-
tisk/Horizon Issues-related exposure points, review, remediate and improve, and
document manual processes for governance to improve consistency, ensure
appropriate approvals and traceability (auditability) of requests/actions taken.

3Aii. Continue 3Ai activities whist developing a roadmap to move from a primarily
manually driven, undocumented approach to user lifecycle and access management to
one which is optimised and ensures a consistent, auditable, and cost effective approach
with strong policy, controls and accountability for identity and access management.

SAiii. Execute against the roadmap to a risk-based approach, supported by a suitable IT
controls framework (see Section 4.4.7.

IT Controls Framework).

3Bi. Establish strong policy, controls, and accountability within POL Horizon team and
with vendors for identity and access management/governance for third-party users.

Please see Observation 3M regarding Fujitsu/vendor IAM observations.

3Ci. Establish a single source of truth for identity of all users or by user type
(employees, non-employees (third parties), service accounts etc.) and have reliable
correlation between accounts and users.

3Cii. Examine the feasibility and implement a means of obtaining live user data from
vendors to enable active management and visibility of users across the Horizon estate
OR create a consolidated view for third party users (in particular Fujitsu) and consider
use of a reporting tool to aid governance and understanding of third party users.

Please see Recommendation 3M regarding Fujitsu reporting.

3Ciii. Please see Section 4.10.3 Technology — Tools for [AM and GRC — which
highlights existing tooling which should be considered as a part of this approach.

3Di. Establish central and unified JML processes, including immediate termination of
rights for movers and leavers, with associated SLAs for users across Branches, global
users, and third-party users.

3Gi. Review elevated access and identify toxic combinations. Establish strong SOD
policies and a process to handle violations, exceptions and remediations.

3Gii. Planning is underway as a part of Fast Fix to ensure that POL creates and
implements documented governance processes to ensure that roles are consistently
and appropriately allocated to users, whilst developing a broader Identity and Access
Management strategy.

3Hi. Identify all applications that impact the Horizon estate including CFS, re-define the
frequency of access recertification (continued access rights) based upon level of risk,
ownership, and SLA's for access remediation.

3Hii. Reduce manual intervention in the access recertification and remediation process
through automation.

SHilii. Identify Fast Fix components to reduce risk, such as increasing the frequency of
access reviews and suspending users where there is no activity or where managers
have not responded.

3Ji. The provision of the report should be formalised within the existing Fujitsu-POL
contractual framework.

3Ki. POL changes to address the observations are currently being discussed and
should be seen as the minimum reporting requirement for POL. These include a Unique
identification (UID) for users, PAM elevation occurrences with additional platform detail
and an agreed delivery date for the report.

3kii. ISMF should act upon the contents of the report to demonstrate the value of the
proposed improvements and POL Internal Audit reviews should consider the extent to
which reports have been challenged and appropriate actions taken.

3Li. Additional changes to reporting should include reporting of PAM account changes
(i.e. changes in privileges) and use of KeePass/generic privileged accounts (See
Section 4.4.6 User journeys, approvals, and controls processes: Fujitsu HZ-managed_
environment).

See 3N regarding log production and automation.

3Ni. Consideration should be given to improving the approach to log capture and
analysis.

3Nii. As a part of the Identity and access management strategy being developed,
specific to the Fujitsu estate, consideration should be given to session recording or key
logging for specific activities. This enhanced visibility would alleviate the problem
described by Fujitsu regarding logs.

Please see Recommendation (3K) regarding improvements to the current reporting
process.

Observations and impact

3E. The Governance (approvals) for Global users and CFS (POL’s SAP system)
are manually managed by approvers from historic lists. It is our understanding
that Fast Fix improvements are being commenced to resolve this — see 3Eli.

« The impact of observations 3D and 3E is the approaches are inefficient, prone to
error and consequently falls short in providing a service to deliver an effective
joiner-mover-leaver process for any user type. This can result in accumulation of
access, violation of least privilege policy and insider threat. This was evidenced
during discussions with POL representatives (5 Nov-2020, 17-Nov-2020)and
subsequent meetings in March and April-21 and review of email received (26-Nov-
2020, 14:22) “RE: Global User Admin Access.msg’.

3F. Within the POL domains there are limited policies and no guidance or controls
that are sufficient to manage enablement/approval of users, including for elevated
access, with activities being accepted common practice and/or relying on historic
documents and lists.

Manual controls are being improved and documented through the Fast Fix
programme whilst a broader Identity and access management strategy is
developed.

e This results in a lack of meaningful governance, thus evidencing, of the approval
processes and exposure to risk of inappropriate access. This was evidenced in
conversations with POL Data Services Team 25" March 2021 and Horizon Live
Service Team during February and March 2021.

31. Postmasters have full access to Branch user management functions, such as
create Horizon accounts, and management of passwords for these accounts
independently of POL’s Data Services Team. Elevation of user authority i
Branches is not reviewed or controlled by POL. POL Branch user adi ration
is inefficient and the expediency of an informal approach to allow a Branch to run
effectively by retaining or sharing user accounts is a known issue with no
current practical resolution. The team managing users report that over 90% of
Branch leavers are not notified to POL.

e The ability to share accounts, creation of accounts with incorrect ownership, and
use of such accounts to conduct transactions exposes franchise owners, Branch
management, staff and POL to the risk of accusations regarding inappropriate
activities, albeit that the employer in the POL-franchised Branches is the business
owner, i.e. the Postmaster. This was confirmed during discussions with POL
representatives (3-Nov-2020) and subsequent discussions in March and April-21.

e  Postmasters are currently provided with temporary access to global access roles
(due to COVID remote help) which allows them elevated access. This was
confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (17-Nov-2020).

Please also refer to ‘Section 4.4.5 User journeys, approvals, and controls processes’ in
respect of SmartiD/Branch user process.

3M. Certi tion (user access rights governance) is a well-documented manual
process supported by spreadsheets and email requests). It is performed ona
monthly basis. Access revocation is either by an Assignment Manager’s
instruction, as part of the monthly verification process, inactivity of more than 90

days or during a security spot check outside of the monthly certification
(verification) process. Segregation of duties (checking a user’s role doesn’t
conflict) is additionally managed as part of a second monthly check.

e — The well-documented manual process relies upon human diligence for timeliness
and thorough responses; thus, errors could occur, allowing inappropriate access. A
window of 90 days for inactivity is an excessive risk exposure. This was confirmed
during written exchanges with Fujitsu referred to at Appendix 1: Documentation
although KPMG has been unable to test this with Fujitsu.

Recommendatio:

3Ei. Pending any automation process, POL is remediating this by updating the
approvers lists and ensuring these are maintained on a quarterly basis.

3Fi. In line with the improvements at 3Ai and 3Aii, documentation, guides and training
should be developed, including improving current manual controls and approver lists for
all systems or processes that hold critical data. The current Fast Fix plan addresses this
for areas including CFS and POL approvals for Fujitsu elevated activities — see
Appendix 5: Short-term Fast Fix tactical remediation for a high-level view of the Fast Fix
programme.

3Fii. Ensure all processes are appropriately monitored and reviewed in their manual and
future automated states.

3Fiii. Improve current processes to introduce maker-checker (four eyes) controls where
appropriate (i.e. as with the GLO user enablement.- planned Fast Fix).

3li. Postmasters should be reminded of the importance of good governance of their
users and the process for mover/leaver notification should be reviewed.

3lii. Educate Branch owners and staff on the risks and impact of shared (borrowed) user
identities and logins.

3liii. Increase the frequency of user verification/inactivity to reduce the likelihood of
leaver/shared account misuse.

3Li. and 3Mi. As a part of POL's assurance process, it is recommended that
agreement is reached to test user cases which provide the greatest risk to Branch data.
Due to Fujitsu's concerns around the potential risks exposed in disclosing personally
identifiable information of its employees, this would need to be performed as a walk-
through against a scripted process with obfuscated logs as evidence.

3Mii. The 90-day window for inactivity should be reduced to a maximum of 21 days
after an account becomes dormant.

4.3.4 Compliance
There are two risk gradings in this section.

Serious In-scope area mapping Foundational

Observations and impact

4A. POL has a thorough approach to its Regulators and bodies it must comply
with such as the Link Network (ATM’s), though there is not sufficient
collaboration in planning, monitoring and oversight of Horizon/broader POL IT
compliance and risk management/3LoD.

It is noted that POL is the Appointed Representative (AR) of directly regulated
firms for the distribution of banking and insurance products. This does not
include banking framework services. This does not mean POL are regulated in
this space, thougI is accepted that demonstrating ‘compliance in spirit’ is
recommended and its Regulated providers should direct POL on how this should
be interpreted.

«Compliance is well managed at a business level. However, the interpretation of
requirements into IT/security controls is not sufficiently developed and therefore the
ability of POL to manage its associated risks, including POL's Internal Audit teams
ability to provide evidenced reporting is limited.

This is particularly relevant where POL is an AR of directly regulated firms i.e. its
third parties, where POL must satisfy the AR that they are ‘compliant in spirit’.
Without such, POL risk significant fines, damage to reputation and the possible
withdrawal of services from partners, all of which would lead to significant loss of
revenue and impact the sustainability of POL. This was confirmed during
discussions with POL representatives (3-Nov-2020 and March 2021).

Please see Section 4.4.7
IT Controls Framework.

Recommendation

4Ai. Compliance approaches should be embedded within the appropriate operating
models/frameworks — Risk, IT operations, Internal Audit, etc. including where POL relies
upon third party services.

4Aii. Review the IT risk management framework against identified and prioritised risks to
establish if compliance expectations are appropriately reflected.

4Aiii. Establish clear responsibilities and plans for appropriately authorised individuals
with pathways for escalation to leadership.

4.3.5 Test Governance
There are two risk gradings in this section.

Serious In-scope area mapping

Observations and impact

5A. A draft organisational Test Policy has been created and signed off by POL
and is now with the third parties for review. A draft test framework has been
created, and is under review with POL.

«The lack of a test policy was identified as a gap in KPMG's initial analysis in Q4
2020. An organisational test policy has since been produced. Once this is accepted
by the third party suppliers, this must be embedded across Horizon test delivery.

e — The test framework was also not in place; a draft framework is in the process of
being built and reviewed by POL.

e This was evidenced during discussions with POL representatives (2-Nov-2020) and
ATOS representatives (11-Nov-2020), and further sessions throughout Jan-21 and
Feb-21.

5B. Test Governance is fragmented and is applied inconsistently.

e — There is little or no POL test governance over internal and third party test delivery.
This leads to inconsistent quality, lack of coherent test outputs and delivery, and
ambiguous results which cannot be verified or relied upon. This was evidenced
during discussions with POL representatives (06-Nov-2020, 12-Nov-2020) and
ATOS representatives (11-Nov-2020).

e Discussions between POL and FJ have commenced to determine how this gap can
be resolved.

5C. Requirements traceability is incomplete or missing.

e Without clear traceability in place, it is difficult to determine if a requirement has
been designed, built, and then tested. This is evidenced by reviewing documents.
shared by ATOS representative (11-Nov-2020), and during discussions with POL
representatives (30-Nov-2020), and ongoing conversations throughout Feb 2021
and Mar 2021.

Recommendation

5Ai. Finalise and embed the organisation wide Test Policy across Horizon test delivery,
including third party test delivery.

SAii. Finalise and embed the test framework, which outlines and determines the
required test deliverables for each type of test engagement.

5Bi. Determine what is required to resolve the gaps, and agree to implement
appropriate and effective test governance to ensure that all testing follows and adheres
to POL's test framework.

5Ci. Traceability of requirements should be both mandatory and automated via an
appropriate tool.

Observations and impact

5D. Lack of a clearly defined test environment and test data strategy.

e — The pathway to live for change is unclear, and how code is applied to the test
environments appears to be inconsistent and uncontrolled. Whilst it is understood
what each test environment should be used for, there doesn't seem to be a
cohesive approach to managing the test environments.

« The management of test data does not appear to be a high priority, and test data
does not appear to be tightly controlled. The test data within the test environments.
is not kept up to date (i.e. reflective of Production), and does not seem to contain a
representative mix of data points.

e This is evidenced by review of the provided "Edge Fujitsu Test Environment

SDLC Governance
There are two risk gradings in this section.

In-scope area mapping

Observations and impact

6A. POL does not have a formal Programme or Project Software Delivery Lifecycle
(SDLC) methodology

e Whilst POL does have a formal Portfolio Management Process, it does not have a
standardised Project Management Lifecycle or a SDLC delivery methodology that
specifically outlines the delivery approach to be used, how the programme or
project will function, and how the change will be delivered by the programme or
project. The decision on which programme delivery methodology to use has been
delegated to the individual programmes or projects. The impact of this approach is
that no project will align in its approach, and each project will be structured
differently. This also increases the complexity of project governance, as each
project has different quality gates, milestones, delivery structures and ways of
managing third parties. This was evidenced during discussions with POL
representatives (29-Oct-2020, 2-Nov-2020, 3-Mar-2021).

Initial discussions have commenced between POL stakeholders as to what tooling
requirements are required to manage the SDLC lifecycle.

Recommendation

6Ai. Formalise and implement a standardised SDLC methodology which describes how
POL expects technical change delivery to occur. This methodology should adhere to
accepted universal standards of software delivery. Whilst third parties can, in their
responsible components, follow their own internal processes, once the change moves
under POL's control, the change should be governed under this standardised
methodology.

6B. Documents do not adhere to POL standard templates, and the quality of the
documents varies greatly. Sign-offs for documentation also vary.

e Without standardisation and appropriate quality standards in place, test
documentation is unreliable and may not contain required information.
Furthermore, POL is not obtaining a clear and precise understanding of any
ongoing testing. This is evidenced by review of the provided “Test Strategy R1”,
“CM-POL-IT Change Management Policy v1.0", “POA-TSR-DM0119468 -

Risk management authority

Rating High In-scope area mapping Foundational

Observations and impact

7A. POL’s approach to risk assessment and management is insufficient for a
business of its complexity and community importance.

Although Risk Registers exist at a central, project and technical level, these are
not sufficiently developed. Risks identified do not reflect the business priorities
and are poorly managed.

e — This inhibits the ability of POL's ISMF and management to advise, challenge and
respond to risks. This could lead to high-impact risks not being identified and open
risks not being addressed resulting in misalignment with POL's risk appetite,
exposing POL to potential regulatory criticism and future reputational damage. This
was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (3-Nov-2020) and
March 2021, and review of evidence provided (26-Nov-2020) “20201104 Security
Risk.xisx”.

Please also see Sections:
4.4.2 Risk management at Three Lines of Defence (3LoD),
4.4.7

IT Controls Framework, and

4.10.2 Business Continuity Plan (BCP) / Disaster Recovery (DR).

7B. POL is migrating from its Archer risk management framework tool to
ServiceNow as part of a platform consolidation process. It is building risk
registers to track monitor, identify dependencies, aggregate risks, and highlight
potential impact on the new platform, building a strategic risk management tool.
This is a positive step to platform consolidation.

e The migration needs to be built upon by POL's Horizon team to ensure the
shortcomings of the former Archer platform are not replicated, where only high-
level and generic risks were recorded, and little value was seen in the platform.
Successful implementation will enable an approach where controls, risks and
remediation are all managed through one platform enabling management of
internal controls to provide complete and accurate reporting metrics leading to
efficient and effective strategic and operational decisions being made by POL
leadership. This was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (3-
Nov-2020), subsequent discussions in March-21, and review of evidence provided
“20201104 Security Risk.xlsx” (26-Nov-2020).

Recommendation

7Ai. Risks should be evaluated and managed on the basis of the likelihood and impact
to the business.

Risk management at Three Lines of Defence (3LoD)

In-scope area mapping Foundational

Observations and impact

8A. POL The annual Service Organisation Controls Report ISAE3402 (SOCR)
obtained from Fujitsu reviews high level infrastructure controls and does not
provide reasonable assurance for Fujitsu managed controls over Horizon as the
report does not provide assurance over the design and operating effectiveness of
the controls.

We also noted that Internal Audit currently reviews the SOC report ISAE3402 informally.
See also 8B.

e Lack of assurance over the design and operating effectiveness of the controls
regarding Fujitsu managed controls in respect of Horizon can result in lack of
effective management of Fujitsu as a vendor, resulting in regulatory criticism,
potential fines, reputational damage and possible further litigation against POL (3-
Nov-2020, 5-Nov-2020 and 2 March 2021).

8B. Third LoD Internal Audit assurance activities are based on thematic reviews.

These reviews do not call out or specifically include assurance over controls

around Horizon which can result in a lack of risk management activities and

appropriately scoped reviews of in-house and outsourced controls around

Horizon.

e — This could result in, insufficient management of Fujitsu as a vendor, resulting in
regulatory criticism, potential fines, reputational damage, and possible further
litigation against POL. This was confirmed during discussions with POL
representatives (5-Nov-2020 and 2-March-2021).

Recommendation

8Ai. Internal Audit should formalise the reviews of the Service Organisation Controls
Report ISAE3402 (SOCR) obtained from Fujitsu and ensure the evidence of reviews are
retained for audit trail purpose. Any identified findings with potential risks to Horizon to
be included in Archer, second LoD to discuss with first LoD and formulate actions to be
taken and dealt with accordingly as a part of continual dialogue between first and
second LoD.

8Aii. Internal Audit should consider obtaining SOC 1 / SOC 2 reports from Fujitsu in
order to get comfort over the design and operating effectiveness of the controls.

8Bi. IA should review their strategy and approach and consider whether thematic
approach is adequate around Horizon and also consider revisiting the IT Controls
framework to ensure if it drills down to the granular level of applications.

8Bii. As part of the collaborated efforts between second and third LoD , third LoD to
continually monitor emerging risks regarding the Horizon estate and supporting
resources, conduct business monitoring, risk assessments and refresh audit plans
accordingly and formalise the communication with risk and 2nd LoD.

4.4.3 Contractual Arrangements

In-scope area mapping Foundational

Observations and impact

9A. The strategic IT vendor management process is performed on an ad-hoc basis
rather than at regular, set intervals. These ad-hoc reviews do not seem to have
the ability to apply the latest business needs or re-evaluation of the required
service levels against the contracts.

e This has caused significant gaps between business needs and vendor provided
services resulting in vendors not meeting with POL's expectations or needs to
deliver a service to its Postmasters and customers, and leading to contractual and
Horizon performance issues. This was confirmed during discussions with POL
representatives (29-Oct-2020 and subsequent discussions 29-Jan-2021, 24-Feb-
2021, 09-March-2021).

Recommendation

QAi. Determine the key issues and gaps within the service delivery, and address these
core issues within the vendor contract.

QAii. Implement POL process to assure and present challenge to Fujitsu and other
relevant vendors as a part of the revised operating model. It is recognised that the post
holder in the POL Horizon IT function is providing more challenge to Fujitsu, however
this will require more formality to ensure vendors provide what is required.

QAiii. Implement appropriate and required SLAs to ensure that Fujitsu meets POL's
expectations when delivering support service regarding Horizon. This will require
contractual re-negotiations between POL and Fujitsu to implement.

Product Management

Serious In-scope area mapping

Observations and impact

10A. Initially there was no Product Owner for Horizon; a Product Owner has now
been assigned (from Feb 21).

e Up until the appointment of the GLO-/IT director there was no single person
responsible for ownership and formalised coordination of the Horizon platform - i.e.
with responsibility across change, operations, strategic vision, business support,
etc.

« Updates are made based on requests by Business Product managers with limited
oversight from POL IT on sequencing and prioritisation.

e These items were evidenced by discussions with POL representatives (22-Oct-
2020 and 28-Oct-2020).

e A Product Owner has now been assigned, and is taking overarching ownership of
the platform.

10B. Level of involvement from architects is limited.

e Late or inadequate engagement of a Solution Architect have resulted in poor
documentation (including design documentation) thereby resulting in design
issues/gaps. This was evidenced by discussions with POL representatives (22-Oct-
2020).

e — Effort is now taking place to rectify this gap, and improve architect involvement.
Documentation is being reconstituted.

Recommenda'

10Ai. The Product Owner now needs to take formal ownership of the Horizon Platform,
with sign-off responsibility and accountability for change being delivered into the
platform.

10Aii. With the Product Owner assigned, the next main action is to develop a Product
Lifecycle for the Horizon platform.

10Bi. Mandate early and continuous engagement of enterprise and solution architects
for any change across Horizon.

Observations and impact

11A. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is used by support staff but its use is not
extensive, and consideration may be given to enhancing POL and Postmaster
staff authentication with its use. The current username and password approach
in a number of areas could be elevated as there is a concern regarding the
assurance of user identity and thus security.

e The current approach can allow the impersonation of users, compromising
auditability and security. This was confirmed during discussions with POL
representatives (19-Nov-2020, during Feb-21 and March-21).

11D. Though SMARTIDs are owned by POL employees, logon information

is shared via the Branch managers’ email addresses and password management

for Branch staff is solely administered by Branch managers.

e This is an exposure for franchise owners, Branch management, staff, and POL as
it provides Branch managers full access to Horizon IDs and SMARTIDs of their
entire Branch staff. This was confirmed during discussions with POL
representatives (19-Nov-2020 and 26th March 2021).

Please also see Governance 3! - User identification, access management and reporting.

Recommendation

11Aii. Consider enabling MFA for users where there is the potential for credential theft,
and assess the benefits for extending this to Branch user access.

11Di. A more thorough review of the current SmartID processes is recommended to
ensure any exposures to sharing of personal login data is limited and that it cannot be
subsequently exploited.

11Dii. Examine the feasibility of implementing maker checker (four eyes) controls
(manual or automated) for all Joiner Mover Leaver (JML) actions undertaken by
Postmasters.

11Diii. Assess the practicality of defining and implement segregation of duties
for elevated access roles such as Branch manager and implement if feasible.

11Div. Establish strong controls over Branch manager access. Ensure adequate
logging, monitoring, and reviewing is enabled.

Observations and impact

11B. Joiner Mover Leaver (JML) process for SMARTID/Branch login is
insufficiently governed by Postmasters and POL with leavers in particular not
being well managed and leaver detection largely based on inactivity.

e There is a lack of in-house POL controls or oversight on creation and use of Branch
staff accounts. This was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives
(17-Nov-2020).

e Dormant SmartID account policy is not efficient, based upon a 60 — 90 days'
inactivity window. This was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives
(17-Nov-2020 and further discussions in March and April 2021).

11C. It is known that inactive SMARTIDs are actively transacting.

e — The current SmartID process has known gaps, though the overall process enables
POL to tie an individual's National Insurance number to a user account, and
prevent multiple simultaneous logins with the SmartID.

e However, it does not provide adequate governance and control for the POL
or managers to be able to assert and prove that only duly authorised individuals
obtain appropriate access. This was confirmed by review of email received from
POL representatives (21-Nov-2020) “RE: Document Evidence Request for POL -
20Nov2020_v0.2.xIsx ”.

11E. For the staff of a Post Office. leavers' accounts remain available and are

“useful” where staff replacements are waiting for their own accounts.

e — This could breach staff contracts or referenced policies on appropriate use, if these
are in place, allowing staff who have not passed mandatory training to access
Horizon and is likely to breach centrally developed policies, irrespective of whether
these are communicated appropriately to Postmasters and their employees/staff.
This was confirmed by review of email “Document Evidence Request for POL -
20Nov2020_v0.2.xlsx” provided by POL representatives (21-Nov-2020,10:31) and
in subsequent conversations in March and April 2021.

Recommendatio:

11Bi. JML processes for SMARTID must be defined, periodically reviewed, and updated
as necessary.

11Bii. Immediate termination of leavers is recommended for SMARTIDs as they provide
critical access to Horizon and Branch hub.

11Biii. Assess current operations and identify opportunities for automation to improve
efficiency and reduce human error.

11Biv. Consideration should be given to the practicality of an interim solution using, say
Branch Hub, to raise tickets for leavers.

11C. Refer to 11Bii.

Observations and impact

11F. Post-Covid, two POL staff members can create, amend, and delete GLO
Branch users and the setup does not have a four-eyes (maker-checker) approach
to protect the individual and POL as a good governance process.

«The lack of process assurance for user setup exposes the unobserved and un-
checked actions of the operatives to future examination and is a risk exposure for
POL which could be easily resolved with an improved maker-checker process. This
was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (17-Nov-2020 and
during March and April 2021) and email received (18-Nov-2020) “FW: Post Office
Limited Horizon discussions - follow up check”.

Please see Section 4.3.3

Recommendation

11Fi. Implement a maker-checker (four-eyes) process as an interim solution as part of
Fast Fix.

11Fii. If staff move back to an office-based environment re-examine the process to
maintain the proposed four eyes approach.

11H. The process of creation, validation (certification) and revocation appears to
be well documented and managed, based upon the information provided.
Workflows have been provided to illustrate creation, approval, revalidation, and
activity monitoring within the Fujitsu Europe Business Management System.
Although these processes are manual, as described, they appear to be repeatable
and documented, providing a level of assurance over them having some degree
of maturity.

e Whilst the process appears well-documented and managed, the lack of process
automation relies upon human diligence for check-in-check-out, password rotation
and limited time usage, thus errors can occur. This was confirmed during written
exchanges with Fujitsu referred to at Appendix 1: Documentation although KPMG.
has been unable to test this with Fujitsu.

111. The primary HZ user store is the Fujitsu AD system which controls and

defines all access and connectivity controls. These include the mandating of

multi factor authentication for remote access and appropriate role limitations in
order to preserve appropriate segregations of duty. Rules are well documented.

Unix, Oracle, and Windows platforms plus the service databases (Oracle and
SQL) have administrative staff assigned to them. These assignments (roles) are
controlled by AD-driven groups (also termed “teams” by Fujitsu) within the
Fujitsu HZ domain. Access management is based upon documented rules and
role models and appear to be well designed and appropriately maintained for
what is a primarily manually managed approach. The access controls afforded by
user group membership are further managed on a use-case basis, such as user
access to a location or device.

« KPMG has been unable to test the provided accessibility matrix to ensure there are
no technical or procedural gaps in the controls.

e The use of manual controls is an exposure and with no automation there is no
likelihood of prevention or alerting for bad actors. This was confirmed during
written exchanges with Fujitsu referred to at Appendix 1: Documentation although
KPMG has been unable to test this with Fujitsu.

Recommendation

11Hi. The practicality of investment in a privileged access management (PAM) tool
seems low within the current contractual arrangement and lifecycle of the Horizon
platform. If this is the case, consideration should be given to improvements in reporting
and POL IA assessments to partially alleviate the lack of automation and improve POL's
visibility of process.

11li. As a part of the POL risk management and assurance process it is recommended
that agreement is reached to test use cases which provide the greatest risk to Branch
data. Due to concerns around the potential for disclosure or misuse of personally
identifiable information raised by Fujitsu on behalf of its employees, this would need to
be performed as a walk-through against a scripted process with obfuscated logs as
evidence.

11J. A role known as APPSUP is used for non-balance impacting actions, such as
stock unit associations, month end rollovers, or monthly tidying of dispatch

systems. This is subject to an approval process which includes both POL and
Fujitsu managers and is currently being improved and documented to create a
clear, evidence pack from request to completion within the Fast Fix programme.

e The process and changes being enacted are critical to evidencing agreed changes,
which if unapproved may be deemed to be to the Postmaster’s detriment. The
approach will demonstrate POL has provided appropriate oversight with a
consequence that the audit trail is operationally complete. This was confirmed

IT Controls Framework

In-scope area mapping Foundational

Observations and impact

12A. Work has started to address the scope and granularity of the IT Controls and
framework which is not implemented in a way which enables a meaningful and
granular view, thus the controls framework does not actually apply robust and
effective controls to IT processes across delivery, operations, change
management and vendor management. The initial work covers 15 prioritised
Horizon-orientated elements as a start-point for a more extensive programme and
incorporates COBIT and NIST-based control points.

e — The lack of an efficient IT Controls Framework, supported by a clear identification
of IT risks and a similarly risk-based POL Internal Audit process could hinder
management's ability to identify and address issues relating to functioning of
internal controls, thereby resulting in delayed improper decision making which
could potentially affect company's brand or reputation. This was confirmed during
discussions with POL representatives (10-Nov-2020, subsequent discussions in
March and April 2021) and a subsequent review of the extracted controls “Copy of
Risk and Control Matrix.xlsx”.

e Investigations and rectification efforts have now commenced.

Recommendation

12Ai. Update and extend the IT controls framework to include the required relevant
control processes, documentation, and objective control descriptions to implement
effective controls across the IT landscape within POL, including vendor supported
applications. Design the controls accordingly to ensure the controls are granular, well
understood by the staff performing Control Self Assessments (CSA), and are applicable
to POL.

12Aii. Once the IT Controls framework is matured, POL IA should update its process to
perform independent and periodic Internal Audits.

12Aiii. Finalise In—Scope Controls and periodically review the controls to ensure their
relevancy is maintained. i.e. any aged or duplicate controls should be updated and/or
removed.

12Aiv. Enhance the IT Control reporting schedules, and ensure the reporting contains
the required information to accurately determine the effectiveness and completeness of
the controls.

12Av. Develop and implement the Controls Process Management document, and
ensure adherence.

449 Testing
There are two risk gradings in this section.

In-scope area mapping

Observations and impact

13A. POL does not perform appropriate or comprehensive User Acceptance
Testing.

e Without appropriate UAT being performed there is no user validation of the change.
Postmasters do not have exposure to the change until after it goes into Production,
so there is little chance for them to comment or examine the change in detail prior
to being forced to use it. This was evidenced during discussions with ATOS.
representatives (11-Nov-2020 and 8-Dec-2020) and POL representatives (30-Nov-
2020).

« Discussions have commenced to determine how this issue will be resolved. No key
decisions have been finalised at this point.

e Investigations regarding the usage of the Model Office environment to support UAT
effort are underway; however, the Model Office environment is part of the
Production infrastructure, and as such there are limitations to what testing can
actually be performed in this environment.

13B. The test environments are not properly managed and utilised, with single

environments in use by multiple projects and test phases. Test data within the

environments is not refreshed.

e Conducting multiple test phases which have different test objectives in the same
environment will result in environment conflict (e.g. different batches being run at
the same time and on the same environment).

e Using obsolete test data can result in code conflicts, data issues and other code
configuration issues which could invalidate certain test results.

e Additionally, test analysts from different teams could attempt to use the same test
data resulting in data conflicts.

e — This is evidenced by review of the provided "Edge Fujitsu Test Environment
Review Report v1.1” and during discussions with ATOS representatives (11-Nov-
2020, 8-Dec-2020).

e This has further been expanded upon via conversations with the Fujitsu test
manager (2-Mar-20210, where it was noted that POL only has access to one test
Horizon environment. This is also detailed in the “COMMGTREP4166v1.0 -
TESTING-QA’ report supplied by Fujitsu (1-Feb-2021).

13E. There is no end-to-end regression in place, and the Horizon regression

testing is performed in an ad hoc and unplanned manner. There is no

coordination of regression testing across POL, Fujitsu and ATOS, and when
regression testing is executed, it is restricted only to the area of responsibility of
the third party (i.e. Fujitsu will only regression test Horizon at the system test
level, ATOS rarely execute regression at all). Fujitsu does have a regression suite
of tests; however, these are only executed as part of a project, and they are not
executed independently.

Recommenda'

13Ai. A UAT phase should be Introduced as standard for all Horizon change. UAT
should be conducted within its own non-Production environment, post the completion of
functional testing.

13Bi. Testing for each project should be carried out in dedicated environments with
different data sets. The phases should be conducted sequentially (ST first, then SIT
followed by UAT) and with robust entry and exit stage gates between these test phases.

13Ei. Establish an appropriate regression approach which covers the end-to-end
business processes, as well as integration and functional components. Expand the
regression suite to cover all required functionality which requires regular regression.
This regression approach should include a regular (monthly) execution cycle for the
regression suite.

13C. POL does not have an owner for Non-Functional Testing (NFT), and there is
no overarching NFT approach.

e The lack of POL ownership means that the third party vendors make their own
decisions on NFT, which can leave POL exposed to risk. Additionally, without a
POL NFT SME in place, validation, and acceptance of NFT results is incorrectly
delegated to the third parties; there is a risk that the required level of quality will not
be met, and there is no independent validation of the results. This was evidenced
during discussions with ATOS representatives (11-Nov-2020).

13D. POL do not have a standard set of Non-Functional requirements (NFRs)

covering the Horizon platform.

e  Non-functional aspects of the system cannot be designed, built, and tested
adequately thereby providing limited/no confidence around system robustness,
performance, integrity, and security. This was evidenced during discussions with
ATOS representatives (11-Nov-2020).

Recommendation

13Ci. POL to identify a NFT subject matter expert (SME) to take ownership of all non-
functional testing, and govern third party delivery of NFT.

4.4.10 Change management
There are two risk gradings in this section.

Serious In-scope area mapping

Observations and impact

14A. KPMG initial analysis identified that the POL change control process was
immature and had gaps; POL has updated and improved the process across Q1
2021.

e Not all change was governed by the change control process; some change was
previously redirected to project work, some was not seen until after the change is
implemented, some change did occur without passing through this process.

e Due to the lack of a structured and formal framework, many of the decisions within
the change management process are made subjectively and without consultation.
A formal framework is now being developed, and is Work in Progress.

e Horizon change can come via non-IT projects; this change is sometimes unknown
and does not pass through the change control process. This has now been
updated, and all change is expected to be controlled by the change control
process.

e This has been recognised as a core area which requires rectification, and a new
change delivery process is being implemented, with the aim of drastically improving
change management.

e This is evidenced by review of the provided “20200907 Horizon Governance Terms
of Reference v1.0” and “CM-POL-IT Change Management Policy v1.0” and during
discussions with POL representatives (27-Oct-2020, 14-Jan-2021, 9-Feb-2021, 20-
Apr-2021).

14B. Impact assessments of Horizon changes are irregular and inconsistent.

e Inadequate impact assessments carry the risk that the impact of the change is not
fully understood, and the change can have a more dramatic impact than expected.

e Discussions are ongoing between POL and the third party suppliers on how this
gap can be resolved.

* This was evidenced during discussions with POL representatives (27-Oct-2020, 30-
Nov-2020), and there have been additional discussions in Mar 2021.

14D. The Design Authority is being re-implemented and re-established.

e The Design Authority was deprecated when the architectural capability was
outsourced to ATOS (2014).

e Actions are being taken to re-constitute the Design Authority, with the appropriate
terms of reference in place.

e Without a Design Authority in place to oversee changes or ensure they are
consistent with Post Office Limited strategy, compliance or data governance,
change can occur without oversight and appropriate review.

e This is evidenced by review of the provided ‘Current Architecture and Forums.ppt’
and during discussions with POL representatives (14-Dec-2020), and ongoing
discussions in Q1 2021.

Observations and impact

14C. The documentation provided by the third parties into the change process are
limited, and do not adequately describe the change or the impact of the change.
These documents are not appropriately challenged by POL.

e Without clear and concise details, the full scope of the change cannot be
understood, and there is a risk that the impact of the change may be wider than
originally thought. Additionally, without clear challenge there is no incentive for the
third parties to provide more in-depth and accurate information.

e _ As part of the update and improvement to the change management process, the
deliverables from third parties will be reviewed, and uplifted as required.
Discussions with the third parties have commenced.

e This is evidenced by review of the provided “20200907 Horizon Governance Terms
of Reference v1.0" and “CM-POL-IT Change Management Policy v1.0", during
discussions with POL representatives (27-Oct-2020), and in ongoing discussions
with POL throughout Q1 2021.

14. There is no central change repository, which holds records of all change

(historic and on-going).

«Changes, particularly to reference data and AP-ADC scripts, are not always
persisted in a centralised repository which would allow oversight of change history
and dependency management. Without this record in place, POL cannot determine
the historical profile of change being applied to Horizon, or effectively analyse the
impact of change to Horizon.

e As the Change Management process is updated and matured, Service Now will
become the repository for change, containing the required change records.

e This was evidenced during discussions with ATOS representatives (7-Dec-2020)

4.4.11 Known Error Logs (Historic)

In-scope area mapping KEL (historic)

Observations and impact

15A. Historic KELs documentation lacks adequate details (particularly technical
details regarding the issue, the cause and how it was resolved). This has since
been rectified, with technical details now supplied by Fujitsu.

e Without adequate details supplied, there is uncertainty and lack of a consistent
means of confirmation regarding whether or not the historic KEL has actually been
resolved and is no longer impacting the Horizon platform.

e — This is evidenced by review of the provided “Horizon Known Error Review ToR V1”
and during discussions with POL representatives (06-Nov-2020, 19-Nov-2020).

e With the submission of the Historic BEDs report “COMMGTREP4169 BED Report
v1.0" (23-Feb-2021), and the ongoing technical workshops, substantial progress
has been made by POL to resolving the Historic KELs, with 45 of the 62 now
closed, and the remaining are to be tested. Further progress is being made with
respect to the testing of the outstanding KELs, with Fujitsu and POL working
together collaboratively to plan the testing.

Recommendation

15Ai. Continue with the current effort to close out these Historic KELs.

Capability

The following pages detail our observations as they pertain to Horizon capability.

POL Horizon capabilities

SDLC
Foundational

Serious In-scope area mapping

Observations and impact

146A. The Horizon IT function has grown to 20+ experienced technical delivery
individuals, with the objective of ensuring that POL has the capability to both
govern and deliver change into Horizon, as well as fully understand the platform
from a technical sense.

There remains a heavy reliance upon a number of vendors to manage Horizon, as
the team still has capability gaps to fill (e.g. BAs, development, release).

e — There are still key person dependences in place, where a single SME has.
knowledge of a specific component or process (e.g. AP-ADC scripts and Reference
Data). There is a risk that if this SME is “lost” then the knowledge is likewise lost.

e There are still overarching gaps in the HMR's team's knowledge, especially
considering the depreciation of POL technical documentation and knowledge since
the ATOS outsource in 2014. Whilst this is being recovered and rectified, the scale
and scope of effort is large, and will require an extended period of time to resolve.

e — This was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (16-Oct-2020, 29-
Oct-2020 and 11-Nov-2020), with additional discussions throughout Q1 2021.

Recommendation

16Ai. Implement and embed the newly designed and launched target operating model
for Horizon, and ensure this is supported by a complementary model in the broader
organisation and by the vendors.

16Aii. Where capabilities are lacking, consider hiring or contracting the required
capabilities to design and assure Horizon processes and testing, noting that good
practice dictates these as separate functions.

16Aiii. The need for improvement in skills and capabilities is one which needs to be
addressed corporately as a part of the POL's strategy, feeding down into the various
business areas, such as Horizon.

16Aiv. The POL strategy for change should drive a training and development
programme for POL Horizon associated staff and those who will be relied upon to
support Horizon in the wider POL business.

Culture and product

The following pages detail our observations as they pertain to Horizon culture
and conduct.

Culture and understanding around roles and responsibilities

Foundational

Serious In-scope area mapping

Rating

Observations and impact

17A. In our initial investigation we observed that there was an apparent lack of
defined, understood or acknowledged job roles, impacting upon incumbents’
understanding of responsibilities and accountabilities in relation to Horizon.

The new Horizon Operating Model has defined roles and responsibilities and
individuals have been appointed to these roles.

The culture that is being embedded within the Horizon team needs to be
supported by a broader shift in culture POL-wide.

e The previous lack of a Horizon-orientated Operating Model and lack of
understanding referred to above impacted the timeliness and effectiveness of
POL's reaction to the Horizon Issues. POL stakeholders have observed that POL
has had an insufficiently collaborative and questioning culture. This has been
especially noticeable regarding implementing change to react to the Horizon
Issues. This is confirmed by discussions with POL representatives (21-Oct-2020,
23-Oct-2020, 29-Oct-2020, 30-Oct-2020, 3-Nov-2020 and 10-Nov-2020, and
subsequent discussions in January to April 2021).

17B. A new Target Operating Model (TOM) has been introduced which includes

roles and responsibilities. Historically there has been a lack of knowledge to

challenge vendors within supplier relationship, thus vendors have not been held
to account and performance reporting has been misaligned. Incumbents will need
to manage vendors at a relationship, performance and contract basis within their
new roles and be confident in the support of their stakeholders.

e Vendors will continue to act or revert to a status quo unless the TOM is fully
adopted and sustained. SLAs and lines of communication within a model that
protects POL's interests and hold vendors to account must be agreed and
enforced. This is confirmed by discussions with POL representatives during
October and November 23-Oct-2020, 29-Oct-2020, 30-Oct-2020, 3-Nov-2020, 10-
Nov-2020 and subsequent discussions including 09-Mar-2021).

Recommendation

17Ai. All component workstreams that support the target Operating model and are
illustrated at Appendix 5: Short-term Fast Fix tactical remediation (Fast Fix) and
Appendix 6: Long-term remediation planning (Long Term Remediation) need to be
aligned with those of the Postmaster Journey and underpinned by POL's Culture and
Change programme to deliver and sustain the required outcomes, and building for the
Strategic Platform Modernisation.

with POL representatives (16-Oct-2020 and 12-Nov-2020)."

Recommendation

18Ai. Continue to completion the PCI compliance in-flight project.
18Aii. Add PCI DSS non-compliance to the Central, Project and Technical Risk

Rating Serious In-scope area mapping Foundational

Observations and impact

19A. Migration to AWS as part of the Belfast Exit is in-flight however POL still

have a significant number of decisions to make (i.e. whether to stay with Fujitsu
to manage Horizon or not, integration or migration of legacy product services
onto AWS).

Since this observation was originally made in Nov 2020, there has been a great
deal of movement with Belfast Exit, however there are still some core decisions
which will impact Horizon yet to be finalised (for example - how will the test
environments function, what will be done with the applications not being migrated
to AWS, what happens with the applications now they are in AWS (refactor /
rebuild / improve), etc.).

e Not remediating the identified findings from the current environment in Belfast
datacentre could lead to future Horizon operational issues with potential cost
implications. This was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (29-
Oct-2020 and 5-Nov-2020).

Recommendation

19Ai. Review interdependencies and the core contracts surrounding the migration to
ensure no potential conflicts or future complications materialise.

19Aii. Ensure that the current POL - Fujitsu contract is fit for purpose to accommodate
the in-flight migration and future states.

Supplier and performance management

The following pages detail our observations as they pertain to Horizon supplier
and performance management.

Vendor performance management
There are two risk gradings in this section.

In-scope area mapping Foundational

Observations and impact

20A. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are too high-level, without well-defined
service performance metrics, which is self-reported by Fujitsu and no subsequent
independent assurance activities being undertaken by POL. It should be noted
that there is currently no contractual obligation for detailed reporting.

e High-level and non-accountable performance reviews do not provide sufficient
evidence of vendors’ performance to the required standards, with no improvement
expectations from stakeholders. This leads to the Service Management Report
(SMR) being accepted as is with no challenge from POL.

e — The results of the metrics from the Fujitsu provided SMR do not include sufficient
technical analysis regarding any issues or problems which had arisen during the
reported month.

e Lack of overall visibility and governance of the Horizon service, which could lead to
performance metrics not being met and result in operational issues.

This was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (29-Oct-2020 and
9-Nov-2020, and ongoing discussions in February and March 2021) with
subsequent review of the provided Service Management Report “SMR Pack -
September 2020”.

Recommendation

20Ai. Develop service performance management frameworks for the current and

future target operating models. Ensure there is inclusion of relevant forum(s) with Fujitsu
presence for POL to discuss and present relevant challenges on reported metrics in
order to maximise service performance for Horizon.

20Aii. Review and update the defined expected KPls and thresholds to meet with POL
defined Horizon risk appetite. This will require contractual re-negotiations between POL
and Fujitsu to implement.

20Aiii. In parallel with 20Aii, working in collaboration with Fujitsu, revise the SMR to
include relevant and detailed technical analysis to ensure that POL is made aware of
Horizon related issues and problems that are being or have been resolved.

20Aiv. In the short-term, POL should be seen to be consuming and acting upon the
requested inputs from Fujitsu and other key vendors to demonstrate the
importance/value of the requested improvements.

20Av. Stakeholders should be engaged in discussions regarding investments required
to achieve the outputs desired from vendors and such decisions formally agreed.

Observations and impact

20B. Horizon service performance is overseen through different governance
routes such as the Information Security Management Forum (ISMF) and Service

e This drives a fragmented view of supplier performance leading to potential
inaccurate or incomplete metrics used by POL leadership to manage the vendors

4.10 Technology

The following pages detail our observations as they pertain to Horizon
technology.

4.10.1 Tool support for change delivery

Rating Serious In-scope area mapping SDLC

Observations and impact

21A. There is no universally required project management tooling in place, and
some projects are managed via spreadsheets and email, whereas other projects
are using an implementation of Jira just for the delivery of that project.

e There seems to be no overarching tool in place to facilitate the delivery of a) project
change or b) test management, which causes inefficient control and coordination of
change management. Similarly, there is no coordination of metrics, MI, and
reporting, and so the governance of each project will be different, and more
complex, than if there was a prescribed tool which had to be used for project
management.

« This is evidenced by review of the provided "Test Strategy R1”, “POA-TPN-2415 -
PCI DSS Test Plan v0.2”, “PCI DSS - Master Test Strategy v1.0” and during
discussions with POL representatives (11-Nov-2020, 12-Nov-2020).

Recommendati

21Ai. Whilst POL has IBM DOORS and Microfocus ALM present, these tools have not
been in use several years, and have degraded. Re-licensing may be expensive, and
these tools may no longer suit POL's approach. A suitability assessment of the current
market available tools should be conducted, and the most appropriate tools
implemented - and their use enforced across all change.

Observations and impact

e The BCP document is high level, and outlines the purpose and scope of the
required business continuity approach, and this is as expected, and is acceptable.
However, the next level of detail, which should be contained in the business

to determine how business continuity will be handled. This was evidenced by
conversations with the BCP manager and the DR manager (3-Mar-2021, 15-Apr-
2021, 16-Apr-2021).

22B. There is no consideration for resilience at the architectural level.

e Designing for business and technical resilience is not included in the architectural
effort of change. This has an impact of making resilience an afterthought, and the
solution (when implemented) may not have the required components in place to
support the expected resilience requirements. This was evidenced by
conversations with the BCP manager and the DR manager (3-Mar-2021, 15-Apr-
2021, 16-Apr-2021).

22C. POL has no Business Impact Assessments (BIA) in place. BIAs are a

standard component of a BCP, and inform the overall BCP approach and

structure.

e Without BIAs in place, the business cannot determine what the business and
financial impacts are when a system goes offline for a period of time. BIAs also
help determine the prioritisation for each system, enabling appropriate recovery
planning to be put in place. This was evidenced by conversations with the BCP.

22D. There is no clear linkage between the BCP approach and the DR approach

are maintained, however this is not the case, and the two areas are currently
operating independently. This is known to the BCP and DR leads, and they have
identified this as a risk, and are working to resolve this problem. This was
evidenced by conversations with the BCP manager and the DR manager (3-Mar-
2021, 15-Apr-2021, 16-Apr-2021).
22E. The DR approach is to repeat the same tests year on year, with no updates

22Bi. POL should develop a standardised and universally accepted approach to
resilience, which is well documented and applies across third party delivery. This will
ensure that third parties, when delivering solutions into POL, have to adhere to common
and understood resilience requirements.

22Bii. Include the resilience requirements in the architecture and design of a solution
(generally these are part of the non-functional requirements). This should include a
review by the BCP and DR managers.

22Ci. The BIAs need to be created, validated, and signed off as soon as possible. Once
complete, and accepted, the BIAs can then drive the BCP and DR strategy across POL
and the third parties.

22Di. The BCP and DR approaches need to work in conjunction, and in support of each
other. This is a goal of both the BCP and DR managers, and they are actively working
towards establishing a proper working structure.

22Ei. The DR testing has to consider system and structural change, adapting to reflect
what those changes were, and how they could potentially change the resilience of the
landscape.

22Eii. The tests being executed for DR year on year should be updated to reflect points
of failure, changes to the risk profile, changes to scope and changes to responsibilities

4.10.4 AP-ADC Scripts allow uncontrolled change

In-scope area mapping

Observations and impact

24A. Automated Payments — Advance Data Scripts (AP-ADC) are used to make
changes in Production & Reference Data.

e  Aninitial review of the function and use of the AP-ADC scripts has illustrated the
extent to which they represent a significant part of the HZ environment. Moreover,
their existence is shown to compromise DR, as the DR approach does not consider
AP-ADC changes which have been implemented, and the DR environments do not
always include the latest AP-ADC changes. Additionally, changes implemented via
AP-ADC are generally not tested from a holistic or an end-to-end perspective.
When the scripts have an impact wider than expected this may be missed until the
script is in Production, and then problems may occur. Note that the AP-ADC
scripting capability was originally the responsibility of POL; this function was then
outsourced to ATOS in 2014. Recently (April 2021), this functionality was insourced
back into POL from ATOS.

e — This was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (14-Dec-2020)
with subsequent review of the provided ‘AP-ADC script reference manual’
(20Nov2020).

e  Aseparate report focusing on AP-ADC scripts has been produced which provides a

4.10.5 Usability and User Interface Design

Serious In-scope area mapping

Observations and impact

25A. Usability is not considered during solution design, and there does not
appear to be a clear focus on the interface design and structure.

« Modern payment and retail systems have a focus on smooth and intuitive screen
design that supports the user journeys and process flows, whereas this does not
seem to be the case with Horizon. The screen interface has an “old school
terminal” feel which is complex and confusing, and still has elements which are no
longer part of the POL product offering. In a worst case scenario, poor screen
design can lead to user confusion and error, which then require backend
rectification and assistance to be provided to the user.

e This was confirmed during discussions with POL representatives (4-Feb-2021), and
with a subsequent review of the provided user interface design tools.

25Ai. Implement appropriate user design, following standard usability protocols. Tidy up
the screens and improve the user interaction with the platform.

We note the inclusion of the following workstreams in the Horizon Improvements

Programme (see Appendix 6: Long-term remediation planning). We would expect

our recommendations to be addressed across these workstreams:

Further observations

Observations have also been made during our review of the Horizon architecture.
It is our understanding that these observations are being addressed by current
POL activities. However, as they have the potential to cause problems which
align with the concerns of the Horizon Judgement, we have included them for
awareness, and they may have an impact on the Horizon Remediation
Programme or potentially the wider POL organisation. This list is not exhaustive.

“Non recoverable” or “lost” transaction types

It is possible, in the current architecture, to begin the process of buying a product
and then to exit from the process before payment is attempted. The fact that this
process was initiated, and a basket created, is not captured, or persisted
(generally) until such time as the process is completed by making a payment.
This means that certain products can be allocated and provided without there
ever being a record that this was done. This feature of the architecture allows
various undocumented workarounds and has potential to be a vector for
fraudulent transactions. There are several strands of remediation which will aim
to address this.

Branch workarounds

There are various mechanisms within the Horizon platform that facilitate
variations in the way Postmasters use the platform depending on their particular
business situation. For example; where a Postmaster operates a retail shop and
a Post Office but no separate EPOS system for their non-Post Office Limited
business, Postmasters may feel the need to use workarounds such as stamp
reversals to allow them to use the Horizon platform and payments mechanisms to
pay for stock items not supplied by the Post Office Limited for the sake of
supplying a convenient single payment point for their shop customers. These
processes and working practices have a high degree of risk associated since
errors and accounting mistakes can easily be made and there are some
variations on how these facilities are used. This observation has been taken
forward by GLO into the Postmaster engagement workstream.

Enfranchisement

There are various mechanisms within the Horizon platform that facilitate
variations in the way Postmasters use the platform depending on their particular
business situation. For example; where a Postmaster operates a retail shop and
a Post Office but no separate EPOS system for their non-Post Office Limited
business, Postmasters may feel the need to use workarounds such as stamp
reversals to allow them to use the Horizon platform and payments mechanisms to
pay for stock items not supplied by the Post Office Limited for the sake of
