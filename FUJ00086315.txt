Gareth,

I just remembered that I said I would send you some background information on this problem that we can hopefully discuss on Monday

Most of the info we have is on the PEAK, but in summary:

Martin can see evidence of two different types of failure. Firstly a failure of a Message Port to alert counter code when a new
transaction has been inserted into message store. And secondly a Riposte query failing. My suspicion is that something (and I think
we have now eliminated archiving because there is no trace in the Event Log) is hogging CPU time and the Riposte errors are a
secondary affect. There is some evidence for this because at about the time of the second failure, BUSY.EXE has logged an event,
which it does when there is a sudden change in system resources (I am not sure exactly what but guess CPU usage is a factor). Also
the trace times indicate that the query is taking approx 2x as long.

Needless to say this problem(s) cannot be reproduced at will.
We have run out of ideas on this one so any thoughts appreciated.

Regards,
Mark
