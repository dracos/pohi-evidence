Impact statements must consider all transitional states between Horizon and HNG-X, as well
as the final HNG-X solution.

Description of Change Proposed:

The Audit system supports a service (the Prosecution Support Service) whereby POL can request an
extract of historical data that is held within the Audit archive. Typically this requires retrieval of
archived Riposte transaction data. The data, as returned to POL, is often used to support legal
proceedings where, say, a postmaster is accused of fraud. In such cases, we must also provide a
witness statement with the audit data which attests to its provenance and integrity.

In order to further automate this service under HNG-X, for every branch Riposte data retrieval, the
archived events generated by counters at the branch are also analysed to identify any possible
occurrences of problems which might adversely affect the integrity of the transaction data.

The current Horizon tactical solution is a largely manual process, the operation of which is reliant on a
few key individuals. Whilst we believe that we will have to live with this tactical solution for the
remaining life of the Horizon Audit system, a permanent solution for the HNG-X Audit solution is
required. In outline, this will require the following:

Amending the HNG-X Audit server (ARC) and workstation (AUW) applications to automatically
retrieve and filter Events data when performing Horizon branch data retrievals."

Amending the HNG-X Audit server (ARC) and workstation (AUW) applications to automatically
retrieve and filter Events data when performing HNG-X branch data retrievals.”

Introduce Prosecution Support process changes around the operation of the amended system.

Identify suitable skilled & committed resources to perform any manual analysis required.
Identify all ongoing operational costs associated with operating the revised service.

Acceptance Criteria and Methods (Functional and Non Functional):
Testing will be required to ensure that all counter events are extracted by the system and presented to
the Audit workstation user for further analysis

Reason for Change and Justification for Required Date (above):

While we do not believe that (due to time constraints) it is practicable to introduce this change into
Horizon, it is required to ensure the viability of the ongoing Prosecution Support service within HNG-
x.

Consequences if Not Approved:

We are obliged to present, and vouch for the integrity of, Audit data that is-fitforpurpese- meets
the contractual requirements (amended at CCB 31/03/09) - i.e. admissible as evidence in
court. If this change is not approved, we will need to continue operating the current Horizon
tactical process for the lifetime of HNG-X.

This solution has a number of deficiencies :

It is a largely manual process which is error prone & time consuming.

It involves moving large volumes of data between the Audit server and workstation

It is reliant on ad hoc tooling & hardware

It is reliant on a few key individuals

It requires local & insecure storage of event audit data, invalidating certain statements made
within the current witness statement

It has no DR mechanism in the event of DR from BRAO1 to LEW02

? While there is no reason to believe that the HNG-X counter will suffer the same deficiencies as the Horizon
counter, it is advisable that similar checks are performed in both environments

Action Number: 2 Date Mar 24 2009 16:53:41 By: Ken.Westfield

Comments

Update from D Hinde regarding Audit Team and impact:

The development impact on this CP was based on retaining a contractor, starting work at the beginning of April
and delivering before end June 2009. This CP urgently needs to progress through the boards for approval if we

are to achieve this.

If approval of this CP is delayed the development impact is likely to increase as we will need to retain the
contractor beyond the end of June or find less skilled resource who will take longer to do the work.

Action Number: 3 Date Mar 26 2009 13:01:39 By: Ken. Westfield

PCCB Minutes (586) 26-Mar-09
CCB_PENDING

CP presented to PCCB by D Hinde on behalf of CS Security.

CP had been fully impacted and based on a delivery from Dev at the end of June, LST would test this after that
This was for a piece of work primarily within the Dev Audit team which the Account had identified as a must-
have. D Hinde confirmed that he had discussed this with W Warham who had agreed that CS would cover the

cost of this work. D Hinde and G Allen stressed the urgency in progressing the CP was that the identified
resource to do the work was due to leave next week.

ChM advised that the only o/s issue was for an impact from CS RM, but that had been delivered before the
PCCB and the paperwork had now been updated.

PCCB had no further comments and set to CCB Pending.

S Denham identified that this was currently being performed by a series of people using manual processes, with
the inherent risk to data integrity and was of the order of 9mds a month. G Wilkerson queried the savings on this
and after discussion S Denham identified that this change was to introduce automation to bring us back to a
baseline position.

W Warham requested S Denham take an action to include this in the CS Forecast for April and S Denham
agreed to do this.

Over and above that W Warham stressed that this was needed for accreditation and for acceptance into service as
reducing litigation risk and improving data integrity and confidence in the records.

R Wright asked when this was expected to be delivered and D Hinde stated that this was towards the end of June
(i.e. post Pilot).

G Wilkerson identified that the CP contained the words d€ceis fit for purposea€ and stated that this statement
should not be used, even on internal documents and P Sewell accepted an action to amend this.

CCB had no further comment and approved the CP.

Actions:

1. S Denham to include the mds are included in the CS Forecast for April.

2. P Sewell to amend words in the CP from a€cea€ if fit for purposea€ to 4€cemeets the contractual
requirementsa€

P.M.N. CP wording updated by P Sewell and ChM to reflect the request made at CCB, Action complete.
