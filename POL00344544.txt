Opportunity to reinforce how resource hungry the programme is

Opportunity to raise the need to release enough experienced staff to act as mediators. Kevin has said that the current list of

staff and length of release will threaten NT

5. Key Risks & ISSUES - extracted trom programme register

Background’ \ Programme \ Programme\ Performance:
Conte: Governance / Plan Dashboard
Risk/Issue n(s) / Update cod

There is a risk that the JFSA
&/or Second Sight disengage
from the Working Group over
the scope of Second Sights
role or the terms of reference
for the Working Group

Second Sight and JFSA
consider the scope of Second
Sight work to extend beyond
the Scheme and in any event,
have taken a very wide view of
Second Sight's investigatory
role within the Scheme

PV will be engaging AH directly before the next face-to-face
Working Group.

Post Office have reviewed all published materials; so far
there are no grounds to justify increasing the scope of the
Working Group.

Aletter of engagement has been drafted. Second Sight
have declined to sign the current draft and have asked for a
number of amendments to be made. Post Office is
considering these.

CA has opened discussions to consider engaging an
alternative accountancy firm.

Apaper will be drafted for ExCo, for onward transmission to
the Board on the Scheme in general, covering the
heightened risk and contractual relationship with Second
Sight.

6. Second Sight Engagement (22)
Programme \ Programme\ Performance Key Risks \ SS Stakeholde:
Governance / Plan Dashboard / &Issues /EngagemenI Engagemery

Second Sight engagement has been challenging and looks to be reaching
a decision point.

* Second Sight have refused to sign the terms of engagement
+ Post Office is spending approximately £30,000 per month (£0.5M to date)
+ Second Sight continue to seek to widen the scope of their engagement

* Second Sight capacity is limited (3 members of staff) and we have no
assurance that they can cope with the coming workload.

Post Office have proposed including the Board condition that they will not act against Post Office in the future - Second Sight
have refused to agree this.

Post Office has had only one substantive product - the interim report

Four initial case reports originally due in January have not been delivered delaying the progression of these cases through the
Scheme

* The Working Group's role is to ensure the Scheme is run in a fair and
efficient manner

+ Working Group (at the suggestion of JFSA and Second Sight) is seeking a
much wider scope

* The wider scope carries increased risk for Post Office

+ Post Office cannot allow the scope creep

* This is likely to lead to confrontation.

‘COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

Working Group will also be involved in making decisions on how particular cases should be managed through the Scheme
WG seeking to examine any issues that it sees as relevant across Horizon and Post Office’s business

Any attempt to restrict the scope will be met with hostility and accusations of attempting to fetter the independence of the
process

Particularly challenging given the issues around controlling the engagement with Second Sight

Key point is the Second Sight report is due on 27 February and we are in a critical window to manage that relationship and

In addition to our focus on Second Sight and JFSA we are taking
forward two other key strands of engagement:

James Arbuthnot and other interested MPs

Anthony Hooper (Chair of the Working Group)

‘COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

Paula and Alice held a positive meeting with James Arbuthnot. A follow up meeting is being arranged for Mid March with James
and other interested MPs.

Given the challenges posed by the other members of the Working Group maintaining strong relations with Tony will be critical.
Paula is going to meet with him in the next few weeks to ensure we are well placed should relations with JFSA or Second Sight
deteriorate further
