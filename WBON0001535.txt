Drop and Go Bug

Summary

« The Peak PC0260269 identified by the experts relates to an issue in branch involving a Drop and
Go transaction timing out in branch, but displaying as and recording as being successful in the
branch accounts. This particular instance of the issue involved the branch re-attempting the
same Drop and Go transaction.
