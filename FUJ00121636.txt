16.02 HF to send KB drafting re old PO responsibilities HF 26/05/04

Noted and I CLS provided an analysis of the “quick turnaround” (QT) CT’s,
Agreed I which provide the reason why the QT were required.

KB stated QT’s needed to be kept to the minimum, especially with

the onset of summer leave commitments etc. With better planning it

should be possible to reduce the number of bridging CT’s, for

example for Impact and Banking, necessitating turnarounds of less

than 2 weeks.

measures, provide suggestions at next Forum.

Noted KB explained that POL may wish to terminate the TSD and wanted
to know what commercial issues FS anticipated if that were done.
CLS outlined his understanding of discussions covering this at the
SMF where FS had proposed use of the spare capacity by adding
work to the TSD. CLS also suggested it may be possible to trade off
TSD capacity to cover the over limit status of the HSH.

16.06 CLS to provide a financial analysis and lead time to terminate the CLS 14/05/04

Noted KB explained, his understanding of how the new discount would
work, this was 20% from each CT (and a year end discount up to
7.5%), it was agreed that a memo amount would be put on each CT
to estimate the 20% element. The details of the discount structure
need not be shown on CT’s as they will be added to Schedule 10 of
the Agreement.

KB also wanted to know, when the new grading structure was going
to be introduced. CLS said that CT’s should be using the new
grading structure, and would be effective from 01/04/04.

HF said that until the new grading rates were introduced into the
contract nothing should be changed. It was also agreed that the
Demand Planning Forum would need to have detailed information
for resource purposes.

16.09 HF to raise the necessary CCN to introduce the appropriate new HF 26/05/04
grading structure and the discount mechanism for additional SI

Noted CLS stated that the rates quoted in Liam Foley’s letter of 10
December 2003, would be subject to an RPI increase (2.8%)

KB said that the letter stated that the rates applied until 31 March
2005, so no adjustment was due this year.

16.10 CLS and KB to check with Liam Foley and Ian O’Driscoll CLS/KB I 07/05/04
respectively whether the rates in the letter would be subject to the
RPI increase of 31/03/04

16.11 CLS to provide a draft CCN for Schedule 12 Benefits (from letter of CLS 07/05/04
25/03/04 to Tam Curran)

16.13 HF to check current position with Tony Drahota regarding status of HF 30/04/04

Noted

KB explained that POL may wish to exercise the option of increasing
the number of Audit Record Queries, however Schedule 10 para
5.12, was unclear about any increased costs which may apply if this
option is taken.

To get nearer to the volumes that POL now wanted we would need to
go up 2 steps on the published scale. It was agreed that FS would
provide details of the notice period needed to go up 2 steps at the
same time, the possibility of amending the contractually prescribed
limits resulting from “step 2”, the availability of any capacity to
provide additional Audit Record Queries for DWP probably until
2007 and any additional costs that might be incurred.

16.14

FS to consider POL request surrounding Audit Record Queries and
will provide an update at the next Commercial Forum.

HF explained that following a number of suggested improvements to
the existing CT form from Post Office it was agreed that the first
page of the revised CT form would be introduced, with one of the 2
requested sets of check boxes (specifying the Development
Lifecycle Stage), but with “other (Specify)” replaced by “not
applicable”. FS would propose changes to the deliverables list that
had been requested.

16.15

HF to provide FS response on possible inclusion of “deliverables”
list on CT form as requested by POL.

HF

21/05/04
