David / Penny,

Just to let you know that I've just had a call from Charles McLachlan who is the Defence "Expert" in this case asking
when it would be convenient to talk things through with him.

I've agreed to talk to him at 9am tomorrow morning.
Regards

Subject: REGINA v SEEMA MISRA GUILDFORD CROWN COURT TRIAL - 15TH MARCH 2010

On Behalf Of

URGENT
David,
Thank you. I would be grateful if Mr Jenkins is asked the following:-

1 Inrelation to the Eleanor Nixon statement, the information we
received that although Maureen Lyme states she cannot remember specific
Offices she has stated that pre August 2005 Offices were using a separate
system for debit / credit card transactions called Streamline. Offices

would put debit / credit cards through this system and produce a receipt,
which could be keyed into the Horizon terminals.

Some Postmaster / Clerks would key in the information into Horizon as cash,
instead of debit / credit cards resulting in a shortage in Offices. If

Post Offices contacted Chesterfield at the time any Branch discrepancies
were dealt with, and sorted out with the individual Post Offices.

Therefore the problems were results of incorrect account produce and not a
problem with the Horizon system. No information is available for any
Correction Notices pre August 2005. So the Nixon statement is unlikely to
have any relevance for our present case of Misra.

2 The areas where Mr Jenkins says for POL to respond should be deleted
from his statement.

Mr Jenkins needs to comment on the third interim report received from the
Defence Expert.

The quality of training of SPMs is obviously outside Mr Jenkins expertise.
However I wonder if he might be prepared to comment on how it might be
possible to examine the Horizon data to investigate mistakes.

We are keen that the Defence are given suggestions as to how they can
efficiently test their theories against the Horizon data. We do not want

them to say that they will not have time before the Trial. We anticipate

that it would not be very difficult to test their theories against a short

but represented span of data example from the months when Mrs Misra has
admitted to false accounting. (15th November 2006 to 14th December 2006,
16th May 2007 to 16th June 2007, 14th November 2007 to 15th December 2007
and 9th January 2008. It would be helpful if Mr Jenkins could consider

practical and efficient ways in which the Defence might be able to test

their theories.

I also refer you to my E-Mail to you of Friday 5th February 2010 at 15.39
paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.

Thank you in anticipation of your help.
