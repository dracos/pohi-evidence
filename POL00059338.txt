Hi Steve,

Given that Ishaq has shown no sign of pleading it is sensible that we consider the ways in which the
prosecution case can be bolstered. Please therefore find attached Rachael's advice which highlights
the further steps which could usefully be taken at this stage. I think that you may have seen the
Defence Case Statement and the Report of Gareth Jenkins before, but I have attached them just in case
you have not.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

Martin.
