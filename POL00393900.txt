Variance comments:

© Please note that all ‘plan’ numbers are taken from the SCS manpower plan baseline (approved in February 2000), and are reflected in the Template

Management Database (TMD).

© Transitional staff reduced by 99 this month, ic. from 273 (period 12 1999/2000) to 174 this period. Additional reductions are planned throughout this

year (in the context of some forecast additions) in order to achieve the overall target reduction.

POL-BSFF-0220570
© Interim posts have decreased by 100 since baseline, mostly attributable to changes this period, ie. interim helpline staff have decreased by 22, and 79
interim TP staff have changed status (21 transfered from PON to POSG; 58 roles became templated roles in PON). There has been a small increase in
interim stores roles (ie. +3).

The variance of +158 templated roles can be explained largely by a number of agreed additions to PON template since the baseline figure was agreed in
February 2000, eg. the 58 TP roles described above, as well as 30 Horizon cluster support roles.

© numbers reported are Period 1 budget and actuals, Prime costs and no Inter-business charges.

© Budget Includes £4m development(assessed) but there has been little spend this month.

Actuals Include £3m costs of Recoverable VAT which were no re-accrual. These were expected to be transferred to group.

© We have been advised of other omissions and there are misplacements in the accounts arising from mis coding by [A2000. We are in the process of
quantifying these to advise group finance to resolve.

© It was not unusual for POCL to underspend in the early couple of months whilst budgets bedded in. More in depth analysis needs to be conducted to
establish how much is available to offset budget gap, if any.

© There was a further £ 8.5 m. of weighted risk identified for which a budget is held centrally.

© The £ 0.4m. weighted risk disguises a total risk of (£ 14 m.) with opportunities of £ 13.1 m. (details on attached sheet )

* Anapproach to managing theses risks needs to be d

-d and agreed at PONEC

¢ Initial recommendation is that finance review cach item with directorates to :
1. Clarify the issue.
2. Test weighting.
3. Check with budget or ABB process for potential double counting.
