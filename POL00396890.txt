Executive Summary

Scope and Approach

We have asked PwC to perform a follow up review of the initial IT benchmarking exercise completed in May 2008 as part of their on-
going support to the IT governance and controls enhancement programme. This activity is ongoing, and we summaries key actions
and progress since the May Audit Committee update. Attached is the updated IT controls benchmarking table which highlights
progress. Management assessed that the circled areas should receive our initial focus and significant progress has been achieved in

the last quarter.

PwC has independently assessed our progress in these areas through detailed interviews and review of key documentation. The
summary findings are documented below:

Summary Findings

The IT organisational structure has significantly changed since the beginning of 2008. This has positively influenced staffing and key
processes within Group Technology. Significant progress has been made in the recruitment of new staff into key positions. In the past
3 months, 41 verbal offers have been accepted, with 17 new members having already commenced employment. This does not include
the recruitment of 5 out of the 7 REMCO previously vacant positions within IT.

One of the key actions following restructuring has been to develop a more comprehensive process for capturing, managing and
mitigating IT risks. This change programme is ongoing with key focus being on embedding the new organisational structures and
where appropriate the recruitment of additional key skills by Q4 2008.

The initial review of the control environment identified a number of weaknesses which were grouped into the 4 key areas below.
Recent significant initiatives that have enhanced the specific control environment in these areas have also been documented:

¢ Access Control

- Disk encryption is being rolled out to the laptop and desktop environment. This project is expected to be completed in
October.

- Personal firewalls are being rolled out to Royal Mail laptops in a phased approach.

¢ IT Policies, Standards and Procedures

- The review of the information security policy framework and document set has been presented to the CIO anda
refresh of existing policies has been commissioned (targeted for completion by the end of September 2008).

~ The roll out of a standard project methodology has been initiated with the design and communication of the Harmony
approach.

© Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

- An application conformance project has been instigated to ensure that all critical applications adhere to a specific set
of minimum resilience standards

- Amirroring architecture design for the data centres has been implemented allowing for substantially increased
resilience.

- Critical batches are now covered by the key business function process, ensuring that all errors and incomplete
batches are identified and resubmitted.

¢ New Technology and Systems
- Tracked Plus, the roll out of hand held devices for delivery staff, has reached stage 1 of its deployment strategy.
- Discussions are underway for new web channel architecture and tech refresh strategy

Executive Summary

Next Steps

In addition to the completed work highlighted by PwC, there are other areas where performance improvement is being progressed.
The most significant is work underway by CSC in their service improvement “30-60-90 day” plan. This is primarily focused on service
delivery and is monitored on a regular basis through defined critical success factors. A high level overview of progress made to date is
detailed in appendix A. Further actions by priority area are listed below:

¢ A review of the monitoring of third parties’ SLAs against agreed Royal Mail minimum standards.

- Analysis and identification of all relevant third party contracts has substantially been completed by the commercial
delivery group within Service Delivery. In parallel an assessment of adherence to Royal Mail standards has been
initiated with findings due in Q3 2008.

Review and possible redesign of the critical IT systems prioritisation list and agreed escalation routes. This should include a
review of the current accepted response times and system ownership.

- Alignment of change management controls with COBIT has commenced and is planned to be completed by the end of
December 08.

¢ The implementation of a process to assess the impact of system changes on existing systems through the introduction of a
revised Project Management Methodology.

- The first iteration of Harmony has been rolled out and is being applied across the group.
- The revised gating methodology has been completed in June and applied to the major programmes of work in August.

¢ The implementation of group wide data standards, including key ownership and compliance with legislative and regulatory
processes

- Work has not yet been commenced in this area
