Subject: With Kelly re POL —

Hi Kelly, I’ve sent you an email about POL — we need to get on and appoint the interim
CEO asap as we can't have the organisation leaderless at such a time. Greg agrees.
Have also sent you my take on the litigation. Hope this helps! Thanks a mill, Alex.

Thanks Alex - i agree we need an interim but I'm very unhappy about not having a
process in place or agreed in regards to recruitment plan for new CEO and it would not
be at all satisfactory for this to drag on. I am getting increasing concerned about what's
going on with the post office - many thanks Kelly

Totally share your dissatisfaction (and have shared with POL and UKGI) and your
worries. That said we need to help them get out of a hole - even though they helped
make it! Best A
