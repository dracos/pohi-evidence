Please see paragraph 20.4 of the attached draft of Second Sight's Part 2 report. This paragraph was omitted from the
final report but it provides some useful context against which the question should make more sense.

Please also see paragraph 17.1 of the final report (also attached). I hope this is helpful

lam speaking to my colleagues to try to identify specific cases where this issue has arisen. I will provide you with any
further information as soon as I nave it.

Kind regards

Paul

Morning Dave

Further to Belinda's email below, please see attached the a table setting out all the Second Sight questions POL is
proposing to answer and the relevant person to whom each question has been assigned.

The questions we would be grateful if you could answer are as follows:
- Question 3 (we have also sent this question to Andy Holt so to avoid duplication of work, please can you liaise
with him?);
~ Question 9 (again this question has also been sent to Andy Holt).

You will notice, the numbering jumps around a little. That is the result of our removing some questions from Second
Sight's original list because they were either outside the scope of the scheme or POL has already answered them.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
I look forward to receiving your answers - thanks for all your help.
Kind regards

Paul

Dear all

As part of the finalisation of their Part Two Report, Second Sight has prepared a long list of questions for Post Office on
various themes running through the scheme.

You have been identified as someone within POL who may be able to provide some of the answers needed. The

questions have been broken down into categories and you will be sent the questions that we think you may be able to
help with individually.
