RMGA Customer Service Problem Management Process

FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1 Introduction’

1.1 Process Objective and Scope

The objective of this document is to define the process for Problem Management in the POA
environment. For the purpose of this document a Problem is defined as the unknown underlying root
cause of one or more Incidents.

The Problem Management Process covers both reactive and proactive functions of Problem
Management.

The scope of Reactive Problem Management is from identification of a Problem through to closure and
includes root cause analysis, identification of Known Errors, initiation of any necessary Change Requests
and the provision of management information to POA & POL. Problem Management is responsible for
ensuring that resources are prioritised to resolve Problems in the appropriate order based on business
need.

The scope of Proactive Problem Management includes trend analysis and investigation to identify
potential Problems, which are then progressed through the Problem Management process to be removed
from the estate.

For clarity it should be noted that individual Problems are owned by the Service Delivery Manager
responsible for the Service most affected by the Problem. In the event that multiple Services are
impacted, the Service Delivery Team Manager / Head of Service Management will appoint an SDM as
Problem Manager, who will remain in this role until the Problem has been resolved.

1.2 Process Rationale

The primary goal of the Problem Management process is to minimise adverse impact of Incidents and
Problems on the Post Office Estate, and to proactively prevent the re-occurrence of Incidents, Problems
and Errors. Problem Management focuses on finding the root cause of Incidents, creating Known Errors
and permanently removing Errors from the estate through the Change Management Process.

Although a Problem may be identified at any time, the management of Problems is essentially
conducted during office hours; i.e. 09:00 - 17:30 Monday to Friday, excluding Bank Holidays.

1.3 Roles and Responsibilities

1.3.1. Process Owner

The owner of the process is the POA Service Delivery Manager responsible for the Service most
affected by the Problem. The Process Owner, otherwise known as the Problem Manager, is appointed by
the Service Delivery Team Manager. Process owner responsibilities include:

Overseeing Problem Management Process

Investigating potential resolutions

Assessing if and when to resolve

Defining target effectiveness metrics

Ensuring Reports, Audits and Reviews are carried out regularly and effectively

Acceptance by Document review (DR) for Requirement SER-2144.

1.1.2. Problem Resolver

The Problem Resolver is responsible for finding a resolution to the problem, and is assigned by the
Problem Manager.

1.1.3. Knowledge Manager

The Knowledge Manager is responsible for the information held in the Knowledge base and KEL, which
is updated by the HSD. The Knowledge Manager should be appointed by the Service Delivery Team
Manager.

1.1.4 Service Delivery Team Manager

The Service Delivery Team Manager is responsible for appointing a Problem Manager and Knowledge
Manager, ensuring Reports, Audits and Reviews are carried out regularly and effectively, and organising
and chairing Problem Review meetings. Meetings should be held as problems arise on an ad hoc basis,
but at least once a month.

3.1

Risks & Dependencies

Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

3.2

Insufficient time and resource to build and maintain a Knowledgebase

Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation procedures
Resistance by parties to carry out pro-active recommendations to reduce number of Incidents.
Mitigation is to investigate and address any issues, before escalating to senior management
Increased business and operational impact through lack of Problem progress updates to POL.
Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff

Unavailability of sufficient tools for problem diagnosis

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems

The provision of inadequate staff training

Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering

Loss of any infrastructure component which links support systems to the live estate

Dependencies

This process is dependent on:

e Effective use of the process by IMT and SDUs
e Effective routing of Problems to SDUs and third parties
« Effective escalation procedures within Fujitsu, POL and third parties
e POL acceptance of feedback, contributing to end user education and reduced Incident rates
« Effective collaboration diagnosis between SDU’s and third parties

4.1.1.1 A Problem Record is opened following a Major Incident, in relation to trend analysis, or as
the result of an Incident for which there is no existing problem record being received through
contact (see definition in Section 2.0 above) with the HSD from:

Users

Fujitsu SDUs

POA IT Service Management

Third Parties

Fujitsu Service Delivery Management

4.1.1.2 If a Problem Record already exists, it should be updated and the new Incident should be
attached as a Child. If a KEL or workaround exists it should be implemented at this stage, but
the Problem Management process should still be followed to ensure that a resolution is found
if possible.

4.1.1.3 The Problem Manager should understand and define the scope of the problem.

4.1.1.4 The Problem Manager and Resolver should identify and record the problem and proceed to

step 1.2.1.

4.1.2.1 The Problem Manager and Resolver assess the problem and capture Sense and Respond
codes.

4.1.2.2 If the Problem is discovered to not in fact be a problem, the Problem Manager should proceed
to step 4.1.4.5.

3 If the Problem is indeed classified as a Problem, Priority should be assigned using the Priority
Matrix (see Appendix A)

4.1.2.4 Save the Problem Record

4.1.2.5 The Problem Management allocates ownership of the problem to the Service team whose
area is most affected by the problem, and assign resources for dealing with the problem.

4.1.2.6 The Problem Manager assigns ownership of the Problem Record to a particular SDM within
the service team, and proceeds to step 4.1.3.1

4.2.3.1 The Problem Manager and the Resolver assess whether a permanent solution is justified.
There are eight possible outcomes to this.

4.2.3.2 The impact is deemed minimal and thus the resolution is not cost-justifiable.
4.2.3.3 The impact will not be minimal, but the resolution is not cost-effective.
4.2.3.4 The resolution is release-connected and can be included in the next major release.

4.2.3.5 The resolution is release-connected and should be solved immediately, without waiting for the
next major release.

4.2.3.6 The resolution is itself release-independent but will have an impact on another release: e.g.
the resolution requires testing on a test rig, which is already fully booked for testing on a major
release and therefore the testing may impact release plans.

7 The resolution is release-independent and can be fully financed by Fujitsu Services Customer
Services.

4.2.3.8 The resolution requires funding from POL.
4.2.3.9 The resolution requires action by POL.

4.2.3.10 \f the Problem Manager decides that a permanent solution is not justified, the Problem
Record should be made dormant and monitored. Any further reoccurrences will be linked to the
original record and the problem can be reassessed for future resolution.

4.2.3.11 \f the Problem Manager decides that a permanent solution is justified, proceed to step

4.2.4.1.

A Appendix: Priority Generation

Incident / Problem Priority generation

Accriticality value will be assigned by the account to each of their Classifications, as per the table below:

Criticality Value (1-5)
Critical 1
High 2
Medium 3
Minor 4
(Cosmetic — Incident only) / Change (Incident & Problem) 5

Based on the value selected by the Agent for the number of users affected, and the Criticality assigned
to the Classification they have chosen, an Impact value will be calculated using the table below. For
example, if the account has decided that the 'Security.Firewall.IInstall' Classification has a Criticality of 2,
and the number of users affected is 10% - 40%, an Impact value of 2 will be generated.

Urgency Definition

1 e Has a significant adverse impact on the delivery of service to a large number
of end users.

« Causes significant financial loss and/or disruption.

e Results in any material loss or corruption of customer data.

« I For example, incidents with this urgency may affect the COMPANY
