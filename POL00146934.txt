Belinda,

This is always going to be contentious as Alan firmly believes there are problems with Horizon even though SS found nothing and
we've seen nothing to date to support Alan's view.

The consideration is do we want a difficult discussion now or do we want to let the evidence of the cases determine any messages we
use going forward. My preference is the latter.

Hi

In terms of alans point re systemic issues this is something we have debated before with him. We had previously agreed with him to
use the wording from the interim report which was thay there was no evidence so far of systemic issues. This is the wording used in
our releases

Happy to discuss later.
Ruth

Universal Time

On the numbers, I think that we can easily settle that today.

On the point about about the system, the fact is that no such problems have been found. We cannot draft something in the
anticipation that something may be. And the Scheme is not designed to identify such problems, it is to deal with complaints. For the
benefit of getting something out, I would have no problems with omitting the sentence, subject to what others think, but we should
make the point. I suggest we do so at the call tomorrow just to lodge it but then agree to remove it and get the statement on its
website

But I would be grateful for the views of others.

Best wishes
Belinda

'Two points:-

First, I thought the number of applications received, at the time when no more were being accepted, was 147.

Secondly, and more of a problem for JFSA to support, is the comment that there 'were no systemic issues with the system’. This, as
most of you are aware, has been one of the key points we, JFSA, has been raising for years, and it is these systemic failures that will

become clearly evident as the Scheme progresses.’
