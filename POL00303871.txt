Subject: FW: WG minutes - 17th April

Attachments: WG Call Minute 17th April.docx

Kath, Shirley,

When you read the attached please ignore the comment from SS that POL’s investigations are inadequate — this was Ron
having a pop in an attempt to cover his lack of output!

There are a number of cases that I need to provide an update to the WG call on Thursday — would you let me have an
update on your respective cases by midday tomorrow please. If any cases require action from me then please flag to me at
this point.

There is also an action about numbering the supporting documents — would you please ask the guys to do this. So at the
top of each supporting document there needs to be the document number (like you would for appendices). Also the WG

asked that these be uploaded to Huddle in sequence ie doc I first, doc 2 second ete.

Thanks,
Angela
