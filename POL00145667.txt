Rear Mau,

Thank you for your email letter of 9 July about 2nd Sight Interim Report on the Post
Office Horizon computer system.

I have noted the concerns you raise. In respect of the additional cases that have very
recently been raised with you, as I made clear in the debate following my statement to
the House of Commons on 9 July, further cases can be put forward for review by
Second Sight.

With regard to your key area of concern about the approach of Post Office investigators
when financial discrepancies arose, I would recommend that you raise this in the
working party Post Office Ltd is committed to establishing to address issues around its
approach to these matters and on which I shall be seeking regular progress reports.
