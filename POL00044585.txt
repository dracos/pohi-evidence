in the event of a conviction Counsel is requested to seek an order for compensation in a sum to be
notified in due course. Counsel is also asked to seek an order for the Defendant to pay a contribution
towards the costs of the Prosecution in a sum to be notified to Counsel at Court. [These costs should
include costs of investigation which have been notified to the Defence in accordance with the Court of
Appeal decision in Regina v Associated Octel Ltd [1997] 1 CR.APP.R.(S) 435]. In the event that a
Confiscation Order is sought the Judge dealing should be specifically asked by Counsel to include as part

owed to Royal Mail.

The Officer in the case has been asked to arrange for Antecedents to be produced, and to supply dates

to avoid for the relevant witnesses.

please contact his Instructing Solicitor.
