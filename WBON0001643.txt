Andy — can you please give me a call re the below.

I need to be sure I’ve understood correctly what the costs update of £12.8m provided to the Court in late May /
early June 2019 covers and doesn’t cover, and the amount of any costs not covered (e.g. strike out application,
recusal, appeal etc)

Thanks, Rod

All

I nee to urgently provide the Minister with what has been incurred in costs to date on the Group Litigation. I
would have thought we breakdown the costs over the last two years together with the recent costs orders
against Post Office. This needs to go tonight as she is appearing before the BEIS select committee tomorrow

morning. We did have this (I think) as part of Al’s briefing on the select committee.

Could we urgently get this together so I can email her tonight. She is standing by for the email.
