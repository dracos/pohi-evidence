I, Richard John Cross, will say as follows. . .

   1. I am a former employee of Post Office Ltd

   2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

       with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 18th August 2023.

   3. I have been asked to set out a summary of my career and qualifications, an

       account of my role and the policies/practices in place in relation to the audit,

       and inspection process, and my recollections of three specific cases that had

       resulted in prosecutions.

Career Summary

   4. 1 first started working for Post Office, (later to become Post Office Ltd), as a

       Postal Officer, in October 1978. My first branch was Tarporley Salaried Sub

       Office. I remained there until 1990 when I became Assistant Branch Manager

       at Whitchurch Branch Office. Following the closure of the branch in 1995 1

                                                                                 W ITN 09270100




   transferred to Ellesmere Port Branch Office. At Ellesmere Port I performed the

   roles of Postal Officer, Assistant Branch manage, and occasional ly Branch

   Manager.

5. During 1999, a classroom for training new Postmasters, and POL staff was

   being set up at Ellesmere Port. Talking with the trainer setting up the room, I

   became very interested in the training process. When an advertisement for a

   reserve trainer came up, I successfully applied for the position. This involved

   completing Postmaster training when insufficient regular trainers were

   available to satisfy the demand.

6. During 1999 the regional training team was temporarily expanded, and I was

   seconded to the team full time.

7. After returning to the Branch Office, for a short time, I was offered a

   permanent position in the regional training team.

8. My experience of working in the different types of crown post Offices, and my

   extensive knowledge of transactions and procedures, having grown up in a

   retail environment, and understanding the challenges facing Sub Postmasters

   starting their first post offices, meant I was well suited to my role.

9. The regional training teams were united and became one national team. My

   title became Field Support Officer. The role included training, and intervention

   visits to branches that were experiencing specific problems they needed help

   with.

10.As a national team, we were split into several teams of approximately 12

   members. Each team had a team leader, of management level, who was our

   immediate line manager. Above the Team Leader there were regional,

                                                                                      W I TN 09270100




      managers, and a national manager. Unfortunately, I no longer remember their

      correct titles.

   11. During 2008 the National Field Support team merged with the national Audit

      team. We were expected to perform each other's roles. I was not given a

      choice whether I wanted to become an auditor. The only other option would

      have been to leave the team.

   12. During my time in the Field Support Team. I found my colleagues to be

      knowledgeable, committed to performing a good job, and genuinely trying to

      give an excellent service to our customers.

   13. On 30th October 2016 I left Post Office Ltd. I currently work on a part time

      basis, for a Postmaster who runs nine post offices.

   15. My job as an auditor consisted of assisting at audits, and leading audits. The

      lead audit would manage the audit and delegate tasks to other members of

      the team performing the audit. The lead would explain to the Postmaster the

      reason for the visit, and explain what is about to happen, liaise with the

      Contracts Manager, and other departments. Explain to the Postmaster the

      results of the audit, and finally complete all the reports.



      blame to any individual if discrepancies were discovered. I knew any possible

      investigation was outside of my role.

                                                                                  W ITN 09270100




17. As stated, I became an auditor in 2008. This was due to the merging of the

   Field Support Team and the Audit team. I had never considered applying for

   the role of auditor. I am not aware of the process by which the members of the

   existing audit team were recruited. To my knowledge they had all been

   recruited internally.

18. My training for the role of Auditor consisted of one day of induction training, by

   an experienced audit manager, in a classroom. I went on three audits to

   observe how they were performed. Most of my learning of the audit process

   was gained by performing audits. I was lucky that my first Team Leader was

   an experienced Audit Manager, and she gave excellent guidance. At regular

   team meetings she would give useful advice on completing reports, and how

   to conduct ourselves during audits. The experienced auditors in our team

   were always available to guide me when unexpected developments were

   come across for the first time.

19. 1 was never aware if there was a minimum qualification and/or experience an

   auditor needed before conducting a branch audit. In my case, I had thirty

   years of experience working in all types, and sizes, of post offices, I was well

   aware of the rules and regulations, and I was accurate when counting cash

   and stock. Above all, my experience of working with Sub Postmasters meant I

   knew how their branches were run, and the pressures, they were very often

   under.

20. 1 consider the training given to perform my role as an auditor was adequate. I

   would have preferred more time shadowing an experienced auditor before

   being sent to conduct live audits. Looking back, I do not think telling a whole

   team they were going to be auditors was an ideal thing to do. I personally

                                                                                      W ITN 09270100




        embraced the challenge, but telling people they must now perform a role they

        had never considered could have led to lack of commitment for some.

   21. 1 have been asked to consider document P0L00084650.

   22. I did not have any input in planning and scheduling audits. Audits were

        scheduled for several reasons. At the time I was auditing there were very few

        random audits, apart from ones used to give us new auditors experience.

        Most audits were scheduled as a result of concerns shown by other

        departments, such as cash management. There were other audits scheduled

        for branch closures and transfers to new Postmasters.

   23. 1 do not know how long it took from planning, and scheduling an audit, to it

        being carried out. It would depend on the volume of work being undertaken at

        any one time, and the availability of auditors. Audits following a branch

        robbery or burglary would take precedence, and performed on the same, or

        next, day.

   24. 1 would be sent a schedule of duties, that could be updated daily. It would tell

        me where I was to go, and the activity that was required. In my case this was

        usually an audit or a training activity. When performing an audit all I would be

        required to do is research the location, opening hours, and name of the

        Postmaster. Occasionally I would be sent additional information relating to the

        specific audit, for example the branch was not making daily cash declarations,

        and cash management were suspicious of why this was happening, I am sure

        enquiries and investigations were carried out before the audits, but I cannot

        say who did them.

    25. 1 am unaware of any variations in respect of scheduling audits at Crown

        Offices and other branch.

    26. 1 have been asked to consider the following documents: P0L00083966,

        P0L00084801, P011-00085534. P01-00087627, P0L00088252,

        P0L00087672, P0L00084003. P0L00084813, P0L00085652,

        P0L00086765, P0L00087688, P0L00087716 and P0L00087614.

    27. Before completing an audit, the only databases, I had access to, gave me the

        details of the branch location, opening times, Postmaster's name etc.

        Occasionally I would be sent extra information about any concerns other

        departments had about the branch. As a rule, I was just told where and when

        to perform the audit. No investigations were carried out by me.

    28. If a discrepancy or shortfall was found at an audit the lead auditor would

        contact the relevant Contract Advisor who deals with that branch. The

        Contract Advisor would decide what action was to be taken. No further

        enquiries or investigations would be carried out by the auditor, except simply

        asking if the Postmaster had any ideas what had caused the enquiry.

    29. 1 was not aware of Auditors asking Postmasters to make good discrepancies

        on the day of the audit, in normal circumstances. My understanding was that

        discrepancies had to be made good at the end of the next Trading Period.

        However, I was sometimes asked by the Contract Advisors to ask the

        Postmaster if they wanted to make good the discrepancy, if they were to be

       suspended from the office. These were known as "without Prejudice

        Payments" as they would not affect the outcome of any investigation, or

        possible prosecution. These payments were voluntary. There was a proforma

                                                                                     WITNO9270100
                                                                                W ITN 09270100




   we carried specifically for these payments. The Postmaster would be given a

   copy, and a second copy would be filed with the audit paperwork.

30. If a discrepancy or shortfall was discovered at audit the Postmaster was

   always invited to undertake a check on the figures we had produced.

31.The Postmaster would be kept fully informed at each step of the audit, and

   invited to ask any questions, or voice any concerns throughout the process.

   Any concerns raised would be addressed by the Lead auditor, if possible. Any

   serious issues, or things the Lead Auditor was unable to deal with would be

   escalated. If it was the conduct of a member of the audit team, the issue

   would be raised to the Auditor's line manager. If the issue was about the audit

   result, or the Postmaster was unhappy that the audit was taking place, it

   would be raised with the Contract Manager.

32. 1 am not aware of how an audit could have been carried out without the

   Horizon IT system.

33. I don't recall audits at Crown branches being any different to other branches,

   apart from the Postmasters of sub offices were liable for any shortfall

   discovered during the audit. In a Crown branch the person responsible for the

   shortfall would be subject to internal disciplinary measures that may, or not,

   lead to that person making good the shortfall.

34. 1 have been asked to consider the following documents: FUJO0001 894 and

   POL00002841.

35. I am totally unaware of what involvement Fujitsu had in the audit process, if

   any.

36. My understanding of an Audit Global User Account was it was a personal log

   on ID given to Auditors that enabled them to log on to the horizon IT system,


                                   Page 7 of 16

                                                                                  W ITN 09270100




   at any terminal in the network. Usually when obtaining access to the Horizon

   system the Auditor would ask the Postmaster to create a user ID for them.

   The Global User ID was only to be used to log on when there was no one of

   manager level available to add the Auditor to the system.




37. 1 have been referred to the following documents: POL00091046 and

   POL00091109.

38.The audit of 3 September 2010, at Hightown, took place during the migration

   to the Next Generation Horizon system. As part of the migration process the

   migration officer would check the cash on hand on the evening prior to the

   migration. On the evening of 2 September 2010, the migration officer, Tracey

   Bedford, found a shortfall in the cash Of £13,624.41. She reported it to the

   migration team, and they requested an audit of branch, before the migration

   could take place.

39.The lead auditor was Jeff Roper. I went along to assist him. I counted all the

   cash and stock in the branch. Jeff entered all the figures onto the audit tool,

   known as a P32. After completing the audit, it was discovered the overall

   branch shortfal l was £14,842,37. Jeff Roper relayed the findings to the

   Contract Advisor, Karen Arnold, who suspended Ms Hall.

40. 1, personally did not have any discussions with Ms Hall. Jeff Roper was Lead

   Auditor; any discussions were between the two of them.

41.The only documents considered during the audit were daily cash declaration

   print outs, these clearly showed Ms Hall had been falsifying her cash

   declarations to conceal the shortfall.

                                                                                   W ITN 09270100




42. Ms Hall told Jeff Roper, in my presence, that she had been having problems

   with accounting for National Lottery scratch cards. The Post Office Lottery

   team confirmed this. They said Ms Hall had been receiving transaction

   corrections caused by failing to enter scratch card receipts on to the Horizon

   system, over a period of eighteen months.

43. The size of the shortfall was not particularly unusual, considering that Ms Hall

   had been experiencing problems over a long period.

44. 1 had no awareness of any previous audits, carried out at Hightown. This was

   I the first, and last time, I visited the branch.

45. Following the audit, I had no further involvement this case. I had no contact

   with either Paul Whittaker or Christopher Knight and was not required to give

   a witness statement. The audit result was reported to the Contract manager,

   Karen Arnold. Karen made the decision to suspend Ms Hall. After the audit I

   was never informed of the investigation, and, to today's date, I never been

   told of the outcome to the case and was unaware Ms Hall had been

   prosecuted.

46. I would like to add, in my opinion, given that the problems with the lottery

   accounting had been continuing over an extended period, help should have

   been offered to Ms Hall earlier. The shortfall would have been minimised, or,

   possibly, avoided.




47. I have been referred to the following documents: POL00094273,

   P0L00044159, P0L00057374 and P0L00044198.

48. 1 was assigned, by the audit scheduling team, to attend an audit of Fazakerley

   branch, on 5th September 2012. The lead auditor was Tim Gordon-Pounder.

                                                                                 W ITN 09270100




49. During the audit, my role was to count the cash and valued stock. Tim, as

   leader, input my figures onto the Horizon system, and to produce the audit

   reports. It was his job to contact the Contracts Adviser, and liaise with Fraud

   Investigators, following the audit.

50. During the audit Steve Bradshaw and Kevin Ryan, Fraud Investigators, were

   both present at the branch. The Postmaster, MrAsker, was not at the branch

   during the audit.

51. I was told, by Tim Gordon Pounder, that the audit had been requested by

   Steve Bradshaw, following complaints by Santander bank that cash deposits

   made at Fazakerley were being held back. From what Tim said, I understood

   that one of the staff had told Steve Bradshaw that they had been suppressing

   the bank payments to cover an ongoing shortfall at the branch.

52. The audit resulted in a surplus of £559.07. The audit was concluded. The

   result would not normally have raised any concerns.

53.Our role in this case was concluded. After the audit, the Fraud Investigators

   took over. They discovered bank debit slips, in the branch, that had not been

   inputted onto Horizon. If they had been inputted the branch would have had a

   shortfall. The role of Tim Gordon-Pounder and I was to verify the cash and

   stock on hand. Any shortfall that was later found was outside the parameters

   of the audit.

54. Tim Gordon-Pounder was asked to complete an audit report. He would not

   normally have made a report unless there had been a shortfall at the audit. I

   do not recall who asked him to make the report. I have no knowledge of any

   delayed reports.

55. After completing the audit part, of this case, I had no further involvement. I

   was never asked to write any reports, or witness statements. I was never told

   about what subsequently happened to Angela Sefton and Anne Nield and was

   never aware of any prosecution.

57.On 2"''d February 2012 1 was scheduled to lead an audit at Winsford Post

   Office. I had been told by the Contract Advisor, Denise Reid, that the reason

   for the audit was Mr Allen's landlord had reported the rent for the premises

   had not been paid for several months. I was sent to verify the assets of Post

   Office Ltd, in the branch, were correct.

58. 1 was accompanied on the audit by, my colleagues, Rob Lyon, Jane Timms,

   Paul Hayhurst, and Tim Gordon-Pounder. This was a branch with eleven

   individual stock units.

59. My role was to lead the audit by managing the other team members,

   assigning them tasks to perform, and inputting all the figures onto the audit

   at the branch. Mr Grant had asked the Post Office for an overscale payment

   to enable him to carry on running the branch. And he had been inflating the

   daily cash on hand figures, in the hope that the payment would be granted,

   enabling him to make good the shortfall.

62. 1 prepared a Record of Conversation, and asked Mr Allen to sign it. He

   declined to do so. I believed he would not sign the record because at that

   stage it was only between the two of us, and signing could have been seen as

   an admission of guilt.

63. At 8.45 1 contacted the Contracts Advisor, Denise Reid, with what Mr Allen

   had told me, and to expect a shortfall of £10,000. At 8.45 1 contacted Steve

   Bradshaw, Fraud Investigator, to relay my concerns.

64. 1 told my team members that we were now performing what is known as a tier

   2 audit. This meant the cash, and all items of stock was checked down to the

   last penny. The audit revealed a shortfall of £17,811.18, this included a

   previously declared shortage of £4645,24 that had not been made good.



   suspend Mr Allen. I did not have any input in this decision, but agreed it was

   necessary to suspend him until an investigation had been carried out.

66. I collected documents from the branch that included copies of Branch Trading

   Statements, and Overnight Cash Holdings, to give to a Fraud Investigator

   later.

67. I wrote an audit report. It was sent to Lesley Frankland, Fraud Team Leader,

   Denise Reid, Contracts Adviser, and David Patrick, Field Support Leader.

68. This was end of my involvement in the case, except for writing a witness

   statement requested by Steve Bradshaw, Fraud Investigator, in October 2012

    (POL00089071). I was never involved in any investigation of Mr Grant Allen. I

    was never involved in the proceedings against MrAllen. I was never told of

    the outcome of any proceedings against him.

69. 1 have been asked were ARQ logs sought by POL from Fujitsu. I do not know.

    I don't know what ARQ logs are. They are not something auditors would have

    been expected to deal with during my time in POL.

70. I am not aware of any previous audits at Winsford post office while Mr Allen

    was Postmaster. I had attended an audit at the branch for a transfer to Mr

    Allen from the previous Postmaster.

71. I would like to state here that as a POL auditor my role was very clear. I was

    to carry out an impartial check, of a branch, to verify the amounts of cash and

    stock were what they should be. If a discrepancy was found it was my duty to

    inform the relevant Contracts adviser. I was never involved in any of the

    subsequent investigations, except to occasionally be asked to complete a

    witness statement. On only two occasions did I get summoned to a court. And

    only once did I have to give evidence. I was never told the results of the

    investigations and was never told the outcomes.

72. During my time with POL, possible bugs, errors and defects in Horizon were

    never openly discussed. I still do not know what these consisted of. Had I

    been given more information on what was believed to be happening I would

    have known what to look for when visiting branches.

73. POL used to tell me it was a company that listened to its staff, but I was made

    to feel that included anything but bugs and errors on Horizon.

   74. 1 was told never to speak to Postmasters about the subject. If asked I was to

      say it was a robust system, and don't worry there is nothing wrong. I no longer

       remember who I spoke to, but I was told off by a manager who suspected I

       had agreed with a Postmaster that there were possible errors.

   75.As bugs and errors were rarely discussed I was unaware of what

       investigations were being carried out, and corrections being made. It would

       have been good to have regular updates. As I was in a role that involved

      working in branches, and talking to Postmasters, on a daily basis I may have

       been able to feed back any potential problems before they fully developed if

       had known if Horizon could be the cause.

   76. Finally, this episode in the history of POL highlights the need for open, and

      timely, communication between all levels of employees. No one should be

      afraid to raise genuine concerns.




I believe the content of this statement to be true.
