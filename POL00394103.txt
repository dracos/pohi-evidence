CODIFIED AGREEMENT

THIS CODIFIED AGREEMENT is made the 28th day of July, 1999
BETWEEN:

(1) Post Office Counters Ltd whose registered office is situated at Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill
Row, London EC1Y 8HQ; and

(2) ICL Pathway Limited whose registered office is at 26 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1SL
("the Contractor").

RECITALS
WHEREAS:

(a) On 15th May, 1996, the Secretary of State for Social Security acting through and on behalf
of the Department of Social Security and on behalf of the Department of Health and Social
Services for Northern Ireland (“DSS”) and POCL (collectively “the Authorities”) entered into
certain agreements (the “Related Agreements”) for the design, development, integration and
establishment by the Contractor of a computerised service infrastructure and for certain
services to be provided thereon;

(b) Such agreements comprised:

(i) an agreement between DSS and the Contractor for, inter alia, the provision by the
Contractor of services relating to a benefit payment card (the “DSS Agreement’);

(ii) an agreement between POCL and the Contractor for, inter alia, the provision by
the Contractor of the POCL Service Infrastructure and for certain services to be
provided thereon (the “POCL Agreement”); and

(iii) an agreement among DSS, POCL and the Contractor for the supply of a service
infrastructure and the provision of certain services which were of common interest
to both DSS and POCL (the “Authorities Agreement”);

(c) Each of the Related Agreements has been amended from time to time in accordance with
the change control procedures contained therein;

(d) On 24th May, 1999, DSS and the Contractor entered into an agreement under which, inter
alia, the DSS Agreement was terminated on that date;

(e) On 24th May, 1999 POCL and the Contractor entered into an agreement (the “Letter
Agreement”) under which they agreed that certain changes should be made to the POCL
Agreement and the Authorities Agreement with effect from that date.

(f) Under the Letter Agreement POCL and the Contractor agreed, inter alia, to replace the
POCL Agreement and the Authorities Agreement (each as amended under change control
procedures) with a single agreement (the “Codified Agreement”) codifying the changes to
those agreements agreed in the Letter Agreement;

CODIFIED AGREEMENT
(g) This Codified Agreement is the Codified Agreement referred to in the Letter Agreement.
(h) Commencing early 2001 POCL defined its requirements for a Network Banking Service

which will utilise the network of Post Office outlets for the delivery of a teller banking
service. The Contractor produced a systems requirement specification setting out its
proposals in response to those requirements, and on the parties signed CCN 850
which introduces the Network Banking Service and the PIN Pad Implementation Service
which the Contractor will provide as POCL Services under the terms of this Codified
Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

PART 1 : INTRODUCTION

Clause 101. Contract Structure

101.1 The Codified Agreement
Without prejudice to Clause 810.10 of this Codified Agreement, each of the POCL
Agreement and the Authorities Agreement is hereby terminated and replaced by the
provisions of this Codified Agreement with immediate effect.

101.2 I Amendments to Clauses, Schedules and Annexes of this Codified Agreement
Unless expressly provided otherwise in the provisions of this Codified Agreement, the
provisions of this Codified Agreement shall only be amended in accordance with the Change
Control Procedure.

101.3 Failure by POCL to perform its Obligations
The Contractor shall not be liable to POCL for any failure to perform or delay in performing
its obligations hereunder where the Contractor proves that such failure or delay has been
directly caused by the failure of POCL to perform any of its obligations under this Codified
Agreement. This Clause shall not apply to Clause 809, which shall be governed by the
specific rule stated in Clause 809.2 and shall not apply to the NBS, which shall be governed
by the provisions of Schedule N03.

Clause 102. Interpretation

102.1 As used in this Codified Agreement:

102.1.1 the terms and expressions set out in Schedule A1 shall have the meanings
ascribed therein;

102.1.2 the masculine includes the feminine and the neuter; and

102.2

102.3

102.4

102.5.1

102.1.3 the singular includes the plural and vice versa.

A reference to any statute, enactment, order, regulation or other similar instrument shall be
construed as a reference to the statute, enactment, order, regulation or instrument as
amended by any subsequent statute, enactment, order, regulation or instrument or as

contained in any subsequent re-enactment thereof.

Headings are included in this Codified Agreement for ease of reference only and shall not
affect the interpretation or construction of this Codified Agreement.

References in this Codified Agreement to Clauses, Parts and Schedules are, unless
otherwise provided, references to the clauses, parts and schedules of this Codified
Agreement. References to CCDs and CRDs are to the documents agreed as such from
time to time.

Subject to Clause 102.5.2, in the event and to the extent only of any conflict or
inconsistency between provisions of this Codified Agreement, the following order of
precedence shall apply:-

(a) the Clauses and Schedule A1;

(b) Schedules A2 to A14;

(c) the Service Definition Schedules and Schedules G6 and G12;

(d) Schedule A15;

(e) Schedule A16;

(f) all other Schedules except Schedule A17;

(g) CCDs and Schedule A17; and

(h) — CRDs.

102.5.2 In the event of any conflict or inconsistency in relation to Service Levels, the provisions of the

102.5.3

Clauses

Service Level Schedules shall prevail over those of the Service Definition Schedules and
Schedules A15, A16 and G6 (but not the Clauses or Schedules A1 to A14) to the extent of
such conflict or inconsistency.

For the avoidance of doubt, POCL acknowledges that a particular solution in Schedule A16
shall not be treated as being in conflict or inconsistent with any requirement in Schedule
A15, or the Service Definition Schedules or Schedule G6, merely because the solution
states that the requirement will be met in a particular form, manner, quantity, time or place.

CODIFIED AGREEMENT

102.5.4 “Working Documents” do not affect or introduce any contractual obligations between any of
the parties.

102.6 The Recitals are not legally binding, but are intended as a guide to the interpretation and
construction of this Codified Agreement.

102.7 Where this Codified Agreement imposes upon either party an obligation which was also
imposed on that party under the Authorities Agreement or POCL Agreement then to the
extent that such obligation has been performed under the Authorities Agreement or POCL
Agreement it shall be deemed to have been performed under the corresponding provision of
this Codified Agreement (but continuing obligations shall continue under this Codified
Agreement).

102.8 Where any provision of this Codified Agreement requires or permits a matter to be agreed
between the parties or approved by either of the parties and such provision was also
contained in the Authorities Agreement or POCL Agreement, any agreement reached or
approval given under the Authorities Agreement or POCL Agreement shall be deemed to
have been reached or given under the corresponding provision of this Codified Agreement.

102.9 References in CCDs, CRDs and Schedules agreed prior to the date of this Codified
Agreement to NR2 or NR2+ shall be construed so as to refer to such of CSR or CSR+ as
shall be appropriate having regard to the functionality of the item or service to which such
reference relates, as determined by the SADD and any relevant Release Contents
Description. Likewise, references in such CCDs, CRDs and Schedules to other items,
services or matters affected by subsequent agreements between the parties (including this
Codified Agreement) shall be construed to reflect most appropriately the effect of such
subsequent agreements.

102.10 Itis expressly agreed that Clause 201.6 and (notwithstanding that they refer to CCDs) the
definitions of “Core System” and “CSR+” shall take precedence over all other provisions of
this Codified Agreement (including the Schedules) which define the Core System, CSR+ the
Core System Services or the POCL Services other than the Network Banking Service and
the PIN Pad Implementation Service.

Clause 103. Severability

If any of the provisions of this Codified Agreement is judged to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
continuation in full force and effect of the remainder of them will not be prejudiced but such provision
shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary in the court's opinion to render such term or
provision enforceable, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced
accordingly, preserving to the fullest permissible extent the intent and agreements of the parties
herein set forth.

Clause 104. Law and Jurisdiction

104.1 This Codified Agreement shall be governed by and shall be interpreted in accordance with
English Law and, subject to Clause 807, the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of

disaster or an industrial dispute affecting a third party. Any act, event, omission,
happening or non-happening will only be considered Force Majeure if it is not
attributable to the wilful act, neglect or failure to take reasonable precautions of the
affected party, its agents or employees, and only if a substitute third party is not
reasonably available (having regard, without limitation, to the cost and quality of
such substitute) to perform the affected obligation. In no event shall any
fraudulent act or omission by any third party or party in relation to the POCL
Services for which the Contractor is liable under Clause 809.1 constitute a force

Neither party hereto shall in any circumstances be liable to the other party hereto
for any loss of any kind whatsoever including but not limited to any damages or
abatement of Charges whether directly or indirectly caused to or incurred by the
other party by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations
under this Codified Agreement which is due to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding

Agreement for the duration of such Force Majeure event. In the case of the
Contractor, the parties shall agree an orderly process for such continuation or
resumption of performance (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and the Contractor shall comply with such process. The Contractor shall
remain liable to perform the POCL Contingency Services, save where such POCL

brought against the Contractor to which Clause 805.2 may apply. The Contractor shall
reimburse POCL for all costs and expenses (including but not limited to legal costs and
disbursements on a solicitor and client basis) incurred in so doing.

POCL shall not make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the defence or settlement
of any claim, demand or action for infringement or alleged infringement of any Intellectual
Property Right to which Clause 805.1 may apply or any claim or demand made or action
brought against the Contractor to which Clause 805.2 may apply.

If a claim or demand is made or action brought to which Clause 805.1 may apply or in the
reasonable opinion of the Contractor is likely to be made or brought, the Contractor may at
its own expense either:

805.6.1 modify any or all of the Products or the POCL Services without reducing the
performance and functionality of the same, or substitute alternative products or
services of equivalent performance and functionality for any or all of the Products
or the POCL Services, so as to avoid the infringement or the alleged infringement
but without disrupting the performance of the POCL Services, provided that the
terms herein shall apply mutatis mutandis to such modified or substituted items or
services and such modified or substituted items shall be acceptable to POCL
(whether by passing any form of acceptance testing or otherwise), such
acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall reimburse POCL
all reasonable costs directly incurred by them; or

805.6.2 procure a licence to use the Products and POCL Services on terms which afford to
POCL no more extensive rights than those originally applicable hereunder and
which are acceptable to POCL and shall reimburse POCL all reasonable costs
directly incurred by it.

The foregoing provisions of this Clause 805 shall not apply insofar as any such claim or
demand or action is in respect of:

805.7.1 any use by or on behalf of POCL of the Products or POCL Services in combination
with any item not supplied or approved (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) by the Contractor where such use of the Products or POCL
Services directly gives rise to the claim, demand or action; or

805.7.2 any modification carried out by or on behalf of POCL to any item supplied by the
Contractor under this Codified Agreement if such modification is not authorised by
the Contractor in writing; or

805.7.3 any use by POCL of the Products or POCL Services in a manner not reasonably to
be inferred from the specification or requirements of POCL.

If the Contractor has availed itself of its rights to modify the Products or the POCL Services
or to supply substitute products or services pursuant to Clause 805.6.1 (or POCL has
unreasonably withheld its acceptance of such substitute products or services) or to procure a
licence under Clause 805.6.2 and such exercise of the said rights has avoided any claim,

demand or action for infringement or alleged infringement, or if POCL has unreasonably
withheld its acceptance of any items modified or substituted by the Contractor in accordance
with Clause 805.6, then the Contractor shall have no further liability thereafter under this
Clause 805 in respect of the said claim, demand or action.

805.9 If a modification or substitution in accordance with Clause 805.6.1 above is not possible so
as to avoid the infringement and the Contractor has been unable to procure a licence in
accordance with Clause 805.6.2, Clause 805.1 shall apply.

805.10 POCL hereby warrants and represents that any instructions given in relation to the
Contractor's use of any third party item supplied directly or indirectly by POCL shall not
cause the Contractor to infringe any third party's Intellectual Property Rights in such item.
POCL shall, to the extent reasonably possible, assign to the Contractor any indemnity in its
favour in relation to the Intellectual Property Rights in such third party items.

805.11 The foregoing states the entire liability of the Contractor with regard to the infringement of
any Intellectual Property Right by the use or possession of the Products by or on behalf of
POCL or in connection with the receipt of the POCL Services.

Clause 806. Remedies Cumulative

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Codified Agreement, all remedies available to the
Contractor or to POCL for breach of this Codified Agreement are cumulative and may be exercised
concurrently or separately and the exercise of any one remedy shall not be deemed an election of
such remedy to the exclusion of other remedies.

Clause 807. Dispute Resolution Procedure

Except to the extent that paragraph 6 of Schedule A11 requires otherwise, in the event of any
disagreement concerning the terms of, or arising under, this Codified Agreement, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to reach an amicable resolution of the matter in question, but in default of
resolution within a reasonable period either party may apply to the Courts of England & Wales for the
matter to be resolved in accordance with English law.

Clause 808. Injury to Persons; Loss of Property

808.1 Subject always to POCL’s proper observance of its obligations under this Clause, the
Contractor shall fully indemnify POCL in respect of any personal injury or loss of or damage
to Property incurred by POCL or its respective employees and authorised agents to the
extent that such personal injury or loss of Property is caused by any Default of the
Contractor, its employees or agents in connection with the performance or purported
performance of this Codified Agreement.

808.2 In the event of any claim or demand being made or action brought to which Clause 808.1
applies, the Contractor shall be promptly notified thereof and the Contractor shall at its own
expense conduct all negotiations for settlement of the same and any legal proceedings that
may arise therefrom. The Contractor shall consult with and pay due regard to the interests
(including the commercial interests of the Post Office Group and the public interest) and

where it is reasonable to do so, comply with such interests and views. POCL, its
employees and agents, shall at the request of the Contractor afford all reasonable
assistance for the purpose of contesting any such claim or demand or action and shall be
repaid any reasonable expense incurred in so doing and shall not make any admissions
which may be prejudicial to the defence of such claim or demand or action.

Clause 809. Liability
809.1.1 Subject to Clauses 809.2 and 809.3, the Contractor shall be liable for all losses and shall
