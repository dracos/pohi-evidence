Hello Janet. I received a direct phone call to my home phone from Mr Rudkin who told me - and
I just confirmed this when I called him a few moments ago - that he'd been “prompted” to do so
by Lee Castleton and Alan Bates. I've had several calls now with Michael and he seems (as do
both Lee and Alan) to be a highly credible, balanced, contributor. Michael has raised some very
interesting matters, the most important as yet being an assertion that there existed (and may
still exist) a Post Office Ltd facility in Berkshire where, in 2008, he witnessed POL employees
passing entries over branch accounts without the knowledge or approval of those branches’
SPMRs. POL has consistently denied that it has such powers. I've put it to POL and we'll see
what emerges. In the meantime, I'm in constant dialogue now with Michael and he seems to
have become satisfied that 2"4 Sight is not (as both he and Mr Bridgen at first suspected)
lacking in independence and ability to get to the truth. I'd be very pleased, therefore, to
receive Mr Bridgen’s ‘blessing’ to including Michael's case.

Best regards

Hi Ron,
You'll be working until death on these, I suspect!

Can you drop me a quick line letting me know how Mr Rudkin got in touch with you regarding his case? I just need a line
of explanation I can offer Mr Bridgen, who can then let us know formally whether or not you can go ahead.

Many thanks
