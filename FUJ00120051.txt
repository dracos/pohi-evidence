RMGA Customer Service Incident Management Process.

FUJITSU

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1. Introduction

1.1 Process Owner

The owners of this process are the Fujitsu HSD / SMC Operations Manager and the RMGA Service
Delivery Team Manager responsible for the Fujitsu contract.

1.2 Process Objective

The objective of this document is to define the process for Incident Management in the RMGA
environment. For the purpose of this document an Incident is defined as:

“Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may cause, an
interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.”

The quality of the service includes the protection of the confidentiality of business, personal and card data
as defined by the RMGA Information Security Policy (SVM/SEC/POL/0003).

This process applies to all Incidents raised by the RMGA HSD or by SMC (out of hours or from systems
monitoring tools), where they are related to the Fujitsu outsourcing contract. N.B calls presented to
RMGA HSD / SMC that should be placed with the NBSC are transferred/ referred from RMGA HSD /
SMC to NBSC.

The scope of the process is from the receipt of an incident by the HSD / SMC, through to the successful
workaround or resolution of the incident.

For clarity it should be noted that the HSD / IMT are responsible for managing/owning Incidents during
business hours, with SMC assume this responsibility out of hours.

1.3 Process Rationale

The primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal service operation as quickly
as possible, thereby minimising adverse impact to the business. In turn this ensures the highest level of
service quality and availability. Normal service operation is defined here as service operation within
Service Level Targets (SLT).

This process takes account of the requirements of improved service to be delivered to POL, through the
introduction of the HSD / SMC. The implementation of the IMT is documented and is aimed at delivering
improved understanding and communication between POL and RMGA leading to an increase in the
perceived service level within POL.

2 ‘Inputs

The inputs to this process are:

e All Incidents reported by Contact with the HSD / SMC. Contact is defined as voice or Tivoli Alert as
the methods of communication with the HSD / SMC and fall into the following categories:

°
°
°
°
°

Business process error

Hardware or software error

Request for information e.g. progress of a previously reported Incident
Network Error

Logging via HNG-X web interface

e Severity and SLT information.

e Evidence of an Error.

e System Alerts received automatically from OMDB. Due to the urgent nature of these alerts they will
be dealt with directly by SSC, with an update of workaround or resolution supplied to HSD / SMC. It
should be noted that these alerts enter the process at step 3, and are not subject to steps 1 & 2 of
this process.

Risks and Dependencies

3.1 Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation procedures.
Non-availability of the HSD / SMC Incident Management System or HSD / SMC ONE systems.
Mitigation is given in the HSD / SMC Business Continuity Plan.

Non-availability of the OTI links to core & external service desk tools.

Lack of information given to the HSD / SMC regarding changes, POL Business updates, request for
changes, status of Problems etc. Processes must be followed to lessen this risk, such as the
Change Management and Problem Management Processes.

Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff

Unavailability of sufficient tools for Incident diagnosis

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems

The provision of inadequate staff training within the HSD / SMC, SDU'’s or 3% party suppliers
Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering.

3.2 Dependencies

This process is dependent on:

Effective Incident handling by the HSD / SMC
The known error information being available and kept up to date with all errors as the root cause
becomes known to Problem Management

e Knowledge database (HSD / SMC ONE) kept up to date with POL business and services knowledge

e Fujitsu infrastructure support of the HSD / SMC tools

e Appropriate training plans / skills transfer of desk agents.

«Appropriate training needs to include hardware, software and networks support staff, SDU's and 3
party suppliers

e Effective routing of calls to SDUs and third parties

e Effective escalation procedures and the maintenance thereof within Fujitsu, POL and third parties

e Governance of Incident / Problem Management procedures

e Effective feedback to POL through Service Management ORFs, contributing to end user education
and reduced Incident rates.

e Internal feedback to improve the Incident / Management Process.

e SLT and OLA knowledge and understanding across all Fujitsu and 3 party support

«¢ RMGA, SDU and 3" party consistent co-operation in incident identification and resolution

1.2 The caller may be enquiring about an existing Incident. Details are provided and if the response
is satisfactory, contact is ended, moving the incident to step 5. If the caller is not satisfied with
the response, the relevant Escalation Procedure is invoked. In cases of Incidents that are either
taking an above average time (for this type of Incident) to resolve or involve multiple SDU's, the
HSD / SMC alerts the relevant Service Delivery Manager to provide focused management of the
Incident.

1.3 For a new Incident, Contact details are recorded if not system generated. Details taken are
dependent upon the error reported. Typically they may include:

The user's name and unique ID number

Location and contact details

Alternative contact details (where appropriate)

Hardware details as appropriate

Software error details, including application use at point of failure where known

Business and User Impact

Description of Incident

1.4 Classification of Call determined as one of the following:

e Error Incident — invoke Incident Management Process Step 2

¢ Quality — record details of complaint or compliment and invoke the relevant
Escalation Procedure.

e Advice & Guidance — Cold Transfer to NBSC.

e Out of scope - if the call is not within scope for the services provided by Fujitsu
advise the caller of the correct number or refer to POL NBSC and close incident.

1.5 The caller is advised of call reference number and the incident follows the process as
appropriate for the nature of the call

2.2 Call Severity is assigned based on the impact and urgency as per the criteria in the table below.
Call Priority for Hardware and Network calls is assigned in accordance with the Priority matrix
as detailed in Engineering Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0002), a copy of which each
agent should have on their desk.

central system failure which will result in a number of Post Offices being unable to
process work.

* Forensic Investigation required following a compromise of card data

B Major + BUSINESS RESTRICTED, a Post Office restricted in its ability to transact business,
e.g. one counter down

* — PCI Major Incident

c Medium +  NON-CRITICAL, a Post Office working normally but with a known disability, e.g. an
interim solution (workaround) has been provided.

* PCI Minor Incident

py) Tow + _ INTERNAL, an internal HSH/HIT/SMC problem, e.g. a Service Desk PC or a phone
set inoperable

2.3 If the incident is considered a Major Incident as defined in SVM/SDM/PRO/0001 Major Incident
Process, the Major Incident Procedures are invoked.

2.4 The HSD / SMC agent then attempts to resolve the Incident using the resources available.
This starts by interrogating HSD / SMC ONE to find all information related to the Incident
symptoms. If the Incident is routine, i.e. there is a predetermined route for resolution, then the
Incident is resolved on the call or referred to the relevant SDU using the HSD / SMC Support
Matrix in HSD / SMC ONE.

2.5 If the Incident is not routine, the HSD / SMC agent checks for Known Errors listed in HSD /
SMC ONE and the SSC KEL against records relating to the Incident symptoms. If a match is
found, the agent informs the caller of the workaround or resolution available

2.6 If there is no match in HSD / SMC ONE or the SSC KEL, the HSD / SMC Incident
Management System stack is checked for current incidents outstanding. If a match is made,
the caller is then advised of the status of the incident and the master record is updated to
reflect the current occurrence.

2.7 If no match is made against the HSD / SMC Incident Management System stack, the HSD /
SMC continues with first line resolution of the Incident assisted by the Product Support
Engineers (PSE's). IMT are appraised of the position.

2.8 If the PSE's cannot resolve the Incident, it is referred to the relevant SDU using the HSD /
SMC Support Matrix in HSD / SMC ONE. IMT are appraised of the position. For Hardware
calls, the caller is given an indication of engineer arrival time, based on the SLA associated
with the priority of the call.

5.2.3 Steps 3/4: Investigation and Diagnosis; Resolution and
Recovery

Responsible: SDU’s

2nd line support stage. The referred SDU investigates and diagnoses the Incident, based on
information already taken by the HSD / SMC, together with any new information. The SDU also
coordinates where sub-contract third parties are involved. If the Incident has no associated KEL, or
it is complex and involves multiple SDU’s, or if it has been unresolved for an extended period, the
IMT will alert the RMGA Service Delivery Manager to the existence of a pattern likely to produce a
Problem.

Out of hours, SMC should check the OLA documentation to determine if out of hours support is
available for the Service impacted. In the event that out of hours support is available, SMC will
discuss incidents with the Duty Manager, who in turn will discuss incidents with the line of business
SDM.

4.2 The SDU then either applies the workaround or resolution or passes it to the HSD / SMC to
implement. The Master Incident Record (if one exists) remains open at this point.

4.3 The SDU checks the workaround or resolution has been successful. HSD / SMC are
responsible for updating details recorded in HSD / SMC ONE, from details supplied via the
KEL created by SSC. HSD / SMC ONE should be identical to SSC KEL in relation to
Application Software, but may also contain additional information.

4.4 Where this Incident has a number of Calls referenced to it, or where there is a probability that
proactive action is required to prevent further occurrences of this Incident the IMT will alert the
RMGA SDM to the existence of a pattern likely to produce a Problem

4.5 The Incident is then passed to the HSD / SMC to manage the closure

5.2.5 Step 6: Ownership, Monitoring, Tracking and Communication
Responsible: HSD / SMC, SSC.

Throughout the Incident, the HSD / SMC retains ownership for monitoring and keeping the call raiser
informed of progress, unless the incident is specifically software related, in which case SSC hold the
responsibility for confirming details of closure.

The HSD / SMC manages the complete end-to-end Incident process.
Activities include:

e Regularly monitoring the status and progress towards resolution of all open Incidents

e Note Incidents that move between different specialist support groups, indicative of uncertainty
and possibly a dispute between support staff

* Give priority for Incident monitoring to high-impact Incidents

e Keep affected users informed of progress without waiting for them to call, thus creating a pro-
active profile

e Monitors SLT and escalates accordingly. If an Incident has no associated KEL or, it is complex
and involves multiple SDU's, or if it has been unresolved for an extended period, IMT will alert
the RMGA SDM to the existence of a pattern likely to produce a Problem.

e Updating HSD / SMC ONE from information supplied from SSC KEL. This may be applied as a
direct copy or amended for use by the agents, dependant upon the technical complexity of the

update.

9 Appendix A: Security Incident Reporting

9.1 Scope

This annex outlines the process regarding the investigation, and reporting of all security incidents
concerming the HORIZON Network and all IT equipment.

9.2 Aim

The aim of these instructions is to ensure that details of all IT related security incidents are reported to
one central point and that any follow up investigations are managed in an efficient and auditable manner.

9.3 Changes

These work instructions are primarily for use by HORIZON Service Desk Staff, the RMGA Security Team,
the POL Security Team, and SSC staff. Approval from POL is to be gained before any significant
changes to the work instructions are implemented. All readers are encouraged to propose changes to
Work Instructions, in writing, to the RMGA Security Manager.

All incident documentation is subject to review and update by the business continuity and information
security teams as part of the lessons learnt process following an incident and following the annual review
of the incident process as part of business continuity.

9.4 POL Incident Handling Guidance,

All POL incidents will still be handled in accordance with existing POL guidelines. This document does
not replace these, or, indeed, replace any part of the content - rather it lays down the RMGAccount
framework under which the work is carried out.

9.5 IT Incidents
9.5.1 Incident Definition

9.5.1.1 An information security Incident is: "an adverse event or series of events that compromises
the confidentiality, integrity or availability of Fujitsu Services Post Office Account information or
information technology assets, having an adverse impact on Fujitsu Services and/or Post Office Ltd
reputation, brand, performance or ability to meet its regulatory or legal obligations." This will also extend
to include assets entrusted to Fujitsu including data belonging to Post Office Ltd, its clients and its
customers.

9.5.2 Incident Categories

Incidents can be categorised in many ways, they can occur alone or in combination with other incident
categories and can vary significantly in severity and impact. It is important that all incidents are
recognised and acted upon.

RMGA Customer Service Incident Management Process.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

9.5.2.1 For the purpose of illustrating the impact of incidents two levels of severity have been defined
(Note: in practice the assessment may be less straightforward):

A MINOR incident will normally have limited and localised impact and be confined to one domain,
resulting in one or more of the following:

Loss or unauthorised disclosure of internal or sensitive material leading to minor
exposure, or minor damage of reputation

Loss of integrity within the system application or data, leading minimal damage of
reputation; minimal loss of customer / supplier / stakeholder confidence; negligible cost of
recovery

Loss of service availability within the domain, leading to reduced ability to conduct
business as usual; negligible loss of revenue; minimal loss of customer / supplier /
stakeholder confidence; negligible cost of recovery

Individual attempts to breach network security controls shall be treated as a minor
security breach.

Subject to discussions with the RMGA Duty manager due to high volume of calls relating
to the same type of incident it may well be a requirement to follow the RMGA Major
Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) following the advice from the RMGA Duty
Manager.

A MAJOR incident will have a significant impact on the Network Banking Automation Community
resulting in one of more of the following:

Loss or unauthorised disclosure of confidential or strictly confidential material, leading to
brand or reputation damage; legal action by employees, clients, customers, partners or
other external parties

Loss of integrity of the applications or data, leading to brand or reputation damage; loss
of customer / supplier / client confidence; cost of recovery

Loss of service availability for applications or communications networks, leading to an
inability to conduct business as usual; loss of revenue; loss of customer / supplier / client
confidence; cost of recovery

Aconcerted attempt or a successful breach of network security controls shall be treated
as a major security breach.

NB. For a Major Incident the RMGA Major Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) should be followed.

9.5.3. Examples of IT Incidents

Theft of IT equipment / property, including software
Malicious damage to IT equipment /property, including software
Theft or loss of Protectively Marked, caveat or sensitive IT Data.

Actual or suspected attacks on the Fujitsu Services RMGA Network or Information
System.

Potential compromise of systems or services at the Data Centre through evidence
retrieved and presented by Police or POL's card acquirer.

e Suspected Fraudulent Activity

e Specific compromise of card data.

The above list is examples, and by no means exhaustive. Any other IT related

incidents reported, will be considered and passed to the appropriate authority for
action.

9.5.4 Containment

Whenever an Incident is identified which presents a serious threat to conduct normal business it should
be contained and isolated as quickly as possible. This will mean Platforms that appear to have suffered
virus attack or other malicious code attack need to be quarantined immediately to prevent further spread.
It may also be necessary to isolate network connections that appear to be the source for Denial of
Service threats or where they have been subjected to suspected hacking attack.

If the incident relates to card data, the environment may be subject to a Forensic Investigation imposed
by POL's merchant acquirer. In this instance log data will need to be reviewed and analysed.

9.6 Reporting

9.6.1.1 Anyone reporting a security Incident should be encouraged to notify their Line Manager in the
first instance. The Line Manager will gather as much detail of the incident as possible, following company
procedures. He or she will undertake an initial local investigation into the incident, ensuring that in the
case of missing equipment or materials that they have not just been misplaced. Information gathered will
be entered into the initial case report template (ICR).

9.6.1.2 If the severity of the Incident is considered as Minor but warrants further investigation the
Line Manager should immediately log a call with the Horizon Service Desk, stating that they are reporting
a security incident, giving brief details. Please note that in certain cases there may be circumstances

where no details of a sensitive, nature should appear on the call log. Having logged the call and obtained
a call reference number, the Line Manager may then continue with the investigation, and act as a liaison
between the person reporting and all concerned parties. Once logged, the investigation will thereafter be
referred to by the Call Number.

9.6.1.3 All Incidents reported to the Service Desk with a call reference and even when classified as
Minor should still be forwarded to RMGA Security Management to determine if there is a Security Impact.
It is important that for any incident investigated the correct procedures are adopted regarding evidence,
as the information collected and recorded may be used for evidential purposes at a later date

9.6.1.4 If the severity of the Incident is considered as Major the Incident details must be reported
directly to the RMGA Security Manager immediately. Contact details are available on Café VIK.
Depending on the type of Incident and the severity of the incident RMGA Security will make the decision
to escalate the details to the POL Security. In the case of Data Centre incidents specifically Security will
also inform the Data Centre Manager if this has not already been done. Regardless of the severity of the
incident, when a compromise in card data occurs the incident must be reported to POL Security so that
POL can comply with it's contractual obligations with it's card acquirer.

9.6.1.5 In all cases relevant details should only be recorded and discussed as necessary between
the person investigating or Line Manager dealing with it and any relevant parties who need to be included
in the investigation. Information on any incident must not be passed to anyone who is not directly
involved with the investigation without the authority of RMGA Security Manager and the POL Head of
Information Security.

9.6.1.6 I Once a call is raised with the SSC the call will then be placed on the call stack of the RMGA
Security Team, who will monitor the incident, assist or advise the Line Manager if required, and be
available to take over the investigation should the need arise, but always be able to respond, within 2
hours of the initial call being made. (Minor Incidents (during normal working hours of between 9am and
5pm) and Major Incidents at all times.)

9.7 Investigation

9.7.1 Policy

Although all security incidents will initially be reported to the RMGA Security Manager in order to have
one point of contact for all parties, some or all of the investigation requirements may be passed to one or
more of the following for further action: The decision of delegation will be determined by the RMGA
Security Manager in association with POL Information Security Incident Manager.

9.7.2 POL Security / Investigation Team

9.7.2.1 In the event that the reporting of an incident is passed to POL Security or the Investigation
Team, all details of the investigation, and final outcome or reference details, should be recorded on the
initial case report (ICR) and details will be recorded in the security Incident Log. It is important that for any
incident investigated the correct procedures are adopted regarding evidence, as the information collected
and recorded may be used for evidential purposes at a later date.

9.7.2.2 In the event that the RMGA Security Manager takes ownership of an investigation, he will
report the results to POL Head of Information Security and POL's Business Continuity Manager..

9.7.2.3 During any investigation the Investigator must comply with the appropriate legislation and
compliance requirements and regulatory or standard requirements..

9.7.2.4 All initial investigations should be carried out at the earliest opportunity and any queries
should be directed to RMGA Security Manager. Investigation must be reliable, stand up to scrutiny and
potential cross-examination and evidence must be properly obtained, recorded and time stamped.

9.7.3 External Investigator

9.7.3.1 Should it be considered necessary the incident might be passed to an external Investigator or
forensics team, who will ensure that any data required for evidential purposes is captured and
investigated using a systematic approach which ensures that an auditable record of evidence is
maintained and can be retrieved. In some cases, where a compromise to card data is involved, two
Forensic Investigation teams may be involved. One team operating on behalf of POL gathering the
required audit logs to use to analyse and investigate the problem. A second Forensic Investigations team
may be imposed to investigate on behalf of the card acquirer and card schemes. In all incidences where
a Forensic Investigation is involved, the Forensic Investigators will be shadowed by POL's Legal and
Security Teams.

9.7.4 Evidence Rules

9.7.4.1 Rules of Evidence

Before undertaking security incident investigation and computer forensics it is essential that investigators
have a thorough understanding of the Rules of Evidence. The submission of evidence in any type of legal
proceedings generally amounts to a significant challenge, but when computers are involved the problems
are intensified. Special knowledge is needed to locate and collect evidence, and special care is required
to preserve and transport evidence. Evidence in computer crime cases differs from traditional forms of
evidence in as much as most computer related evidence is intangible and is in the form of electronic
pulse or magnetic charge, hence the need to use specialist teams. That said the information collected
and recorded from the Operational areas is equally important and must be recorded with due care and
diligence.

9.7.4.2 Types of Evidence

Many types of evidence can be offered in court to prove the truth of falsity of a given fact.
The most common forms of evidence are Direct, Real, Documentary and Demonstrative.
Direct Evidence

Direct evidence is oral testimony whereby the knowledge is obtained from any of the witness's five
senses and is in itself proof or disproof of a fact in issue. Direct evidence is called to prove a specific act
such as an eye witness statement.

Real Evidence

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

Real evidence also known as associative or physical evidence is made up of tangible evidence that
proves or disproves guilt. Physical evidence includes such things as tools used in the crime, and
perishable evidence capable of reproduction etc. The purpose of physical evidence is to link the suspect
to the scene of the crime. It is that evidence that has material existence and can be presented to the view
of the court and jury for consideration.

Documentary Evidence

Documentary evidence is presented to the court in forms of business records, manuals, printouts etc.
Much of the evidence submitted in a computer crime case is documentary evidence.

Demonstrative Evidence

Demonstrative evidence is evidence used to aid the jury. It may be in the form of a model, experiment,
chart or an illustration offered as proof.

9.7.5 Process

In most cases response to a reported incident the initial investigation will be carried out by a nominated
investigator normally the RMGA Security Manager or his nominated deputy. RMGA and POL Security
Teams will be on hand to provide backup and assistance if required. When seizing evidence from a
computer related crime the investigator will collect any and all physical evidence such as the personnel
computer, peripherals, notepads and documentation etc., in addition to computer generated evidence.

There are four types of Computer generated evidence they are:
e Visual Output on a monitor
e Printed evidence on a plotter
e Printed evidence on a printer

e Film recordings on such digital media as disc, USB stick, log files, tape or cartridge, and optical
representation on either CD or DVD.

The investigator will endeavour to obtain as much original evidence as possible. In the event of a court
appearance the court prefers the original evidence rather that a copy but will accept a duplicate if the
original is lost or destroyed or is in the possession of a third party who cannot be subpoenaed.

9.7.5.1 Following the initial investigation and where considered appropriate, the investigator will
report to/ liaise with the local Police and/or other external Agencies; this will only be done following
consultation with the POL Head of security and POL Head of Information Security or substitute.

9.7.5.2 Copies of the initial and follow up reports will be submitted to relevant authorities and details
of all investigations will be held on file by the RMGA Security to aid any subsequent trend analysis.

9.8 REMEDIAL ACTION

9.8.1. On Completion of report

When the final report of an investigation has been completed, it should be passed to the relevant
authority for follow up action, the results of which should be referred back to the RMGA Security
Manager.

9.8.2 Completion of Investigation

When an investigation is closed the RMGA Security Manager will ensure all details of the investigation
have been recorded and can be made available for subsequent future analysis.

9.8.3. UNIRAS Reporting

On call closure, the RMGA Security Team will complete and notify UNIRAS where required. Thereafter
the incident will be reviewed to identify the lessons learnt and the processes and relevant documentation
will be updated as appropriate.

9.9 TRENDS & AUDITING

9.9.1 Frequency

9.9.1.1 RMGA Security Team will carry out a monthly check of all investigations and create a
summary report highlighting all incidents to the POL Head of security.

9.9.1.2 The report will highlight any trends or weaknesses which may need to be raised at future
Security Forums.

9.9.1.3 Details from the monthly reports may also be considered suitable for Line Managers.
