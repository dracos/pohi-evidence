Ihave been employed as a counter clerk at Rugeley Post Office for the last 6 years and
was here at this office whilst Carl Page was the Postmaster. I was employed
throughout the period that Carl Page was the Postmaster and my main duty would be

to serve the customers on the counter.

Thad been shown how to perform the Bureau de change transactions and was able to
use the Forde Moneychanger to conduct such transactions, however, I never had to
change the exchange rates on the machine itself as someone else normally did this.
Although I did conduct bureau de change transactions these would be fairly infrequent

as Margaret or Jayn normally performed these transactions.
I was also aware of a customer called Mr Whitehouse who regularly come into Rugeley
Post Office to buy euros, usually large quantities of euros, however I have never

personally served Mr Whitehouse on the Bureau products

I was aware of the large amounts of euros purchased by Mr Whitehouse but I have

never queried this with Mr Page.

Tam employed by Post Office Ltd a part of the Royal Mail Group as an Inspector
working within the Security & Audit section and have been so employed for
approximately 11 years though have been employed by the Post Office for about 18

years.

The role of the audit team is to carry out routine audits of Post Office Branches in order

to carry out verification of cash and stock as well as conduct certain compliance checks.

On Thursday 27 June 2002, I was the Lead auditor and part of a team of four auditors
who attended Rugeley MSPO, 18 Anson Street, Rugeley WS15 2BF, the other members
of the team were Mr G Burrows, Mr S Roberts and Mr K Orgill.

Upon our arrival at the Post Office, I was informed by the officer in Charge, I believe
her name was Margaret, that the Postmaster, Mr Page had gone on Holiday at short
notice on Monday that week. It was also discovered that this lady only had clerk access
to the Horizon computer system and therefore there were certain reports and cash

accounts, which could not be produced by the officer in charge.

Continuation of statement of Robert Neil Davies

It soon became apparent that the accounting at the office was in a real mess and that
certain stock units had not been ‘rolled’ over in readiness for the new cash account
week and a thorough check of all the counter stocks had to be undertaken and rather
than performing a verification of cash and stock at the office it became a process of

actually performing the office balance.

On moving onto balancing the Bureau stock unit, we became aware that none of the
staff knew how to balance the Bureau stock and therefore it was explained to them how

to balance the Bureau stock.

There were problems with the Bureau stock in that the brought forward figure from the
previous week was around £30,000, with currency received that week of over £100,000
and travellers cheque sales of around £5,000 this meant the total should have been
around £135,000. There were also cheques on hand toa value over £200,000 which had
been remitted out to data central but were still in the office at the time of the audit, none
of the staff were able to explain why they were still in the office. When the Bureau

stock was finally balanced it showed a surplus of £191,192,95,

The main stock unit, which we were told was the Postmaster’s stock, was then
balanced. The initial horizon printout produced suggested that there should be some
£325,000 in cash in the main stock unit. When it was verified only about £181,000 in

cash could be located.

During the course of the audit the Postmaster did telephone the office on several
Occasions and as a result I was lead to believe that some of the cheques on hand had

been declared as cash against the main stock unit hence the difference in what we had

actually found.

Ultimately the main stock unit (AM) balanced showing a shortage of £145,873.74, which
meant that by taking the surplus of £191.192.95 away from the above figure left the
overall office balance with a surplus of £45,319.21, therefore we began to recheck the

bureau stock and the main stock again to try and identify the error.

It was then discovered that the Bureau stock was wrong, as the figure declared for the
sterling value of currency on hand from the Forde moneychanger to the Horizon
computer system was incorrect. The figure, which had been declared by the office,
indicated a sterling value of currency on hand as £82,772.85, however our physical
check showed that the sterling value of currency actually on hand was £29,487.39 and

when this was corrected it produced a shortage of £53,285.46 in the Bureau stock unit.

The cash account we produced showed a surplus of £191,192.95 and a shortage of
£145,923.64.

The declared shortage in the AM stock (main stock) of £145,873.74 and the declared
surplus of £191,192.95 in the Bureau stock were both transferred to the suspense

account, which gave a net surplus of £45,319.21.

Taking the shortage produced in the Bureau stock of £53,285.46 away from the above

surplus of £45,319.21 gave an overall shortage of £7,966.25 in the main stock unit and

adding to this the other small shortages and surpluses in the other counter stock units
the overall audit balance came to a shortage of £8,335.63, which the Postmaster was

informed should be made good as soon as possible,

The Bureau de Change part of the operation provides customers with foreign currency
and travellers cheques for which First Choice set a daily exchange rate for the selling of
and purchase of the various types of foreign currency. Our supplier of currency is
American Express and we apply different margins dependant on the location of our
outlets and offer price matching. The exchange rate, plus margin is to be used by our
staff when conducting such transactions with the ordinary members of the public. In
certain circumstances, if an individual wished to either purchase or sell a large amount
of foreign currency to us we would be able to negotiate a more favourable exchange
rate, though this would have to be approved by our Foreign Exchange support desk

who have access to the Bank rates and this is dane over the telephone.

Normally we work on a percentage profit for the general everyday transactions,
however with a very large transaction we would be able to lower that percentage and
still make a reasonable profit, this percentage would vary depending on the size of the

transaction.

of Mr Whitehouse carried out a transaction at the Holiday Hypermarket outlet in Fort
Dunlop on Tuesday 7 January 2003, at which time we bought 293,600 euros from him
at an exchange rate of 1.5625 which therefore equated to a sterling value of

£187,904.00, this amount was paid into his bank account by CHAPS.

The Bank exchange rate that day for the purchase of euros was 1.5468 and by applying
our margin, which is variable depending on jacation of the outlet, the normal exchange
rate we would have applied that day would have been about 1.6086, though we do not
have records to show this. I am able to confirm that the exchange rate provided to Mr
“Whitehouse had been negotiated by telephone to the outlet concemed on the day of
the transaction before the transaction actually took place. The outlet concerned would
contact our FX support desk and foreign exchange regional sales Manager to agree the

rate to be offered.

known reason for there to be two forms for that day and I can only assume that the
amount of euros was changed after the completion of the 4* large transaction form

possibly due to further euros having been produced by Mr Whitehouse.

Further records show that Mr Whitehouse had communicated with our Fort Dunlop
outlet on the morning of Monday 43" January 2003 enquiring about the best exchange
rate we could offer him, to buy euros from him, he suggested that he may have
between 400,000 to 700,000 euros for sale, the outlet advised Mr Whitehouse to come

into the branch to agree the purchase.

The bank rate that day was 1.5305 and working on the same principle as the
transaction on the 7°, which had a 1.01% margin, the rate Mr Whitehouse would
probably have been given on the 43" would have been about 1.5459, however this
transaction did not take place. The normal exchange rate we would have applied that

day would have been about 1.5917, though we do not have records to show this.
