POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF MICHAEL FRANCIS MATTHEWS

|, MICHAEL FRANCIS MATTHEWS, will say as follows;

1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 23 August 2023.

2. | have been assisted by Priyesh Patel of DAC Beachcroft LLP in the

preparation and drafting of my statement.

BACKGROUND

3. | ama former employee of Royal Mail Group and Post Office Ltd (‘POL’) and
have held several positions across Royal Mail Group Security (RMGS') but

the most notable two are as follows:

Page 1 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

a. Firstly between 2005 and 2007 | was a Financial Investigator in
training, then an Accredited Financial Investigator (AF) for POL; and

b. Secondly between 2007 and 2018 | was the Procedures and Standards
Manager in Royal Mail Letters Security (RMLS), which became RMGS,
after separation from POL. RMLS who as the biggest team in RUGS
undertook functions for the whole of RMGS Including the preparation of

Procedures and Standards.

Relevant background

4. Between 1980 and 1990 | served in the Army, the first 5 years in the Army
Catering Corps and the second 5 years in the Royal Military Police. In the
military police | carried out general military police duties which included minor

criminal investigations.

5. Between 1990 and 1997 | was an Assistant Investigation Officer (AIO), then
Investigation Officer (10) in the Post Office Investigation Department (POID)
and then the Post Office Security and Investigation Services (POSIS). During
this time | was mainly employed on Royal Mail Investigations but | also
occasionally undertook investigations into losses and suspected theft and

fraud at Post Offices.

6. Between 1997 and 2001 | was employed as a trainer in the POSIS Training
Wing. The POSIS Training Wing offered training to all Investigators and

Security Managers across the different Business units in Royal Mail, such as

Page 2 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

Royal Mail Letters, Post Office Ltd and Parcelforce Worldwide. My role was to
develop and deliver training courses to all Criminal Investigators employed by
RMGS which included POL Criminal Investigators. During this time | received
a NVQ level 3 in Training and Development from Croydon College and a NVQ
4 in assessing Investigations which | believe was from the POSIS Training

Wing as it was an accredited NVQ Assessor Centre.

. In about 1999 we started to prepare for a large recruitment of about 80
recruits into the Investigation role across the RMGS. In the past the initial
training was a five-week residential course for Royal Mail Investigators which
was extended to six weeks for POL. Under the new system Investigators were
allocated 15 open learning modules which they were to complete under the

supervision of their mentor/line manager.

. These open learning modules covered all the theory of an investigation up to
the end of the suspect interview. Delegates then attended a two-week
residential course where they underwent practical exercises such as witness
interviews, suspect approach, searching and suspect interviews. None of this
training covered Horizon as that was the responsibility of POL to train their
Criminal Investigators “on the job”. This would have been by a mixture of
observing criminal investigators conducting tasks and then actually

undertaking tasks under the supervision of an Investigator.

WITN09380100

9. From 2001 to 2005 | moved to POL. For a short period of time | assisted in

Casework Management and then became a Commercial Security Manager.
Casework Management involved checking casefiles to see what action should
be taken. For example, should they be forwarded to the Criminal Law Team
(‘CLT’) for advice on prosecution, returned to the investigator for further
inquiry or filed as it was not possible to solve the case or identify who may

have been responsible.

10. During this time | was the second officer to Ged Harbinson at an interview of

4

Ms Tracy Felstead at Peckham Police Station. This will be discussed later in
this statement. Ged Harbison was an Investigation Manager at the time
responsible for the criminal investigation into Ms Felstead. | knew him

because | trained him in 2000.

.After some time | took up the role of Commercial Security Manager. This

involved liaising with POL product managers, reconciliation teams at
Chesterfield, outside commercial companies and Law Enforcement Agencies
in an attempt to secure products (such as foreign currency, postal orders and
stamps) from fraudulent activity and theft mainly from non-POL suspects. My
main product responsibilities were Foreign Currency, Banking Products and
Postal Orders. My only involvement in Horizon during this period was to write
communications to Branch staff which appeared on Horizon. For example a
message that appeared on Horizon, before a counter clerk accepted an
American $100.00 bill for exchange, to check the security features to make

sure that the bill was not counterfeit.

WITN09380100

12.Between 2005 and 2007 | was a Financial Investigator in training to be an
Accredited Financial Investigator. | become accredited under the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002 by the relevant authority at the time, (Assets recovery
Agency). | was initially accredited to allow me to apply for Production orders
under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and subsequently accredited to apply
for Confiscation under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Being Accredited
earns a Business & Technology Educational Council Level 4 Qualification in

Financial Investigations.

13. Between 2007 and 2018 I become the Procedures and Standards Manager
for RMLS and later RMGS. My main responsibilities were to produce and
maintain Procedures and Standards (‘P&S’) for all Investigators across all the
different Business units. My role was explained to me by Ray Pratt as one
where the Senior Leadership Team would produce RMGS Policy which would
be high level and | would articulate what process were needed to be followed
to deliver the policy. Ray Pratt was my line manager and the Policy
Standards and Investigation Support Manager in Royal Mail Letters Security
(RMLS). The P&S were published on the Group Security Database to which
all RMGS Investigators (including POL) had access to. | do not know how the
Senior Leadership Team produced RMGS Policy. | was never present at any

meetings with the Senior Leadership Team where Policy was discussed.

14.1 do not know who in the Senior Leadership team produced Policy.

15.With the exception of explaining the process of how to obtain detailed

transaction data from Fujitsu, | cannot recall any of the P&S detailing how

Page 5 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

Horizon enquires were to be conducted. This was because this was the
responsibility of the POL Investigation Team which was a different business

unit to the one | worked in.

16. After some time, POL separated from RMGS completely. POL were able to
copy whatever P&S they wanted prior to separation and | had the task of
removing all irrelevant references to POL from the RMGS P&S.
Notwithstanding this at some time | produced the initial version of P&S 2.2
Joint Investigation Protocols RMGS and POL Security (Version 2 July 2015)
[POL00114559]. Procedures and Standards (P&S) should not be confused
with policies. | do not know who in POL decided which P&S they were going
to copy as | was in a different Business Unit (RMLS) at the time and no longer
had any responsibility for POL. | unable to comment on or whether the P&S
were copied directly, or whether any amendments were made, or by whom as

| was not a part of the copying process within POL.

17.When | had delivered the Set of P&S on the RMGS database, | also got
involved in training again. One of the Courses | delivered was a course on
preparing Trial papers including disclosure and this was based on a Royal
Mail casefile. | believe this was after separation and so POL Investigators did
not attend as at this time RMGS was a completely different business and my

course may have been delivered after Royal Mail Privatisation.

18.Between 2018 and 2019 | was the RMGS Helpdesk Manager following which

| took voluntary redundancy.

Page 6 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

19.1 have been asked how | became an Internal Crime Operations Manager. To
clarify, whilst | was with POL | was a Financial Investigator rather than a
Criminal Investigator. | was a commercial Security Manager on Joining POL in
2001 until 2005. In 2005 there was a reorganisation and | was appointed to a
newly created role of Financial Investigator with the view of becoming an
Accredited Financial Investigator (AF1). | never carried out any criminal
Investigations in POL (save second officer for Ms Felstead) or attended
Branches or audit for an investigation. | have never been responsible for a

criminal Investigation in POL whilst Horizon was in place.

20.With regard to training and relevant experience and expertise | undertook and
obtained Accreditation from the Assets Recovery Agency and became an AFI
but | would say | was very inexperienced. | was accredited under Part 2
Confiscation and Part 8 Investigation of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002

(POCA 2002’).

21.My main role was to Identify a suspect's "benefit from crime" and then try to
identify “realisable assets” In order to prepare for potential Confiscation
Hearings under POCA 2002. Confiscation can only happen after a suspect
has been convicted of a crime from which they have benefitted. Normally
proceedings would not be commenced unless the benefit was more than
£5,000.00. This was a general rule with confiscation in the courts rather than

POL.

22.My Line Manager was Tony Utting | recall he was Head of Internal Crime at

POL.

Page 7 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

23.With regard to my colleagues | thought that my colleagues and managers

were both competent and professional.

24.1 was never an Internal Crime Operations Manager or Investigations Manager.
They were responsible for the investigation into the suspected criminal
offence. | was responsible for the conduct of the confiscation investigation.
Confiscation Proceedings at Court should only happen after conviction where

the defendant has benefited from criminal conduct.

25.1 had no role in disciplinary matters as the line manager of the person to be
disciplined was responsible for conducting discipline in accordance with

procedures in place at the time.

26.1 only interviewed one individual in relation to a Horizon shortage and that was
Tracy Felstead where | acted as second officer. | believed it was my role to
establish the truth of the matter, whether this pointed to innocence or guilt, in
accordance with the law in the case . With regard to interviewing a Suspect
that would have been in accordance with the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984 and their Codes of Practice . Apart from that interview | did not
interview any suspects following the introduction of Horizon. As my role during

the Horizon period held no responsibility to interview suspects.

27.Disclosure in Criminal Proceedings was to be conducted in accordance with
the Criminal Procedures and Investigation Act 1996 Codes of Practice. Each

Investigator would have been issued with a copy of the Codes of Practice and

Page 8 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

they were subsequently available on the relevant RMGS databases to which
all Investigators had access. The fundamental principles are that anything that
would harm the prosecution or aid the defence must be disclosed to the
defence and all reasonable lines of inquiry should be pursued. | cannot recall
being involved in civil proceedings. Whilst conducting Financial/Confiscation
Investigations we kept a Policy Log which recorded policy decisions and
Event log which recorded all events in the case and a Document Schedule
listing all the documents in the case. | am sure these were revealed to CLT. If
we did come across anything that needed disclosure before any trial | would

have informed CLT.

28.1 believe that whilst conducting confiscation investigations | pursued all

reasonable lines of inquiry.

29.1 had no knowledge of Civil Litigation strategy, that would have been the

responsibility of the Civil Litigation Team in Legal Services.

30. With regard to Liaising with other Post Office departments | only ever liaised

with the Criminal Law Team on the progress of cases.

The Security team’s role in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions

31.To the best of my recollection soon after | joined the POL security team in
2001 the team was organised into 3 Teams or “strands”. The largest team
dealt with Criminal Investigations. A second team dealt with procedural and
physical security on an operational day to day basis. The third team dealt with

Commercial Security and Technical Security. | think that team looked at new
Page 9 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

technology (such as alarms systems, smart water and cash carrying

systems).

32.In 2005 there was a reorganisation and that was when | was appointed to
Financial Investigator working in the Internal Crime Team. | think the teams
stayed much the same with a reduction in Senior Managers | cannot recall if

the number of Investigators was reduced.

33.In respect of "Royal Mail Group Security - Procedures & Standards - The
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 & Financial Investigations" (version 1, September
2010) [POL00026573] - | authored this P&S and | would have sought Input
from Ged Harbinson. The P&S would then have been agreed my Line
Manager Ray Pratt (deceased) and CLT before publishing. | think this was the
first version of this document. | am sure | would have sought input from Ged
Harbinson as he was an AFI at the time. | would have used the training
material and the knowledge that | had received whilst in training and from
being an AFI. Prior to being published it would have been submitted to Ray

Pratt and CLT for assurance.

34. Ray Pratt was the Policy Standards and Investigation Support Manager in
Royal Mail Letters Security (RMLS). As RMLS were the biggest team of
investigators within RMGS they tended to take responsibility for central roles
such as Procedures and Standards (P&S) and the provision of equipment.

Ray Pratt was responsible for standards and compliance in RMLS and he

Page 10 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

wanted a comprehensive set of P&S for his investigators to follow. | was told

that the P&S were to be useable by POL but my priority was RMLS.

35.In respect of "Royal Mail Group Security - Procedures & Standards - Initiating
Investigations" (September 2010) [POL00104857]. | would have authored this
document using historic documents and existing custom and practice. When |
first joined there was an Investigators Staff Manual in hard copy. Over
reorganisations this manual was not updated and a Group Security Database
was created. Changes in the law such as Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act 2000 and changers to lines of responsibility required such P&S to be
reviewed and updated. Again, it would have been assured by the Ray Pratt

and CLT before publishing.

36. In respect of:
a. "Conduct of Criminal Investigations Policy" (version 0.2, 29 August
2013) [POL00031005];
b. "Conduct of Criminal Investigations Policy" (version 3, 10 February
2014) [POL00027863]; and
c. "Conduct of Criminal Investigations Policy" (September 2018)

[POL00030902].

37.1 did not draft these documents and | believe they were produced after POL
separated from, RMGS, but | can recognise some “lifts” from RMGS P&S. For
example, General Rules for the Use of Notebooks.

38.In respect of, “Post Office Ltd PNC Security Operating Procedures” (August

2012) [POL00105229], | did not have any part in the management or

Page 11 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

development of this document and it was in all probability written around the
time of separation. RMGS did have a PNC Manager who produced P&S and |

suspect this is the source of the information in this document.

39.1 did not have any part in the management or development of "POL —

Enforcement & Prosecution Policy" ([POL00104968]).

40.1 have been asked about the Security Team’s role in relation to criminal
investigations and prosecutions and | confirm | had no part in development or
management of the following documents:

LEGISLATION

Page 13 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

41.All legislation that covered criminal investigations governed the conduct of
Investigations in POL. The main ones were Police and Criminal Investigation
Act 1984, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 Criminal Procedure and Investigation
Act 1996, Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. RMGS also allowed a
“friend” at interviews and Post Office Young people were treated differently

until they had reached 18 years old.

POLICES

42.1 was not in POL post-separation | was in RMGS and had no part in the
development of their investigation policies. Notwithstanding they were able to
copy RMGS P&S prior to separation. | did develop RMGS P&S as detailed in

my answer to question 26 below but | had no part at all in POL Policy.

43.With regard to Post Office policy and practice regarding investigation and
prosecution of Crown Office employees differing from the policy and practice
regarding investigation and prosecution of SPMs, | was not aware of any
difference between policy and practice regarding investigation and

prosecution of SPMs and their managers and assistants.

COMPLAINTS

44. If the complaint happened in a custody suite at a police station it would be
reported to the custody sergeant and as soon as practicable a Senior
Investigation Manager (SIM) within RMGS. If it was not in a custody suite it
would be reported to a SIM as soon as practicable. A SIM who was out of the

direct reporting line would Investigate the complaint. POL while part of RMGS
Page 14 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

would have followed the same procedure. After separation | have no

knowledge of what their complaints procedure was.

45.If a complaint was made by member of staff or SPM they could approach their
Union or the Federation of Subpostmasters. Suspects were informed of their
right to have a friend present at a voluntary interview who could be a union or
federation representative. When in custody the custody sergeant was

responsible for ensuring the rights of the suspect.

SUPERVISION

46. Every investigator had a line manager. Line managers were supposed to have
regular one to ones with their direct reports where cases and caseloads were
discussed. The frequency of 121s changed during my time at Royal Mail as
sometimes it was monthly and other times as required. Records were kept
and action points would be agreed for discussion at the next 121. These
action points may well have included what action was to be taken in specific

cases.

Audit and investigation

47.1 have not seen the document entitled “Condensed Guide for Audit
Attendance” (version 2, October 2008) [POL00104821] prior to this witness
statement request and have not had a part in its production. | have never
attended a Horizon shortage Investigation audit. As such | have considered

the document and all | can say is that an investigator would attend if

Page 15 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

criminality was suspected and the loss met trigger points. The investigator's

role would be to investigate suspected criminality.

48.Where a shortfall was identified following an audit of a Post Office branch, the
SIM or investigation team leaders decided whether the matter was suitable for
a criminal Investigation based on a Trigger Point Document. | do not think it
changed unless a new trigger point document was produced. | cannot expand
on this as | cannot recall what was in the trigger document. | do not think that
the local contract manager had any input into the decision whether or not as
case was to be to criminally investigated, that was based on trigger points. The
local contract/appropriate line manager did however at one point make the

decision on whether to prosecute or not.

49.1 cannot recall what the triggers were for raising a fraud case following the
identification of a shortfall / discrepancy in a branch nor can | recall if they

changed.

The process followed by Security team investigators

50.1 did not conduct any Criminal Investigations following the introduction of
Horizon (Save being a second officer with Ms Tracy Felstead in | believe
2001). | think they would have acted in accordance with regard to legislation

and Post Office P&S.

51.Whilst working in POID in the 1990s, | investigated a few cash losses and

Pension and Allowance Fraud cases at Post Offices. | think the system was

Page 16 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

called ECCO but the evidence was paper based. My main responsibilities

however during this time-was Royal Mail Letter investigation cases.

Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings

52. Following an initial investigation, a file would be submitted to the CLT. They
would assess the evidence and decide if there was sufficient evidence to
prosecute and whether it was in the public interest. | believe they followed the

Code for Crown Prosecutors.

53. Initially a Manager in Suspect Offenders line management made the decision
on prosecution, subsequently it was a senior Human Resources Manager.

Finally, | think the decision went to the Head of Internal Crime team.

54. The Head of Internal Crime could challenge a decision of the Prosecution
Decision Maker if they did not agree with the decision. The Prosecution
Decision Maker was the Manager with POL who after considering the written
advice of the CLT would decide if a prosecution should be undertaken. |
cannot recall any instances when the Head of internal Crime changed a
prosecution decision. My recollection is that when | initially joined POL in 2001
the teams were set up geographically with Regional Managers responsible for
both Investigation and Security. Soon after | joined this changed to three
strands with one being Internal Crime. The Head of Internal Crime at this time
was Phil Gerrish. He then subsequently moved to RMLS and Tony Utting

became the Head of Internal Crime. | left POL in 2007. | cannot remember

Page 17 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

who became the Head of Internal Crime POL after | left but it may have been

Dave Pardoe or John Bigley.

55.1 was not a party to the process of making the prosecution and charging
decisions and so cannot say what test would have been applied, but |

understand it was in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.

56. In terms of advice, legal or otherwise, | am only able to say that CLT would
give written advice on cases where summons was to be obtained or verbal
advice on charges if a person was to be charged at a police station. They
were also available to give advice over the telephone if an Investigator

required advice.

57.With respect to internal and external advice, when | worked for POL the initial
advice was always from the internal CLT. As the Case progressed agents
would prosecute on behalf of POL and if the case went to Crown Court, then
counsel would be used. Our agents were lawyers, usually based outside of
London and the Southeast who prosecuted cases at Magistrates court on
behalf of Royal Mail to keep the costs down. Agents were always different in

different areas. | cannot remember any specific names.

58.1 was not aware of a particular approach being applied to cases where a

shortfall was identified on audit.

Page 18 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

59.To apply for a Restraint Order the decision would have to have been taken
that a Confiscation Investigation was appropriate. For a Restraint Order to be
granted we would have to demonstrate to the Crown Court Judge that the
application was necessary and proportionate. Normally the necessary criteria
was Satisfied by there being information/suspicion that the assets would be
dissipated, reducing the amount available for a Confiscation Order. An AFI
may well conclude that a restraint order was appropriate but | understand that
before they can apply for one it has to be authorised by a Senior Authorising

Officer under POCA.

60. With respect to criminal enforcement proceedings, the Prosecution Decision

Maker made the decision on prosecution.

61.1 discussed potential financial investigations with my Line Manager Tony
Utting, Head of Internal Crime. | would look at most cases where there was a
significant loss to see if there were assets available to satisfy a potential

Confiscation Proceedings.

Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security team

62. Initial training consisted of theory sessions followed by a practical training role
play. All Investigators were made aware of the fact they were required to have
regard for the relevant PACE 1984 COP and given copies. Following the initial
training courses, new Investigators were to be supervised by a mentor/line

manager for an extended period while they learned on the job.

Page 19 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

63. There was an Investigator’s Staff Manual which became electronic Policies,
Procedures and Standards. Any changes to Investigation practice were
communicated by Investigation Circulars which were initially manually

circulated but then were emailed to all relevant Investigators.

64.1 would add that whilst | was involved in training and P&S | would liaise with or
search for publications from the College of Policing and/or the Home Office.
Such a publication would the Home Office publication “Achieving Best

Evidence” manual in order to inform the training and P&S.

65.At some later refresher training was given where the PEACE module was

taught.

66. With regard to witness statements, initial training consisted of theory sessions
followed by practical training role play following which they would have been
guided by mentors/line managers. Additionally there were P&S dealing with

obtaining witness statements.

67.On the issue of conducting searches, following the murder of Andrew Gardner
on a house search in 1997 the whole issue of search was risk assessed and
reviewed. Most Investigators then attended a search course delivered by

Metropolitan Police

68.1 then produced the search training for the new investigators joining in 2000.
This training was based PACE 1984 Codes of Practice the Police Training
and my experience of search during my career. The emphasis being the

preservation of evidence and health and safety.
Page 20 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

69.1 do not recall specific training on the duty of an investigator to investigate a
case carefully. That would have been for the Casework Manager, Line
Managers or even CLT to instruct or train the investigator. An investigator
should have been aware of the CP&l 1996 COP which states Investigators
should pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry, whether these point towards or

away from the suspect.

70.With regard to obtaining evidence, initial training included theory on the types

of evidence and how it should be secured.

71.1 do not recall any specific training on the circumstances in which evidence
should be sought from third parties who might hold relevant evidence, outside

of obtaining any type of evidence from any witness.

72.When the CP&l Act 1996 came into force investigators received training from
CLT on disclosure obligations. All Investigators were issued with the CP&l
Codes of Practice. New investigators covered the subject on a Prosecution

Process Course.

73.On drafting investigation reports, although Investigators did write a report on a
mock case during training they would be guided by their mentors/line
managers. There would have been a written guide either in a P&S or the older
Investigators manual. Additionally, Investigators sourced previous reports

from experienced Investigators and used them as a guide.

Page 21 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

74.When | started in P&S in 2007 there had been a lot of change in RMGS over
the previous years and it was thought that the existing P&S were not fit for
purpose. So, | was instructed by my Line Manager Ray Pratt, Policy Standard
and Investigation Support Manager to produce a set of P&S for the Group
Security Database. It was explained to me that the Senior Lead Team would
be responsible for high level policy and these documents would be kept short.
| was to produce Procedures and Standards which went into more detail than
the Policy documents and detailed how investigators did things. | was also to

set up a review programme.

75. The way | produced P&S was to obtain all source information from the
following:

the College of Policing’s Legal Services. It provided updates

e. | would also consult specific team members had more knowledge, for
example on Health and Safety | would consult Allison Angus as she
has a NEBOSH certificate. Or David Brassington who was the lead of
the Digital Forensic Team. This was a team which copied computer

76. The drafted P&S were then forwarded to my relevant line manager and the

CLT for assurance and sign off.

77.The review programme was that core activities such as 7.4 Interviewing
Suspects [POL00104867] would be undertaken annually or whenever
information came forward requiring an immediate change. Others such as 7.7
Obtaining Fingerprints and Handwriting Samples [POL00104871] may have
been left to be reviewed every other year or whenever information came

forward requiring an immediate change.

79.Most of the P&S bear the Royal Mail Cruciform (later versions contain the
Branding of “Royal Mail Group) at the top of the document. When | started to

separation of RM and POL | was told by Ray Pratt that the P&S were to be

reproduced in the Royal Mail Branding and references to POL were to be

removed. | understood this had been agreed with Senior Management. The

RM Versions were to start again with Version 1.

It is my understanding that the P&S 2.2 Joint Investigation Protocols - RMGS
and POL Ltd Security (Version 2, July 2015) [POL00114559] was written
because of the separation between RMG and POL as the Security teams no
longer had a working relationship. When | first joined POID all investigators
helped each other. Then as the Business Units separated, they each
conducted their own criminal investigations. As time when on the business
units grew apart as they had different responsibilities and ultimately this led to

there no longer being a working relationship.

.In respect of P&S Appendix 1 to P&S 9.1 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002

Investigation Orders (January 2019) [POL00124167] and Appendix 2 to P&S
9.1 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 Enforcement Receivership Orders (January
2019) [POL00124168] appear to be P&S that | authored with Ged Harbinson

AFI and which has subsequently been copied and rebranded by POL.

Finally on P&S, with the exception of writing in the P&S 2.2 Joint Investigation
Protocols - RMGS and POL (the first version was written in July 2014)
Security Version 2 July 2015 [POL00114559] on how RMGS Investigators
obtain Horizon data from POL, | cannot recall ever writing anything about how
to obtain evidence from Horizon as | was not working in POL and POL was a
different business unit. They would have been responsible for their specific

individual business requirements.

Analysing Horizon data and requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu

83.1 have been asked to consider the following documents:

a. The document entitled “Conducting Audit Data Extractions at CSR”
dated 4 May 2000 at [POL00029169];

b. The document entitled “Conducting Audit Data Extractions at Live”
dated 27 November 2001 at [FUJ00152176];

c. The versions of the document entitled “Management of the Litigation
Support Service” dated 27 October 2009 ([FUJ00152212)]), 14
February 2012 ([FUJ00152220]) and 23 April 2012 ([FUJ00152225)),
as well as the version marked “withdrawn” at [FUJ00152235];

d. The versions of the document entitled “Audit Data Extraction Process”
dated 13 September 2010 ([FUJ00152216]), 1 March 2011
([FUJ00152218]), 14 February 2012, ([FUJ00152221]), 3 September
2014 ([FUJ00152226]) and 4 September 2014 ([FUJ00152228]);

e. v) The document entitled “Security Management Service: Service
Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0017) dated 24 August 2006
([FUJ00002033]), 31 December 2008 ([FUJ00080107]), 15 October
2010 ([FUJ00002264]), 25 November 2013 ([FUJ00088868)]), 4
December 2013 ([FUJ00002555]), 4 April 2014 ([POL00002572]) and

19 February 2016 ([POL00002666}) (and in particular, paragraph 2.4).

84.1 was aware that Fujitsu maintained very detailed transaction data, but | was
not aware of any analysis that investigators carried out. | have never applied
for any data from Fujitsu and | cannot recall ever seeing any. | had no

requirement to see the data. My work was reliant on a conviction. | did not

Page 27 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

believe the Horizon data would show me the benefit from the crime | thought
the audit shortage showed me that and additionally it would not identify any

realisable assets.

85. With regard to audit data, an agreed amount of data was available in
accordance with the contract but when a certain amount had been obtained
there was a cost involved. | understand all key stroke data was available but |
do not recall who told me this. My understanding of key stroke data is that
every time a key on the keyboard/screen is touched an entry is made on
Horizon and the data was recorded. The significance of this for me was that
Horizon was able to show on balancing what cash on hand figures were
entered by the SPM before Horizon detailed what figure was required to
balance. When a Post Office Branch completes a weekly or later a monthly
balance the branch has to input into Horizon what cash and stock they have
on hand. Once these figures are entered, Horizon would then tell the branch if

they are short, over or whether they are in balance.

86. If a branch is short they can then resubmit the cash on hand and increase the
amount of cash on hand by the amount the system told them they were short
by. This would then mean that the branch showed a balance although in fact

they are short of cash.

87.1 do not know the limits or how the ARQ requests above contractual limits

were dealt with or charged.

Page 28 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

88.1 do not know of any changes between Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online

apart from to say the initial Horizon was not in real time “online”. It "polled"
data and updated regularly, whereas the Horizon online was that and in real

time.

89. My role in respect of obtaining audit data was limited to what | wrote in a P&S

2.2 Joint Investigation Protocols - RMGS and POL Ltd Security (Version 2,
July 2015) [POL00114559] and Version 1 was produced on July 2014.
Namely, if Royal Mail Investigators needed Horizon Transaction data it was
only available from Fujitsu and that would be at a cost. There was less
comprehensive Credence data available from POL at no cost. In order to
obtain the data an application had to be made to Paul Ackroyd who was the
Disclosure and Acquisition Manager RMGS. | do not know what Credence

data was but assumed it was data available directly to POL.

90.1 have no knowledge of issues such as ARQ request authorisations or

91.

provision of data by Fujitsu as this did not form part of my duties or
responsibilities nor did | have any contact with Fujitsu or anyone connected

with Fujitsu such as Gareth Jenkins.

In terms of prosecution support, | understood that Fujitsu were asked to
provide statements and transaction data. After providing a statement they
may be required to give evidence as any other witness would but | am not
aware of any prosecution support they were contractually obliged to provide. |

think it was normal for them to provide statement if the case went to court.

WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

92.1 do not know whether ARQ data was requested as matter of course in
circumstances where a shortfall had been identified. | conducted financial
Investigations and | do not believe the ARQ data would assist in the
Confiscation process. My view was that where ARQ data was obtained it

should rightly be disclosed to the SPM.

93. If | had ever needed an expert witness, | would have sought advice from the

CLT as that was their area of expertise.

Relationship with others

94.1 have never had any contact any one from with Cartwright King Solicitors. |

think these Solicitors were instructed after | had left POL in 2007.

95.1 understood that Mr Hughie Noel Thomas was a representative of the
National Federation of Sub-postmasters but aside from my contact with him |
have never had any contact with any one from with National Federation of

Sub-postmasters that | am aware of.

Prosecution of Ms Adedayo

96.1 am asked to consider:
a. an investigation report [POL00044360];
b. the record of the Ms Adedayo’s interview [POL00066742] (part 1) and
[POL00066745] (part 2);
c. the memo dated 15 September 2005 [POL00064797];

d. the memo dated 6 October 2005 [POL00044361];

e. the memo dated 27 January 2006 [POL00052911];

f. the memo dated 6 March 2006 [POL00044362];

g. my letter to Ms Adedayo on 8 March 2006 [POL00052588];

h. the financial investigation policy log [POL00030561];

i. the section 16 statement [POL00044370];

j. the Financial Investigation Document Schedule [POL00047865]; and

k. the memo dated 5 October 2006 [POL00052907].

97.1 was asked by the CLT to prepare a Section 16 POCA 2002 Confiscation
Statement [POL00044370]. | also understand these were the first
Confiscation proceedings that Royal Mail had undertaken, but | cannot recall
anything which is not in the documents listed above or my attendance at
Maidstone Crown Court. | would add that the documents detail that Ms
Adedayo explained that she had borrowed the money to pay a family member

for some of the loss.

98.Prior to the Ms Adedayo case, apart from interviewing Tracy Felstead in 2001
| would only have been involved in financial investigations, | did not undertake
any criminal Investigations into losses involving Horizon. The financial
Investigation would not have involved looking at Horizon Data as this would

have been the responsibility of the criminal investigator.

99.1 had no involvement in the initial investigation, the decision to charge or the

decision to prosecute in the Adedayo case.

Page 31 of 49
WITNO09380100

WITNO09380100

100. | cannot recall any allegations made by Ms Adedayo relating to the

reliability of the Horizon IT system prior to the Confiscation proceedings.
101. | understand Natasha Bernard was the Criminal Investigator in the

case, but | cannot recall any assistance | gave her. My work was the

confiscation investigation and | would run my cases alone.
102. In terms of legal assistance | would have liaised with the CLT but

cannot remember any further details.
103. | cannot recall the sources of evidence but | would have looked at the

casefile and spoken with the investigator. The casefile would have contained
the evidence and statements in the case and any relevant intelligence. This

would have been prepared by Natasha Bernard.

104. With regard to confiscation proceedings in respect of Ms Adedayo |
produced a Section 16 POCA 2002 Confiscation Statement [POL00044370]
and gave evidence at Maidstone Crown Court - where my evidence related to
figures in the confiscation statement - apart from that | have no further

recollection.

105. | do not recall any discussions with anyone with regard to the Adedayo

case, but | would have spoken with the CLT.

Page 32 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

106. After confiscation | cannot recall any further involvement in the

Adedayo case.

107. At the time | believed that | acted wholly correctly in endeavouring to
recover public funds. POL at the time was being subsidised by the
government. Any loss was a direct loss to public funds so | believed it was
important to recover them from those criminally liable for the loss. | am not
sure if it was policy, but it would have been the mindset of the investigation

team and CLT.

108. If she is a victim of unexplained losses, then | am very sorry for the
profound effect this has had on her life. | would not have had any part of

Confiscation proceedings on innocent people had | known.

109. | was led to believe that the Horizon Computer System was the most
secure non-military computer in the country. This was because the
Government could not tolerate benefits not being paid as this could lead to

civil unrest. | cannot however remember the source of this statement.

110. During my time in POL | never doubted the Horizon data | thought the
problem was with the SPMs. | believe that the mindset of most of my

colleagues was that Horizon was infallible.

Prosecution of Mr Hughie Noel Thomas

111. | have been asked to consider:

112. | very little recollection of this case or the documents listed above, but
once | became aware of the case | would have discussed it with my Line

manager Tony Utting.

113. Apart from going to Carnarvon Crown Court for one of the hearings as |
was told to attend by CLT. I cannot add anything to the documents regarding

this case.

114. | would have been aware of any allegations made against Horizon by
Mr Thomas because | would have read the case documentation, nevertheless
| believed in the integrity of the Horizon. Accordingly, | would have thought the

money had been taken from the branch.

115. | would have spoken with the Criminal Investigator in the case Dianne
Matthews for case information, but | cannot recall any conversations.
Additionally, | cannot recall if | spoke with Michael Mayall about the payment

of Mr Thomas' pension.

116. In terms of legal advice | would have spoken with CLT and their agents
as they had conduct of the prosecution, but | cannot remember any

conversations or discussion with specific individuals.

Page 35 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

117. | cannot recall the decision to apply for a Restraint Order aside from my
witness statement of 7 November 2006 in support of the application for a
Restraint Order [POL00044873] upon which it would seem there was

information that assets were being dissipated.

118. | do not recall who asked me to provide a witness statement in support

of the application.

119. At the time | believed that | acted wholly correctly in endeavouring to
recover public funds. POL have accepted that this was an unexplained loss
and more importantly the Court of Appeal has quashed Mr Thomas’
conviction. | am very sorry for the profound effect this has had on his life. |
would not have had any part of confiscation proceedings of innocent people

had | known.

120. With regard to the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Josephine
Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited and my reflections on how the case
against Mr Thomas was conducted by the Post Office. | believe that too much
trust was placed into the integrity of Horizon and we put more faith in Horizon
than we did in Mr Thomas. | do not know if examining the Horizon data would
have identified the problem and prevented all this. Too many assumptions
about the infallibility of Horizon were made and | apologise for my part in Mr
Thomas profound experience. | hope he gets the compensation he deserves

and lives the rest of his life in peace.

Page 36 of 49
121.

WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

The mindset of people | dealt with was that Horizon was infallible and

as such the assumption was that it must be someone at the branch who was

responsible for the loss.

Prosecution of Ms Janet Skinner

122.

| have been asked to consider the following documents:

. An interim report dated 22 June 2006 [POL00044624];

. Instructions to counsel to settle the indictment [POL00048356];
. The summary of Ms Skinner’s interview [POL00047357];

123. | have very little recollection of the Skinner case or the documents
detailed above. However, once | became aware of the case | would have

discussed it with my Line manager Tony Utting.

124. Apart from attending Hull Crown Court | have no recollection of the
Confiscation Investigation and cannot add anything to the documents relating

to this case.

125. | would have spoken with the Criminal Investigator in the case Dianne

Matthews for case information, but | cannot recall any conversations.

126. Additionally, | would have spoken with the CLT and their agents as
they had conduct of the prosecution, but | cannot remember any

conversations with CLT or any other specific individuals.

127. | cannot recall sources of evidence but it they have been intelligence

checks and personal financial documents.

Page 38 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

128. | cannot remember the adjournment application in this case but |
considered that her benefit from the crime was the money that she was short
on in addition to the increase in the value of money. This was because sub-
postmaster's were contractually liable as Sub-postmasters for any losses in
their branch, however they were caused. This was in accordance with the
contract sub-postmasters signed with POL on commencing as sub-

postmaster.

129. | would have been the AFI in the case so | would have had had

conduct of the case, but | have no specific recollections.

130. As with Mr Thomas, too much trust was placed into the integrity of
Horizon, and we put more faith in Horizon than we did in Ms Skinner. | do not
know if examining the Horizon data would have identified the problem and
prevented all this. Too many assumptions were made, and | apologise for my
part in Ms Skinners profound experience. | hope she gets the compensation

she deserves and lives the rest of her life in peace.

General

131. | left POL in 2007. Up until this time the assumption was that Horizon

data was to be trusted.

132. As soon as it was thought that the Data Integrity was not trustworthy
and | am not sure when that was, then a full Investigation should have been

mounted to identify the issues and this should have been disclosed to all

Page 39 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

persons convicted/adversely effected by unexplained Horizon losses. | would
imagine that the responsibility of the accuracy of the Horizon data was Fujitsu.

| do not know why the accuracy was not challenged.

133. | have no knowledge of investigations into bug errors and defects, so |
am unable to give a view of the sufficiency of POL's investigation or the

sufficiency of Fujitsu passing information to POL on bug and errors.

134. On reflection | am sorry to all those who have been adversely and
profoundly affected by these unexplained losses. POL should have done
more to ensure the rights of individual people as soon as they knew that

Horizon was affected by bugs errors and defects.

OTHER MATTERS

135. | was the second officer during the interview of Tracy Felstead a
Peckham Police Station Ged Harbinson was the Criminal Investigator in the

case.

136. In the judgement of the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton and
others V Post Office Limited 2021 EWCA Crim 577 at [POL00113278], at
paragraphs 185 and 186 the interview at Peckham police station is

commented on.

137. If | recollect correctly, | believe | asked the question “Can you

demonstrated how you did not steal the money? “. | am acutely aware that a

Page 40 of 49
WITNO09380100
WITN09380100

suspect does not have to prove their innocence. Ms Felstead was also asked
questions about whether her family had driven her to steal. The reason for this
is that | seem to recollect that the information we had is that Ms Felstead had
been on an expensive family holiday and | was trying to establish where the
funds had come from. The questions were probably spur of the moment to
keep interview going. The interview was tape recorded and | do not think I
breached PACE 1984 Codes of Practice. It certainly was not raised at the

time, and | believe she was represented at interview by a solicitor.

138. If, however | was overzealous | apologise to Ms Felstead. At the time |
would have thought that it was my duty to robustly question suspects to get to

the truth of the matter.

139. Notwithstanding as with Mr Thomas and Ms Skinner too much trust
was placed into the integrity of Horizon, and we put more faith in Horizon than
we did in Ms Felstead. | do not know if examining the Horizon data would
have identified the problem and prevented all this. | apologise for my part in
Ms Flesteads profound experience. | hope she gets the compensation she

deserves and lives the rest of her life in peace.

140. | believe that the facts contained in this witness statement are true.

Signed:

Date: 9 October 2023
