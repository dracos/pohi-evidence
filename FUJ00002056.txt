1 Summary

This document describes the procedure to calculate the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) for each
component of hardware within the Branch Infrastructure as deployed within Branches.

The document describes:
eHow the initial MTBFs have been calculated for the contract baseline at 31 March 2006;

e The procedure for calculating and validating the changes in the MTBF rate throughout the
term of the contract.

2 Definition and Process

2.1 Baseline MTBF

The following formula has been used to create a baseline MTBF at 31 March 2006 for each component
within the Branch Infrastructure. This baseline comprises the total number of failures and the average
number of installed units from April 2005 to March 2006. Appendix 1 of this CCD shows the actual data
used.

Baseline MTBFs have not been compiled in respect of:
. Optoma Flatscreens due to the lack of data for this component;

. Satellite base units due to the low and reducing number of installed units.

2.2 MTBF formula

For each component within the Branch Infrastructure, the MTBF is calculated as follows:
MTBF = L/N - expressed in years

where:
N = Total number of failures during the preceding twelve month period

L = Average number of units installed in the live environment in the same twelve month period

2.2.1 Number of failures

Components within the Branch Infrastructure that have failed and been replaced by a Support Engineer
are recorded on two systems:

e the FMS Configuration Management System
e the HSD Call Management Service

2.2.1.1. FMS Configuration Management Service

Whilst in attendance at the Branch, the Support Engineer will signify that a spare has been used. This
information will be forwarded to the FMS Configuration Management System.

Data from the FMS Configuration Management System will be extracted and used in MTBF calculations.

2.2.1.2 HSD Call Management Service

In accordance with information received from FMS, the HSD will allocate the PowerHelp Repair Code
R01 to signify that a component has been replaced.

Data from the HSD PowerHelp Management Service may be used to verify the FMS data if required.
Post Office have web access to incidents logged within the PowerHelp Management Service using the
standard dial up facility already in place. The procedure for extracting the relevant data from PowerHelp
is detailed in Appendix 2.

2.2.2 I Number of units installed

The number of units installed in the live environment is recorded on two systems:
e the Service Management Database (SMDB)
e the FMS Configuration Management System

2.2.2.1 SMDB

The SMDB records the number of base units installed in the live environment. The number of units
installed in the live environment is obtained or derived from SMDB data as follows:

1. Base units
Number of installed units taken from the SMDB.
2. Bar code readers, PINpads, Counter printers

Number of installed units assumed to equal the total number of base units taken from the
SMDB.

3. Keyboards, Monitors

Number of installed units assumed to equal the number of non mobile base units taken from the
SMDB.

4. Back office printers

Number of installed units assumed to equal the number of Gateway base units taken from the
SMDB.

2.2.2.2 FMS Configuration Management Service

The FMS Configuration Management System records the number of hardware components in the live
environment using information provided by Support Engineers. This data is used to break down the
Monitor and Back office printer figures further into components e.g. Epson printers, OKI printers.

2.2.3 Adjustments to base data

Fujitsu Services may apply adjustments to the base data to account for known problems within the
Branch Infrastructure which may cause spurious fluctuations and should be ignored for the purpose of
forecasting changes. For example, failures due to software upgrades or the replacement of existing
components with new products.

2.3. MTBF procedure

The following steps shall be followed:

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

1. Data relating to the number of failures and number of installed units is compiled on a monthly
basis.

2. MTBF is calculated on a rolling twelve month basis. Using the initial data which has been used
to derive the baseline (see Appendix 1), this spreadsheet will be populated on a monthly basis
and the revised MTBF calculated at the end of each month using the past 12 months data. For
example, the April 2006 MTBF will be calculated using data from May 2005 to April 2006. The
percentage change against the March 2006 MTBF will then be calculated.

3. Adjustments agreed between the Parties shall be applied to cater for unusual circumstances. All
adjustments will be detailed in the MTBF calculation and agreed as part of the monthly
validation process.

4. Using the resultant adjusted data, for each hardware component within the Branch Infrastructure,
the MTBF shall be calculated using the formula described in 2.2.

2.4 MTBF validation

Fujitsu Services will provide Post Office with data relating to the total number of failures and the number
of installed units at the end of each month.

Fujitsu Services shall provide Post Office with a calculation of the MTBF each month and compare with
the contract baseline MTBF and the annual change in MTBF.

Should Post Office wish to dispute any calculation, Fujitsu Services and Post Office shall complete a
review of the figures and agree the MTBF calculation which is to be taken forward. Such agreement shall
not to be unreasonably withheld by either party.

3 Supporting and Calculating Service Level
Performance and Liquidated Damages

The MTBF calculations will be used for forecasts and setting targets as defined in ‘Engineering Service:
Service Description’ [Ref. SVM/SDM/SD/0002] and ‘Branch Network: Service Description’ [Ref.
SVM/SDM/SD/0011]. The extent to which Fujitsu Services will cover engineering costs associated with
supporting the Branch Infrastructure or be entitled to SLT relief and to recovery from Post Office due to
MTBF degradation is defined in paragraph 3.3 of Contract Schedule B3.4 of the Agreement.

4 Post Office / Fujitsu Services Interfaces

The MTBF calculations will be validated on a monthly basis by Fujitsu Services: POA Service Delivery
and Post Office: Operations Support

Appendix 2 Procedure for extracting data from PowerHelp

From the PowerHelp Web Tools screen select the ‘live’ database.

2. On the next menu select the ‘Call search’ option.
3. The next screen will be the call search screen. It is here where criteria is selected to bring back
desired call results. Call volume totals or itemised calls can be extracted from the database.
4. From the PowerHelp call search screen select the following options for the following criteria.
Note the if any criteria is not specified then the default value is used, usually “All”
¢ Status: “Closed”
e Closed date: Select appropriate dates to match those calls listed in the FMS data
e Repair code: “R01”
5. Select the following output options at the bottom of the search screen:
¢ “Output list header”
¢ “Hide output parameters’
¢ “csv output’
¢ “Call Number”
e “Product ID’.
e Other output fields can be selected, however those mentioned are the minimum needed.
6. Once the results are returned from the Tool bar menu select File; Save as; (Rename file as
appropriate); and save as file type “text”.
7. Open this new file. Some editing of this will be needed to remove the words ‘Call List’ before the
first Open quote of the first call number. Once removed save and close.
8. Open this text file with Excel.
9. Select the “Delimited” option on the import Wizard (step 1), select “Comma” on step two of the
Wizard, and select “Finish” on the third step of the import Wizard.
10. Once completed the spreadsheet will be easily manipulated through filtering or sorting to provide
the amount of units replaced per hardware item.
