POLB 13/101 PRESENTATION BY THE BRANCH MANAGER CAMDEN HIGH
STREET

(a) Timothy Warley gave a presentation on the opportunities and
challenges of running Camden High Street Branch. He explained
his involvement in the changes in the Branch and the challenge of
leading the team. He recognised the changes in the Business since
many of his team had joined and the need to support their
development, but found the performance management tools
available cumbersome. His vision was for the branch to be more
customer-focussed with additional automation, lower staffing levels
and a drive to get rid of paper.

(b) The Board asked what could be done to ensure the right people
leave through redundancy and performance management. The
CEO explained that the current redundancy exercise was voluntary
but that she had starled a piece of visioning work with the CWU to
look at a 2020 Crown Branch and challenge all the staffing
agreements and procedures.

(c) The Board thanked Sharon Bull, Timothy Warley and Andrew
Thompson for their presentation and they left the meeting.

POLB 13/102 INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS UPDATE

(a) Tom Moran joined the meeting and gave an oral update on the
current position regarding Industrial Relations.

(b) He explained that the CWU had cancelled their Royal Mail strike
scheduled for Monday 4" November after an improved offer from
RMG. The Post Office strike was still scheduled to go ahead
although talks still continued. The Business could not afford to
move towards a similar offer to that made by Royal Mail.

(c) Tom Moran explained the two areas of visioning underway with the

POL0000052
POL00021519
POL00021519

CWU: to find a redundancy solution which exits the right people
from the Business and introduces more effective performance
management; and to trial a new branch mode! outside the existing
staffing arrangements. The Business and CWU would work
together to run a number of offices which had been earmarked as
franchise branches to see if they can be made to breakeven
without a change of ownership.

(d) Tom Moran reported that 18 of the targeted 35 franchise branches
had now been announced and were in consultation with more
announcements expected over the coming weeks.

(e) Tom Moran left the meeting.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UPDATE

The Board received the financial performance update for
September 2013, the 2013-2014 Q2 full year forecast and the
2014-2015 Budget look-ahead.

The CFO explained that the expected recovery in the second half
of the year meant that the EBIT target looked secure, but his
concern was that the revenue and exit rate trajectory for revenue
growth would not be at the level required to hit next year's targets.
The Board asked for a detailed report as part of the financial report
tracking the second half of the year with more detail on costs.

The Board recognised the need to grow the revenue and agreed
that any EBIT upsides should be reinvested on activity which would
drive current year revenue back to the £900m target. The CFO
reported that he had tasked the commercial/sales teams with
closing the gap.

The CFO was asked to include two measures for Network
Conversions on the scorecard showing ‘network conversions’ and
‘contracts signed’.

The Board noted the Network Transformation scorecard and the
income decline for locals and asked for a note to the Board in
November to explain trend.

The CFO explained the £40m budget gap for 2014/15 and the need
to implement the cost reduction activities necessary. A more
detailed budget debate would come to the January Board.
