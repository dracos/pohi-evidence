Rob,

1am forwarding you the attachments above in relation to a series of incidents, identified by Fujitsu this
week, whereby it appears that when posting discrepancies to the local suspense, these amounts simply
disappear at branch level, and a balance is shown.

The above includes Fujitsu's initial analysis and proposed solution/s, whilst the other documents the
outputs from various meetings held this week. My concern is around the proposed solution/s, one or more
of which may have repercussions in any future prosecution cases and on the integrity of the Horizon
Online system:

There is a further dial-in meeting this afternoon at 3:00pm — 3:30pm should you wish to attend or failing

that, as | know this is very short notice, if there are any comments/questions you would like me to offer on
your behalf please drop me a note. The meeting details are as follows:
