Dear Gerry

Thank you for your email about your constituent who alleges she was a victim of the Horizon system. I
thought it would be helpful to set out the background to this issue.

In 2012 Post Office appointed external investigators — forensic accountants Second Sight — to examine
allegations about the integrity of the computer system raised by some postmasters. The allegations
included that some postmasters had been wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting.

This independent review found no evidence of system-wide problems with Horizon and this fact remains
despite further investigation of individual cases.

The review findings were published in a report in July 2013. The Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme
was one of a number of commitments Post Office announced in response to the report, as an avenue for
postmasters to put forward their concerns. The Scheme was designed jointly with Second Sight and the
Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, who represent some of the postmasters and is led by a former
postmaster. The Scheme’s working group is chaired by a former Court of Appeal judge, Sir Tony Hooper.
Post Office, JFSA and Second Sight are all represented.

Both Post Office and the JFSA advertised the Scheme to postmasters — and employees — over several
months in 2013.

The Scheme is now closed to new applicants. However, an ex-sub postmaster, who did not hear about the
scheme at the time it was advertised, and would like their case investigated, can raise any concerns direct

POL00150364

with Post Office at any time. If your constituent is happy for you to do so, do forward me their details and
we can make some enquiries about the case.

I hope this is helpful. Please do not hesitate to let me know if I can provide any further information.
Kind regards

Jane

Dear Jane

I have been contacted by a constituent who is a former sub-postmistress. She alleges that she was the victim of
mistakes made by the Horizon IT system, which resulted in her having to wrongly repay over £17,000 to the Post
Office.

I know there has been a lot of media coverage about this issue over the last few weeks, and there is a debate on the
Mediation Service in Westminster Hall later today.

I would be grateful if you could outline for me what the process is for my constituent to make an application to the
Mediation Service to look at her specific case.

Kind Regards
