Statement of Andrew Paul Dunks

Age if under 18 over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18')

This statement (consisting of 7 pages each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and belief
and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully
stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe true.

Signature A Dunks

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services (Fujitsu), Post Office Account, since 11 March 2002
as an IT Security Analyst where I am involved in IT Security for the Post Office Account. I have
a working knowledge of the computer system Known as Horizon, which is a computerised
accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised by Fujitsu to undertake extractions
of audit data held on the Horizon system and to obtain information regarding system

transaction information processed on the Horizon system.

I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.
Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to the business of
Fujitsu. These were compiled during the ordinary course of business from information supplied
by persons who have or may reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of the
matter dealt with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the
information or cannot be traced, since the nature of the helpdesk involves many engineers all
at differing levels and any number could be involved in a particular call. As part of my duties, I
have access to these records, but I was not involved with any of the technical aspects of these
calls. This area is not my particular area of expertise and I make this witness statement simply
to help clarify the call logs for the benefit of the Court.

An important element of the support provided to sub-postmasters and Counter Clerks is the
Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). The HSH is the Horizon user's first ‘port of call’ in the event of

system were to malfunction, upon discovery the Horizon users (i.e. the sub-postmaster or

run by Fujitsu Services for the Post Office. I have been asked to provide details and
