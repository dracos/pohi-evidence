Dear All

Dear all

Further to the Board paper circulated last week, I confirm that tomorrow (Tuesday) we will
implement the plans to bring the Working Group to a close and will give notice of termination to
Second Sight.

We have today sent the attached letter to Jo Swinson with a view to a Ministers Written
Statement being tabled tomorrow.

The timetable tomorrow includes:

¢ Meeting with Second Sight at 10 am at which we will give them notice of termination

¢ While this meeting is underway, the press notice will be released (this is a simplified
version of the Jo Swinson letter) and the POL report (draft executive summary of which
is attached) will be released

e Following this, there is a programme of communications to all stakeholders including
parliamentarians, the Chairman of the BIS Select committee, Federation of Sub-
Postmasters, JFSA, Sir Anthony Hooper (he was briefed on Friday), CWU, Unite, and
letters going to all Applicants.

Our objective is to keep the messaging as neutral and low key as possible. Mark Davis and his
team are lined up to manage any media or other commentary.

We will provide a further update later in the week on the reaction to this announcement.
