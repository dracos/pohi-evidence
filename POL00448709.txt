Criminal cases: Appeals in the pipeline

1.

At the time of writing, the total number of overturned historical convictions remains at
83; this figure includes one CPS prosecuted case and one Northern Ireland case
prosecuted by the Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland (“PPSNI”). The opposed
case in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division is due to be heard on 21% December 2022
with written judgment expected in early 2023.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission (“CCRC”) have referred a further case to the
Crown Court. At the time of writing, POL is awaiting senior Counsel's advice on the case,

but POL’s internal criminal counsel has —
(RRS The CCRC are currently considering 26 further cases.

The PPSNI has received a further appeal that it has informed POL it will not contest. The
first hearing is on 14‘" December 2023 where the matter is likely to be adjourned until the
new year when it will be conceded. PPSNI continues to oppose one appeal which is listed
for hearing on 13" January 2023.

In November the Scottish Criminal Convictions Review Commission (“SCCRC") referred 6
cases to the High Court in Scotland. POL did not prosecute these cases and has offered
support to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal’s Service (“COPFS”) in respect of these
referrals. No court dates have yet been set and POL is due to speak to COPFS before the
new year.

The PFA Triage process designed to look at material POL has that may indicate a Horizon
case continues and is due to complete reviews at the end of February 2023. This is a delay
of approximately one month due to difficulties searching for newly identified material. 552
cases are to be reviewed and so far approximately 12% of cases reviewed have been
identified as cases POL might concede. HMC has taken the decision not to inform these
individuals immediately so that all cases can be reviewed fairly and the risk of
inconsistency of approach is significantly reduced. POL has started planning the
operational roll out of the results of the PFA triage.

Criminal: MET Police

6.

POL continues to co-operate with the MET Police who have now responded to POL’s last
correspondence. It is anticipated that a meeting between POL and the MET will have taken
place in December before POL formally responds. It is further anticipated that the MET will
start seeking production orders in the Crown Court, early in 2023.
