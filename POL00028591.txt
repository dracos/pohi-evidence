POCL SERVICE MANAGEMENT

1 Introduction

This report is produced by the POCL Service Management team and provides a high level “in-flight” assessment of any
threats to overall business continuity in the Congo 4 live service environment. The primary purpose is to identify any issues
(actual or potential) that might threaten the Congo 4 roll-out or regression from ICL Pathway services. It should be noted
that this report may have an operational bias.

For ease of reference, the report utilises a traffic light system with the following keys -

Overall there are no major threats to business continuity, however the ‘lost transaction’ trend continues which is the key
reason for the ‘BPS and Transaction Processing’ domains being on ‘amber’ status. The priority 1 level assigned to these
problems has focussed the contractor towards actively addressing POCL concerns and providing remedial action.

5.1

Benefit Payment System

Lost Transactions (LT)

A baseline has been introduced this month to regularly indicate current levels of LT in an easily readable form. This has
been carried out to reflect TP and Service Management concerns. These concerns are that current levels, while presently
manageable, may not be acceptable to the business when large volumes of encashments are returned by newly
automating post offices. LT indicate, when extrapolated (for BES only), volumes that may be startling in the live
service. It is worth noting however, that caution needs to be excercised when viewing raw figures as there may be
variables and arguments that might effect extrapolations.

Radical improvements need to be made now and the ways that this can be achieved are being formulated by Service
Management and ICL Pathway.

Baseline for LT
To provide an easy baseline against which LT can be assessed. Figures have been produced to show the volume of LT

per 10,000 encashments returned on an adjusted monthly basis and secondly a target figure of lost transactions that
POCL should be aiming to receive prior to the advent of Live Trial.

Current month level of LT per 10,000 encashments received 4.0
Target level of LT per 10,000 encashments received 0.26

5.2 Transaction Processing & ICL Pathway Interface
Lost Transactions (LT)
The report this month includes a comment from TP (Kevin Lenihan) to refocus attention on their continuing concerns.
“Whilst I accept that ICL Pathway need to balance time spent resolving the problem of lost transactions, against
development of Release 2, it remains a serious issue for POCL. Whether these problems are system or conformance

related, the point remains - we need to know and have assurance from Pathway that a similar situation will not occur in
Release 2. The level of confidence in the new system could rapidly be undermined if lost transaction problems increase

in line with volume at current levels. This would not only result in operational problems, but also effect the service
provided to customers, clients and our staff / postmasters. The need to isolate the cause of lost transactions must
therefore remain paramount.”

Fraud & Security

Authentication of Users to Helpdesks - One Shot Passwords

For Release 2, agreement on a procedure is imminent. Forecast closure is July 1998.

A review of the temporary procedure for urgent short notice requests from users for One Shot Passwords is to be carried
out.

Accounting & Reconciliation

Appendix ‘A’ details an agreed summary of accounting & reconciliation for the May period.

Definitions for the purpose of this report.

POCL SERVICE MANAGEMENT

A payment is the Child Benefit allowance money due for one week, or for four weeks (in the case of a four- weekly
allowance).

An encashment is a measure of the work effort in a customer session from the clerk accepting the payment card to
returning the card with monies, i.e. one customer is paid all due Child Benefit allowance. Thus, a customer may save
several payments before visiting their PO. During such a transaction there will be one encashment of several payments.

6.2 Volumes of BES transactions

These fell sharply this period. Figures imply that the cause of volumes falling was due to customers foregoing encashment of
benefits whilst away from their home outlet and taking advantage of schools breaking up for the second of the May bank holiday

breaks.

The number of expiries is currently 1.1% of the number of

over April is the result of a backlog of expiries being returned *
this May. The cause was due to problems with counter
procedures which did not return expiries automatically to
CAPS. A CP has been raised to automate this process in
future.
