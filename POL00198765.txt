 Belinda
 After much thought I asked our Senior Counsel to provide clarification to the number of points you raised below
 with regards to Para.4 of his advice copy attached.

 Thanks Jarnail
 This is very helpful and does, I think, clarify the position very helpfully.
 Just one question of further clarification from me:
 In para 4 iii the note says?

 iii. That protection would not be available to an organisation which conducted its prosecutions â€žin-house", that is, in
 POL"s case, using lawyers employed directly by POL.

 Am I right in interpreting this as meaning that as Post Office does not conduct its prosecutions in house - that is, it
 uses Cartwright King rather than directly employed lawyers - any claim for malicious prosecution would properly
                                                                                                                                                         POLOO198765
                                                                                                                                                       POLOO198765




 stand against Cartwright King and not POL, provided we follow our normal processes as described in the advice.

 I realise the danger of trying to paraphrase the advice for the purpose of clarification but I found the wording in 4 iii
 (that is, couching the point in terms of the protection 'not' being available) left me grappling with negatives so I want
 make sure I am absolutely clear.



 I am copying David Oliver who actually drafted the Board paper for Chris and will also copy him the note from
 Cartwright King, pointing out that it is subject to LPP.
 Best wishes

 Having read Bond Dickinsons note about potential civil risks to POL,I was concerned that the likely hood of action
 being brought had not been assessed.
 Accordingly I asked Cartwright King to review Bond Dickinson note. I attach senior Counsel Simon Clarkes response
 which clarifys the issues.
