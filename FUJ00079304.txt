Sorry. My mistake. I should read it more carefully!

At 4.3.4 and 4.6.2, the transaction date and time are not
strictly required

since the transaction Id will identify the transaction, which
already contains

the date and time. I had deliberatley not included the
transaction detail in

this message because of the potential for exceeding the
Riposte Max Message

length. The Transaction Id will enable the message to be
extracted and viewed

if necessary. For the time being (Version 0.8) I've left the
Date and Time in

and have removed the reference to the message content from 4.6.2.

agree that the original message should not be copied in to the Exception that is generated at the
counter, and agree with your attri bute grammar, however as far as the TPS Oracle table is concerned, I
propose that when the “Exception” is harvested, the harvester will attempt to read in the referenced
message and insert it into the TPS table. My point was that the Transaction time is "suspect" (given
that some of our past bugs have been due to missing transaction times), and we should leave it to BSU to
do what ever analysis they can from the Riposte message that they are passed. The only fields we should
be passing into the TPS Exception table are those that we can guarantee to provide.
