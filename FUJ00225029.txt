2 JUNE REVIEW OF SERVICE
2.1 Management Summary

SLA achievement for June (with respect to inbound DFD for Day "B") was slightly disappointing due to operational issues with Campus
failover tests and the Network Banking release activities. These issues will be addressed.

There has been a number of joint activities with Post Office Ltd. The End to End Service Management initiative is progressing well and it is
hoped that the joint service proposition will be completed in early August. SPOC 2 discussions are also progressing extremely well with a
tentative go-live date in late September. There has been less substantial progress on the configuration and change management activities
where we are still trying to drive out the business problems and resulting requirements.

There has been a significant amount of effort from both organisations in establishing service and cost reduction options for contract renewal.
These have been input into the current Heads of Agreement discussions.

The Service Improvement Plan regarding OBC performance is progressing extremely well and we are confident we will see a significant
improvement in this service

Finally, a key success for the Operational Security team in the month was the successful outcome of the Camberwell Green fraud case. The
evidence produced from Pathway and the subsequent appearance by Graham Hooper as an expert witness was a key factor in the successful
prosecution.

2.1.1 OBC

June has continued to see progress within OBC. The May workshop action points are being progressed. A follow up review has agreed
Terms of Reference for the OBC Network Operational Review Forum. Comments have been received on the three service documents, and
these are planned to be issued for approval in Mid-June.

The draft OLA has been completely re-written and has now been issued for further review.

The introduction of Energis On-Line has not yet been achieved due to resourcing issues in Energis; it is now planned for the third week of
July. The resourcing issues in Energis also contributed to disappointing installation figures in June, as a number of ISDN line orders were
placed late with BT. This has been escalated to director level within Energis, and a rectification plan initiated.

An internal review has been conducted into the level of manual intervention required to support the OCMS configuration tool. A formal cross-
domain problem has now been opened, and internal CPs are in production to tackle the primary areas of concern.

OBC invoicing is now being completed monthly, with full charging information being provided.
2.1.2 IMPLEMENTATION TAIL

The two outstanding sites, Isle of Rhum and Papa Stour, have now both been installed. The Implementation tail is therefore now complete.

2.1.3 AUTOMATED PAYMENTS SERVICE
Connections

20 Client interfaces — 8 are new connections (not ex HAPS), 1 suspended in June (SPM)

packages. These are applied to the gateway only and then distributed by a separate
package to the slaves. In addition, a counter can be upgraded via a box swap. An outlet
can have both S11R and BI2A counters and continue to function normally. Outlets will not
lbe notified of this upgrade.
At June 18 (1600), 8 counters were outstanding. Currently (July 3) 1 counter remains to be

2002
BI2B delivers changes to the application and includes some bug fixes: S11 Print Preview (4
jobservations found in testing), S11 Training Default Stock Units and to eliminate a black
Imessage box. This is a much smaller drop, so will be a single distribution package.
However, this change has to be applied to all counters within an outlet at the same time, so
\Counter News and screen messages are being developed.
The pilot for this counter drop was successfully committed on June 17.
Network changes for Network Banking
Network I Infrastructure: One of the key changes in this release is the introduction of FRIACO (Fixed Rate Internet
April - July 2002 (Access Call Origination), which changes the way the data centre 'talks' to an outlet.
