Exec Summary

* We continue to make strong progress against planned improvements. The vast majority are being completed as
planned, and for those that are experiencing problems, the IDG is actively engaged to resolve. In addition, Internal
Audit are assuring each delivery and this too is progressing well, with only a few minor areas requiring additional
work,

The main primary issue currently blocking the progress relates to the scope of the HSS, and whether it should be
expanded to include additional items. This is preventing the finalisation of a number of treatment strategies. A

8 separate paper is being prepared to provide the details and seek a Board level decision on the way forward. The delay
a to the treatment strategy is not expected to delay the resolution of the detriment.

Since the last Board update, the status of the Inquiry has changed to Statutory. We await guidance from the Inquiry

team on the next steps (both until the interim report, and then beyond) and hope to receive this within the next two
weeks. Using this guidance we will then update our preparation plans, including the associated timelines. The change
to the Inquiry does not change our improvement plans, nor our close focus on maintaining progress.

* The GLO conformance review, being led by Norton Rose Fullbright (NRF), is nearing completion on the CIJ. Draft
findings are in alignment with expectations, showing that some items have been completed and others are inflight to
delivering conformance. There is one area of concern that has been identified where additional actions are required
(relationship with the NFSP and the Grant Agreement), and this is being actioned as a priority.

The corresponding HIJ conformance review has taken a little longer due to NRF not being as familiar with the Horizon
improvement work. We expect this to complete in June 2021.

71% of our identified improvements have been completed, and of those 67% have been tested
as effective by Internal Audit

Good progress continues to be made on getting improvements delivered. We're also maintaining pace on completing the audits to demonstrate
successful delivery.

From the audits, we have identified five improvements where further work is required, and these are (or have been) resolved.

Where we identify additional improvements, they have been added to our tracker and hence the totals below reflect these additions.

Improvements in phase I are being delivered, with 92% on track to meet end of May target
date

+ As the end of May approaches, the vast majority of the planned improvements have been delivered as intended. A short summary of those
outstanding is contained on the next slide

« Of note, a number of the red RAG items relate to resolving historic detriment and share the same root cause for delay — a decision needs to
be made on the scope of the Historical Shortfalls Scheme. Once this decision is made, the red items will rapidly clear and return back to
making good progress. Despite the delay, the team are still forecasting that the next phase (repayment of detriment) will not be delayed.

Progress on May deliverables is being maintained, with the three red status item being closely

managed by IDG

Postmaster balance uncertainty is linked to the HSS scope decision mentioned on previous slide {note, this slide only focusses on deliveries to end

May}

Appeals and Disputes is flagged red below due to Post Office taking additional time to create and agreed the right format and style for the appeals
panel. This is an important improvement and hence the additional time is felt appropriate. This action is expected to complete within the first 2

weeks of June.

Memoview has been largely completed but is currently being held at red due to an ongoing piece of work looking at a resolution for those
postmasters where we do not have an email address or other contact details. There are a range of reasons why POL does not have this information.

To include the “top of the
pyramid” headline issues
where we needed to
explain how the most
egregious failings of the
historical prosecutions had
been rectified.

To arrange for the Board to

actually running, for
example, what happened
at a month end now
compared with what used
to happen.

To commission external
assurance on the key
systems and processes in
addition to the assurance
we had already sought on
conformance with the
Judgments.

Progress has been made against both of these actions (draft pyramid created

and options identified for Board to see systems), but the recent announcement

around the Inquiry means we may need to reassess timings.

We want to ensure the Board has the most up-to-date and appropriate
preparation for the Inquiry. Given our sustained progress with improvements,
our story will change (and improve) over time, so timeliness of activity will
ensure we can support the Inquiry in the best way.

The Inquiry team will provide some additional guidance within the next two
weeks and have indicated that they hope to set out if/how evidence provision
and oral sessions may change. This may therefore change our current
preparations.

The timing and nature of the additional assurance activity is closely aligned
with the Inquiry timescales. We already use our own Internal Audit team
(supported by Deloitte) to review all completed improvements and will set out
a plan for any required additional assurance to meet the new Inquiry
timescales in the coming month,

Of note, the GLO conformance work is also underpinning the overall assurance
of completed actions and is due to complete in June 21.

Reminder of Intent for GLO Conformance work

yodey dnosp Auenijaq juawienosduy Z°L1 GEL

* Post Office has started a process to formally review the actions and improvements delivered, comparing them to the
requirements of the judgements and hence determining whether POL is now, or will be at a defined future point, fully
GLO conformant.

* Board will be aware that over the course of the last few years there have been many reviews conducted, each rightly
building on the last and drawing on improved Post Office understanding in the intervening time. Whilst each of these has
delivered recommendations and reassurance on progress, none have formally compared changes with the original
judgement to formally assess conformance.

* Following this short package of work, Post Office will :
* Be able to make a determination on its current conformance position
* Understand any remaining legal conformance gaps
+ Have the reassurance that plans are in place to close those gaps.

/90/E0-1Z0Z EuNr EF

ir

For those at the Inquiry, this work will enable confidence in articulating our current position and clarity on the specific
areas which are still in-flight to finalise conformance.

* The work focussed on the two judgements (CIJ and HIJ) and there are two parallel but closely couple workstreams
delivering an overall view on GLO conformance

* The determination of GLO conformance will be made by POL staff. Whilst three external companies have been asked to
support this work, they will not make the decision. They will only collate the required evidence and analysis upon which
a decision can be taken.

Cl] Conformance Progress update

* The draft CIJ report, which provides a view on legal conformance, is on track to be circulated to SteerCo for review by w/c

* The report will provide an assessment of legal conformance against each of the CIJ themes and an overall view of
conformance. The following ratings have been agreed by Steerco:

Q

&

(a) Full conformance: It appears that POL has fully remediated the underlying reasons for an adverse CIJ finding
such that the criticism no longer applies;

(b) Substantive conformance: It appears that POL has remediated the underlying reasons for the adverse finding
subject to relatively minor deficiencies (i.e. which do not go to the root of the relevant criticism) which may be
addressed to ensure ‘full’ conformance;

(c) On the path to substantive conformance: It appears POL is in the process of altering its practices to remediate
the underlying reasons for an adverse CIJ finding, where: 1)the pending changes will, once implemented,
achieve substantive conformance; and 2)substantive conformance will be achieved in a well-defined period of
time;

(4) Need to develop a path to substantive conformance: It appears that POL has not remediated the reasons for the
relevant criticism in the CIJ, and there is no evidence which suggests substantive conformance is likely to be
achieved in a well-defined period of time, based on the information provided.

S recommended change. An example of this is the branch trading statement where Post Office is providing all of the

required information to postmasters, but have not yet been able to make the IT changes such that it appears on the
statement itself. For this and similar examples, Post Office will be substantively conformant

« With regards to what Post Office has done to change the culture, it is anticipated that this will be classed as “on a path to
substantive conformance”. This recognises the fact that considerable work has and is being done to address the issues of
the past, but this is on-going and it will take more for Post Office to say it has fully changed the culture within the
organisation.

« There will be one area that is expected where it will be identified as needing to develop a path to conformance, which
relates to the relationship with the NFSP and the Grant Agreement. It has been identified that whilst initial proposals
were made to reflect the requirements of the CIJ, this was never completed and remains a gap. Given the changes to the
Horizon Inquiry timeline, this will be a priority for Post Office to remediate.

HIj Conformance Progress update

yodey dnosp Auenijaq juawienosduy Z°L1 GEL

« There have been a series of workshops with NRF, KPMG and Post Office to discuss how the HIJ team and KPMG have
interpreted the HIJ, and the subsequent actions that have been taken and are planned to address the findings.

« NRF are in the process of using the output of the workshops and supporting collateral to determine whether the findings
have been interpreted correctly and that the actions taken and those planned are appropriate to achieve conformance.

The report will also acknowledge that due to the technical changes that are required and the scope of the plan, this will
take time to deliver and that Post Office is on more of a journey in comparison with the CIJ which is almost complete.

« NRF are in the process of drafting the findings and making their conclusions. It is anticipated that the draft report will be
ready by w/c 7* June, subject to the initial outline meeting the business requirements. This is currently being circulated
to the Steerco for review.
