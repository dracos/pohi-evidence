Hi Alwen

I've had a look, see attached. I am confused as to whether we are agreeing to the second sight view that they need until end of
October for the full review where they can, or whether we are being firmer and saying they finish afier the three cases. Can you
clarify?

Suggest you send to Martin Edwarda as well before Paula. I have added various bits here and sorry they are not in tracking - on the
iPad.

I hope your day hasn't been too grim.

Best wishes
Mark
