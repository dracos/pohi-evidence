Laura,

Thank you for our submission — apparently BNR has been chatting to Lord Arbuthnot in the Lords and promised him
an update in May to prevent him raising it with the Secretary of State when he meets with Conservative Peers in May.

We will see if we can bring the update meeting forward from June to late April.

Kind regards

Hi Laura,
I put a hard copy of the letter in BNR’s weekend box and she had the following comments:

“I would like officials to advise on a reply / the need for a meeting. I would also like advice on when I should brief the
Secretary of State. It’s not definitive as I see it.

Kind regards

I believe this was sent to your office directly on Friday, but forwarding in case it went in hard copy only. Would you
like a short covering submission from officials to go with the letter?

Thanks
