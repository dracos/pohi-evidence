11___Introduction

The TPS sepext-Report set-Set has been designed to enable the_transactions
carried _out in outlets using —Electronicthe Electronic Point of Sale Service
(EPOSS)-system-on the Outlet Processing System+{OPS), to be reconciled with
the transaction data which is veturned-transmitted to POCLPON Transaction
Information Processing (TIP), and also to reconcile the daily transaction data
with the Cash Account (CA) data at the end of the Cash Account Period (CAP).
The TPS Report Sets also_identify identifies any “exeeptionserrors”, which
occur within Counter counter transactions, or during the Harvesting harvesting
process, In addition to exceptionserrors highlighted by ICL Pathway within the
EPOSS-TPS repoxt-Report setSet, exeeptionserrors may also be discovered by

POCLPON fo: pated stad swhen reconciling data within
its central systems or which relate to client-enquiries from POCLPON clients,
To initiate the BIMS procedure, ICL Pathway and ROCLPON isegenerate
aBusiness Business Incident—forlncidents for one or more ti TTOrs
discovered.

NB: Acceptance of this document showld-will not indicate acceptance of a specific
Horizon / TIP Interface solution. Those solutions should be identified within the
relevant AIS or contractual document.

2 Scope

This document sets out the reconciliation and incident management
procedures to be adopted by the Management Support Unit (CS / MSU), for
dealing with the Bu jusiness Incidents relating to the Transaction Processing
‘System-(TPS) reconciliation Rreport Set exceptionserrors and POCLPON raised
generated Business lincidents. - This includes reconciling the data contained in
the TPS Rreport Sets and raising Horizon System Help Desk (HSH}-) Business

3B TPS Reconciliation Reporty

ICL Pathway will generatecurrently generate six daily TPS exeeptienexception
reports_(from the host and counter reconciliation software), and_one Non
Polled Outlet report from the host, which are described briefly below for
information purposes:

1. Host Detected Transaction Control Errors:

Shows detail for any outlet where the control totals for the transactions output
by the Host-host to POCLPON TIP do not match the Daily-daily Transaction
transaction Totals-totals calculated by the counters.
2. TPS Harvester ExceptionsErrors:

Lists exeeptienerror conditions detected by the Harvester when failing to
process one of the messages in the message store
3. Host Detected Cash Account Control Errors;

Shows detail for any outlet where the Control-control totals for the number of
entries on the Cash Account output by the Host-host to ROCLPON TIP do not
match the Control-control Totals-totals calculated by the Counterscounters
4. Counter Detected Reconciliation Errors:

Shows details for any outlets where the accumulated Daily-daily Transaction
transaction control totals for the Cash Account peried-Period do not match the
totals on the Cash Account produced by the Counterscount

5. Counter Transaction ExceptionsErrors:

Lists exceptionerror conditions detected by the counter when failing to process
one of the messages in the message store.
6, Receipts not Equal to Payments:

Identifies where the Cash Account ‘Payment’ table total does not equal the
Cash Account ‘Receipts’ table total.
7. Non Polled Outlets: [Formatted }
Identifies all_outlets, which have not been polled and have therefore not (Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )

transmitted any transactions to POCLPON TIP.

CS / MSU, on a daily basis by o9.oohrs, where
they will be checked for completeness and accuracy of content. In the event.
that the reports do not arrive, or after checking appear to be incorrect, in the

It is not intended that CS / MSU will deliver any of the TPS Reeport Sets to
POCLPON as a matter of course, other than the Non Polled Outlet report, An
extract from a-the TPS reconciliation Reeport Set may however be delivered as
‘evidence’ as an attachment to the BIMS seport-Report / MER if it is considered
by ICL Pathway that this would aid tothe reconciliation or settlement process
within ROCLPON.

Errors, ONE Business Incident will be raised _to cover_each i

related to each other or if they relate to one Cash Account). A BIMS report
ontaining appropriate information (in accordance with section 4.5.1.1) will b

issued relating to that exeeptionerror or group of exeeptienserrors,

Where there is a need to correct Data Errors, ICL Pathway may make corrective
assumptions, based upon the format and content of previous valid records of
the same type, if no other detail is available. For example, where a transaction
ode is unknown, the mode used may be obtained a previous transactio:

asics ger Transaction Processing’ of the assumption, and anticipates
has esis made, POCLPON may wish to review and validate these assumptions
on_a case by case basis and it should be noted that any assumptions made
would not necessarily set a precedent.

Where PON agrees that_a Cash Account transmitted to PON TIP shall be
repaired rather than require a MER, then ICL Pathway’s obligation to transmit a
repaired Cash Account may be satisfied by transmitting such part of the
repaired Cash Account as its necessary to correct the Data Error concerned,
provided that such transmission complies with the requirements of the CCD

474.7_Linksy to Problem Management «—[Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )

The processes highlighted within this document are not intended to replace the
current agreed Problem Management procedures, which will run side by side
with the incident management process, as has always been the case.

By way of example, “pProblems” wilLmay be raised by ICL Pathway or
POCLPON according te the following criteriain the following scenarios:

¢ Where there is a trend of similar “Business”incidentsBusiness Incidents
where there is no identifiable cause, This willmay include the scenario where
the number of Data Errors discovered after transmission to POCLPON TIP
exceeds 20 within the relevant Data Error Counting Period, (CA Sch, Go1
para 3.6.6.2)

¢ Where a ‘System’ incidentSystem Incident has been raised and the cause is
unknown. (A problem may not necessarily be raised for every ‘System’

incidentSystem Incident).

Problem management expands the scope of the “System—incidentincident
management process described in this document to include any wider issues;
which, which are—necessarymust_be dealt with in order —to rectify the
issueproblems and to ensure that the associated Business and / or System
Incidents are not repeated.

Whilst the-A ‘System incidentSystem Incident is generated by is-used-within
ICL Pathway to ensure the relevant code,-fix or fix etc, is developed, tested and
delivered to the live estate.; However, resolution of the-Problem—problems
which arise as a result of that System Incident will cover the—specificany
additional requirements of POCL-both parties see.g, Counter News updates,
briefings etc. and in many cases the authority from POCLPON to proceed with
a relevant fix.
