Subject: Meeting arrangements

Hello, Mr Arbuthnot suggested we discuss a possible meeting time and date. The only times
we would be able to attend his office in the very near future would be from 5pm on 12" July
or the morning of 17", although I do appreciate that is his last day before recess. The name
of our expert forensic accountant who will be accompanying me is Miss Kay Linnell and I
would be obliged if you would inform Mr Arbuthnot of her.
