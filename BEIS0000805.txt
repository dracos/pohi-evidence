[4] Further scope for self-help is possible but this either involves trade-offs
in the near term or it delivers benefits outside of the 3YP

We have cost saving targets for FY23/24 and we will have further targets for FY24/25. However cash constraints limit
what we can deliver in the near term

Yand noting subsidy has been flat for five years), we

If DBT _ was tl
:  Woiildalso have more funds to support cost saving activity

would;

We know our costs can and should be reduced and we have a track record of taking costs out across our business
over the last ten years. But to have any material lasting impact we need access to funding

With limited capacity, tight cash and uncertain future funding, working up detailed cost saving plans is speculative
and high risk. Plans developed today can only be implemented today
