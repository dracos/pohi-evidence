Dear Theresa,

I can now confirm that James will call Paula as arranged, on 11 June at 4pm. If this suddenly
proves to be inconvenient, please do get in touch.

With thanks for your patience,
Janet

Hi Theresa

Thanks for your patience with this.

Just to confirm that we will try for the phone call between Paula and James, on 11 June at 4pm, to discuss
the meeting to be held on 18 June, and agree an agenda.

I will not see James before that morning, and so will not be able to confirm this absolutely until then. I do
hope this is OK — not ideal, I know!

Have a lovely weekend, and I will talk to you in due course.
Kind regards

Janet
