1. This benefit is generated as a result of if being a minimum requirement to take Benefits
Agency encashment (BES) data only from the Pathway system and process if to enable the
reconciliation of automated transactions for settlement to the client until Full TIP is
implemented. i.e. at least either Option A or Option B have to be adopted.

Because of this minimum requirement each option avoids the cost of doing one or other of
these two options as an alternative solution.

2. These benefits arise from there being a decreasing need to key Cash Accounts in the Data
Processing Unit (DPU) as the Pathway system rolls out,

They have been calculated based on the total DPU staff cost adjusted for the proportion of
key depressions devoted to Cash Accounts.

3. If there are less Cash Accounts then these will neither need to prepared for the DPU
tinised, ‘phone copies taken and batched) nor amalgamated and filed afterwards.

4, The client benefit arises from the Department of National Savings (DNS) requirement to
receive transaction level data from September 1997. Without a TIP solution the files would
have to transferred to the DNS direct from Pathway. The estimated cost of doing this has
been included as avoided Pathway development cost based on 22m DNS transaction per year.

2. POCL staff are required to manage the project, manage the interfaces, develop the system
and test the development.

3. External Staff are being used from both iT and Sema to ensure the partnership

Costs

A system is currently being developed within CTP to process automated transaction data for
the Pathway Initial Go-Live (IGL) . These costs represent those to extend and operate the
system to support the Pathway roll out beyond IGL. The costs of the CTP development
assume that negligible capital cost will be incurred for the IGL release. Thereafter a server
would be required and the datahase would have to converted from an Access to a SQL
version to expand the capacity of the system beyond IGL,

They are based on the Project Initiation Document (PID) for the CTP BES project.
Additional c have been included by the TIP Project Team as soft estimates for data

collection (e.g. comms, routing), operational testing and software maintenance which were
not costed in the PID.

Cash Account Keying.

The cost per Cash Account of keying is based on the fact that 73% of key depressions in the
Data Processing Unit are Cash Account related. The total staffing cost of the DPU including
the relatively high proportion of agency labour was £332,231 in the quarter April - June 1996
when 205939 Cash Accounts were keyed. This equates to a cost of £1.18 per Cash Account.

Example

In week ending 09/11/97 a total of 6111 office cash accounts are planned to be automated
which will result in a processing saving cost of £7197 (at £1.18 per Cash Account.)

There are costs associated with paper Cash Accounts, i.e. resource required to prepare
manual Cash Accounts for the Data Processing Unit (DPU), namely scrutiny, batching and
the obtaining of telephone copies if Cash Accounts are missing, Following the keying there is
a further process to amalgamate Cash Accounts to produce period data and the filing. These
processes occupy an element of Postal Assistant resource within Client Transaction
Processing.

Three CTP Regional Cash Account teams deemed to give a fair representation .NT and East
AngliaSSWW and NE were used to obtain the processing costs utilised in the table. The
costings were derived by taking staff costs applicable to the above work during the period
April to June 1996 inc. and dividing it by the volume of work carried out to arrive at a cost
per account of 0.29p.

Example

In week ending 09/11/97 a total of 6111 office cash accounts are planned to be automated
which will result in a processing saving cost of £1753 (at £0.29 per Cash Account.)

Cash Ac Kevi

The cost per Cash Account of keying is based on the fact that 73% of key depressions in the
Data Processing Unit are Cash Account related. The total staffing cost of the DPU including
the relatively high proportion of agency labour was £332,231 in the quarter April ~ June 1996
when 205939 Cash Accounts were keyed. This equates to a cost of £1.18 per Cash Account,

Example

In week ending 09/11/97 a total of 6111 office cash accounts are planned to be automated
which will result in a processing saving cost of £7197 (at £1.18 per Cash Account.)

‘Transaction Information Processing (TIP) Project Inwrim TIP Working Papers

There are costs associated with paper Cash Accounts, i.e. resource required to prepare
manual Cash Accounts for the Data Processing Unit (DPU), namely scrutiny, batching and
the obtaining of telephone copies if Cash Accounts are missing. Following the keying there is
a further process to amalgamate Cash Accounts to produce period data and the filing. These
processes occupy an element of Postal Assistant resource within Client Transaction
Processing.

Three CTP Regional Cash Account teams deemed to give a fair representation NT and East
Anglia,SWW and NE were used to obtain the processing costs utilised in the Table. The
costings were derived by taking staff costs applicable to the above work during the period
April to June 1996 ine. and dividing it by the volume of work carried out to arrive at a cost
per account of 0.29p.

Example

In week ending 09/11/97 a total of 6111 office cash accounts are planned to be automated
which will result in a processing saving cost of £1753 {at £0.29 per Cash Account.)

Client Benefit

‘The client benefit arises from the Department of National Savings (DNS) requirement to
receive transaction level data fram September 1997. Without a TIP solution the files would
have to transferred to the DNS direct from Pathway. The estimated cost of doing this has
been included as avoided Pathway development cost.

‘The formula provided by the Automation Development Team (ADT) is:

No. of transactions * Scorecard weighting for link to clients * Price per service point

22m * 1 * 0.265 = £58300 per year

or £20000 (September to December 1997) ie £58300 * 4/12.

Pathway would not wish to establish links to a client for such a short time and may therefore

seek an additional one-off charge to cover set up costs if they did not see the transaction
related charge covering their investment.

Costs

ROCL Staff

The POCL staff costs are based on the formation of a discrete POCL team devoted to Interim
TIP although it will not occupy 100% of all their time as shown in Table 2. The period of
work will run from mid-November to the end of April 1997. The staff numbers include four
temporary CM2 recruits te the project in addition to current template. The staff rates have
from been derived from information obtained from the POCL Finance Executive
Management Accounts.

Transaction Information Processing (TIP) Prnject, watiigrin TIP Working Papers

Consideration was given to the implementation of the TIP solutions on an alternative Hewlett
Packard (HP) hardware platform. This is initially attractive as there would be less conversion
work to achieve a production system from the prototype constructed on the same platform.
The development would therefore be lower risk. However there are a number of
disadvantages in a mid range solution:

© the acquisition of an HP platform is likely to involve capital expenditure which may be
non-recoverable in Pull TIP implementation;

* hardware leasing over a 9-12 month period equates to purchase price although it may be
possible to negotiate purchase against a guaranteed trade-in for future HP purchase within
POCL. This is a high probability, but the expenditure remains at risk and the process
would be difficult to control between individual projects;

« the total HP capital expenditure and the associated support costs would be required
regardless of the timing, duration or volume throughput of the Interim System. This is not
the case with the mainframe which is pro rata to the data volume;

* the overall cast of the midrange solution for the preferred option is £155.6k allowing for a
40% recovery on a trade-in value compared with the cost of the mainframe solution
which is £42.3k (see working paper ).
