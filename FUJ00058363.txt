e Areconciliation incident arising as a result of agreed ‘Fallback’ procedures being invoked by the Postmaster in order to
facilitate the collection of benefit during times of ICL Pathway system failure.

FRAUD INCIDENT
e Areconciliation incident arising following fraudulent activity within the DSS, POCL or ICL Pathway system / service.

INCOMPLETE TRANSACTION
e Transactions resulting in the payment of benefit to a customer without the associated authorised payment being
processed and marked as ‘Encashed’, due to ICL Pathway system failure or clerical error within the post office, resulting
in a possible duplicate encashment when collecting subsequent benefit payments. (NB. Incomplete Transactions,
although technically falling into either the PO Incident or POCL Incident categories, have been classified separately due
to their high profile).

NON-COMMITTED TRANSACTION
e Transactions resulting in the payment of benefit to a customer without the associated authorised payment being
processed and marked as ‘Encashed’. This can be due to the transaction being wilfully voided or any other clerk action
which prevents transaction committal when the system is working correctly.

PAS INCIDENT
¢ Areconciliation incident occurring within the ICL Pathway PAS with possible DSS, POCL or ICL Pathway system /
service implications.

PO INCIDENT
e Areconciliation incident identified (usually at the time) by the Postmaster.

2. MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

2.1 KEY POINTS - DECEMBER 1998

e The overall incident rate has increased slightly to 0.04% in December, with 40 incidents being received against 89k encashed
payments. ‘Incomplete transactions’ account for 32.5% of exceptions received by BSU in December.

e There were 21 ‘Non committed’ transactions this month, all being due to the clerk voiding the transaction after paying the
customer, equating to 0.023% of the total encashment stream.

e The number of ‘Incomplete Transactions’ received in December increased to 13, which is 0.015% of the total encashment

stream. Four Incomplete Transactions incidents, which were all related, were due to power failure. These are discussed in
Section 5 of this document. The remaining incidents were due to a combination of HSH instructions, system freeze, system
message re-boot and software error.

e The number of transactions which have been forcibly committed are slightly lower this month with there being 34 occurrences,

therefore still indicating a trend, where clerks are still leaving the system without finishing the transaction. The total value of
transactions saved over the December period is £1536.50.
