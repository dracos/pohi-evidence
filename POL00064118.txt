lam the person named above and I am employed by Post Office Ltd, part of the
Royal Mail Group, as a Field Support Team Leader based in Birmingham. I have
been employed by the Post Office for the last 29 years or so and part of my
duties is to undertake audits of accounts at Post Office® counter outlets. This
means that I would attend an office when instructed and undertake a full check
of the cash, stock and vouchers on hand at that Post Office®. All Post Office®
outlets use a computerised accounting system known as HORIZON and are
required to complete accurate cash declarations every working day. Full stock,
cash and voucher declarations are prepared at laid down times (every 4 or 5
weeks), which is called a Trading Period. The documentation or “balance”
completed is known as the Trading Statement. This Trading Statement when
finalised should be signed by the Postmaster as an accurate reflection of stock
and cash held at the office. There is no requirement for offices to balance their
tills on any other day apart from the previously mentioned, end of trading period.
The option does exist however for the till to be balanced on a weekly basis,
which was the old previous weekly Cash Account process before the trading

statements were introduced late in 2005. A Post Office Cash Account week ran
from start of business on a Thursday right through to close of business on the
following Wednesday. All Post Offices were duty bound at that time to balance
their accounts at the end of an accounting week, whereby a Cash Account
(Final) printout was obtained from the HORIZON system and signed by the
Postmaster. On Thursday 11" September 2008 I attended Astwood Bank Post
Office along with my colleagues Kevin Watkins and Faith Lavender and on
arrival at the office at around 08.15hrs we introduced ourselves to the
Postmaster Mr Julian Wilson. Mr Wilson allowed us access to the secure area
and at the commencement of the audit he advised me that there would be a
shortfall of about £27,000. He explained that this was due to shortages
accumulated at the branch over the last 5 years or so and that he had been
inflating the cash figures in order that the office show a balance each month. I
accessed the safe and produce all cash and stock proper to the branch in order
that I could carry out the financial audit. I then obtained the, ‘office snapshot’.
The ‘office snapshot’ is a Horizon generated report that details the cash and
stock on hand that should be present at the time it is printed, in addition to the
business transacted through the branch during a ‘said period’. Having completed
this process I continued with the audit and the result was a final deficiency of
£27,811.98 that I posted to the Post Office Late Account Duty. I informed Mr
Glen Chester Post Office Contract Manager and Mr Graham Brander Post Office
Fraud Team Leader. Mr Wilson was precautionary suspended by Mr Chester
and following the audit the branch was transferred to an interim Postmaster. I
now produce my audit report showing the deficiency and explaining my findings
