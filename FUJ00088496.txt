RMGA Information Security Policy

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

1. Introduction

1.1 Context

This policy is applicable to the Fujitsu Services Royal Mail Group Account (RMGA). For the
purpose of this document, the terms Fujitsu Services Royal Mail Group Account or Fujitsu
Services Royal Mail Group Account Staff shall (unless indicated otherwise) include all
employees and contractors engaged by Fujitsu Services and its subcontractors to the extent to
which their activities are relevant to the delivery of Services.

Section 5 of this document sets out the Executive Information Security Policy Statement for the
RMGA which, together with the Framework of Controls in sections 6 to 15 (collectively the
Information Security Policy) satisfy the contractual requirement for an ISO/IEC27001:2005
based Information Security Policy.

This policy complies with Post Office Limited's (POL) Community Information Security Policy for
Horizon (CISP) (Ref: RMPOLOO2CISP); Fujitsu Services Manage Information Security Policy
(Ref: CPM34); and Fujitsu Services Security Master Policy (Ref: CPM20).

2 Information Security Policy Development

This information security policy has been developed and works in parallel with the Fujitsu
Services Horizon Security Policy version 12 (ref: RSPOLOO2) and it has been updated to reflect
the provision of the HNG-x Service as well as being structured in accordance with
ISO/IEC27001:2005.

Although the organisational and management policy statements contained within this policy will
apply to the whole of RMGA, the technology and operational control statements are based upon
requirements for Services provided to POL. It is likely that this policy will be updated at its next
review to include relevant statements for Services provided to Royal Mail Group (RMG).

2.1 Purpose

The policy applies to all RMGA Staff and is mandatory. Failure to comply with the policy will be
regarded as a disciplinary issue and may result in disciplinary action.

This Information Security Policy sets out management direction and support for information
security, along with minimum standards to be met by RMGA, consistent with
ISO/IEC27001:2005, contractual commitments and relevant POL requirements as expressed in
CISP (Ref No 16).

This Information Security Policy:
e Provides a statement of executive commitment and support for information security;

e Provides a framework of controls within which the Services will be developed,
implemented and delivered by RMGA in all areas of its business;

e Identifies the information security awareness and education requirements for all RMGA

Staff;

RMGA Information Security Policy

Fe)
FUJITSU

Commercial in Confidence

e Describes the compliance, audit and management arrangements over information
security and the action that may be taken should this policy not be followed; and

e Allocates information security responsibilities.

2.2 Information Security

Information is an asset, which, like other important business assets, has value to an organisation
and consequently needs to be suitably protected. Information security protects information from
a wide range of threats in order to safeguard customers and staff, ensure business continuity,
minimise business damage and maximise operational efficiency.

Information can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically,
transmitted by post or using electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation.
Whatever forms the information takes, or means by which it is shared or stored, it should always
be appropriately protected and is subject to the provisions of this policy document.

Information security is characterised here as the preservation of:

* Confidentiality: ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorised to have
access;

e Integrity: safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing
methods;

e Availability. ensuring that authorised users have access to information and associated
assets when required.

Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of countermeasures, including
policies, practices, procedures, organisational structures and technical measures. Therefore by
using an Information Security Management System (ISMS), this provides a systematic approach
to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. It also encompasses
people, processes and IT systems

3 Scope

3.1 Statement of Scope

This Information Security Policy specifies mandatory information security requirements to be
applied throughout RMGA in the provision of its Services to Post Office Limited. The scope of
this policy includes Horizon and HNG-x. Internal Management Systems and Internal Support
Systems are also covered by this policy.

This Information Security Policy covers all activities undertaken by RMGA in the provision of
these Services including design, development, deployment, operation and support of Services,
as well as the programme management, stakeholder management, governance and
administrative procedures applied by executive management to oversee those Services.

This Information Security Policy document describes the overall strategy for providing
information security and is based best practice as defined by ISO/IEC27001:2005.

Information security risks within Post Office sites that are outside of the scope of the Services
provided by RMGA are excluded from the scope of this Information Security Policy.

RMGA Information Security Policy

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

The objectives of effective information security risk management are:

¢ To facilitate the overall management of security risk for Information Systems and IT
related equipment, networks and applications for RMGA;

e To generate and maintain an accurate and current Information Security Risk Register for
information assets which support The Service;

e Tocreate and maintain a Statement of Applicability; and

e To provide appropriate management information in relation to Information Security risk
and ensure that this is co-ordinated with the RMGA Business Risk management process.

4.1 Information Security Risk Assessment Approach

Risk Assessment will form a key component of the RMGA Information Security Management
System (ISMS).

A formal information security risk assessment methodology will be adopted that is suited to the
RMGA ISMS, and the identified business information security, legal and regulatory
requirements. The risk assessment methodology will be selected by the Fujitsu Services RMGA
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and shall ensure that risk assessments produce
comparable and reproducible results. Full details of the risk assessment methodology can be
found in RMGA Information Security Risk Management Approach (Ref: SVM/SEC/STD/0006)

The RMGA CISO will establish criteria for the management of information security risk. In
addition to security risk management and containment, there will be criteria for accepting risks
and identifying the acceptable levels of risk and these will be maintained and reviewed at regular
intervals. Security risk acceptance criteria will be developed in accordance with the RMGA
Business Risk management process.

Risk Assessments will be conducted on a regular, at least annual, basis and additional risk
assessments may, where necessary, be carried out to determine appropriate controls for specific
risks.

Information assets, within the scope of the ISMS, will be identified and recorded along with the
owners of these assets. The asset ‘owners’ will participate in information security risk
assessments conducted by, or on behalf of, the Chief Information Security Officer.

The RMGA CISO will establish and maintain an information security risk register and will
produce a Statement of Applicability (Ref: SVM/SEC/MAN/0001) which will define the controls
which must be implemented for all areas of the RMGA lifecycle management, in accordance
with the Information Security Policy, and in compliance with ISO/IEC27001:2005.

Fujitsu Services will work with the customer, to agree appropriate countermeasures
commensurate with the value and nature of the business risk. The risk acceptance criteria need
to be agreed with Post Office Limited.

All identified information security risks will be recorded in the RMGA information security risk
register and those which require further mitigation will be recorded in a Risk Treatment Plan
(RTP) (Ref: SVMSECPLAO001) which will include planned mitigation actions and next review
dates. Risk treatment criteria must be agreed by the RMGA Information Security Review Board,
and documented in the risk treatment plan. It may also be appropriate for recorded information
security risks to be incorporated into corporate, business or project risk registers. The risk
treatment plan may be used by internal auditors or IA inspection and feeds into the Statement of
Applicability (SOA) for ISO/IEC27001:2005 auditors.

Traceability, based on the outputs of the risk management process, is needed to ensure that
RMGA can determine why a given risk management decision was taken, and the RTP should be
able to demonstrate the following:

Data Handling and Classification (Ref: ITS8) contains detailed guidance on labelling and
handling information. For ease of reference a table is supplied at Appendix A. If in any doubt
advice should be sought from the RMGA CISO.

All documentation and displayed output from POL systems containing information classified as
confidential or strictly confidential must carry an appropriate classification label.

Company restricted,documents containing sensitive information shall be stored within the secure
library in Dimensions according to the labelling and handling requirements.

RMGA information, which supports delivery of the Service, that requires protection from
unauthorised access (whilst not exhaustive) includes for example:

e The business data exchanged with Post Office Ltd. and its clients (e.g. reference data to
support EPOSS and transaction data resulting from Post Office counter activities.)
Business data is transferred between Post Office Ltd., Post Office Ltd. Clients and the
RMGA Data Centres and between the Data Centres and the Post Office branches. It is
stored at the main operation systems and also in archives. Some data is also available for
management services via the SMDB. RMGA Classification: Company Restricted. POL
Classification: PO Confidential

e RMGA business management data - financials, service level agreements etc. Confidentiality
and integrity requirements exist for much of this data. The Management Information System
collects this data from the operational systems. This is then forwarded as appropriate to
RMGA sites, Post Office Ltd. and their Clients. RMGA Classification: Commercial in
Confidence. POL Classification: INTERNAL - the inclusion of any personal data(as
defined by the Data Protection Act) in this category, escalates the POL classification
to Confidential

e Information contained in documents exchanged between RMGA and POL in the course of
normal business communications. RMGA Classification: Commercial in Confidence.
POL Classification: INTERNAL - detailing security breaches or potential security breaches,
escalates the POL classification to confidential.

e Other data supporting the business processes such as training data (special, non-sensitive,
business style data used in training sessions) and on-line documentation (e.g. Post Office
procedures.) RMGA Classification: Fujitsu Eyes Only or Commercial in Confidence.

e In addition, POL have specific requirements for the handling of Cardholder Data and
Sensitive Authentication Data (see Glossary for definition):

e Sensitive Authentication Data shall not be stored in any file or database including log,
audit or diagnostic files after a transaction has been authorised even if the data is
encrypted. Such data shall also be deleted after use.

e Cardholder Data shall be rendered unreadable anywhere it is stored (including data on
portable media, backup media, and in logs) by using any of the following approaches:
One-way hashes (hashed indexes) such as SHA-1, Truncation, Index tokens and PADs
with the PADs being securely stored; Strong cryptography such as Triple-DES 128-bit or
AES 256-bit with associated key management processes and procedures.

e All Sensitive Authentication Data and Cardholder Data shall be encrypted using
approved algorithms and encryption protocols whilst in transit over any public network. It
is prohibited to send unencrypted PANs by e-mail. Approved algorithms are 128-bit
3DES (as per ANSI X9.52) and 256-bit AES (FIPS 197). Approved encryption protocols
are SSL v3 / TLS, SSH, IPSec, and PPTP. In all other respects Sentive Authentication
data and cardholder data must be treated as POL Confidential: RMGA Company

classification level (through aggregation) may increase /decrease and this must be reviewed and
assessed.

Users must be aware of this accumulation and aggregate effect and must notify the CISO if they
think this may include them. Users must notify the CISO to ensure that you do not contradict any
contractual, legal or compliance requirements and failure to do so may lead to disciplinary
action"

8.1 Prior to Employment

8.1.1. Roles and Responsibilities

Where RMGA Staff have specific information security responsibilities these will be defined in
documented job descriptions. Generic security responsibilities for all staff will be included in all
role descriptions or objectives for the appropriate professional community.

8.1.2 Screening

All applications for employment shall be screened in order to assess reliability. Applicants’
identities and references are to be checked as stated in the Fujitsu Services Policy Security
Checking in HR Shared Services Processes (Ref: HRS1). Equivalent checks will be applied to
all subcontractor staff, as appropriate.

Requirements for further pre-employment checks for RMGA Staff are outlined below. It is the
responsibility of the hiring manager to ensure that employees have the appropriate level of
security for their role.

e Additional security checks, in accordance with POL vetting procedures, must be
performed for all RMGA engineer staff that requires access to Post Office branches in
order to undertake development, support or maintenance activities. Full details can be
found in RMGA Horizon Security Pass Procedure (Ref: RSPROO13).

* Satisfactory Credit Reference Bureau checks will be required for all RMGA Staff who
have access to financial information contained within Post Office systems.

e Criminal Record Checks will be carried out on RMGA Staff. This will be done as part of
a UK Government specified Baseline Standard check.

e Higher level UK Security Clearance may be required for individuals who have access to
POL information classified as Strictly Confidential. Advice should be sought from the
Chief Information Security Officer who will confirm the requirement with POL on a case
by case basis.

When an existing Fujitsu Services employee transfers to work on the RGMA Account then the
hiring manager must ensure the employee has either satisfied the checks above or that the
checks are performed if the employee has not already been fully checked.

RMGA will establish an SLA with Fujitsu core services that ensures all Fujitsu Services staff with
logical access or unescorted physical access to the data centres or support centres are vetted to
at least the above standard

8.1.3 Terms and Conditions of Employment

Services RMGA induction courses for new

Policy documents must be readily available to all staff; this may be achieved by publishing
through the RMGA community portal.

8.2.3 Intimidation

There is always a risk that employees with access to sensitive material will come under forms of
intimidation, it is essential for the safety of those concerned that a system be set up whereby an
at risk employee be able to privately indicate that they are under duress. This need not be an IT
system but needs to be sensitive enough to identify that there is a problem and inform the
correct authorities.

Employees who have been, or are subject to intimidation should attempt to contact the FS
Director of Customer Service directly or indirectly as soon as it is safe to do so. Employees
should not knowingly endanger themselves or others in order to protect company or client assets
from theft or damage by criminal entities.

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

Datacentres providing processing facilities for Post Office data will have much higher levels of
physical security than general offices. However sensitive information wherever it is stored must
be protected in line with this security policy

CCTV footage must be securely stored on appropriate Digital media for a period of no less than
3 months on a rolling basis. There after stored offline in a secure location.

RMGA CISO is responsible for ensuring that appropriate physical and environmental controls
are in place, based on risk assessment, to protect assets from unauthorised access, damage and
interference.

Consideration must be given also to any security threats presented by neighbouring premises.

Intrusion detection alarm systems must be used for installations which are left unattended.
Intrusion alarms may be connected to a security company or the Police. Alarm systems must be
tested regularly and maintained to manufacturers’ requirements.

9.1.2 Physical Entry Controls

Full details of Fujitsu Corporate Policy can be found in Identification Cards and Physical Access
Control (Ref: CS2).

Site security personnel shall control access to all Fujitsu Services RMGA sites, which includes
datacentres. All RMGA staff, whether permanent or contract, will be required to produce a valid
security pass for that site before being allowed access to the site. Access rights must be
removed immediately when the holder leaves the employ of RMGA, whether through leaving
permanent employment of Fujitsu Services or due to re-assignment to other tasks.

Visitors to RMGA premises must have a RMGA sponsor, who must be responsible for that visitor
whilst they are within a RMGA facility. All visitors to Fujitsu Services RMG Account sites are to
be issued with a “visitor's badge” and a record must be made of the visitors date and time of
arrival and departure to the site and the records held for a minimum of 3 months.

RMGA visitors to Post Office Branches must be subject to RMGA vetting procedures and
approval by Post Office Ltd.

9.1.3. Securing Offices, Rooms and Facilities

RMGA employs a best practice approach to securing offices, rooms and facilities across all sites,
including a clear desk policy. In practice this means:

e Access to all secure areas is strictly controlled by the use of security facilities;

« All papers, discs and portable media that contain RMGA ( POL) Information are to be stored
in an appropriately secured place when not in use

« PCs and workstations are to be protected by passwords and, either locked or a password-
protected screen-saver invoked when not in use. Screens are to be timed-out whenever left
inactive for a specified period based on formal risk assessment as defined in the Operational
Use of IT & Communications Systems (Ref: ITS2)

* Support functions and equipment e.g. photocopiers, fax machines must be sited
appropriately within the secure area to avoid demands for access which could compromise
information;

« Doors and windows must be locked when unattended and external protection must be
considered for windows particularly at ground level; and

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

e Directories and internal telephone books identifying locations of sensitive processing facilities
must not be readily accessible by the public.

e Physical access to network jacks, wireless access points, gateways and handheld devices is
restricted.

e The use of portable wireless devices, including 3G phones, is forbidden in areas where
sensitive data is stored, processed or transmitted.

9.1.4 Protecting Against External and Environmental Threats

Detailed policy for Physical and Environmental security of Data Centre environments
(ISN/001377) is included in Fujitsu Services Data Centre Security Policies.

The selection and design of a secure area must take account of the possibility of damage from
fire, flood, explosion, civil unrest and other forms of natural or man made disasters. Account
should also be taken of relevant health and safety standards. Consideration must be given also
to any security threats presented by neighbouring premises.

Hazardous or combustible materials must be stored securely at a safe distance from a secure
area. Bulk supply such as stationery must not be stored within a secure area until required.
There is a Live and a TEST/DR HNG-X Data-centre. In the event that there is a disaster at the
live site, a decision is required to invoke manual fail-over to the Test/DR Datacentre with RTOs
of 2, 5 and 48 hours depending upon the service. Data is replicated between the Live and
Test/DR data-centre in real time, over the inter-site link in order to avoid the delays, costs and
security risks inherent in moving data physically. There is sufficient resilience built into the Live
Data-centre to minimise the risk of equipment or service failures invoking the HNG-X Data-
centre disaster recovery plan.

9.1.5 Working in Secure Areas

Information processing facilities for Post Office Limited data must be housed in secure areas.
Information processing facilities managed by RMGA must be physically separated from those
managed by third parties. Physical and logical segregation of RMGA Assets from other Fujitsu
contracts must be maintained, however shared use of data centres, server rooms and
environmental facilities is permitted. Security measures associated with installed equipment
must take these factors into consideration to reduce RMGA’s risks to an acceptable level.

Similar considerations apply to RMGA Assets at other non-RMGA sites (e.g. AP Client sites).

Managers responsible for secure areas must ensure that access rights to secure areas are
regularly reviewed and updated at least monthly.

Unoccupied secure areas must be physically locked and subject to at least daily periodic checks,
and there must be physical protection and guidelines for those staff working in secure areas.

Access to sensitive information and information processing facilities must be controlled and
restricted to authorised persons only. Authentication controls (e.g. swipe card plus PIN) must be
used to authorise and validate all access. An audit trail of all access must be maintained
securely.

9.1.6 Public Access, Delivery and Loading Areas
Public access to RMGA sites will be through main entrances.

Equipment shall be protected from power failures and other electrical anomalies as appropriate
according to the potential risks identified by formal risk assessment. Where deemed necessary
alternative power arrangements, e.g. backup generators, UPS, dual supplies etc. will be
deployed.

All supporting utilities such as water, electricity air conditioning must be adequate for the
systems they support and shall be regularly tested and inspected to reduce the risk of
malfunction and ensure their availability and integrity.

9.2.3 Cabling Security

It is the responsibility of the Facilities Manager to ensure that all equipment and cabling is
secured to the relevant ISO 27001 standards against interception, for example encryption and
physical security and well maintained and protected against environmental hazards, including
fire and water damage.

9.2.4 Equipment maintenance

Owners of equipment must ensure that it is correctly maintained to enable its continued
availability and integrity. All equipment shall be maintained in accordance with the
manufacturers’ instructions by qualified and authorised maintenance personnel. A record is to be
kept by owners of all maintenance work carried out.

Secure Disposal or Re-use

If equipment is to be disposed of or re-allocated then any RMGA data, software or information
must be irreversibly removed as described in line with Para 7.2.2 and Appendix A of this
document.

All equipment containing storage media (for removable media see para 10.7.2) which may have
been used to store RMGA sensitive information must be checked to ensure that all sensitive
information and licensable software has been removed or securely overwritten prior to disposal
or re-allocation .

Data and licensed software must be erased from IT equipment prior to its disposal. Care will be
exercised as ‘deleted’ data can in certain instances be retrieved using specialist equipment.

Where data or licensed software cannot be erased for technical reasons, the hard disk, floppy
disks, etc, must be destroyed by appropriate means, e.g. shredding, degaussing or in extreme
cases incineration, to prevent data retrieval.

As a minimum, hard or floppy disks must be reformatted, overwritten with ‘0’ and ‘X’ and then
reformatted again. Where confidential or secret data has been stored on the disk, or where for
technical reasons it cannot be overwritten or reformatted the disk must be destroyed as follows:-

e Floppy Disks - Shredded, Degaussed or Incinerated
e Hard Drives - Degaussed or Incinerated
e Tape Reels - Degaussed or Incinerated
e Cartridges - Degaussed or Incinerated
e CD/DVD - Abrasion, Compacting or Incineration

Portable memory devices such as USB sticks, portable hard-drives, PDAs and all the other
gadgets capable of transporting data must be degaussed, cross-shredded, incinerated or pulped.

All mobiles phones must not be used for the purpose of storing RMGA sensitive/confidential
information.

Removal of Property

The removal from site of any equipment which may have been used for storage of sensitive
RMGA data; RMGA or POL information; or any software must be authorised in advance by the
RMGA CISO.

All decommissioning must take account of the removal of any sensitive or confidential
information stored on any hardware or electronic media including backups and must ensure that
any equipment that is not required is securely stored and documented or disposed of in a secure
manner (including network equipment). This includes all equipment used to provide the RMGA
service. Individual units are expected to produce their own procedures to comply with this

RMGA Information Security Policy

Fe)
FUJITSU

Commercial in Confidence

Access to all information assets must be controlled on the basis of business and security
requirements. The purpose of this section is to define the access control policy for Royal Mail
Group Account.

This access control policy defines how access to information system resources is controlled in
the RMGA and the delivery of The Service. It covers the Services provided by RMGA to POL,
including Data Centre systems; RMGA managed systems such as interface systems at POL
Branches and closely related RMGA systems. Access may be the result of direct user action, or
automatically initiated activities.

Procedures for the implementation of the principles of this access control policy, which include
lower level detailed access rules, can be found in the associated access controls joint working
documents [Ref: SVM/SDM/POL/0027.

The main principles of this access control policy are:

e All Live access requests must be authorised by the applicants Line Manager and shown
on Application Form together with User details .Process is RSPROO40 which also
contains the form.

e Physical and logical access to the IT systems must be controlled, with access granted
selectively, and permitted only where there is a specific need.

e The principle of “least privilege” must apply to restrict the access rights of users whether

human or non-human.

e Information must be appropriately separated in filestore, database tables etc. Each data
set must be accessible only to those with a need for that access.

e All access to RMGA systems will be specified in terms of roles.

e Any exceptions to the policy must be documented and signed off by the CISO.

e Individuals in specified roles will be permitted to carry out defined functions and access
specified data.

« Some users may be permitted to carry out more than one major function, so are
permitted to take more than one “role”. This is not permitted in cases where security
may be undermined.

«Access controls associated with resources must define the “role” of the user, not the
individual user's identity.

e Access controls must take account of legal and contractual obligations regarding access
to data and services (see Section 15).

e Access controls must take account of policies on information classification (see 7.2)
and separation of duties (see 10.1.3)

e Access controls must take account of distributed and networked environments including
all types of connection to each asset.

e Access to RMGA information processing facilities by third parties" must only be for the
time needed

e Accountability of individuals is essential and segregation of duties must be enforced.

e There must be segregation of access control roles, e.g. access request, access
authorization, and access to assets.

e Users are individually identified so that they can be made accountable for their actions.

e Multiple individuals will not share access credentials, or be required to share access
credentials due to deployed technical solutions.

e All users and applications must be authenticated to IT systems. This authentication
must identify them as individuals.

e Help Desks must maintain the information required to authenticate the callers and their
Branches/offices as required for the type of call. If the call needs to be passed onto
another internal RMGA help desk, the call must be forwarded only after the initial
authentication has been carried out.

e Wherever authorisation is given orally, normally over a telephone link, additional
verification methods must be used.

e Where possible RMGA operations will be automated to reduce the need for human
intervention and the potential accidental and malicious security breaches that could
result from human activity.

« System management tasks must be automated where practical. This includes taking
remedial action where the results of monitoring the system show this is needed. Only
where action cannot be taken automatically, or human verification of an action is
needed, must human intervention be required.

e Facilities must be used to restrict access to computer and network resources on a need-

to-know basis.

Initial default accounts must be renamed where possible.

Initial default passwords must always be replaced by secure passwords.

All access to RMGA systems will be monitored.

Access to RMGA information processing facilities by third parties must be controlled.

There must be a demonstrable need for third party access.

A risk assessment must be carried out to determine the security implications and control

requirements for any forms of physical and electronic access by third parties.

e Any third party access to transaction data must be “read-only” and must not breach the
confidentiality requirements of this policy.

e On-site third parties must be identified and documented.

e All security requirements resulting from third party access or internal controls must be
reflected in the third party contract. Where there is a special need for confidentiality of
the information, non-disclosure agreements must be used.

e Access to information and information processing facilities by third parties must not be
provided until the appropriate controls have been implemented and a contract has been
signed defining the terms for the connection or access.

e The safety and security, including confidentiality, of access credentials is the
responsibility of the each individual issued with the credentials and of those issuing the
credentials.

11.2 User Access Management

11.2.1 User Registration

There must be clear user access processes for all Users regardless of their geographic
location, role or function, which must include:

e identity management;

« formal authorisation of access requests;

e periodic review of access;

« timely removal or disablement of access rights

Records of all persons registered to use RMGA systems including support systems must
be kept, though the way this is done may be role or service dependent.

11.2.2 Global Users

Global Users are users that can Log On at any HNG-X Branch. The concept has been
introduced to HNG-X as a replacement for the Horizon concept of a one-shot password, which
allows a User to authenticate themselves via the Help Desk and Log On using a common

Managing Global Users) and (SVMSDMSD0001 Service Description) Refer

11.2.3. Out of Hours System Access

Out of Hours system Users shall only access the RMGA systems through the Fujitsu corporate
network and must be used by authorised persons only. Access is to be provided following the
OO Hours Password Changing Process RSPROO47 with clearly defined roles on approved

equipment. 'SVM/SEC/PRO/0026' defines the requirements to provide satisfactory
assurance/evidence that the distribution of global user account IDs and passwords have been
undertaken.

11.2.4 Privilege Management
The allocation and use of privileges shall be restricted and controlled.

The principle of Least Privilege means that each subject in a system is granted the most
restrictive set of privileges (or lowest clearance) needed for their job.

The system will maintain the clearances and authorisations granted to users, and access to
information will be consistent with users’ clearances and privileges.

Access to System Administration accounts will be strictly controlled. Knowledge of the
passwords and authentication for system administrator accounts will be restricted to the
authorised system administrators.

System administrators will be allocated and use a unique identifier, and the passwords will be
subject to more frequent refresh than normal user account standards.

The use of system administration accounts will be kept to a minimum.

Segregation of responsibilities will ensure that no privileged user can cover up unauthorised
actions, and a continuous record of all system administration commands, and the use of
powerful system utilities, will be maintained securely.

11.2.5 User Password Management

There shall be a documented process for the issue and reset of all user passwords. This process
is to ensure that passwords remain private to the user.

Passwords will be stored in a one-way encrypted form and must be protected against substitution
or dictionary attack.

Passwords shall be chosen to conform to the following criteria:

e« Where passwords are used for authentication, the user must be forced to change the
initial password before any other access to the system is permitted.

e Passwords must expire in 30 days.

e Re-use of the same password must not be permitted for either a specified time or until at
least 4 other passwords have been used.

e Passwords must be a minimum of 7 characters long and must be alphanumeric (i.e. a
mix of letters and numbers). There must not be more than two consecutive identical
characters. The password must not be the same as the username.

e After 3 consecutive unsuccessful attempts to log-on, the user must be locked out for at
least 30 minutes or until reset by an administrator

e In general, system users must be subject to the controls specified above. The following
exceptions are permitted:

« The username and password used to automate application login may be held in ‘clear’
i.e. readable format or unencrypted, if it is only accessible to authorised operational
management staff for that system and the potential damage from misuse of that
username is minimised.

e The password may expire less frequently than the 30 days for human users where
suitably obscure passwords are used, e.g. strong passwords consisting of upper case,
lower case characters, numbers and symbols and the risk of external access to such
accounts is very low however this concession must be documented and approved
by the CISO. (This is also referenced in 11.5.3).

11.2.6 Review of User Access Rights

RMGA will conduct a formal review process at regular intervals to review user access rights.
These reviews shall be carried out at least annually, and include revalidation of user access
rights and privileges granted to users. In environments with sensitive information, a process
must be in place to remove accounts that have been inactive for more than 90 days

11.3 User Responsibilities

11.3.1 Password Use

To compliment corporate policy as referenced at ITS 2.1 and in line with good practise all Users
are;

- To keep passwords confidential to themselves.

- Passwords must not be shared with anyone else or stored in any way (unless Fujitsu approved
processes for securely storing say infrequently used passwords).

- To change passwords if they believe they might have been compromised.

- To select passwords that comply with the policy in 11.2.3 and which are easy for the holder to
remember but difficult for someone else to guess.

- Not to use the same value of password on any other system (unless there is assurance that it
will be adequately protected on that system).

System Administrators, service desk personnel and any other individuals capable of resetting
passwords and shall not reveal passwords unless the information owners or authorised users
have first provided definitive evidence substantiating their identity.

Additionally, resetting procedures shall ensure that users comply with the following:

e Change Passwords that are subject to any possible compromise or suspected security
breach;

e Change Passwords regularly to be within their life span before reaching their expiry; and

« Change Passwords temporarily assigned by the helpdesk immediately on first use.

All Fujitsu PCs, workstations and where possible mobile devices e.g. PDAs, will be configured to
automatically lock after a preconfigured period of time to prevent unauthorised use. The system
shall require that the Identification and Authentication process is repeated to unlock the device
before work can be continued.

RMGA Staff will manually lock their PC, workstation (and where possible mobile device) or log-
off before leaving it unattended for extended periods.

A warning screen, which is displayed prior to log-on at PCs and workstations, will warn the reader
that unauthorised access to systems may result in disciplinary or legal action being taken.

For Services provided to POL after a period of inactivity at a Post Office counter, the session will
time out but can be resumed on entry of the password. After a longer period of inactivity, the
user is forcibly logged out.

11.3.3 Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy

RMGA employs a clear desk and clear screen policy across all sites. Employees are required to
ensure that whenever they leave their desk unattended during normal working hours all sensitive
information is protected from unauthorised access by others.

All PCs and workstations will be configured to lock after a preconfigured period of time and will
require a password to unlock. All employees are required to clear their desk of all materials and
property when leaving the office

11.4 Network Access Control

11.4.1 Policy on Use of Network Services

To protect networked services, access to internal and external networked services shall be
controlled by (please also see section 11.4.6. for further details)

Appropriate inter-network interfaces such as firewalls;
Appropriate authentication mechanisms for users and equipment;
Access control lists on routers;

Controls on use of ports;

Control of user access to network information systems;

e The use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to provide authentication and encryption for
business and system management traffic to/from the Post Office branches

e The use of VPN protection for authentication and encryption for all Fujitsu Services Core
Services links.

e The use of dial-up/dial-in for Out of Hours (OOH) access is limited to authorised and
authenticated users and is described in OOH Password Changing Process-
RSPROO47.

FUJITSU

Commercial in Confidence

Authentication, whereby a user's claimed identity is verified, is essential before any access is
granted to any RMGA system. Authentication mechanisms are required to ensure that trust
relationships can be established between communicating components within, and external to,
RMGA Services.

All HNG-x Service connections with remote computer systems must be authenticated. The User
or application that initiates a transfer will be authenticated by both the destination and the source
node. Authentication must be successful before any transfer is executed.

11.4.3 Equipment Identification in Networks

Automatic equipment identification will be considered as a means to authenticate connections
from all locations and equipment within the RMGA.

11.4.4 Remote Diagnostic and Configuration Port Protection

Access to diagnostic or configuration ports must be securely controlled to ensure they are only
available to approved persons at approved times.

11.4.5 Segregation in Networks
Controls must segregate HNG-X from systems run for other clients by Fujitsu Services.

Controls must also reduce the possibility of interference between HNG-X systems by separating
independent parts of the overall system, particularly those which have different security
requirements. (This may be by a combination of network set-up, router controls, controls at ports
of specific systems and Microsoft domain structure.) For example,

* RMGA management sites must separate their main networks from both the Fujitsu
Corporate network and from those more secure Local Area Networks (LAN) used to
access the Data Centre e.g. viaa DMZ

e Systems concerned with Outlet Business Change must be separate from those used for
operational running.

e Security services, e.g. the Key Management Service (KMS), must be protected from
unauthorised access from other systems.

e Traffic originating within the RMGA Data Centres is generally initiated by controlled
applications. These applications (and the way they are configured in the system) must
restrict traffic between systems to the minimum necessary

11.4.6 Network Connection Control

Local users must only have authorised and authenticated access to specific LANs that provide
access to local services and (via controlled connections) to the Fujitsu Corporate network.

The only permitted connections from the RMGA management site network must be:

e To the Fujitsu Corporate network via a controlled router, suitably firewalled and which
restricts traffic to specifically authorised traffic only;

e To Order Book Contro! (OBC) users at regional offices and OBC suppliers at their sites
via a controlled router and firewalls.

* To the secure LANs via a firewall which restricts data to that permitted (e.g. software
from the Configuration Management system).

The only permitted connections from the secure LANs must be:
e To the Data Centres via encrypted links.

e To other secure LANs via an encrypted link (i.e. between the RMGA management sites).
All users with any interactive access to the Data Centres must do so via secure LANs

e Separate secure LANs must be used for separate user groups/activities where Company
Secret/Strictly Confidential data is being handled at RMGA management sites. For example,
Security Management and Audit users must be on a separate high security LAN from other
users.

e Servers at the RMGA management sites that Company Restricted/Confidential data or are
used to update the Data Centre require stronger security and must therefore be on a secure
LAN.

11.4.7. Network Routing Control

All access in and out of the RMGA Data Centres must be restricted to the required traffic from/to
the authorised sources/destinations for business and system traffic using routers and firewalls.
Such traffic must be routed only to the ports at systems which require that traffic. The following
controls will apply:

e All management and support users will access the Data Centres from controlled
workstation environments.

e All RMGA Corporate management, system management and support sites with access
to the main operational systems must have fixed links to the Data Centres.

e External support users with access to any of the RMGA systems containing sensitive or
protectively marked information must access the systems via controlled workstations
and environments as for RMGA support staff, but subject to extra controls. (Support of
routers is an exception — see below).

e Firewalls and Routers must be configured to deny access to external users, (including
support or maintenance users) until this access has been agreed. When permitted, the
appropriate router must be configured to restrict access to the Data Centre to the
particular system(s) needing support.

11.5 Operating System Access Control

11.5.1 Secure Log-on Procedures

Access to operating systems will be controlled by procedures that request the user to log-on
using approved, valid credentials. Where access is granted to Horizon or HNG-x Service
applications, this will be supported by two-factor authentication. Should authentication fail the
system will not indicate which attribute of the authentication process caused the failure. All
access to operating systems for HNG-x shall be subject to monitoring and audit. Passwords must
not be transmitted in clear text over any network

11.5.2 User Identification and Authentication

All users will be uniquely and securely identified and such identity authenticated, prior to access
being granted.

11.5.4 Use of System Utilities

RMGA will ensure that access to system utility programs will be restricted and any unused
system utilities must be removed. Only members of specific administrator groups will be
permitted access. System logging will be enabled to provide audit of all attempts to gain access
to these utilities,

11.5.5 Session Time-out

All Horizon and HNG-x user terminals will be configured to automatically lock after a
preconfigured period of 15 minutes to prevent unauthorised use. The system shall require that
the Identification and Authentication process is repeated to unlock the device.

11.5.6 Limitation of Connection Time

All Horizon and HNG-x user terminals will be configured to automatically disconnect if there is no
user activity in a preconfigured period of time following session time-out.

11.6 Application and Information Access Control

11.6.1 Information Access Restriction

Access to applications hosted and managed by RMGA will be restricted in accordance with the
access control policies set out in this policy document.

RMGA service support-users will not normally have access to financial information contained in
Horizon or HNG-x Services.

11.6.2 Sensitive System Isolation

Horizon and HNG-X systems hosted by RMGA must operate on logically separated networks
segregated by appropriate boundary devices. Platforms hosting the above systems must be
housed in secure zones within data centre locations.

Support Systems located outside RMGA data centres must incorporate high level controls to
ensure that physical and logical separation from all other systems at their site are in place. In all
cases security controls on staff using these systems must be in place.

All such systems must be regularly monitored and audited.

Where remote access is required to RMGA systems remote users will only connect through an
approved remote access facility. As a minimum, this facility will:

« Provide a secure means of authentication of users in addition to identification and password;
and
« Strongly encrypt any data passing across public networks.

Where access involves connection through a third party network, users must be provided with a
personal firewall. Users must also be provided with a facility to enable them to update anti-virus
software to the latest version before receiving any e-mails.

11.6.4 Tele-working

RMGA Staff will only use tele-working facilities with the prior approval of RMGA management.
The tele-working facilities will be secured to a level no less than other RMGA office
environments as governed by this policy document.

12 Information Systems Acquisition, Development
and Maintenance

The objective of this section is to reduce the risk of accidental changes or unauthorised access to
operational systems or data and to ensure that security requirements are fully implemented within the
acquisitions, development and subsequent maintenance of any RMGA delivered system or service.

12.1 Security Requirements of Information Systems

12.1.1 Security Requirements Analysis and Specification

Assurance during development must be supported by the definition of security requirements,
security architecture, detailed security design, design reviews and security testing.

Statements of business requirements for new information systems, or enhancements to existing
information systems must specify the requirements for security controls and must include the
Fujitsu Services relevant security requirements from the Community Information Security Policy
(RMPOLOO2) and this Security Policy.

Security requirements and controls will reflect the business value of the information assets
involved and the potential business damage, which might result from a failure or absence of
security.

Specifications for the requirements for controls must consider security of the automated controls
to be incorporated in the information system, and the need for supporting manual controls.
Similar considerations shall be applied when evaluating software packages, developed or
purchased, for business applications.

System requirements for information security and processes for implementing security will be
integrated in the early stages of information system projects.

If products are bought in, a formal evaluation and procurement process must be followed.
Contracts with suppliers must address the security requirements.

Capacity requirements must be included in requirements analysis to avoid failures due to
inadequate capacity. Future capacity projections must be made to ensure that processing
power, network capacity and storage remain available, and to identify and avoid potential

bottlenecks.

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

Digital signatures provide a means of protecting the authenticity and integrity of electronic
documents. All keys used for signing data must be afforded levels of protection equal to or
greater than the highest levels of data signed.

Encryption key management must be independent of network configuration such that the
confidentiality of Post Office Ltd traffic is not compromised by a single configuration error of
either the WAN or the encryption system.

All cryptographic keys must be protected against unauthorised use, modification, loss, and
destruction. In addition, secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized disclosure.

Equipment used to generate, store and archive keys must be physically protected.

It must be possible to recover the system to a secure operating state from the compromise of
any key that could directly or indirectly expose plain text PIN values.

12.3.2 Key Management

A structured approach to Key Management will be implemented across all Services provided to
POL. This must ensure that Keys are held securely and that unauthorised Users or systems must
not be able to deduce or use the key material. The following controls will be implemented to
protect cryptographic keys.:

e Key material (symmetric keys, RSA private keys and entropy) must be held in clear only
when in physically secure environments.

e Public keys (except for the Certificate Authority's (CA) public key) must be held in
certificates signed by the Certification Authority.

e Symmetric keys must only be stored where necessary, and be held securely.
e PIN encipherment keys must not be used for any other cryptographic purpose.

e Keys (or part keys) held in filestore must be in a separate filestore accessible only to
authorised key custodians via authorised applications.

e Keys used for protecting data must not be resident in filestore in clear.

e Replay of encrypted PIN values will be prevented including over the pin pad to counter
terminal interface.

e Keys lifetimes must be reviewed annually and must be changed periodically according to
Government Specified Algorithm policy or, where commercial algorithms are employed,
in accordance with industry recognised timescales. Keys are also be checked as part of
RMGA compliance on an annual basis. Different periods may apply to Symmetric Keys
used for encrypting data, Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) used to encrypt other keys and
Certification Authority keys.

e New KEKs must not be distributed solely under the protection of existing KEKs.

e Key material in transit electronically must be encrypted (except for CHAP keys between
the routers within the RMGA Data Centre LAN).

e Cryptographic keys are either installed locally at the machine where they are to be
used, or are distributed electronically using an approved protocol which protects these
keys in transit.

e Where a key is delivered in two parts, e.g. a red key and a black key, the parts must be
delivered by different routes.

use. Access to this must be authorised and recorded in conformance with RMGA
procedures.

e The creation, handling, transmission and storage of keys must be undertaken in
accordance with 1SO11568 Parts 1 to 3. (ISO 11568-1:2005 specifies the principles for
the management of keys used in cryptosystems implemented within the retail-banking
environment). Key generation must be undertaken on standalone workstations or other
hardware units within a physically secure environment.

e Any new PIN processing devices at Data Centres must also comply with FIPS 140-2
Level 3. (FIPS is the Federal Information Processing Standards publication and 140 -2
references the Security requirements for Cryptographic Modules)

In addition, the following policies also apply to the management of the Network Banking Service
(NBS) and HNG-x related keys:

* Key generation and management must comply with IS011568 Parts 1 to 3.

e All keys that may directly or indirectly reveal a plain text PIN must be generated,
handled, transcribed and stored in a way which ensures that no one individual has
access to all key parts.

e PINs and any cryptographic key that may directly or indirectly reveal them must never
appear in plain text outside a tamper detecting hardware security device complying with
the relevant section of ISO9564. (ISO 9564 specifies the basic principles and techniques
which provide the minimum security measures required for effective international PIN
management). Modules handling PINs or keys associated with multiple PIN Pads must
conform to FIPS 140-2 level 3.

e Devices used to generate keys associated with PIN encryption and PIN Pad loading
must be physically secure and conform to agreed standards.

12.4 Security of System Files

12.4.1 Control of Operational Software

Where RMGA uses proprietary software it must be within the terms of the licence conditions.
Unauthorised copying or distribution of software and documentation is prohibited.

RMGA’s configuration management system will maintain an inventory of all proprietary software
used by all services.

During all security patch remediation processes the ability to regress is required. If regression
occurs an incident report must be sent to CS Operations and they will then need to place this on
the risk register for consideration as to what other shielding technique is used.

The RMGA Operational and Change Management Processes must be utilised at all times to
ensure that no changes are made to operational software or documentation without authorisation
and a regression facility.

For all systems that process or store Cardholder Data, File Integrity Monitoring must be used at
least once per week to detect unauthorised changes to critical system, application and
configuration files. The exclusion of files in this environment from the File Integrity Monitoring
process must be formally documented and justified.

12.5.1 Change Control Procedures

Design and specification changes must be reviewed to ensure they do not compromise the
security of the systems.

There must be strict control over the implementation of changes to the software or hardware of
any RMGA system, application or network. The operational change process must ensure that
changes do not compromise any security or control procedure. Development controls must
include processes that ensure new or revised programs are coded using secure coding
techniques and do not contain known flaws or vulnerabilities

All changes to the system, operating system, and programs must be subject to the RMGA formal
operational change process and must be approved before commencement.

All proposed changes to RMGA systems must consider information security as part of the impact
assessment. Where changes are significant then formal risk assessment must take place.
RMGA Security must be consulted on all aspects of information security and risk assessment.

The operational change process must ensure that existing security and control procedures are
not compromised, that support programmers are given access only to those parts of the system
necessary for their work, and that formal agreement and approval for any change is obtained.

12.5.2 Technical Review of Applications after Operating System
Changes

Prior to any operating system upgrade or change, a review of all application control and integrity
procedures must be carried out to ensure that they cannot be compromised by the proposed

Weaknesses

13.1.1. Reporting Information Security Events

Information security events must be reported through the RMGA Service desk, or via FJ 7799
for supporting systems, as quickly as possible. Incidents arising from FJ corporate that may
affect the support of RMGA must be reported within 1 day to the Operational Security Manager.

A formal information security event reporting procedure must be established, in line with the
incident management process which includes an incident response and escalation procedure,
setting out the action to be taken on receipt of a report of an information security event.

Incidents that threaten Cardholder Data and Sensitive Authentication Data must be acted upon
as outlined in the incident management process Ref SVM/SDM/PRO/0018.

All security incidents reported to the Service Desk must be logged and given a reference and
handled in accordance with the incident management process.

All RMGA Staff will be made aware of their responsibility to report any information security
events and suspected breaches as quickly as possible.

13.1.2 Reporting Security Weaknesses

RMGA has established effective procedures for reporting, acting upon and escalating all security
incidents/ breaches that could affect security. It is the responsibility of all users of the RMGA
services and RMGA personnel to use these procedures. [Ref: SVM/SDM/PRO/0018]

All security weaknesses must be recorded with a unique reference number, investigated and
resolved in accordance with these procedures. The Operational Security Manager or CISO will
liaise with Post Office Security staff to review all POL relevant incidents and actions.

If RMGA Staff identify or suspect that a security weakness exists anywhere in the RMGA system
then they must report these matters to the RMGA Service Desk, or direct to the Operational
Security Manager, as quickly as possible in order to prevent information security Incidents.

All RMGA staff must be aware that they should not, in any circumstances, attempt to prove a
suspected weakness themselves. If such a course of action resulted in a security Incident then it
may be treated as a disciplinary issue.

13.2 Management of Information Security Incidents and
Improvements

13.2.1 Responsibilities and Procedures

In addition to reporting of information security events and weaknesses, the monitoring of
systems, alerts, and vulnerabilities shall be used to detect information security Incidents.

investigations on a regular basis and create a summary report highlighting all security incidents.
The report must also highlight any trends or weaknesses which may need to be raised at future
Security Forums.

13.1.3 Collection of Evidence

Where a follow-up action against a person or organization after an information security incident
involves or may involve legal action (either civil or criminal), evidence will be collected, retained,
and presented to conform to the rules for evidence laid down in the relevant jurisdiction(s). Legal
action may also be initiated by 3% parties e.g. by regulatory bodies or controllers of potentially
compromised sensitive information.

Should it be considered necessary the incident might be passed to an external investigator or
forensics team, who will ensure that any data required for evidential purposes is captured and
investigated using a systematic approach which ensures that an auditable record of evidence is
maintained and can be retrieved

Incident investigation procedures must ensure that evidence is collected such that it is
admissible and of sufficient weight by keeping original documents, copies of information held on
hard discs, removable media and log files.

The objective of this policy section is to counteract interruptions to RMGA business activities and
to protect critical business operations from the effects of major failures of information systems or
disasters and to ensure their timely resumption.

14.1 Information security aspects of business continuity

14.1.1 Including information security in the business continuity
management process

A managed process must be developed and maintained for business continuity throughout
RMGA.

The RMGA Business Continuity Manager is responsible for ensuring that a process is
implemented to minimize the impact on the RMGA and delivery of The Services and recover
from loss of information assets. This process will identify the critical business processes and
integrate the information security management requirements of RMGA business operations with
other continuity requirements.

The RMGA Chief Information Security Officer will be involved in the development and
maintenance of the process, and any continuity plans, to ensure that information security
requirements are adequately addressed.

14.1.2 Business continuity and risk assessment

Events that can cause interruptions to business processes shall be identified, along with the
probability and impact of such interruptions and any consequences for information security.

The consequences of disasters, security failures, loss of service, and service availability must be
subject to a business impact analysis.

Business continuity management will include controls to identify and reduce risks, in addition to
the general risks assessment process, limit the consequences of damaging incidents, and ensure
that information required for business processes is readily available.

14.1.3 Developing and implementing continuity plans including
information security

A Business Continuity Plan must be developed and implemented to ensure timely resumption of
essential operations. Information security will be an integral part of the overall business
continuity process.

RMGA Business Continuity Manager must ensure that an effective business continuity plan is
agreed with RMGA Security staff and implemented to reduce the risks from deliberate or
accidental threats to deny access to vital services or information including deliberate loss of
confidentiality and integrity of RMGA assets.

Plans must be established, and maintained, to enable internal operations and business services
to be maintained following failure or damage to vital services, facilities or information.

All relevant security provisions must be maintained, even if degraded conditions are in effect. If
alternative temporary locations are used, the level of implemented security controls at these
locations should be equivalent to the main site(s).

In order to minimise any disruption to the Services managed by RMGA, continuity plans will
encompass:

e Handling emergency situations;

e Operating in fall-back mode;

e Recovery (or Business Resumption) to full operational status
e The escalation plan and the conditions for its activation; and
e Responsibilities for executing each component of the plan.

Business continuity plans will address RMGA vulnerabilities and therefore may contain sensitive
information that needs to be appropriately protected. BC Plans must be stored off-site in secure
conditions but readily available in the event of the need to activate them.

14.1.4 Business continuity planning framework

The Fujitsu Services RMG Account will maintain a framework of business continuity plans,
integrated with Fujitsu Services Corporate plans and, with the plans of the customer where it is
required, ensuring that all plans are consistent, and to identifying priorities for testing and
maintenance.

14.1.5 Testing, maintaining and re-assessing business continuity
plans

The RMGA Business Continuity Manager is responsible for ensuring that the BC Plan is regularly
reviewed.

The identification of changes in business arrangements not yet reflected in the business
continuity plans will be followed by an appropriate update of the plan. This formal change control
process will ensure that the updated plans are distributed and reinforced by regular reviews of
the complete plan.

Business continuity plans must be tested under representative operational conditions and
updated regularly to ensure that they are up to date and effective. The test schedule for business
continuity plan will indicate how and when each element of the plan will be tested. External
suppliers of key services must be included in tests to ensure that risks are minimised, wherever
RMGA is dependent upon subcontractors (or third parties), for essential services or supplies.

Tests of business continuity plan will ensure that all members of the recovery team and other
relevant RMGA Staff are aware of the plans and their responsibility for business continuity and
information security and know their role when a plan is invoked.

The RMGA Business Continuity Manager and Chief Information Security Officer must be
satisfied that continuity arrangements of external suppliers of key facilities and services are
sufficient to ensure that RMGA will meet its contracted commitment for information security to
the customer.

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

RMGA is required to comply with legislative requirements and commercial standards. The
controls defined in 18027001 are designed to provide a sound baseline for commercial
organisations of many types.

Through the implementation of this policy, RMGA will apply I[SO27001 to provide a baseline
definition for information security encompassing the eleven categories of controls in the context
of the RMGA Service.

The RMGA Information Security Policy will encompass and comply with all security aspects of
customer requirements as defined in relevant Contract Schedules and the Community
Information Security Policy,. Being a high level policy, in many cases one policy statement may
cover a number of the detailed requirements as laid down in these schedules.

15.1 Compliance with legal requirements

Fujitsu Services is required to comply with legislative requirements and technical and
commercial standards in its own right as a business organisation. In addition RMGA provides a
managed service for POL; in this case POL may have additional legal and regulatory
requirements imposed upon them. These legal and regulatory obligations are passed down to
RMGA within the contractual agreement as specific implementation requirements. Relevant
POL requirements as expressed in the CISP have already been included within the specific
policies, which are mandatory.

15.1.1 Identification of applicable legislation

It is the customer responsibility to explicitly define, document, and keep up to date all relevant
statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements for HNG X Services. The provision of
facilities to enable the customer to discharge its own legal and regulatory obligations must be
explicitly provided through requirements statements in the normal way.

RMGA will document its approach to meet these requirements.

Implementation advice on Fujitsu’s legal responsibilities is provided by Fujitsu Group Legal
department.

15.1.2 Intellectual property rights (IPR)

The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 states “The owner of the copyright has the
exclusive right to copy the work." It is illegal to copy software without the copyright owner's
permission.

Proprietary software must be used within the terms of the licence conditions. Unauthorised
copying of software and documentation is prohibited.

Where practicable vendor-supplied software packages shall be used without modification. If
changes are deemed necessary, these should first be requested under change control to the
original supplier and implemented as an upgrade from the supplier.

RMGA will not permit any modified or non-standard software components to be incorporated.
An inventory of all proprietary software used by the Services will be maintained.

Data will be retrievable to meet legal requirements as requested by a court of law, e.g. records
required can be retrieved in an acceptable timeframe and in an acceptable format.

15.1.4 Data protection and privacy of personal data

It is Fujitsu Services’ clearly stated policy to comply with all laws and regulations relating to the
protection of personal data in all countries in which it transacts business and to maintain a high
standard of compliance in all its worldwide operations.

All applications handling personal data on individuals must comply with data protection
legislation and principles. RMGA shall process personal data only in accordance with the
instructions of each Data Controller as set out in the Agreement and applicable provisions of
CCDs dealing with such processing.

15.1.5 Prevention of misuse of information processing facilities
Users shall be deterred from using information processing facilities for unauthorized purposes.

Under the Computer Misuse Act, it is an offence to access or modify material without proper
authority, or to access material with intent to commit further offences. Warning notices to this
effect must be displayed to potential users prior to system log-on.

15.1.6 Regulation of cryptographic controls

RMGA will only use cryptographic techniques as defined by RIPA within the Services that are
compliant with POL cryptographic policies and standards as referenced in CISP under section
relating to Cryptographic Controls.

15.2 Compliance with security policies and standards
and technical compliance

15.2.1 Compliance with security policies and standards

Compliance with the requirements defined in the RMGA Information Security Policy is
mandatory. The policy is to be applied throughout RMGA for the secure management and
operation of all systems and Services designed, built, implemented, operated, used, supplied or
managed by the Fujitsu Services RMG Account.

Regular audits are carried out under the direction of RMGA CISO and/or RMGA Programme
Assurance Manager, to verify that RMGA is operating in accordance with its security policy and
procedures.

Security Audits can also be initiated by Post Office Limited, its clients or regulators either in
response to a specific incident or on a regular basis.

These audits will form part of an overall assurance programme and will be scheduled, co-
ordinated, reported and corrective action plans acted on as part of an integrated audit schedule

Where relevant, RMGA will comply with customer security requirements as expressed in the
Community Information Security Policy. They do not need to comply with requirements in the
CISP addressed specifically to other parties.

15.2.2 Technical compliance checking

RMGA Information systems must be regularly checked for compliance with security
implementation standards and regulatory requirements. Technical compliance checking involves
the examination of operational systems to ensure that hardware and software controls have been
correctly implemented. An external auditor will annually audit the card holder environment to
ensure compliance. This type of compliance checking requires specialist technical assistance. It
shall be performed manually (supported by appropriate software tools, if necessary) by an
experienced system engineer, or by an automated software package which generates a technical
report for subsequent interpretation by a technical specialist.

Compliance checking also covers, for example, penetration testing, which might be carried out
by independent experts specifically contracted for this purpose. Caution should be exercised in
case success of a penetration test could lead to a compromise of the security of the system and
inadvertently exploit other vulnerabilities.

Any technical compliance check shall only be carried out by, or under the supervision of,
competent, persons authorised by the RMGA CISO.

Technical compliance checking will form part of an overall assurance programme and will be
scheduled and co-ordinated as part of an integrated audit programme.

15.3 Information systems audit considerations

15.3.1 Information system audit controls

RMGA Services will be developed to ensure that customer requirements for audit controls are
met.

RMGA systems used to support the Services will consider the following when implementing audit
controls:

e All security critical events are time stamped and recorded;

e Auditable events are carefully selected to minimise overheads;
e Audit trail information is protected from modification;

e Audit trails include a record of all significant system changes;
e Effective audit analysis reduction and analysis tools are used;
e All observed system irregularities are investigated; and

e Audit trails are archived and stored for an agreed duration.

15.3.2 Protection of information system audit tools

System audit tools (programs and log files) will only be available to authorised personnel and will
be protected to prevent any possible misuse or compromise.
