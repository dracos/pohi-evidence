There is nothing in Option B which gives the reader an indication of the size of the claims which Post Office faces.
Would it not be more transparent and complete if there was something which revealed the scale of the claims, but
made clear that these are unsubstantiated?

This is ultimately a subjective assessment, but I think however the wording in Option B is put (and I agree the wording

below does not mislead), the omission of any indication of scale is what is missing from the summary.

To deal with the concern, in option B, suggest the middle paragraph says:

The Court has ordered two trials to be heard in 2018-19 to determine a subset of the
preliminary issues in dispute between the parties. The Court has not yet ordered a process for
determining any issues of liability or quantum. To date, the Claimants have not definitively
stated the value of their claims in any Particulars of Claim nor have the Claimants provided the
information that would enable the Directors to assess the value of their claims.

As we discussed, suggest a response along the lines of the below. Elizabeth, would appreciate your thoughts on this.

I would be hesitant to include the highlighted wording in Version B. While this works well in the context of Version A, I
would be concerned that it might be misleading in Version B as it could imply that the Claimants have not yet given
any indication of the aggregate claim value.

Many thanks

All
Further to the meeting of the ARC last Thursday, I now attach for your review and comment, revised
wording for the proposed disclosure regarding the Postmaster Litigation in the note to the Accounts on

contingent liabilities.

The EY panel is scheduled for late next Wednesday afternoon and we are therefore keen to get the
proposed wording to them as soon as possible.

Please let me know if you have any comments.
Kind regards,

Jane
