Hello

At teamtalk extra last Monday, I promised to let you know the
feedback we've had.

The BBC's Signed, Sealed, Delivered: Inside the Post Office
documentary put us firmly in the spotlight.

most watched all three. Nearly two-thirds said we made the right
decision to work with the BBC to show the challenges we face. Many
colleagues did, however, say they felt some concern after watching the
programmes and felt we were portrayed negatively.

There were 1,156 posts on social media during the three episodes,
with the highest number in episode one. Perhaps understandably,
across the three weeks negative sentiment on social media was
considerably higher than usual. However, most of the negative posts
during the shows were from a handful of people.

Our Insight research showed a more positive impact on customers’

views, with 43% saying they felt a lot or a little more positive about
Post Office and less than a third saying the programme made them

feel more negative.

The series was certainly a success in raising public awareness of our
modernisation programme and the challenges we face.

More than three in five customers said they were more willing to bear
with us while we make the changes. They also said the message that
Post Office is trying hard to become less reliant on government
subsidies definitely came across.

More than half of customers strongly agreed Post Office is trying to
change for the better, and they were more aware of the challenges we
face as a result of the documentary. Similarly, a YouGov poll showed
that 8% more people were aware of our modernisation programme at
the end of the series.

We should be incredibly proud that our people and the public feel so
passionately about the Post Office. That really came across throughout
the series, with show-stealers like the Sadanas and Elliot Jacobs,
among many others, bringing their dedication and determination to
succeed into the nation’s living rooms.

Hot on its heels, of course, came Monday’s Panorama, and its
unsubstantiated allegations about the business.

A YouGov poll showed a slight drop in people’s trust - 71% agreed the
Post Office is a responsible and trusted organisation, down from 79%
before the programme.

On the day, the number of brand mentions on social media was about
the same as during the three-part series. We saw 978 posts on the
night specifically related to Panorama, but less than 250 of these were
negative, and there were more than 80 positive posts.

The programme was one-sided and would have come across as very
emotive to those not close to the issue. It did not produce anything we
weren't already familiar with, but there is, of course, so much more to
it that went unreported.
