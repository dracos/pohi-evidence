All

Just had 10 mins with BIS on phone. The headlines :

Atmospherics - warm, straight talking, friendly and sense of joint endeavour.
Substance -

a) 25 of 30 mins devoted to his impressions of POL and challenges/opportunities in front of it, drawing on some of the matters raised
at Board last week

b) Sparrow - TP provided update. Report being prepared by his QC. Likely to be 9 (think this was a simple error - the number is 8)
which would be taken up though some (ie on IT) might not be technically feasible. Acceptance on both sides that it would be
impossible to please everyone, no matter what was done. There will be inevitable accusations of whitewash, lack of independence
etc, which would need to be ridden out by both POL and BIS. Tim reported on meetings with JA (not as excitable as he thought he
might be) and SS. BNR has bumped into JA frequently in Lords and he has not once raised the issue with her. Short discussion,
initiated by TP I think, about the thought that would need to be given to some form of public document to close this down. Key take
away - both agreed the issue was losing potency and dying away. I have agreed to keep BIS updated at relevant junctures but we will
do so on our terms.

c) Accounting issue - I believe this took up the remaining 2 mins but have no detail.
Best wishes
Patrick
