IF} Response :

lhe cause of the problems in all three CAPs at this outlet was the fact that
stock Unit DD's rollover records from CAP 5 to CAP 6 represented a ‘nil’
balance (the total stock holding was nil, no receipts or payment transactions
ere recorded) despite the fact that the stock unit had been trading normally
luring the period. This issue was raised in PinICL 43811 and is still under
investigation within the EPOSS Development team.

he fact that Stock Unit DDs transactions and stock holdings were omitted
from the CAP 5 Cash Account meant that the Brought Forward value for the
ffice in CAP 6 was incorrect. This caused the CAP 6 Cash Account to
nisbalance.

it am still investigating why the CAP 7 Cash Account misbalanced, but I note
that the office returned to a balanced position in CAP 8.

lbate: 30-May-2000 1.
I} Response :
30/5/00: On further investigation, the same problem that affected stock unit
ID in CAPS affected Stock Unit TT in CAP 6, i.e. at balancing time the system
failed to record the correct stock holding for the stock unit and failed to
rite the summary totals for the Receipts and Payments products. The only
records written were the declared Cash and Stamp holdings with a discrepancy
lcquivalent to these amounts. This failure will have compounded the CAP 6
jproblem with stock unit DD and then generated a further discrepancy in CAP 7.
It am passing the call to EPOSS-FP so that the message store evidence of the
problem in both these CAPs can be examined.

helped? How?

It have been asked by Walter Wright to submit more detail and I also note
\iohn's queries; in response to these first:

hl. We can reconstruct the Cashaccount at some point but I do not believe this
to be an 'L1HOT' issue, I think this will have to queued up and reprioritised
(or cloned specifcally for this issue).

2. The diagnostics have been useful for PINICLs such as this becuase have
ave confirmed what we have suspected, in that records have failed to be
lretrieved from Riposte calls (when they work perfectly well in development).
3. Code has been issued at C14 which will back the user out from key phases
lof rolover should the system detect that rposte readied retrievals have
failed to yield data.

jt don't think I'm being premature in revealing that we think we know know why
these failures with Dataserver are occrring. Steve Warwick experienced such a
failure on a rig he was testing against and found the root cause was that
larchiving was active during a riposte query; this only occurs ‘out-of-hours!
Jat the end of each working day. Archiving will occur 'in-hours' should the
counter have been switch off over night for 7 condecutive days and hence the
lsprordic nature of these incidents (or where PM's do their balancing near the
archiving time at 10pm.)

lew evidence added - Resurrected CAP 5 cash account data.

I} Response =

It proved to be very difficult to resurrect the cash account data for week 5.
steve Warwick's analysis tool showed that not only was stock unit DD corrupt
ut also stock unit XXX. EPOSS nodes 91579999 and 90029999 were missing and
had to be resurrected.

In the end the reconciliation code was adapted to give data for every
cashAccLine with the exception of 99990001 which is the receipts balance
bought forward; but that can be calculated by looking at the receipts total
lérom the previous CAP CashAccLine 99990700.

fhe resurrected figures are given in the attached file CAPS.

the lines containing <Application:EPOSSWeek1yDump><DumpOf :AccumulatedFigures>
lgive the recalculated values for each CashAccLine. They contain the
asbAccLine number with a prefix giving the table number. Note that lines
189990701 and 99990702 can not be trusted absolutely but their sum will be
correct for the overall discrepancy table value.

lan alternative way of looking at the results is to look at the lines
containing

App] icat ion: EPOSSWeek1yRecon><EPOSSTransact ion: <TranType:WeeklyCAErr>. They
give the original and r
wong ~ all other lines in the cash account would have been correct. Note
that lines 99990701 and 99990702 are not included in this set.

I} Response :

It am not sure it is worth spending time trying to resurect the other CAPs.
[the method I have derived assumes that the CashAccLines for the previous CAP.
II see from Steve Warwicks's analysis that CAP 6 was not correct as well. Now
if I rerun the tool I have developed on CAP 6 it will use as its base line
the CashAcchine figures in CAP 5 which we know are wrong and I have just
lrecalculated. I think therefore that enough time has been spent on this
problem and it is not cost effective to proceed further. However in future
here there is a problem with just one CAP we should be able to resurect the
figures more easily.
