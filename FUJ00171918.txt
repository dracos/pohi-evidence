this has been affected by the same issue as Peak PC0275563. It is an EUM issue whilst rolling the branch TP whilst attached to a
lstock unit in the last TP.

Development have recreated this issue in test. It is related to the BUM locking changes recently released to live.

h) Do some transactions in the SU e.g. that change the cash position
b) Lock counter A

3) Login as same HUID on counter B

a) Rollover stock unit into new TP

Is) Lock B

6) Unlock A with same HUID, same SU

7) A think SU is in old TP

ls) Roll branch

Is) BANG! Non zero trading position. CFwd figures wrongly-BFwd

jote that the BT

figures written to the BRDB are correct, and the next SU balance report and BTS trading statement are fine.

Until the fix has completed development and release to live we have implemented a couple of monitors.
Ht) A core hours monitor in HORIce which will identify and alert to any non-zero TP. (KEL wbra254M)

2) An overnight report that lists all occurrences the previous day and identifies if the cash BF = cash CF. This is emailed to
the Ssc manager for progressing.

le have checked that the suspense figures are correct for this branch (details above). The ‘corrupted’ BTS reprint has been

lshared with the Post Office.
