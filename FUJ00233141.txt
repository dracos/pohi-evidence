1 Background & Introduction

This document pulls together the many working processes from many teams to present a consolidated
view of the POA end-to-end process of Live Defect Management (LDM).

It describes how the systems should be used and how various teams need to interact to ensure an
effective end-to-end process is followed, tracked and reported on.

LDM uses the POA Peak system. Live Defects must be recorded as Peaks.

The processes described in this document align to the 2021 definition of a Defect as agreed with Post
Office Limited (POL).

1.1. Ownership

The LDM process is owned by the POA Defect & Service Process Manager.

1.2 Scope

LDM relates to the Live system. LDM does not cover the management of test defects raised during the
Software Delivery LifeCycle (SDLC) as these are managed under their own test defect management
processes. If a defect is found during the SDLC that relates to the Live system (as defined below) then
that defect will be treated as a Live Defect and will be managed following the LDM process described in
this document.

1.3 Definitions of Live Defect and HDR Defect

Fujitsu uses 2 definitions of a Defect to allow it to track entries in its systems: a Live Defect; and a HDR
Defect. These definitions were agreed with POL to ensure consistency in reporting and language and
POL then included these in its “POL Horizon Defects Review Terms of Reference” document. “Bugs.
Errors and Defects” are collectively referred to as Defects.

Both defined Defect types are made visible by using tags in the Fujitsu TfSNow and Peak systems.
A Live Defect is defined as an issue that:

+ Is present on a LIVE system

+ — Is within Fujitsu's scope of obligations

+ — Is, or appears to be, inconsistent with the agreed design or service specification

+ — Is, therefore, a fault that is likely to need fixing

A HDR Defect is defined as a Live Defect that also has at least 1 of the following attributes (HDR
Defects):

+ Affects, or has the potential to affect, branch financial outcomes

+ Affects, or has the potential to affect, the way a postmaster is required to use the system (User
Interface, Report, Function)

+ Affects, or has the potential to affect, the experience of a Post Office customer or client

HDR Defects are classed as either “Financial” impacting (which POL call “Impact” and Fujitsu call
“Financial”) or “Experience” impacting (which we both call “Experience”).

Throughout this document, there are additional terms and phrases that apply. The key ones are:

« HDR Forum — a weekly meeting with POL to review HDR Defects. POL need to know the HDR
Defects and their status. It is understood that POL share this with postmasters. This is a very
important meeting that sees Fujitsu and POL aligned on the HDR Defects.

e Investigation Peak/Potential Live Defect (Peak) — is an Incident that is being investigated
where the cause and required action are not yet confirmed. A linked TfSNow Incident may well
exist — and MUST exist if POL need to be aware.

e Defect Peak — is a new Peak that is not linked to a TfSNow Incident (but is created from the
Investigation Peak/Potential Live Defect Peak so it carries all the required historical data) and
that describes a confirmed Live Defect where the cause and required action to fix are known. The
investigation has concluded.

e Knowledge Base (KB)/Knowledge Base Article (KBA) — The Knowledge Base is an
information repository used for support purposes. Knowledge Base Articles are descriptions of
aspects of the system that have been recorded to help support staff. The term Known Error Log
(KEL) is no longer used. Live Defects are NOT managed using the Knowledge Base but there
may be KBAs that describe aspects of Live Defects.

2 Live Defect Management

2.1 Principles

When an Incident is raised it can become a Live Defect. The management of Incidents is therefore a
critical initial step in the LDM process.

e Live Defect Management is owned by the POA Defect & Service Process Manager.
e Live Defects must be recorded as Peaks and managed using the Peak system.
e Fujitsu uses Peak references for Live Defects, not TfSNow Problem references.

e Live Service is always the priority so Live Defects take priority over Project work — including
during the investigation stage. Conflict is to be escalated and handled by management.

e POA must know how many Live Defects and HDR Defects there are at any point in time.

« POA must be able to differentiate between Live Defects that are still being investigated and are
not confirmed, and Live Defects that have been confirmed and require action to resolve.

e POA needs to know the status of all Live Defects and whether there are any issues needing
attention.

e — If.an Incident relates to the Live environment, then it is treated as a Live Defect until proven
otherwise.

e When raised in Peak, it has the LiveAffectingDefect tag added for easier identification and
tracking.

e The required fields and tags within Peak must be kept up to date to enable tracking of status and
reporting of progress (see Appendix A — Key Fields in Peak).

The status of all Live Defects must be always known and must be reported to POL.
e All POA support teams must ensure progress is being made on items in their stacks.
« POA must always seek to identify a workaround for confirmed Live Defects - and update Peak.

e Every confirmed Live Defect must be targeted at a numbered release as early as possible so it is
clear when the fix will be deployed (refer to Appendix E — Deploying Fixes via Release
Management):

o Some fixes need to be deployed outside of the release process and via operational
change (refer to Appendix F — Deploying Fixes outside of Release Management).

e Releases without dates must be escalated to POA management and POL until a date is
assigned. This can be mitigated with pre-agreed maintenance release schedules.

e If POL postpones a scheduled maintenance release, then this is a POL decision and the release
deployment date will be updated.

e If POL cancels a scheduled maintenance release, then this is a POL decision and any confirmed
Live Defects within that proposed release become temporarily accepted defects by POL.

2.2 Tagging

An Incident is defined in the HNG-X contract as “any perceived abnormal or undesirable occurrence
relating to the Services”. Incident Management procedures are defined in “SVM/SDM/PRO/0018 - POA.
Operations Incident Management Procedure”, “SVM/SDM/PRO/001 — POA Operations Major Incident
Procedure” and “SVM/SDM/PRO/0875 - Application Support Strategy”.

Any party may raise an Incident:

+ If the Incident meets the criteria of a Live Defect, then it must be progressed to Peak and be
assigned the ##LiveAffecting Defect tag.

+ If the Incident meets the criteria of a HDR Defect, then it must be progressed to Peak and be
additionally assigned the HDR-Fin or HDR-Exp tag.

The key fields within the Incident then allow the tracking of the progress of the Live Defect to its
resolution (or qualification out) and enable all reporting. Refer to Appendix A — Key Fields in Peak.

2.3 Live Defect stages

As a Live Defect progresses through the process and its fields in Peak are amended as required, the Live
Defect will pass through these stages:

needed
1. INVESTIGATING - A Live Defect will start out as a potential Live Defect until sufficient
investigation has taken place.

2. SOLUTIONING - If a fault is confirmed then this will progress to be a confirmed Live Defect (if it
is not a fault then the potential Live Defect will be closed).

3. PROPOSED FOR - Once a solution is identified for a confirmed Live Defect it will need to go
through the POA processes before the fix is assigned to an appropriate release. It will initially be
proposed for inclusion in a future release.

4. TARGETED AT - Once the release is confirmed, the Peak will be Targeted At that release.
Releases are then managed through to deployment to Live.

5. ACCEPTED DEFECT - Accepted Defect is a Defect that has been discussed by Fujitsu and POL
and it has been jointly agreed that no further actions will be performed i.e. accepted as not being
fixed.

2.4 Managing the Defect

The following is a guide to managing Live Defects:

= information and tracking

« All Live Defects must have a clear next action stated that can be tracked.

e All Live Defects must be always owned by a team whose manager will ensure actions are being
taken (this can be a different team throughout the lifetime of the Live Defect).

e Live Defects that are not classified as HDR Defects are managed internally by Fujitsu using
Peak. Reports will be available for POL to show overall progress.

« When a HDR Defect is being investigated there will be a TfSNow Incident open and bonded.
POL will track status by referring to their ServiceNow Incident. All progress on the investigation is
to be added to the TfSNow Incident so that it is visible to POL in their corresponding ServiceNow
Incident. It is POL's responsibility to keep its own internal HDR Defect records up to date.

e If Fujitsu completes its investigation and confirms there is no HDR Defect, then the investigation
Peak and Incident will be closed with no further actions required. It will then be excluded from
Live Defect counts in the future. The HDR-* Collection should remain, so it is known that it was
considered within the HDR Forum.

e When a HDR Defect is confirmed as a Fujitsu owned Live Defect, then a new defect Peak will be
created that summarises the fault and the required fix and carries all the required key field data
items. The defect Peak reference will be added to the investigation Peak which will then replicate
to the TfSNow Incident. The investigation Peak will be closed along with the TfSNow Incident.
Fujitsu will then manage the progress of the Live Defect in Peak and will provide status update
reports from Peak that will be shared with POL for POL to use as part of the weekly HDR Forum.

e Peaks that have been tested successfully and are still to be deployed must not be closed and
must be routed to the Peak stack RM-x and assigned to “Release to Live” so it is clear that the
Live Defect is still present in the system but that its fix has been tested and is awaiting release.

e Several Response Category field values are considered No Fault Found. See Appendix C — No
Fault Found Response Categories in Peak and “SVM/SDM/PRO/0875 - Application Support
Strategy’.

e If adecision is made that progressing a Live Defect is not the best option (for example the
feature is being migrated and any fix would serve little purpose) then we should act as follows:

o If there is a Live Defect then Fujitsu should assume an obligation to fix it.

o If Fujitsu does not believe a fix is the best option, then it must get permission not to
create and deploy a fix.

o Such permission can be from POL (ideally and especially if it is a Live Defect that would
in any way affect how POL uses the solution) or from POA Delivery Executive (DE)
(where the only impacted entity is Fujitsu).

o The Response Category on the Live Defect Peak must be changed to “Accepted Live
Defect” (so it is treated as a no action Peak).

o “Accepted Live Defects” will appear on all POA and POL Live Defect reports.

2.5 Reporting
Fujitsu provides a variety of reports to different audiences:
+ All HDR Defects to POL — at the POL chaired weekly HDR Forum meeting.
+ All Live Defects to POL fortnightly.
+ All Live Defects (comprising all HDR Defects) — for the monthly POA Business Review.
+ All Live Defects to the POA stack owners and POA management teams monthly.

Refer to SVM/SDM/PRO/4695 — Horizon Defect Management Reporting for additional details on how the
reports mentioned are created.

2.6 Data checking

The tagging of Live Defect and HDR Defect Peaks relies on many manual actions which can be
susceptible to human error or interpretation. To mitigate this, there are a series of overlapping and inter-
connecting processes performed by separate people and teams that significantly reduce the potential for
omission or mistakes to go uncorrected. This provides high reliability to the LDM tagging and resulting
processes.

« Peak owners are required to keep the Peaks updated and the key fields up to date.

e Checks are made by stack owners as part of their Incident Management actions (see Appendix B
— Checklists for TfSNow & Peak Stack owners).

e The chairs of key meetings such as the Business Impact Forum (BIF) and the Peak Targeting
Forum (PTF) check field values.

e The Major Account Controller (MAC) team perform periodic checks following a local work
instruction to ensure the Peak key fields are being constantly checked for data inconsistencies,
challenging the Peak owners to make required corrections (e.g. a fix has been deployed ina
release in the past, but the Live Defect Peak has not yet been closed).

e The regular reporting extracts also serve to ensure the key fields and tagging is regularly
checked. Any inconsistencies are challenged and updated.

Combining the extensive level of awareness within the support teams with the many additional
overlapping processes means that the identification of Live Defects and HDR Defects is highly reliable.

2.7 Key Meetings

The key meetings that support the LDM process are summarised below. The outcome of BIF/CBIF/PTF
meetings is held in concise notes in the relevant text boxes on the RELEASE MGT tab in Peak. This
enables easy refer backs without the need to source external content.

2.7.1 BIF - Fujitsu internal

e  BIF is a Fujitsu internal meeting that is held every weekday (if required) to ensure prompt
discussion on Peaks ready for group review.

e When a Peak is ready for BIF to consider, the BIF Action flag must be set on the relevant Peak,
so itis identifiable.

e All Peaks with the BIF Action flag set will be reviewed at BIF:
co This will include all defects Peaks with the ##LiveAffectingDefect tag.

o It will also include other Peaks that may relate to other topics such as environments or
Peaks that the Developers wish to discuss at the forum.

e As Peaks are assigned the BIF Action, the support specialist will be presented with a prompt to
ensure they confirm the key data items are correctly set within the Peak. This will ensure that the
BIF meeting can focus on the solution for the Peak and not whether certain key fields on the
Peak are correct:

e Atthe BIF meeting itself, more Key Fields will be checked to ensure the accuracy of the Peak
system. For example, BIF will:

o Ensure Call Type is correct.

o Ensure Workaround field is up to date.

o Ensure Product Group field is up to date.
o Ensure Product field is up to date.

o Ensure Priority field is up to date.

o Ensure Impact field is up to date.

e If a Peak had previously been rejected - as more information was required - then it will have the
BIF Action flag set again when the Developer is ready to re-present their proposal

= The BIF Chair must check if there are conditions that would mean the Peak needs POL input and
hence must go to CBIF. The questions are on the RELEASE MGT tab under the BIF section (see
screenshot below as well as text extract):

e The fix can be done in more than one way and POL would need to guide Fujitsu on
choosing the preferred option.

«The fix may change the functionality of the system and consequently POL will be
required to provide appropriate communication, and potentially training, to the
subpostmasters.

«The fix may need to be done in conjunction with changes performed by some of POL's
other suppliers and POL will need to manage and synchronise that activity.

«The fix may need to be done concurrently with a separate future planned change, due to
the two fixes being logically related, and POL would need to confirm their willingness to
accept any potential delays in deploying the fix.

e The fix may relate to active discussions between Fujitsu and POL on a specific and
separate topic and hence should be discussed within that context (Fujitsu management
discretion).

e Fujitsu does not believe a fix is a sensible option and seeks POL's agreement to record
the circumstances in a KBA only.

o The outcome of PTF discussions should be added to the PTF text box on the RELEASE
MGT tab. A concise note is all that is needed.

e The ideal outcome from PTF is that the Peak (whether a Live Defect or not) is Targeted At a
numbered release.

2.7.3. HDR (including CBIF) — joint Fujitsu and POL meeting

«The HDR Forum (formerly Horizon Known Error Review Forum (HKERF)). This is a critical
meeting where POL and Fujitsu review the progress of all open HDR Defects. It is a joint weekly
forum chaired by POL. A Terms of Reference is owned by Post Office and is also stored in
Dimensions as SVM/SDM/PRO/4317.

2.7.4

Potential HDR Defects will be reported automatically to POL via the service management toolset
replication driven by Fujitsu updates to the TfSNow Incident. An Incident raised and bonded to
describe the potential fault condition being investigated.

Actual HDR Defects (including any deferred) will be shared with POL weekly by an extract report
from Peak that will be sent to POL in advance of the meeting showing the latest update.

If Fujitsu completes its investigation and confirms there is no HDR Defect, then the investigation
Peak and Incident will be closed with no further actions required. POL will be notified of the
reason on the HDR Report and at the weekly HDR Form meeting.

Fujitsu will provide its view of status — from its systems — and manage any difference of opinion
with POL.

The agreed target dataset for reporting a HDR Defect is as follows (as at the date of this report):

The Impact tab in Peak will automatically show this layout if a HDR-* Collection is added. The
content can also be readily extracted to HTML format for sharing or inserting into POL reports.

Fujitsu will provide weekly updates to POL at least one working day prior to the HDR Forum
meeting.

CBIF proposals are also discussed with POL at this forum.

CBIF (part of HDR) — joint Fujitsu and POL meeting

CBIF is a joint meeting with POL and is combined with the HDR Forum meeting.

o Items to be discussed at CBIF must have a “CBIF Proposal” that has been created in
advance using the agreed template (see below) and approval process, so it is clear that
this is what the decision needs to be made on (not additional dialogue during a meeting).
“CBIF Proposal” should be attached to the Peak and also be sent with the HDR weekly
report so that the meeting has the information in advance.

o If the Peak can proceed as discussed at CBIF, then the PTF Action flag will be set.

co If the Peak is to be discussed next time (as POL wish to seek wider feedback within their
own organisation) then the PTF Action flag will not be set as this will cause the Peak to
reappear on the weekly PTF report.

then closed with Response Category “63 -- Final -- Programme approved - No fix

A Appendix — Key Fields in Peak

There are many fields in Peak that help support users to determine status and record information. Many
of those are mandatory or system generated. These remain important and are described in “CS/MAN/011
— Peak User Guide”.

The fields identified below are important to the LDM process and will need to be completed at various
stages of the progress of the Live Defect. The screenshots and description may change over time so this
appendix should be seen as illustrative rather than a definitive and maintained reference.

To help remind Peak users of the importance of Live Defect and HDR Defect Peak updates, a banner
appears on the Peak login screen:

in Peak

Peaks with the following Response Categories are deemed to be No Fault Found as no action was
required to remedy the issue raised. In some cases, this is because the fault is within an area of the
system that is managed using TfSNow and hence Peak is not the source of the Live Defect information.
In other cases, this is because the fault is already being investigated under another Peak.

D Appendix — Cloning Peaks
Cloning processes and rules need to be applied consistently:

e Cloning carries forward all Collections, References and Key Fields and it must show cloned from
and cloned to support chain of events tracking.

e Cloning should be for specific purposes and the reason will appear as a prompt when cloning is
initiated:

o Assignment to GDC (so we can redact/obfuscate)

Note: Since April 2020 UK Bridge do not clone Peaks but instead they obfuscate the
original so it can be widely shared and updated whilst maintaining any links to TfSNow
Incidents.

co Splitting into multiple threads linked to a single origin (e.g. Data Centre & Counter,
phased fix — urgent perhaps by script/refdata and follow-on for code).

o Disassociating from the TfSNow incident (e.g. documentation, follow-on to an initial
response to an Incident).

o Creating the defect Peak to progress the Live Defect to resolution.

o Creating Test Only Peaks where the test in a particular environment can't mirror the
entirety of the issue described e.g. 3rd party connections are not available. This is rare.
Testing is then done on the clone in that environment. The master defect Peak is still
open as it may be used for the full testing in LST. The Test Only Peak will be closed once
testing is completed successfully.

Note: if a Peak has been assigned to a Baseline, then cloning should be done with
caution and include consultation with the Baseline owner in advance

E Appendix — Deploying Fixes via Release
Management

Live Defects, once assigned to a release at BIF/PTF, then follow the POA Release Management
processes. The Release Management Strategy is defined in SVM/SDM/PRO/1520. The following also
needs consideration:

e Release Notes must list all Peaks that are fixed and being deployed. The extract/report must also
show the POLPRB- reference for HDR Defects and the Fujitsu Problem references if they have
been tagged to be tracked by the Problem manager(s). This is achieved by clicking the button to
the right of the listed Peaks in the Release Note which creates an Excel spreadsheet that can

« Release Notes will not list:
othe Peaks that are being deferred (as they are not fixed yet).

o  anyclone Peaks raised by Test for Test Only actions (as these are not additional Live
Defects but are just a tracking mechanism for the Test team).

e The action of deploying the release should set the applicable Peak Status to “F” and alert the
originator that the fix is deployed and ready for them to confirm and close the Peak.

e If arelease has gone Live, then any urgent new Live Defect Peaks must NOT be Targeted At
already deployed releases. A new hotfix release reference should be generated.

e If ahotfix is needed, Release Management will create the hotfix release in Peak with its own set
of dates, so that it can be properly tracked.

e Release Management will maintain the Target Release date table:

co Allpast releases must state the actual release date for deployment (if phased, this
should be the Pilot release date when at least 1 live branch saw new code installed).

o All future releases must show the latest anticipated release date for deployment —
irrespective of who will be leading the deployment.

co The release date should be the first time that the deployment was made to any live
environment (this is currently always Model Office). The date will therefore show the first
time the fix was deployed to a live counter/branch even though a phased rollout may
mean other counters/branches did not receive the fix until a later agreed date.

co The Target Release screen should be used to make universal changes to Peaks when
release information changes — especially the Planned Dates for the whole release. The
dates can be changed and then the “Reset Date” button is used to apply the new date to
all Peaks Targeted At the updated release (see below):

F Appendix — Deploying Fixes outside of Release
Management

If a Peak is being fixed outside of a release — e.g. by operational change by us, or by operational change
to relate to a Worldline deployment then we must update the Peak to Response Category ‘69 — Final —
Network/Operational change complete’.

e If the Peak is Call Type “# -- Defect Identified” then the Peak will check for the existence of the
following References:

= TfSNow with a value starting ‘CHG’.
= Operational Change Date.

e If both are not found, display the following error message:

ss¢2.fs.fujitsu.com says

For a live defect you must add a reference for the "TISNow’ Change and
the ‘Operation Change Date’ before selecting this Final response.

e The support user is expected to add the TfSNow change reference and the expected deployment
date to the Peak.

e If the Peak is not already Targeted At a release, setting this Response Category will now set it as
Targeted At and set the Target Release Type to ‘TFSNOW CHG’.

e If no release record exists, one is created, and the Planned & Actual dates completed. If a
release record already exists, it is updated with the Operational Change Date.

e The Impact page (for non-HDR Defect Peaks) has been updated for the Target Release date
(estimate) to be the Operational Change Date for a TFSNOW CHG release. It did not make
sense for HDR defects (as these do not have the Operational Change Date field).

« An FAQ has been added to Peak too: https://ssc.fs.fujitsu.com/Peak/PeakFAQ jsp#Q73 .

geen ror when aling a eponse cle

For live defect Peak (Call pe ~ Defect Leni), if this into be closed ctside a relate using an Operational Change you mut ensre hat the following References ae aided tthe Peak:

e Both of the TFSNow and Operational Change Date fields are added to the extract spreadsheet
for your and MAC reference.

What this means:

e If Peaks are to go live outside of a release, we must use the ‘69 — Final — Network/Operational

change complete’ Response Category and complete the 2 new fields when warned they are
needed.

e If the TFSNow and Operational Change Dates are set, and maintained, by the support user then
it will see the normal reporting fields auto updated.

e That should mean that they will not be caught by the MAC WI so as people start to use it, the
chasers from MAC will diminish.

e Reviews and reports on Peaks is consistent with those being deployed under a release.

« When a Peak that is ##LiveAffectingDefect is being assigned to another person, there is a
prompt that appears:

ssc.fs.fujitsu.com says

I cere tis r-assgnmentis made please conf that as manyof the
1 Impact Tab fields as you can complete have been updated. This will help
] us ensure the impact Tab contains an ever improving level of content

Y accuracy.

Cancel

If they click “Ok” then the re-assignment continues as normal. If they click “Cancel” then the re-
assignment is stopped whilst they go make further changes.

e Deferred Peaks (that do not relate to test environment findings) become Live Defects. When a
Peak is deferred, the Fujitsu party obtaining the agreement must ensure the
##LiveAffectingDefect Collection is set where applicable and any applicable HDR-Fin or HDR-
EXP Collection.
