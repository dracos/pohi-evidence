Hi Carol,

The audit took place on the Friday and the transfer to a temp happened on the following Monday, Anjum led the
transfer and I believe that they found a further discrepancy of around £200 which must be the figure you have.

I'm currently supporting on site so I don't have access to any figures to confirm the amount, but Anjum would be able to
shed more light on what the further discrepancy was for.

Sorry I can't be more helpful

Regards Brenda

Brenda, I wonder if you can help me please

tam dealing with this case and trying to sort out the final debt figure . I have been advised by the Former Agent Debt
team there is an amount of £205.61 that has been entered on the account as “final account deficiency “. Do you have
any ideas what that is , was it something that came to light when the office was transferred over to the temp ?

The audit loss I have is £61, 858.40

Thanks

Regards
