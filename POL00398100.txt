4.2 POL Operational Committees/Forums/Meetings

Post Office Operational Committees will be run and managed by Post Office IT Governance & Control.

The following diagram represents the proposed Post Office owned Operational Governance structure.

The IT Relationship Meeting is to be run and managed by Post Office due to restrictions on SISD
involvement in Post Office and Supply Chain Member reviews. An IT Relationship Meeting will be held
with all members of the Supply Chain including the Service Integrator.

Figure 3 - Note: Operational Governance (As at 20/03/14)

The IT Relationship Meetings will act as a two-way method of communication taking outputs of the

other Post Office owned Operational Committees but also providing input into them.

The ITIL Performance & Service Review Committee will act as the first layer of Governance for Post
Office in the management of the Service Integrator’s governance of the Supply Chain looking
specifically at the reporting from the Service Desk and Service Management Centre workstreams. It will

also take inputs from the Governance & Assurance Service for Issue Management.

The ITIL Performance & Service Review Committee will also act as a feed into the IT Service Commercial
Committee along with any monthly Service Reviews with key SCMs conducted by the Service Integrator.
Both the ITIL Performance and Review Committee and the IT Service Commercial Committee will feed

into the Management layer for IT Supplier & Service Committees.
