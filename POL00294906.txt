Subject: Horizon independent assessment

Lesley, excuse me if I missed it - did you get back to me re confirmation as to how robust/reliable Pintest (is that the right
name) were? le what other type of validation work they have done on this scale/ for whom?

Also when do we expect the results?
Kevin has heard today the BBC may be going for more coverage.

Thx Paula
