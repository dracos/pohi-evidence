Investigation Team Post Office Limited

c.c. Lisa Allen

POST OFFICE LIMITED v SUZANNE LESLEY PALMER
CASE NO: POLTD/0506/0619

Noted thank you.

I am of the opinion that there is sufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of
conviction of Miss Palmer for the offences of false accounting.

This case is in my opinion more suitable for trial in the Crown Court in view of the
deficiency in the account of £14,712.11. Once the decision has been made
please proceed to obtain summonses.

No further statements need be obtained at this stage.

If the Defendant should elect trial or if the Magistrates refuse jurisdiction or if a Not
Guilty plea is entered, the Officer should obtain and associate all necessary statements
and exhibits. I list below the statements which appear to be necessary in this case, but
the Officer should also consider whether there are any other areas which can usefully
be covered and include any such evidence.

1 ‘Statement from the Auditors.

2 Statement dealing with Mrs Palmer's appointment at the Office as the
Subpostmistress producing a copy of the relevant extract of Mrs Palmer's
contract showing it is not permitted to use Post Office Limited funds.

3 Statement from Lisa Allen and Chester Chine outlining their total involvement
in the matter and producing the relevant exhibits for the weeks charged

4 Any other statements the Officers consider relevant.

The prosecution will be conducted by my Agents Messrs Sheldons Jenkins, Solicitors
of 815 Southchurch Road, Southend on Sea, Essex SS1 2PP (Tel.No;
!GRO_} Please liaise with Agents before fixing a hearing date.
