Martin, Kevin

further to Jeff’s email, if it were possible for you to facilitate access for Jeff and Dulay to the necessary
documents as a matter of urgency, it would be very greatly appreciated. Lack of timely access to the
documents is significantly affecting the ability of Jeff and Dulay to undertake their study of the Horizon
System.

If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Many thanks,

Paul

Dear Martin and Kevin

We are having a problem with the transfer of documentation to us. This is causing a
severe delay in progress and making it difficult to perform the work.

We are still waiting for the documents which were apparently sent from Fujitsu and
forwarded to Cartwright King in early December!
We have also not received the Second Sight/Mediation documents mentioned by
Andy Holt.

At the last meeting at Fujitsu with James Davidson of Fujitsu in November, it was
agreed that they would try and set up some form of file sharing arrangement so that
access to documentation would be more convenient than a transfer via so many
intermediaries.

Please can you chase this up as a matter of some urgency.

Thanks and best wishes for 2015

Thanks very much, Andy.
No, we have received nothing as yet.

What is happening about setting up the shared file store?
James suggested this and was going to email us all (incl.
Cartright) about this which we strongly support. It would
make things much easier and more efficient. Perhaps you
could chase this up for us, please.

Hi Kevin. Look forward to meeting you in due course.
Keep well

Hi Jeff

I received 3 zip files from Fujitsu yesterday afternoon, I have
forwarded these to Jarnail/Cartwright King.

Have you received the Second Sight/Mediation docs I sent them
earlier in the week?

I have copied Kevin Lenihan so you have his contact details and
so he is aware of any correspondence. Direct anything to me
before the 24" December and I will deal with it.

Regards
Andy
