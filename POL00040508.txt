Belinda
Many thanks — I think we’re broadly there, subject to the point you make about needing a view on prosecutions and
some general tidying up which I am doing now. I note that Rod would like CK to have a look in the morning, but we

should still comfortably meet the 2pm deadline Richard is working to.

l imagine Mark Underwood will have version control under control but I imagine he’s still in the land of nod just now,
and who can blame him I

Richard Callard indicated he’d be working on this this morning, so will get it over to him around about 9 your time and
work on his comments once fam back in London at about 2pm,

Best wishes

Patrick

My comments on Rod and Andy’s so I hope this is OK with version control.

Copying Chris and Mark so they can see where we have got to.

Finance will have to sign off the figures — Mark has this in hand for Monday morning but Chris please note —- may need
some assistance with that.

Andy Parsons, could you and Jarnail please liaise with about getting a definitive position on the prosecution

position. This will need to be done as a matter of urgency

Best wishes

Belinda
