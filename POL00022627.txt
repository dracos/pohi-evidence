Dear Jonathan

Best wishes for the new year. And a slight delay will not cause a problem, I'm sure.

Dear Tim,

Happy new year.

A brief update if I may, on the review report that Chris and I are preparing. We are working on a final
draft, and I expect it will be with you in final form by late Monday/early Tuesday next week. My
apologies for the slight delay (you will recall we had hoped to have the final version to you this
week); I am in court this week and this means that my work on the document has to be in the
evenings, and not during the main part of the day.

Regards,

Jonathan
