I checked the event log on the machine. There were a lot of red events like the one described from 20:17 to 20:53. This is the
time when MSQL on the audit server is down. It looks like someone was trying to run a slow ARQ at this time. This does not work.
mly fast ARQs left running run though the evening shutdown. Slow ARQs fail in somewhat unpredictable ways if tried to be run
hen SQL server is down. I attach the tuneable trace log.

subject: RE: KEL’s for BEAR'S

ti Yannis,

m reflection if you like I could write a very vague KEL saying that these events sometimes occur and have not yet been found to
Ihave any serious effect. That would not take me long.

Itt would be better though, in my opinion, to leave the PEAK open and investigate the matter thoroughly ? the trouble is that
ould take a lot of time.

regards,

KEL's for PEAK'S

li Yannis,

this is on my task list. It has very low priority though and it will take quite a bit of investigation to come up with anything
juseful for the KEL. I can give no forecast as to when this will be done ? as soon as all my more important tasks are done I will
icok at it very carefully.

Regards,
lserald Barnes

[Start of Response]

the error handling does not identify closely enough what is causing this red event. It needs a release with improved error
handling. However the Prosecution Team have not complained to me of any issues. Were they to show how the problem occurred I

could identify it that way.
