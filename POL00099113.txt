All
This is how I propose to go back to Janet:

Second para, final sentence: could it end at “devastated”? There is a clarity question here — which investigators
do we mean, our Past Office people or SS?

- Could the third bullet change to “training and support processes which have been found to be inadequate in
some cases”

- Final bullet: we don’t accept that there is an unresolved question here — we provided evidence to SS — there is
also a Fujitsu angle. We would have to respond to this particular statement
Susan to come back to me on the sentence about ‘criminal and civil liabilities’

Hi Janet

Just to update you, Matt Prodger of the BBC has called us asking for our statement, which of course we won’t provide
until we have had any feedback from you.

He appears to have lined up a subpostmaster interview which he says may appear on the 6pm news.

Mark
