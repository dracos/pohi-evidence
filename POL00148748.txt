As a follow up to my email this morning I would suggest a meeting next week to progress this. I have spoken the
others on the email so they are aware. My main aim is that this is not to be held up whilst I am away.

Attendees should be
- Fujitsu - James Davidson will organise
-  IT-Julie George
- Legal — you and Jarnail (Rod if required)

Agenda should cover
POL00148748
POL00148748

- The business requirement and outcome needed (Jarnail)
- Scope of this work (All)
© agree how we steer this or define the requirement correctly so the scope doesn’t get out of control and
we allow Imperial College to produce independent report
o Is this a full system wide review or verification that audit data correctly reflects counter actions (or
something in between)
o What has been covered by other work/audits
- Learning and any decisions from Deloitte work that impacts the above (Chris/Julie)
- Scale of work required, current understand of parties involved, likelihood/risks in achieving outcomes (All)
- Approach and next steps (ALL)

Regards
Andy

Chris
Have you got time for a quick conversation on this today. Having met with Cartwright King yesterday I wanted to
discuss

- Scope of work

- Outcomes & learning from Deloitte work

- Approach & next steps
If you can’t make a call today I will speak to Julie George and James Davidson (Fujitsu) to arrange a meeting next
week. I am away on annual leave for the next couple of weeks and want to make sure there are steps in place to
progress this activity.

Regards

Andy
