Dear Mr McCormack,
Request under the Freedom of Information Act —- FOI2021/00093

Further to my letter dated 25 March 2021, I refer to your request for information
under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), as set out below:

“Good to see the new spirit of openness in action yet again this morning with the
publication of redacted copies of Board Minutes.

Could you therefore please provide me with copies of all Board Minutes in which is
mentioned the Clarke Advice or Clarke Review. The contents of which I suspect you
may wish to redact but I am most interested in the attendees of those meetings and
the dates of the meetings.”

Thank you for also clarifying on 28 February 2021 that:
1. by “Clarke Advice or Clarke Review”, you were referring to the Simon
Clarke advice dated 15 July 2013; and
2. your request is for the relevant sections of minutes at which the Simon
Clarke advice dated 15 July 2013 was mentioned, as well as the dates and
board members present at those meetings.

Post Office Limited ("Post Office”) has conducted reasonable and proportionate
searches and has identified two sets of board minutes in which the Simon Clarke
advice dated 15 July 2013 was mentioned: the minutes of a meeting on 19
November 2020 and the minutes of a meeting on 04 February 2021. The same board
members were present at both board meetings. These were:

« Tim Parker
Ken McCall
Tom Cooper
Carla Stent
Zarin Patel
Lisa Harrington
Alisdair Cameron
Nick Read

The relevant sections of those board minutes in which the Simon Clarke advice dated
15 July 2013 was mentioned have been withheld, as Post Office considers the
information is exempt from disclosure as information which is subject to legal
professional privilege under section 42 FOIA. Since section 42 is a qualified
exemption, the public interest test has also been considered. Post Office is satisfied
that the public interest in maintaining the exemption by withholding the privileged
information outweighs the public interest in disclosing it. In reaching this conclusion
Post Office has considered all the circumstances of this matter, including the context,
the number of people potentially affected by the issues, the strength of opinion these
issues have given rise to and the public interest in openness and transparency.

Against these factors Post Office notes in particular the strong inherent public
interest in preserving legal privilege which it considers, in all the circumstances,
outweighs the public interest in disclosure.

If you have any queries about this response, please contact me. Do remember to
quote the reference number above in any future communications.

I hope the information I have provided on this occasion is useful, however if you are
dissatisfied with the handling of this response, you do have a right to request an
internal review. You can do this by writing to the address below stating your reasons
for your internal review request.
