OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE
Hi Sam,

With thanks to those on copy, please find Ministerial advice seeking agreement to continue with
offering the £75,000 fixed sum payment to postmasters in the Horizon Shortfall Scheme, without
offering the £50,000 interim payment to postmasters who wish to have their full claim assessed (as
previously agreed with the Minister). The advice sets out the reasoning why.

Lead private secretary: Sam Griffiths
Submission title: FOR DECISION: HSS Fixed Sum Interim Payments

Timing: Urgent. We would be grateful for a quick read-out as this is one of the issues that needs
to be resolved prior to implementation of the fixed sum awards to new claims.

Summary: Due to implementation challenges, officials have reconsidered the policy of offering
£50k interim payments to postmasters unwilling to accept the £75k fixed sum on HSS and are
seeking your approval to continue without this offer. We need to reach a position quickly in order
to enable offers to issue to newer HSS claimants.

Recommendation: We recommend that the Minister agrees not to offer £50k interim payments to
HSS claimants who do not wish to accept the fixed sum award.

Cleared by: Carl Creswell, Post Office and Business Engagement Director
