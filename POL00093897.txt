Continuation of statement of Deborah Alison EDWARDS

In order to carry out this verification I would print off a command 2 and a command 3
printout from the Forde Moneychanger equipment. I did this at 0811 hours and
produce the printout as item number DAE/01. I should point out that the printout
indicates 0911 hours, however, the clock on the machine had not been adjusted and

therefore was one hour ahead.

The command 2 printout indicates all of the Foreign currency on hand together with the
travellers cheques, it lists each foreign currency type, the number of notes and travellers
cheques and the sterling value of the notes for that currency. At the bottom of this
printout it gives a total sterling value of all of the various currencies held and in this

case that figure was £ 21,263.79.

The command 3 printout provides a summary of the transactions which have taken
place that week such as a total sterling value of Buy Notes (BN), Sell Notes (SN) and
Balance. The printout then also lists each of the currencies and shows how much was

bought and sold.

It can be seen that at the time of this printout the Forde Moneychanger was indicating
that there had been 21 transactions where notes had been bought (BN) to a sterling
value of £ 5,594.24 and that there had been 44 transactions where notes had been sold to
the sterling value of £ 371,082.58. The Balance is shown as a sterling value of

£ 21,263.79 which matches the total on the command 2 summary and should be the

sterling value of foreign currency held in the Bureau till.

I then commenced physically counting each of the currencies within the Bureau till and

wrote down the figures I found on a piece of paper which I now produce as item
number DAEF/02. It can be seen that some of the figures agreed with the command 2
printout and others did not and I have indicated on DAE/02 the differences. There

wasn’t any huge discrepancies, just the odd amount here or there.

There were some other foreign currency amounts which I needed to transfer into the
Forde Moneychanger in order to obtain a final balance which I did at 11:51 hours (12:51
as indicated on the printout), I produce this printout as item number DAE/03. I then
printed off a new command 2 and command 3 printout, which I now produce as item
number DAE/04 which indicates the amendments made and shows a total sterling
value of £ 21,642.20 which is the sterling value of the foreign currency held in the
Bureau till at that time. The command 3 printout shows the balance in sterling of

£ 21,642.20

During the course of the audit, I was made aware of the fact that the ‘AM’ stock unit
had indicated that it held £ 282,000.00 worth of Foreign currency which could not be
located and therefore to keeps things tidy as it was indicated as foreign currency it was
decided that it should be transferred from the ‘AM’ stock unit to the Bureau (BU) stock
unit which I did at 12:21 hours as indicated by the printout produced by the Horizon
computer system which I now produce as item number DAE/05. I also noted the
transfer of this amount on the ‘AM’ stock unit balance snapshot (item KO/01) and it is
my handwriting which appears on this printout indicating Foreign currency

“Transferred to BU”.

I then produced a command 10 (weekly summary) printout from the Forde

Moneychanger, I now produce this printout as item number DAE/06. This printout

shows the total cash held value of £ 22,938.72 and it is this figure which is input into the
Horizon system, the figure is made up of the figure of £ 21,642.20 which is the foreign
currency sterling value held and a revalue figure of £ 1,296.52. The revaluation figure is

as a result of the fluctuating exchange rates over the course of the week.

I then verified the cash (sterling) held within the bureau till by counting what was
physically held in the till and noting down the different denominations on a form called
a Network Audit - Cash Summary and then entering these amounts into the Horizon
system to produce a ‘Declared Cash’ Horizon printout, I now produce both as item
number DAE/07. It can be seen that the amount of sterling on hand in the Bureau till

that morning was £ 11,373.01.

With the above two figures of Foreign currency held £ 22,938.72 and the cash sterling
held £ 11,373.01 together with any further stock items, you get the ‘TOTAL STOCK &
MOP’ figure which in this case was £ 34,491.73.

In order to then obtain a final balance for the Bureau stock unit, you are required to
feed into the horizon system all of the figures relating to ‘RECEIPTS’ which is anything
which has been paid into that till, for instance Remittance items (REM) received from
Hemel Hempstead, etc including in this instance the figure of £ 287,000.00 as a transfer
in, £ 282,000.00 of that having been transferred in from ‘AM’ stock unit. Also all of the
figures in relation to ‘PAYMENTS’ must also be input into the Horizon system and this
would include any amounts such as Remittances out etc. In this particular instance I
was given a figure by Mr Burrows of £ 642,258.79 to input into the payments sections
and I believe this figure related to the value of several cheques which had been

removed from the Bureau till by the Police on the previous evening.

Having input all of the required figures into Horizon, I was able to balance this stock
unit, however the figure of £ 642,258.79 made up part of the final office shortage, I
produce the final Balance for BU stock unit as item number DAE/08.
