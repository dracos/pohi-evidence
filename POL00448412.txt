Please can you produce a suitable response for Henry.

You will be aware of my views from discussions we have had....
I assume there are GFA restrictions too ?

For this afternoon please.

Nick ,

Could you please organise a response after our Board tomorrow ? At least one NED has said I should meet them but
I think that would be a mistake . We do need something to say to them in our reply however . Many thanks .

Best,

Henry

Di,

Please print out VOP attachments .

I work flexibly — so whilst it suits me to email outside of normal working hours, I do not expect a response during that
time.

Hello Henry,

This is the suggested email to send to Board (excluding Lorna and Nick), hopefully, I have interpreted all of
your emails correctly — happy to discuss in the morning. I have a doctors appointment at 08.45hrs but
should be back home by 09.15hrs.

Dear all

Ahead of our call on Thursday, please see attached a copy of the Voice of the Postmaster Press Release
for January, together with the letter addressed to myself.

In addition, please see attached a file note I prepared following my conversation with Saf and Elliot on
Sunday — §00BG. They were very supportive of
Nick, but you will see that the VOP have made negative statements about Nick .

Let's talk about this on Thursday and to note I have not yet responded to VoP regarding their request for a
meeting.

Regards,
Henry

PS Saf reminded me that I had omitted to mention the following : ...........

¢ I have offered the investigations team time to get the tone right and advised them to get more PM’s
involved but this seems to have been missed.

* The comms has been poor throughout our tenure within the business.

* The GE have overlooked advice given to them by board members on several occasions without
clear explanations.

Hi Henry
This echoes very much the comments that we discussed on Sunday - clearly we are not losing the
plot and real action is essential.
