Subject: Fwd: Meeting with Paula Vennells 26.02.19

This is worth a read - Sam’s take on what the minister wants for her meeting with Paula on Tuesday.
Pll lead on the briefing - and may come to you all for some material.

Separately we have been commissioned for an update note for the Perm Sec for his meeting with Tim Parker on

5 March. Hopefully lots of the ministers note can be repurposed

Hi Tom,

The Minister came back on the submission for Paula’s package and commented that she’d like an update
on the timeline for the departure and thought it would be useful to meet before she leaves. She still
feels there are a lot of risks around POL activity.

In terms of briefing, I’d suggest you clearly set out the various ongoing pieces of work and where they
are up to — Paula’s departure announcement, the interim CEO, the recruitment process, the litigation
case etc. She has seen various bits separately and would find it useful to have the summary in one
place.

I would suggest you don’t chase her on clearance of the interim CEO in the briefing as the Minister is
already aware. Also just to note that she is disappointed that we don’t yet have a clear path for the
recruitment of the new CEO, so would suggest outlining this in as much detail as possible. She may well
question you on this before/after the meeting.

Hope that helps.
Sam

Sam

Do you know why Kelly asked to meet Paula and what she wants out of the meeting?

I want to make sure we’re providing briefing that’s useful to her, so it would be very helpful to get your
advice on what, if anything, she’d like material on.

Tom C’s not available so I’m intending to attend
Grateful for any advice
