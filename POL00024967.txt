Jane

Thanks. I am fine with the note to the board. Any elaboration on our media line should not include a phrase such as
‘conspiracy theories’ as this sounds emotive. Could we change 'considered and resolved' to 'considered and disproved'?

On way up to Bradford to day so limited access - call me if urgent.

Cheers

Tom

Given the conversation at GE on Monday (which Mike G was at}, I wonder whether we should have an
additional line which we could consider using if the remote access issue comes up? This would be along
the line of:

POL-0021446
POL00024967
POL00024967

“We are aware of a claim and we are defending our position through the legal processes. We welcome
the opportunity for these allegations to be considered and resolved through the Court process.” ( Al’s
suggestion went further and referred to conspiracy theories ...}

in relation to the Board (and GE), I would like to send a note out today along the lines set out below —
any thoughts ?

Many thanks,
Jane

Draft note for the Board
Subject: Postmaster Litigation

As you will recall from the briefing provided at the May board, although formal proceedings have still
not been served on Post Office (although we expect these by 11 August), we have been in discussion
with Freeths (the solicitors acting for the claimants) on a range of issues and we were advised yesterday
that the number of claimants has now increased to 198; again this was not unexpected.

As mentioned in my May briefing, on 28 April Freeths had sent to us a lengthy Letter of Claim. Bond
Dickinson (on our behalf) responded to this last night. The response letter (which runs to 99 pages)
provides a detailed rebuttal to each and every issue raised in the Letter of Claim, and was discussed at
length within Post Office and has been reviewed by our QC Tony Robinson.

While none of the allegations set out in the Letter of Claim are new, and we are not relying on any new
information in our rebuttal, the tone of our response is more assertive than we have used previously,
given that our rebuttal arguments will help to shape the issues that will form the basis of any

litigation. Although the rebuttal is a legal letter between the two firms of solicitors, we fully expect that
it will be made available to the claimants and therefore we should assume that its contents will become
public, and it has been written with this risk in mind.

Should we become aware of any planned media coverage, we will let you know, however our
communications approach will continue to be the Postmasters have sought to resolve the matter
through litigation and that is the appropriate forum through which the issues in the case should be
resolved. Therefore we do not plan to make any external comment beyond “we are aware of a claim
and are defending our position through the legal processes”. To do otherwise will only serve to provoke
further coverage.

In addition we have a range of reactive messaging ready to go to staff and postmasters; we have
briefings ready to use for relevant managers, and will direct postmasters and staff to our established
support procedures in the event of any concerns. We are also updating BIS on the risk of adverse
coverage.

Please call me if you would like any further information.

Etc”
