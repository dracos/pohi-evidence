From Graham Brander
Investigator Date 15/01/07

Further to your advice I have now prepared committal papers, in respect
of the prosecution against Mrs Josephine Hamilton.

The attached committal papers comprise of the following:

e One bundle of typed witness statements with form CS009

e One bundle of copy exhibits with form CS012

e Forms CSOO6C, D and E (unused schedules and Disclosure
officers report

e Form CS033 Antecedents x 7

Please note that I am still waiting for two original statements to arrive in
the post (copies are included as part of this bundle). As such I will bring
all the original statements to the committal hearing.

I have included copies of items 4 and 5 listed on the CSOO6C (Schedule
of Non-Sensitive Unused Material). Item 4 relates to a reference given to
Mrs Hamilton by the previous Postmaster as part of her seeking to take
on South Warnborough SPOB. It is quite complimentary as to her alleged
ability at running the Post Office.

Item 5 relates to notes taken at the pre-appointment interview and
suggests that Mrs Hamilton is selling herself as more than capable, with
the only negative evidence being her preference to a manual system and
only uses computers because she has to.

Please advise me if you require any further information at this stage
