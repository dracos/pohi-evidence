Subject: Branch Standards and Financial Consequences for Franchisees.

Introduction and Purpose

The Branch Standards booklet and supporting contract amendment were communicated to
subpostmasters on the 5" March 2010. The purpose of this document is to outline the
approach that will be taken with individuals and companies who operate their branch or
branches under an Independent Franchise Agreement (IFPO) or Company Franchise
Agreement (CFPO),

Background

All of the Branch Standards and consequences outlined in ACC 05/ 2010 apply to
franchisees. However, they will receive different communications as they should not be
addressed as subpostmasters and their contractual obligations are different. The financial
consequences are being introduced as an addition to the Franchise Manual and not to the
Franchise Agreement.

Scope
The communications will be received by and will apply to all franchisees, with the exception
of WH Smith.

Process

All franchise branches will receive the Branch Standards booklet, which is designed to act
as a reminder of instructions that have been previously communicated. This is not a
replacement for existing operating procedures.

The following covering letter and the addition to the Franchise Manual will be received by all
franchisees including Multiple Partners.
