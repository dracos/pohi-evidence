SECTION 3

COMMUNITY SUBPOSTMASTERS’ ABSENCE FROM OFFICE

GENERAL

1.

Under the terms of his contract, the Community Subpostmaster is not obliged to render personal
services and is therefore free to absent himself from the office, provided he makes suitable
arrangements for the conduct of the office during his absence.

He should notify the Regional General Manager on form P2593 when he will be away for any period
exceeding seven consecutive days.

The Community Subpostmaster’s responsibility for the proper conduct of his office, or for any losses
occurring during his absence, is in no way diminished by his absence from the Sub-Office. He must
make proper provision, at his own expense, for the conduct of his office while he is away, but
assistance towards the cost of his own substitution may be provided in respect of certain absences, if
he normally renders personal services.

ABSENCE ON HOLIDAY

4.

The Community Subpostmaster is not entitled to annual leave as such, but those who normally render
personal services may be able to claim reimbursement of the necessary cost of substitution when
taking a holiday. This reimbursement of the actual costs of the substitution is paid as a Holiday
Substitution Allowance, and is the net additional cost necessarily incurred by the Community
Subpostmaster in providing during his own absence Post Office Counters Ltd duties which he
normally performs personally. The amount of reimbursement, which will be restricted to the standard
hours on which service is normally provided, will be subject to a limit of one and a half times the
Community Subpostmaster’s payment for the period for which the substitution was performed,
including employees Class 1 National Insurance Contribution.

The Community Subpostmaster with less than 10 years service may claim Holiday Substitution
Allowance in respect of the number of standard hours that he would normally provide during 7
weeks in a period of 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year. This allowance will be increased
to the number of standard hours that he would normally provide during 8 weeks in a period of 24
months beginning 1 April in every odd year for a Community Subpostmaster with 10 years service or
more.

The Community Subpostmaster must do his best to find his own substitute and make all necessary
arrangements for his own absence, which should be notified to the Regional General Manger on form
P2593. In cases of difficulty the Regional General Manager or the secretary of the local branch of the
National Federation of Sub-postmaster may be able to give him the names and ad dresses of local
people known to be willing to offer their services as holiday reliefs to Subpostmasters. Responsibility
for concluding agreement with such people remains with the Community Subpostmaster concerned.

Issue
September 1994

NFSP00000760
NFSP00000760

7. Formal claims for Holiday Substitution Allowance should be made on forms P2340 and P2340(a)
which must be submitted to the Regional General Manager within three months of the end of the
period of substitution to which the claim relates. The Subpostmaster must certify:-

(a) that he has taken a holiday from both the Sub-Office and from any associated private business
during the whole period covered by the claim;

(b) _ that if the Subpostmaster holds more than one appointment he was absent from all his Sub-
Offices at the same time;

(c) _ that, in respect of the services he provides as Community Subpostmaster, he has actually and
necessarily incurred additional expenditure equating to the amount claimed, in respect of a paid
substitute or substitutes with the exception of members of his family who normally, rather than
occasionally, participate in this work.

8. Where the Community Subpostmaster is also an employee of the Post Office either on a full or part-
time basis, e.g.. Allowance Deliverer, it is essential, in view of the terms of the certificate required as a
condition of refundment of the cost of his substitution as Community Subpostmaster, that during any
period of holiday as Community Subpostmaster he should be absent from all other Post Office work.

ABSENCE DURING SICKNESS

9. Subject to certain conditions and limitations descried in sub-paragraph 10. hereof, he is entitled to
claim Sick Absence Substitution Allowance in respect of the cost of substitution necessarily incurred
when he is absent from his Sub-Office through illness.

10. With the exception of women over 65 and men over 70 years of age, all Community Subpostmasters
who are absent from their Sub-Offices through illness, are eligible to claim Sick Absence Substitution
Allowance in respect of each appointment where personal services are normally rendered. For the
purposes of this scheme a week is defined as the number of standard hours on which service is liable
to be provided in any consecutive period of 7 days. The allowance is payable subject to, and in
accordance with, the following conditions:

(a) _ the allowance will be payable when the period of any continuous sick absence amounts to three
calendar weeks or more and it will be paid retrospectively for all but the first week of absence;

(b) payment of the allowance will be limited to an aggregate period of 13 calendar weeks in any
consecutive period of 12 months;

(c) however, where a Community Subpostmaster is incapacitated by an accident or illness which
results, or is likely to result, in a continuous absence beyond 13 weeks, Regional General
Managers may authorise payment of the allowance to be extended up to a maximum period of
26 weeks in any one period of 12 months. Where a Community Subpostmaster has already
received up to 12 weeks of the Sick Absence Substitution Allowance entitlement in the previous
12 months he may, because of an extended illness be authorised by the Regional General
Manager to receiver the allowance up to a maximum of 26 weeks in total of any one period of 12
months. Any extension allowed under this paragraph must be in respect of one continuous
period of sick absence. In no circumstances will more than one such extension be allowed in
any one period of 12 months.

NFSP00000760
NFSP00000760

(4) where Community Subpostmaster’s period of reimbursement of sick absence substitution costs
is extended beyond the 13 calendar continuous weeks, such an extension will be reviewed
periodically; under no circumstances will the Community Subpostmaster be allowed to
aggregate separate periods of sick absence beyond 13 weeks in any one period of 12 months.

(c) the maximum allowance payable will be the total amount calculated by applying the
Community Subpostmaster’s appropriate Holiday Substitution Allowance rate for the period
for which Sick Absence Substitution Allowance is payable, or the actual additional costs of
substitution incurred for the same period, whichever is the lesser.

() the maximum amount of the allowance for the period of absence for which an allowance is
payable will be abated, where applicable, by the statutory national insurance sickness benefit or
maternity allowance for the same period. Where however, a Community Subpostmistress
receives a NH Maternity Grant, the substitution allowance should not be reduced by the
amount of that grant. (Note: statutory national insurance sickness benefit means that benefit
which is payable to a person otherwise than in respect of another person who is a child or an
adult dependent.) Where a Community Subpostmaster is not eligible for DSS benefits, a
medical certificate should accompany the claim for payment of the substitution allowance.

Any Community Subpostmaster who qualifies for the Sick Absence Substitution Allowance, and can
produce evidence to show that substitution costs were incurred, should submit a claim to the Regional
General Manager after he has been absent for 3 calendar weeks. Thereafter he should claim the
allowance at the end of each subsequent period of absence of 4 weeks (or at the end of the period of
absence if that is reached earlier). Claim forms (P3485) will be supplied by the Regional General
Manager on request.

Where an eligible Community Subpostmaster as defined above is absent sick for a period of less than
3 weeks, and does not qualify for payment of the Sick Absence Substitution Allowance, he will be free
to claim, in respect of any substitute for him, Holiday Substitution Allowance for the period of.
absence up to the limit of any outstanding balances of his HSA entitlement. Forms P2340 and P2340(a)
should be used by Community Subpostmasters when making these claims . The amounts payable will
not be subject to abatement of any national insurance sickness benefit received. Any period of sick
absence for which HSA (as distinct from Sick Absence Substitution Allowance) is paid will count
against the HSA entitlement.

ABSENCE FOR JURY SERVICE

13.

A Community Subpostmaster who receives a summons to serve on a jury should notify his Regional
General Manager immediately, and inform him of the arrangements which he proposes to make for
the conduct of the work of the Sub-Office in his absence. Where exceptionally the Community
Subpostmaster is unable to find a substitute and the Sub-Office is temporarily closed on account of the
absence of the Community Subpostmaster on jury service, payment to the Community Subpostmaster
for the period of closure will be withheld. Community Subpostmasters attending for jury service
should claim from the court any allowances for which they are eligible in respect of travelling and
subsistence and, where appropriate, compensation for loss of remuneration. Ifa Community
Subpostmaster is in need of advice as to the allowances to which he is entitled, he should seck it from
the official responsible for the issue of the summons.

SECTION 4

STATUTORY SICK PAY SCHEME

INTRODUCTION

1. Under the terms of the Social Security{ XE "Social Security" }and Housing Benefit{XE "Housing
Benefit" }s Act 1982 employers are responsible for statutory sick pay arrangements in respect of their
employees. An employee is interpreted as including office holders who receive emoluments liable for
income tax{XE "income tax" } under Schedule E. Subpostmasters come within this category and
consequently Post Office Counters Ltd is obliged to comply with the conditions of the Act.

2. The use of the words “employee” and “employer” are used in the context of this particular piece of
legislation and do not in any way alter the Subpostmaster’s status {XE "Subpostmaster’s status" } as an
independent contractor.

GENERAL

8. Under the terms of the Scheme most Subpostmasters will not get State sickness benefit {XE "sickness
benefit" } for their first twenty eight weeks of sickness in each tax year. Instead they will get Statutory
sick pay{ XE "Statutory sick pay" }, known as SSP, from Post Office Counters Ltd. SSP is paid at a flat
rate. There are 2 weekly rates and eligibility depends on an employee's average earnings over a
specified period. There are no allowances for dependants. SSP is taxable and subject to NI
contributions.

{XE "Allowances:Statutory Sick Pay" }

EXCLUSIONS
4. A Subpostmaster will not get statutory sick pay if he comes within one of the following groups. Ifa

Subpostmaster falls within one of these groups he should still notify his Regional General Manager

about his sickness.

A Subpostmaster reaches the end of his entitlement to SSP from Post Office Counters Ltd when:

(a) I Subpostmasters who already had twenty eight weeks of SSP from Post Office Counters Ltd ina
tax year in any one period of incapacity {XE "period of incapacity " }for work (referred to as
PIW)(linked or unlinked):

(b) _ his linked PIW with Post Office Counters Ltd has run for 3 years.

(c) _ she is pregnant and reaches the ‘disqualifying period’.

(d) his contract for service ends;

{XE "Contract:Statutory Sick Pay" }

(c)  Subpostmasters who fall sick in a country outside the EEC.

() he is no longer incapable of work, icc. he returns to work or stops sending certificates of
incapacity.

QUALIFYING CONDITIONS

5. Statutory Sick Pay can only be paid for qualifying days. It has been agreed with the National
Federation of Sub-Postmasters that qualifying days for Subpostmasters will be those days they are
normally required to provide the services detailed in Section I of this contract. Where Subpostmasters
are required to give services for only part of the day, that day will count in full for statutory sick pay
purposes. For the majority of Subpostmasters there will be six qualifying days in each week (Monday
to Saturday). ifa Subpostmaster is in doubt about which days are regarded as qualifying days he
should seck confirmation from his Regional General Manager.

{XE "National Federation of Sub-Postmasters:Statutory Sick Pay" }

6. The entitlement ofa Subpostmaster to SSP. rests on 6 qualifying conditions, all of which must be
fulfilled.
(a) The Subpostmaster must have notified his Regional General Manager {XE "Regional General

(b) Days sickness must be days of incapacity;
(c) The Subpostmaster must provide evidence of incapacity.
(d) Period of incapacity for work (PIW) must be formed and PIW consist of 4 or more consecutive

days, including Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays, when a Subpostmaster is
incapacitated for work. It is immaterial for this purpose whether or not the Subpostmaster
would normally have worked on those days. PIW’s which are separated by 8 weeks (56
calendar days) or less are linked and count together as a single PIW.

(c) When a Subpostmaster falls into one or more of the categories listed below he will be
excluded from receiving SSP. A Subpostmaster who has been excluded cannot return to
SSP entitlement during the course of a PIW, nor at the start of a PIW which links with a
previous one during which he was excluded even though he ceases to be a member of an
excluded group.

(i) Over State pension age

A Subpostmaster who is over State pension age {XE "State pension age " }(65 for a man,
60 for a woman) is excluded from SSP. However, if when a Subpostmaster reaches State
pension age he has a PIW which links with a previous one, he will be entitled to SSP for as
long as his PIW’s continue to link.

(ii) Short contract workers{XE "Short contract workers" }

A Subpostmaster whose contract of employment is for a specified period of 3 calendar
months or less is excluded from SSP. However, if the contract does not at first exceed 3
months, but a Subpostmaster works past the time stated in the contract so that the total
period worked becomes more than 3 calendar months the employee becomes entitled to
SSP as soon as it is known that the total period will be more than 3 calendar months.

{XE "Contract:Short Contract Workers" }

(ii) Low average earnings

A Subpostmaster whose average earnings are less than the lower earnings limit for NI
contribution liability is not entitled to SSP. When one PIW links with a previous one, the
first day in the earlier PIW is used for calculating an employee’s average earnings.

SSP under that contract. Ifhe is a new employee and he reports sick before he takes up
duty, he is not entitled to SSP. However, if he reports for work on his first day of service,
but goes sick on the second, he is entitled to SSP if he fulfils the other qualifying
conditions.

sickness irrespective of whether he is entitled to statutory sick pay.

8. Subpostmasters, including those nominated by limited companies, who hold more than one
appointment, must notify the appropriate Regional General Manager who is responsible for the
collection of primary National Insurance contributions in respect of his appointments. (See section 6,
paragraph 1)

9. Ifa Subpostmaster is late in giving notification of sickness, he should advise the Regional General
Manager of the reason for the delay. If the Regional General Manager is not satisfied with the reason
given for the delay, any period of sickness prior to the date of notification will not count for the
purposes of statutory sick pay. Ifa Subpostmaster is not satisfied with the Regional General
Manager’s decision on this matter he may apply to the Department of Social Security for a ruling. Ifa

the Subpostmaster will continue to attract income tax and National Insurance contributions in full.

SECTION 6
NATIONAL INSURANCE
CLASSIFICATIONS
da For national insurance {XE "national insurance " }purposes, a Subpostmaster is regarded as an office

holder with emoluments chargeable to income tax {XE "income tax " Junder schedule E. As such, all
Subpostmasters are liable to make national insurance contributions in accordance with the pro
of Class 1.

Class 1 contributions comprise 2 parts:-
(a) the Primary contribution which is generally known as the employce’s contribution

(b) the Secondary contribution which is generally known as the employer’s contribution.

PERSONS TAKING UP APPOINTMENT AS A COMMUNITY SUBPOSTMASTER

2. All persons taking up an appointment as a Subpostmaster should supply the Regional General
Manager {XE "Regional General Manager " }with their national insurance number by means of a NI
number card, form P45 {XE "form P45" Jand/ or P60 (sce leaflet NI217{ XE "leaflet NI217" }) and also
any current certificate of Earner’s non/ reduced rate liability that they have. Where for one reason or
another a new Subpostmaster does not supply a NI, number the action outlined in the Employer’s
Guide to National Insurance Contributions (NP 15) will be followed.

CONTRACTING OUT

{XE "Contracting Out of SERPS" }

3. Under the Social Security Act 1975{XE "Social Security Act 1975" }, pensions for retirement,
widowhood and invalidity consist of 2 parts:

(a) _ basic pension;

(b) and additional pension related to an employee’s reckonable earnings between the lower earnings limit
and the upper earnings limit.

4, An employer may contract his employees out of that part of the State Scheme which provides an
additional pension if the Occupational Pensions Board {XE "Occupational Pensions Board " }is
satisfied that his occupational pensions scheme meets the conditions required by the Act. As
Subpostmasters are not employees of Post Office Counters Ltd they are ineligible to belong to the Post
Office Staff Superannuation Scheme {XE "Post Office Staff Superannuation Scheme " Jand therefore
are not contracted out of the State Scheme.

DSS leaflet NP15 {XE "leaflet NP15" }“Employer’s Guide to National Insurance Contributions” gives

(b) asamarried woman her marriage ends in divorce or annulment;

(c) she becomes a widow and after the initial period becomes entitled to widow’s benefit { XE
"widow’s benefit" };

I contribution nor was self-employed.

DSS will provide a certificate authorising deductions ofa Class 1 contributor’s contribution at the
reduced rate. As Post Office Counters Ltd will be held responsible for any deficiencies in
contribution, deductions will be made at the standard rate unless the Subpostmistress produces a
valid certificate.

{XE "REDUCED RATE NI CONTRIBUTIONS"}
NON LIABLE SUBPOSTMASTERS

8.

woman) his/ her deductions may be ceased even though a certificate of age exception has not been
produced.

Subpostmaster’s rate of contribution or even where he is non-liable.

ARREARS OF REMUNERATION

10.

ll.

Arrears of remuneration {XE "Arrears of remuneration " }resulting from a revision or other payments
made to adjust remuneration paid in an earlier month, will be treated as part of the total remuneration
in the month in which the payment is made, regardless of the period for which they are proper to.

SECTION 9

PREMISES

GENERAL

1. The Community Subpostmaster must, at his own expense, provide premises in which such reasonable

office accommodation and fittings as Post Office Counters Ltd may require are made available for
carrying on Post Office Counter Ltd business. Normally, these premises will be owned by the
Community Subpostmaster or his spouse, or will be leased to him or his spouse on a tenancy.
However, in certain instances, the Regional General Manager may authorise the establishment of a
Community Sub-Office in premises which would normally not be acceptable in the case of a full-time
Sub-Office, such as domestic premises, church hall, Community centre ete., in which case the Regional
General Manger may agree, on request, to bear the reasonable one-off cost of adapting such premises
to make them suitable for the running of a Community Sub-Office.

2. The Community Subpostmaster must, at his own expense, ensure that the Sub -Office part of the
premises is kept clean and maintained to a good standard, and provided with adequate lighting and
heating. He may also be required to provide space for posting facilities.

3. The Regional General Manager will decide on the security precautions to be taken at each Community
Sub-Office, taking into account likely levels of cash holdings and possible risks in view of local
circumstances. The Community Subpostmaster may therefore be required to provide facilities for the
installation of such security equipment as the Regional General Manager considers necessary.

4. The Community Subpostmaster must not, without the prior agreement of the Regional General

any failure, on the part of his Assistants, to apply Post Office rules, or to provide a proper standard of
service to the public. He will also be required to make good any deficiency, of cash or stock, which
may result from his assistants’ actions.

{XE "Assistants:Status" }

ASSISTANTS CONDITIONS OF SERVICE

{XE "Assistants:Conditions of Service" }

3. Wages, hours, holidays etc., are a matter to be settled between Subpostmaster and the assistants
concerned. However, they should be no less favourable than those enjoyed by shop assistants
generally in the same region. Post Office Counters Ltd reserves the right to intervene if such
conditions are considered inequitable.

4, The Subpostmaster is responsible, as employer of his assistants, for complying with the provisions of
any legislation which imposes obligations on employers.
{XE "Assistants:Legal Obligations" }

AGE

5. Asa general guide no person under 16 years of age should be employed on Sub-Office work, or have

{XE "Assistants:Age Limit" }

SUITABILITY OF APPLICANT - REFERENCES

6. Inthe light of the Subpostmaster’s responsibilities, set out in paragraph 2 above, he is strongly
recommended to satisfy himself of the character and suitability of an applicant for employment as an
assistant before a firm offer of employment is made. Generally the Subpostmaster should:-

{XE "Assistants:Recruitment" }

(a) _ obtain proof of the identity of the applicant, e.g. birth or marriage certificate, unless the
applicant is known;

(b) seek information from the applicant about any conviction or finding of guilt for any offence in a
Court of Law (including Juvenile Court or Court Martial). In this connection the Subpostmaster
should be aware of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 {XE "Rehabilitation of Offenders
Act 1974" jwhich restricts the information that needs be given;

(c) enquire whether the applicant has ever been employed by the Post Office, worked for another
Subpostmaster or held Sub-Office appointment. If the former then details of such employment
should be entered on form P250 {XE "form P250 "(see paragraph 8) and a reference awaited
from the Regional General Manager. If previously the applicant has worked at another Sub-Post
Office, including as a Subpostmaster, details should be given on form P250 and a reference in

the last employer where the applicant has been employed during the whole of that period.

7. When seeking references the Subpostmaster is advised to enquire if the applicant had found to be
completely trustworthy and ask the reason for his leaving that employment. In some instances a
Subpostmaster might have to employ an assistant before the procedures suggested above are
completed. Bearing in mind the complexities of current employment legislation a Subpostmaster in
such a situation is recommended to offer initially only short term employment pending receipt of
satisfactory references etc.

8. The Subpostmaster must notify the Regional General Manager {XE "Regional General Manager " jof
his intention to employ a new Assistant on Post Office Counters Ltd work or when an assistant ceases
to be employed in the Sub-Office.

{XE "Assistants:Personal Declaration" }

advised to preserve it carefully.

accepted but a receipt must be given showing that the money is held pending possible investigation

comment upon matters affecting the Post Office to exercise those right in a responsible manner.

(c) a Subpostmaster offering unauthorised public comment must make it clear that he is

commenting in his private capacity and not on behalf of the Post Office.

A Senior Representative (as defined in the national agreement on facilities for recognised unions) may
wish from time to time to represent the view of the National Federation of Sub -Postmasters,
particularly on matters affecting his Branch/ Committee/ Federation. In doing so he must indicate his
position as a Federation spokesman and give his own name.

when he ceases to be a Member of Parliament, provided he has complied with the arrangements for
naming a deputy and the sub-office has not been closed through normal changes during his absence;
should he fail to comply with these arrangements he will be regarded as having resigned on the day
he is elected. Ifhe is not elected he may resume office after the election result has been declared. A
Subpostmaster who is elected retains the right to resume office after he ceases to be a Member of
Parliament, provided the break in his service does not exceed 5 years.

{XE "Standing for Parliament" }

USE OF THE NAME “POST OFFICE”

12. A Subpostmaster must not use the name “Post Office” in connection with any of his private business
activities or in such a way as to imply that the Post Office is in any way connected with these activities.
{XE "Use of Post Office name" }

SECTION 14
NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES: APPEALS PROCEDURE
ALLEGATIONS OF NON-COMPLIANCE OR NON-OBSERVATION OF RULES
1, Although there may be instances where civil or criminal proceedings are contemplated in which it

would serve no useful purpose to call for a written explanation, in all other instances, and without
prejudice to any subsequent proceedings, any Subpostmaster will be afforded an opportunity of
giving a written explanation of allegations of non-compliance or non-observance of the rules which
are made against him.

2. At the discretion of the Retail Network Manager {XE "Retail Network Manager " }which will not
normally be withheld, the Subpostmaster may, if he wishes, meet the Retail Network Manager to
discuss the allegations. He may be accompanied by a friend while doing so. The friend must be aged
18 or over and cannot be someone involved in the enquiry. The friend must be a Subpostmaster, Sub-
Office Assistant or Post Office employee - and can be the local NFSP representative.

{XE "National Federation of Sub-Postmasters" }

3. As repeated breaches of the rules, even if minor in themselves, may lead to the determination, without
further warning or appeal, of the contract by means of the giving of three months notice, it is strongly
recommended that Subpostmasters take the opportunity to make such written and verbal
explanations of their actions at the time of the alleged breach of rules. A record will be kept by the
Retail Network Manager of any such discussions and of any written warnings issued to the
Subpostmaster.

{XE "Contract:Non-Compliance with Rules" }{XE "Contract:Non-Observance of Rules" }

REPRESENTATIONS ON POST OFFICE MATTERS

4. Without prejudice to the above a Subpostmaster may address at any time the Regional General
Manager {XE "Regional General Manager " Jand representation he may wish to make having
reference to his duties, remuneration or any other Post Office matter. The decision of the Regional
General Manager as to his response to such representations is final.

APPEALS{ XE "APPEALS" }

5. Ifthe Subpostmaster wishes to appeal against a decision to summarily terminate his contract for
services, he may do so either in writing or by personal interview and will be allowed ten (10) working
days from the date of the termination letter to make application,to a member of the Post Office
Counters Ltd “Appeals Authority{ XE "Appeals Authority" }” whose decision will be final. There is
no formal appeal against three months notice of contract termination or against termination with pay
in lieu of notice. Appeals on all other issues (e.g. recovery of losses caused by the Subpostmasters
negligence) are heard by the Regional General Manager whose decision is final.

{XE "Contract:Termination:Appeals against" }

APPROACHES TO PERSONS OUTSIDE THE POST OFFICE

6. Until the Subpostmaster has exercised his final right of appeal, he should not ask persons outside the
Post Office to take up the case on his behalf although this does not prevent a Subpostmaster from
obtaining such advice and support from the NFSP or any other outside person as may help him to
present his case effectively. The Subpostmaster should not detain Post Office papers or allow them
out of his custody for the purpose of such consultation without the permission of the Retail Network
Manager.

OFFENCES: SUSPENSION{ XE_"SUSPENSION" }: ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE INVESTIGATION
DIVISION{ XE_"INVESTIGATION DIVISION" }
1. Dishonesty is viewed most seriously and any Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant believed to have

carried, or taken part in, an act of dishonesty against Post Office Counters Ltd may be prosecuted.
Furthermore, any Subpostmaster so involved renders himself liable to summary termination of his
contract. The case ofan Assistant Post Office Counters Ltd may recommend to the Subpostmaster that
the assistant should no longer remain in his employ on Post Office Counters business.

{XE "Contract:Termination:As a result of Dishonesty" }

ARRESTARRESTS AND CONVICTION

2. A Subpostmaster must report to his Regional General Manager if he is arrested and refused bail, or if
he is convicted by a Court of any criminal offence (except a traffic offence for which the penalty has
not included imprisonment).

INIMMORALITY AND OTHER MATTERS OF PERSONAL CONDUCT

8 It is the aim and practice of Post Office Counters Ltd to maintain, to the maximum extent compatible
with needs of service to the public, an attitude of non-interference in the private lives of
Subpostmasters. However, where facts come to light calculated to cause public scandal or grave
embarrassment to the Post Office in connection with a Subpostmaster’s private conduct, the question
of his fitness for retention in office may have to be considered.

SUSPENSION FROM OFFICE

4. A Subpostmaster may be suspended from office at any time if that course is considered desirable in
the interest of Post Office Counters Ltd in consequence of his:

(a) being arrested, (b) having civil or criminal proceedings brought or made against him,

(c) where irregularities or misconduct at the office(s) where he holds appointment(s) have been established
to the satisfaction of Post Office Counters Ltd, or are admitted, or are suspected and are being
investigated.

5. Where a Subpostmaster is suspended his remuneration in respect of any period of suspension will be
withheld so long as such suspension continues.

6. On the termination of the period of suspension whether by termination of contract or reinstatement,
the Subpostmaster’s remuneration in respect of the period may, after consideration of the whole of the
circumstances of the case, be forfeited wholly or in part. If remuneration is paid any rent or other
expenses which may have been paid by him in respect of the continued use of his premises for Post
Office purposes during the period of suspension will be deducted.

{XE "Contract:Termination:Forfeited Remuneration" }

CRIMINAL CONDUCT: REPORTING{ XE "CRIMINAL CONDUCT: REPORTING" }

7. Ifa Subpostmaster has knowledge or suspicion of dishonesty or other criminal conduct affecting the
Post Office on the part of any person including a Sub-Office Assistant or a Post Office employee he
must, if there is any apparent need for immediate action, at once tell the Regional General Manager
sconfidentially of his knowledge or suspicion.

INDUCEMENT TO ACT CONTRARY TO RULES

8.

If any person should try to induce a Subpostmaster or a member of his staff to act contrary to the rules
(if, for example, he should be asked to datestamp covers irregularly with a view to either himself or
the offender afterwards enclosing therein betting slips or other communications relating to the result
of some race, game or sport) he should, while avoiding compliance (save in the case described in
paragraph 9) , also avoid putting that person upon his guard by definite refusal) The Subpostmaster
should as soon as possible tell the Regional General Manager what has happened giving a full report
and description of the person so that an immediate report can be made to POID {XE "POID "}and
instructions sought.

A Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant who is asked irregularly to put in course of post for despatch
or delivery from his own office a cover already date-stamped, addressed to a betting agent, and
presumably already containing a betting slip or other communication respecting the result of some
race, game or sport, should accept it and with it any bribe offered for compliance. He should at once
initial the cover and hand it and the bribe to the Regional General Manager, to whom he should report
as provided in the last sentence of paragraph 8.

THEFT BY STRANGER

10.

A Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant who sees a theft {XE "theft" Jof Post Office Property
committed by a stranger should inform the Police of the facts and then report the matter to his
Regional General Manager as soon as possible.

FAILURE TO REPORT DISHONESTY

ll.

In line with any employee of the Post Office a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant is expected to
report immediately any suspicion of dishonesty {XE "dishonesty "Jor criminal intent {XE "criminal
intent " }which may in any way affect the Post Office, whether the likely offender be connected with
the Post Office or not. He is similarly enjoined to render all possible assistance to officers of the
Investigation Division {XE "Investigation Division " }(see below).

ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE POST OFFICE INVESTIGATION DIVISION

12,

13.

The main job of the Investigation Division is to investigate, or help the Police to investigate, criminal
offences against the Post Office, British Telecommunications and the Department of National Savings.
The Investigation Division docs NOT enquire into matters where crime is not suspected.

Most of the crimes dealt with by the Investigation Division are committed by outsiders. It follows that
a common reason for Investigation Division officers seeking interviews with persons employed on
Post Office business is to get help in clearing up such offences. Usually the help takes the form ofa
witness statement that provides evidence about a particular act or acts that the witness has carried out
in the course of his or her duty.

NFSP00000760
NFSP00000760

14. Although they comprise the minority of all Investigation Division crime investigations, there are many
cases where the possibility (or even direct suspicion) arises that persons employed on Post Office
business may be involved. Officers of the Investigation Division conduct interviews about these
suspected offences and they are required to observe the same code of conduct when obtaining
evidence as that laid down for Police Officers. This provides for an officer investigating a criminal
offence to question any person, whether suspected or not, from whom he thinks that useful
information may be obtained. As soon as the Investigation Division officer has evidence which would
afford reasonable ground for suspecting that a person has committed an offence, he must caution him
before asking any questions about that offence. The caution must be in terms which make it clear that
the suspected person is not obliged to say anything unless he wishes to do so and that what he says
will be put into writing and given in evidence.

15. Ifa Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant is questioned as a suspected person by an officer of the
Investigation Division{ XE "Investigation Division" }, on statements made by a third person, and
expresses a desire to be confronted by that person, such confrontation will, if practicable, be arranged.
At the confrontation, the suspect will be at liberty to question the third person on his evidence and the
questions and replies will be recorded by the Investigation Division officer.

FRIENDS AT INVESTIGATION INTERVIEWS{ XE "FRIENDS AT INVESTIGATION INTERVIEWS" }

16. Atall interviews between Investigation Division Officers and a Subp ostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant,
the interviewing officer will first introduce himself, explain the nature of the enquiry, the ask the
person to be interviewed if he wishes to have a friend present. The introduction and explanation are
necessary first steps so the person to be interviewed knows what is involved when he makes his free
personal choice whether to ask for a friend to be present at the interview or not.

17. A friend invited to attend an Investigation Division interview must be aged 18 or over and cannot be
someone involved in the inquiry. The friend must be a Subpostmaster, Sub-Office Assistant or Post
Office employee - and can be the local NFSP representative. To avoid unreasonable delay and to
ensure that interviews will not commence until a friend, if requested, is present, the person being
interviewed will be asked to nominate alternative friends if the one first (or subsequently) chosen is
not available or may be involved in the enquiry.

{XE "Attendance:Investigation Division Interviews" }.

18. Ifa person being interviewed declines to have a friend present when asked but changes his mind later,
he may ask fora friend to be called at that stage. Ifhe is not questioned as a suspected person at the
outset (i.e. not under caution), but fresh evidence emerges during the interview which gives
reasonable grounds for suspicion, the Investigation Division officer will make this clear and explain
that he proposes to continue his questions after caution. Before the caution is given the Investigation
Division officer will ask if the presence of a friend is desired during the remainder of the interview.

47

NFSP00000760
NFSP00000760

A friend may only attend and listen to questions and answers. He must not interrupt in any way,
either by word or signal; if he does interrupt he will be required to leave at once and the interview
will proceed without him. Whatever is said at the interview is to be treated as in strictest confidence.
The friend may take notes of the interview but he must keep the notes in the strictest confidence. The
only communication the friend is entitled to make on behalf of the person who has been questioned
will be in the form of a written “in strictest confidence” statement which may be submitted by the
latter, in support of any official appeal which the person questioned may desire to make in connection
with the methods followed at the enquiry. No other communication about the interview is allowed
(unless made by permission of the Post Office) as it might constitute a breach of the Official Secrets
Acts. The questioned officer may, however, if he so desires, communicate the friend’s statement to the
National Federation of Sub-Postmasters in strictest confidence.

{XE "National Federation of Sub-Postmasters:Investigation Division Interviews" }

SEARCHES

20.

21.

Ifa person agrees to his property or house being searched by Investigation Division staff the
Investigation Division officer will ask, before the search is carried out, if he wishes to have a friend
present.

Investigation Division officers have no authority to search a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant or
their homes unless the have first obtained the agreement of the person concerned or they have
obtained a warrant to do so. In practice Investigation Division {XE "Investigation Division " }officers
only seek authority or permission to search when it is deemed absolutely necessary or in the interests
of the person involved (e.g. as a pointer to their innocence). If search by consent is carried out during
the course of enquiries which do not substantiate any suspicion that may have been directed at a
Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant, he will be handed at a later stage a written apology for any
inconvenience caused, coupled with a statement that he readily agreed to the search and that nothing
which would cast any doubt on his honesty was found.

SECTION 16

INFECTIOUS (INCLUDING CONTAGIOUS) DISEASES

i.

Subpostmasters, are expected to act on the advice given by their general practitioners or hospital
specialists, and to refrain from providing “Personal Service”, by taking leave of absence, through
sickness if advised to do so. This is both for their own good and that of others.

Contact with a person suffering from such a disease will only rarely exempt a Subpostmaster from
providing Post Office services, nevertheless the advice in Par. 1 may apply if the medical practitioner
so advises.

“Open cases” of Pulmonary tuberculosis must receive clearance from the Post Office, before a
Subpostmaster will be allowed to resume the provision of “Personal Service”.

If the local Public Health Department should require the temporary closing of the office, the Regional
General Manager will issue instructions as to the stock, etc. In such cases the question of continuing
payment of the subpostmaster’s emoluments subject to a deduction in respect of any saving in
expenses, will be considered on its merits.

These conditions apply equally to any assistants employed by a subpostmaster on Post Office duties.
Also, in such cases the question of meeting any loss sustained by the Subpostmaster or Sub -Office
Assistant in consequence of the latters enforced absence will be considered on its merits. It should,
however, be understood that the object of any payment that may be made by Post Office Counters Ltd
in these cases is to prevent there being any inducement to the sub-office Assistant to come on duty
when his presence would be a source of danger to the public or the Post Office employees with whom
they might come in contact in his Post Office work. Post Office Counter recognises no other obligation
in the matter.

TELEPHONE FACILITIES

PROVISION OF TELEPHONE FACILITIES

1.

The Community Subpostmaster must, in connection with his official Post Office Counters Ltd
business, and in the interests of security, arrange for the provision of telephone facilities at his Sub-
Office. The telephone installation should normally take the form ofa direct exchange line, although
exceptionally where the Community Subpostmaster resides on the premises, the Regional General
Manager may authorise, at his discretion, an extension plan installation comprising a portable
telephone and two sockets, one to be installed in the Sub-Office and the other in the Subpostmaster’s
bedroom.

REIMBURSEMENT OF INSTALLATION COSTS

2.

Post Office Counters Ltd will reimburse the Community Subpostmaster for costs incurred in the
installation of the required telephone facility, provided that excessive expenditure is not involved.
However, in the event that the Community Subpostmaster decides to have installed a system other
than that required by Post Office Counters Ltd, Post Office Counters Ltd contribution will be no
greater than the cost of installing a direct exchange line. If the Community Subpostmaster is required
to make provision for an extension plan system as described in sub-paragraph I hereof, but chooses
to have an extension socket in a room other than his bedroom, Post Office Counters Ltd contribution
to the installation cost will be no greater than would be incurred in respect of the installation ofa
direct exchange line.

REIMBURSEMENT OF INSTALLATION CHARGES

3.

On production ofa paid and receipted quarterly telephone account, Post Office Counters Ltd will
reimburse the Community Subpostmaster the rental charges, including the VAT element, appropriate
to the type of telephone facility that the Regional General Manager has agreed is necessary (see para 1
hereof). Rental charges which exceed the levels so authorised by the Regional General Manager
remain the responsibility of the Community Subpostmaster

CALL UNIT ALLOWANCE

4.

Each Community Subpostmaster is given for each telephone account period an allowance of call units
for official purposes, although any part of the allowance not expended in one telephone account
period cannot be carried over to the next. The Community Subpostmaster is required to pay for any
call units in excess of this allowance. The annual allowance is 130 units for a Community Sub-Office
which is within the same local call area as its local controlling Crown Office; 650 units where call from
the Community Sub-Office to the controlling Office are charged at British Telecom charge rate “a”;
and 1820 units where calls from the Community Sub-Office to the controlling office are charged at
British Telecom charge rate “b”.

EMERGENCY REPAIRS

5. Some British Telecom General Managers are prepared to provide emergency repair facilities for
Subpostmasters. The service allows for attention to faults reported:

(a) Monday - Friday between 1700 and 0800
(b) Saturday up to 0800 and from 1330 hours;
(©) allday on Sunday, public and bank holidays.

At other times normal repair facilities apply. Subpostmaster will be billed for use of the emergency
service on the normal quarterly bill and Regional General Managers will reimburse these costs on
presentation of the bill by the Community Subpostmaster.

REIMBURSEMENT OF VAT CHARGES

6. Post Office Counters Ltd will reimburse the Subpostmaster the charges raised for VAT at the standard
rate, in respect of that part of the total charges related to Post Office services, i.e. rental, the free call
allowance and emergency repairs.

SECTION 18

QUALITY STANDARDS

1.

Post Office Counters Ltd, through its network of post offices, aims to give customers and clients a high
quality service. The Subpostmaster must therefore give high priority to serving customers quickly and
efficiently, and to fulfilling the documentation requirements of clients with accuracy and
professionalism. Also the Subpostmaster will participate in “Putting the Customer First {XE
"Customer First" }” by attending the training sessions which form the programme and carrying out the
interim activity required between sessions.

{XE "Attendance:Training" }

The interim activity consist of commitment to display the Customer Charter {XE "Customer Charter "
jin the public area of the Sub Post Office, and to hand out questionnaires inv iting customer feedback.
On an ongoing basis questionnaires will be handed out at regular intervals, to be determined by
POCL, but not more than once every six months. In addition to the issue of questionnaires
Subpostmasters, particularly those in larger offices, will be encouraged to measure customer service as
described below. Subpostmaster’s Sub-Office assistants are also expected to undergo the “Putting the
Customer First” programme, either at sessions led by the Subpostmasters themselves, once they are
trained, or the retail network manager. Subpostmasters should make all reasonable efforts to
encourage their staff to participate in the training.

Payment for attendance at the four “off site” sessions, led by retail network managers, within the
“Putting the Customer First” programme, will be for travel and substitution {XE "substitution" }.

{XE "Attendance:Training:Payment" }
WAITING TIME

2.

The Subpostmaster should ensure that the time for which customers wait to be served is kept to the
minimum, and make any adjustments to the staffing pattern accordingly. To help achieve this
objective Subpostmasters in offices displaying the charter, particularly those in larger offices, will be
encouraged to monitor waiting times {XE "waiting times " Jusing the system developed by POCL.

This entails counting the number of customers queuing and the number of clerks serving, three times
aday and to supply the information to POCL to enable the results to be analysed and fed back to the
Subpostmaster.

While POCL has an overall national objective for customers to wait for no longer than five minutes
before being served, it is recognised that customers have different needs and expectations of waiting
time in different offices, and at different times of the day or week. However, Regional General
Managers will treat very seriously any evidence which suggests that the Subpostmaster is not making
all reasonable efforts to ensure that customer waiting time is minimised, to meet the needs of
customers locally.

TRANSACTIONS

3. The Subpostmaster will be responsible for ensuring that transactions are carried out accurately, that all
reasonable steps are taken to prevent fraud and that all documentation is properly completed and
despatched at the due time. Where under the terms of its contracts with its clients Post Office
Counters Ltd incurs financial penalties {XE "financial penalties " Jas a result of the Subpostmaster’s
failure in this regard, Post Office Counters Ltd may pass on this additional cost to the Subpostmaster.
The Appendix to this Section sets out the current maxima of the penalties which can be passed on to
the Subpostmaster. In such circumstances, Post Office Counters Ltd will furnish copies of the
appropriate documents as evidence in support of any action. Failure to properly complete accounting
and traffic information documents may lead to the exclusion in whole or in part of business transacted
for the purposes of determining payment.

{XE "Contract:Penalties" }

4. The Subpostmaster will ensure that customers are treated fairly, courteously and helpfully. Persistent
failure to meet the high standard of service demanded by Post Office Counters Ltd could result in
termination of contract.

or not any of the items purport to have been issued out of sequence. All the requisition forms for the
previous 3 months must at the same time be impounded and held by instructions. If, after careful
search, the missing items cannot be found and are thought to have been mislaid only, or inadvertently
destroyed, a preliminary report of the loss giving the serial number of the items in question must be
sent to the Regional General Manager.
