One I News Special

Saturday 27 January 2024

Post Office Chairman

Dear colleagues,

This afternoon, Post Office was advised that the Secretary of State for Business and
Trade, Kemi Badenoch, has asked Henry Staunton to stand down from his position as
Chairman of the Post Office. I wanted you all to be aware as soon as possible.

I want to reassure you that we have a strong senior leadership team in place and that this
decision will not impact on your role, nor the day to day running of the business.

Ben Tidswell, our Senior Independent Director, will chair next week's Board meeting and
we expect an interim Chair to be in place in the next few weeks whilst the search for a
permanent successor is found.

We will keep you updated and let you know when there is further news to share.

Thank you for everything you continue to do.

Nick Read
Chief Executive Officer
