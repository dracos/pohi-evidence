1 Executive summary

1.1 Sub-postmaster (SPM) survey

Perceptions of Horizon IT System

Nearly half (49%) of SPMs surveyed are dissatisfied with how the Horizon IT System currently operates,
compared to 25% who are satisfied. Those dissatisfied include about one in four who are ‘very dissatisfied’
(25%) and 24% that are ‘fairly dissatisfied.’ There is also higher dissatisfaction than satisfaction with the

training that they have received for the Horizon system (42% vs. 25%).

The vast majority (92%) of SPMs surveyed reported experiencing some form of issue with the Horizon IT
system in the last 12 months. This most commonly took the form of screen freezes (70%) and/or loss of
connection (68%). Over half (57%) said they have experienced unexplained discrepancies, with lower but
still significant proportions mentioning unexplained transactions (19%), missing transactions (14%) or
double entry of transactions (10%). Among those who have experienced an issue in the last 12 months,
about two in three (65%) say they have experienced these issues at least once a month. This equates to
about three in five (59%) of all SPMs surveyed.

Discrepancies on the Horizon IT System

Around seven in ten (69%) of the SPMs surveyed have experienced an unexplained discrepancy on the
Horizon system since January 2020. Of this group, just over one in three (35%) have done so as frequently
as a few times a month (17%) or once a month (18%).

Almost all (98%) of the SPMs surveyed who have experienced a discrepancy reported that they were
shortfalls, whilst around a third (34%) had also experienced surpluses. When asked how these
discrepancies were typically resolved, it was most common for SPMs to report using their branch's money
or to have resolved it themselves (74%). Among SPMs surveyed who have experienced discrepancies
since January 2020, more were dissatisfied (48%) than satisfied (19%) with how the discrepancies were
resolved.

Contracts

Just under two in three (64%) of SPMs surveyed could recall having received a contract from Post Office
Limited (POL) either before or after beginning their role. However, only approximately one in six (15%) said
they have received a full copy of the contract from POL which sets out their roles and responsibilities since
the 15th of March 2019 (the date of the Bates & Ors vs. Post Office Ltd Common Issues Judgment). Over
half (55%) believe that the terms of their contract are unfair, with about one in three (32%) feeling that they

are very unfair.

General perceptions of SPM role

When thinking about their role as a SPM overall, among those answering the survey just under half (48%)
feel dissatisfied with their role as a SPM, higher than the proportion (31%) who feel satisfied. Just over
seven in ten (72%) report feeling undervalued by POL, compared to 14% who feel valued.

The majority of SPMs surveyed disagreed that the POL board listens to their views (60%) and understands
the concerns of SPMs (74%). About half (51%) of those surveyed disagreed that POL is trying to improve
its relationship with SPMs, compared to the much lower 30% that agreed with this statement. When
provided with general statements on POL as an organisation, the majority of those surveyed disagreed that
it is: professionally managed (68%), trustworthy (65%), learning lessons from the past (55%) and a good
place to work (52%).

1.2 Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) survey

Overall perceptions of the HSS.

Nearly half of the HSS applicants surveyed were dissatisfied with the Scheme overall (49% vs. 12% who
were satisfied). This included about one in three (34%) who were ‘very dissatisfied’ and 15% who were
‘fairly dissatisfied.’

Just under half (47%) said they found it hard to understand the Scheme. This comprised of 29% who found
it ‘quite hard’ and 19% who found it ‘very hard.’ A smaller proportion (20%) said they found understanding
the Scheme easy. A similar pattern was seen when thinking about completing the paperwork. More found
this hard (57%) than easy (16%), with one in four (25%) in the middle.

Case Assessors

The majority of those surveyed (78%) reported that they have not received contact from a Case Assessor,
compared to 10% that had been contacted. When thinking about the service they received from their Case
Assessor, approximately half (49%) felt dissatisfied about how well informed they were kept throughout the
process while only just over one in five (23%) were satisfied. One in four (25%) reported being satisfied
with the contact they had with their Case Assessor compared with 46% who were dissatisfied.

Application outcome

Among those with an application outcome, there was generally high dissatisfaction with various elements of
the offer. This included ‘the offer amount’ (59% vs. 20%), ‘the time it took to reach an outcome’ (52% vs.
21%) and ‘the amount of information provided about how the outcome was determined’ (49% vs. 18%).

Suggested improvements for the HSS

When asked what could be improved about the Scheme, there were three main themes: speed/efficiency;
communication and transparency; and fairness and compensation. There was a sense that the process
was too long, with a lack of transparency — for example, the cause of certain delays or information about
how cases were progressing. Some applicants surveyed believed that the amount of compensation
received or offered was not sufficient, in particular to compensate for additional stress caused. However,
other applicants appreciated that the Scheme meant that POL acknowledged their fault, brought the issues

to light, and was an avenue to receive some compensation.

2 Introduction

Background and understanding

The Horizon system was introduced in 1999 by POL, with sub-postmasters (SPMs) experiencing
discrepancies and shortfalls in branch accounting data over the lifecycle of the new system including later
versions (i.e. Horizon Online).' Disputes between POL and SPMs have been ongoing over the last two
decades and the lack of a satisfactory resolution has led to the launch of group litigation against POL —
which has since been settled. In 2020, the Prime Minister committed to conducting an Inquiry relating to
this dispute, which was formally launched that year, with the scope amended in 2021. Since 2021, the

appeal courts have overturned convictions in 109 Post Office Horizon cases.”

The Inquiry aims to gather relevant evidence from affected persons, previous and current SPMs, POL, UK
Government Investment (UKGI), Fujitsu, the Department for Business and Trade (DBT), amongst others.
This report is specific to Phase 7 of the inquiry, which is due to start late-September 2024, and will examine
how POL operates today, whilst also investigating whether POL has fulfilled its commitment of “full and fair

compensation”.

The Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) was launched to independently assess applications from current and
former Postmasters who believed they may have experienced shortfalls related to previous versions of the
Horizon system.

Objectives
The key objective of this report is to assist Phase 7 of the Inquiry. The findings will be presented as
evidence and will inform Inquiry Chair, Sir Wyn Williams’, findings and recommendations. A researcher

from YouGov will also be questioned on the surveys’ findings.

As part of Phase 7’s investigation, two surveys were conducted by the independent market research firm,

YouGov, surveying two audiences — 1) current SPMs and 2) applicants to the HSS.
Survey content

The survey of current SPMs aimed to understand whether the SPMs interactions with POL and tools
provided by POL are sufficient at the present time in comparison with what POL has historically provided.

Key themes covered in the survey included:

¢ SPM contracts

¢ Horizon IT system and relevant training

* SPMs are self-employed business operators, approved by POL, to act as their agents in running Post Office branches (outlets)

3 Method

Questionnaire design

YouGov worked with the Horizon Inquiry team to produce two questionnaires, one for current SPMs and
another for applicants to the HSS. Details of the content of these questionnaires can be found in the
Introduction section of this report and the full questionnaires in Annex A. The surveys were provided in
English and Welsh language versions.

YouGov used their expertise and judgement to ensure that all questions were asked in a fair and balanced
way, doing so by using clear and concise language and providing all appropriate answer options for
respondents to be able to suitably answer the questions.

Sample
Those eligible to take part in the surveys were current SPMs in the UK and applicants to the HSS. Those
who were both a current SPM and HSS applicant received both surveys.

SPM survey invites were sent to 6,532 unique addresses and the file of 4,343 HSS claimant contact
records was reduced to 3,476 after de-duplication.

In total, 10,008 survey invites were sent and 2,498 responded to the surveys. The table below sets out the
numbers invited to each survey and the completion rate. If at least the first section of either survey was
completed, their responses were included in the analysis to be as inclusive of participants as possible.>

A breakdown of responses for each sample is given below. Respondents were provided with a prefer not to
say option for demographic questions, and in some instances, people dropped out of the survey ahead of
this set of questions meaning for a small portion of the sample demographic information is unknown.

survey this included anyone who completed the first set of questions about applying to the Scheme

Fieldwork dates
The research was conducted between the 18" of July and the 15" of August 2024.

Survey process

POL provided YouGov with lists of current SPMs and HSS applicants. The first stage was to clean and
verify the lists, removing duplicate email addresses. Respondents were contacted by email and a letter
(where both an email and postal address were provided). To encourage participation, those with an email
address were sent two email reminders during the fieldwork period.

EXPG0000007
EXPG0000007

YouGov

To ensure that those wanting more information on the survey, having issues with their link or wanting to
complete the survey in an alternative way (over the phone) could get in touch, a phone line and email
address was set up which people could contact. Overall, we assisted 190 people who contacted us over
the phone and 125 over email. This included conducting seven surveys over the phone with those who
preferred that method of taking part.

Ensuring validity of the sample

To ensure that the survey invite could not be forwarded to others resulting in multiple responses being
completed by those who should not have access, each potential respondent was assigned a unique survey
link which could only be used once. Once the surveys were completed, YouGov ran detailed quality checks
to ensure that all completed survey links matched the ones initially assigned to respondents. A total of 5
responses were cleaned out of the final data for the HSS survey which were identified as duplicates or test

responses.

Interpretation of the research findings
Due to limited information about the demographic breakdown of the SPM and HSS applicant populations,
the surveys are not weighted.

Differences between subgroups (such as men and women) are only reported in the analysis if they are
statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Analysis has not been conducted on subgroups with
fewer than 50 respondents.

Given that incomplete survey responses were included in the analysis, the number of people who
answered each question varies. This means that the base for ‘all’ respondents varies when shown below
charts.

Where percentages do not sum to 100, this is due to rounding or because respondents could give multiple
answers. In some cases the adding of two percentages (e.g. ‘very satisfied’ and ‘fairly satisfied’) may not
equal the stated net figure of the two responses which should be obtained by adding the frequency counts
(not the percentages) and dividing by the total.

When conducting analysis by ethnicity, most analysis compares those who are white and those who are
from ethnic minority backgrounds to ensure sufficient sample sizes. Those responding to the survey from
an ethnic minority background had a younger age profile than white respondents. Given that younger SPMs
are more likely to have been working as a SPM for a shorter period, this means that the findings between
age, ethnicity and tenure are often linked. For example, a survey response difference between white and
ethnic minority respondents might appear significant but the driver of those difference could be their age
profiles rather than ethnicity.

4 Sub-postmaster (SPM) survey

This section of the report presents the findings of the SPM survey, with 1,015 responses. The full
breakdown of responses can be found in the methodology section.

This explores the Horizon IT system including training, its current operation, advice and assistance,
transaction corrections, horizon shortfalls, suspension and termination and branch audits. Following this,
the report provides information on SPM's experiences and perceptions concerning their contract,

whistleblowing policies, senior leadership, and their general feelings towards being a SPM.

4.1 Horizon IT system training

The majority (66%) of SPMs surveyed recalled receiving some form of training on the Horizon IT system
more than 5 years ago. This was predominantly in the form of initial training (62%), with a lower proportion
saying they had some form of additional training (7%) or refresher training (4%). Just under one in five
(18%) SPMs said they did not receive any training (but were working at the time) whilst a slightly lower
proportion said they were not working 5 years ago (14%). Among those working at the time, this resulted in
about three in four (76%) who recalled receiving training on Horizon.

In the last 5 years, one in three (33%) said they had received training on the Horizon IT system, though the
majority (65%) had not. This was most commonly initial training. Among all SPMs surveyed, about one in
four (24%) reported this, rising to 72% of those who had been working (as a SPM) for 2 years or less and
82% of those who had been working for 3-5 years. Likely due to their overall tenure as a SPM, those
working for 2 years or less were more likely to recall having received any recent training (in the last 5
years). Eighty-seven percent reported this, compared to 15% of those working for 11-20 years and 14% of
those working for 21 years or more.

Those from ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to say they had received some form of training on
Horizon in the last 5 years (40% vs. 25% of white respondents). There were similar patterns by age, which
could be due to ethnic minority SPMs having a younger age profile than white respondents (and in turn
have been working as a SPM for a shorter time period). Younger SPMs surveyed (aged 18-39) were more
likely to recall receiving training in the last 5 years than their older counterparts (60% vs. 45% of 40-49s,
28% of 50-59s and 20% of those aged 60+).

Typically, initial training for Horizon lasted for more than one day. About half (49%) said it was 3 or more
days, and just over one in five (22%) recalled it lasting for 2 days. A lower proportion said initial training
lasted for 1 day (12%) or less than this (11%). Refresher training was less time intensive, with the majority
(71%) saying this lasted a day or less.

4 The not applicable option combines those who say they were working in the specified time period but have not received training,
and those who were not working at the time.

Most commonly, SPMs recalled training on general transactions (e.g. carrying out day to day transactions)
(88%) and balancing (73%). These were followed by general technical training (e.g. use of the software and
equipment) (38%), transaction corrections (25%) and dealing with discrepancies (21%). Fewer mentioned
training on use of the suspense account (13%) and dealing with technical issues (11%).

Overall, there were mixed views on Horizon training among those who said they received it. More were
dissatisfied than satisfied (42% vs. 25%), with three in ten (30%) sitting in the middle (neither satisfied nor
dissatisfied). The survey did not reveal notable patterns by age, though those aged 50-59 were slightly
more likely to be dissatisfied (rising to 50%).

Those who had worked as a SPM for a shorter time were more likely to say they were satisfied with Horizon
training. Among those who had been working for 2 years or less, about half (51%) reported this. Whilst for
those who had been working for 6-10 years, 11-20 years and 21 or more years, satisfaction is closer to one

in five.

4.2 The Horizon IT system in operation now

There is a similar pattern when looking at how the Horizon IT system currently operates; overall, more say
they are dissatisfied than satisfied with its operation (49% vs. 25%). This includes about one in four who
are very dissatisfied (25%) and fairly dissatisfied (24%). A similar proportion (26%) are in the middle (saying
they are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied).

Base: All (n=996 )

When looking at satisfaction with how Horizon currently operates by length of service, those working for 2
years or less are most likely to say they are satisfied (37%). This is comparable to the proportion saying
they are dissatisfied (39%), suggesting overall opinions among this group are split. Those working for 6-10
years report the highest levels of dissatisfaction at 57%. This is much higher than the proportion who say
they are satisfied (20%).

There are no notable differences in satisfaction with how Horizon currently operates by gender, ethnicity or
region. When looking by age, those aged 60+ are the least likely to say they are dissatisfied (41% vs. 54%
for those aged under 60).

The vast majority (92%) of SPMs surveyed reported experiencing some form of issue with the Horizon IT
system in the last 12 months. Most commonly this was screen freezes (70%) and/or loss of connection
(68%). Over half (57%) said they have experienced unexplained discrepancies, with lower (but still
significant) proportions mentioning unexplained transactions (19%), missing transactions (14%) or double
entry of transactions (10%). In the open-ended comments, many SPMs mentioned the current issues
relating to Horizon, for example “In my opinion Horizon is still flawed I regularly have unexplained
discrepancies often altering daily or manifesting at balance.” One in six (16%) mentioned experiencing an

issue not listed, with just six percent saying they have not experienced any issues.

There is a clear link between overall perceptions of the Horizon IT system and the types of issues SPMs

have experienced in the last 12 months. Whilst the majority (81%) of those satisfied with the Horizon IT

system reported experiencing an issue in the last 12 months, this tended to be screen freezes (55%), loss

of connection (52%) and issues with the PIN pad (47%), as opposed to unexplained issues. Those

dissatisfied were much more likely than those satisfied to report issues such as unexplained discrepancies

(77% vs. 27%), unexplained transactions (30% vs. 7%), missing transactions (24% vs. 3%) and double
entry of transactions (15% vs. 3%).

Among those who have experienced an issue in the last 12 months, about two in three (65%) say they

have experienced these issues on a monthly basis:

A few times a week — 16%
Once a week — 6%
A few times a month — 33%

Once a month — 11%

4.3 Advice and assistance

In the last 12 months, the vast majority (97%) of SPMs said they had called the Business Support Centre

for assistance. This included just over half (52%) who called monthly or more:

A few times a week — 5%
Once a week — 5%
A few times a month — 25%

Once a month — 17%

Just over two in five (42%) said they called the Business Support Centre a few times a year, and three

percent said just once a year. Those aged 18-39 (10%) and ethnic minorities (7%) were more likely than

those in other age groups and from white ethnic backgrounds to report calling the Business Support Centre

a few times a week (4% of those aged 40+ and 4% of white respondents).

Among those who had called the Business Support Centre, the most common reason was for a technical

issue (76%). Following this was a balancing issue (46%), to query a transaction correction (38%) and to get

advice on using the Horizon terminal in branch (38%). Calling for advice on the Review or Dispute (ROD)

process was less commonly mentioned (28%).

Among those who had called the Business Support Centre, views were split as to whether the advice they
were given was tailored to their issue (45%), versus being generic (53%). Groups more likely to feel the
advice was tailored to their issue included:

« Women (53% vs. 39% of men).

e Those aged 60+ (53% vs. 38% of 18-39s, 35% of 40-49s and 42% of 50-59s).
e White respondents (47% vs. 39% of those from ethnic minority backgrounds).

e Those satisfied with the Horizon IT System (64% vs. 34% of those dissatisfied).

Among those who had called the Business Support Centre, SPMs were more likely to be satisfied than
dissatisfied with the service it provided (42% vs. 26%). About one in three (32%) sat in the middle, saying
they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. Those who felt that they received tailored advice were more
likely to say they were satisfied (71% vs. 17% of those who received generic advice). Groups most likely to
be satisfied included:

« Women (48% vs. 38% of men).

¢ White respondents (45% vs. 37% of those from ethnic minority backgrounds).

4.4 Transaction corrections

The vast majority (81%) of SPMs surveyed have had a transaction correction in the last 12 months, whilst
13% said they have not. SPMs from ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely than those who are white
to have received a transaction correction (85% vs. 79%), particularly those from Asian/Asian British
backgrounds (90%).

Figure 11. Whether received a transaction correction in last 12 months

mYes =No = Don't know/can't remember

Base: All (n=980)

Of those who have had a transaction correction in the last 12 months, 46% have disputed at least one.
Younger SPMs (aged 18-39) were more likely than average to have disputed a correction (68%), as were
those from ethnic minority backgrounds (58%) and those who have been a SPM for 2 years or less (63%).
It is worth noting that ethnic minority SPMs surveyed were more likely to be younger and report shorter
tenure than white respondents, so these findings are likely linked.

Turning to look at satisfaction levels with transaction corrections, one in four (25%) SPMs surveyed were
satisfied with the ‘Review or Dispute’ (ROD) function, a way for SPMs to dispute transaction corrections
with POL, whilst 16% were satisfied with their access to sufficient data to be able to review or dispute
transaction corrections.

SPMs were more than twice as likely to be dissatisfied with their access to sufficient data to be able to
review or dispute transaction corrections than they were with the ‘Review or Dispute’ (ROD) function itself
(48% vs. 23%).

4.5 Horizon shortfalls

Around seven in ten (69%) of SPMs surveyed reported that they have experienced an unexplained
discrepancy on the Horizon system since January 2020. Those who have been working as a SPM for
between 6-10 years were most likely to have reported experiencing this (83%), whilst those who have been
a SPM for more than 21 years were least likely (61%).

Of the SPMs surveyed who reported experiencing an unexplained discrepancy since January 2020, just
over one in three (35%) have done so as frequently as a few times a month (17%) or once a month (18%).
A further one in four (25%) of those who experienced an unexplained discrepancy since January 2020 said
they had done so a couple of times a year, with 8% once a year, and 9% less often than once a year.

The vast majority (89%) of SPMs surveyed who reported experiencing an unexplained discrepancy since
January 2020 stated that a typical discrepancy was less than £1,000 — this included 50% who said less
than £200 and 39% between £200 and £999. Eight percent reported that a typical discrepancy was
between £1000 and £9,999.

Almost all SPMs surveyed who have experienced a discrepancy reported these were shortfalls (98%),
whilst around a third (34%) had surpluses, with SPMs able to have experienced both. Those aged 60+
were more likely than 18-39 year olds to have reported experiencing surpluses (42% vs. 25%), as were
SPMs who are white (44% vs. 17% ethnic minorities). Since older SPMs surveyed were more likely to be

white, these findings are likely linked.

When asked how these discrepancies were typically resolved, it was most common for SPMs to report
using their branch's money or to have resolved it themselves (74%). This was more likely among those who
have been a SPM for 11-20 years (82%). For example, a SPM expressed how “The Horizon system is still
flawed at month end we have seen a discrepancy where a cheque had been shown to be cashed on our
system which created a shortfall, we do not cash cheques as a local branch and this put us in a
discrepancy when we went to [the business support centre] they didn't resolve the issue properly and we
took on the loss personally.”

About one in three (34%) reported using the ROD function, and approximately one in five (19%) used
POL’s Business Support Centre. Notably, those who have been serving SPMs for less time were more
likely to have used the Business Support Centre. Indeed, 38% of those who have served as a SPM for 5
years or less have used the Business Support Centre to resolve disputes, whilst just 11% and 10% of those
who have served for 11-20 and 21 years or more respectively reported doing so.

Among SPMs surveyed who have experienced discrepancies since January 2020, more were dissatisfied
(48%) than satisfied (19%) with how the discrepancies were resolved. Those who have served as a SPM

for 5 years or less were most likely to be satisfied (33%), higher than those serving for 6-10 years (19%),

11-20 years (15%) and 21 years or more (16%).

4.6 Suspension and termination

Eighty-six percent of SPMs surveyed have never been suspended nor threatened with suspension, but
eight percent stated that whilst they have never been suspended, they have been threatened with
suspension in the past. This rose to 12% of those from an ethnic minority background, and 17% of those
who are Asian/Asian British. A further 4% reported that they had been suspended but reinstated,

SPMs surveyed from ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely than white SPMs to have been
suspended and reinstated (6% vs. 2%), as were those who have been serving SPMs for 21 years or more
(6%).

Of those who reported being suspended or threatened with suspension, this had most commonly occurred
4 or more years ago (81%). Indeed, for 38% of those affected it had happened 11 or more years ago, with
some saying this occurred 4-6 (21%) and 7-10 (22%) years ago.

4.7 Branch audits

Since January 2020, just over three in four (78%) SPMs surveyed stated that their branch has not received
an audit, and 12% reported that they have received 1 audit.
Those surveyed who have been working as a SPM for 2 years or less were more likely to have received an

audit since January 2020 (30%), compared with 12% who have been a SPM for 21 or more years.

Those who have received an audit since January 2020 were more likely to be satisfied than dissatisfied
with how it was conducted. Over half (57%) were satisfied compared with around one in five (21%) who

4.8 The SPM contract

Among SPMs surveyed, just under two in three (64%) said they had received a contract from POL either
before or after beginning their role, with it having been most common for SPMs to report that they received
their contract before beginning their role (45%). This differed by age group, with those aged 50-59 (23%)
and 60+ (21%) having been more likely than those aged 18-39 (11%) to have received a copy of their
contract after beginning their role.

™ Yes, before beginning current role = Yes, after beginning current role

=No = Don't know/can't remember

Net yes: 64%

Base: All (n=1,015)

Following this, of SPMs surveyed who reported having received a copy of their contract, a majority (68%)
believed that they did not receive any guidance or information about what the terms of their contract meant
before they signed it. This compares to just over one in five (22%) who reported that they did receive such
information. SPMs with branches based in England (59%) were more likely than those in Scotland (44%) to
report that they did not receive any guidance/information about their contract before it was signed.

The vast majority (86%) of SPMs surveyed who said they received information/guidance about the terms
and conditions of the contract before they signed it reported that it came from POL. However, only
approximately one in six (15%) said they have received a full copy of the contract from POL which sets out
their roles and responsibilities since 15" of March 2019 (the date of the Bates & Ors vs. Post Office Ltd
Common Issues Judgment). A further four percent said they received a copy of their contract (though in
part, not full). While just over half (53%) of SPMs surveyed said that they did not receive a full copy of the
contract.

SPMs surveyed who were aged 60+ and those have that worked as a SPM for 21 years or more (both 64%
respectively) were more likely than average to report that they have not received a copy of the contract
since the Bates & Ors vs. Post Office Ltd Common Issues Judgment.

When asked about whether they were provided with any guidance or information about the terms and
conditions of their contract by POL since the Bates & Ors vs. Post Office Ltd Common Issues Judgment a
similar pattern emerged to when SPMs were asked about the guidance and/or information they received
when they first started. Seven in ten (71%) SPMs reported not to have received any guidance or
information from POL since the Bates & Ors vs. Post Office Ltd Common Issues Judgment while only eight
percent reported that they had received something.

SPMs who have been in their role for 11-20 years (80%) and 21 years or more (79%) were more likely than
those who have served for 2 years or less (38%) and 3 to 5 years (46%) to report that they did not receive
any additional information about what the terms of their contract meant since the Bates & Ors vs. Post
Office Ltd Common Issues Judgment. The same pattern emerged when looking at age, with SPMs aged
50+ (77%) having also been more likely than average to report that they have not received a copy of their
contract since the Judgement.

SPMs were asked how fair they perceive the terms of their contract to be. Just over half (55%) believe that
the terms of their contract are unfair, with about one in three (32%) of that group feeling that they are very
unfair. This is a far greater percentage than the one in ten (10%) that believe the terms of their contract are
fair. Those who have served as a SPM for 11-20 years (62%) and 21 years or more (60%) are most likely

to feel that the terms of their contract are unfair.

4.9 Whistleblowing and complaints

General awareness about the ability to complain or about whistleblowing activities was low. Just over half
(55%) of SPMs surveyed were not aware at all about the ability to raise a whistleblowing concern with POL
compared with only one in seven (14%) that have raised a whistleblowing concern or knew how to do so.

A similar pattern of low awareness also emerged when SPMs were asked about the ability to complain
about the way they are treated by POL. Just over half (52%) of SPMs surveyed were not aware of the
ability to complain about POL at all. This is a far greater percentage than the one in six (17%) SPMs that
knew how to complain or have done so.

The low awareness about raising a complaint was also reflected when surveyed SPMs were asked
specifically about the way they were treated by their Business Support Manager or Area Manager. Nearly
half (48%) reported that they were not aware of the ability to complain about the Area or Business Support
Managers at all. About one in five (19%) SPMs stated that they knew how to complain about these
managers or have done so.

SPMs were also asked about their satisfaction with the way their complaint about POL was handled.
Among those who had complained, SPMs were more likely to say that they were dissatisfied (60%) rather
than satisfied (28%) by the way their complaint was handled. There was a similar pattern for those who
have complained about their Area or Business Support Managers. Just over one in five (23%) were
satisfied with how this was handled, a figure that is half the proportion of those dissatisfied (46%).°

4.10 POL senior leadership

Just over seven in ten (72%) knew that two SPMs were appointed to the POL’s Non-Executive Board of
Directors. Awareness was higher among those who have been SPMs for longer: 3-5 years (67%), 6-10
years (76%), 11-20 years (79%) and 21 years or more (75%), in comparison to those working for 2 years or
less (39%). SPMs aged 50-59 (73%) and 60+ (77%) were also more likely to be aware of these
appointments to the Board, because higher awareness could be linked to age and length of service.

Figure 27. Awareness that two SPMs were appointed to the POL’s Board as Non-Executive Directors

wYes mNo

Base: All (n=957)

Despite high awareness of SPMs being appointed to the board of POL, a majority (57%) disagreed that the
SPMs serving on the board share information with them, while only approximately 15% agreed. Those that
have worked as a SPM for 11-20 years (63%) and those who have experienced an unexplained

discrepancy by the Horizon system since 2020 (64%) are most likely to disagree that the SPMs serving on

the board share information with them.

The majority of SPMs surveyed disagreed that the POL board listens to their views (60%) and understands
the concerns of SPMs (74%). About half (51%) of those surveyed disagreed that POL is trying to improve
its relationship with SPMs, compared to the much lower 30% that agreed with this statement.

Across all three general statements about senior leadership, there was evidence of a link between length of
time as a SPM and the proportion that disagreed with each given statement. Those who have worked as a
SPM for a longer period (6 or more years) were more likely than those who have served less than 2 years
to disagree that the board listens to their views (64% vs. 24%), understands their concerns (79% vs. 46%),
and is trying to improve its relationship with them (55% vs. 30%).

4.11 General perceptions as a SPM now

Among those who answered the survey, just under half (48%) report feeling dissatisfied with their role as a
SPM, while about three in ten (31%) say they are satisfied. One in five (20%) sit in the middle saying they
are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. Dissatisfaction is slightly higher among men (53%) than women (43%),
though there are no differences by age, ethnicity or region.

As shown in figure 30, dissatisfaction is higher among those who have worked as a SPM for 6 years or
more with around half who say this. Those who have been working as a SPM for a shorter time period are
more positive about their role, with satisfaction rising to 47%.

The majority say they feel undervalued by POL (72%), with just 14% who feel valued. Length of time
working as a SPM correlates with feelings of being undervalued, just over three in four (76%) of those who

have worked as a SPM for 20 or more years feel undervalued compared with half (50%) of those with 2
years’ experience or less.

When provided with general statements on POL as an organisation, the majority of those surveyed
disagreed that it is: professionally managed (68%), trustworthy (65%), learning lessons from the past (55%)
and a good place to work (52%). Reflecting their lower levels of satisfaction and higher likelihood to feel
undervalued, those with 11 or more years’ experience were more likely to disagree with all the statements.
Potentially reflecting that those from a white background are more likely to have worked at POL for a longer
time, they showed higher levels of disagreement with POL being trustworthy (70% vs. 59% ethnic
minorities) and professionally managed (72% vs. 62% ethnic minorities).

Overall, when asked if there was anything SPMs would like to bring to attention to the Chair of the Inquiry
many mentioned feeling undervalued and underrepresented. Issues with the Horizon system and
insufficient training were also mentioned, along with feeling a lack of support and transparency from senior
leaders and POL.

For example, many SPMs feel undervalued due to not being paid enough for the work and hours they do.
Some SPMs expressed how difficult it is for them to pay bills on their current remuneration. SPMs also feel
a lack of recognition for their hard work. These feelings of being undervalued are exacerbated by feeling
dismissed and lacking support from management and POL.

“With the amount of work that's involved with running a sub post office we are massively undervalued and
underpaid. In line with inflation, rising costs and the amount of strain we are put under we should be paid at
least double the amount of remuneration to what we receive today.”

“You are valued by your customers, your community yet struggle to pay your bills after working long hours.”

SPMs also mention issues with the Horizon system, including unexplained discrepancies in their balances,
shortfalls in their accounts or errors in transactions. Many SPMs say they feel responsible when
discrepancies occur leading to them using their own money to rectify discrepancies. Some reported
spending a significant amount of time investigating discrepancies adding to feelings of being overworked.

“I often used to have discrepancies and shortfalls in my balance, usually in the hundreds when I had them. I
always trusted that 'I must have made a mistake’, 'The computer can't be wrong’. When I had

discrepancies, I would assume it was my fault and put money in from my own pocket to ‘make good.”

“In my opinion horizon is still flawed I regularly have unexplained discrepancies often altering daily or
manifesting at balance. When these are reviewed I’m being told this is [a] staff error, I have been

pressured/forced into setting a payment plan...”

“The discrepancies have been so high it has taken me 3/4 months to pay [them] back which has resulted in
me working for the Post Office unviable and resorting to staff reductions to cover losses, impacting on my
personal health and family.”

SPMs also cited insufficient training on the system, including how to deal with a discrepancy along with a
general sense of feeling unsupported if issues do arise. Some SPMs reported a lack of training in other
areas such as management. Some reported feeling that their concerns and issues are ignored or dismissed

by those in senior positions and sometimes receive conflicting information.

“The training the Post Office provided to me as a new postmaster was extremely insufficient. I was only
given basic training on how to serve customers and nothing on balancing the tills and dealing with
discrepancies.”

“Past training has always been concentrated on sales not actually on the use of the horizon system itself.
The number of reports available to the sub postmaster is shocking and when looking for possible errors
made or a glitch in the system it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack.”

“Not enough training, [senior management] left you alone for things, it’s [a] huge responsibility and new
Starters were left in [the] dark about [the] management of things and [the] day to day running of branch.”

“There is a distinct lack of training, a lack of consistency when [I] speak to people at BSC [the business
support centre]. Everything takes a long time to get an answer. [I'm] worried about declaring losses [due to]

fear of prosecution”

Overall, the data suggested some SPMs feel there is a lack of communication and transparency from POL.
SPMs report feeling left out of important decisions or uninformed about changes impacting their business.
Often SPMs cite senior management not understanding the challenges faced from running a Post Office
branch leading to a disconnect between SPMs and senior management. Other SPMs report not feeling
listened to and feel issues they have faced have not been adequately addressed. Some SPMs also report
feeling underrepresented, with one SPM citing that they “/ack any real negotiation power with the Post
Office”.

“Lack of communication with postmasters on their contract with Royal Mail: we get told information at the

end moment. Not giving Postmasters information in advance like [our] DVLA contract was running out.
Trying to keep information to themselves (PO) and we subpostmasters get told at the end once a decision

is made.”

“I think there is a complete absence of understanding of how a small, sub office within a community works.
The emphasis is on sell, sell, sell, make as much from your remuneration as possible.”

“Post office senior management keep saying they are listening to us but so far i haven't seen any evidence
to it.”

5 Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) Applicant Survey

This next section of the report presents the findings of the HSS survey, with 1,483 responses from
applicants. The full breakdown of responses can be found in the methodology, with the sample including
those applying on their own behalf, or on behalf of someone else.

The survey explores applying to the scheme, anticipated and actual claim amounts, legal advice, Case

Assessors, the Independent Advisory Panel (IAP) and the application outcome and offer.

5.1 Application submission

Among those who answered the survey, similar proportions said they had received compensation after they
applied to the HSS (47%) and that for them the process had not yet concluded (45%).

It was most common to have heard about the Scheme in a letter from POL or Herbert Smith Freehills
(HSF), with about two in five (39%) reporting this. Following this, a range of information sources were cited
including TV (19%), word of mouth (19%), social media (11%) and POL website (9%). A much smaller
proportion said they heard about it from their lawyer (2%).

The majority of those surveyed applied to the Scheme on behalf of themselves (91%), with a much smaller
proportion having applied as an executor or personal representative on behalf of a deceased person (4%).
Just one percent applied with lasting power of attorney on behalf of another person.

It was most common to have applied after the Scheme reopened in October 2022 (39%) or before the 27"
of November 2020 (24%). Seventeen percent had applied between the 27" of November 2020 and the
Scheme reopening in October 2022. About one in five (21%) said they didn’t know or couldn't remember.
Seventy percent of those who have applied to the Scheme, but said it had not yet concluded, had applied
recently (post October 2022).

Most made the application over email (64%) as opposed to a postal form (29%) and did not receive any
support when sending the initial application (74%). One in four (25%) reported getting some form of support
— either from a family member/friend (16%) or in the form of legal advice at that stage (9%). Most (76%)
remembered receiving an acknowledgement of their application though fewer recalled information about
how the application would be processed (29%), the next step(s) of the process (29%) and a copy of the
terms of reference of the Scheme (27%). Fifteen percent mentioned information about when to expect the
next correspondence, similar to the proportion remembering information on reasonable adjustments (13%).

Overall, perceptions of the ease of applying to the Scheme were more negative than positive. Just under
half (47%) said they found understanding the Scheme to have been hard. This comprised of 29% who
found it quite hard and 19% who found it very hard. One in five (20%) said they found understanding the
Scheme easy, whilst 30% found it neither easy nor hard.

Among those finding it easy to understand the Scheme, only four percent found it very easy (with 16%
finding it quite easy). Those who applied before the 27" of November 2020 were more likely to have found it
hard to apply to the Scheme (56%) in comparison to those who applied more recently (post October 2022)
(41%). Accordingly, those who applied more recently were more likely to say they found it easy (23% vs.
14%) in comparison to those applying before the 27" of November 2020.

A similar pattern was seen when thinking about completing the paperwork. More found this hard (57%) than
easy (16%), with one in four (25%) in the middle. Those who applied before the 27" of November 2020
were more likely to have found it hard to complete the paperwork (67%), in comparison to those who
applied more recently (post October 2022) (53%). Those who applied more recently were more likely to say
they found it easy to complete the paperwork (18% vs. 9%), in comparison to those applying before the 27"
of November 2020).

Those from ethnic minority backgrounds were slightly more likely to have found it hard to understand the
Scheme (58% vs. 43% of white respondents) and to complete the paperwork (65% vs. 54%).

5.2 Claim

It was most common for applicants to value their own claim at less than £20,000 (39%). This was followed
by £20,000 - £60,000 (14%). One in six (16%) valued their claim at more than £100,000.

The survey also explored how POL valued applicants’ claims. About one in four (26%) did not know or
could not remember. A POL valuation of less than £20,000 (39%) was again the most common response,
with only seven percent having a POL valuation of more than £100,000. This is notably lower than the 16%
who valued their own claim at this amount.

The lower the claim, the more likely applicants were to receive the same valuation from POL. Those valuing
their claim at less than £20,000 were most likely to receive the same valuation from POL. Just under three
in four (73%) valued their own claim within this bracket and received the same valuation from POL. Among
those valuing their claim at £20,000 - £60,000, 37% got the same valuation from POL (with 8% recalling a
higher valuation). For those with the largest claims (more than £100,000), only about one in four (26%)
received the same valuation. In fact, 46% said that POL valued their claim below this.

about one in four (27%) were unsure or could not remember.

their eligibility was rejected, while about one in nine (11%) stated none of the above.

Reflecting the low awareness of the right to obtain legal advice, just over one in eight (12%) actually
received legal advice during the application process. Among those that did, 11% received financial support
that they felt was sufficient, but 63% did not receive financial support.

When asked in an open-ended question to explain the reasons for not obtaining legal advice during the
application process, the most commonly mentioned reasons included: financial constraints, lack of
awareness about being able to access legal advice and trust in the system to handle their claims and
provide fair compensation.

“Didn't realise I needed to... also didn't want to incur additional cost.”
“I didn't know I could, it was made clear if I didn't accept the offer would be withdrawn and I'd be rejected.”
“lL wasn't sure what it involved and was still suffering anxiety which stopped me from obtaining any advice.”

“I was very sceptical of the outcome being favourable to me due to my previous poor experience of how
Post Office treated me during my tenure as a sub-postmaster.”

Other reasons included feeling that they had a lack of evidence or documentation to support their claim and
not knowing they could dispute the offer.

“...the criteria they set made it seem impossible to get any compensation. They were asking for copies of
cheque stubs or losses paperwork to prove any loss. Many losses we accepted ourselves and paid from
our own pocket.”

Some applicants also highlighted time constraints and personal circumstances as reasons why they did not
obtain legal advice.

“[ had lost my husband and didn't want to go through any more lengthy legal stuff.”
“I suffer from anxiety and depression and just wanted it all finished. I couldn't face a protracted process”

The majority (65%) of those who obtained legal advice during the application process were satisfied with

the legal advice they received, while seven percent felt dissatisfied.

Among those who have been informed of their application outcome, nine percent obtained legal advice
when they received the offer and, similarly to during the application process, the vast majority (88%) did
not. Unlike the minority who received financial support for legal advice during the application process
(18%), the majority (55%) of those who obtained legal advice when they received the offer received
financial support for this. Among those who obtained legal advice, 32% felt this was sufficient and 23% did
not. About three in ten (29%) did not receive financial support at all.

Base: All who obtained legal advice after receiving the offer (n=65)

The main reasons for not obtaining legal advice after receiving the offer are similar to those for not doing so
during the application process. Cost was a key issue, as well as it being too much hassle or not feeling able
to contest the amount. Many HSS applicants wanted the process to end, with some satisfied with their
offer. Other applicants did not know that they could have obtained legal advice.

“I wanted the whole long-winded process to end. It had dragged on and on and I had lost the will to prolong
it further.”

“L was happy with the amount offered”

5.4 Payments

Interim payments became available to SPMs after August 2022 up to the value of 80% of the claim.

However, the vast majority (82%) of those surveyed reported that they had not made an application for an
interim payment including one in three (34%) who were not aware that such an application was available.
Only 14% had applied for the interim payment. Those with branches based in England were more likely to
report that they were aware than those in Scotland (15% vs. 7%).

Just over one in five (23%) of those that have not yet made an interim payment application still intend to
apply. A higher proportion (39%) would make an application for a fixed sum payment of £75,000 if it was
available to them. However, this is still a far lower proportion than those who think they would not apply for
either a fixed sum payment (61%) or for the interim payment (among those who have not already applied)
(77%) in the future.

Fixed sum payment - Base: All (n=1,454). Interim payment — Base: those who have not made

The survey also explored satisfaction with the interim process and fixed-sum payment option. The evidence
indicates a relatively even split in opinion about the fixed sum payment option (among those who intend on
making an application), with a slightly greater proportion satisfied than dissatisfied (36% vs. 29%).

There is relatively more dissatisfaction with the interim payment process. A far greater proportion of those
who have made an application for the interim payment (or who intend to) indicated that they were
dissatisfied (48%), while only one in seven (14%) were satisfied with the process. This was further
supported by just over one in three (35%) having felt very dissatisfied by the process.

5.5 Case Assessors

The majority of those surveyed (78%) reported that they have not received contact from a Case Assessor,
compared to ten percent that had been contacted. Only one in eleven (9%) of those surveyed were aware
while about half (49%) were unaware that a Case Assessor's role is to assess the application and provide a
range of values for compensation.

The survey also asked those who have received contact from a Case Assessor about their satisfaction with
the service that they received. A common theme emerged of a greater proportion that were dissatisfied
rather than satisfied in each aspect of the service they received. Approximately half (49%) felt dissatisfied
about how well informed they were kept throughout the application process while only just over one in five
(23%) were satisfied.

Only one in four (25%) reported being satisfied with the contact they had with their Case Assessor
compared with 46% who were dissatisfied. The percentage differences between satisfaction and
dissatisfaction were evidenced further when respondents were asked about the time it took to assess their
claim. A majority (57%) of those surveyed were dissatisfied with the length of time to assess their claim,
with two in five (40%) who reported to have been very dissatisfied with this service. This is a far higher
proportion than those who were satisfied — with only one in six (17%) satisfied by the timeliness of the
process.

5.6 The Independent Advisory Panel (IAP)

The IAP was created to assess claims for the HSS and has a duty to recommend fair outcomes for
applicants. However, among those surveyed there was evidence that not everyone knew of the
involvement of the IAP. About one in three (32%) reported not having been told that the IAP would consider
their application — a slightly higher proportion than just over one in four (27%) who said they were informed
that would be the case.

A similar pattern emerged when those surveyed were asked about the role of the IAP, with approximately
two in five (38%) not aware that the IAP reviews the assessments and makes a recommendation on the
settlement. This is notably higher than the proportion of those surveyed who report that they were aware

that this was the case, with just over one in six (18%) aware of the IAP’s role.

The survey also explored the level of satisfaction with the IAP’s service, both in terms of the amount of
information provided about the IAP process and how long it took them to consider a claim. Consistent with
evidence of dissatisfaction with the length of time it took Case Assessors to assess their claim, respondents
were also more likely to be dissatisfied than satisfied with the length of time it took the IAP to consider their
application. Just over half (52%) were dissatisfied with the length of time it took for their claim to be
considered, with just over one in three (35%) very dissatisfied. This was considerably higher than the
proportion who were satisfied (20%).

Another aspect of dissatisfaction with the IAP’s service was the amount of information that the IAP provided
to applicants about the process. This was reflected by 46% having felt dissatisfied compared to 20%
satisfied.

5.7 The HSS offer

Among applicants surveyed who have not withdrawn their application to the Scheme, about half said they
had been informed of the application outcome (51%), whilst the same proportion (49%) had not. Those who
applied before the 27" of November 2020 or between the 27" of November 2020 and the Scheme
reopening in October 2022 were more likely to have an application outcome (73% and 71% respectively)
whilst those applying more recently (post October 2022) were much less likely to (19%). There were also
patterns by age, with those aged 60+ (who were less likely to have applied recently) more likely to have an
application outcome (55%) than those aged 18-49 (37%) or 50-59 (43%).

Among those with an application outcome, there was generally high dissatisfaction with various elements of
the offer. This included ‘the offer amount’ (59% vs. 20%), ‘the time it took to reach an outcome’ (52% vs.
21%) and ‘the amount of information provided about how the outcome was determined’ (49% vs. 18%).

In terms of the offer amount, there were no differences in levels of satisfaction by gender. Ethnic minorities
were more likely than white applicants to say they were dissatisfied with the offer amount (77% vs. 53%).
Indicatively, the data also suggests higher levels of dissatisfaction regarding the offer amount among those
aged 18-49 (82%), in comparison to those aged 50-59 (65%) or 60+ (56%).° This could also link to age,
given ethnic minorities have a younger age profile than white respondents surveyed. However, the same
age patterns are not evident for the time taken to reach an outcome or the amount of information provided.

Ethnic minority applicants were also more likely to express dissatisfaction with the time it took to reach an
outcome (71% vs. 46% of white respondents) and the amount of information provided about how the
outcome was determined (63% vs. 45%). Applicants with a branch based in England were more likely than

those in Wales to say they were dissatisfied with the time it took to reach an outcome (54% vs. 41%).

Among those surveyed with an application offer, the vast majority (92%) accepted the offer either in full
(87%) or in part (5%). A much smaller proportion (8%) said they rejected the offer. Those aged 60+ were
more likely to accept the offer in part or full (94%) in comparison to those under 60 (84%). Those in
Scotland were also more likely to accept the offer, rising to 99% (higher than the 90% in England).

Among those who accepted the offer (either in part or full), this tended to be due to wanting the process to
end as opposed to being satisfied with the offer. About half (51%) said they accepted it as they wanted the
process to finish, followed by thinking ‘the process was too complex/burdensome or due to financial
circumstances’ (both 33%). Only one in seven (15%) said they accepted the offer as they were satisfied
with it.

° Given the number of responses is low (n=45), this should be seen as an indicative finding only.

their claim did not go to The Small Claims Court or Arbitration.'' More were dissatisfied than satisfied with

the dispute resolution process (16 applicants vs. 4 applicants).

5.9 Overall perceptions of the HSS

The survey also explored overall perceptions of the Scheme. In keeping with earlier findings around
satisfaction with various elements of the Scheme, when thinking overall, more were dissatisfied than
satisfied with the Scheme (49% vs. 12%). This included about one in three (34%) who were very
dissatisfied and 15% who were fairly dissatisfied. Those who are younger (18-49) were the most likely
group to be dissatisfied (66% vs. 46% of 60+). Furthermore, satisfaction levels were higher amongst those
who have received compensation, compared with those whose application has not yet concluded (19% vs.
5%).

For all elements of the HSS covered in the survey, dissatisfaction was close to half, with a much smaller
proportion who said they were satisfied. This included feeling like ‘you had enough information to make
decisions’ (52% vs. 13%), finding ‘the Scheme easy to understand and navigate’ (49% vs. 14%), the time it
took from start to finish (48% vs. 10%), feeling ‘fully informed at every stage of the process’ (48% vs. 17%)
and the amount of compensation received (43% vs. 9%). For each element asked about, those from ethnic
minority backgrounds were more likely than white applicants to be dissatisfied. For example , 57% of ethnic
minorities were dissatisfied that the Scheme was easy to understand and navigate, compared with 46% of
those who are white.

Respondents were asked what, if anything, they thought was good about the Scheme. Analysis of the
open-end responses revealed that a common theme was respondents appreciating that the Scheme meant
that POL acknowledged their fault, brought the issues to light, and it was an avenue to receive some

compensation.
“That they considered to admit their fault and pay up”
“At least recognised I had been unfairly treated and had caused me distress.”
‘[It] felt gratifying to know that at last someone or group were being listened to. I wasn't alone anymore”

“I never expected Post Office to pay any compensation for Horizon after having it drilled into you over many
years that the system was infallible and you and all your staff were just inefficient... I was just grateful for

any recompense and wanted to be in receipt of such before they changed their minds!”

In response to being asked what they thought was good about the scheme, some HSS applicants found the
application process easy to navigate.

“The forms were easier than I expected.”
“The application process was quite simple and the application easy to complete”
“The process seemed fairly quick and open”

However, many HSS applicants surveyed felt that there was nothing good to be said about the Scheme.
They reported a lack of clarity, that the process took far too long, and there was an inadequacy of

compensation.

“I don't believe that the Scheme has any good features. It's been complicated, difficult and has taken far too

long to complete.”

“There was nothing good about it as I was told that I would be compensated about [amount removed] and
losses were more than that.”

“Nothing. It was a cover up to deflect from the lies and bullying we'd received as postmasters previously.

So many of us were unaware at the time, of the other postmasters who had been treated the same way.

We took the offer as we didn’t have the financial capability of carrying on with what seemed a hopeless
fight.”

The survey also asked applicants what they felt could be improved about the Scheme. Analysis of the
open-end responses revealed three main themes: speed and efficiency, communication and transparency,
and fairness and compensation.

In terms of speed and efficiency, some applicants surveyed felt that the whole process took far too long.

“The length of time without hearing anything. I recall on three separate occasions I emailed the scheme to
ask what was happening only to get a response saying that they were very busy and will be in touch
shortly.”

“Took too long to get redress. Had to keep chasing for updates via emails”
“The time taken to process claims considering how much they have ruined people's lives”

Related to this, some also felt that there was a lack of transparency surrounding the process, for example
the cause of certain delays or how their case was progressing. Indeed, some expressed that a lack of
consistent and clear communication led them to consider that the process was not transparent.

“Amount of time taken to assess case, continuous delays, lack of clarity on time for when a decision will be
made. Lack of consideration and interest in personal issues caused by the shortages and losing my

livelihood.”

“The Scheme should have been fully independent from the Post Office to ensure transparency and
fairness”

“The Scheme should have been more transparent and forthright in their communication.”

On fairness and compensation, some applicants surveyed believed that the amount of compensation
received or offered was not sufficient, in particular that it did not compensate for any additional stress
caused.

“No compensation for losses not proven plus the stress incurred over the period of Horizon being

introduced”

“[The] amount offered was about a sixth of my claim and the Post Office kept referring to ‘compensation’,
whereas I see this as financial redress and still cannot see why I am not put back in the position that I

would have otherwise have been”

“The compensation figure was an insult and did not do a dent in the amount of stress it caused me in my
life at the time”

“The compensation offered was a joke and did not come close to realizing the damage the Post Office had
done to people's lives.”

This survey is about the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS). Please note that Post Office Limited has
confirmed that it does not seek to impose any restriction on your ability to answer these questions, even if
you've entered into dispute resolution with Post Office Limited that is being conducted on a without
prejudice basis.

Some of these questions may also relate to matters on which you've received legal advice that is subject to
legal professional privilege. If you would prefer not to answer those questions, please tick ‘prefer not to
say.’

The term ‘compensation’ is used throughout this survey in line with the original shorthand to refer to
payments made through the schemes being administered by Post Office. The Inquiry recognises that other
terms, such as ‘redress’ are now in use.

The Inquiry’s only requirement is that any answers you choose to give are honest, but we encourage you to
respond to these questions fully and openly.
