Dear Sirs,

Re: Grant Allen
Chester Crown Court - 24‘ January 2013

We write to your firm as being the solicitors on the file representing this defendant in the
proceedings which resulted in him receiving a 12 month community order on the 24'
January 2013.

On the 8'" July 2013 a report into the operations of the Horizon system was published by
an independent organisation which had been commissioned by our clients, Post Office
Ltd. The report is known as the Second Sight Interim report. We have also received and
considered a second report, concerning an investigation into an incident at another post
office, the Helen Rose Report.

We have thorougly reviewed both the prosecution case and that of your client as put
forward in interview in the light of material contained within the Second Sight Interim
report and the Helen Rose report. We have also reconsidered our disclosure duties under
the CPIA 1996 and the Code of Practice enacted thereunder, and the A-G’s Guidelines on
Disclosure.

We have formed the firm view that, had the prosecution been possessed of the material
contained within the two reports during the currency of the prosecution of your client, we
should and would have disclosed that material to you in compliance with our disclosure
duties.

Accordingly we now disclose those reports to you so that you are able to consider whether
your client may have grounds for an appeal against his conviction.

We would also remind you of your duty not to disclose this material to any third party
other than your client; in particular the Helen Rose report is not in the public domain.

Yours sincerely
