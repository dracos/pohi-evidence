Introduction

Auditor’s Eye View
Scope

This functional specification defines the operational and commercial audit trails. These are,
respectively, the audit trail associated with the operation of the services which make up the
Horizon solution and the audit trail associated with that part of Post Office Account’s internal
commercial records to which POL’s Internal Auditors or Agents may have access as set out in
Schedule $3.

The operational audit trail includes that generated by the mainstream operational services and
the Business Incident Management System (BIMS).

The mainstream operational services are the services making up the POL steady state
applications :

Automated Payment Service (APS) including Additional Data Capture (ADC)
EPOS Service (EPOSS) including Debit Card (DC)

Order Book Control Service (OBCS)

Logistics Feeder Service (LFS)

Vv

Transaction Information Processing (TIP)
Network Banking Service (NBS) including NBE replacement

Infrastructure Services
> Transaction Enquiry Service (TES)

The Europay Mastercard Visa (EMV) extensions to NBS and Debit Card, introduced at
$70/75, while not being a mainstream operational service in their own right, do generate data
that is part of the audit trail.

The BIMS provides an auxiliary audit trail that separately covers the treatment of exceptions
encountered within the mainstream operational services. The audit trail associated with the
mainstream services is never modified for the purposes of correction as such.

This specification also addresses, in Section 3, certain elements of Schedule3 that relate to
access by POL’s commercial auditors to parts of Post Office Account’s own internal records
and systems. These latter requirements are met through the definition and use of a
commercial audit trial and associated audit procedure providing for access from within Post
Office Account.

The TMS Journal element of the operational audit trail, and other operational support and
system management elements relating to financial systems, are retained for 7 years. The

remainder of the operational audit trail, specifically data relating to APS, OBCS, TIP and LFS
is retained for 18 months. The commercial audit trail is retained for seven years although
some records are held for the life of the contract, which may be longer than seven years.

If the technology used to hold elements of the audit trail becomes obsolete then they will be
copied to the new technology to maintain continuity of access.

1.1.2. The Total Mainstream Horizon Solution

From the standpoint of the auditor, the total mainstream solution, including both the Horizon
sub-systems and the source and sink subsystems, is shown in Figure A. The arrows represent
the subsystem interfaces at which key auditable events occur. Horizon’s responsibilities
extend to the subsystems coloured green (dark lozenge) and the interfaces coloured blue (dark
arrows).

the course of operating the hardware and software and telecommunications platforms
themselves.

1.1.3. The Strategic Infrastructure Service
The Strategic Infrastructure Service (SIS) can be analysed as a number of “visible” counter
applications to which the post office clerks interface:
» EPOS Service (EPOSS) including Debit Card (DC)
» Automated Payment Service (APS) including Additional Data capture (ADC)

1.1.5.1 POL In-house Systems

The POL in-house systems that interface to the POL SIS are:

» Reference Data

> Transaction Information Processing (TIP)

» SAP Advanced Distribution System (ADS) for Inventory Management (IM)

The TIP system is batch-oriented, receiving large-scale files of the outlets’ transactions.
These comprise daily transactions, weekly (normally) stock holdings and a cash account,
daily AP Client summaries and daily BA transaction reconciliation reports.

The stock and cash account files are also produced within each office on paper. These signed
paper records will, foreseably, represent the fiduciary record of the outlet’s business.

The Reference Data system is responsible for supplying transaction steering data to Horizon.
This data describes the relationships and properties of the data to be processed (typing of
regions, POL organisations, outlets, Clients, items for sale, methods of payment, and
transaction tokens); and the processing methods (processing and validation rules, check digits,
calendars, accounting collation sequences, tax tables).

ADS is an on-line system but with a same-day level of response time. It handles orders,
secure stock returns, transfers and secure stock inventories, providing for central control
interfacing with Horizon’s Logistics Feeder Service (LFS)

AP Clients will have direct interfaces to the POL SIS for receiving files of payment records.
1.1.5.2 POL Client Systems

This level of specification does not define the audit facilities to be made available to the audit
departments of POL’s Automated Payment commercial Clients. These facilities will be
negotiated between POL and the Client as part of the AP Migration Plan Interface
specification for each Client. It has been decided by POL that such Client systems will NOT
access the POL SIS directly to provide customer and payment scheme reference data
(transaction steering data). Such data will be passed through the POL Reference Data system.

1.2 Audit Trail Responsibilities and Usage

1.2.1 Responsibilities
1.2.11 Tracks and Trails

In the description below use is made of the terms audit track and audit trail, An audit track is
a record of activities made within a Horizon subsystem for one or more of its interfaces. An
audit trail is one or more such tracks. The data recorded in a trail’s several tracks may
represent the treatment of related transfers and processing.

In general it is possible to produce an audit track for an interface on either side of that
interface, or, if the interface is itself problematic, on both sides.

It is of course a matter for POL and POL Clients to produce their own audit tracks on their
sides of the interfaces to Horizon.

1.2.1.2

1.2.2

1.2.3

TWO Tracks

The Horizon audit trail is based upon files representing the single main audit track
representing the traffic running through the Horizon solution, the POL SIS. This system is
Post Office Account’s operational responsibility and its operating interfaces are also under its
control.

As discussed above, a second audit track represents the systems management operation of the
Horizon system itself.

Principals, Agents And Rights Of Access

The underlying policy for access control is defined in the Access Control Policy —
RS/POL/003 (ACP) and the Security Functional Specification — RS/FSP/001 (SFS)

An Agent may carry out a particular audit for POL or by POL themselves. The Agents that
are permitted are defined in Schedule $3.

Horizon provides for rights of access for individual roles and enforces these rights of access.
Changes to these rights is via Change Control.

Access controls

Access controls are effected through the use of roles.

There are THREE auditor roles: POL Emergency Manager/auditor, POL auditor and POL
Client <C> auditor. It may not be necessary to represent the POL Emergency
Manager/auditor and POL auditor separately.

The POL auditor roles are further defined in the Horizon System Audit Manual —
1A/MAN/006 (HSAM).

The POL Emergency Manager/auditor has the same access rights as that of the Manager or
Postmaster. In addition, he/she may delete and create a Manager/Postmaster Role, and
produce a cash account. Access as POL Emergency Manager/auditor is via initial access as
POL auditor then, if required, as in the case of the Manager or Postmaster being unavailable,
a further exchange via the Horizon System Help Desk to obtain a one-shot password that
enables the additional Emergency Manager/auditor operations and a key reference that turns
on the filestore encryption/decryption.

POL Emergency Manager/auditor and POL auditor have access to all TMS journal records.

The POL auditor has no rights to modify the TMS journal. The POL Emergency
Manager/auditor is not able to modify the TMS journal, except as the auditable result of
permitted operations in connection with his role as an Emergency Manager. In common with
all journal updates, such permitted modifications are always in the form of appends.

The POL Client <C> auditor role when implemented will have access only to that part of the
TMS journal that deals with transactions pertaining to that Client and in accordance with the
Client organisation’s contract with POL. The POL Client <C> auditors have no rights to
modify the TMS journal.

The POL Emergency Manager/auditor has access only at the outlet. The POL auditor has
access at both the outlet and the centre. All access at the centre is via the Post Office Account
audit function.

POL usage

POL Audit functions has access to the POL SIS audit track and the Systems Management
track

POL Client Usage

POL Client Audit functions will have access to those parts of the POL SIS track relating to
that Client and subject to the Client’s contract with POL (subject to paragraph 1.2.3 above)

Audit trail formats
Native Formats

The principle followed is that Horizon originates the audit track source data in self-describing
flat files.

The format in which the TMS journal is written by Horizon operational software is that used
as input to the utilities that prepare the bulk extracts for the audit authorities. That is, the
native flat format is the operational format. This format is attribute grammar (keyword and
value) format and is self-describing at the field level. Subsets of the TMS journal represent
the data transferred to TIP, ADS and POL Clients, and from RD, ADS, possibly POL Clients.

The native format of the flat files containing the data transferred between subsystems is
described in file headers. They are therefore self-describing at the file level. See Host
Application Database Design and Interface Standards - TD/STD/001 (HADDIS).

The logs of file transfers (control files) are in one simple format.

Custom Formats

The TMS journal native flat format is not to be further transformed.
Custom formats for other audit files may be specified at a later level of specification.
Transfer is by CDROM.

As a principle, the less transformation the better, since this preserves more of the original raw
data and removes the need to qualify and maintain transforming software.

Audit trail retention periods

Schedule 18 establishes the retention periods for the Operational and Commercial Audit
Trails. These are, for the TMS Journal element of the operational audit trail, and other
operational support and system management elements relating to financial systems, 7 years.
For other operational systems18 months, and for the Commercial Audit Trail 7 years or
contract duration, whichever may be longer.

Operational Audit Data may be retained beyond the specified retention period if it is required
to support an ongoing POL investigation, or Litigation Support by Post Office Account, as
described in the CCD Service Description for the Security Management Service -
CS/SER/016.

Certain archived data such as EPOSS administration functions, which contain dated internal
references, will itself have an implied longevity of more than 18 months.

2411 TMS Journal

The audit archive of the TMS journal is taken daily at the correspondence server level by

copying all new messages that day to audit archive media.

The TMS journal comprises records appended to the journal of each outlet within a messaging
group usually in time sequence. Each group includes correspondence servers that hold a
replica of the outlet. The outlet replica(s) of the journal are housekept from the front
periodically to maintain a recent history to cover at least three cash account periods. The
correspondence servers’ replicas are similarly housekept.

The TMS journal contains the original transaction details, including its origin, when it
happened, who caused it to happen, and the outcome.

2.1.1.2 Horizon System Help Desk

The Horizon System Help Desk files contain the call records from the Automated Call
Distribution (ACD) system. These are written during operation and harvested daily into a flat
file. A control file will be written for each such daily file.

2.1.13 POL Systems

These comprise:

» Those at the TIP, RD and ADS interfaces holding control records describing files being
transferred

» There is no systematic value in holding separate audit copies of the raw data transferred
across these interfaces with TMS because this is what the TMS journal itself represents
and because the TIP and ADS transfers are selective extracts of it.

2.1.1.4 AP Client Systems

This comprises the various AP Client interfaces holding control records describing files being
transferred.

2.1.15 POL <DWP> Client
The specific DWP element of the POL Audit Track comprises the following files outside the
Pathway boundary :
» that at OAS with ESNCS
and within the boundary :
» that at OBCS
» with TMS
Any other intermediate file and table constructs do not form part of the track.
OBCS
This comprises:
» the Control Notice updates table for access by the OBCS TMS Loader Agent, and:

> OBCS transactions, comprising encashment transactions and totals table received from
the OBCS TMS Harvester Agent

The data used to represent these are the serial files transferred to and from OAS.

An audit control file provides as a permanent record of all files received and transferred by
OAS.

This file is kept permanently on-line within OAS(VME). It is also transferred in its entirety to
the Host server as part of the daily housekeeping process.

2.1.2 Audit Access to the POL SIS Track

Logical audit access will be provided as follows:

TMS Journal Access at the Outlet

Views of the transactions that have taken place within a whole post office during the recent
past are available from any counter or back office position within a post office, subject to the
POL Auditor having appropriate access rights. This recent past period for which transaction
records will remain at any workstation in the post office varies inversely with the traffic
conducted by that office as a whole, but is not less than the current and two previous cash
account periods, such periods being typically a week. The term “transactions” here embraces
both the serving of customers and EPOSS administration events. The journal is also used to
carry certain Horizon control sequences. These are of no intrinsic interest to auditors but their
retention within the message numbering means that auditors can be sure there are no missing
records'.

TMS Journal Access at the Correspondence Servers

Equivalent TMS journal data is maintained at each of the two Horizon Data Centres. These
are not copies of each other but are independently derived from the same original data by the
same systems. They will therefore provide a natural point of systematic reconciliation: for
example, on a sample basis it is possible to compare the audit track record of the same
transaction recorded in two places to verify that systems were operating consistently.

Audit records are written to audit archive media. They are presented in exactly the same way
as recent records when retrieved although will be subject to filters appropriate to the selection
and the audit authority for which the selection is being made. Archive records will take a
longer time to retrieve, the retrieval time being in proportion to the volume requested.

If and when the TMS service provider changes, then the TMS journal will be transferred to
the new provider as part of the transfer agreement. Apart from the longevity of data retention
and the associations of data with post offices, these views are equivalent to those taken in the
post office. It is understood that the vast majority of POL audits will be conducted within the
post offices, with resort to the Correspondence Server views only where the outlet views are
not available (denial, destruction) or, of course, where the historical record is required.

Access from one outlet to the data of another or to the back-history data on the
correspondence servers is not provided.

Although the bulk of the TMS journal data is transferred to TIP, Schedule $18 specifies that
the audit trail shall be maintained and retained by Post Office Account and protected by
security measures.

Horizon System Help Desk Log File Access

This comprises simple access to serial flat file. File selection will be by date or dates. Search
of the selected file will be by ordinary text search.

POL Systems Files Access

This comprises simple access to the control files, potentially followed by access to other files
transferred to the TMS journal.

2.1.2.5 POL Client Files Access

This will be defined at a later level of specification.
2.1.3 Auditor Utilities

2.1.3.1 Interactive Access

Access Using Keys

In both the post office and correspondence server cases audit facilities are provided to
retrieve, store locally, display and/or print one or more transaction records, with the selection
being based on simple keys. Key elements may be drawn from certain selected keys in the
transaction records.

These key elements will be:

one or more outlets as defined by reference data, e.g. POL Region

vv

stock unit

Clerk id

interval of time
POL Client identity

» one or more product codes

Vv wv

Other specific key elements may be defined at a later level of specification in the light of
experience.

The keys that an auditor may use will be in accordance with the auditor role.

Controls will be available to limit the selection to practical length. Initially this control will be
set at 256 records.

Disk serial files thus produced may be saved for later local search.

Access using Standard Reports

The following table categorises and lists the operations to be supported by POL auditor and
POL Emergency Manager/auditor use of EPOSS facilities, taken from notes of 17/12/96.
Auditor access to such operations is a function of POL auditor or POL Emergency
Manager/auditor role management. In all meaningful cases print or print-preview is provided.

Where access to the outlet itself is not possible, as for example when an outlet has been
destroyed by fire, equivalent access might be effected by visit to a correspondence server
centre or by restarting the outlet at an auditor centre or a replacement centre.

Bulk Access Using Keys

Bulk access is provided via the Horizon Data Centres only. A utility is provided to produce
bulk selections according to the role of the auditor and in the custom magnetic format
specified by the audit authority to which he belongs. POL Client audit authorities may
require different formats from those used by POL but Post Office Account proposes that they
be required to use the Horizon native flat format directly. Clearly, subject to the terms of
POL’s contract with a POL Client, the data accessed will be limited to that pertaining to that
Client.

Retrieving Operational Audit Data in support of POL requests is described in the CCD
Service Description for the Security Management Service — CS/SER/016.

In the event that the audit function requires direct, personal and extempore access to the actual
TMS operational journal then this access will be by attendance at a Post Office Account
location and will be supervised by Post Office Account staff.

2.2 Systems Management Track

2.2.1 Systems Management Track Content and Maintenance

The track is made up of audit events for the particular domain in question. In the Horizon
solution all events are generated within domains and eventually transferred to the Tivoli
Event Management Server.

Within these domains events are collected by Tivoli Agents and transformed into Tivoli
Events. On non-NT platforms the Tivoli Agent role is performed by an equivalent agent
function within the local systems management facility appropriate to the platform.

These non-NT platforms are:

» The Sequent Servers, whose events are relayed by BMC Patrol

> SUN Servers, whose events are notified directly

>» Network Devices, such as routers, whose events are mediated by HP OpenView
Audit events comprise:

>» System Events, which include Security Events

> Status Reports

> Sofiware Distributions

System Events are gathered from all domains, and Status Reports and Software Distributions
from all Windows NT domains.

Tivoli provides extensive event management facilities including central display, sorting and
filtering before viewing, for example, all operations initiated by a particular operator. These
facilities are accessed via a PC-based Tivoli Desktop available to the Fujitsu Services
Systems Management functions located in Stevenage and Lytham St Annes and connected via
the Horizon WAN to the master Tivoli Management Region, or hierarchic level that is at
Bootle.

These Tivoli Events are extracted from the Tivoli Event Management Server and archived
using the standard Archive Service. Filters are used to remove unusable operational events
before archiving. Archiving is in Comma Separated Variable (CSV) format.

2.2.2 Audit Access to the Systems Management Track
2.2.2.1 Interactive Access

Archived data may be restored from CSV format and viewed using native Tivoli facilities.

2.2.2.2 Bulk Access

This will be facilitated as follows:
» The Tivoli events will be archived daily

> Analysis can be either by Notepad-type browsing the archive file or by importing from
CSV format into a database or editor of choice.
