POLB08/07 FINANCE.FUNCTIONAL REPORT POLB(08)05

(a) Peter Corbett circulated the period 9 performance pack
and a budget summary. The following matters were
highlighted to the Board:

(b) the Company was on track to achieve a £30m loss, i.e. the
stretch target. Tight cost control and management of the
risks would continue to be essential to achieve this;

(c) an Operating Profit budget was being put to the ET for
approval on 17 January. This would meet the targets
providing the activity and discretionary spends could be
prioritised within a £36.5m cap. The budget and Operating
Plan would be reviewed with the Group Chief Executive on
13 February;

(d) cancellation of the ‘automation of First Rate Bureau Pre
Order’ has had some consequences for cost savings and
loss reduction and resolution of P&BA backlogs;

(e) the Board noted the period 9 performance pack.

POLB08/08: NETWORK FUNCTIONAL REPORT POLB(08)06
(a) The Board noted the report and in particular that:
(b)

(c) Income Migration: a number of BDM's would have
significant branch closures in their areas over the next
quarter. Their main activity was focused on delivering
income migration plans. However this. has been impacted
by the lack of marketing, support for a customer offer;

(d) Network Change: there were now 27 area plans that were
live and in various stages of the 25 week process. These
27 area plans involved 1418 activities, a mix of closures
and outreaches;

(e) Outlet Support: three recent cases where sub-postmasters
have been held culpable for part of the losses from
robberies had resulted in adverse media interest. The
situation had been reviewed and it appeared the challenge
was to handle:the process better rather than change the
rules. The risk of a more compassionate approach being
adopted was that there would be.an increase in instances
of fraudulent activity.

POLB08/10

(a) Total POL income at end P9 was £706.6m YTD, which was
£3.13m or less than 1% below target. Focus product
income was £83.47m YTD, achieving 94% of target;

(b) Credit Card performance:for the network remained well
above target (14%), but overall performance at POL level
is only at 79% due to the failure of direct performance to
achieve target levels. This was due to the decision at
POFS Board not to maintain investment in Direct sales of
credit cards due to increasing cost per acquisition and
adverse impact P&L performance. Crown performance
continued to support network. numbers, and overall the
network was forecasting to achieve full year target. There
were some issues concerning the levels of incomplete
applications received, which were adversely affecting total
sales. This was being jointly addressed by POL and POFS;

(c) performance in Car Insurance remained just above target,
‘although this was due to ongoing strong performance
within Direct channels. Network sales remained below
target (64%) and were not expected to recover until the re-
introduction of the £50 cashback offer in February;

(d) instant Saver sales had seen a significant drop off in the
last couple of weeks, but this was likely to be primarily due
to an expected downturn in savings activity in the key pre-
Christmas period.
