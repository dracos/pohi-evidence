Subject: GLO - latest version of the settlement agreement

Hi Kate

Could someone send me the latest version of the GLO settlement agreement. Just want to ensure that Im working off
the latest (accepting that there are still changes to be made).

In terms of timings, we do need to get this finalised soon and genuinely needs to happen today and preferably before
5pm. We have a meeting with the Permanent Secretary to give him an update at 3.30pm. Tomorrow, Nick and I are
travelling and will be unavailable as we are in the General Executive committee (in which he chairs and I am part of) and
then travelling to Chesterfield. We are in Chesterfield in an all day meeting and it is election day.

The milestones are:

Parties agree to the settlement deed

Notify Tim and Nick cc Patrick

Tim and Nick provide written approval to BEIS (by email) via Tom and Richard

Tom confirms the shareholder approval

Settlement deed executed

Internal and external comms released (subject to settlement deed — still being negotiated); Q & As to be drafted
and finalised

Ops plan for CU, HU — over wed -Friday

Manage press issues post comms publication

9. Hl embargoed judgment handed down on Monday

OU PWNE

Kind regards
