     Subject: Recent Exercise to review Audit in Horizon

Herewith some quick notes following the meeting held on Wednesday 3rd Sep.

Draft statement:

Peak 152376 triggered a review of the audit mechanism and of the Horizon counter's behaviour. This
review has been going on over the last two weeks. Our conclusion is that there is not sufficient evidence to
warrant continuing the review at the scale with which it was being conducted.
There are nevertheless some residual actions that need to be driven forward.

1. JB to review with Hilary over the extent to•which the programme might need to revisit the history of
AROs that are closed.

2. RB/PS/SM Audit and Security teams to progress changes to the current process to tighten any
weaknesses perceived therein in responding to Open ARQs.

3. AH to review and articulate a possible set of system changes-(with cost benefit analyses) that might
assist the revised process referred to above

4. PS with assistance fromaudit team - to review the words currently offered to Post Office in support of
ARQ requests and prosecutions in the light of the review run

5. SE to consult with Gareth Jenkins over risk and complexity of any changes that might shorten the locks
applies to the code.

6. SE to review the recent (but as yet unreleased) PCI & EOD implementations for manifestations of a
similar issue and to present recommendations arising from this review.

7.     RB to articulate and promote within HNGx the risk arising from the learning derived from this exercise




Annex (for ease of reference):

A list of the. Strands being considered at the last and earlier reviews:

      1. Digging into the History & checking old ARQs

      2. Keeping the ARQ Service Going & codifying the new process

      3. Possible changes of audit system to ease the new process

      4. Telling Who / What / When
         drivers: eg Mike Stewart's request

      5. Capping the activity in terms of expenditure and resource
         eg Steven needed to progress HNGx & anyway

      6. Investigating the underlying technical Problem
          Appear to have only 2 branch balancing problems

       + 2 others (one to do with harvesters & a dif stock unit)

       7. Digging through recent events/evidence.to assist with 6.

      8. Reviewing the words audit currently present to Post Office for correctness .(ie assembling the case)

       9. PMN - Lessons learned into HNGx - Reqt? / Risk Capture
