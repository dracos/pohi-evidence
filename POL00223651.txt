I am writing to inform you ofupdate-you-about a decision we have made regarding
the Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme which, as you know, we-was set up in
2013 to respond-in-relation to_claims of flaws in allegations-about Post Office Ltd’s
Horizon computer system and associated processes.

I am pleased to say that Post Office Ltd has now completed investigations into all
the individual cases put forward for consideration in the Scheme. Furthermore, I am
pleased to again confirm that no evidence has been found through these

investigations of any system wide issues with Horizon.

As a result, Post Office has decided we will now put forward for mediation all cases

remaining in the Scheme that have not been subject to a previous Court ruling.As-a-

applicants-complaint, (please see below for more detail on our proposed approach
to these cases). This will accelerate the conclusion of the Scheme =; in the interests

of Applicants and ensure that we fulfil the commitments we made to them at the

these cases carefully, on a case by case basis, even though mediation cannot
overturn a Court's ruling. Secondly, as a prosecutor Post Office has a continuing
duty after a prosecution has concluded to disclose immediately any information that
subsequently comes to light which might undermine its prosecution case or support
the case of the defendant. Applicants remain able to pursue the normal legal
avenues open to them to appeal Court decisions with any further material disclosed
to them, including that disclosed through the Scheme. Having now completed its
reinvestigation of each of the cases, Post Office has found no reason to conclude

that any original prosecution was unsafeHi Post Office-h: rt any

Should Aapplicants give their consent, the Post Office also continues to be prepared
to discuss individual cases, and our investigations, in confidence with_relevant
Members of Parliament or indeed to meet separately with individual Aapplicants to
discuss their cases. All Aapplicants have the benefit of the Post Office’s fresh and
comprehensive investigation into their case and the Post Office has requested
independent forensic accountants Second Sight to continue to be involved in the
follow up reviews.

We will work with Second Sight to support completion of their further report in order
that it is available to inform the ongoing mediation process.

The Post Office will also publish a report outlining the background and steps it has

undertaken to handle this issue.
