the ‘session-id's fiven above are not valid session ids! That is why they
cannot be found. They are all transaction ids which are part of session
H-145502. This is a very basic call and should NOT have got through to third
line. Please make sure that when specifiying a session id you do actually
specify the session id and not a transaction id.
