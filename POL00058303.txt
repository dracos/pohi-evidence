Jarnail,
Thanks for getting back to me.

1. You are right. I will explain that defence experts have attended sub post offices in the past to
anaylse data, but access to the system beyond that would need to be cleary specified and approved
by POL, before being allowed.

2. Two weeks from today takes us to Ist October 2012. In any event it is unlikely that he will be able
to prepare a report and for the defence to have time to get their own expert before 17th October
when the trial is due to take place. In the meantime we can inform Court we are working to an
estimate of 6 weeks for our report subject to confirmation on Gareth's return. Please can we confirm a
date for his report on his return?

I will amend the proposed email to Counsel in the above terms and keep you updated of
developments.

Regards

Andrew Bolc

1As you may be aware in the past defence expert has attended the relevant sub post office and been able to analysis the
relevant data etc. However this request is very vague and

General are you able to clarify specifies .

2 Garth Jenkins has previously provided reports in the past, he is presently on holiday for two weeks are able to wait for
his return?

Dear Jarnail,
Please see below draft email Iam proposing to send out to John Gibson of Counsel who is acting for
us in the above case, POLTD/1112/0203. It relates to the issue of disclosure re Horizon.

Andy Cash has asked me to seek specific instruction from POL on two issues therein:

1. Would we allow a defence expert direct access to Horizon system.
2. Is a 6 week timetable realistic for Fujitsu to prepare the report proposed.

Regards

Andrew Bole

Andy,

Following discussion with Harry, please see draft email to Outside Counsel in this case. I need to
confirm point 3 is correct. ie we would allow outside expert direct access to system; and point 4
report timescale is realistic.

thanks

Andrew

Dear Sir,

Please place the attached S.8 application together with the brief already held by Counsel, John
Gibson.

Counsel is invited to contact instructing Solicitors to discuss the prosecution response and should be
aware of the following:

1. Post Office Limited have appointed one of their investigators, Helen Rose as disclsoure officer
dealing with Horizon challenges.

She has prepared a document/ spreadsheet detailing all such cases, past and present, approximately
20 in total, although none thus far suscessfully argued in court. It is felt by by in house Counsel

POL-0054782
POL00058303
POL00058303

that this currently a working docuement and currently undisclosable as it contains some personal
opinion.

2. In addition to the 2nd Sight Review, POL have been advised to obtain, and are in the process of
doing so, an experts report from Fujitsu UK, the Horizon system developers, confirming the system
is robust.

3. POL maintain the system is robust, but in light of adverse publicity, the view of In- house Counsel
is that defence should be given opportunity to test system, should they still wish to do so, on

consideration of our report.

4. In light of defence request for disclosure, consideration be given to trial being vacated to allow 6
weeks for service of Fujitsu report and further 6 weeks for defence to act upon if needed.

Regards

Andrew Bolc
