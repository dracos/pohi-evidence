                         POST OFFICE HORIZON INQUIRY




           FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF GLYN ALLAN BURROWS




I, Glyn Allan Burrows will say as follows:



Introduction



   1. I am a former employee of Post Office Ltd.



   2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

       (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 23 August

       2023 (the "Request").



   3. I can confirm I was assisted by the Post Office in confirming insurance

       coverage for support in preparing my statement. I have also been assisted by

       DAC Beachcroft LLP in the preparation and drafting of my statement.

                                                                                  WI TN08690100




4. I have been asked by the Inquiry to set out my relevant professional

   background, explain a number of activities I have performed and the

   prosecution cases I have been involved in. I have tried my best to do this and

   have detailed my responses below.



5. I joined the Post Office on 6th October 1980 as a Postal Officer serving the

   public. I held this role for the next 12 years. I was promoted in January 1993

   to a CM3 Audit Manager. After this date and as a result of various business

   reorganisations I performed the following roles within different teams always

   under the leadership of a Line Manager:



      a. Audit Manager— Performing onsite audits at Post Office branches,

          managing a number of Auditors, and scheduling the weekly audit

          programme.

      b. Management Information Manager — Providing support to different

          teams on their performance against objectives.

      c. Compliance Manager— Performing compliance audits and issuing

          reports on the audit findings.

      d. Security and Investigation Manager— Performing investigations into

          various cases relating to Post Office branches.

      e. Network transformation Manager— Supporting Post Office branches

          that were converting their branch during the transformation

          programme.



6. I left the business in November 2018.

                                                                                 WI TN08690100




7. For the majority of my time within the Audit Team I reported to Martin Ferlinc,

   Audit Manager.



8. I have been asked by the Inquiry how I became a Network Field Support

   Advisor and Field Team Leader. I believe these roles were created after my

   time in the team. My role in the team was Audit Manager. This role varied

   over the years from completing onsite branch audits, to scheduling the weekly

   audit programme. My colleagues and myself were managed using the

   appraisal performance system.     Many of the Auditors had good experience

   and were very competent at running audits. In most cases my role in the

   actual audit was very limited as this would be delivered by the Lead Auditor

   with the support of their assistant Auditors. However, I would ensure I was

   there to support them should any questions or issues arise.



9. As a Line Manager within Post Office Ltd I was responsible for the day-to-day

   management of my direct reports which included allocating work, discipline

   matters and managing sick absence. In my role as Audit Manager I was not

   involved in interviewing those accused of criminal offences. I also did not

   have any involvement in the disclosure for criminal or civil proceedings or

   litigation case strategy. If the Investigation and Security Team required a

   statement they would contact me and this activity would be completed as part

   of their case.

                                                                                      WI TN08690100




   10. 1 have no idea how many onsite audits I have been involved in. I would say

      probably over 300. I have audited the following: Cash Centres, Stock Centres,

      Crown Post Offices, Franchised Post Offices, Modified Post Offices, Post

      Offices owned by Multiple Partners and Sub-Post Offices.




The audit process and the policies/practices in place



   11. During my time in the Audit Team I have been involved in reviewing, updating

      and creating audit policies linked to onsite audit activity. I can no longer recall

      which polices I was involved in or when this activity happened.



Recruitment and training of auditors



   12.The Inquiry have asked meto consider the following documents:

          a. Assurance Review - Recruitment (Vetting & Training) (version 1.0, 27

             October 2009) (POL00032698);

          b. Network auditing approach, methods and assurance" (2013)

             (POL00086765);

          c. Training & Audit Advisor (undated) (POL00088453);

          d. Audit Advisor (undated) (POL00088557).



   13. 1 believe the Assurance Review (POL00032698) was developed by my

      colleague during my time in the Audit Team but I do not recall this document.

      The other documents seem to relate to a time when I was not working in the




                                       Page 4 of 35
                                                                                   WI TNO8690100
                                                                                WI TN08690100




   Audit Team. My responses to the Inquiry are based on my own understanding

   from memory.



14.As far as I can recall if there was a position vacant within the Audit Team then

   the Audit Manager would decide how it would be filled. My memory of this

   process is that the position would be advertised internally and candidates

   would be selected following an interview. I do not recall any specific

   qualifications that were required to become an Auditor and individuals would

   be selected based on their suitability through the interview process.



15. From memory, but I can't be certain, when a new member joined the team

   they would follow a plan of activity and coaching. This would involve meeting

   different members of the Audit Team and going out to help on branch audits

   as an extra person so their colleagues could give them some on the job

   training.



16. From memory if new working practices or new products were developed then

   this would be discussed at team meetings or by smaller identified groups with

   a view to cascading these activities to the team so everyone was aware.



17. When new members of staff joined the team I think there was an induction

   process which would give them an overview of the team.



18. From my time within the Audit Team I believe it was an experienced team.

                                                                                   WI TN08690100




The planning and scheduling of audits



   19.The Inquiry have asked me to consider the documentAudit Plan &

      Scheduling, Chapter 1 of the Audit Process Manual (Version 8) (2010)

      (POL00084650). I think this document was produced after I left the Audit

      Team but I do recall some of the content. However, as I am not familiar with

      this document, I have provided my response to the Inquiry in regard to the

      planning and scheduling of audits from memory.



   20. Branch audits were scheduled using information from the Audit Programme.

      As I remember the Audit Programme generated the team's work. All Post

      Office branches were input into a computer programme with scores allocated

      against set criteria, for example, they were allocated a cash management

      score, then once all the data had been input every branch was allocated an

      overall score and the Audit Team were tasked with completing an agreed

      number of audits based on this programme. As I can remember this would

      have been agreed between my Line Manger, Martin Ferlinc, and his Line

      Manager, Keith Woolard, Head of Compliance.


   21.Special audits would also be scheduled into the weekly plan. These were

      requests from various people within Post Office Ltd who had a concern about

      a Branch and required an audit to take place. I would also have to schedule

      in audits where a Post Office branch was going to change hands to a new

      subpostmaster. This involved the Audit Team completing an independent

      check on the final balance of the outgoing subpostmaster before the new

      subpostmaster took over. As part of this process our support team would




                                   Page 6 of 35
                                                                                         WI TN08690100
                                                                                       WI TN08690100




      inform the Audit Team of the transfer date and I would schedule this activity on

      the date requested. Similarly if a Post Office branch was closing then the

      Audit Team would attend to check the final balance and verify the Post Office

      cash and stock agreed to what was declared on the final balance. Again

      these Audits would be scheduled in on the date they were requested. When I

      scheduled the weekly Audit plan, I would issue it on a Friday to commence in

      10 days' time.



   22. The onsite audit would be planned by the Audit Leader. They would obtain

      information from the previous audit report, if there was one, and obtain

      information from the Audit Planning File (I am not sure if this is the correct

      name but it was an Excel spreadsheet detailing various activities that the

      Lead Auditor used to help plan the onsite activity prior to attending the audit

      on the day).



   23. Over the years I think scheduling changed from branches being selected from

      the Audit Programme rather than a frequency visit (a fixed schedule when a

      branch would be audLed e.g. every 12 months or two years) but I could be

      mistaken.



   24.There was no difference in scheduling audits at Crown Office and Sub-Post

      Offices as far as I'm aware other than making sure you had enough Auditors

      available due to the size of the branch and the team's other commitments.

26. 1 have reviewed the documents but can only now recall the Audit Charter

   (version 4.0, undated) (POL00083966) (or a similar version of this document)

   from my time in the Audit Team. This details parts of the process including

   onsite auditing, post-auditing and scheduling processes which I seem to

   recall. I believe the other documents relate to a period after I had left the

   Audit Team and my response to the Inquiry is based on memory rather than

   these documents.



27. As far as I can remember from my time within the Audit Team, as part of the

   audit planning process the Lead Auditor would review the findings of the

   previous audit and obtain the relevant information from the Audit Planning

   File.


28. If a discrepancy was discovered at an Audit then the following steps were

   undertaken:

      a. The Lead Auditor would liaise with the person in charge at the branch.

      b. The figures would be double checked and then depending on the

           amount involved the Line Manager for the branch could be contacted.

      c. Then whatever they stated was to happen the Lead Auditor followed

           this and put it in the Audit Report.



29. The practice of asking for a shortage to be made good by the subpostmaster

   on the day of the audit was standard business practice. It was also the case

   that where an audit surplus was identified it could be withdrawn by the

   subpostmaster.




                                   Page 9 of 35
                                                                                    WI TNO8690100
                                                                                  WI TN08690100




30. The practice of taking payment for shortages was the standard audit process.

   If an audit shortage was discovered and was made good at the time within

   guideline limits then this would be reported in the audit report. Larger amounts

   would require the Lead Auditor to notify the subpostmaster's Line Manager

   and they would then follow their instructions.



31. The Lead Auditor would discuss the findings of the audit with the

   subpostmaster, or person in charge, at the end of the Audit. They would also

   discuss findings at various stages of the audit, for example, when the cash on

   hand had been counted, the first part of the audit process, the outcome would

   be discussed with the subpostmaster. If the figures produced by the Audit

   Team differed from the declared overnight cash holdings then it would be

   brought to the attention of the branch and the branch could complete their

   own checks and agree the figures.



32. From memory if a subpostmaster/subpostmistress or staff member in charge

   had made comments about the audit result this would be documented by the

   Lead Auditor who would ask the person to sign a statement. They would

   inform either the Line Manageror the Security and Investigation Team

   member of this statement. It would also be included in an extra audit report

   which would be produced bythe Lead Auditor.



33. My knowledge now of the Horizon system is very limited and I don't know if it

   would be possible to complete an audit without Horizon. I presume it would




                                Page 10 of 35
                                                                                    WI TN08690100
                                                                                  WI TN08690100




   require the team contacting other support teams to provide the required

   information which could be a few days to get the data. I can see from the

   document, Post Incident Auditing without Horizon, Chapter 14 of the Audit

   Process Manual (version 1.0, Nov 2006) (POL00084003), provided to me by

   the Inquiry, that you cannot produce an audit figure without Horizon, but I do

   not recall this document and was not specifically aware of this at the time.



34.The approach taken to auditing a Crown Office was based around risk as far

   as I can recall. This approach is focused on the assessment of risk to the

   cash, stock and other valued items. The approach for compliance was the

   same as far as I can recall. Crown Office branches are managed by a Post

   Office Ltd employed person who has responsibility for completing various

   management checks therefore the Audit Team's approach was to complete a

   percentage checkof live counter stock units and non-counter stock units.

   There were compliance tests for Crown Offices and other branches. The tests

   performed at each branch would be decided by the Audit Leader based on

   previous audit findings and current guidelines.



35. The Inquiry has asked me to consider the following documents:

      a. Audit Trail Functional Specification (version 8.0, 18 October 2004)

          (FUJ00001894);

      b. Global User Account (September 2016) (POL00002841).



36. 1 cannot recall seeing the Audit Trail Functional Specification (FUJ00001894)

   document and I don't recall the detail from memory. In regard to the Global

   User Account (POL00002841) I think there was a process for onsite branch

   Auditors to follow if they needed access to the Horizon IT system and I think

   you had to phone the Helpline to get a password



37.The Inquiry has asked me to describe any involvement Fujitsu had in the audit

   process. As far as I can remember Fujitsu had no involvement in the audit

   process during my time in the team.



38. 1 have also been asked by the Inquiry whetherAuditors had access to

   information which a subpostmaster did not have access to when they were

   conducting a branch audit. Auditors had information available to them from

   within the Audit Planning File as far as I can remember. This was an internal

   model used by the Audit Team only. They also had the previous audit report.

   This information would not be available to subpostmasters.



39. If my memory is correct and I am thinking about the same thing, the Audit

   Global User Account was available at every branch. This could only be

   accessed by Audit Team members as far as I'm aware. I think the Auditor who

   needed to use this had to phone up the Helpline and was given a one-use

   password but I could be mistaken with my memory of this.



40. 1 can't remember anything about any audit measures that were in place in

   respect of Audit Global User Accounts.

Involvement in the Security Team and training, instructions and guidance to

Investigators within the Security Team



   41. 1 was in the Security Team for around two years. This was a much shorter

      period then some of my other roles and I can no longer recall many details

      from my time in the team. I remember I completed the necessary training

      and was guided by the standard process documents when investigating

      cases. I felt I was more suited and preferred working on supporting branches

      which is why I left the Security Team to pursue other opportunities. In my role

      within the Security Team my Line Manager was Alison Drake, her Line

      Manager was Dave Pardoe and his Line Manager was John Scott, if my

      memory is correct.



   42. When I joined the Security Team I had to complete an Internal training course.

      Once the training course finished I joined a team and started by shadowing

      cases and the casework of my colleagues until I was given my own cases to

      lead. Depending on the case I would follow the process, complete the activity

      required, write a report on my findings which would be submitted along with

      my recommendations. If I remember correctly, this would then be reviewed by

      the Legal Team who would decide on the next steps.



   43. The Inquiry has asked me about what instructions, guidance and/or training

      was given to investigators within the Security Team about the following topics

      and how this was provided:




                                   Page 13 of 35

                                                                                  WI TN08690100




       a. interviewing a SPM / SPM's assistant / Crown Office employee who

          was suspected of a criminal offence;

       b. taking witness statements in the course of an investigation;

       c. conducting searches in the course of an investigation;

       d. the duty on an investigator to investigate a case fully;

       e. obtaining evidence in the course of an investigation;

       f. whether and in what circumstances evidence should be sought from

          third parties who might hold relevant evidence and, in particular,

          Fujitsu, where shortfalls were identified in branch;

       g. an investigator's disclosure obligations;

       h. drafting investigation reports to enable a decision to be made about the

          future conduct of a case.



44. 1 cannot recall the content of the training course or whether it covered all of

   these elements. From memory before I could join the Security Team I had to

   pass a test. Once I had passed this test my fellow new colleagues and I

   attended a two or three week training course based around the role. I think a

   further test was completed at the end of this course as well. As mentioned

   above, after training, I shadowed colleagues on the job. All my casework was

   reviewed and from memory I had to pass a compliance score to ensure it met

   the standards.



45. I have been asked by the Inquiry to consider the following documents:




                                  Page 14 of 35

      a. The Casework Management document at (POL00104747) (version 1.0,

         March 2000) and (POL00104777) (version 4.0, October 2002);

      b. David Posnett's email to you and others dated 23 May 2011 at

         (POL00118096) and the documents contained within the attached

         compliance zip file at (POL00118108), (POL00118109),

         (POL00118101), (POL00118102~ (POL00118103), (POL00118104),

         (P0L00118105), (P0L00118106) and (P0L00118107);

      c. David Posnett's email to you and others dated 27 April 2012 at

         (POL00118110) and the attachments at (POL00118120),

         (POL00118121), (POL00118122 (P0L00118123), (P0L00118124),

         (P0L00118125), (POL00118126 (P0L00118127), (P0L00118128).



46. 1 cannot recall if I saw the Casework Management documents (POL00104747

   and POL00104777)therefore I cannot comment on what my understanding

   was of these documents at the time. From memory I think compliance checks

   were completed to ensure the completion of the casework files achieved a

   standard set out by the leadership of the Security Team. I had no involvement

   with producing any of these documents or processes as far as I can

   remember. I think these processes had already been developed prior to me

   joining the Security Team.



47. 1 have reviewed the other documents attached to Dave Posnett's emails

   (POL00118096 and POL00118110) but do not recall their contents or my

   understanding of them at the time. I remember there were various documents

   which were provided to the Security Team with guidance on managing cases

      and filing reports but can no longer recall the details of these guidance

      documents. I had no involvement in the development of these documents

      during my time in the Security Team.



Prosecution of Carl Page



   48. The Inquiry have provided me with a copy of my witness statement in the

      proceedings against Carl Page (POL00093714). However, I cannot recall the

      exact details of this case against Mr Page and all I can remember is that an

      audit was performed at Rugeley Post Office and the Security Team were

      involved.




Initial Investigation by HM Customs and Excise




   49. As far as I am aware I first became involved in Carl Page's case when the

      Security Team requested an audit to be performed at the Rugeley Post Office

      and I may have been the person who arranged this at the time.



   50.As far as I'm aware, I was not involved in any activity prior to the audit. I am

      not aware of any Post Office audits carried out by members of staff from HM

      Customs & Excise.



   51. 1 don't have any memory of Staffordshire Major Crime Unit being involved with

      the case. However, it states in my Witness Statement (POL00093714) that Mr




                                    Page 16 of 35
                                                                                   WI TN08690100
                                                                                 WI TN08690100




   Patel from the Investigation Team made me aware that the Police had

   removed some cheques from the Bureau stock unit.



52. The Inquiry have asked me to consider the witness statement of Andy Dunks,

   Fujitsu Services, IT Analyst (FUJ00122250) and the request I made for a one-

   shot password after Carl Page reported a discrepancy. If I required a

   password then this was because it was the process. I would have used my

   access to the Horizon system to generate the reports required to undertake

   the audit.


53. The outcome of the audit was detailed in my Witness Statement

   (POL00093714) as a shortage of £645,345.18. This was made up of the

   following:


      a. £638,675.65— Cheques removed from the Bureau stock unit by the

          Police the night before the audit as I was informed by Mr Patel from the

          Investigation team. So these cheques were not included in the audit

          figures because they were not on hand.

      b. £3,583.14 — This was the difference between the cash and currency on

          hand in the Bureau stock unit and the Horizon printout prior to the

          Bureau stock unit being balanced. Once the Bureau stock unit had

          been balanced as part of the audit, the result, which was a shortage

          was reported as the figure above.

      c. £3,086.39 — Shortages in the Counter stock units compared to the

          Horizon printouts prior to each stock being balanced by the Audit team.

          Once the Counter stock units had been balanced as part of the audit,




                                Page 17 of 35

                                                                                      WI TN08690100




             the result, which was an overall shortage was reported as the figure

             above.


   54. 1 can no longer recall any further details regarding the shortage other than

      what I have noted above from my Witness Statement (POL00093714).



   55. 1 do not recall how long after Mr Page had taken over at the branch that this

      audit occurred. I think I may have attended another audit, or audits, at this

      branch. I think I was also part of the team onsite when the branch converted

      from a Crown Office to Sub-Post Office but I cannot confirm this. I don't recall

      being made aware of the financial position of Rugeley Post Office.




Audit of Rugeley Branch



   56. The Inquiry has asked me to consider the Case File Events Log

      (POL00093908) and my Witness Statement dated 11 April 2003

      (POL00093714) and provide my recollections of a call I received from Colin

      Price to arrange an audit of Rugeley Branch on 14 January 2003. I cannot

      recall the conversation with Mr Price but note from my Witness Statement

      (POL00093714)that Mr Price requested a special audit at Rugeley Branch.

      The purpose of a special audit is to audit a particular Post Office where other

      business colleagues have particular concerns.



   57. I cannot remember the full circumstances of this audit. Sometimes the audit is

      completed before the Security Team make themselves known at the branch




                                    Page 18 of 35
                                                                                     WI TN08690100
                                                                                   WI TN08690100




   and sometimes the Audit Team and Security Team go in together. I cannot

   remember what happened on this occasion.



58. 1 am aware from the information provided by the Inquiry that there was a team

   of four conducting the audit, myself, Kevin Orgill (Witness Statement of Kevin

   Orgill dated 31 March 2003 (POL00093733)), Alison Edwards (Witness

   Statement of Deborah Alison Edwards dated 31 March 2003 (POL00093897))

   and a fourth auditor. I cannot remember who the fourth Auditor was but in my

   Witness Statement (POL00093714) it says, "I confirm that the writing that

   appears at the top of this printout is that of my colleagues Mr Kevin Watkins."

   This would suggest he may have been the other Auditor that day. The role of

   the Auditors was to complete the Audit of Accounts and inform all the

   interested parties of the result. Who completed what roles would have been

   decided by the Audit Leader depending on what was needed at the different

   stages of the audit.



59. 1 cannot recall any discussions I had with Mr Page during this audit. I also

   cannot recall any of the discussions I had with Mr Patel or another member of

   the Investigation Team. I can see from my Witness Statement

   (POL00093714) that Mr Patel had informed me that the Police had removed

   some cheques from the Bureau stock the previous evening. The value of the

   cheques removed were £638,675.65.


60.The Inquiry has asked me to consider page 3 of Mr Orgill's Witness Statement

   (POL00093733) which notes that Mr Orgill passed documentation to me

   during the audit. I do not remember this now but it would have been normal




                                 Page 19 of 35
                                                                                      WI TNO8690100
                                                                                  WI TN08690100




   process for Mr Orgill to pass me, as Audit Leader, his audit working papers

   and any support Horizon printouts so this information could be input into the

   P32 Audit of Accounts for this audit.




61. 1 have been asked by the Inquiry whetherARQ logs were sought by POL from

   Fujitsu in this case and if not why not? I don't recall what ARQ logs are but I

   don't think they related to my role at the time and I am afraid I cannot provide

   any further information.



62. The Inquiry have also asked me to consider my audit report at page 47 of the

   Expert Accountants Report of David Liddell (POL00062201) and explain the

   findings of this report and what other documentation, if any, I completed after

   the audit. I can confirm that page 47 is not an audit report it is a printed

   account of the P32 Audit of Accounts completed at Rugeley Post Office on 14

   January 2003. This shows the account as £645,345.18 short. I cannot recall if

   I produced any other documents relating to the Audit of Rugeley Post Office

   on 14 January 2003.



63. My Witness Statement (POL00093714) confirms a copy of my written Audit

   Report was sent to Mark Irvin, Retail Line Manager, and Manish Patel,

   Investigation Team Manager. I cannot recall any conversations I had with Mr

   Irvin or Mr Patel about the Audit Report or any comments they made about

   the audit report.

                                                                                    WI TN08690100




   64. I have been asked by the Inquiry whose decision it was to suspend Carl Page.

      I do not recall who would have suspended Mr Page but my understanding of

      the process is that the decision would have been made by his Line Manager

      Mr Irvin. For clarity I would not expect this decision to be taken by an Auditor

      or anyone in the Audit team as they would not have the authority to make this

      decision.



   65. I cannot recall any other involvement I may have had in the investigation of

      this case but it would be normal that the Audit team would have no further

      involvement once the audit was complete and the Lead Auditor had shared

      the audit report unless any specific concerns were raised.



R v Carl Page



   66. I cannot recall if I had any involvement in any other proceedings against

      subpostmasters/subpostmistresses or other people who worked within Post

      Offices involving the Horizon system before this case.



   67. 1 cannot recall who asked me to provide a witness statement against Mr Page

      and Mr Whitehouse and I cannot recall when I completed my witness

      statement. I cannot recall who I had contact with during the drafting of my

      witness statement or the nature of any discussions I had with them.

   68. I cannot recall having conversations with counsel and POL's Legal Team

      about my role as a witness. My role in this case was as Lead Auditor at

      Rugeley Post Office on 14 January 2003.



   69. The Inquiry has provided me with the Witness Statement of Carl Page

      (WITN01510100) in which Mr Page recalls that I was questioned by his

      defence team at his trial. I remember I was cross examined about my job title

      a number of times until the Judge stepped in and explained his

      understanding. He then directed Mr Page's Legal Team to move on from that

      matter. That is all I can recall about giving evidence in court relating to this

      case but I'm sure there would have been a number of questions from both

      sides relating to the Audit at Rugeley Post Office on 14 January 2003.




The Prosecution of Tahir Mahmood



   70.The Inquiry have provided me with a copy of the Audit Report completed by

      Ms Edwards (POL00066040) which I have read. However, I do not recall this

      case and I cannot recall Mr Mahmood.




The Audit at Ten Acre Street Branch




   71. I cannot recall the circumstances in which I first became aware of this case. If

      I had any involvement in this case it would have been to contact Ms Edwards

      and MrAubby to arrange the audit. I can see from the Audit Report dated 3

   May 2005 (POL00066040), provided to me by the Inquiry, that I was copied

   into the report at the time but I do not recall anything about this audit and do

   not remember this report.




72. 1 cannot recall scheduling the audit but if this audit was scheduled during my

   time in this role then I would have scheduled the Auditors to attend. I would

   have had to contact the Audit Team and probably seek volunteers as this audit

   was performed on a Saturday. My selection of who would attend the audit

   would have been based on who was available as not all Auditors were

   available every Saturday.



73. I have been asked by the Inquiry what I thought about the size of the shortfall

   that was discovered and whether I had any concerns. I cannot recall this

   case so cannot comment on what my views would have been about the size

   of the loss but I would not have had any concerns about the actual result

   produced on the day by the Audit Team as I would expect each Auditor to be

   responsible for reviewing the figures produced in the Audit and ensuring they

   are correct. From memory the Lead Auditor, Alison Edwards, had good

   experience in the role and I would only expect to get involved in the audit if

   they had any particular concerns or if something was raised with me by other

   colleagues in the business.



74. As I cannot recall this case I don't know if any post-audit activity was

   undertaken or if I was involved. I also cannot comment on if I had any further

   involvement with this case post-audit. However, as noted above, I would not

      expect to have any further involvement in the audit once it is complete unless

      any specific concerns were raised with me.



The Prosecution of Seema Misra



   75. The Inquiry have provided me with a copy of the Investigation Report

      (POL00044541) and the Summary of Facts (POL00044613). I have read both

      document but I cannot recall this case or Ms Misra.



The Audit at West Byfleet Branch



   76. The Inquiry has confirmed that on 10 October 2005, Elaine Ridge requested

      that an audit be carried out at West Byfleet (POL00066397)and has asked

      me to describe the circumstances in which a special request for an audit could

      be made. A request for a special audit can be made at any time and for a

      variety of reasons, mainly based around concerns relating to Post Office

      funds at a particular branch. My role when scheduling audits was to action

      these requests. The Lead Auditor would also be informed of the concerns

      raised.



   77. I cannot recall this case so cannot comment as to when I first became aware

      of the potential audit at West Byfleet branch or what my understanding was of

      the alleged issues at the branch at this stage. Having read Elaine Ridges'

      Special Request of an Audit of Accounts (POL00066397), Ms Ridge has

      suggested there could be potential theft going on at the branch. Also, Ms

   Ridge stated that Ms Misra was a new subpostmistress and had some large

   discrepancies.



78. 1 cannot recall this case and cannot confirm what my role was in scheduling

   the audit at West Byfleet. If this audit was scheduled during my time in this

   role then I would have scheduled the Auditors to attend the audit. I would

   have checked the Audit Team plan for the date when the audit was to take

   place and make my selection of who would be asked to attend.



79. 1 cannot recall this case but under normal circumstances I would not have

   reviewed the audit findings. I would not have any concerns about the result of

   the audit produced by the Audit Team as it would have been down to the

   Auditors to check their own figures. From what I can see it appears that

   Keith Noverre was the Lead Auditor that day. Keith was an experienced

   Auditor and would have been very capable in his role. If Keith had any

   concerns he would have raised them with me and I would have addressed

   them accordingly. However, after this time I cannot recall if any concerns

   were raised.


80. The Audit Leader may have informed me of the audit result and the

   circumstances for the loss but I cannot remember if this happened or anything

   that was said about this case.



81.As I cannot recall this case I am unsure if I had any further involvement in this

   case or whether I was involved in any post-audit activity. However, I expect

      this was unlikely as the Audit team's involvement would generally end when

      the audit was complete unless any specific concerns were raised.



The Prosecution of Josephine Hamilton



   82.The Inquiry has provided me with the Investigation Report into Josephine

      Hamilton (POL00044389) which I have read, however, I cannot recall this

      case or Ms Hamilton.




The Audit at South Warnorough Branch



   83. 1 have been asked by the Inquiry to consider the email from Doug Brown to

      Rebecca Portch, which Mr Brown forwarded to me on 7 March 2006,

      (UKG100014734) and answer the following questions:

         a. Was this the first time that you became aware of the potential audit at

             South Warnborough branch?

         b. What was your understanding of the alleged issues at the branch at

             this stage?

         c. Doug Brown states that he would update you, did he provide this

             update?



   84. 1 cannot recall this case so cannot answer these questions fully. The email to

      Mr Brown from Ms Portch (UKG100014734) states she had concerns that

      funds would be missing at this branch. Having read the email there was no

   need for Mr Brown to update me as an audit had been planned to take place

   on Thursday 9th March 2006.



85. 1 have been asked by the Inquiry to consider the email from Rebecca Portsch

   (UKG100014734) and confirm what my reaction was to the suggestion that

   there might be a shortfall in excess of £20,000 at South Warnborough branch.

   I cannot recall this case but if our Cash ManagementTeam had concerns then

   it would be the right approach to see if we could support their concerns by

   arranging an audit at this branch to verify the actual cash and stock on hand

   at the branch.



86. 1 have been asked by the Inquiry to consider the email chain from Adrian

   Skinner on 7 March 2006 (POL00067205), in which I was copied, and

   address the following:



      d. Why do you think you were copied into this email?

      e. What was your impression of the issues at the branch having received

          this email?



87. I cannot recall this case but Mr Skinner would have copied me into this email

   (POL00067205) so that I could, if required to do so, pass on any information

   to the Lead Auditor. I cannot comment on what I felt about this case because I

   cannot recall it.

  88.As I cannot recall this case I do not know what role I played in scheduling the

     audit. If this audit was scheduled during my time covering this role then I

     would have scheduled the Auditor to attend the audit. I would have checked

     the Audit Team's plan for when the date of the audit was to take place and

     made my selection of who would be asked to attend.



  89. As I cannot recall this case I do not know if I played any part in analysing the

     results of the audit. I generally did not get involved with post-audit activity as

     the Audit Team's role would normally end on completion of the Audit. I cannot

     recall this case so cannot comment on what my views were at the time or

     about the size of the loss. I would not have had any concerns about the

     actual result as I would expect each Auditor to be responsible for reviewing

     the figures produced in the audit and ensuring they are correct. As with the

     above audits, the Lead Auditor, Alan Stuart, was experienced and capable in

     his role and would have raised any concerns about the result with me. I

     cannot recall any concerns that were raised.



  90. As I cannot recall this case I do not know if I became aware of the shortfall

     identified in the audit. I would have only become aware of the audit result if

     the Audit Leader informed me.



  91. 1 cannot recall this case but generally I did not get involved with post-audit

     activity.

   92.The Inquiry has provided me with the Investigation Report (POL00046485)

      and the Summary of Facts (POL00044623). I have read both documents but

      cannot recall this case or Ms Rudkin.




The Audit of Ibstock Branch



   93. As I cannot recall this case I cannot remember the circumstances in which I

      first became involved in Ms Rudkin's case. I would only have been involved in

      scheduling the audit.



   94. 1 have been asked by the Inquiry to consider the email from Doug Brown

      (POL00061712). As noted above, I cannot recall this case but if this audit

      was scheduled during my time covering this role, which I think it was as my

      name is mentioned in the email (POL00061712), then I would have scheduled

      the Auditors to attend the audit. I would have checked the Audit Team Plan for

      when the audit was due to take place and would have made my selection of

      who would be asked to attend.



   95. 1 have been asked by the Inquiry what my involvement was, if any, in the

      audit. I cannot recall this case but note from the Investigation Report

      (POL00046485) that the named auditors were Paul Field and Kevin Watkins.

      The only involvement I would have had, if any, would be to schedule the audit

      and support the team as required.

96. 1 cannot recall this case and therefore do not know the process by which the

   audit was carried out. Having read the Investigation Report for Ms Rudkin

   (POL00046485), after the admission by Ms Rudkin at the start of the audit the

   business practice at the time would have been to keep the Post Office closed

   until the full audit result had been achieved and the Investigation Team and

   the Line Managerof the branch had been contacted.



97. I do not know if I played any role in analysing the results of the audit as I

   cannot recall this case. I generally did not get involved in post-audit activity as

   the Audit Team's role would normally end on completion of the Audit. I cannot

   recall this case so cannot comment on what my views would have been about

   the size of the loss but I would not have had any concerns about the actual

   result produced by the Audit Team as I would expect each Auditor to be

   responsible for reviewing the figures produced in the Audit and ensuring they

   are correct. Again, Paul Field, Lead Auditor, was experienced in his role and

   would have flagged any concerns with me but I do not recall any concerns

   with this audit.



98. As I cannot recall this case I don't know if I had any further involvement with

   this case. However, as noted above, I would normally have no further

   involvement once an audit was complete.

99. 1 would have been aware of the concerns raised relating to the Horizon IT

   system during my time working for Post Office Ltd via any general

   communications sent to all members of staff on what the findings of any

   internal reviews of the Horizon IT system had discovered. As a Line Manager

   I think I would also have received any standard communications to relay to

   anyone who might ask my opinion or my direct reports opinion on the system.

   I can no longer remember what was said in any communications but would

   have relayed the messages to my team members as they were shared.



100.      I have personally never considered a challenge to the Integrity of

   Horizon and I cannot remember the guidance given at the time.



101.      The Inquiry have asked me to what extent do I consider the

   investigations into bugs, errors and defects in Horizon was sufficiently carried

   out by Post Office and whether I consider sufficient information regarding

   bugs, errors and defects in Horizon was passed to the Post Office by Fujitsu.

   I cannot comment on this because I was not involved with this process and do

   not recall any investigations that took place.



102.      The Inquiry has also asked me to consider whether I had sufficient

   information regarding bugs, errors and defects in Horizon and who provided

   me with the information. As mentioned above the only information I would

   have received about the Horizon system would be through business

   communications. I cannot recall any concerns or any reason why this was not

   sufficient.
