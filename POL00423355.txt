The Report

Is the whistleblowing policy fit for purpose?

1. The whistleblowing policy has been revised and updated (see Appendix 1). As part
of the process our external auditors reviewed it for compliance with the new
whistleblowing regulations for the financial services sector.

Has the policy been complied with in the year?

2. The previous version of the whistleblowing policy was complied with during the
year, but awareness of the whistleblowing line among employees is low.

How many reports of whistleblowing reports were made in in the year to 31 March
2016 and how does this compare to last year?

3. Seven whistleblowing reports were received in the year to 31 March 2016 (see
Appendix 2). This is an increase on the previous year, when a total of three calls
were received. This is still a low number given the total number of employees
within Post Office.

What else needs to be done?

4. The updated policy needs to be implemented. As part of this awareness of the
policy, the correct method of dealing with whistleblowing reports and the
availability of the Speak Up line and other methods to report whistleblowing will be
communicated to all employees.
