Hi Simon,

Regarding the 60+ number is referencing the requests that have received and processed on the new form since 20"
May. To be specific the actual number is 71.

The use of the POL spreadsheet stopped in March/April 2024, all requests (HSS or otherwise) since, have been received
and processed on the previous iteration of the ARQ form.

This change is not related to the recently amended ARQ form. The change was to ensure ARQs were received and
processed in a consistent manner.

If you can re-submit the 10 we have received via spreadsheet on the previous ARQ form, we will be able to process
them. I will also expedite this. For completeness we also received 1 ARQ on the previous form which we will now
process.

The above will enable all outstanding ARQs to be processed whilst discussions continue on the subject.

Thanks,
Dan

Hi Dan

Can I clarify that this means that the bulk process (which I understand involves the use of a spreadsheet) will be
accepted and processed?

I am not clear where the 60 number comes from, but I am aware of the rejection of requests that I forwarded to you, I
assume all of these requests will now be processed too?

Many thanks

Simon

Simon,
I refer to our recent correspondence on the issue of ARQs.

We introduced the updated ARQ form to clarify the intended use of ARQs requested by Post Office. FSL does not accept
that the introduction of this amended form has caused delay to redress activities. Since it was introduced, the Post Office
has requested over 60 ARQs to support redress activities and these have been processed by FSL in the usual way. As you
have now clarified that the ARQs referred to in your email below are intended to be used to support postmaster redress,
I will instruct the team to process those received on the previous version of the form and they will not be subject to
additional charges.

With regards to the provision of a credit for charges the Post Office has incurred in obtaining information used to support
redress, based on the confirmations contained in your letter of 10 June 2024, I will arrange for a credit to be raised which
reverses the charges for the 10 identified CWOs.

Kind regards,
Dan

Further to my earlier emails on this topic, we are now accumulating a backlog of requests, potentially delaying
Postmaster redress.

Can you confirm that FJ will process these requests without further delay please?
Thanks

Hi All,
As you can see below, we again sent our ARQ requests through to Fujitsu using the older process of master tracker and
summary table. Again, Sreydy Khun returned our request this morning, refusing to complete the request without us

completing the Updated ARQ Form attached.

Could you please advise next steps from us, as we have 10 ARQ requests outstanding now, as per the table below.

Outstanding Requests HSS3065 — HSS3069 Requested 17/06

Good Afternoon,

Please find attached an updated ARQ request tracker with a brief summary of all previous and new request(s) since our
last ARQ Requests.

This is replacing the ARQ Request Form which you advised us to start completing in April, as I have been instructed to
return to our previous, more efficient method with immediate effect. The instruction I received came direct from those
within Post Office, responsible for the relationship between Post Office and Fujitsu with regard to ARQ bulk requests.
