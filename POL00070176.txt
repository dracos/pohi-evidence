More information about Ferryhill which demonstrates an ongoing

Hi Lesley

The last one this week and then I am on leave for a week. These are the two visits that have direct reference to
losses although some from earlier years allude to problems with balancing.

Dear Mandy,
Mr Castleton has witnessed summonsed:

1. Bajaj

2. The subpostmaster at Ferryhill sub post office, West End, Ferryhill, County Durham; and 3. Mr Alan Brown,
Grangemouth sub post office, Falkirk, Scotland.

I'm up to speed on the Bajaj case but wonder if you could find out what the other 2 have complained about and
whether there are any proceedings afoot.

Kind regards.
