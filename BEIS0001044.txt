2.1 Overturned Convictions (OC)

Initial interim payments are available to eligible postmasters upon getting their conviction overturned on the
grounds that it was reliant on Horizon evidence.

A ‘full’ settlement comprises both pecuniary (financial) and non-pecuniary (personal) losses, but the Post Office
has been progressing non-pecuniary settlements first to get money to postmasters as quickly as possible, which
means a number of partial settlements have been reached in addition to the full and final settlements published
here.

From this month (January 2024), the department is now publishing data on full and final settlements. Claims
received are no longer being broken down into pecuniary and non-pecuniary settlements as in previous months.

2.2 Group Litigation Order (GLO) Scheme

Out of the 555 who were members of the Group Litigation Order, 63 postmasters had convictions and are
therefore eligible to apply for financial redress once their conviction has been overturned.

The remaining 492 postmasters are currently eligible for the Group Litigation Order Scheme, of whom 484
qualify for interim payments.

Progress continues to be made on distributing shares of the £19.5 million interim payments announced in June
2022.

For disclosure reasons, the exact number of claims paid is now withheld.
This month, the number of payments increased by less than 9.

Work continues on the remaining payments in complex categories such as those recently deceased and people
who have not taken up the offer of an interim payment.
We have adopted a new method of data collection for claims received and offers made for this month, which we
believe is more accurate in reporting only full and final claims and no partial claims. This means that we cannot
currently compare to previous months’ reported figures of GLO claims received and offers made.

A full claim on the GLO Scheme is defined as a claim which the Department for Business and Trade (DBT)
considers, with advice from its legal advisors, does not need any further evidence in order to assess every
element of the claim. Should the department consider further evidence is needed in order to make a full
assessment, this claim is no longer counted in our data as a full claim until such time that the required evidence

is received from the claimant or any other source. This means that the figures reported for number of claims
received may need to be revised.

2.3 Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS)
Post Office received 2,417 eligible claims by March 2021.

The closure date for applications was 27 November 2020, but Post Office continued to accept applications for
the original deadline group up to March 2021.

In October 2022, the government announced that additional funding would be provided so that eligible late
claimants could receive financial redress, and the scheme reopened for applications.

Post Office has received 336 eligible late claims to date.
Interim payments on the HSS are available before and after claimants receive an offer of financial redress.

The £93 million paid out on the HSS includes £21.7 million in interim payments to original claimants and £1.9
million in interim payments to late applications.
