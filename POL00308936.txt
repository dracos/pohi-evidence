Hi Pete,

In James absence, would you be able to take a look at the attached document please? Thank you for the responses.
provided to date, they are very useful.

However, as you know this paper is attempting to put an absolute end to Second Sight’s claims of Remote Access. I
have thus, attempted to place myself in their shoes and ask further questions to the responses provided (included as

comments marked “FJ”).

If you were able to provide answers to these it would be greatly appreciated. I appreciate this is incredibly tedious for
all parties involved — for which I apologise.

Mark

Please see our comments / edits on the document enclosed. I am out of the office from tomorrow for a week so can
pick up on queries when I get back. If they are more urgent, Pete can help in the meantime.
