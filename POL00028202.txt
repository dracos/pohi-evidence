On 15th May, 1996, the Secretary of State for Social Security acting through and on
behalf of the Department of Social Security and on behalf of the Department of
Health and Social Services for Northern Ireland (“DSS”) and POCL (collectively “the
Authorities”) entered into certain agreements (the “Related Agreements”) for the
design, development, integration and establishment by the Contractor of a
computerised service infrastructure and for certain services to be provided thereon;

Such agreements comprised:

wo an agreement between DSS and the Contractor for, inter alia, the provision
by the Contractor of services relating to a benefit payment card (the “DSS
Agreement”);

an agreement between POCL and the Contractor for, inter alia, the
provision by the Contractor of the POCL Service Infrastructure and for the
POCL Services (as hereinafter defined) to be provided thereon the (“POCL.
Agreement”); and

(ii) an agreement among DSS, POCL and the Contractor for the supply of a
service infrastructure and the provision of certain services which were of
common interest to both DSS and POCL (the “Authorities Agreement”);

Each of the Related Agreements has been amended from time to time in accordance
with the change control procedures contained therein;

On 24th May, 1999, DSS and the Contractor entered into an agreement under
which, inter alia, the DSS Agreement was terminated on that date;

On 24th May, 1999 POCL and the Contractor entered into an agreement (the
“Letter Agreement”) under which they agreed that certain changes should be made
to the POCL Agreement and the Authorities Agreement with effect from that date.

Under the Letter Agreement POCL and the Contractor agreed, inter alia, to replace
the POCL Agreement and the Authorities Agreement (each as amended under

change control procedures) with a single agreement (the “Codified Agreement”)

codifying the changes to those agreements agreed in the Letter Agreement;

This Codified Agreement is the Codified Agreement referred to in the Letter
Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

PART 1 : INTRODUCTION

101.3

‘The Codified Agreement

Without prejudice to Clause 810.10 of this Codified Agreement, each of the POCL
Agreement and the Authorities Agreement is hereby terminated and replaced by the
provisions of this Codified Agreement with immediate effect.

Amendments to Clauses, Schedules and Annexes of this Codified Agreement

The provisions of this Codified Agreement shall only be amended in accordance
with the Change Control Procedure.

Failure by POCL to perform its Obligations
The Contractor shall not be liable to POCL for any failure to perform or delay

performing its obligations hereunder where the Contractor proves that such failure
or delay has been directly caused by the failure of POCL to perform any of its

obligations under this Codified Agreement. This Clause shall not apply to Clause
809, which shall be governed by the specific rule stated in Clause 809.2.

Clause 102. _Interpretation

102.1

102.2

Clauses

As used in this Codified Agreement:

102.1.1 the terms and expressions set out in Schedule A1 shall have the meanings
ascribed therein;

102.1.2 the masculine includes the feminine and the neuter; and

102.1.3 the

gular includes the plural and vice versa.

A reference to any statute, enactment, order, regulation or other similar instrument
shall be construed as a reference to the statute, enactment, order, regulation or
instrument as amended by any subsequent statute, enactment, order, regulation or
instrument or as contained in any subsequent re-enactment thereof.

102.3 Headings are included in this Codified Agreement for ease of reference only and
shall not affect the interpretation or construction of this Codified Agreement.

102.4 References in this Codified Agreement to Clauses, Parts and Schedules are, unless
otherwise provided, references to the clauses, parts and schedules of this Codified
Agreement. References to GCDs and CRDs are to the documents agreed as such
from time to time.

102.5.1 Subject to Clause 102.5.2, in the event and to the extent only of any conflict or
inconsistency between provisions of this Codified Agreement, the following order of
precedence shall apply:

(a) the Clauses and Schedule A1;

(b) Schedules A2 to A145;

(©) the Service Definition Schedules and Schedule G6;
(a) Schedule 415;

(e) Schedule A16;

(all other Schedules except Schedule A17;

(g) CCDs and Schedule A17; and

(hy CRDs.

102.5.2 In the event of any conflict or inconsistency in relation to Service Levels, the
provisions of the Service Level Schedules shall prevail over those of the Service
Definition Schedules and Schedules A15, A16 and G6 (but not the Clauses or
Schedules A1 to A14) to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency.

For the avoidance of doubt, POCL acknowledges that a particular solution in
Schedule A16 shall not be treated as being in conflict or inconsistent with any
requirement in Schedule A15, or the Service Definition Schedules or Schedule G6,
merely because the solution states that the requirement will be met in a particular
form, manner, quantity, time or place.

102.8 Where any provision of this Codified Agreement requires or permits a matter to be
agreed between the parties or approved by either of the parties and such provision

agreement reached or approval given under the Authorities Agreement or POCL
Agreement shall be deemed to have been reached or given under the corresponding
provision of this Codified Agreement.

102.9 References in CCDs, CRDs and Schedules agreed prior to the date of this Codified
Agreement to NR2 or NR2+ shall be construed so as to refer to such of CSR or
CSR+ as shall be appropriate having regard to the functionality of the item or
service to which such reference relates, as determined by the SADD and any
relevant Release Contents Description. Likewise, references in such CCDs, CRDs
and Schedules to other items, services or matters affected by subsequent
agreements between the parties (including this Codified Agreement) shall be
construed to reflect most appropriately the effect of such subsequent agreements.

102.10 It is expressly agreed that Clause 201.6 and (notwithstanding that they refer to
CCDs) the definitions of “Core System” and “CSR +” shall take precedence over all
other provisions of this Codified Agreement (including the Schedules) which define
the Core System, CSR+, the Core System Services or the POCL Services.

Clause 103. Severability

of thi

If any of the provi Codified Agreement is judged to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the continuation in full force and effect of the remainder of them will not be
prejudiced but such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary in the court's
opinion to render such term or provision enforceable, and the rights and obligations of the
parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly, preserving to the fullest permissible
extent the intent and agreements of the parties herein set forth.

Clause 606.5), (ii) fire, (iii) flood, or (iv) any disaster or an industrial
dispute affecting a third party. Any act, event, omission, happening or non-
happening will only be considered Force Majeure if it is not attributable to

the wilful act, neglect or failure to take reasonable precautions of the
affected party, its agents or employees, and only if a substitute third party
is not reasonably available (having regard, without limitation, to the cost

and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation. In no
event shall any fraudulent act or omission by any third party or party in
relation to the POCL Services for which the Contractor is liable under
Clause 809.1 constitute a force majeure event.

Neither party hereto shall in any circumstances be liable to the other party
hereto for any loss of any kind whatsoever including but not limited to any
damages or abatement of Charges whether directly or indirectly caused to
or incurred by the other party by reason of any failure or delay in the
performance of its obligations under this Codified Agreement which is due
to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall use all
reasonable endeavours to continue to perform, or resume performance of,
such obligations under this Codified Agreement for the duration of such
Force Majeure event. In the case of the Contractor, the parties shall agree
an orderly process for such continuation or resumption of performance
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the
Contractor shall comply with such process. The Contractor shall remain
liable to perform the POCL Contingency Services, save where such POCL

Contingency Services are themselves also affected by Force Majeure, in
which case the Contractor shall be required to use all reasonable
endeavours to perform such POCL Contingency Services.

If the Contractor shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure
which give rise to or which are likely to give rise to any such failure or
delay on its part it shall forthwith notify POCL within one (1) working day
and shall inform POCL of the period which it is estimated that such failure
or delay shall continue. If POCL shall become aware of circumstances of
Force Majeure which give rise to any such failure or delay on its part, it
shall forthwith notify the Contractor within one (1) working day and shall
inform the Contractor of the period which it is estimated that such failure
or delay shall continue.

delay by the Contractor in performing, its obligations under this Codified

damage which would otherwise have been excluded such liability shall be subject to

POCL and the Contractor shall use all reasonable endeavours to resolve outstanding
agreements to agree by 20th December, 1999.

The Contractor shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing any of its

agreements to agree for so long as such failure to resolve continues.

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that POCL shall not be liable to
indemnify or otherwise compensate the Contractor for any additional costs,
expenses, losses or damages incurred directly or indirectly as a result of the failure
