PLANNING
Plan
Version 7.0 of the High Level plan is being reported against at the detailed level within the
Pathway teams. Exception to the plan will be reported to the checkpoint as they are identified.
There are no exceptions to report this period.
Work continues to detail the plans for New Release 2+, however completion of the plans will
require the agreement to the testing strategy, currently being discussed.

TECHNICAL & SECURITY TESTING

General

Progress with PinICL clearance and regression testing has continued. The focus now is
changing to planning and preparation for testing of the LT2 sofiware set.

Performance
The closure report for tranche 3 of Performance testing has been issued at draft version 0.2
for comment. As a result of tests on Backup and restore a set of recommendations have been
put forward to improve the process and procedures in this area. Whilst a series of targeted
tests are being run currently to clear PinICLs planning for tranche 4 testing has commenced.

Security

Target testing of PinICLs in the LT! software set has continued, with only two now still to
complete testing.

Technical Integrity & Networking

Counter recovery testing (CP1541) has continued successfully. The current test phase statistics
show 279 tests passed and 4 failed.

Systems Management
Additional counter resilience tests have been run confirming confidence in this area. The

Tivoli rig has been rebuilt without any significant problems being encountered. This work
has been substantially made easier by the current versions of the automated scripts used.

MULTI BENEFIT TESTING WITH CAPS

This has continued to progress and is due to complete 28" April. The level of data has
reduced recently and CAPS intend to re-visit contents prior to a re-start for cycle 2 in June.

CAPS 3.5

This continues without issue within the Pathway domain. This may complete this week,
depending on daily progress.

HFSO Training

The six HFSO courses were successfully held concurrently in the Bristol area during the week
12" - 16" April. The feedback from the delegates was very positive.

One issue that arose was that the HFSO’s felt that they would benefit from extra training on
office balancing. This was discussed in a meeting held with POCL/ICL Pathway and ICL
Training Services on 15" April. The resolution is that ICL Training Services will concentrate
more on balancing during the Counter Managers Course which the delegates attend prior to the
HFSO Course. POCL have agreed to submit a change request (CR). This is awaited.

User Training

User Training commenced as scheduled on 6/4/99.

6 ACCEPTANCE PREPARATION & TESTING

6.1

6.2

6.3

Acceptance Specifications

Pathway has raised CCN 456 to make a number of single-key Requirements double-key.
This is expected to facilitate POCL agreement to the BES Acceptance Specification.

The Service Boundaries Acceptance Specification will be revised, inter alia, to reference
three one-day measurement sessions during Live Trial, and revisions to the Service Review
Pack presentation. It is anticipated this will be sufficient to permit agreement to this
specification.

Acceptance Trials

Trials closure reports have now been issued for all of BPS, APS, OBCS, Reference Data,
Security, BES, EPOSS and Audit. Only that for POCL Infrastructure remains to be issued.

A BIT regression cycle commenced on 17" April and has continued without any significant
issue.

Acceptance Reviews
Some 40 review packs, out of a projected total of around 59, have now been issued.
The performance testing for New Release 2 has now completed. The one remaining area of

NR2 testing is MIS regression. This is in progress utilising live CCS Standing Data and
Reference Data, and is expected to complete around 15/5.

REFERENCE DATA

Live Reference Data

The need to implement change for the 2™ class stamp and associated reference data changes

has been the subject of concern over the past 10 days. Pathway believes that the timing of

changes needs to be carefully considered in the future,
Type ‘B’ Interface for NRO

The new AIS drafted by POCL was handed to ICL Pathway for review Thursday 22nd April
1999, Comments will be returned w/e 29" April.

POCL business rules have not been included in the AIS. These were to have been submitted
via a separate document/CR 23rd April, but this is overdue.

NATIONAL ROLL OUT PREPARATION

Customer Education

No Progress. This will remain ‘No Progress’ until the review completes, and full benefit roll-
out details are agreed.

An Implementation Working Group (TWG) meeting was held on Tuesday 20th April, in
Durham. The agenda's main focus was that of Customer Education plan and the CAPS card
enablement plan. At the IWG working level the CAPS representatives gave every indication
that they were working to achieve a successful implementation of card based benefit
payment, with their multi-benefit pilot starting in September 99 and the start of the Multi-
Benefit rollout in March 2000. They, like both POCL and Pathway, are very keen on a
decision being made as soon as possible. The meeting also received a presentation on the
status of the Customer Education plan. This was very positive and now awaits Ministerial
approval to go ahead.

Implementation

Live Trial Preparations (New 103 outlets)

Infrastructure

The preparations for the 103 live trial offices have now been completed. The one office
requiring REB connection (Finlay Road) was scheduled for 23" March 1999 has still not
been completed. The REB visited site but could not get access. WT have now visited site and
agreed between the outlet manager and the manager of the adjacent store that the REB can
have the necessary access on the 28"" April. The REB has confirmed this date.

The inspectorate service has now started on the 103 outlets.

Installation
Appointments for Horizon system installation have now been made with all outlets.

ISDN Installation
The installation of ISDN circuits has now commenced.

Rehearsals
Discussions regarding availability of back end systems to enable an ECCO rehearsal on 1*
May are ongoing.

Live Trial Preparations (Existing 204 outlets)

Infrastructure
All modifications are now complete and all identified snagging has been completed.

Installation

Live Ic to R2 Post Office migration continues. As at close 23rd April, 75 Post Offices have
been successfully migrated and only 4 have been re-scheduled due to different, non system
issues which prevented Pathway from even starting migration, for example a bereavement in
the Post Masters family.

On 21°/22™ April, 26 Post Offices produced their Cash Accounts. All balanced, some with
discrepancies. All discrepancies have been accounted for (e.g. incorrectly migrated figures).

The number of outlets in the programme has reduced from 204 to 200. The following outlets
have been removed:

¢ West Duddo (trolley)

¢ — Chatton
e Greenway
¢ = Thropton

Alvington and Tutnalls have relocated and will remain in the programme.

Infrastructure Programme

Current preparation completions in one working day are running at 80%. WTple are
continuing to experience some difficulties with materials supply which is being addressed.

The disruption document is now agreed and therefore revised counter modification cost
thresholds will be implemented. This will increase the number of offices available for prep
and thus RFI.

A large number of offices are still being suspended by POCL, largely due to re-furbishments
and resignations. This is having a detrimental effect on the beat rate and we are currently
approximately 5 weeks behind schedule against the infrastructure programme plan. This issue
has been escalated within POCL monitoring of this is now undertaken at the Infrastructure

necessary.

STATUS I It is intended to migrate Morpeth and Keynsham offices with the

aim of gaining experience in small numbers of ECCO offices,

during the rehearsal.
