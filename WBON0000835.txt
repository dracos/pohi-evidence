All,

I believe the attached is the e-mail chain referred to by Steve Darlington. In terms of transaction
corrections/acknowledgements we have explained these in the factfile so it should be clear that these need the branch
to accept the TC/TA on the Horizon system as it doesn’t automatically make any adjustments. It is the statement below
that does in my view require further explanation. Rod — do we already have this explanation logged somewhere? Andy
Winn infers that we have used this in court at some time?

“Fujitsu have the ability to impact branch records via the message store but have extremely rigorous procedures in
place to prevent adjustments being made without prior authorisation - within POL and Fujitsu These controls form

the core of our court defence if we get to that stage.”

Please see below. Not yet decided about whether to postpone this week's WG call but does anyone know anything
about the email being quoted below about remote alteration of figures in branch? I think that this is a new one on
me.

Dear Ron,

As Priti has stated in her last sentence we are seeking a stay on the time limits on all cases under review due to the
implications of POL’s non-disclosure of system-generated transactions and Horizon’s integrity issues.

The ‘Helen Rose Report’ is of critical significance to all cases. The information contained within it is a compelling
case for such a stay in its own right. When combined with the Andy Winn/Alan Lusher email in the case of Ward
which explicitly states that Fujitsu can remotely change the figures in the branches without the SPMs’ knowledge
or authority, the case for a general stay is overwhelming.

We ask that the Working Party considers this request as a matter of urgency In order that we do not prejudice our
clients’ cases by omitting what is clearly information of the utmost general significance,.

We also request that the Working Party demands that POL acts quickly to provide the information requested in
Priti’s email immediately so that the mediation process is not hindered further.

Regards
