V'll integrate these points with the changes I’m making

I also shared his confusion re timing — at one point the notes suggest the review needs to report before summer
recess, but then goes on to say that 2™ sight say they can complete by October. What date are we proposing to
accept?

thanks

Hi Alwen

I've had a look, see attached. I am confused as to whether we are agreeing to the second sight view that they need until end of
October for the full review where they can, or whether we are being firmer and saying they finish after the three cases. Can you
clarify?

Suggest you send to Martin Edwarda as well before Paula. I have added various bits here and sorry they are not in tracking - on
the iPad.

Thope your day hasn't been too grim.

Best wishes
Mark
