1. Description of Change Proposed:

The purpose of this CP is to reconstruct the broken Audit Trail using a NON-Live rig and subsequently store it
in the Audit archive.

The outline of tasks required to achieve this together with an indication of the unit expected to impact each task
are :-

(1) Produce an overall technical plan for the data recovery expanding on the steps identified below.
(IPDU/Audit Design)

(2) Identify suitable ‘test rig’ hardware to perform the recovery. The hardware requirements are :-
An Audit Server with autochanger and circa 40GB of filestore.
A correspondence server with sufficient space for an 18GB Riposte message store and 20GB space on
D: drive for Audit data
Note : For a CS Security resource to actually carry out the recovery work this rig needs to be sited at
Feltham) (PTU & IPDU)

(3) Build & configure the rig to a LIVE baseline with settings as detailed in the technical plan ensuring that
legato savesets and Audit tape identities will NOT conflict with the live system (to ensure that data can be
transferred back to the LIVE system).  (PTU/SPTS)

(4) Change the LIVE Audit configuration file to introduce new ‘special’ audit subpoints to enable
identification of this data. (IPDU/Audit Dev)
(5) Scan ALL 9 identified messagestore backup tapes to produce Legato index. — (CS/Security)

(6) For each of the 8 drive backups for each of the four clusters (i.e 32 times)
Amend registry setting for the Audit Agent & configuration settings for Audit Server
Restore a saveset
Amend setting for Audit Agent to Audit complete messagestore
Run the Audit Agent on Correspondence server to produce Audit Data
Run Audit Gatherer , Sealer , Hoarder & Deleter to create an Audit Trail (CS/Security)

(7) Clone ALL Audit tapes produced in step 6. (IPDU/Audit Team)

(8) Extract the seals produced and copy to CD for delivery to live (2 copies). (IPDU/Audit Team)

(9) Deliver the Audit tapes to Bootle & Wigan by secure means. (CS/Security)
(10)Scan the Audit tapes at each site to produce the Audit Trail.  (ISD/NT)
(11) Introduce the seals to the Bootle & Wigan seal databases. (IPDU/Audit )

Verify Validity & Accessibility of data in Live Audit Trail. _(CS/Security & IPDU/Audit)

2. Reason for Change:

There is a TOTAL break in the TMS Audit trail for the period 8" — 14 August 2000 due to defective &
missing tapes at Bootle & Wigan respectively.

This constitutes a contractual breach which is compounded by PON requesting two data retrievals which
encompass this period.

It has been established that there is a possibility of reconstructing the Audit Data for this period by utilising
some old messagestore backup tapes.

The required tapes have been identified and secured from possible deletion as the data has passed its normal
retention date.

3. Consequences if Not Approved:
Pathway remain Contractually Non-Compliant in the provision of the Audit Trail

Pathway are unable to satisfy PON Audit RFINO’s 8 & 47
