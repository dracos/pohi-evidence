RE: Horizon

We're still in the situation where we can't be definitive on timescales. We haven't dictated timescales for the review
on the position that Second Sight should operate outside of control of the Post Office. The slow pace at which cases
have come through means that it is difficult to estimate a completion date at this point.

Hope this helps - I can touch base by phone next week.

Thanks

I understand you are in Brighton for part of next week but just wanted to follow up on a voicemail
message I left for you yesterday. Jo has asked for note on the Horizon/JFSA/Arbuthnot/Forensic
Accountants review which I need to get into the box for noon next Thu.

I have most of what I need but think I should try to give at least an indicative timescale for forensic
review results/outcomes. Are we talking ‘later in the autumn' ?
