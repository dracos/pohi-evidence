POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FOURTH CORPORATE STATEMENT OF FUJITSU SERVICES LIMITED

I, MR WILLIAM PAUL PATTERSON (known as Paul Patterson), will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. I am a director of Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”) and am duly authorised to
make this statement on its behalf. I make this statement in response to the Inquiry’s
Rule 9 Request, dated 31 August 2023, for a corporate statement addressing
issues relevant to Phases 6 and 7 of the Inquiry (the “Request’). In particular, the
Request focuses on the following matters from 1999 to the present day (the

“Relevant Period’):

a. the identification, investigation, recording, reporting and rectification of (i)
bugs, errors and defects (“BEDs’), (ii) other network and system failures or
(iii) the impact of such events upon branch accounts (“Incident Management

Obligations”); and

Page 1 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

b. the use of privileged access by Fujitsu employees to remedy errors in
transaction data and branch accounts (“Privileged Access” and the

“Privileged Access Obligations”),

(together, the “Relevant Obligations’).

As noted in the First, Second and Third Corporate Statements dated 28 September
2022, 29 December 2022 and 14 September 2023 respectively (collectively the
“Previous Corporate Statements”, individually the “First/Second/Third
Corporate Statement”, respectively), I do not have first-hand knowledge of many
of the matters which are set out in this corporate statement. For this reason, I wish
to reiterate at the outset how the information in this statement has been compiled.
As with the responses in the Previous Corporate Statements, responses to
questions set out in this statement are generally drawn from documentary sources.
For the purposes of preparing this statement, I have been assisted by a team of
individuals within Fujitsu and Morrison Foerster. This is due to the vast amount of
documentation and sources of evidence which have had to be reviewed for a
period stretching over 25 years. This team has provided me with the documents
which are referenced in this statement and exhibited in accordance with the index
at the back of this statement, and which are the principal source of my knowledge
of this statement’s content. I have also been directed to the key parts of the Horizon

IT System (“Horizon”) contract over time, as described in this statement.

Page 2 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

Further, as noted in the Previous Corporate Statements, I do not have a detailed

technical knowledge of Horizon and I am reliant upon Fujitsu staff with relevant

technical expertise and knowledge of such matters.

The responses provided in this fourth corporate statement represent Fujitsu’s

current understanding of the information available. Given that work in relation to

Phases 6 and 7 of the Inquiry is ongoing, it may be that Fujitsu will need to

supplement this corporate statement as further material is identified. For ease of

reference, set out in the table below are the relevant sections of this corporate

statement and the relevant paragraphs:

For ease of reference, in this statement:

ICL Pathway Limited (which initially managed the Horizon contract, and later
novated the contract to Fujitsu Services Limited) and Fujitsu Services Limited

will be referred to collectively as “Fujitsu”; and

Post Office Counters Limited (subsequently Post Office Limited) will be

referred to collectively as “POL”).

Further, references to Horizon in this statement shall be as follows:

a. Pathway Programme: The solution designed and developed between 1996

and 1999 further to a tripartite arrangement between Fujitsu, POL and the
Department of Health and Social Security (the “DSS”), and as discussed in

detail in the First Corporate Statement.

b. Legacy Horizon: The original iteration of Horizon which was in operation
from 1999 to 2010 and which used Riposte software from Escher, a third-
party specialist provider to post offices in other countries, to replicate data
between counters at the branches and correspondence servers in the data

centres.!

c. Horizon Online: Comprising both (i) HNG-X, which was rolled out to the
majority of Post Office branches by 31 August 2010, and (ii) HNG-A, which

was progressively rolled out to branches from 2016. HNG-X was a

WITN06650400

replacement of the Legacy Horizon system. The core technical change of
HNG-X was the replacement of the Riposte system with a system of direct
transmission from the counter to the data centre. The development of HNG-
A was driven by the need to replace ageing Windows NT 4 branch counter

technology with a Windows 10 operating system.”

BACKGROUND TO FUJITSU’S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

As part of the Request, the Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to provide an explanation as
to (i) the contractual obligations in place during the Relevant Period which relate
to the Relevant Obligations, (ii) the measures put in place to address those
contractual obligations, and (iii) the measures in place to monitor Fujitsu’s
compliance with those contractual obligations. The Inquiry has also sought details
of how these measures have changed following the Horizon Issues Judgment
handed down by Justice Fraser in the Bates v POL group litigation on

16 December 2019.°

The main document governing the contractual relationship between POL and
Fujitsu (as they are now known) is the Horizon contract. It is a single contract which
has been varied substantially over time. References below in this corporate
statement to phases of the Horizon contract's operation and the different names
which have been used for that contract in different periods of its operation have

been used for convenience only. In addition to the Horizon contract, the contractual

3 [2019] EWHC 3408 (QB)

Page 5 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

relationship between POL and Fujitsu is also governed by a number of ancillary

documents, most notably:

a. Change Control Notes (each_a “CCN”): CCNs are the contractually

mandated? format of agreed variations to the Horizon contract. The definition
of new or withdrawn services is therefore managed through CCNs. A CCN is
authorised and has effect when it is approved and signed by authorised

representatives from both Fujitsu and POL.

b. Contract Controlled Documents (each a “CCD”): CCDs are documents which

are referred to in the Horizon contract. CCDs are often used to provide
detailed technical specification. The Horizon contract permitted Fujitsu and
POL to introduce or amend CCDs by using the Change Control Procedure

(i.e., by an agreed CCN).

9. There have been 23 conformed® major versions of the Horizon contract during the
Relevant Period. For convenience, this corporate statement examines the

Relevant Obligations across three broad phases of contract operation, as follows:

a. The codified agreement, effective from 28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002

(the “Codified Agreement’), which was agreed between POL and Fujitsu

4 The relevant schedule governing how changes and amendments are made to the Horizon contract has
changed over time. In the Codified Agreement dated 28 July 1999 the relevant schedule is Schedule A05.
In the latest conformed major version of the Horizon contract (version 14.0) approved on 20 December
2021 the relevant schedule is Schedule A3

5 In Fujitsu's business it is common for it and its customers to create conformed versions of long-term
contracts. The purpose of conformance is to update the contract to reflect all or some of the variations
agreed to that contract. Each conformed version of the Horizon contract summarises in the version history
table at the outset of the document which agreed variations have been conformed into that version

Page 6 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

following the withdrawal of the DSS from the Pathway Programme in
May 1999.° As described in paragraphs 64 to 89 of the First Corporate
Statement, prior to this date, pilot releases of the Pathway Programme had
already been rolled out to around 200 branches, and preparation for national
rollout was in progress and subject to the completion of a contractual
acceptance process. The Codified Agreement was unusual in so far as it was
concluded part way through the development and testing stages of the
Systems Development Life Cycle ("SDLC”)’ of a system which had been
procured, designed and partially developed under a prior contract between
the parties.® In consequence, a number of the provisions of that earlier
contract were carried across into the Codified Agreement and provisions
were added to address the partial delivery of that system at the time of

contracting.

b. IThe Codified Agreement was amended on 31 December 2002 by CCN 1100
amongst other things to introduce a network banking application that was to
support the transaction of certain banking business in branches,® such as
cash deposits and withdrawals.'° There are seven major conformed versions
of the Horizon contract dating from 31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006,

each of which are substantially in the same format (together, the “Varied and

Restated Agreements”) and which are structured, presentationally at least,

quite differently to the Codified Agreement."'

c. CCN 1200,'? submitted on 23 August 2006, introduced certain variations to
the Horizon contract including changes to address the design, development,
testing and deployment of a new system, HNG-X, and the continued
maintenance of Legacy Horizon pending the migration of Post Office
branches to HNG-X. At the time of preparing this corporate statement, there
have been 15 major conformed versions of the Horizon contract since 31
August 2006, the final version of which was agreed between the parties
shortly before the submission of this corporate statement.'? Each of these 15
conformed versions (together, the “HNG-X Agreements’) are substantially
in the same format as one another.'4 This phase includes the subsequent
introduction of HNG-A. The development and delivery of HNG-A was

introduced pursuant to CCN 1600, submitted on 22 February 20161 and later

10. The Horizon contract in each of these three phases contains provisions to address
the different stages of the SDLC. I refer to paragraph 3.7.2 of the Expert Witness
Report of Charles Cipione dated 14 September 2022 which contains a summary
of the various commonly used stages of the SDLC, being Planning, Analysis,
Design, Development, Testing, Deployment and Maintenance. Both Legacy
Horizon and Horizon Online were developed using the first four stages of the SDLC
before they were formally accepted into live service (Maintenance) following
Testing and Deployment. The majority of the Relevant Period concerns the
Maintenance stage of each system. The contractual and operational regimes for
managing BEDs in Horizon are different as between the Maintenance stage and
the prior stages. This statement is focussed on the contractual and operational

regimes for managing BEDs during the Maintenance stage of each system.

11. This corporate statement first addresses the Incident Management Obligations
within each of the three contractual phases (see paragraphs 12 to 170 below). It
then addresses the Privileged Access Obligations contained within each of these
three phases (see paragraphs 171 to 207 below). As requested by the Inquiry, a
summary of the measures that were put in place to address the Incident
Management and Privileged Access Obligations is also provided in each of these

two sections.

THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT OBLIGATIONS

12. For context, prior to the Maintenance stage of Horizon, there would have been
obligations and processes in place during the Development and Testing stages of
the SDLC to identify, investigate and resolve BEDs in new software prior to its
acceptance into live service and subsequent Deployment. However, as Mr Charles
Cipione noted in paragraph 3.7.2(g) of his Report, not all BEDs in the software can
be identified during Testing. Further, certain known BEDs may be accepted into
live service either with a workaround in place, or with the intention to develop a fix
in due course. For example, the release note for Core Service Release+ (“CSR+’),
which was rolled out to branches during the national rollout, sets out at Appendix
B the “Outstanding Issues’ to be resolved either (i) during the live pilot, (ii) through
the application of a resolution plan, or (iii) for “low impact’ issues, as part of a

maintenance release.'”

13. I The Relevant Obligations summarised below primarily relate to the performance

of “Operational Services” during the Maintenance stage of the Horizon system.

The Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)1®

14. Pursuant to clause 106.3 (General Principles), the POCL Services and the POCL
Infrastructure was to be provided in accordance with, and comply with, all relevant

applicable industry standards, as listed in Schedule A2.

15. Under clause 201.2, Fujitsu was responsible, subject to certain qualifications, for
meeting POL’s requirements specified in Schedule A15 of the Codified Agreement,
in accordance with the ‘Solutions’ specified in Schedule A16 by performing the
‘Core System Services’ (i.e., those services specified in clause 201.3). Clause
201.2 goes on to clarify, however, that POL’s acceptance of the ‘Solutions’ in
Schedule A16 “shall not relieve [Fujitsu] of its obligation to meet such of those

requirements specified in Schedule A15...”.

16. In accordance with clause 201.3, Fujitsu was required to perform the ‘Core System
Services’ in accordance with all applicable provisions. The applicable provisions in
respect of the ‘Core System Services’ were set out in clause 405 under the heading
‘Performance of Operational Services’ and included the ‘POCL Infrastructure
Services’. In the context of the Codified Agreement, many of the contractual
obligations with which this corporate statement is concerned arose in connection
with the POCL Infrastructure Services. These services are then defined in more

detailed in Schedule G01 (POCL Infrastructure Service Definition).

18 Defined terms contained within this section that are not defined within this corporate statement take the
meanings given to them in the Codified Agreement

Page 11 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

17. An explanation of the Core System Services (or “Operational Services”) which
Fujitsu considers most applicable to the Incident Management Obligations is set
out at paragraphs 33 to 140 of this corporate statement. This explanation includes
a summary of the relevant contractual provisions in respect of each of these

Operational Services.

18. Under clause 702, in relation to the performance of POCL Services (defined as the
“Core System Services and all other obligations of [Fujitsu] under this Codified

Agreement’),'9 Fujitsu warranted and represented that (amongst other things):

a. “[t]he POCL Services shall be supplied and rendered by appropriately
experienced, qualified and trained personnel with all due skill, care and

diligence” (clause 702.1);

b. Obligations under the Codified Agreement would be discharged with “all due
skill, care and diligence including but not limited to good industry practice
and...in accordance with the best of its own established internal procedures”

(clause 702.2); and

c. “the POCL Services shall be performed in such a way as to cause minimum
disruption to the business of [POL] and the End Users [i.e. postmasters]”

(clause 702.8).

19. Under clause 703, in relation to the performance of Products (defined as including

the “Core System Products and any Optional Products and Additional Products

18 Codified Agreement, Schedule A01, FUJ00000071
Page 12 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

and any [POL] Consumables”),?° Fujitsu warranted and represented that (amongst
other things) “...a// components of the POCL Service Infrastructure shall operate

in accordance with their respective specifications...” (clause 703.2).

20. Under clause 705, in relation to Technical Standards, Fujitsu warranted and
represented that (amongst other things) “the POCL Services shall comply with,
and be provided in accordance with, the policies and standards specified in
Schedule A2 and all components and equipment used in the course of the
provision of the POCL Services shall operate in accordance with their technical

specifications” (clause 705.1).

21. The Codified Agreement contains provisions regarding the Acceptance of the
system following Testing and Live Trials prior to its national rollout to Post Office
branches. Out of these stages, three supplemental agreements to the Codified
Agreement were agreed between Fujitsu and POL on 20 August 1999,
24 September 1999 and 19 January 2000, respectively (collectively, the
“Supplemental Agreements’, individually the  “First/Second/Third

Supplemental Agreement’, respectively).

22. The Supplemental Agreements are described in more detail in paragraphs 124 to
140 of the First Corporate Statement. At the request of the Inquiry, those
descriptions are not repeated in this corporate statement; however, I note in

particular that:

20 Codified Agreement, Schedule A01, FUJ00000071
Page 13 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

a. Amongst the Acceptance Incidents described in Part B of Schedule 1 to the
Second Supplemental Agreement were (i) Al 376, which led to the
introduction of the “TIP Integrity Checking Period”, and (ii) Al 408, which
related to the performance of the Service Desk Service. For further detail on
the Acceptance Incidents addressed by the Second Supplemental
Agreement and their rectification plans, see paragraphs 126 to 133 and

Appendix 2 of the First Corporate Statement.

b. At the time of the Second Supplemental Agreement, CCN 562 was issued.?'
CCN 562 amended Schedule G01 of the Codified Agreement, by adding a
new paragraph 3.6 which addressed, amongst other things, data errors and
discrepancies and how the same were reported to POL. CCN 562 also
amended the resolution plan for Al 376 set out in Schedule 2 to the Second

Supplemental Agreement.

c. The Third Supplemental Agreement amended the Codified Agreement and
introduced, amongst other things, further changes to Helpdesk and to the
reconciliation and integrity control processes. As noted in paragraph 134 of
the First Corporate Statement, the Third Supplemental Agreement required
that, amongst other things, POL and Fujitsu continue co-operating in order
to, (i) comply with obligations in relation to the Service Desk Service, (ii)
develop operational procedures to support the accounting integrity control

over the TIP interface, (iii) introduce new and detailed processes in relation

21 FUJ00000496, dated 28 July 1999
Page 14 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

to TIP data transfer rules, and (iv) improve end to end management of
Reference Data over the Core System. Further detail on the provisions of the
Third Supplemental Agreement is set out in paragraphs 134 to 140 of the

First Corporate Statement.

Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)

23. As noted above, when introducing the Network Banking solution to the Horizon
system, in 2002 the format of the Horizon contract was restructured and amended
by CCN 1100. It became, with effect from 31 December 2002, the Varied and

Restated Agreement.

24. Under the Varied and Restated Agreements, as with the Codified Agreement,
many of the Incident Management Obligations arose in connection with the

performance of Operational Services by Fujitsu.

25. In accordance with clause 1 (Performance of Services), Fujitsu was required to
perform specified services, including, of most relevance, Operational Services “in
accordance with all applicable provisions hereof’ (clause 1.1.1). Schedule 19 set
out the Operational Services that were to be performed by Fujitsu. Many of them
corresponded with the Operational Services specified in the Codified Agreement

phase.

26. A table of the Operational Services then in place was set out in Schedule 19 of the
Varied and Restated Agreements along with (i) a brief description of each of those

services, and (ii) the CCDs that contain the service description for each of the

Page 15 of 218
27.

WITN06650400
WITN06650400

Operational Services that were to be performed. An explanation of the Operational
Services which Fujitsu considers most applicable to the Incident Management
Obligations is set out at paragraphs 33 to 140 of this corporate statement. This
explanation includes a summary of the relevant contractual provisions in respect

of each of these Operational Services.

In addition to the obligations in relation to the specific Operational Services
described above, Fujitsu gave a number of general undertakings in the Varied and

Restated Agreements. Amongst other things, Fujitsu undertook:

a. _ that the Services (including the Operational Services, amongst others) would
comply with, and be provided in accordance with, the policies and standards
specified in Schedule 2 and “all components and equipment used in the
course of the provision of the Services shall operate in accordance with their

technical specifications” (clause 9.1.1);

b. to “discharge its obligations under this Agreement with all due skill, care and
diligence, including but not limited to good industry practice and... in
accordance with the best of its own established internal procedures’ (clause

9.2.2);

c. _ to “provide the Operational Services using the Applications functioning on the

Horizon Service Infrastructure” (see clause 9.2.5);

Page 16 of 218
28.

29.

WITN06650400
WITN06650400

d. that “the interfaces to all external systems connected to the Horizon Service
Infrastructure shall operate in accordance with the applicable AIS and TIS”

(clause 9.2.6);

e. to perform the Services “in such a way as to cause a minimum of disruption

to the business of Post Office and the End Users” (clause 9.2.7); and

f. that “...all components of the Horizon Service Infrastructure shall operate in
accordance with their respective specifications, except that, for the avoidance
of doubt, it is agreed that Post Office shall have no remedy for breach of this
undertaking in relation to errors or interruptions to Services which cause a

failure of a SLT or an ARL” (clause 9.3.1).

Schedule 17 (Infrastructure) provided an overview of the Horizon Service
Infrastructure and the Infrastructure Services that Fujitsu was required to provide
to POL in order to deliver the Applications and thereby provide the Services (see

paragraph 1.1).

Schedule 18 (Application Management) recorded and specified the Applications
used by Fujitsu to provide the Services to POL. Pursuant to clause 1.2 of
Schedule 18, Fujitsu was required to operate and maintain each Application listed
therein in accordance with the relevant specifications for each Application, all

relevant CCDs and all relevant Service Levels.

HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)

30. As noted above, the Horizon contract was restructured to address the
Development, Testing and Deployment of HNG-X and the Maintenance of Legacy
Horizon while the Deployment of HNG-X took place. Version 1.0 of the HNG-X
Agreements was effective from 31 August 2006. Whilst it has been amended from
time to time, the structure has remained substantially the same across the 15 major

conformed versions of the Horizon contract relevant to HNG-X.

31. I Under clause 15 of the HNG-X Agreements (Service Standards), Fujitsu undertook

that (amongst other things):

a. “the Services, the HNG-X Development and the Associated Change
Development shall comply with, and be provided in accordance with, the
policies and standards specified in Schedule A4 and all components and
equipment used in the course of the provision of the Services shall operate

in accordance with their technical specifications” (clause 15.1.1);

b. “the Infrastructure, the PostShop Infrastructure, the Horizon Applications, the
Business Capabilities and the Support Facilities shall be provided in
accordance with and comply with all relevant applicable industry standards,

as these standards are listed in Schedule A4” (clause 15.1.3);72

22 In v 7.0 of the HNG-X Agreements dated 10 May 2010, the reference to ‘PostShop Infrastructure’ is
amended to ‘Superstock Infrastructure’. In v 12.0 of the HNG-X Agreements dated 3 July 2017, reference
to ‘Superstock Infrastructure’ was removed from this clause

Page 18 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

c. “the Services, the HNG-X Development and the Associated Change
Development shall be supplied and rendered by appropriately experienced,
qualified and trained personnel with all due skill, care and diligence” (clause

15.1.4);

d. Fujitsu would discharge its obligations under the HNG-X Agreements with “a//
due skill, care and diligence including but not limited to good industry practice
and... in accordance with the best of its own established internal procedures”

(clause 15.1.5); and

e. “the Services shall be performed in such a way as to cause a minimum of
disruption to the business of Post Office and the End Users [i.e. postmasters]”

(clause 15.1.8).

32. Table A of Schedule B3.1 of the HNG-X Agreements contained the Operational
Services to be delivered by Fujitsu and included (i) a brief description of each of
those services, (ii) the initial CCDs that contain the service description for each of
the services that were performed for Legacy Horizon, and (iii) the new CCDs due
to come into force for each service to be performed for HNG-X following a specified

“Trigger Event”.

34. In addition to the Operational Services listed above, I understand that there are

other Operational Services which are also relevant to the Incident Management

Obligations but to a lesser degree. These include the Branch Network Service?*

23 Although Fourth Line of Support was classified as a ‘Development Service’ in the Codified Agreement
and Varied and Restated Agreements, it is convenient to deal with it under the heading Operational

Services, together with the other relevant services

and the Central Network Service.”5 The relevant Incident Management Obligations

for these services and associated CCDs are footnoted to this paragraph.
Service Desk Service

35. I The Service Desk, which was also known at various times as the Horizon Systems
Helpdesk (HSH) or Horizon Service Desk (HSD) (the “Service Desk”), was first
established in May 1996 as part of the Pathway Programme as an initial point of
contact for postmasters in need of support. The service continued from May 1999
under the various versions of the Horizon contract described above until POL
introduced a towers model following which, on or around 2 July 2014, the Service

Desk Service was transferred to a third-party provider, Atos.7°
Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)

36. I Under Schedule A01 of the Codified Agreement, the Service Desk was defined as
“[t]he initial point of call for Users in need of support relating to the POCL Services”.
The relevant Requirements for the Service Desk Service were Requirements 521
to 529 and 914, which were set out in Schedule A15. The corresponding sections
of Schedule A16 contained Fujitsu’s ‘Solutions’ and POL’s comments on those

solutions. Pursuant to clause 201.2 of the Codified Agreement, Fujitsu was

responsible (subject to certain qualifications) for meeting the Requirements
specified in Schedule A15 in accordance with the ‘Solutions’ specified in Schedule
A16 by performing the Core System Services (i.e., those services specified in
clause 201.3, as described above). These Requirements and Solutions stated,

amongst other things, that:

a. Fujitsu was required to “provide one telephone number as a single point of
access to all Help Desk Services” (Requirement 521, Schedule A15).
Fujitsu’s Solution noted that “[Fujitsu] intends that the Horizon System
Helpdesk will be provided with a single telephone number’ (Reference 521,

Schedule A16).

b. — Fujitsu’s “support services will provide all appropriate support necessary to
ensure the continuous and efficient operation of the POCL Infrastructure

Service at all times from day 1” (Reference 523, Schedule A16).

c. The Service Desk would “deal with all calls relating to the operation,
configuration and end-user [postmaster] support of counter terminal
equipment, their operating systems software, application software and
processes”. Requests for support would be “categorised according to type
such as hardware, software, network, advice & guidance, configuration, etc”.
The Service Desk would provide “problem and fault diagnosis and [would]
control any necessary hardware or software maintenance activities”

(Reference 524, Schedule A16).

Page 22 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

d. The Service Desk would be “staffed by fully trained, qualified and
experienced personnel operating according to agreed procedures and within

agreed service performance levels” (Reference 527, Schedule A16).

e. Fujitsu’s Solution to Requirement 914 documented the “key service
characteristics” of the Service Desk Service. These included the three levels
of service: (i) Level 1 calls were described as “those which were relatively
simple and straightforward to explain and diagnose and which can be fully
resolved in less than 10 minutes” (paragraph 2.2.1), (ii) Level 2 calls were
“generally more complex problems and potential faults” which would typically
“take less than 30 minutes to resolve but in extreme cases may take longer,
up to 45 mins” (paragraphs 2.3.1 and 2.3.3), and (iii) Level 3 service was
invoked when the call could not be “fully resolved wholly’ within Service Desk
but required “escalation either to a higher level of technical support or to an
engineer to perform a maintenance visit’. In practice, the Software Support
Centre team (“SSC”) provided Third Line Support. The key service
requirements also covered hours of service (paragraph 2.5), problem
management (paragraph 2.6), resilience (paragraph 2.8), training (paragraph
2.9), personnel (paragraph 2.10), service targets (paragraph 2.11), and

service monitoring (paragraph 3).

37. I Under Schedule A08, ICL Sorbus Limited (“ICL Sorbus”), a Fujitsu subsidiary, was
listed as being the subcontractor responsible for the “Operation of Horizon System
Help Desk and Service Management Centre.” References to ICL Sorbus were

removed from the Varied and Restated Agreements.

Page 23 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

As explained above, the relevant Core System Services were the Operational
Services pursuant to clause 405 and, specifically, the POCL Infrastructure
Services, which were to be provided in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule G01 (POCL Infrastructure Service Definition). The Service Desk is

addressed in section 6 of Schedule G01, which noted by way of example:

a. “The first level Service shall provide an immediate problem solving service
for all simple and straightforward problems, which can be resolved within five

(5) minutes, and all general enquiries” (paragraph 6.3.1.1).

b. “The second level Service shall provide a diagnostics and fixing service for
all problems which cannot be fixed within five (5) minutes by the first level
Service, but which can be resolved within thirty (30) minutes”

(paragraph 6.3.2.1).

c.  “[Fujitsu] shall provide a problem management system to record the problem
details...” (paragraph 6.4.1). Paragraph 6.4 then provides further detail in

relation to how problems were to be recorded.

d. “[Fujitsu] shall, on request, provide on-line access to the problem

management system...” (paragraph 6.9.5).

e.  “[Fujitsu] shall retain Horizon System Helpdesk records for a minimum of

eighteen (18) months” (paragraph 6.9.3).

As explained above, in addition to provisions in the Horizon contract, the

contractual relationship between POL and Fujitsu is also governed by CCDs. In

Page 24 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

this regard, version 4.0 of the Horizon System Help Desk Call Enquiry Matrix (with
internal reference CS/FSP/002, the “Call Enquiry Matrix”) dated 28 July 1999 was

introduced. The Call Enquiry Matrix stated:

a. “The Horizon System Helpdesk provides a the [sic] single contact point for all
technical problems arising within the [Fujitsu] operating domain, from outlets,
[POL] and its clients where there are links into the ICL Pathway systems and

for reconciling data or information across those links as business incidents”.

b. Categories of incident, which included (amongst others) hardware incidents,
software incidents, network incidents, various operation incidents, advice and

guidance, documentation incidents and security incidents.

c. Version 4.0 introduced, for the first time, cash account balance incidents
(under the heading ‘PO Training’). These incidents were described as
relating to “training incidents arising from Wednesday's cash account balance
activities. These incidents typically fall outside the normal 5/10 minute A&G
calls’. The Call Enquiry Matrix explained that “[t]his service is designed to
assist the outlet staff with areas that they are unfamiliar with but are not

considered to be purely advice and guidance”.

The inclusion of cash account balance incidents in the Call Enquiry Matrix at this
time corresponded with the Horizon Live Trial in May 1999, which introduced into
branches, for the first time, cash accounting functionality as part of the EPOSS

service aspect of the Core System Release (there was no cash accounting

Page 25 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

functionality in the pilot releases 1A, 1B and 1C, as described in more detail in

paragraphs 64 to 89 of the First Corporate Statement).2”

41. As explained above, in the months following signature of the Codified Agreement,
the Supplemental Agreements were agreed between POL and Fujitsu. Each of the
Supplemental Agreements included provisions relevant to the operation of the
Service Desk. Further detail in relation to the Supplemental Agreements is set out

in paragraphs 124 to 138 of the First Corporate Statement.

42. Pursuant to paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 of the Third Supplemental Agreement,
Fujitsu and POL entered into an interface agreement to demarcate the
responsibilities between the Helpdesk and the ‘NBSC’, or Network Business
Support Centre. The NBSC was a POL-operated helpline introduced by CCN 441b
raised on 4 October 1999 to “provide [POL] users with additional support for new
and changed business processes during Live Trial’.2® Version 1.0 of the CCD
entitled “[FujitsuJ{POL] Interface Agreement for the NBSC and HSH Interface”
dated 25 February 2000 (with internal reference CS/IFS/007, the “Service Desk
Interface Agreement”) contained a “Responsibility Matrix” that specified which
types of incidents were the responsibility of POL’s Network Business Support
Centre (“NBSC”) and those which were the responsibility of Fujitsu’s Service

Desk.22 Amongst other things, this interface agreement stated that:

27 ICL Pathway Core System Release Contents Description (PA/STR/012), FUJ00078801 (v 1.0 dated 25
June 1999), section 1.4

28 FUJ00000407

29 FUJ00080405

Page 26 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

Service Desk was responsible for “informing NBSC of any known issues or
problems which may cause incidents to be logged or cause an exceptional
increase in call volumes at NBSC” (section 6.2(a)). NBSC was subject to a

corresponding obligation (section 6.1(a)).

Service Desk and NBSC were required to cooperate with each other fully “in
the resolution of complex appropriate incidents. A complex appropriate
incident is defined as “an incident that requires both NBSC and HSH action
to resolve the incident” (section 6.1(i) and section 6.2(i)). They were also
“responsible for accepting and logging undefined incidents’, which the
interface agreement defined as those incidents not listed in the Responsibility

Matrix at section 11 (sections 6.1(j) and 6.2(j)).

If a postmaster needed support when completing their cash account, Service
Desk was the first point of contact. In the first instance, Service Desk was to
assist the postmaster using scripts. If this resulted in a “cash account
discrepancy’, then the Service Desk was responsible for assisting the
postmaster in the correction of the discrepancy. If the Service Desk was
unable to resolve it, the postmaster was to be referred to the NBSC for
approval to accept the discrepancy (Schedule 11, under the heading “needs

support when completing cash account’).

If a postmaster was unable to complete their cash account, the Service Desk

was the first point of contact. Where the cash account could not be

Page 27 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

completed, the Service Desk was to refer the postmaster to the NBSC

(Schedule 11, under the heading “cannot complete cash account’).

e. In relation to EPOSS discrepancies, the Service Desk was responsible for
assisting the postmaster in the correction of the discrepancy. If the Service
Desk was unable to resolve it, the postmaster was to be referred to the NBSC
for approval to accept the discrepancy (Schedule 11, under the headings
“[hjas an EPOSS discrepancy (Daily)’ and “[hjas an EPOSS discrepancy

(Weekly)”).

43. At around the same time, Fujitsu produced version 1.0 of the process document
entitled ‘CSR+ Horizon System Helpdesk Processes and Procedures Description’
(with internal reference CS/PRO/092) dated 11 February 2000. This document was
classified as a Processes and Procedures Description (“PPD”),°° which is said to
have provided “a description of all the processes involved in order to enable the
contractual agreement of operations and to be a source from which authors can
develop any further user documentation needed”.*' In particular, the CSR+

Horizon System Helpdesk PPD noted:

3° By way of background, PPDs were introduced pursuant to Requirement 481 in Schedule A15 of the
Codified Agreement. Fujitsu’s Solution in Schedule A16 stated: ‘[Fujitsu] will provide a set of PPDs that
define the OPS operating procedures for use by staff at post offices. The PPDs will include processes for
transactions, accounting, balancing, stock taking and action to be taken [during an] emergency such as a
system failure. [Fujitsu] will cooperate with [POL] to allow [POL] to include instructions from the PPDs in
the [POL] operations manuals and other operational instructions for Users”.

31 FUJ00080403, this PPD was amended from time to time; See also FUJ00080407 (v 2.0 dated 12
September 2000); FUJ00001498 (v 3.0 dated 12 December 2000), FUJ00001579 (v 4.0 dated 20
September 2001). Significant changes were introduced at the time of FUJO0001761 (v 5.0 dated 25 March
2003); these are dealt with separately below.

Page 28 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

a. By way of overview that the Service Desk provided POL with “a single point
of contact for dealing with all problems relating to the Horizon system
procedures and the Horizon system installed in outlets, and also for OBCS
[Order Book Control Service] fallback encashments. Additionally it provides
a single point of contact for operational issues concerning the Horizon system

from pre-determined sources within [POL]” (section 3); and

b. The types of calls the Service Desk would field, many of which reflected those

described in the Call Enquiry Matrix set out above (section 5).

44. POL had a “business vision of a single point of contact’.*2 The first phase to
support this vision was introduced by CCN 777b raised on 19 July 2001.5° The
details of the change are stated in CCN 777b to have been that POL wished “to
move from two helpdesk telephone numbers to one utilising their NSBC as a SPoC
[single point of contact] utilising a BT Intelligent Call Router (ICR) system to route
the callers to either the HSH or NSBC depending on the time of enquiry, to enable
a seamless operation”. CCN 777b envisaged consequential amendments to the
Codified Agreement (specifically paragraphs 4.3 and 6.12.1 of Schedule G01, and

an amendment to the definition of single point of contact in Schedule A01).

45. In September 2002, Fujitsu proposed to reduce Service Desk calls and service

levels. In its ‘Proposal to Post Office Ltd for Extension of the Horizon Contract’

32 See the discussion in CCN 1016a, FUJ00000875, raised on 29 October 2002
33 FUJ00000684, raised on 19 July 2001

Page 29 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

dated 18 September 2002 (with internal reference BD/PRP/008, the “Fujitsu

Proposal”):*4

a. Fujitsu proposed the introduction of the Technical Service Desk “which will
be responsible for the monitoring and control of all calls relating to Network

Banking, whatever domain the calls come from” (see the Fujitsu Proposal).

b. Fujitsu proposed, amongst other things, that the Service Desk should provide
“[nJo advice and guidance calls (these calls will be taken by the Post Office
Help Desk - only technical support (fault reporting and resource co-
ordination) service will be provided... The effect of these changes, combined
with the implementation of SPOC2 and the implementation of the Technical
Service Desk, will reduce Help Desk Calls..."° The reference to ‘SPOC2’
was to the second phase of POL’s vision of a single point of contact referred

to above.

c. Fujitsu acknowledged that its staff were, at that time, responsible for handling
situations such as, investigating “issues where the financial integrity of the
Horizon system has been put in doubt by end-user claims of lost transactions,
lost stock or cash account misbalance”.*© Fujitsu proposed withdrawing this
service and replacing it with a single Fujitsu Problem Manager who would
liaise with POL central staff; “[t]he shared problem management database

will continue to be updated by the Fujitsu Services Problem Manager but pro-

active problem management by Fujitsu Services at postmaster level will

cease”.97

46. These changes to the Service Desk were introduced, in part, by CCN 1016a in
October 2002, which envisaged consequential amendments to some of the
Schedules to the Codified Agreement, notably Schedules A15, A16, G01, G10 and

NO5.°6

47. Following the introduction of CCN 1016a in October 2002, the scope of the Service
Desk was reduced in material respects. CCN 1016a summarised the changes as

follows:

“Currently the NBSC resolves [POL] business related calls and the HSH
resolves calls surrounding the operation of the Horizon kit and calls relating

to hardware, software and network problems.

The introduction of SPoC 2 would result in the HSH only resolving
hardware, software and network problems, for example “my printer has
broken”, together with any environmental and security issues. The NBSC
would then resolve any calls where outlets require advice or guidance in
using the Horizon system, for example “how do I input bureau transaction
to the system.” These calls are currently categorised as Advice & Guidance,

cash accounting or training’.

37 FUJ00232510 (v 1.0), paragraph 5.3.5
38 FUJ00000875

Page 31 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

48. According to CCN 1016a, under the revised process, when placing a call, the
branch would be directed by the telephony which was in POL’s domain. All advice
and guidance type calls received at any time by the Service Desk would be referred
to the NSBC and logged as “inappropriate” by the Service Desk. The Service Desk

would only provide technical support on system issues.

Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)

49. Asnoted above, clause 1 of the Varied and Restated Agreements required Fujitsu
to perform the Operational Services, “in accordance with all applicable provisions
thereof’. Schedule 19 set out the Operational Services that were to be performed
by Fujitsu, which included (amongst others) the ‘Horizon Systems Help Desk
Service’, defined as, “[t]he provision of first and second line support to Post Office
Branches and other designated groups through the provision of a support desk
function”. The corresponding CCD was the ‘Horizon Systems Helpdesk: Service
Description’ (with internal reference CS/SER/002), which is addressed in more

detail in paragraphs 39 to 49 of the Second Corporate Statement.

50. The reduced scope of the Service Desk was reflected in substantial amendments.
to the CSR+ Horizon System Helpdesk PPD (with internal reference
CS/PRO/092), incorporated into version 5.0, dated 25 March 2003.°9 The ‘Service
Desk Interface Agreement’ (with internal reference CS/IFS/007) was also

amended to reflect the reduced scope of the Service Desk, such that version 4.0,

39 FUJ00001761
Page 32 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

dated 1 July 2003, no longer included cash account in the Responsibility Matrix

(contained in Appendix A).4°

HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)

51. In relation to the HNG-X Agreements, Schedule B3.1 sets out at paragraph 2 a
table listing the Operational Services which Fujitsu was required to perform,
including in row 1 the ‘Service Desk Service’, described as ‘[t]he provision of first
and second line support to Post Office Branches and other designated groups
through the provision of a support desk function” (following the description of the
‘Horizon Systems Help Desk Service’ contained in the Varied and Restated

Agreements.

52. The ‘New CCD’ for the Service Desk was identified as the ‘Service Desk Service:
Service Description’ (with internal reference SVM/SDM/SD/0001), 41 which
replaced the ‘Horizon Systems Helpdesk: Service Description’ (with internal
reference CS/SER/002) when it came into effect at “Trigger Point T2 (Service Desk
Change)”.*2 The content of the ‘Service Desk Service: Service Description’ is
addressed in more detail in paragraphs 39 to 49 of the Second Corporate

Statement.

WITN06650400

53. Pursuant to CCNs 1409 and 1409a, from 2 July 2014, Fujitsu ceased to provide
the Service Desk Service.*? This change is reflected in version 10.0 of the HNG-
X Agreements dated 10 September 2015 and onwards, with Schedule B3.1 noting
that, following the introduction of POL’s towers model, the Service Desk Service
ceased to be a service provided by Fujitsu “as of the 2 July 2014, with the
transfer of responsibilities for the Service Desk transferring to the Next Supplier on

the 16 June 2014”.
Engineering Service

54. The Engineer or Engineering Service (“Engineering Service”) comprised an
onsite replacement or repair service for Horizon equipment at Post Office branches
and other designated locations, together with associated support and
administrative functions (for example, training centres and the NBSC).44 The
Engineering Service was provided, in some form, from Release 1A of the Fujitsu
Services in 1997,4 until 31 March 2015 when Fujitsu ceased to provide the
Engineering Service.*° A more detailed description of the Engineering Service is

set out in paragraphs 91 to 96 of the Second Corporate Statement.4”
Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)

55. The provision of the Engineering Service was a requirement under Schedule A15

of the Codified Agreement. In particular, Requirement 468 dealt with engineering

visits to “POCL Infrastructure” and noted that “[mJaintenance and repair of the
elements of the POCL Service Infrastructure used to provide OPS involving onsite
attendance at POCL Premises by the Contractor's engineers shall not interfere
unduly with the ability of an Outlet to serve Customers, even where Outlets have

a single Counter Position and/or extremely limited physical space”.

56. The corresponding section of Schedule A16 contains Fujitsu’s Solution to

Requirement 468, which stated that:

a. Hardware “platform and associated peripherals have been chosen with
minimum maintenance in mind. All faults will be diagnosed with the aid of
expert systems by the Horizon System Helpdesk and it is anticipated that
fewer than 25% of calls will require a visit by a field engineer to replace an
unserviceable component. It is our experience that the majority of visits will

be completed within 20 minutes of arrival’.

b. _ It further clarified that “a postmaster may elect to defer a visit to a time which

he believes is more convenient for himself and his customers’.

Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)

57. As noted above, clause 1 of the Varied and Restated Agreements required Fujitsu
to perform the Operational Services, “in accordance with all applicable provisions
thereof’. Schedule 19 set out the Operational Services that were to be performed
by Fujitsu. The Operational Services included (amongst others) the ‘Engineer

Service’, defined as, “an on-site replacement or repair service for broken or faulty

Page 35 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

equipment at Branches together with associated back-up, support and
administrative functions’. The corresponding CCD was the ‘Engineer Service:
Service Description’ (with internal reference CS/SER/005) (the “Horizon Engineer

Service Description’).4°

58. Pursuant to section 1.1.1 of the Horizon Engineer Service Description, the
Engineer Service was defined as “an on-site replacement or repair service for
broken or faulty Horizon equipment at Post Office Branches and other designated
locations.” The Engineering Service had no direct involvement with software
issues. However, in relation to network and system failures, the service definition

noted that:

a. “[u]pon determining that a fault has occurred, the Post Office Branch will
contact the HSH, providing as much detail concerning the nature of the fault

as possible” (section 3.1.1);

b. “[w]here appropriate the HSH will complete diagnostic checks to attempt to
resolve the fault prior to committing a Support Engineer to attend the Post

e. “[w]here there is a hardware fault involving a faulty component the Support
Engineer will exchange that faulty component with a replacement’ (section

3.1.8).

The services that were rendered by the Engineering Service regarding
communications outages were set out in section 3.6 of the Horizon Engineer

Service Description, under ‘Transaction Recovery’, and included that:

a. “When the ISDN line is not available at a Branch or a Fujitsu Services Support
Engineer (or other suitably qualified person authorised by Fujitsu Services)
will visit that Branch (a “Recovery Visit”) and connect the working gateway
PC with the Data Centre via an ISDN emulator, a Support Engineers laptop
(configured to communicate with the Data Centre via PSTN), and the

Branch’s existing PSTN line”;

Page 37 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

b. “Connection with a Data Centre will be achieved using the ISDN emulator in
such a way that the Branch gateway PC communicates with that Data Centre
as if it was using an ISDN line. Such connection shall be achieved using a

free phone telephone number’;

c. “Once communication has been established between a Branch and a Data
Centre (via ISDN emulator, laptop and PSTN line) normal two-way Riposte
message replication will occur. This will result in both delivery of Transaction
data to the Data Centre and delivery of Reference Data changes and OBCS

Stop List changes to the Branch’.

60. Version 3.0 of the Horizon Engineer Service Description dated 15 May 2003
contained an update to provide for “exceptional service availability’ in relation to
the Engineering Service, whereby services would be provided outside the Service
Availability hours, “to provide on site engineering support for Exhibitions, Displays

or Conferences”.*°

HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)

61. In relation to the HNG-X Agreements (versions 1.0 to 14.0, dating from 31 August
2006 to present), Schedule B3.1 set out at paragraph 2 a table listing the
Operational Services which Fujitsu was required to perform, including in row 2 the

‘Engineering Service’, described as “an on-site replacement or repair service for

49 FUJ00001802
Page 38 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

broken or faulty Equipment at Branches together with associated back-up, support

and administrative functions” .

62. The ‘New CCD’ for the Engineer Service was identified as the ‘Engineering
Service: Service Description’ (with internal reference SVM/SDM/SD/0002) (the
“HNG-X Engineering Service Description”), which became applicable from

“Trigger Point T1 (Amendment Date)” .5°

63. In line with the Horizon Engineer Service Description, the HNG-X Engineering
Service Description also divided the service into “[o]n-site replacement / repair of
faulty equipment’ and “Transaction Recovery’. This distinction remained in place
from 1 September 2006 to “Trigger Point T6 (HNG-X Application Roll Out
Complete)”. The transaction recovery provisions were no longer present in version

5.0 of the HNG-X Engineering Service Description dated 3 July 2012.

64. With regards to the ‘on-site replacement / repair of faulty equipment’ provisions,

the HNG-X Engineering Service Description noted in particular that:

a. “[t]he Fujitsu Services Support Engineer will assess and seek to diagnose the
Counter Equipment fault and, where possible, will rectify the fault through
simple adjustment, reconnection, cleaning or advice to Branch personnel”

(section 2.1.1.5);

b.  “[w]here there is a Hardware fault involving a faulty component, the Fujitsu
Services Support Engineer will exchange that faulty component with a

replacement’ (section 2.1.1.7); and

c.  ‘“[t]he Fujitsu Services Support Engineer will ensure that the Counter

Equipment is working correctly prior to leaving the Branch” (section 2.1.1.8).

65. The services in relation to Transaction Recovery were addressed in section 3.1.2
of the HNG-X Engineering Service Description, in relation to branches “not yet
migrated to the HNG-X Application’. Version 5.0 of the HNG-X Engineering
Service Description dated 3 July 2012 did not contain the Transaction Recovery

services.

66. Pursuant to CCN 1423c, from 18 August 2015, Fujitsu ceased to provide the
Engineering Service as the service had expired on 31 March 2015.5! This change
is reflected in version 11.0 of the HNG-X Agreements dated 31 March 2016 and

onwards.

Third Line Support Service

67. Throughout the Relevant Period, the Third Line Support Service has provided
technical support to resolve incidents that the Service Desk (including the relevant
second line support teams) are unable to resolve. Provision of the Third Line

Support Service continues to the present day.

WITN06650400

Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)

68.

69.

The Third Line Support Service was originally provided as part of the general

Service Desk Service under Requirement 914 of Schedule A15, which noted:

a. Fujitsu Service Desk Service was to “provide first, second and third level

Services...”; and

b. — “[i]f the Help Desk is unable to resolve a problem at the first or second level
[Fujitsu] shall categorise and prioritise the problem so that it can be actioned
and completed within a standard timescale”. This Requirement is repeated in

paragraph 6.3.3 of Schedule G01.

Fujitsu’s Solutions as set out in Schedule A16 of the Codified Agreement then

stated as follows:

a. “Level 3 service is invoked when the call cannot be fully resolved wholly
within the Horizon System Helpdesk but requires escalation either to a higher
level of technical support or to an engineer to perform a maintenance visit’

(paragraph 2.4.1);

b. “Calls will be transferred to Level 3 support electronically complete with all
of the details of progress made at levels 1 and 2. Calls will be prioritised and
categorised so that they can be actioned within standard agreed timescales”

(paragraph 2.4.2);

Page 41 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

c. “All level 3 calls will be monitored to ensure that the Service Level Agreement
is met. The call will also continue to be monitored post resolution to ensure
that repeat or intermittent failures are identified as quickly as possible”

(paragraph 2.4.3); and

d. “Level 3 calls will be analysed to identify patterns and trends of failure either

within specific Outlets or with system items” (paragraph 2.4.4).
Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)

70. As noted above, clause 1 of the Varied and Restated Agreements provided that
Fujitsu was required to perform the Operational Services, “in accordance with all

applicable provisions thereof’.

71. Schedule 19 set out the Operational Services that were to be performed by Fujitsu
which, throughout the period of the Varied and Restated Agreements, included
Third Line Support as a distinct service (and not as part of the Service Desk). The
Third Line Support Service was defined in this regard as the “[s]ervice for the
diagnosis of new software incidents occurring in Branches and the data centre”,
and the corresponding CCD was entitled ‘Service Description for Third Line
Software Support Service’ (with internal reference CS/SER/009) (the “Horizon

Third Line Support Service Description’).52

72. Further detail in relation to the Horizon Third Line Support Service Description is

set out in paragraphs 76 to 79 in the Second Corporate Statement. For ease of

52 FUJ00001735 (v 1.0 dated 19 December 2002)
Page 42 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

reference, the sections of the Horizon Third Line Support Service Description most
relevant to the Incident Management Obligations stated that Third Line Support

was responsible for:

a. “The investigation, in accordance with operational procedures, of suspected
new software errors escalated from the Horizon Systems Help Desk and

Systems Management Centre” (section 3.0(a)).

b. In the context of workarounds (section 3.0(b)):

(i) “updating of entries on a support knowledge database”; and

(ii) I “provision to Fourth Line Support of sufficient information to enable
further diagnosis and the production of a software fix where

appropriate”.

c.  “[R]ecovery of transactions from Branches in circumstances where it has not
been possible to deploy the laptop emulator solution and hence the relevant
processor or processors have been recovered via the Engineer Service

(CS/SER/005) to a central site” (section 3.0(d)).

HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)

73. In relation to the HNG-X Agreements, the table at paragraph 2 of Schedule B3.1
sets out the Operational Services to be performed by Fujitsu. As with the Varied
and Restated Agreements, the Third Line Support Service is described as a

“[slervice for the diagnosis of new software Incidents occurring in Branches and

Page 43 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

the Data Centre” excluding support for “Configured POL FS or the SAP Loading

Applications” (namely those applications managed by POL).

74. The ‘New CCD’ for Third Line Support was identified as the ‘Third Line Support
Service: Service Description’ (with internal reference SVM/SDM/SD/0004)* (the
“HNG-X Third Line Support Service Description”) which replaced the Horizon
Third Line Support Service Description (with internal reference CS/SER/009) when
it came into effect upon the “Commencement of HNG-X Project Workstream X4

(HNG-X Application Rollout)”.

75. Further detail in relation to the HNG-X Third Line Support Service Description (with
internal reference SVM/SDM/SD/0004) is addressed in paragraphs 76 to 79 of the
Second Corporate Statement. In short, the HNG-X Third Line Support Service
Description described at a high level the “technical support provided by the Third

Line Support Service to the appropriate Operational Services”, including:
a. The Service Desk Service, which in particular noted (section 2.1.1.1):

(i) “Data relating to Incidents are passed from the Service Desk Incident
Management Systems via a technical interface to the Third Line

Support Service fault management tool...”. From version 2.0 of the

HNG-X Third Line Support Service Description this tool was

confirmed to be “Peak’,®4 and from version 3.0, the tool was referred

to as an “electronic interface to the Third Line Support Service

incident management tool (Peak)”;®> and

(ii) I “Third Line Support Service will provide information for, and maintain

the Known Error Log (KEL)”;
b. I The Fourth Line Support Service described below, including:

(i) assistance “in the development of Software fixtures required...”

(section 2.1.1.4); and

(ii) the two services were to “...work closely together in the identification
and resolution of Software Incidents requiring bug fixes”

(section 2.7.1.5);

c. The Engineering Service described above, including assistance “in the

resolution of Hardware Incidents within the Branch” (section 2.1.1.10);

d. IThe Management Information Service described below, including assistance
“in the generation of management information in response to Miscellaneous
Data Requests in respect of ad-hoc data extractions” (section 2.1.1.11);5°

and

e. The Reconciliation Service described below, including assistance “in the

resolution of Reconciliation Incidents where Transaction information is

55 FUJ00002233 (v 3.0 dated 9 August 2010)

56 The language of this section 2.1.1.11 was revised from the HNG-X Third Line Support Service Description
(SVM/SDM/SD/0004), FUJ00002081 (v 2.0 dated 4 September 2008) to refer to “Ad-Hoc Data Requests”
as opposed to “Miscellaneous Data Requests”

required following interrogation of the HNG-X Central Infrastructure. This will
also include the re-sending of rejected Transactions to Post Office or Clients

following the resolution of a Reconciliation Incident’ (section 2.1.1.12).

76. In addition, Third Line Support was responsible for investigating “any suspected
new Software errors escalated from the Service Desk or Systems Management
Service and provide Software fixes, as required...” (section 2.1.1.13, HNG-X Third

Line Support Service Description).
Fourth Line Support Service®”

77. In outline, Fourth Line Support was formally introduced into the Horizon contract
with version 1.0 of the Varied and Restatement Agreement dated 31 December
20025 and continues to the present day. Fourth Line Support provided support for
software and system errors insofar as they could not be resolved by the Third Line
Support Service. Fourth Line Support was also responsible for developing new
software functionality and products (including those required to address BEDs in
the Horizon system). After the introduction of HNG-X, Fourth Line Support was
also referred to as the Application Support Service and was delivered by Fujitsu’s

Application Division teams, in addition to certain teams based overseas.

57 Although Fourth Line Support was classified as a ‘Development Service’ in the Codified Agreement and
Varied and Restated Agreements, it is convenient to deal with it under the heading Operational Services,
together with the other relevant services.

WITN06650400
WITN06650400

Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)

78. As noted above, under Schedule A01 of the Codified Agreement, the Service Desk
was defined as “[t]he initial point of call for Users in need of support relating to the
POCL Services”. The role of the Service Desk was set out more particularly at
Section 6 of Schedule G01. This provision, however, included only the first, second

and third lines of support.

79. Whilst Fourth Line Support was not reflected in the contractual documentation at
the time, in practice, Fujitsu operated a team which was responsible for, amongst
other things, fixing new software problems that could not be resolved by the Third

Line Support Service.

80. The existence and responsibilities of Fourth Line Support were set out in other
documents including the ‘End to end support process operational agreement’ (with
internal reference CS/FSP/006) dated 10 October 1999,5° which stated at section
6 that, among other things, Fourth Line Support should (i) “receive incidents
passed from the SSC”, and (ii) “ensure that the incident is resolved within the total

time allowed by the contract between [POL] and [Fujitsu]”.
Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)

81. The ‘Fourth Line Application Service’ was formally defined in the Varied and

Restated Agreements at Schedule 1, as “[s]upport of the systems infrastructure

WITN06650400
WITN06650400

(used to provide services to [POL] by [Fujitsu]) through the development of bug

fixes, patches or similar restorative or preventative software’.

82. As noted above, Fourth Line Support was not classified as an Operational Service;
at this time, it formed part of the ‘Development Services’ provided under the Varied

and Restated Agreements. Paragraph 2.1 of Schedule 20 stated:

“The following Services are referred to together as “Development
Services”...
SI! Support Services (including Fourth Line Support and Fujitsu Services’

internal re-architecting projects)”.
HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)

83. In relation to the HNG-X Agreements, Schedule 1, read with Table A of Schedule
B3.1, defined the ‘Application Support Service (Fourth Line)’ as providing “support
for software and system errors which cannot be resolved by the Third Line
Software Support Service”. Schedule B3.1 identified the relevant CCD for the
Fourth Line Support as the ‘Application Support Service (Fourth Line): Service
Description’ (with internal reference SVM/SDM/SD/0005) (the “Fourth Line

Service Description”).

Fourth Line Support included (amongst other things):

a. “receiving from the Third Line Support Service, Software related Incidents

which cannot be resolved by the Third Line Support Service’;

b. “identifying a “known error” following receipt of the Incident from the Third
Line Support Service, where this information will be communicated to the
Third Line Support Service and the appropriate Known Error Log (KEL) will
be updated and the information disseminated to the Service Desk to enable

the resolution of similar Incidents”;

c. “ensuring the internal [Fujitsu] Incident management systems are updated
with the Incident resolution details prior to return to the Third Line Support

Service together with the method of recreation of the problem”; and

d. “ensuring that any resolutions or workarounds which are returned to the Third
Line Support Service have been tested (including regression testing) and
have been correctly authorised in accordance with the Release Authorisation

Process’.

various changes in the scope of Fourth Line Support are addressed in more detail

at paragraphs 80 to 90 of Fujitsu’s Second Corporate Statement.
Service Management Service

86. The Service Management Service was first established in May 1996 as part of the
Pathway Programme to monitor, manage and maintain the delivery of the
Operational Services. Provision of the Service Management Service continues to

the present day.
Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)

87. Pursuant to clause 601 of the Codified Agreement, POL was entitled to monitor
Fujitsu’s performance of its obligations under the agreement in accordance with
the procedures set out in Schedule A04, which concerned “Contract

Management’ .©

88. Schedule A04 provided that the objectives of Contract Management were to
monitor and manage the delivery of the Operational Services and authorise actions
which improved those services.®* The schedule specified that Fujitsu and POL
were to establish several joint boards within one month following execution of the
Codified Agreement to give effect to these objectives. Relevant to the Incident

Management Obligations, Fujitsu and POL were to establish a Service Review

Board (which at various times has been known as the ‘Monthly Service Review
Board’, ® ‘Service Management Forum’, ‘Service Management Relationship’,
‘Service Management Review’, ‘Joint Service Review Board’, or ‘Horizon Service
Review Forum’) (“Service Management Review Forum’”).*” I understand that the
Service Management Review Forum has operated throughout the Relevant
Period, however the precise structure, name, attendees, frequency and functions
of this forum and related review and management forums may have changed from

time to time.

89. According to Schedule A04, the purpose of the Service Management Review

Forum was stated as follows:
“To review performance against contracted service levels.
To agree remedies payable arising from any failures to meet service levels.
To monitor and review operations of operational business change processes.

Such other purposes as are set out in the relevant service management

schedules.”®®

90. Schedule A04 provided that the Service Management Review Forum was to be a
monthly meeting attended by (i) POL’s Head of Service Management, (ii) POL’s

Meeting secretary, and (iii) Fujitsu’s Customer Service Director.® If remedies were

to be discussed at the Service Management Review Forum, it appears POL’s
Horizon Commercial Manager and Fujitsu’s Financial Controller were also required
to attend.”° Other members of POL and Fujitsu could attend at either party's
discretion.’1 According to Schedule A04, decisions of the Service Management
Review Forum were only effective if approved by POL’s Head of Service

Management and Fujitsu’s Customer Service Director.’2

91. Pursuant to clause 602.2 of the Codified Agreement, Fujitsu was to provide
‘Management Services’ as specified in ‘Service Management’ schedules relating
to each operational service. These schedules were: Schedule E05 (Automated
Payment Service (“APS") Service Management), Schedule F05 (EPOSS Service
Management), Schedule GO7 (POCL Infrastructure Service Management),
Schedule HO5 (OBCS Service Management), and Schedule K05 (Logistics Feeder
Service (“LFS”) Service Management) (together, the “Service Management
Schedules”). ”° Notwithstanding these schedules being distinct for each
Operational Service, the ‘Management Services’ described in them were

substantially similar and included the following:

a. The objectives of service management were to “monitor and manage the
delivery’ of the operational service and “report on the same to the Contract

Steering Group defined in Schedule A04.”

70 FUJ00000071

™ FUJ00000071

72 FUJ00000071

73 These schedules appear to be precursors to the ‘Service Description’ CCD for the Service Management
Service, which was first approved under the Varied & Restated Agreements as detailed below at paragraph
95

Page 52 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

b. Fujitsu and POL were to “establish an organisational structure to manage the

delivery’ of the operational service in accordance with its service description.
c. The key Fujitsu personnel responsible for service delivery were:

(i) I the Operational Service Manager, who was to attend the Service

Management Review Forum;

(ii) I the Service Manager, who was responsible for the overall delivery of
the service to POL. The Service Manager was responsible for, inter
alia, the maintenance of Service Levels, providing monthly service
reports, and briefing the Operational Services Manager in advance of

the Service Management Review Forum meetings; and

(iii) I the Service Desk Manager, who was responsible for the management

of “POCL problems and enquiries’.”4
d. The key POL personnel responsible for service delivery were:

(i) I the POL Business Manager, who was responsible for the “business
which the [operational] service supports” and who also attended the

Service Management Review Forum;

74 The exception to this was in relation to Service Management for LFS. Fujitsu's Service Desk Manager
for this service was only responsible for calls relating to LFS software or infrastructure as identified in the
Call Enquiry Matrix. Fujitsu's Service Desk Manager was not responsible for managing calls relating to POL
procedures and the use of LFS within the branch. Where such calls were made to the Service Desk, the
caller was to be advised to contact the appropriate POL helpdesk.

(ii) I the POL Liaison Manager responsible for the day-to-day liaison with
Fujitsu, and was responsible for, inter alia, monitoring delivered
service levels, receiving and analysing monthly service reports, and
briefing the POL Business Manager in advance of the Service

Management Review Forum meetings; and

(iii) in relation to the Management Services for LFS, POL was responsible

for providing its own “Helpdesk service for LFS users” .”5

e. Fujitsu and POL were to operate escalation procedures for issues affecting
the operational service in accordance with Schedule A04 of the Codified

Agreement.

f. Fujitsu was to provide POL with a monthly Service Management Report
(which at various times has been known as a ‘Service Review’, ‘Service
Review Book’ or ‘Service Management Review’) (“Service Management
Report’), which would allow POL to monitor Fujitsu’s service provision and
achievement of service levels. These reports were to include (i) “service
breaks/service failures”, and (ii) “incidents resolved and outstanding”, and
Fujitsu was to provide POL access to “the raw data used to generate service
management reports when requested” to allow POL to generate POL internal
reports.”® The Service Management Report was the primary input into the

Service Management Review Forum and was provided to POL by the

127 below.

g. The POL Business Manager and Fujitsu's Operational Service Manager were
to meet every three months (or as otherwise agreed by them) to “review
Service Levels, Incidents and Problems reported in the previous period”.’””
Fujitsu was to “prepare the necessary reports for discussion” at the meeting
and POL was to keep a record of the meeting and distribute this to Fujitsu
and the “POCL Contract Manager for review at the Contract Steering Group

Meeting”.”®

92. As noted above at paragraph 37, under Schedule A8 of the Codified Agreement,
ICL Sorbus was listed as the subcontractor responsible for the “Operation of
Horizon System Help Desk and Service Management Centre.”’9 References to

ICL Sorbus are removed from the Varied and Restated Agreements.

Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)

93. Pursuant to clause 25 of the Varied and Restated Agreements, POL was entitled
to monitor Fujitsu’s performance of its obligations under the agreement in
accordance with Schedule 4 (Governance) and Schedule 19 (Operational

Services).

HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)

97. Pursuant to clause 3.1 of the HNG-X Agreements, Fujitsu and POL are to govern
their relationship in accordance with the provisions of Schedule A2 (Relationship
and Governance), which includes the ‘Service Management Relationship’. As with
Annex 1 to Schedule 4 of the Varied and Restated Agreements, Annex 1 to
Schedule A2 sets out the various joint forums that are to be held by Fujitsu and
POL to monitor and manage the Horizon contract, including their composition, role

98. As noted above, Schedule B3.1 of the HNG-X Agreements lists the Operational
Services which Fujitsu is required to perform, including in row 11 the ‘Service
Management Service’. The schedule describes the Service Management Service
as follows: “The objectives of the Service are to monitor, manage and maintain the
delivery of the Operational Services. This Service also includes: [i] The Capacity
Management Service [ii] The Release management service.”®* Under the HNG-X
Agreements, the service was expanded to include the ‘Capacity Management
Service’ and the ‘Release Management Service’ (although I understand from the
POA that ‘Release Introduction’ and ‘Capacity management’ were components of
the Service Management Service under the Varied and Restated Agreements as
set out in the Horizon Service Management Description and explained in

paragraphs 23 and 26 to 32 of the Second Corporate Statement).®”

99. The ‘New CCD’ for the Service Management Service was identified as the ‘Service
Management Service: Service Description’ (with internal reference
SVM/SDM/SD/0007) (“HNG-X Service Management Description’), ® which
replaced the Horizon Service Management Description upon the “Commencement

Systems Management Service

101. The Systems Management Service was an internal Fujitsu service provided by the
Systems Management Centre (“SMC”). The delivery of the Systems Management
Service during Legacy Horizon and HNG-X is addressed in more detail in Fujitsu’s
Second Corporate Statement at paragraphs 50 to 61. Relevant to the Incident
Management Obligations, the service provided events management and systems
monitoring, including to monitor for indicators of software or hardware conditions
that could impact the branch infrastructure, as well as the distribution of software

to the branch infrastructure. ®°
Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)

102. While the Systems Management Service was not formally defined as a service in
the Codified Agreement, the agreement nonetheless imposed a number of

obligations on Fujitsu in relation to systems management.

103. Requirement 537 at Schedule A15 required Fujitsu to “carry out system
management of all the POCL Services in a consistent and coherent manner to
ensure the following: (a) Activities within the POCL Services, including TMS, OPS,
OBCS, APS and EPOSS; (b) Changes to the POCL Services can be made

speedily and accurately.”

104. The specified solution to Requirement 537 at Schedule A16 provided that:

“The Pathway strategy for System Management will comprises a set of services

as follows:

Software repository — the storage and maintenance of records identifying what

software versions are stored on what machines.

Software distribution — the scheduling of software upgrades to a defined set of

machines.

Event management — the notification of significant events to a central source.

Asset management — the storage and maintenance of information on the

existence/type of machines and associated peripherals.

Configuration management — the non-static configuration parameters that drive the
applications and operating system. This includes Resource Monitoring and

Network Management’.

105. As noted earlier, under Clause 201.2 of the Codified Agreement, Fujitsu was to
deliver the solutions at Schedule A16 by performing the Core System Services

(which were those services specified in clause 201.3).

106. The relevant Core System Services for systems management were the
Operational Services pursuant to clause 405 and, specifically, the POCL

Infrastructure Services, in accordance with the provisions of Schedule G01.

Page 62 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

107. Paragraph 5 of Schedule G01 required, amongst other things, that:

a. “A Systems Management function shall be deployed [by Fujitsu] based on a

central service delivery capability, able to interact with each of the Outlets’.

b. Fujitsu “shall carry out system management of all POCL Services in a
consistent and coherent manner. The activities within each POCL Service

Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)

108. As noted above, clause 1 of the Varied and Restated Agreements provided that
Fujitsu was required to perform the Operational Services, “in accordance with all

applicable provisions thereof’.

109. The Systems Management Service was formally defined at Table A of Schedule 1
of the Varied and Restated Agreements. The ‘Systems Management Service’ was
described as “Event management and software distribution services.” The
corresponding CCD was given as the ‘Service Description for Systems
Management Service’ (with internal reference CS/SER/008) (the “Horizon
Systems Management Service Description”).® This service description and its
contents were referred to in the Second Corporate Statement at paragraphs 50
and 51, however, the service is noted to have included “[mJonitoring of events in
the Branch infrastructure and data centre estate. Events are the indications of
conditions that have operational significance. They include software, hardware or
security conditions that may require investigation and also include occurrences of

events such as low battery in PIN Pads...”
HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)

110. In relation to the HNG-X Agreements, Schedule 1, read with Table A of Schedule
B3.1, described the Systems Management Service as providing “Event

management and software distribution services.” Schedule B3.1 identified the

‘New CCD’ for the Systems Management Service as the ‘Systems Management
Service: Service Description’ (with internal reference SVM/SDM/SD/0006) (the
“HNG-X Systems Management Service Description”) which replaced the
Horizon Systems Management Service Description (CS/SER/008) upon the
“Commencement of HNG-X Project Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application

Rollout)”.9"

111. The first version of the HNG-X Systems Management Service Description
(SVM/SDM/SD/0006) dated 31 August 2006° provided at paragraph 1.1 that the

Systems Management Service would comprise:
a. “an event management service”;

b. “a systems monitoring service”; and

c. “a software distribution service’.

112. Further detail regarding the content of the HNG-X Systems Management Service
Description (with internal reference SVM/SDM/SD/0006) and the delivery of the
Systems Management Service during the HNG-X period is addressed at
paragraphs 56 to 61 of the Second Corporate Statement, and (similarly to the
period of the Varied and Restated Agreements) included at section 2.1.1 “event

and systems monitoring of both the Branch Infrastructure and HNG-X Central

Infrastructure. Events are the indications of conditions that have operational
Significance to either the Branch Infrastructure or the HNG-X Central Infrastructure.
They include Software, Hardware or security conditions that may require
investigation and also include occurrences of particular, repeated events, for

example, a low battery in PIN Pads.”
Management Information Service

113. The available documentation suggests that the Management Information Service
was first established during the Pathway Programme in or around 1997.9% The
Management Information Service continued under the various phases of the
Horizon contract described above and continues to be provided to the present day.
The primary purpose of the Management Information Service is to deliver
performance reporting and management information to POL relating to Horizon
and the Operational Services. This reporting and management information
includes the Service Management Reports considered at Service Management
Review Forum meetings as required by the CCDs relating to the Service

Management Service (noted at paragraphs 86 to 100 above).
Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)

114. Pursuant to clause 201.2 of the Codified Agreement, Fujitsu was responsible
(subject to certain qualifications) for meeting the Requirements specified in

Schedule A15 in accordance with the Solutions specified in Schedule A16 by

%8 Integration Testing Business Thread BITO2 for release 1c (VI/TSC/0009), FUJ00232415 (v 1.0 dated 1
July 1997)

Page 66 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

performing the Core System Services (i.e., those services specified in clause
201.3, as described above). The relevant Core System Services were the

Operational Services pursuant to clause 405 of the Codified Agreement.

115. Under Schedule A01 of the Codified Agreement, ‘M/S’ is defined as “Management
Information Systems”. As set out in Schedule A15, the relevant Requirement for
MIS was Requirement 894, pursuant to which Fujitsu and POL were to “agree the
arrangements for MIS reports and POCL control mechanisms’. Schedule A16
recorded the Solution to Requirement 894 as being that MIS would “capture the
data necessary to facilitate effective contract and service management. It will

employ exception reporting for business performance and monitoring reviews”.

116. Paragraph 6 of Schedule E01 stated that, to satisfy Requirement 894, Fujitsu was
to “provide management information with reference to service performance”, the
details of which were to be defined in the POCL MIS Reports document, as

introduced by CCN 0016.%

117. Service reporting obligations were also set out in relation to the Operational
Services in the Service Management Schedules. Relevantly, Fujitsu was required
to provide POL with the monthly Service Management Reports as explained at

paragraph 91 in this statement.

118. Version 1.0 of process document ‘MIS Report Production and Scheduling’ (with

internal reference CS/PRO/031) dated 21 October 1997°% detailed the production

and scheduling of reports, including for change requests, problem reporting, and
ad-hoc queries, to “meet the requirements of MIS”. Related document ‘MIS Report
Despatch Procedure’ (with internal reference CS/PRO/030) dated 21 October
1997 outlined the procedure for the production and distribution of MIS Reports,

including compact disk logs and problem reports.%

Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)

119. As above, under clause 1 of the Varied and Restated Agreements, Fujitsu was
required to perform the Operational Services, “in accordance with all applicable
provisions thereof’. Schedule 19 set out the Operational Services to be performed
by Fujitsu, including (but not limited to) the ‘Management Information Service’,
defined as providing “a mechanism for the reporting and publishing of Fujitsu
Services’ achievement of Service Levels and targets”, “data for the settlement of
liquidated damages’, and “a vehicle for the request of information regarding data

captured on the Horizon Service Infrastructure.”

120. The corresponding CCD was the ‘Management Information Service: Service
Description’ (with internal reference CS/SER/015) (the “Horizon MIS Service
Description”).°” Each version of the MIS Service Description required Fujitsu to
deliver to POL a Service Management Report (then known as a Service Review
Book), for “the primary input into the Service Management Forum reporting on

performance against [Service Level Targets]”. The Service Review Book included

%6 FUJ00232469
97 FUJ00120479 (v 1.0 dated 20 December 2002); FUJ00001910 (v 2.0 dated 18 November 2004);
FUJ00001965 (v 3.0 dated 8 July 2005)

Page 68 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

(amongst other things) a management summary (containing highlights of the
previous month’s service delivery); a high-level review of each of the supplied
services; service volumetric data available (including the number of calls received
by the Service Desk Service); a high-level review of problem management and
problem status; and Engineer Services failures attracting remedies (section 3.1 of
each version). The Service Review Book also contained Service Level Agreements

(“SLA”) information, including the level of SLA achievement for various services.

121. The Horizon MIS Service Description further described the purpose of the
Management Information Service as being to deliver to POL Network Banking
management information in accordance with the Operational Services through
Network Banking MIS Reports (with reference to ‘Network Banking MIS Reports
Design’ (with internal reference NB/SDS/008), the “MIS Reporting Design”).°°

Such management information is stated to have included, but was not limited to:

a. A monthly MIS Money Laundering Report “listing, by Branch, the cash
deposit Banking Transactions that exceeded the configurable threshold
specified in the above CCD [the MIS Reporting Design], together with a Post
Office Branch summary giving the number and value of such Banking

Transactions.”

b. Aweekly MIS Transaction Outcome Analysis by Branch Report detailing the

number and value of Banking Transactions for the previous accounting week.

Page 69 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

c. A weekly MIS Bank Analysis Report detailing harvested Banking
Transactions as specified in the MIS Reporting Design. Under Section 4 of
Annex 3 to Schedule 15: Part A of the Varied and Restated Agreements,
Fujitsu was obliged to pay liquidated damages to POL if Fujitsu did not
provide the MIS Bank Analysis Report once a week (or at such later time as
specified) to POL. Such liquidated damages were calculated as equalling:
(number of Transactions on report in question/1,000,000) x (number of

working days report is late x £55).

122. Under the Horizon MIS Service Description, Fujitsu was also required to deliver to
POL: management information regarding OBCS and APS transactions (section 3.2
of each version); Miscellaneous Data Query Requests at POL’s request (section
3.3 of each version); and information leading to the settlement of liquidated
damages (where applicable) (section 3.4 of each version). The calculation of

liquidated damages is further outlined in paragraphs 224 to 262.

HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)

123. In relation to the HNG-X Agreements, paragraph 2 of Schedule B3.1 set out the
Operational Services to be performed by Fujitsu, including the ‘Management
Information Service’ at row 10. Following the description in the Varied and
Restated Agreements, the Management Information Service is described in the
HNG-X Agreements as providing “a mechanism for the reporting and publishing of

Fujitsu Services’ achievement of Service Levels and Service Level Targets”, “data

Page 70 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

for the settlement of liquidated damages”, and “a vehicle for the request of

information regarding data captured on the HNG-X Service Infrastructure.”

124. Replacing the Horizon MIS Service Description (with internal reference
CS/SER/015), the ‘New CCD’ was identified as ‘Management Information Service:
Service Description’ (with internal reference SVM/SDM/SD/0016) (the “HNG-X
MIS Service Description”), which came into effect upon the “Commencement of
HNG-X Project Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout)”.°° The HNG-X MIS
Service Description (with internal reference SVM/SDM/SD/0016), like the Horizon
MIS Service Description (with internal reference CS/SER/015), required Fujitsu to
deliver to POL the Service Review Book, described as “the primary input into the
Service Management Relationship” (paragraph 2.1.1 of each version). The Service
Review Book, as before, included (amongst other things) a management summary
(containing highlights of the previous month’s service delivery); a summary review
of the Operational Services delivered; a summary of problem management and
cross domain problem status; and monthly Service Level Threshold achievements.
From at least November 2013, the content of the Service Review Books was
amended so that, amongst other things, the management summary was “delivered
to [POL] as separate documents or presentations at an agreed time each month.”
However, Service Management Reports identified by Fujitsu to date and disclosed

to the Inquiry indicate that this practice began around the end of 2010.

WITN06650400
WITN06650400

125. According to version 1.0 of the HNG-X MIS Service Description dated 31 August
2008, 1° the Management Information Service consisted of six other component
services, including the delivery and/or provision of, amongst other things,
supporting information in relation to liquidated damages; management information
in relation to Banking and Related Services data; management information in
relation to APS; management information in relation to Miscellaneous Data
Queries; and the Service Management Portal for access to real time updates of
Service performance and Service Level Target measurement. Reference to the
provision of management information related to APS was removed by version 4.0,
dated 24 November 2010, ‘°' and reference to the provision of Banking and
Related Services data to POL was further removed by version 5.0, dated 5

November 2013.10

126. As under the Varied and Restated Agreements, Fujitsu was obliged to pay
liquidated damages to POL if Fujitsu did not provide the MIS Bank Analysis Report
once a week (or such later time as specified) to POL under Section 4 of Annex 3
to Schedule B4.4. Such liquidated damages were calculated as equalling: (number
of Transactions on report in question/1,000,000) x (number of working days report
is late x £69.79). Reference to the MIS Bank Analysis Report was removed in

version 3.0 of the HNG-X MIS Service Description dated 9 February 2010.1

Schedule B4.4 was removed from version 14.0 of the HNG-X Agreements onward

by CCN 1648b.1

127. Table A of Schedule B3.1 of the HNG-X Agreements further specified that the
Transaction Benchmarking Service was to be included within the Management
Information Service. Each version of the HNG-X MIS Service Description noted
that the Management Information Service was responsible for the provision of the
Transaction Time Benchmarking Service, with a summary of set out in Annex A:
“[t]he Transaction Benchmarking Service provides a measure of transaction time
performance for an agreed set of transactions which may be varied at any time
subject to the Change Control Procedure and agreement between [POL] and
[Fujitsu]”. The previous corresponding CCD for the Transaction Benchmarking
Service under the Varied and Restated Agreements, ‘Transaction Benchmarking
Service: Service Description’ (with internal reference CS/SER/010), 1° was
replaced by ‘Transaction Time Benchmarking Process’ (with internal reference
SVM/SDM/PRO/0017), which outlined the relevant transactions and process for

performance measurement. 1
Reconciliation Service

128. Under the Reconciliation Service, Fujitsu provided end-to-end reconciliation and
incident management procedures required to investigate, report and resolve

reconciliation and Business Incidents throughout the Relevant Period. The

104 CCN No. 1648b raised 22 January 2021, FUJ00234945
105 FUJ00232526 (v 1.0 dated 31 December 2002); FUJ00232541 (v 2.0 dated 2 July 2004)
196 FUJ00232610 (v 1.0 dated 17 July 2009)

Page 73 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

Reconciliation Service was introduced under the Codified Agreement (though as
set out in paragraph 63 of the Second Corporate Statement, Fujitsu’s Business
Support Unit (“BSU”) was responsible for generating various reconciliation reports
since at least November 1998), and the service continued under the various

versions of the Horizon contract described above.

Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)

129. The provision of a Reconciliation Service was listed as Requirement 891 in
Schedule A15 of the Codified Agreement and was described as “[Fujitsu’s
obligation to] ensure that all captured data are complete and accurately reflected
in the appropriate outward interfaces”. The corresponding section of Schedule A16
contained Fujitsu’s Solution to Requirement 891, and stated, amongst other things,

that Fujitsu was required to:

a. “ensure that all captured data (that is inward data across service interfaces)
is complete, and accurately reflected in the appropriate outward interfaces”

(paragraph 1.1).

b. “report reconciliation results to POCL, including any reconciliation
exceptions. Reconciliation Exceptions will be held in a Reconciliation
Exception Database (RED) and the progress to resolution of each

outstanding exception will be reported to POCL” (paragraph 1.5).

c. “control the implementation of configuration changes, including changes to

reference data’, including “maintaining the integrity of other reconciliation

Page 74 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

processes against configuration changes” (paragraph 1.7a, Reference 891,

Schedule A16).

d. “meet all reconciliation requirements in contingency situations as well as

normal working” (paragraph 1.7b, Reference 891, Schedule A16).

e. “The reconciliation of stock and money for transactions will be, in effect,
instantaneous, with a record of the levels of stock and money within a stock

unit being maintained as the transaction is committed” (paragraph 2.3).

130. In addition to the above, Fujitsu's Solution to Requirement 891 stipulated that the
targets for the Reconciliation Service would be as follows (paragraph 1.8,

Schedule A16):

a. “full reconciliation with 100% of items accounted for’;

b. — “provision of reconciliation reports identifying reconciliation totals at summary
level and RED reports for reconciliation exceptions at detailed levels, for
example at transaction level for transaction data”. Such reports would be
provided to POL “by 9 am of the day following that in which the reconciliation

exception occurred”.

c.  “[Fujitsu] will resolve any reconciliation exceptions produced by its
reconciliation processes” and would use all reasonable endeavours to do so

promptly.

131. The relevant CCD to the Reconciliation Service under the Codified Agreement in
this regard was version 1.0 of the Transaction Processing Services ("TPS")
Reconciliation & Incident Management Procedure (with internal reference
CS/PRO/111) dated 16 October 2000. This document described the procedures
required to “investigate, report and resolve TPS reconciliation and business
incidents"'”’ and set out the “procedures to be adopted by the [MSU], for dealing
with Business Incidents relating to the TPS Report Set errors and PON generated
Business Incidents. This includes reconciling the data contained in the TPS Report
Set and raising Horizon System Help Desk (HSH) Business Incidents, Business
Incident Management System (BIMS) Reports and Manual Error Reports (MER)

where necessary” .'°8

132. Business Incidents were defined in the TPS Reconciliation & Incident Management
Procedure as those which “Relate to the ‘Symptom’ of an underlying cause — e.g.
the effect of the system fault on the resulting reconciliation or settlement
information sent to [POL]’, and were reported to the Post Office through the
Business Incident Management Service (“BIMS”) ‘°°. System Incidents were
defined as those which “relate[d] to the underlying ‘Cause’ and would be routed

to the appropriate group within Fujitsu to investigate and resolve‘.

133. According to paragraph 3.5.4 of the TPS Reconciliation & Incident Management

Procedure, Fujitsu would also “monitor ‘trigger points’, for example HSH calls and

the TPS Report Set, which can alert of any likely potential or actual ‘widespread’
errors which are those Data Errors or Not Data Errors affecting Cash Accounts in

a Cash Account Period at more than 100 outlets”"'.
Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)

134. As noted above, Fujitsu was required under clause 1 of the Varied and Restated
Agreements to perform the Operational Services, “in accordance with all applicable
provisions thereof’. Schedule 19 set out the Operational Services that were to be
performed by Fujitsu, which included the ‘Reconciliation Service’ throughout the
period of the Varied and Restated Agreements. This service was defined as the
provision of “end-to-end reconciliation and incident management procedures
required to investigate, report and resolve reconciliation and business incidents”.

The corresponding CCDs were as follows:

a. Network Banking Reconciliation & Incident Management (with internal
reference NB/PRO/002)''?, TPS Reconciliation & Incident Management (with
internal reference CS/PRO/111)1'?, and APS Reconciliation & Incident
Management (with internal reference CS/PRO/128)''*. These documents
described the management procedures for investigating, reporting and

resolving reconciliation and business incidents in respect of Network

Banking, APS and TPS. They also set out the reconciliation reports that
Fujitsu was required to run on a daily or weekly basis for the relevant system
functionality. Within these reconciliation reports, Fujitsu was to identify errors
which constituted Business Incidents and System Incidents, defined as so

under the Codified Agreement (see paragraph 132) above.

b. Data Errors & Not Data Errors — Contractual Definitions (CS/SER/017)'§ and
Network Banking Data Reconciliation Services (CS/SER/018)'7®, containing

contractual definitions in relation to the Reconciliation Services.

135. According to Version 2.0 of the TPS Reconciliation & Incident Management CCD
(with internal reference CS/PRO/111) dated 30 April 2002, Fujitsu was required to
“monitor ‘trigger points” which may alert Widespread Errors (defined as “those
Data Errors or Not Data Errors affecting Cash Accounts in a Cash Account Period
at more than 100 outlets’), in the same manner as set out in Version 1.0 of this
document, which was in place under the Codified Agreement as described in
paragraphs 129 to 133 above. The procedure to be followed by Fujitsu in relation

to Widespread Errors was set out in Version 2.0 as follows:'17

a. Upon discovery of Widespread Errors, Fujitsu would “immediately notify the
[POL] Business Continuity Manager’ that it has discovered the Widespread

Error and “the action [Fujitsu] has taken or proposes should be taken...Upon

117 TPS Reconciliation & Incident Management (CS/PRO/111), FUJ00001627 (v 2.0 dated 30 April 2002)

Page 78 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

giving such notice the provisions of this document (other than this section

4.5.4) shall cease to apply in respect of those Widespread Errors”.

b. Fujitsu would notify branches which have not committed electronic Cash
accounts and which may be affected by Widespread Errors “by telephone
that they should not attempt to irrevocably commit Cash Accounts until further
notice from Fujitsu”. Fujitsu would inform POL of all electronic Cash Accounts

not transmitted as a result of the Widespread Error.

c. Fujitsu would use all reasonable endeavours “to ensure that all electronic
Cash Accounts not transmitted...as a result of Widespread Errors will
subsequently be transmitted to [POL], without correction...in order that they

will agree with the signed paper Cash Account produced in the outlet’.

d. “Where Widespread Errors have resulted in a reconciliation error within the
Cash Account [Fujitsu] will not correct any Cash Account records if this would
result in an electronic Cash Account being received by [POL] which differs

from the signed paper Cash Account produced in the outlet’.

e. Fujitsu and POL would seek to agree “reasonable additional or alternative
action by [Fujitsu]...which is appropriate for the type of Widespread Errors

discovered and the number of Outlet Cash Accounts affected by them”.

136. As noted in paragraph 68 of the Second Corporate Statement, ‘Network Banking
Reconciliation and Incident Management Procedures’ was amended in May 2005

to capture all ‘On Line Services’. At the time, these services included banking

Page 79 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

transactions, debit and credit card transactions and electronic top-up

transactions. "8

137. Version 5.0 of the TPS Reconciliation & Incident Management procedure dated 17
October 2005 appears to have contained updates in respect of Release S80, “i.e.
the removal of the cash account’. References to Widespread Errors appear to

have been removed from the CCD from this point.
HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)

138. Table A of Schedule B3.1 to the HNG-X Agreements sets out the Operational
Services which Fujitsu was required to perform, including in row 12 the
‘Reconciliation Service’. As with the Varied and Restated Agreements, this is
described as providing “end-to-end reconciliation and incident management
procedures required to investigate, report and resolve reconciliation and business

incidents”.

139. The ‘New CCD’ for the Reconciliation Service was identified in the HNG-X
Agreements as the ‘Reconciliation Service: Service Description’ (with internal
reference SVM/SDM/SD/0015) (the “HNG-X Reconciliation Service
Description’), ‘'® which replaced the CCDs set out at paragraphs 134 to 137

above in place under the Varied and Restated Agreements, when it came into

148 On Line Services Reconciliation & Incident Management (NB/PRO/002n), FUJ00120469 (v 6.0 dated
17 October 2005)

119 FUJ00079994 (v 1.0 dated 31 August 2006); FUJ00080073 (v 2.0 dated 14 July 2009); FUJ00080196
(v 3.0 dated 1 December 2010); FUJ00080254 (v 4.0 dated 3 December 2013); FUJ00003440 (v 5.0 dated
3 December 2019); FUJ00003449 (v 6.0 dated 3 June 2020); FUJ00232852 (v 7.0 dated 7 June 2022);
FUJ00235002 (v 8.0 dated 12 February 2024)

effect upon the “Commencement of HNG-X Project Workstream X4 (HNG-X
Application Rollout)’. According to this CCD, the Reconciliation Service was
provided to “ensure financial integrity across all Transactions processed” through
the system. It appears that this Service Description incorporated the specific
reconciliation and reporting requirements in respect of TPS, APS and Banking &
Related Services, previously set out in the dedicated CCDs in place under the

Varied and Restated Agreements.

140. I understand from Fujitsu’s Post Office Account team (the “POA”) that
amendments to the Reconciliation Service were agreed in commercial discussions
between POL and Fujitsu in 2016. CCN 1747, which gained final approval on 25
January 2024, removes requirements relating to (i) Branch Reconciliation, “which
had not been applicable since HNG-X Final Acceptance, after which all
Transactions are performed directly into the Data Centres and no Transaction data
is stored in Branches to be reconciled with Data Centre data’, (ii) the provision of
Manual Error Reports (“MERs”) with details of applicable liquidated damages, and
(iii) the responsibilities of the Service Desk Service, “which expired in June

2014” .120

SUMMARY OF MEASURES RELATING TO INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

141. As noted in paragraph 7 of this statement, as part of the Request, the Inquiry has

asked Fujitsu to provide a summary of the measures put in place to address the

120 CCN 1747, FUJ00234946, dated 25 September 2023; Email from D. Harvey to C. Dunford,
FUJ00232672, dated 15 November 2017; Email from M. Cornell to C. Dunford, FUJ00232671, dated 22
December 2016

Incident Management Obligations during the Relevant Period, including any
changes that have been made since 17 December 2019. The Incident
Management Obligations were primarily addressed through the provision of the
Operational Services set out above. These Operational Services were, in turn,
governed by various policies, processes and procedures. A summary of the
services relating to the Incident Management Obligations and the policies,
processes and procedures that governed their operation during the Relevant
Period is set out below. In each section, as requested by the Inquiry, reference is
made to relevant sections of the Previous Corporate Statements where
appropriate. At the Appendix to this statement, Fujitsu has prepared a table setting
out the policies, processes and procedures it has identified as applying to these

services during the Relevant Period.

142. It has been explained to me that there was an overlap in the policies, processes
and procedures relating to the Incident Management Obligations under the
Codified and Varied and Restated Agreements. For this reason, the summaries
set out below are broadly divided into the policies, processes and procedures
relating to the Incident Management under (i) the Codified and Varied and

Restated Agreements, and (ii) the HNG-X Agreements.

143. I also understand that in August 2021, Steve Browell (Chief Information Security
Officer, Fujitsu POA) created a ‘POA Improvements Log’, which was an internal
working note that he maintained to assist him to track changes being made to

service delivery across several areas. The most recent version of this log, version

Page 82 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

0.14, has fed into the summaries below.12' Version 0.11 of the POA Improvements
Log has also been disclosed to the Inquiry previously.'?? Other changes made to
the POA are described in the ‘POA Improvements List’,‘2? which was a separate
internal working document created and maintained by Mr Browell to assist him in
facilitating discussions between individuals and teams implementing changes
being made to service delivery. The first version was created on 20 July 2021 and
all available versions of the POA Improvements List are appended to this corporate

statement. 124

147. Relevant to the Incident Management Obligations, BIMS was used by Fujitsu and
POL to report the progress to resolution of ‘Business Incidents’ (as noted at
paragraph 132 above), which generally concerned reconciliation errors (e.g.,
incomplete or incorrect transactions) requiring investigation. 4? Reconciliation
errors could be caused by system faults (e.g., software bugs, system crashes or

network issues) that could then affect transactions. Where such reconciliation

errors were identified, a BIMS report would be raised by relevant teams in Fujitsu
and/or POL, and these reports would provide corrective information to assist POL
in the reconciliation or settlement process within POL’s domain. BIMS reports
provided information in relation to the resolution of the reconciliation error rather
than its underlying cause (e.g., reporting on how to fix the reconciliation issue
rather than the software bug that had caused it). Information regarding the cause
of the reconciliation error was supplied via the Problem Management Process if

the issue had been escalated.

148. Iunderstand from the POA that Fujitsu developed HORIce in around January 2012
to enable the SSC to view and collate more detailed information from various
databases on how the HNG-X systems are operating, including the Branch

Support Database.

scope of the relevant Operational Services are set out in the following sections of

150. As noted in the Second Corporate Statement and in paragraphs 86 to 100 above,

the primary aims of the Service Management Service were to monitor, manage,

maintain and report on the delivery of operational services. As with the Operational

Services, the policies and processes relating to the Service Management Service

were to be carried out in accordance with the Customer Service Policy Manual

(with internal reference CS/QMS/001),'42 Customer Service Process Manual (with

internal reference CS/QMS/002)'# and related operations manuals.'45

151. Relevant to the Incident Management Obligations, the Service Management

Service was concerned with:

a. monitoring, managing and maintaining the delivery of the operational

services, which included the first, second and third lines of support;

b. release_ management, including the release of software fixes for BEDs—

known as PinlCL (and later Peak) fixes—which were to be carried out in

152. Relevant to the Incident Management Obligations, the incident management
process in Legacy Horizon involved a number of sub-processes that were
concerned with the timing and release of software fixes. For example, the Quality
Filter Process (“QFP”) considered the assignment of target releases for test
incidents, and a QFP Forum (“QFPF”) review was required if the target release
had not been set or was inappropriate. Another example of a sub-process was the

Release Management Forum (“RMF”) which considered the assignment of target

requested. 151

153. As noted at paragraph 25 of the Second Corporate Statement and paragraphs 88
to 97 of this statement, Fujitsu and POL were contractually required to establish
the Service Management Review Forum and hold monthly ‘service review’
meetings to, amongst other things, (i) review performance against contracted
Service Levels, (ii) agree remedies payable arising from any failures to meet
Service Levels, and (iii) monitor and review operations of operational business
change processes. ‘5? Fujitsu’s compliance with the Incident Management
Obligations was primarily monitored through the Service Management Review

Forum, which is detailed further in paragraphs 210 to 215 of this statement.

HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)
Operational Services

155. During the HNG-X Agreements, the Operational Services continued to be primarily
delivered via four lines of support, which were to be carried out in accordance with
process documents formulated specifically for HNG-X, including the Incident
Management Process (with internal reference SVM/SDM/PRO/0018) 1*° and End-
to-End Application Support Strategy (with internal reference
SVM/SDM/PRO/0875).'*4 The following changes appear to have taken place in

relation to the Support Services provided under the HNG-X Agreements:

a. On 1 April 2006, the Central Network Service was formally introduced in
relation to HNG-X. This service was to ensure appropriate monitoring and
processes were in place to identify incidents within the ‘Central Telecom
Infrastructure’, which included the ‘Local Area Networks’ and ‘Wide Area

Network’; 195

b. On 1 April 2006, the Application Support Service (Fourth Line) was formally

introduced as an Operational Service in relation to HNG-X;15¢

c. On 2 July 2014, Fujitsu ceased providing the Service Desk Service and the
first line support function was transferred to Atos as part of POL’s adoption

of a towers strategy for its Horizon estate; '5”

d. On 31 March 2015, Fujitsu ceased providing the Engineering Service as

noted above at paragraphs 54 to 66 in this statement; '®® and
e. On 31 March 2018, Fujitsu ceased providing the Branch Network Service. '®®

156. Fujitsu has agreed a Data Centre Operations Service and Central Network Service
Extension with POL from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, as agreed in CCN 1732.
Changes to the agreement for these services include removing the obligation for
Fujitsu to do a full disaster recovery fail over due to the age of the service
infrastructure, although I understand from the POA that some testing is undertaken
at the component level.'® Fujitsu sought to implement this change as there is a
risk of hardware failures when powering down system components to simulate a
disaster state. Because of the age of those system components or the availability

of their support arrangements, spares required to repair such components are

limited in supply and Fujitsu considered it preferable to avoid eroding that supply

unless necessary at this late stage of the system's life cycle.

157. A further extension in respect of the Data Centre Operations Service and Central
Network Service has also now been agreed with POL from 1 April 2024 to 31
March 2025, as agreed in CCN 1749.'®' This extension was agreed on the premise
that POL will “develop a data audit solution within the Post Office Cloud to store
transaction data to replace the existing data audit solution within the Data Centres
which will avoid the need for Fujitsu Services to carry out refresh activities in the

Data Centre in this respect” by 28 February 2025.

158. During the HNG-X Agreements, the Service Management Service continued to
perform the same core functions and responsibilities in relation to the Incident
Management Obligations, which were to be carried out in accordance with process
documents formulated specifically for HNG-X, including the Release Management
Strategy (with internal reference SVM/SDM/PRO/1520).1* The following changes
appear to have taken place in relation to the Service Management Service under

the HNG-X Agreements:

a. As noted above at paragraph 35, in July and August 2014, Fujitsu’s first line
support function was transferred to Atos as part of POL’s towers strategy. As
a result of this change, the Major Account Controllers team (“MAC Team’)

was added to the Service Management Service. The MAC Team’s

responsibilities included, (i) providing a single point of contact for Atos
enquiries and escalations, (ii) being a resolution contact point for branch
logged software incidents and customer complaint handling, and (iii) trend

reporting; 1° and

b. The Business Impact Forum (“BIF”), Peak Targeting Forum (“PTF”), and
Customer Business Impact Forum (“CBIF”) were established as part of the
release management process to, amongst other things, manage the release
of software fixes. These fora continue to operate at present and further details

regarding their operation is set out below.

159. BIF and PTF are part of the release management strategy for software releases in
HNG-X. The purpose of BIF is to ensure a viable software fix has been identified,
including temporary workarounds if possible, so that the software fix can be passed
to PTF.'* If a Peak is given an approved status in BIF, the target release for the
Peak is discussed in the next PTF.'® As part of the changes made to the
management of defects, Fujitsu increased the number of BIF and PTF meetings
from weekly to daily in January 2022 to expedite the process of assigning Peaks

to releases. 1

identified at the Fujitsu BIF.1°” An example of a CBIF proposal, which details a
defect description, impact, resolution options, recommendations and implications

is exhibited to this statement. 16

161. lunderstand from the POA that from around 2021, CBIF has sought decisions from
POL on how to proceed with proposed software fixes for items identified at BIF.
This discussion on specific fixes now forms part of the wider Horizon Defect
Review (“HDR”) meeting on all branch affecting defects. Further details regarding

HDR is set out in paragraphs 162 to 164 below.
Horizon Defects Review

162. In September 2019, Fujitsu introduced the Horizon Known Error Review Forum
(the “HKERF”), also known as the Horizon Knowledge Base Review Forum, '®° the
Horizon Governance Working Group, ‘”° or the Horizon Known Errors Joint Review
Working Group by POL,‘”' to provide a forum to report branch affecting defects

raised as Incidents to POL.'’* Examples of the terms of reference, meeting

the HKERF are appended to this corporate statement. 17>

163. In early 2021, the chairmanship of the HKERF transferred to POL, at POL’s
request, and it was renamed the Horizon Defects Review (the “HDR”) in February
2021.174 By June 2021, the Terms of Reference for the HDR were updated and
formalised,*”> and weekly HDR meetings have been held since then with POL and
Fujitsu as primary attendees.'”° As of the date of this corporate statement, POL
and Fujitsu are currently discussing further updates to the terminology within HDR

Terms of Reference. 17”

164. On this basis, the purpose of the HDR has been to “track the status of every open
Defect from identification to resolution. Prioritisation will be given to any Defect
with the potential to impact a branch financially’.‘7® Reports of all branch-affecting
defects are issued to POL every week before the meetings.'”° This weekly report

takes the form of a defects tracker, which outlines a description of the defect,

proposed resolution and any branch impact. 1°° In August 2021, Fujitsu integrated

the CBIF with the HDR as the audiences for both forums were the same. 181182
POL Focused Initiatives

165. Following the Bates v POL group litigation, POL was looking to implement a
number of new initiatives. 18 Whilst this was being formulated, in March 2021,
Fujitsu created and shared with POL a POL focused ‘Postmaster First
Improvements Plan’, which I understand was a joint set of Horizon initiatives
derived from the Horizon Issues Judgment in 2019. ‘®* POL shared its own
programme plan with Fujitsu in July 2021 in which Fujitsu had a third-party support
role, '®5 and by August 2021, POL had associated some actions that Fujitsu had
been working on so that Fujitsu could interact with the programme. POL provided
Fujitsu with Requests to Quote (“RTQs”) which Fujitsu responded to using Change

Work Orders. 8° An example of a CWO is appended to this corporate statement. 18”

180 If there is a new defect with a clear branch impact, an extraordinary HDR meeting can be held to
investigate the issue and solutions if the next scheduled meeting is more than 2 working days ahead;

2022, meetings in connection with this programme were disbanded. '®&
Live Defect Management

166. From May to September 2021, Fujitsu conducted a review of its Live Defect
Management processes. From the contemporaneous briefing slides'®® and the
POA Improvements Lists*9° prepared to communicate and log the changes, the

workstreams for the improvements were categorised as follows:

a. Stream 1: Incident & problem (TfSNow, Service Now).

b. Stream 2: Peak (Incident, Defect).

c. Stream 3: Live Defect Management (Cross-functional process HDR).
d. Stream 4: Key Meetings (BIF, CBIF, HDR).

e. Stream 5: Security Improvements (Privileged Access Management, Minimum

Security Controls Framework, European Business Management System).
f. Stream 6: Elevated Processes (APPSUP, TC Tool, Interface Interactions).

g. Stream 7: Various (Investigations, Peripheral Logger, Documentation,

Governance).

statement. 19"
168. In summary, changes in respect of Live Defect Management include:

a. By the end of October 2021, Fujitsu had updated its Live Defect recording
processes with new tags to be applied if an Incident met certain criteria. For
example, if an Incident meets the criteria of a Live Defect, it must now be
recorded in Peak with the Live Affecting Defect tag applied.'% If, in addition,
there is a possibility that the issue could be affecting live branch accounts or
financial outcomes then a second “HDR” tag of “HDR-FIN” is applied.'%
Another tag of “HDR-EXP” is available for issues affecting the SPM’s

experience (i.e., the way a postmaster is required to use the system) or the

more of these tags applied will qualify for reporting to POL; 19°

b. Other new fields were added in Peak. 1% For example, POL problem
references were added to ensure that Defect Peaks are searchable. '9”
Fujitsu problem references were also added to ensure that links between
Peaks and TfSNow problems are clear and also searchable.‘ To assist
support staff and stack owners with managing the information, Fujitsu
introduced checklists and a monthly management overview of progress of
Live Defects. '°° An example of a checklist for support staff and stack owners

i. Since October 2022, HDR reporting by Fujitsu also includes all ‘Deferred Live
Defects’ (defects within Horizon that are previously approved at a release
closure meeting with POL) and ‘Project Live Defects’ (e.g., Payment and
Banking Services) which are also discussed separately in specific project

steering groups;2"1

j. From August to November 2022, a review of all KBAs was completed to
ensure that any defects identified by Fujitsu were also held in Peak and hence
subject to all the tracking, reporting, updating and controls embedded into the

systems and processes, as described above;?'? and

k. Following the KBA review, it was identified that there were some defects
which Fujitsu had not been asked to manage and rectify by POL. This led
Fujitsu to introduce a new category of ‘Accepted Live Defect’ to the defect
reporting regime which was visible to POL. This concept was implemented in

November 2022 and communicated to POL on 2 December 2022.?15

THE PRIVILEGED ACCESS OBLIGATIONS

171. I understand that access rights and privileges by employees to remedy errors in
transaction data and branch accounts forms part of the area known as ‘access

control’, an aspect of information security.

172. As with the Incident Management Obligations above, this section of the corporate
statement addresses (i) the overarching Privileged Access Obligations in place
during each of the three contractual phases previously described as set out in the
Horizon contract and relevant CCDs, (ii) the Operational Services relevant to
Privileged Access and the relevant contractual provisions surrounding those
services, and (iii) the measures in place throughout the Relevant Period to ensure

compliance with the Privileged Access Obligations.

The Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)

173. Pursuant to clause 106.10 (General Principles), Fujitsu was required to “deliver
and continue to provide a secure system in respect of all transactions which as far
as this Codified Agreement requires eliminates the potential for any fraud or
unauthorised disclosure of data and provides detection procedures and significant

barriers to attacks from internal conspiracy and collusion to defraud [POL]’.

174. Pursuant to clause 201 (Performance of Core System Services) Fujitsu was
responsible, subject to certain qualifications, for meeting POL’s requirements

specified in Schedule A15 of the Codified Agreement, in accordance with the

Page 104 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

‘Solutions’ specified in Schedule A16 by performing the ‘Core System Services’

(i.e., those services specified in clause 201.3). Of most relevance were:

a. Requirement 526 (POCL Implementation — Supporting Services: Help Desk

Resolution of Reported Incidents): It was required that “[a]// reported

Incidents shall be resolved in line with Service Levels”.

b. Requirement 698 (General — Security: Policy): Fujitsu was required to

establish “an organised security infrastructure”. This infrastructure covered,
amongst other things, the following areas: “the agreement of a security
policy... allocation of security responsibilities...security education and
training ...reporting security incidents... control of Software... safeguarding
[POL] records... compliance with data protection and other legislation...
compliance with security policy.... The management of fraud and risk during
service operation”. Fujitsu was also required to comply with British
information security standard BS7799 (“BS7799"), further detail in relation

to which is set out below.

c. Requirement 699 (General — Audit Trail): This Requirement included

various obligations, including that ‘[t]he information recorded shall be
sufficient to identify the action, by whom it was undertaken, when it was
undertaken, why it was undertaken, where it was undertaken and the

resulting outcome”.

175. Pursuant to clause 106.3 (General Principles), the POCL Services and the POCL
Infrastructure was to be provided in accordance with, and comply with, all relevant

Page 105 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

applicable industry standards, as listed in Schedule A2. Amongst other things, as
with Requirement 698, paragraph 4.1.2 of Schedule A2 (Standards) to the Codified
Agreement required Fujitsu to establish “an organised security infrastructure”.
Furthermore, paragraph 4.1.3 contained an obligation to comply with BS7799,
which was a two-part standard introduced by the British Standards Institution
(‘BSI’) in 1995. Part 1 of BS7799 was a code of practice containing
recommendations on how to develop sound information security infrastructure.
Part 2 of BS7799 was a specification focused on how to implement an information
security management system. 22° These obligations mirrored the terms of

Requirement 698 in Schedule A15.

176. In addition to the terms of the Codified Agreement, I understand from the records
available to Fujitsu that from as early as October 1996, Fujitsu and POL had
agreed a ‘Security Policy’ (a CCD with internal reference RS/POL/002).?21 The
Security Policy was said to define Fujitsu's “policy for the protection of its assets
(including hardware, applications, databases, network and documentation) against
loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability. It will also ensures compliance with

legislative and commercial requirements”.

177. The Security Policy was amended and updated from time to time. However, in
each of the approved Security Policies in place during the time of the Codified

Agreement,?2? control of access to Fujitsu’s systems and data was stated to be in

220 See paragraph 4.1.3 of Schedule A2 (Standards)

221 FY J00001266 (v 3.0 dated 8 October 1996).

222 FJ00001266 (v 3.0 dated 8 October 1996), FUJ00001294 (v 4.0 dated 30 April 1999); FUJ00232455
(v 5.0 dated 13 November 2000); FUJ00232457 (v 6.0 dated 20 November 2000); FUJ00232499 (v 7.0
dated 28 May 2002)

Page 106 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

accordance with Fujitsu’s ‘Access Control Policy’. Section 7.4 of the Security Policy

stated that the:

“Access Control Policy and its associated Security Procedures will specify:

a clear definition of responsibilities for all authorised users,

Specification of roles and responsibilities for all types of system usage,

control of access to all ICL Pathway system components,

control of access to all data within the ICL Pathway system,

control of access to all stored information and documentation,

control of access to database facilities and tools,

control of access to applications running on servers and workstations,

control of access to the network and network management systems,

procedures for allocation of access rights to IT services,

management, assignment and revocation of privileges,

mechanisms to be used for user identification and authentication,

password management, including password generation and expiry, and

monitoring system access and use of facilities.

Page 107 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

Accountability of individuals is essential and segregation of duties will be enforced
where appropriate. For particularly critical operations “two person controls” will be

considered.

Wherever authorisation is given orally, normally over a telephone link, additional

verification methods must be used”.

178. I understand from the records available to Fujitsu that the earliest identified
approved Access Control Policy (RS/POL/003) dates from April 1997225 and that
the policies in place during the time of the Codified Agreement were version 3.0
dated 18 December 1998 (which aligned with the Pathway Programme), version

4.0 dated 16 July 2002 and version 5.0 dated 28 August 2002.24

179. Versions 4.0 and 5.0 of the Access Control Policy, which relate to Legacy Horizon,
specified the following in relation to ‘Application Support’, defined as “2nd, 3rd and

4th line”:

a. “...no application support users have access to Post Office counter
systems except as allowed for [below]. Errors here are diagnosed using

logs of events extracted via Tivoli’ (section 4.5.5);

b. “All support users with access to the Post Office Account Data Centre
must do so using NT controlled workstations in a secure workstation

environment as defined in 3.3. (For SSC, the secure environment must

include a firewall to restrict traffic between the test rigs and the secure
LAN, though the workstation gives access to both Data Centres and test

rigs)” (section 4.5.5.1);

c. I Support users should have only read access to the supported systems,

except for:

e SSC support managers (not normal SSC support users)
“correcting” data under controlled conditions. (Data may need
to be corrected where it has been corrupted by faulty code.)
Correction of data must be subject to agreed authorisation

procedures...” (section 4.5.5.3);

d. In version 5.0 onwards, “Remote access to FTMS Gateways and
Counters is managed and supported using SSH client on a support

Terminal Server’ (section 4.5.5.3); and

e.  “Inall cases, updates to code or data by application support staff require
two staff to be present when the change is made and all such changes
to be audited, identifying what has been changed (before and after

values) and the individual who made the change” (section 4.5.5.4).

Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)

180. Security was specifically addressed in clause 8 of the Varied and Restated

Agreements. This clause required that Fujitsu (amongst other things):

Page 109 of 218
181.

WITN06650400
WITN06650400

a. “provide a secure system in respect of all transactions which...eliminates the
potential for any fraud or unauthorised disclosure of data and provides
detection procedures and significant barriers to attacks from internal

conspiracy and collusion to defraud Post Office” (see clause 8.1);

b. “use all reasonable endeavours to maintain the security of the Services”

(see clause 8.3); and

c. “comply with the security requirements set out in Schedule 2”

(see clause 8.3).

From at least the Varied and Restated Agreement dated 5 July 2005 (version 5.0),
clause 8.7 also included the following exclusion regarding the “accuracy,
completeness, validity or integrity of any data (including, without limitation, any

Personal Data)” relating to POL FS Data. “POL FS Data’ was defined as that data:

a. “provided by or on behalf of Post Office for loading onto the POL FS System”

(clause 8.7.1.1);

b. “produced by the Horizon Service Infrastructure and held on the POL FS

System” (clause 8.7.1.2); and

c. “contained in any Transaction Correction Record delivered by Fujitsu

Services to any Branch” (clause 8.7.1.3).

Page 110 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

182. Set outin paragraph 27 above are the general undertakings given by Fujitsu in the
Varied and Restated Agreements and which applied to the Relevant Obligations.

These undertakings are not repeated here.

183. Schedule 2 identified the policies and standards which apply to the Services

performed by Fujitsu. In particular:

a. As was the case under the Codified Agreement, Fujitsu was required,

amongst other things, to maintain “organised security infrastructure”.

b. Fujitsu was also required to be compliant with international information
security standard ISO 17799 (“ISO 17799”), the successor to Part 1 of
BS7799, which was adopted by the International Organisation for

Standardisation in around 2000.

c. Paragraph 4.1.5 also required under the heading ‘Data Security’ that “[t]he
confidentiality, integrity, validity and completeness of data shall be
maintained through all storage, processes and transmissions, including
during periods of Service Failure and recovery from Service Failure”. To the
extent that any issue with data integrity was identified, this provision would
also form part of the Incident Management Obligations whilst the problem is

investigated and resolved.

184. During the period of the Varied and Restated Agreements, the Security Policy
(RS/POL/002) remained in place, albeit it was amended from time to time. As was

the case during the time of the Codified Agreement, the Security Policy in place

Page 111 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

during the currency of the different versions of the Varied and Restated
Agreement?5 required that control of access to Fujitsu’s systems and data be in
accordance with Fujitsu’s Access Control Policy (RS/POL/003). Approved versions
of the Access Control Policy (RS/POL/003) dating from within the period of the

Varied and Restated Agreements are exhibited to this corporate statement.?26

185. In relation to the Access Control Policies (RS/POL/003) in place during the Varied
and Restated Agreements, section 4.5.5 provided further detail regarding access
controls for support staff when accessing Horizon for the purpose of Application
Support. The provisions contained in these versions of the Access Control Policy
are substantially the same as those set out above in respect of the Codified
Agreement, save that the reference to “NT controlled workstations’ in section
4.5.5.1 was replaced with “Windows controlled workstations” from version 7.0 of

the Access Control Policy dated 14 April 2005 onwards.
The HNG-X Agreements (31 August 2006 to Present)

186. In asimilar vein to the Codified Agreement and Varied and Restated Agreements,
Fujitsu was required to maintain an “organised security infrastructure” (paragraph
4.1 of Schedule A4) and, during this time, to comply with international information

security standard ISO 27001 (“ISO 27001”), the successor to Part 2 of BS7799,

(v 7.0 dated 14 April 2005)

Page 112 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

which was adopted by the International Organisation for Standardisation in around

November 2005.

187. Paragraph 4.1.3 of Schedule A4 stipulated that security for the “Services, HNG-X
Development, Associated Change Development and Equipment’ was to be
managed and organised by Fujitsu in accordance with (i) the Security Policy
(RS/POL/002), and (ii) a 'New CCD’ entitled ‘Security Management Service:
Service Description’ (SVM/SDM/SD/0017) (the “Security Management Service
Description”) when it came into effect upon the commencement of “HNG-X

Project Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout)”.22”

188. As with the Security Policy (RS/POL/002) described in this corporate statement,
the Security Management Service Descriptions (SVM/SDM/SD/0017) in place
during the period of the HNG-X Agreements also state that system access controls
were defined in the Access Control Policy (RS/POL/003). Approved versions of the
Security Management Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0017)?28 and Access
Control Policy (RS/POL/003) 22° in place within the period of the HNG-X

Agreements are exhibited to this corporate statement.

when accessing Horizon for the purpose of Application Support. The provisions
contained in this section are the same as those described in respect of version 7.0
of the Access Control Policy (RS/POL/003) described above, including the

reference to a “Microsoft controlled workstation”.

190. These provisions remained largely in place until the end of the Relevant Period.
Amendments which Fujitsu considers to be of importance to this corporate

statement appear to have been as follows:

a. The CCD entitled ‘RMGA Information Security Policy’ (SVM/SEC/POL/0003)
was introduced by CCN 129471 and effective from 27 December 2011 (the
“Information Security Policy”).2°2 This contained a further set of provisions
relating to access control. These included the following in section 11.2.4

under the ‘Privilege Management’ heading:
“The allocation and use of privileges shall be restricted and controlled.

The principle of Least Privilege means that each subject in a system
is granted the most restrictive set of privileges (or lowest clearance)

needed for their job.

The system will maintain the clearances and authorisations granted to
users, and access to information will be consistent with users’

clearances and privileges.

231 FUJ00001048, dated 15 March 2012
232 FUJ00088496 (v 5.0 dated 15 September 2009)

Page 114 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

Access to System Administration accounts will be strictly controlled.
Knowledge of the passwords and authentication for system
administrator accounts will be restricted to the authorised system

administrators.

System administrators will be allocated and use a unique identifier,
and the passwords will be subject to more frequent refresh than normal

user account standards.

The use of system administration accounts will be kept to a minimum.

Segregation of responsibilities will ensure that no privileged user can
cover up unauthorised actions, and a continuous record of all system
administration commands, and the use of powerful system utilities, will

be maintained securely”.

b. Version 5.0 of the Information Security Policy (SVM/SEC/POL/0003) was
revised in version 6.0 dated 23 January 2014.?°3 The revised Information
Security Policy did not contain an express reference to access control.
However, it referred to the ‘Post Office HNG-X Account ISMS (or Information
Security Management System) Manual (SVM/SEC/MAN/0003), 234 which
stated that every individual working with the account should comply with the

obligations set out therein, including (amongst others):

233 FUJO0002566
234 FUJ00232655 (v 5.0 dated 30 April 2014), withdrawn on 31 May 2017 (FUJ00235006)

Page 115 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

(i) “The methodology behind the granting of access must work on the
principle that access should be denied unless specifically permitted
and the principle of least privilege must apply to restrict the access

rights of users whether human or non-human” (section 11.1.1.1); and

(ii) I “The POA Security Operations Team shall undertake a monthly
review of the access granted to individuals and its continued

appropriateness” (section 11.2.2).

c. From version 10.0 of the HNG-X Agreement dated 10 September 2015

onwards:

(i) paragraph 4.1.2 of Schedule A4 required compliance with ISO 27001

“except for the Salesforce Support Service’.

(ii) paragraph 4.1.3 of Schedule A4 required “Services, HNG-X
Development, Associated Change Development and Equipment’ be
managed and organised by Fujitsu in accordance with the Security
Policy (RS/POL/002) or Information Security Policy

(SVM/SEC/POL/0003) as applicable.235

OPERATIONAL SERVICES RELATING TO PRIVILEGED ACCESS

191. As with the Incident Management Obligations addressed above, during the
Relevant Period there were a number of Operational Services that required the
use of Privileged Access to perform their functions. Most notable were the,
(i) Engineering Service, (ii) Third Line Support Service, and (iii) Reconciliation

Service, each of which are addressed in turn below:

a. Engineering Service: As noted in the context of the Incident Management
Obligations above, the Engineering Service was required under the Horizon
Engineer Service Description (CS/SER/005) and subsequently under the
HNG-X Engineering Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0002) to carry out
Transaction Recovery following communications outages through visits to
branches. This obligation remained in place from at least 31 December
20022%” to the “Trigger Point T6 (HNG-X Application Roll Out Complete)”. As
noted above, the Transaction Recovery provisions were withdrawn in version

5.0 of the HNG-X Engineering Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0002).298

b. Third Line Support Service: As noted in the context of the Incident

Management Obligations above, the Horizon Third Line Support Service
Description (CS/SER/009), required Third Line Support to recover
transactions from branches where the solution offered by the Engineering

Service was not able to be deployed.”*° This obligation was removed from

the HNG-X Third Line Support Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0004).24°
Although there was no specific reference in the relevant service descriptions
to a requirement for Third Line Support to use Privileged Access in any other
circumstance, there were references to other uses of Privileged Access in
the Access Control Policy (RS/POL/003), including the need for Third Line
Support Managers (as opposed to “normal...support users”) to correct data
under controlled conditions, in particular where the data had been “corrupted

by faulty code”.241

c. Reconciliation Service: With regards to the Privileged Access Obligations,
the Reconciliation Service CCD most relevant was the TPS Reconciliation &
Incident Management Procedure (CS/PRO/111). 742 This procedure
contained an obligation in respect of certain ‘Data Errors’ for the
Reconciliation Service to carry out data “repair”. The details of such repairs
would then be reported to POL. The correction of ‘Errors’ and ‘Exceptions’,
and the insertion of corrective transactions, was also referred to in the HNG-
X Reconciliation Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0015), however, no

specific reference was made to cash accounts.”43 In both CCDs, where it was

SUMMARY OF MEASURES RELATING TO PRIVILEGED ACCESS

192.

193.

The Privileged Access Obligations were primarily addressed through the provision
of the Security Management Service and by staff supporting specific Operational
Services who held access rights and privileges to remedy errors in transaction data
and branch accounts, including staff working on the Reconciliation Service, the
Engineering Service and the Third Line Support Service.?*4 Fujitsu is aware of
evidence which has been given in the Inquiry to date that, in certain instances,
Fujitsu specialist support staff, predominantly in Third Line Support, required
Privileged Access to perform actions necessary to remedy errors in transaction
data and branch accounts. Privileged Access was restricted to certain “application
support users” within Third Line Support and was referred to as APPSUP privileges

throughout the majority of the Relevant Period.

A summary of the Security Management Service and the policies, processes and
procedures that governed its operation during the Relevant Period is set out below.
In each section, as requested by the Inquiry, reference is made to relevant sections
of the Previous Corporate Statements where appropriate. At the Appendix to this

statement, Fujitsu has prepared a table setting out the policies, processes and

244 See, for example, the Service Descriptions for the Reconciliation Service (CS/PRO/111) at §3.17,

Engineering Service (CS/SER/005) at §3.8, and Third Line Support Service (CS/SER/009) at §3.14.

procedures it has identified as applying to these services during the Relevant

Period.

194. It has been explained to me that, as was the case with the Incident Management
Obligations, there was an overlap in the policies, processes and procedures
relating to the Privileged Access Obligations under the Codified and Varied and
Restated Agreements. For this reason, the summaries set out below are broadly
divided into the policies, processes and procedures relating to the Privileged
Access Obligations under (i) the Codified and Varied and Restated Agreements,

and (ii) the HNG-X Agreements.
Codified and Varied and Restated Agreements
Security Management

195. During the Codified and Varied and Restated Agreements, Fujitsu established the
Security Management Service*** to provide security-related activities required for
compliance with relevant standards (for example, BS7799 and ISO 27001). These
activities included establishing and maintaining an organised security
infrastructure and monitoring security-related operations. In relation to the
Privileged Access Obligations, contemporaneous documents indicate that Fujitsu
developed and/or established the following policies, processes and procedures to

establish an organised security infrastructure before the rollout of Legacy Horizon:

245 Security Management Service (CS/SER/016), FUJ00001743 (v 1.0 dated 6 January 2003);

a. Security Policy*°, which set out the roles and responsibilities for individuals,

teams and bodies in relation to the security function;

b. Access Control Policy”*’, which related to a number of requirements and
standards (for example, BS7799), and defined the policy for controlling
access to Horizon in compliance with the Security Policy, including changes
to code or data by application support staff and the use of secure workstation
environments. Details relating to the relevant content of the Access Control
Policy are provided above. Of relevance, the Access Control Policy provided
that all updates to code or data by application support staff required that two
staff be present when the change was made and all such changes were to
be audited, identifying what had been changed and the individual who made

the change.48

The HNG-X Agreements

Security Management

197. During the HNG-X Agreements, the Security Management Service?5’ continued to
provide security-related activities required for compliance with relevant standards,
which were ISO 27001 during this period. In relation to the Privileged Access
Obligations, these activities were to be carried out in accordance with policy and

procedure documents formulated specifically for HNG-X, including:

a. Information Security Policy,?5* which came to replace the Access Control

Policy;

b. — Information Security Management System (ISMS) Manual, which provided a

high-level overview of the approach and framework used within Fujitsu to

implementing, maintaining and monitoring information security; and?59

Host Branch Database Support Guide, which provided guidance for the SSC

to use the Transaction Correction Tool in the Branch Database (“BRDB’”).2°

198. While I do not have specific first-hand knowledge of the detailed technical
operation of Privileged Access to Horizon during the Relevant Period, I have been
made aware that former members of the SSC have given evidence to the Inquiry
acknowledging that (i) certain documented processes and/or procedures relating
to Privileged Access contained inaccuracies, (ii) it was possible for the SSC not to
follow the documented processes and/or procedures relating to Privileged Access
without detection, (iii) not all actions undertaken using Privileged Access were
audited and/or auditable during certain times within the Relevant Period, and (iv)
it was possible for errors to be made while using Privileged Access that could

impact financial data relating to a Post Office branch. I have also been made aware

of contemporaneous external audits that raised concerns in relation to Privileged

Access in 2011, 2012 and 2017.261
Changes to the use of access rights and privileges

199. During the first quarter of 2022, POL requested weekly reports from Fujitsu on all
access made by Fujitsu support teams to POL branch counter systems.76? The
report was to be shared by Fujitsu SecOps via HORIce each week and contain
various details of each instance of remote access, including the date and time of
the access.?63 Under approved CWO0574,?°4 weekly reports were due to be
delivered across a 3-month period .26° Under CCN 1718, it was agreed that the
provision of the report would continue as part of the Security Management

Service.?66

200. Fujitsu also considered access rights to non-BRDB databases at this time and
raised CP2831/CP7388 (Refinement of access rights to non-BRDB databases).”6”
CP2831/CP7388 was submitted in January 202276 with the intention to change
all non-BRDB default privileges for Third Line Support staff to “read only’, with
validated logging required to perform approved write-access changes (e.g.,

contractual tasks such as reconciliation and Operational Business Change, or

Changes to APPSUP.

202. On 18 October 2016 under MSC 043J0451867, Fujitsu removed the default
privilege APPSUP role from user access on BRDB and made it an on-demand,
pre-approved and controlled allocation of temporary rights.2’? This is documented

in the Data Changes Work Instruction (SVM/SDM/PRO/4293).

203. Further, in May 2021, Fujitsu implemented a new jointly defined and agreed
process with POL for APPSUP usage.?’3 The Data Changes Work Instruction

describes all scenarios under which Fujitsu may be required to amend live data.

205. On 13 May 2021, Fujitsu decommissioned the Transaction Correction Tool, with
the approval and involvement of POL, under Release 21.51.25 The Transaction
Correction Tool (also known as BRDBX015) provided “a packaged and audited
interface to run defined data correction scripts. This tool allows the Fujitsu SSC to
insert balancing records to transactional, accounting, or stock tables in the BRDB.
The tool was created as making data amendments is highly complex, requiring
many parts of the system to be amended concurrently to ensure data integrity and

avoid errors” .276
Current Position

206. Further to the changes described above, the process currently followed by Fujitsu
support staff when using Privileged Access is set out in the Data Changes Work

Instruction.2”7

207. I understand from the RA Report that “APPSUP is not used to correct branch
balance discrepancies or to amend financial transactions. Corrections relating to
branch balance discrepancies are performed by POL using the POL Transaction
Correction Process. APPSUP is used for non-balance impacting actions (such as
stock unit associations, emergency branch opening, or monthly tidying of despatch
reports). Some APPSUP actions can indirectly lead to a balance impact (such as
deleting a corrupt recovery message that is causing a logon loop). Where an action
being taken by Fujitsu using APPSUP could lead to a balance impact, it is POL
that decide if any balance discrepancy correction is required with the branch and

it is POL that take any corrective action required.”278

MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THE RELEVANT OBLIGATIONS

208. In the Request, the Inquiry has asked what, if any, internal or external measures
were put in place to monitor Fujitsu’s compliance with the Relevant Obligations
during the Relevant Period, including any changes that have been made to these

measures since 17 December 2019.

209. Fujitsu understands that its compliance with the Relevant Obligations has been

monitored primarily using the following:

a. Review and management forums involving Fujitsu and POL relating to the
performance of Horizon services, including the Service Management Review

Forum (noted above), as well as Operational Review Forums ("Operational

278 POL00030527, 26 February 2021

WITN06650400
WITN06650400

Review Forums”) and the HDR Forum, which are explained below. These
forums were supported by (i) dedicated services within Fujitsu responsible
for monitoring and/or reporting on the performance of Horizon services,
notably the Service Management Service (paragraphs 86 to 100 above) and
the Management Information Service (paragraphs 113 to 127 above), and (ii)

applications, such as HORice,’° to monitor compliance;
b. Contract governance reviews; and

c. — Internal and external audits conducted in accordance with relevant BSI, ISO,
Information Technology Infrastructure Library (“ITIL") and Industry Standard
Audit Methodology (“ISAE") standards, as described in more detail at

paragraph 220 below.
Service management and operational review forums
Service Management Review Forum

210. As noted above at paragraphs 88 to 91, Fujitsu’s performance was reported and
monitored in accordance with the governance framework established by the
Horizon contract. The Service Management Review Forum formed part of this
governance framework, and was ostensibly responsible for monitoring, evaluating

and discussing service and operational issues.

279 For example, on 19 October 2020, Fujitsu observed an internet connectivity issue affecting network
traffic. The issue was affecting all Fujitsu POA services using the internet. The Fujitsu Network Operations
Centre Major Incident Management Team investigated the issue. Fujitsu POA raised multiple high priority
incidents for the affected services from 4:28pm. Around 5:30pm, the connection began to be restored and
affected services started to recover. The SMC monitored the recovery using HORIce; FUJ00232704

As noted in paragraphs 88 to 97 above, the Service Management Review Forum
was a monthly meeting attended by representatives of Fujitsu and POL during the
Relevant Period. Its composition, role and responsibilities under the Varied and

Restated Agreements were set out as follows:

a. “Review performance against contracted service levels and agree remedies

payable (if any)”;

b. “Track MTBF [Mean Time Between Failure]’ rates, review operational
reliability of Branch Infrastructure and consider/recommend remedial courses

of action (e.g., full or partial technological refresh or service level relief)”;

c. “Resolve operational issues including, but not limited to those arising from

non-conformance to contracted service levels”;

d. “Release Authorisation: agree the criteria and processes by which releases
would be authorised for release into field trial or live operation and carry out

readiness reviews accordingly’;

e. “Ensure continuous improvement in the ongoing/steady state/business as

usual Service Management environment’;

f. “Review of future change plans to ensure live environment is adequately

prepared”;

g. “Capacity management’; and

WITN06650400

h. “Monitor and review operations of Operational Business Change

processes’ .280

According to the Varied and Restated Agreements, attendees from POL would
include the Head of Network Support, the Supplier and Service Performance
Manager, and the Commercial Manager. Fujitsu attendees would include the
Customer Service Director and the Infrastructure Service Manager. 28" I also
understand from the POA that the stated purpose and attendees of the Service
Management Review Forum (by reference to their roles) did not change during the

period Legacy Horizon was operational.?6?

It appears that by October 2010, the format of the Service Management Review
Forum changed.?® At least by 2013, the Service and Commercial Review was
discharging similar functions to the Service Management Review Forum. Its terms

of reference are recorded as being:

a. “Ensuring continuous improvement in the service management environment

through pro-active management.”

b. “Reviewing Operational Services performance, including against agreed
Service Levels and agreeing remedies payable (if any) in accordance with

the relevant terms of this Agreement.”

c. “Reviewing network performance.”

d. “Reviewing operational reliability of Infrastructure, tracking MTBF rates and
considering/recommending remedial courses of action (e.g., full or partial

technological refresh or Service Level relief).”

e. “Resolving operational issues including, but not limited to, those arising from

non-conformance to agreed Service Levels.”

f. “Reviewing future change plans to ensure the live environment is prepared

for Operational Services.”

g. “Capacity management in relation to Service Management Services.”

h. “Monitoring Operational Business Change processes.”2®4

214. As noted above at paragraphs 91, 120 and 124, the primary input into the Service
Management Review Forum was the Service Management Report, which was a
report prepared by the Management Information Service that reported on the
performance of certain Operational Services provided under the Horizon

contract.?85 As with the review and reporting framework, the precise structure and

284 FUJ00174800

285 Fujitsu was required to “prepare the necessary reports for discussion” at the Service Management
Review Forum meetings. Management Information Service (CS/SER/015), FUJ00120479 (v 1.0 dated 20
December 2002), FUJ00001910 (v 2.0 dated 18 November 2004), FUJ00001965 (v 3.0 dated 8 July 2005)

Page 133 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

content of the Service Management Report changed during the Relevant Period.
Based on the contemporaneous documents that have been identified to date, there
appears to have been three major iterations of the Service Management Report,

which were titled as follows:

a. ‘Service Review - Performance Statistics’, which appear to have been

produced between 1997 and 2002;786

b. ‘Service Review Book’, which appear to have been produced between 2002

and 2010;287 and

c. ‘Service Management Review / Service & Commercial Review’ meeting
packs, which comprised of multiple documents and appear to have been

produced from 2010 onwards.?8

215. Whilst the content and format of the Service Management Reports changed during
the Relevant Period, the Service Management Reports do seem from the available
records to have been produced and circulated in advance of the monthly Service
Management Review Forum meeting and typically contained information, data and
statistics in relation to the performance of the Operational Services, including in

relation to Service Level Agreements/Targets, problem and incident management,

286 See, for example, FUJ00058221 and FUJ00058213, and other documents disclosed to the Inquiry with
internal reference CS/PER/013

call volumes to the Service Desk and business management issues (e.g., BIMS

reports).289
Operational Review Forums

216. The Service Management Review Forum was supported by monthly Operational
Review Forums that were each responsible for reviewing the performance of a
specific service and any related operational issues, including relevant Service

Level Agreements and operational level agreements.2°

217. I understand that the Operational Review Forums were typically attended by
representatives of Fujitsu and POL,?9' who were expected to (i) report on the
overall performance of the specific part of the service, (ii) identify and record
associated risks, issues and problems with the service, (iii) offer informed opinions
on the service which could be escalated and understood by the Service
Management Review Forum, and (iv) deliver delegated and/or escalated actions
and ensure results were communicated to the Service Management Review

forum.?92

218. Based on the contemporaneous documents identified to date, there were several

Operational Review Forums that reported to the Service Management Review

289 See, for example, FUJ00152274, FUJ00225029 and FUJ00232673.

FUJ00232448, and ‘OBC Branch Operational Review Terms of Reference’ (v 0.4 dated 17 September

Forum, including the (i) Helpdesk Forum, (ii) Problem Management Operational

Review Forum, and (iii) Incident Review and Exception BIMS Forum.29%
Other joint customer review meetings

219. In addition to the Service Management Review Forum and Operational Review
Forums noted above, I understand from the POA that Fujitsu and POL have more
recently established joint customer review meetings to allow for additional and
more frequent management of the Operational Services, which include (i) a
‘Weekly Priority Call’, which was established in December 2021 and ended in
December 2023, and (ii) a ‘Hot Topics’ forum, which was established in August

2022.94 These forums are not required under the HNG-X Agreements.
Internal and External Audits

220. In addition to the forums noted above at paragraphs 208 to 218, it has been
explained to me that Fujitsu’s compliance with the Relevant Obligations were
monitored through internal and external audits conducted to the following industry

standards:
a. ISO 9001, which concern ‘general quality’;

b. BS7799, ISO 17799 and ISO 27001, which concern security;

c. BS 1500 and ITIL, which concern problem and incident management; and

d. ISAE 3402, which concern financial statements and reporting, and

associated processes.

221. The standards listed above at paragraph 220 appear to cover a wide range of
topics, however, those most pertinent to the Relevant Obligations appear to

include:

a. Security, incident and problem management;29
b. I Security awareness training;2%

c. Privilege management;29”

d. Quality management;2°° and

e. Customer service.?°

222. For example, on 20 August 2020, POL wrote to Fujitsu to request an audit of the
Horizon services.* It was agreed that Fujitsu would prepare a set of audit reports.

From January to March 2021, Fujitsu delivered six reports on its working practices:
a. ‘SDLC Report’ (with internal reference COM/MGT/REP/4168);°°"
b. ‘Testing & QA Report’ (with internal reference COM/MGT/REP/4166);302

Contract Governance Reviews

223. Fujitsu conducts reviews of the governance of the Horizon contracts regularly,
including in January 2021 ,°°7 June 2022,%°8 and September 2022.5°9 As a result of
such reviews, Schedule A2 (Relationship and Governance) was updated in July
2023, 31° and Fujitsu has mapped its contractual requirements to ensure
compliance with its obligations, including updating details of the HDR in Schedule
A2 (Relationship and Governance)."! Changes to Schedule A2 (Relationship and
Governance) are discussed with POL at monthly contractual governance review
meetings, attended by, amongst others, Daniel Walton; an example of which is

appended to this corporate statement.3!2
FINANCIAL PENALTIES

224. The Request further asks whether Fujitsu incurred any financial penalties between
1 January 2000 and 16 December 2019 as a result of non-compliance with the

Relevant Obligations.

225. The contractual structure pursuant to which liability for financial compensation
could be incurred by Fujitsu during this period is set out below. I understand that

this contractual structure is not limited to the Relevant Obligations, and liability for

WITN06650400
WITN06650400

financial compensation could be incurred by Fujitsu in relation to other contractual

provisions which fall outside the subject-matter of this corporate statement.

226. Where liability was incurred by Fujitsu, it appears that payment was generally
made by way of credit note, which would be offset against the charges payable by
POL. While Fujitsu has identified a number of documents relating to the provision
of credit notes to POL, which have been provided to the Inquiry with this corporate
statement, I understand there are limitations to this data. In particular, (i) Fujitsu’s
financial records relating to the Post Office account prior to 2003 do not appear to
be complete, (ii) in some instances, the records held appear to be duplicative and
it is not possible to identify which is the final version without a forensic accounting
investigation and also supporting witness evidence, and (iii) as indicated above, it
is not the case that all credit notes relate to the payment of financial compensation
for non-compliance with the Relevant Obligations. As a result, it has not been
possible in the time available to identify from the available documentation, for each
credit note, the specific incident which gave rise to the credit note or whether these

incidents related to non-compliance with the Relevant Obligations.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELEVANT TO FINANCIAL PENALTIES

227. The provision of services by Fujitsu under the Horizon contract was measured
against ‘Service Levels’ and ‘Service Level Agreements’, defined as “quantified

and measurable” standards.*'3 To the extent relevant thresholds within certain

313 Codified Agreement, Schedule A01 (Interpretation); Varied and Restated Agreements, Schedule 1
(Interpretation); HNG-X Agreements, Schedule 1 (Interpretation)

Page 140 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

‘Service Levels’ and ‘Service Level Agreements’ were not met, POL was entitled
to liquidated damages. Further detail regarding POL’s entitlement to liquidated
damages in respect of the Operational Services most relevant to the Incident
Management Obligations and Privileged Access Obligations is set out in the

Appendix to this corporate statement.
The Codified Agreement (28 July 1999 to 30 December 2002)3"4

228. The main contractual provisions in the Codified Agreement relating to the payment
of compensation by Fujitsu to POL where the provision of services fell below
applicable Service Levels included clause 802 (Service Credits and Delay).Clause
802 noted that, in the event that Service Levels in respect of services specified in
the clause were not achieved, Fujitsu was required to (i) credit POL with Service
Credits (defined as “Payment, discount or credit given by the Contractor to [POL]
resulting from a delay in provision of POCL Services, or from POCL Services’
failure to meet the required Service Levels”)°'> as an adjustment to the charges
payable by POL under the Codified Agreement, or (ii) pay POL liquidated
damages. The calculations for Service Credits and liquidated damages were set
out in the relevant Schedules. The services specified in clause 802 do not appear

to relate to the Relevant Obligations.

229. In addition to the above, pursuant to clauses 210.2 and 301.10.2 of the Codified

Agreement, Fujitsu bore responsibility for the costs of further releases “from time

to time as necessary to remedy defects in the provision of the contractual

services.

Varied and Restated Agreements (31 December 2002 to 15 August 2006)°15

230. Fujitsu was also required under the Varied and Restated Agreements to
compensate POL for loss or damage incurred as a result of the provision of
services by Fujitsu falling below applicable Service Levels. The relevant provisions

are identified below:

a. Clause 9.2.4: Provided that “the Services shall be performed in accordance
with all applicable service levels’. The applicable Service Levels were

contained in Schedule 15.

b. Clause 29 — Liquidated Damages and Post Office Additional Cost: In the

event that Fujitsu’s services failed to meet the Service Levels contained in
Schedule 15, Fujitsu was required to pay POL liquidated damages (“a
reasonable and genuine pre-estimate of the loss likely to be suffered” by POL
per clause 29.4) and ‘Post Office Additional Costs’ (as defined in Schedule
15) in the form of credit notes. Liquidated damages were “a reasonable and

genuine pre-estimate of the loss likely to be suffered” by POL (clause 29.4).

c. Schedule 15 (Service Levels and Remedies): Schedule 15 described three

Service Level thresholds:

meanings given to them in the Varied and Restated Agreements

Page 142 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

(i) the level of service (“Service Level Target” or “SLT”) required from
Fujitsu by POL. Not all SLT failures gave rise to payment of liquidated

damages.

(ii) the level of service which, if not achieved by Fujitsu, gave rise of
payment of liquidated damages by Fujitsu (the “Liquidated Damages

Threshold” or “LDT”)

(iii) The level of service (below the SLT and the LDT) which, if not
achieved, would give rise to payment by Fujitsu of Post Office
Additional Costs or liquidated damages (Additional Remedy Level (or
“ARL”). Post Office Additional Costs were defined in Schedule 1 as
“in respect of the ARL failure in question, [POL]'s reasonable
additional direct costs and expenses arising as a result of that ARL
failure including, without limitation, [POL]’s additional direct staff, help

desk and telephone costs”).

All Service Levels were to be monitored on a weekly and monthly basis, and
failure to meet Service Levels were required to be reported by Fujitsu to POL
in a Service Review Book. The Annexes to Schedule 15 defined Service

Level thresholds for the following groups of services:

Page 143 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

(i) I Support Desk Services*"’ (this included the following Operational
Services: Engineer Service; Horizon Helpdesk Services and

Technical Service Desk Service);
(ii) I Data Delivery Services;3"®
(iii) I Banking Services;3'9 and
(iv) Miscellaneous Services (including Data Errors).3°

231. The calculation of credit notes in respect of the abovementioned Service Levels is

set out in the Annexes to Schedule 15.

232. In addition to the above, pursuant to clause 6.2 of the Varied and Restated
Agreements, Fujitsu “may issue further Releases of Software...from time to time
as necessary to remedy defects in the provision of the contractual services.
Clause 10 of the Varied and Restated Agreements defined the Charges payable
by POL in relation to the services provided by Fujitsu. It is unclear without
exhaustively examining what comprised the Charges whether the costs of such
releases were required to be borne by Fujitsu or POL. Fujitsu intends to continue
its analysis of the Charges to ascertain this information for the Inquiry but
regrettably this analysis has not been completed at the time of preparing this

corporate statement.

HNG-X Agreements (15 August 2006 to 31 December 2019)°2"

233. The HNG-X Agreements also contained obligations for Fujitsu to compensate POL
for loss or damage incurred as a result of the provision of ‘HNG-X Services’ by
Fujitsu falling below applicable Service Levels. The relevant provisions are

identified below:

a. Clause 17 — Service Levels: The HNG-X Services provided by Fujitsu were
to achieve the Service Levels in Schedule C1 (Service Level Principles and

Remedies).

b. Clause 18 (Service Level Remedies): In the event that the Services failed to

meet the Service Levels in Schedules C1 or B4.4 (Existing Service Levels),
Fujitsu was required to pay POL liquidated damages (in the form of credit
notes, unless POL directed otherwise) calculated in accordance with

Schedule C1 or Schedule B4.4.

c. The specified HNG-X Services to which financial compensation applied

under Schedules C1 and B4.4 included:

(i) Support Desk Services (This included the following Operational
Services: Engineer Service; Horizon Helpdesk Services and

Technical Service Desk Service);322

were to be monitored on a weekly and monthly basis, and failure to meet
Service Levels was required to be reported by Fujitsu to POL by means of a

Service Review Book (Schedule B4.4).

234. In addition to the above, pursuant to clause 12.2 of the HNG-X Agreements, Fujitsu
“may issue further Releases of Software...from time to time as necessary to
remedy defects in the provision of’ the contractual services. Clause 21 of the HNG-
X Agreements defined the Charges payable by POL in relation to the services
provided by Fujitsu. It is unclear without exhaustively examining what comprised
the Charges whether the costs of such releases were required to be borne by
Fujitsu or POL. Fujitsu intends to continue its analysis of the Charges to ascertain
this information for the Inquiry but regrettably this analysis has not been completed

at the time of preparing this corporate statement.

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES MECHANISMS

235. In the course of preparing this corporate statement, Fujitsu has identified

mechanisms, set out in paragraphs 237 to 262 below, which exemplify some of the

323 HNG-X Agreements, Schedule B4.4, Annex 2
324 HNG-X Agreements, Schedule B4.4, Annex 3
325 HNG-X Agreements, Schedule B4.4, Annex 4

Page 146 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

ways in which liability for liquidated damages were incurred and/or reported to POL
during the period 1999 to 2019. Details are provided below by way of example
(with references to supporting documentation) of specific incidents giving rise to
the payment of compensation, the process for agreeing with POL the quantum of

such compensation and the payment of that compensation.

236. In addition to the below, the Inquiry is referred to paragraphs 60 to 63 of the Third
Corporate Statement regarding the commercial resolution and closure of PinICL

PC0066318.

Service Levels

237. It follows from paragraphs 227 to 233 above that, under the Horizon contract, (i) if
the level of service provided by Fujitsu fell below the agreed threshold in respect
of certain services, Fujitsu would be liable to pay liquidated damages to POL, (ii)
payments for liquidated damages where the relevant Service Level thresholds
were not met were to be in the form of credit notes, unless otherwise elected by
POL, and (iii) the calculation of liquidated damages was dependent on the
particular service being provided. Where applicable, the relevant contractual
provisions relating to the payment of liquidated damages for non-compliance with

the Relevant Obligations are set out in the Appendix to this corporate statement.

238. As set out in paragraphs 88 to 91 and 209 to 217 of this corporate statement,
Fujitsu's performance against Service Levels was reported in the Service
Management Report, which fed into the Service Management Review Forum. In
some cases, this included an update on penalties incurred by Fujitsu.

Page 147 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

239. For example, the Service Management Report for March 2003 referred to penalties
incurred in respect of the Engineering Service. For reference, the SLTs in respect
of the Engineering Service for which liquidated damages applied at this point in
time were set out in paragraph 2.1 of Annex 1 to Schedule 15 of the Varied and
Restated Agreements. The Service Review Book for March 2003 stated that “[t]he
Engineering service penalties have decreased dramatically this month (circa
£24,000) All local, intermediate and remote Service Level Targets for both A and
B priority calls were met in March, and the Engineering Service also achieved at
least 97.9% on all penalty thresholds in all categories. The time to repaid target

was failed however (average 29% of downtime, against 24.5% of time allowed” 526

240. By way of further example, the minutes of the Service Management Review Forum
held on 22 November 2000 record discussion of various payments and reporting
of remedies: “Liz Tuddenham explained that PON is now in a position to agree
March Hardware and Netware figures of £51091.90 and confirmed that the BIMS
figure for the quarter ending August 2000 is agreed as £27900.00. Paul Westfield
expressed concern about the time taken to clear the backlog and Liz explained
that an adjustment factor principle has now been agreed which should speed up
the resolution of these figures. Richard Brunskill and Liz Tuddenham agreed to
work closely to get the remedies standardised and sorted out. After some
discussion it was agreed to issue a credit note for the quarter ending August 2000
subject to any adjustments, by either PON or ICL Pathway, arising from the

checking of remedies. (see AP001107). Richard also produced a summary report

326 FUJ00232540
Page 148 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

of remedies which he will amend to detail the adjustments and continue to supply

on a monthly basis for each HSRF.”527

Major Incidents

241. From at least 2006, it appears that liquidated damages were payable by Fujitsu in

respect of certain Major Incidents.

242. According to the ‘POA Customer Service Major Incident Process’ (with internal
reference SVM/SDM/PRO/0001), Major Incidents were defined as incidents which
resulted in business being stopped, i.e. “a Post Office down, unable to process any
business, or central system failure which will result in a number of Post Offices
being unable to process work’ (severity level A Incidents), 578 or “a series of
connected lower severity rated Incidents which combine to have a significant
business impact’ .°?° In particular, liquidated damages were incurred in relation to
Major Incidents which constituted an event or series of connected events causing
one or more counters to be unavailable due to a network wide or local failure
(‘Failure Events”). The calculation of liquidated damages in respect of such
Failure Events was by reference to the Counter Availability SLT,*°° and required

agreement between POL and Fujitsu (via the Customer Service Manager Support

Unit (“CS MSU”) Major Incident Review) regarding the number of branches

impacted by, and the duration of, the Major Incident.3%"

243. The ‘POA Customer Service Major Incident Process’ also stipulated that
information relating to Major Incidents should be recorded in Major Incident

Reports, which were distributed to POL,*°? and Service Review Books.%34

244. For example, the Major Incident Report in respect of “transaction timeouts across
the whole POCL infrastructure" for Debit Card and ETU services on 8 February
2006 set out (i) a description of the incident, (ii) the scale of the impact and actions
taken by Fujitsu in response to the incident, (iii) associated HSD and PEAK
references, and (iv) the duration of the incident.°*4 As a consequence of this
incident, there was “a total of 23819 DCS and 31464 ETU transaction failures” 33°
The minutes of the Horizon Service Management Forum from 24 April 2006 include
a closed Action Point in relation to the “E-top up problem", which was to “ensure
that the compensation figure identified by FS has been ratified by POL”. A credit
note for £162,760 (plus VAT) was subsequently issued on 21 July 2006, with the

service description “E-Top Up Incident Credit’ .5°°

245. Depending on their nature, duration and frequency, it appears that Major Incidents
did not always incur liquidated damages if, for example, Service Levels were still

met, or liquidated damages did not apply to certain Service Levels.°5”
BIMS

246. As explained in paragraphs 73 to 75 of the Second Corporate Statement, BIMS
reports were raised to log Business Incidents, defined in relevant Service
Descriptions as a “symptom of an underlying cause — e.g., the effect of the system
fault on the resulting reconciliation or settlement information sent to [POL]”. BIMS

reports were designed to report the progress of a Business Incident to resolution.

247. The CCDs in place in respect of the Reconciliation Service from 31 December

2002 (set out in paragraph 134 above) broadly provided for the following:

a. Fujitsu was required to run a variety of reconciliation reports on a daily basis
for EPOSS/TPS, Network Banking, APS, and the direct debit service. Within
these reconciliation reports, Fujitsu was to identify errors which constituted

‘Business Incidents’ and ‘System Incidents’.

b. Business Incidents were then reported to POL through BIMS, which could be

supplemented, if necessary, by a Manual Error Report (‘MER’).

248. According to the ‘CS Infrastructure Services Operations Manual’ (with internal

reference CS/QMD/006), the CS MSU would meet with POL to agree, on a monthly

387 See for example, document tiled "Commercial Guidance - Applicability of Liquidated Damages to the
Red Alert that occurred on 27/07", FUJ00232650, dated 2 August 2011

Page 151 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

basis, the level of compensation to be paid by Fujitsu in respect of missing or
erroneous transactions, and/or Major Incidents.*°° Such charges would usually be

in the form of MERs and would be applied via credit notes.*°9

249. Further, the ‘SLA Performance Remedy and Business Incident Payments Process’
(with internal reference CS/PRD/087) stated that the CS MSU was “responsible
for calculating payments in respect of business incidents which under the terms of
the contract attract charges. The majority of business incidents attracting charges
will be identified from TPS Reconciliation Reports and will be raised by CS MSU,
whilst others may be generated by [Fujitsu] SSC or [POL]. Manual Error Reports
will be completed for these business incidents. Once notified of the payments due
by CS MSU, [Fujitsu] Finance Department is responsible for raising credit notes in
respect of these payments”.*° The process for preparing MERs from the BIMs
database appears to have been set out in the document titled ‘Manual Error Report

—Liquidated Damages Costs’ .541

250. According to the ‘Business Incident Management Service High Level Design’ (with

internal reference TD/DES/129):

a. “the transaction (MER) amount for an incident is to be calculated as the sum

of the transaction costs for the incident’; and

Page 152 of 218
WITN06650400
WITN06650400

b. “all incidents cleared in a given month where a manual error report contains
chargeable errors” were listed in a BIMS Charging Detail Report, which set
out, amongst other information, the “number and value of transactions that

generated the charge” .*42

251. By way of example, the BIMS Charging Detail Report for February 2010 included
“chargeable errors’ relating to (i) “APS Reconciliation Error’ whereby a “system
bug caused duplicate transactions where the Session ID was used twice” valued
at £126.50, and (ii) a Receipts and Payments mismatch relating to a “Known
system issue where Fastcash and Settle buttons both pressed’, valued at
£150.00.543 The BIMS Charging Detail Reports identified by Fujitsu to date have

been produced to the Inquiry with this corporate statement.

252. If agreement could not be reached between the CS MSU and POL, then a Case
Law Referral (see paragraphs 261 to 262 below) would be completed for Fujitsu’s

Commercial team to discuss and agree a solution with POL’s Commercial team.*44

253. The Accounting & Reconciliation Review Forum (“ARRF”) (renamed TIP
Operational Review Forum in 2001 (“TORF”)) met monthly from 1999 until 2002 to
conduct a review of liabilities and the performance of the CS MSU in respect of

incident handling and resolutions.*4° These reviews were recorded in CS MSU

Manual Error Reports

254. Pursuant to the ‘Data Errors & Not Data Errors — Contractual Definitions’ (with
internal reference CS/SER/017), Fujitsu was liable to pay liquidated damages in

respect of POL’s “costs in dealing with” MERs.*47

255. By clause 6 of the Third Supplemental Agreement, Fujitsu and POL agreed to
amend paragraph 3.6 of Schedule G01 of the Codified Agreement in the manner
set out in Schedule 5 to the Third Supplemental Agreement. In particular, this
amended the definition of Data Error and required Fujitsu to issue a MER to POL
in respect of any Data Error. The MER was required to describe the Data Error
and specify either (i) the line items in the relevant cash account requiring
replacement (in the case of a Data Error resulting in a Cash Account Error) or (ii)
the relevant Transaction record as it would have appeared but for the Data Error
(in the case where a Data Error was a Transaction Error). According to the ‘Data
Errors & Not Data Errors — Contractual Definitions’, Fujitsu was required to use all
reasonable endeavours to ensure that a MER was issued within five working days

of the occurrence or detection of a Data Error.*48 Fujitsu was also required to

compensate POL “for its costs in dealing with’ MERs on a monthly basis, as

follows:

a. In relation to a Transaction Error, £150 if the error was discovered after
transmission of the relevant record to POL, or £100 if the error was

discovered before transmission;
b. £100 per MER relating to a Cash Account Error; and
c. £100 per MER relating to an Inaccurate Cash Account (Data Error).54°

256. To the extent a Data Error was corrected by Fujitsu within five working days of its

occurrence, no payment was required to be made by Fujitsu.%°°

257. From 31 August 2006, Fujitsu’s recording and reporting obligations were set out in
the ‘Reconciliation Service: Service Description’ (with internal reference

SVM/SDM/SD/0015).351

258. Under the HNG-X Agreements, Fujitsu was liable to pay liquidated damages to

POL in respect of MERs, as follows:

a. £100 per transaction which “can not [sic] be delivered to the POL FS System
by electronic means and has been discovered by the Reconciliation Service

before it was due to be sent to POL FS”; and

WITN06650400
WITN06650400

b. £150 per transaction which “can not [sic] be subsequently re-delivered to the
POL FS System by electronic means following rejection by the POL FS

System” 352

259. Fujitsu was not liable to pay liquidated damages in respect of transactions that
were “lost due to events of Force Majeure, or error by Branch office staff’ °°? The
calculation of liquidated damages due to POL would be prepared by the
Reconciliation Service and forwarded to POL for agreement on a monthly basis.
According to the HNG-X Reconciliation Service Description, the purpose of
liquidated damages in respect of MERs was that “[POL] shail not be disadvantaged
by failures of [Fujitsu] to provide electronic transmission of Transaction information

to the POL FS System”.9°

260. As noted in paragraph 140 above, I understand that changes to the requirements
of the Reconciliation Service, including in relation to MERs, were agreed in 2016

and were put on a contractual footing by CCN 1747.356

Case Law Referrals

261. Case Law Referrals were a mechanism used by Fujitsu between 2000 and 2001
to escalate disputes regarding BIMs and/or MER compensation. In accordance

with the ‘Benefit Payment End to End Reconciliation Process for ICL Pathway

CS/PRD/036), Case Law Referrals were “introduced in order to provide a
comprehensive log of all reconciliation incident types which can act as the legal

precedent for any future incidents of an identical nature” 35”

262. Fujitsu has so far identified six Case Law Referrals which resulted in compensation

being paid by Fujitsu to POL, as set out below.

a. Case Law Referral 0001 was first raised on 25 February 2000 in relation to
“APS transactions incorrectly processed due to issue with barcode reader’
(BIMS reference 0002250287). *5* According to the Case Law Referral,
Fujitsu accepted liability for £3800, which POL disputed - under POL’s
calculations, Fujitsu was liable for £7,650. This dispute appears to have been
resolved, with compensation for the incident reflected in the March 2000 MER

figure, under a credit note for £5,400.959

b. Case Law Referral 0004 was first raised on 22 March 2000, in relation to
a “transaction for an unknown mode” (BIMS reference 0003221771,
0003290920).3°° Case Law Referral 0005 was also first raised on 22 March
2000 in relation to a “Receipts and Payments misbalance post migration”
(BIMS reference 003240681). °6' According to the Case Law Referrals,
Fujitsu did not accept any financial liability for either of the incidents. °°

Fujitsu’s position in relation to Case Law Referrals 0004 and 0005 was set
out in a letter from Colin Lenton-Smith (Commercial and Finance Director,
Fujitsu) to Keith Baines (Service Manager, POL) on 25 October 2001.5° In
particular, Mr Lenton-Smith stated that the incidents “set a precedent in their
uniqueness and cases of this kind have not been seen before’. Fujitsu
proposed to share liability for the incidents with POL “on a 50/50 basis, with
a payment of £9,075.00 being made by [Fujitsu]”. Mike Hannon (Horizon
Commercial and Contract Team Leader, POL) responded to Mr Lenton-
Smith’s letter on 16 July 2002, and stated that POL “believe[s] that [Fujitsu]
have not been strictly following the agreed process for TIP interface, and
therefore if this had been adopted there [sic] would not have occurred, in
these instances we consider [Fujitsu] should bear the whole of the costs”.°®4
Mr Lenton-Smith responded on 13 September 2002, that “/ just do not
understand how the TIP interface process would have prevented these
instances from occurring as you suggest. At this time, Fujitsu... is still
prepared to offer a payment of £9,075 in respect of [Case Law Referrals 0004
and 0005]”.5®° According to an email from Claire Wadeson (Finance Team,
Fujitsu) to John Moran (CS MSU Manager, Fujitsu) copying Mr Lenton-Smith,
dated 20 May 2003, Case Law Referrals 0004 and 0005 were settled for

£9,075, paid in the form of Credit Note 0301244366

c. Case Law Referral 0007 was first raised on 8 November 1999 in relation to
duplicated and missing AP transactions.°*” The Case Law Referral stated
that Fujitsu and POL agreed that any commercial settlement should “be made
only for the face value of the transaction that is deemed non recoverable".
This was stated in Mr Lenton-Smith’s letter of 25 October 2001 to be
£5,156.60 but “should the value be subsequently recovered by [POL] from
the client, then this would be refunded to [Fujitsu]”.°6° According to Mr
Hannon’s letter dated 16 July 2002, POL accepted Fujitsu's “proposal to pay
£5,160 (the [sic] transaction face value of the incidents)” but did not agree to
refund Fujitsu should POL subsequently recover the value from elsewhere.
This was because “we believe [Fujitsu] [sic] responsibilities include the
reconciliation of errors, the failure to do so has caused additional
administrative problems for POL, therefore if any amounts were recovered
from clients these would be retained by POL to defray these additional
costs” .56° Agreement appears to have been reached and settlement was paid
by Fujitsu in the form of Credit Note 0209118,%”° along with Case Law

Referral 0008.37"

d. Case Law Referral 0008 was first raised on 8 February 2001 in relation to

swapped out (BIMS reference BE/0102081734). %’2 It appears from
correspondence between Mr Lenton-Smith and Mr Hannon that Fujitsu
proposed to pay £4,402.03 in relation to this incident. This was paid in the

form of Credit Note 02091 18,°73 along with Case Law Referral 0007.34

e. Case Law Referral 0009 was first raised on 8 November 2001 in relation to
an OBCS encashment failure which resulted in postmasters being unable to
scan or manually input pension books into Horizon between 06:00 and 11:15
am (the “Pension Book OBCS Failure”).°”° The ‘Pension Book MBCI (8*
November 2001) Report’ provides a summary of the incident, the applicable
related issues, and Fujitsu's actions to prevent a recurrence.%’° It appears
from correspondence between Fujitsu and POL that agreement regarding
financial compensation for the Pension Book OBCS Failure was not reached

until early 2003.97? In particular:

(i) In a letter dated 14 December 2001 from Mr Baines to Mr Lenton-
Smith, POL’s determination of the loss for which Fujitsu was liable
was stated to be £22,236.36 (comprising of lost income of £5,867.11

(ii) I On 19 December 2001, Martin Riddell (Service Delivery Director,
Fujitsu) shared a copy of the ‘Pension Book MBCI (8 November
2001) Report’ with Mr Lenton-Smith, adding “[a]s you can see from
the report there were some issues in the time it took for [POL] to carry
out [appropriate] agreed actions such as updating the IVR and then
the issues around the suitability of the IVR. We obviously need to

understand from Keith [Baines] the origin of the additional costs”.3’°

(iii) I On 18 January 2002, Mr Lenton-Smith responded to Mr Baines’ letter,
noting that POL and Fujitsu agreed at the December 2001 Service
Review Forum that the Pension Book OBCS Failure be handled as a
Case Law Referral and enclosing a copy of Case Law Referral
0009.%8° On 4 February 2002, an update appears to have been added
by Fujitsu to the Case Law Referral, noting that further detail had

been sought relating to POL’s liability calculation.°*'

(iv) On 6 February 2003, Mr Lenton-Smith emailed Richard Brunskill
(Infrastructure Services Manager, Fujitsu) regarding ‘OBCS Failure’,

seeking an update on “our dispute of the £20,524.13 that [POL] are

claiming” .*®2 Mr Brunskill replied that he was “still trying to get a
sensible answer out of [POL]", and Mr Lenton-Smith asked for an
update by 18 February 2003, in advance of the next Commercial

Forum.%83

(v) I Minutes of the Commercial Forum meeting held on 19 February 2003
record as an action item, “[POL] will respond to Fujitsu regarding the
outstanding OBCS compensation claim” .°*4 On 28 February 2003, Mr
Baines wrote to Mr Lenton-Smith proposing to accept £14,657.02 as
settlement in respect of the Pension Book OBCS Failure.** Credit
Note 8001005 for this amount appears to have been issued by Fujitsu
in respect of the Pension Book OBCS Failure in or around April
