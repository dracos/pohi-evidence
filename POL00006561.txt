Dear XXXXX

Post Office Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme (the “Scheme”) - Second Sight's “Part
Two” Report (the “Report”)

In my letter of 11 September I undertook to write to you again setting out Post Office's detailed
position on the various points raised in the Report. A copy of Post office’s reply to the Report is
enclosed.

As I explained in my letter Post Office cannot endorse the Report because it believes it to be
inaccurate in important areas, that there is no clear statement of the evidence upon which many of
the opinions expressed in the Report are based, and that it includes matters which are beyond the
scope of the Scheme and/or Second Sight’s professional expertise as forensic accountants.

I would stress that Post Office has taken the decision to produce a reply to the Report to help
achieve the overall aims of the Scheme, that is to try to achieve the resolution of an Applicant’s
concerns about Horizon and associated issues. Post Office therefore considers it important that you
are aware of Post Office’s position on the matters covered in the Report, and are able to understand
the reasons for it. You can then take account of this when considering the extent to which you wish
to rely on the Report as your case progresses through the Scheme and, if applicable, at mediation.

Finally I would remind you that documents prepared for the Scheme and mediation are confidential
and should not be disclosed to any person other than a person involved in processing Applications
through the Scheme.

!am copying this to your professional advisor.

Yours sincerely,

“Angela Van Den Bogerd
