Here is the history of this Problem:
The Outreach Issue
The issue was identified by the following being reported to Fujitsu by Post Office:

The Dalmellington Post Mistress who runs a Core and Outreach branch remitted £8,000 out of the Core branch and then
attempted to remit the cash into the Outreach Branch. However when the cash was remitted into the Outreach Branch the
system repeated the inward remittance transaction 3 times, thus remitting in a total value of £32,000. This was £24,000
more than the actual cash being remitted and so resulted in the system at the Outreach Branch showing a deficit of
£24,000. All these transaction show up in the Branch Reports.

Problem Identification
There are actually 2 separate issues which if occurring in combination leads to the scenario described above:

e The Forced Log Out.
o Doesn’t correctly close down the Post Log On script. This leaves the script on the “stack” of incomplete
processes.
e The Pouch Delivery script thinks it has completed doesn’t explicitly finish.
o When the Remittance is complete and all the receipts have been printed, the last screen asks the user to press
Enter to complete the Remittance process.

It relies on a mechanism which checks the stack of incomplete processes to see if it is complete. Due to the fact that the
stack is not empty (following the first problem) it thinks it has not finished and as a result attempts to repeat the last part of
the script, which in this case is to record the remittance transactions and print the receipt

Each repeat press of the enter key causes a new remittance to be recorded but each one appears in the branch reports.

The Dalmellington case was the first time this had been identified to Fujitsu as an issue (even though there had been present
in HNGX from day 1).

Correction

Once the error was identified monitoring was put in place to identify if the error before the fix was in place proactive
interventions could take place (as it happened no other cases came to light in this period).

This error was corrected at Counter release 12.88, CTR_APP_X1288_V646 following approval by POL by modifying the

logic for these transactions so that the state tracking the progress through the current PDL transaction is reset so that it is
not “inherited” by the next PDL use case. The milestones of solution implementation were:

e 4th January 2016 Model office testing.
FUJ00085967
FUJ00085967

e 7th January 2016 Pilot phase.
e WC 11th January 2016 Live deployment.

Wider Context
Fujitsu also discussed in detail with Post Office any further implications of this problem which included:

e Identifying the occurrences where branches had been affected by this issue (since HNGX was deployed) and
how they had been corrected either by the branch realising by looking at the reports what had happened and
adding a balancing remittance themselves or in some instances contacting the FSC who issued a transaction
correction which balanced the extra remittances. (the identified cases information is included at the end of this
email)

e Explaining with screen shots how the forced logoff works in settling with fast cash process o was not affected
by this issue.

e Completing testing of all the identified use cases where this issue could have had an effect.

The details of the issue and our test approach were documented in DEV/CNT/CTP/3008 - ODR Further Investigation -
Component Test Plan. (attached ? Steve can you add a copy of this document as I don’t have a copy)

The ODR exercise did not identify any occurrences of the original issue.
Occurrences

e 112 occurrences of Duplicate found pouches over the 5 years of HNGX
e 2010 — 63 Incidents
o Jan 2011Fix applied - Pouch REM in on 2 counters caused the majority of these incidents. Not related to
the later issue
2011 — 8 Incidents
2012 — 9 Incidents
2013 —7 Incidents
2014 — 9 Incidents
2015 — 16 Incidents
© Jan 2016 Fix to be applied no occurrences since have been identified. Daily monitoring has now stopped

Hi

We implemented a fix for this issue following POL approval to proceed with R12.88.
e 4th January 2016 Model office testing
e 7th January 2016 Pilot phase
e WC 11th January 2016 Live deployment

We also discussed in detail with POL and provided documents that:

e Give the findings of the data extraction
e Explain with screen shots the forced logoff settled with fast cash process
e Explained how we intended to undertake further testing
Internally we produced DEV/CNT/CTP/3008 - ODR Further Investigation - Component Test Plan
The Component Test Report has been updated — currently in SharePoint and Dimensions.
Basic conclusion: The ODR exercise did not identify any new problems.

To: "Rob Houghton" <Rob.Houghtort,

Rob — please find attached Fujitsu’s report on the “Branch Outreach” issue, which Mr Tim McCormack references in his blog.
I think the first thing to check is whether Fujitsu has implemented a fix for the issue, and if so, when.
Thanks, Rod

All

We are on top of this. Mr McCormack regularly writes to us in unpleasant terms and unfortunately he also posts very unpleasant blogs. All the
matters of which he complains are the subject of review by the CCRC.

Dear both,
This needs looking into please.

https://problemswithpol.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/the-error-in-horizon/?iframe=true&theme_preview=true

Can I have a report that takes the points in order and explains them.

Tim McCormack is campaigning against PO and Horizon. I had another note from him this am which Tom will forward, so you are both in the
loop.

We must take him seriously and professionally.

This particular blog is independent of Sparrow but clearly related in that it appears to present similar challenges that were raised in the course of
the scheme.

I'm most concerned that we/ our suppliers appear to be very lax at handling £24k. And want to know we've rectified all the issues raised, if they
happened as Tim explains.

Thanks.

Paula
