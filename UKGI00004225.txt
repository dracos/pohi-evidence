Post Office response (including fuller statement in the attached):

A Post Office spokesman said: “Over the past three years there have been exhaustive investigations which
have not found any evidence of systemic problems with the Horizon system. The mediation scheme was set
up to address individual complaints and that is what we have gone to great lengths to do — a number are
now resolved. The complaints are considered on their facts and substance.”

This is a matter for Post Office and the applicants, not Govt, so grateful for any enquiries to continue to be
sent POL’s way.

R4 seem to be focusing on the impact on individual sub postmasters who have been accused of wrongdoing when
theres cash missing in the post office - and have gone to prison (apparently one has committed suicide). I know you
sent up the full POL response last week, do you have the top press lines that POL are using in response?

Hannah / Ashley

Post Office has just informed me that they have been receiving enquiries from the BBC about Horizon this evening
and they now expect it to feature tomorrow, possibly on the Today programme.

Post Office plan to put in a formal complaint (don't know the details) but as Laura's email below proposes, any queries
to BIS should be directed to POL in the first instance.

Kind regards
Richard

Hannah, Ashley

Just to let you know that so far there doesn’t seem to be too much going on here. It may come out over the weekend,
or next week ~ it’s hard to tell.

If there are any press enquiries, we should maintain the line that this is not a matter for Government and direct any
enquiries to Post Office.

{’m out from this afternoon, back in the office on 5 May. If there are any developments or questions over that time,
please speak to Richard, copied. Richard is happy for his contact details to be provided to the duty officer: mobile

Subject: Update on Post Office Horizon issue

Importance: High

Hannah, Ashley

As I mentioned yesterday (and my email last week refers) — we expect the next development in the Post Office
Horizon issue to happen tomorrow (Thursday) or possibly Friday.

Second Sight, the independent investigators looking into the Horizon IT system, have completed their final report into
the matter. This report will be issued to all remaining applicants in the Mediation Scheme later today, and as such is
likely to arrive tomorrow or Friday (it is being delivered in hard copy).

Post Office advise that the report is poor, containing unsubstantiated allegations and misrepresentations. As such,
they are issuing their own response to the report alongside it. This will also be sent to applicants at the same time.

The report is designed to inform those applicants in the scheme awaiting mediation. It is not designed to be
published; however, we expect that once it is received by applicants (which include JFSA members) it will be leaked.
Post Office anticipate this will happen and are prepared to release the report in full, alongside POL’s response, to
journalists on request, on the understanding that they should a) respect its confidentiality and not publish it and b)
ensure any reports are balanced and cover both the SS report and POL’s response.

POL will send a copy of the report and their response to BIS later today (it will go to Richard Callard, head of the
Shareholder team here). This is in line with the commitment that Vince Cable made in his letter to the BIS Select
Committee last month.

I understand from POL that, while the report does not make any particularly new accusations, it still contains criticism
of POL and these could be picked up by interested parties (probably Nick Wallis from the One Show). However, it is
important to note that the report maintains the conclusion that there are no systemic flaws in Horizon capable of
causing the issues that have been claimed.

As before, if we receive any press enquiries we should direct these to Post Office. The mediation scheme is
independent of Government and details of cases are confidential. If you come under pressure for a line, please let me
or Richard know. Happy for my contact details to be provided to the Duty Officer.

Claire — it would be worth making sure Jo is aware.

George —I am happy to explain a bit more background on this if helpful. It may be worth notifying Vince that this is
coming out but we do not expect it to make a large splash media-wise.

Thanks
Laura
