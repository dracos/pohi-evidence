20191016 Sub for Appt of NED - Zarin Patel.docx

With thanks to those cc’ed for their comments and clearance please see attached a submission requesting the
approval of a new NED, Zarin Patel, to the POL Board.

To confirm, we are proceeding with the appointment of two NEDs, Zarin being the first, but final checks are being
carried out for the other NED appointment, Lisa Harrington.

Once these are complete we will follow up with a separate submission for Lisa’s appointment. To note, this will be on
an updated submission template we have received from the Partnerships team so will look a bit different but with the
same expected content.

Any questions please let me know.

Cheers,

Josh
