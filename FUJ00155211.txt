the problem is that transaction <GroupId:226242><Id:1><Num:1425636> has corrupt primary mappings which do not align and this
jcauses DataServer to fail.

It notice that relevant product 21126 has mappings but was start dated after the failing transaction was written.
lberhaps there was a corrupt EPOSSProducts in existence at the time of the transaction?

[the product 21126 has been transacted seconds before and after the failing transaction with no problem. So if a corrupt
JEPOSSProduct's existed it must have been for a very short time.

[the problem was that msg 1-1425636 had got corrupted (it had an incorrect Primary Mapping containing <L4:3011> - all the other
Insqs for the same ProductNo:21126 correctly had <L4:3013>). This meant that the codé kept looping with "System Busy" and the PM
jcouldn't balance (despite leaving the counter running overnight) .

R 17725 was raised to correct the msg and then import it and a partial mstore (attached as evidence) at counter 2. The PM has
been asked that when he comes to balance today, he MUST do it from counter 2. Holding call open until PM has rolled successfully.
