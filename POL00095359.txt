Dear Lisa,
Cleveleys Post Office

Further to our recent telephone conversations regarding Cleveleys Sub Post Office, I
am now able to say that Chesterfield have completed their checks of the accounts.

Unfortunately it does appear that the former subpostmistress, who ran the office in
Runnymede Avenue, did have difficulties operating the Horizon system. Our
accounts department have already actioned the necessary error notices to correct the
accounts, and therefore no loss would be passed on to the Department.

As I have previously explained, as the matter relates to a personnel issue, I am unable
to comment further.

Yours sincerely

Tim Bentley
Client Manager
