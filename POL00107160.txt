1 Executive Summary

Context

As outlined to us by the Post Office Limited (“POL”) litigation team, “ POL is responding to allegations from Sub-
posimasters that the “Horizon” IT system used to record transactions in POL branches is defective and that the
processes associated with it are inadequate (e.g. that it may be the source and/or cause of branch losses). POL is
committed to ensuring and demonstrating that the current Horizon system is robust and operates with integrity,
within an appropriate control framework. “

POL is confident that Horizon and its associated control activities deliver a robust processing environment through
three mechanisms: POL have designed features directly into Horizon to exert control; POL operates IT
management over Horizon; and POL have implemented controls into and around the business processes making
use of Horizon. Collectively these three approaches of inherent systems design, ongoing systems management
and business process control are designed to deliver a Horizon processing environment which operates with
integrity.

Since its implementation in branches, POL has commissioned or has received a number of pieces of work relating
to the Horizon processing environment, to provide comfort over its integrity. This work, referred to in our report as
the “Assurance Work”, provides documented assertions relating to aspects of the design and operation of the
Horizon processing environment. The Assurance Work includes IT project documents; operational policies and
procedures; internal and external investigations and reviews; independent audits; and emails confirming otherwise
verbal assertions.

Deloitte has been appointed to:
* consider whether this Assurance Work appropriately covers key risks relating to the integrity of the
processing environment,
to extract from the Assurance Work an initial schedule of the Horizon Features’,
* to raise suggestions for potential improvements in the assurance provision.

* “Horizon Features” is a term we have introduced to represent those features of the Horizon processing environment, including IT management
and business use controls, which provide that:
* movements in Branch ledgers have the full ownership and visibility of sub-postmasters; and
* — audit trails kept by the system are complete and accurate.

Summary of Approach Key assertions requiring assurance, to underpin confidence in processing integrity

We have structured our work around the
key control assertions shown in the

with POL. We consider these to be key
matters that POL should control in order to
gain comfort over the integrity of
processing.

We have considered POL’s three design

POL00107160
POL00107160

A key element of the approach was to identify the Horizon Features. POL did not have an existing document that
could be described as representing the Horizon Features in a demonstrably complete way, therefore we have
drawn out an initial view of the Horizon Features from the underlying documentation and considered Assurance
Work relating to them (Appendix 2) for the purposes of this review.

As communicated to us by management, we have also considered the following 5 key control objectives during our
activities to identify Horizon Features:

1. Horizon only allows complete baskets of transactions to be processed;

2. Baskets being communicated between Branch and Data Centre are not subject to tampering before being
copied to the Audit Store;

3. Baskets of transactions recorded to the Audit Store are complete and ‘digitally sealed’, to protect their
integrity and make it evident if they have been tampered with;

4. Horizon’s Audit Store maintains and reports from a complete and unchanged record of all sealed baskets;
and

5. Horizon provides visibility to Sub-postmasters of all centrally generated transactions processed to their
Branch ledgers.

These key control objectives are an important subset of the overail set of key control assertions highlighted in the
diagram above.

We have grouped the Assurance Work provided to us into three areas, corresponding to POL’s three mechanisms
of exerting contro! over the processing environment, as follows:

e System Baseline Assurance Work: This aims to provide comfort that the original Horizon implementation
and other changes performed under formal projects were well governed (compared to Deloitte project
management methodologies) and that detailed testing was performed against agreed business
requirements. Such activity would verify that the system was, at that point in time, fit for purpose and
implemented as intended. This assessment considers the point when the system and processes are
created.

e IT Provision Assurance Work: This aims to provide comfort that the IT management activities required to
run the Horizon system with integrity are designed and operating effectively. Such activity verifies that key
day-to-day IT management activities (e.g. security, IT operations and system changes) are appropriately
governed and controlled.

« System Usage Assurance Work: This assurance aims to provide comfort that the controls in and around
the business processes which make use of the Horizon system are appropriately designed, in place and
operating as intended.

Our work has been performed as a desktop review of documentation made available and has neither tested the
quality, completeness or accuracy of the Assurance Work provided to us or tested any controls relating to the
Horizon processing environment.

Summary of Observations

Substantial Horizon-related system documentation exists, comparable to that typically seen in organisations of a
similar scale where IT activities are outsourced and formal assurance activities are not mandated. Some
organisations are externally mandated to have a greater level of end-to-end, risk orientated documentation and
testing, e.g. in financial services. POL is not so mandated.

Based on our review of the available documentation, our key observations are:

¢ The extensive Horizon system documentation is structured from a technical rather than a risk and controls
perspective and provides an understanding of the Horizon Features. POL should conduct a formal

STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL, SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE.

POL00107160
POL00107160

assessment to identify a complete set of Horizon Features that respond to POL’s control objectives.

The integrity of the Audit Store is designed to be preserved by a system of “digital seals” and “digital
signatures”. This feature underpins the ability to confirm the completeness and accuracy of data kept in the
Audit Store, and that of subsequent reports generated from the Audit Store. These digital seals and digital
signatures are both key components in the Horizon Features which are both validated during the extraction
process from the Audit Store.

POL is relying on the Horizon Features being implemented and operating as described. Whilst our review
focussed on the design of the Horizon Features, the Assurance Work we have assessed does not
completely test these features for implementation and operating effectiveness. Only those Horizon
Features relating to IT Provision have been validated and tested by independent third parties. In addition,
during the course of our engagement, one of the Horizon Features has been discovered by POL to not be
implemented as expected.

Business use (process) documentation is not complete or up to date, by some years in cases. As part of
completing or updating the documentation of Horizon Features, all relevant business uses should be
identified and evaluated from a control objectives perspective to identify potential additional matters being
relied upon.

Pre 2010 Baseline Assurance Work could not be provided by POL. This Assurance Work is required to
evaluate the comfort that the system was originally built and tested to specific business requirements. The
implementation in 2010 of HNG-X is asserted by POL to have not significantly impacted the design of the
Horizon Features.

Governing controls over key, day-to-day IT management activities have been independently tested and
opined by Ernst and Young (since 2012) to a recognised assurance standard (ISAE3402).

A number of third party systems are used by Horizon on a day-to-day operational basis. Documentation
asserts that these interactions do not impact on the Horizon Features.

Scope Limitations

Our work has been subject to the following exclusions:

.

Only matters relating to the Horizon Features within the Horizon processing environment have been
considered during our review;

We have not provided a legal or any other opinion as to the completeness and accuracy of processing of
Horizon at any point throughout the work;

We have not had direct contact with any third parties other than named contacts that you have provided to
us (Appendix 3);

We have not verified or tested any information provided directly by you, or directly or indirectly by third
parties (the schedule of information received is in Appendix 3);

We have not reviewed any contractual provisions in place between you and third parties;
Our work was limited by significant gaps existing in the information available, relating to both the granularity

of information and the existence of the Horizon Features over the entire timeline of operation of Horizon.
The effect of which is that there are in gaps within what we are able to comment upon over this timeline.

e Anevent occurred in 2010 which required the use of the exceptional Balancing Transaction process in
Horizon to correct a Sub-postmasters position from a technical issue. Information has not been provided on
the circumstances that lead to this system issue and how the issue was identified. It is assumed that verbal
assertions received from Fujitsu that this was the only time this process has been used hold true;

© We have not tested any of the Horizon Features; and

e We have not validated or commented on the quality of the Assurance Work supplied to us.

Our work was also based on the following assumptions:

e The documents provided are a complete and accurate representation of the Horizon design. We therefore
cannot comment as to whether the Horizon Features described below are complete nor whether other
processes or mechanisms exist which would need consideration in the context of the Matters.

e Allchanges made after the initial implementation have been properly approved, tested and validated as not
undermining the Horizon Features i.e. that the system’s controls have retained their integrity throughout
and thus the controls identified within the documentation have been consistent over the system’s lifetime.

e The assertions received relating to the major upgrade of Horizon in 2010 not materially changing the
design of the Horizon Features hold true.

e The cryptographic keys underpinning the digital signatures in Horizon have not been compromised.

* The mechanisms for issuing cryptographic keys for signing baskets is secure and authenticates requests to
prevent unauthorised provision of keys.

e Fraud or collusion to undermine or work around the Horizon Features has not occurred, in particular within
database administrator and security teams in Fujitsu.

e Assertions made by POL and Fujitsu staff have been accepted as accurate without corroboration or

2 Introduction

Introduction

The Horizon system has been used by POL since 1995. During this time it has processed many millions of
transactions across thousands of branches. Horizon is accredited by Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard (PCI DSS) and 1S027001. Itis currently used by more than 68,000 users across 11,500 POL branches
and is administered by Fujitsu as part of a managed service agreement. It is a key operational system for POL and
integrity of processing on the system is crucial to the day-to-day operations of the business.

POL is responding to allegations that the Horizon processing environment, used to record transactions in POL
branches, is defective and/or that the processes associated with it are inadequate.

In order to respond better to the allegations (which have been, and will in all likelihood continue to be, advanced in
the Courts), POL management want to demonstrate that the Horizon processing environment is robust and
operates with integrity, within an appropriate control framework.

In particular, management at POL has highlighted two key statements they would like to assess their comfort over
in response fo the allegations, being:

1. That Sub-postmasters have full ownership and visibility of all records in their Branch ledger; and
2. That the Branch ledger records are kept by the system with integrity and full audit trail.

These statements have then been further sub-divided into the following statements:

Horizon only allows complete baskets of transactions to be processed;

Baskets being communicated between Branch and Data Centre are not subject to tampering before being
copied to the Audit Store;

Baskets of transactions recorded to the Audit Store are complete and ‘digitally sealed’, to protect their
integrity and make it evident if they have been tampered with;

Horizon’s Audit Store maintains and reports from a complete and unchanged record of all sealed baskets;
and

5. Horizon provides visibility to Sub-postmasters of all centrally generated transactions processed to their
Branch ledgers.

POL management have previously either been provided with or commissioned work (including independent
assurance reviews) into matters relating to Horizon’s operating environment and processing integrity. Documents
outlined in Appendix 3 have been provided to us and considered as part of the planning and delivery of our review.

- Objectives and Activities Undertaken

The purpose of this report is to provide, based upon the information made available to us by you, an independently
produced summary of the Assurance Work undertaken over your current day Horizon processing environment and
make recommendations on further work that could be done to enhance these assurance sources.

The work we have performed to produce this report has included:

¢ Obtaining an understanding of the Allegations; POL’s key risks in and internal controls over the Horizon
processing environment relevant to the integrity of processing; the measures in place to record and
preserve the integrity of system audit trails and other background matters that we may deem necessary to
complete our review;

DRAFT FINDINGS
STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL. SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE.

POL00107160
POL00107160

* Obtaining an understanding of the key differences between the current Horizon processing environment,
and the system which this replaced (here-to referred to as the “Legacy System”);

« . Reviewing, understanding and consolidating the Assurance Work (e.g.: investigations, assurance activities
and remediation actions) which POL or third parties have undertaken;

¢ Holding discussions with relevant members of POL staff and other key stakeholders;

e Reviewing project documentation relating to the 2010 implementation of Horizon, in order to compare the
nature and extent of project governance and documentation with Deloitte's good practice project
management methodology;

«Preparing an initial schedule of Horizon Features and assessing the level of comfort over these, provided
by POL’s Assurance Work (including the use of a specialist to assess the design of the Audit Store’s
tamper proof mechanisms); and

e Recommend further activities that management could undertake to improve the assurance provision.

Scope limitations and assumptions are outlined in the Executive Summary above.

Understanding of Historical Issues and Concerns

As an initial step, in building the requisite understanding required of the historical context leading to this review, we
have reviewed the documentation provided by POL in order to understand the history of issues and concerns which
have been raised in relation to the system.

From the documents provided, we have identified the following matters which have helped to provide us with a high
level understanding of the nature and extent of the potential concerns with the Horizon processing environment,
and thus focus our work in certain higher risk areas:

Branch 14 Issue - Involved a processing error where historic accounting entries in the 2010/11 financial year were
replicated in accounts for 2011/12 and 2012/13.

Branch 62 Issue - Involved a Receipts and Payments mismatch in Horizon when discrepancies were moved into
the local suspense account (this is an account which aggregates all discrepancies into a single gain or loss for a
branch trading period).

Falkirk Issue - The Falkirk Anomaly occurred when cash or stock was transferred between stock units.

Spot Review Bible — This outlines a sequence of matters raised during the work performed by Second Sight over
the allegations raised over the Horizon system, and summary commentary on 10 issues within.

Lepton Detailed Spot Review Information (included within Spot Check Bible) — Detailed documentation has
also been provided in relation to Spot Review 1. The issue raised was that a Sub-postmaster will not be notified
about automatic reversals of transactions when not connected to the data centre.

Reflecting on the nature and substance of these issues, and documentation relating to their follow-up and
resolution, we have understood the importance of the audit trail to provide evidence relating to disparities between
Sub-postmaster accounts of events and subsequent investigations, based on audit trail evidence, by POL/Fujitsu.

As a result of the above understanding, our work relating to IT Provision and System Usage Assurance Work paid
particular (but not exclusive) focus on Information System Operations (IT environment processing), and business
processes controlling relevant key data flows (the key data flow for our assessment being that of the complete and
accurate transmission of data from the Counter system at the Branch to the Branch Database and subsequently
into the Audit Store).

3 Approach

In the absence of POL’s own holistic risk assessment relating to the Horizon processing environment, key to our
assessment of sources of assurance has been the formulation of an initial “risk universe”, against which coverage
of the associated risks by the relevant sources of assurance can be assessed (“mapped”).

We have considered this risk universe across three key areas:

4. Control objectives and risks relating to the ‘System Baseline’.
2. Control objectives and risks relating to ‘IT Provision’.
3. Control objectives and risks relating to ‘System Usage’.

Risks relating to the System Baseline — these are risks that the original implementation project and other
changes performed under formal projects were not conducted in line with good project management practices, and
that detailed testing was not performed against agreed business requirements. These risks are governed and
controlled outside of day-to-day system operating procedures. Controls which mitigate these risks are often
teferred to as “Project Controls” and “Inherent System Controls” (those designed and built into the IT system).

Risks relating to IT Provision — these are risks that the underlying IT activities, necessary to provide a system
that can run and be used with integrity, are not designed and operating effectively. Such risks relate to key day-to-
day IT management activities, relating to security, IT operations and system changes. Controls which mitigate
these risks are often referred to as “General Computer Controls”. Our work focussed on assurance provided over
Fujitsu's activities in these areas.

Risks over System Usage ~ these are risks that key features of Horizon and corresponding business use
activities (processes), aiming to prevent or detect matters that would impact the integrity of processing, are not
designed, in place or operating as intended. These are the more detailed risks in relation to particular aspects of
capturing and processing transactions across the Horizon processing environment. Controls which mitigate these
tisks are often referred to as “End User Controls”, “Application Embedded Controls” and “Process Controls”. Our
work focussed on the internal dataflows within Horizon (Counter to Branch Database to Audit Store for example)
and we also considered the relevance of interfaces with other systems such as the DVLA.

In the context of these three areas of risk we have performed knowledge gathering activities in order to understand
the Horizon processing environment in sufficient detail to identify specific risk areas and those Horizon Features
identified to exert control over these risks.

4. Approach to Understanding of System Baseline Risks

| e Any that lead to changes to the Audit Store;
¢ The Horizon Implementation Programme in 2010-2011;
‘a e The Data Strategy Foundation project in 2012 and 2013 (which updated the dataflows into Horizon from

2. Approach to Understanding of IT Provision Risks

Our understanding of IT Provision risks has been formulated through our understanding of the system via
documentation review and verbal discussion with supporting POL and Fujitsu SMEs. Due to the nature of the
System Provisioning risk areas, the formulation of this understanding has been mainly through interview with
Fujitsu and POL security team members.

3. Approach to Understanding of System Usage Risks

Our understanding of System Usage risks has again been formulated through documentation review and verbal
discussion with supporting SME's to identify additional support areas. Due to the nature of the System Usage risk
areas, the formulation of this understanding has been mainly through interview with Fujitsu, POL Finance Shared
Services and POL Security team members.

4. Approach to Consideration of the Horizon Features

In the formulation of our risk universes across the three areas highlighted in 1 — 3 above we have considered the 5
key matters relevant to the Horizon Features as instructed by management:

1. Horizon only allows complete baskets of transactions to be processed;

2. Baskets being communicated between Branch and Data Centre are not subject to tampering before being
copied to the Audit Store;

3. Baskets of transactions recorded to the Audit Store are complete and ‘digitally sealed’, to protect their
integrity and make it evident if they have been tampered with;

4. Horizon’s Audit Store maintains and reports from a complete and unchanged record of all sealed baskets;
and

5. Horizon provides visibility to Sub-postmasters of all centrally generated transactions processed to their
Branch ledgers.

5. Combining the Above

Following our assessment across these four areas, the diagram below (see overleaf) describes the key risks
identified within the Horizon processing environment. We have number coded the risks in the below with (1)

corresponding to Baseline Risks, (2) corresponding to IT Provision Risks, and (3) corresponding to System Usage
Risks.

This diagram thus represents the framework of key risks that need to be controlled by Horizon Features and
appropriately assured in order to provide the comfort required by POL management.

Example Assurance
Sources

When considering the sources of assurance over IT Provision Risks, System Usage Risks and System Baseline
Risks, a number of parties have been (and continue to be), involved in performing work over the Horizon
processing environment which contributes to the overall assurance management has over the correct operation of
the system.

Assurance Work from the following organisations, in addition to information provided from POL, have been
identified and considered in our work:

« Fujitsu, who designed, built and now operate Horizon;
e Bureau Veritas, who perform 18027001 certification over Fujitsu’s networks, including that of Horizon;

* — Information Risk Management (IRM) who accredit Horizon to PCI DSS;

¢ Ernst & Young, who produce an ISAE3402 service auditor report over the Horizon processing environment;
and

¢ Internal audit, who perform risk based reviews within POL.

In considering the Assurance Work provided to us by management during the course of this engagement we have
considered whether they constitute assurance provided under an assurance engagement, as defined by IFAC, or
are sources of information that provide comfort in other ways. For the purposes of clarifying the Assurance Work,

we have assigned each document received to one of two classifications, defined as follows:

“Assurance” —The Assurance Work has been provided under an assurance engagement by an independent third
party, suitably qualified in the subject matter constituting the focus of the engagement to provide a valid opinion.
Sources of such assurance include:

¢ — Internal Audit functions;

e External Audit; and

* — Other third party reviews, not involved in the original design nor day-to-day operation of the system
containing (a) a formal opinion, such as those performed in line with recognised standards, such as
ISAE3402 or (b) no formal opinion (i.e. a report based on evidence and facts without interpretation).

“Other Sources of Comfort” — The Assurance Work is either not produced by an independent party or by an
individual who is suitably qualified in assurance engagements, or both. Other sources of comfort include:

¢ IT Project Documentation;

¢ Operational Documentation, such as policies, procedures and process / system information produced by
functional teams;

¢ Reviews or investigations performed by outsourcers (e.g. deep dives, diagnostics, spot reviews);

¢ Business peer group review teams and functions; and

« ‘Second line’ compliance teams.

In Appendix 3 we have documented ail the Assurance Work we received and added our classification of those
sources by these two categories.

Summary of Work Performed

Based upon the concepts outlined above we have performed the desktop based work below (further detail of which
is outlined in our Engagement Letter shown in Appendix 4). We have not performed any testing to validate the
information provided to us as part of our work.

Step 1: Analysis and Review

¢ Activity 1. Documentation Review - We have reviewed a number of documents produced by several
different organisations in order to understand key matters relating to the Horizon system and the
Assurance Work available.

¢ Activity 2. Risk Universe Formulation - We have then, in the absence of a holistic risk assessment being
performed by POL and thus for the purposes of our assessment, created a risk universe based on our
experience of information processing systems encompassing the three primary risk areas previously
identified IT Provision, System Usage and Baseline Risks. The five key matters for consideration outlined
by management were also considered during this process.

¢ Activity 3. Review of Assurance Work — The available documentation was reviewed in order to
understand the Assurance Work available to POL, against each of the three identified risk areas.

POL00107160

Step 2: Gap Analysis and Assessment
Based on the analysis in Step 1 we have produced:

° Activity 4. System Provisioning Assurance Assessments and Gap Analysis - Considering key
potential gaps or areas of ambiguity in the available assurance sources when considering the System
Provisioning risk universe.

« Activity 5. System Usage and Baseline Assurance Assessments and Gap Analysis — Assessing the
documentation relating to System Usage Risks and then performed deep dives into the following areas of
specific risk:

Horizon interfaces (including DVLA);
Branch Database;

Audit Store;

Horizon Implementation Project;
Audit Store Changes; and

Data Strategy Foundation project.

000000

¢ Activity 6. Peer Comparison to Assurance Available to Similar Organisations - We have assessed
the Assurance Work available to similar organisations over System Provisioning Risks (the area of risk
where a benchmark is most valid due to the level of information available from POL) and assessed
therefore whether POL has comparable levels of assurance.

Step 3: Reporting
The analysis and interpretation in Step 2 has allowed us to formulate:

e Activity 7. Produce an Assurance Schedule over Horizon Features, and Recommendations —
Mapping control assertions, Horizon Features and Assurance Work and reporting on the level of comfort
that we have assessed in each of these areas. Identification of the key considerations for management
arising from our analysis and plan of action to respond to these recommendations.

Amore detailed description of these activities performed follows.

Activity 1: Documentation Review

All of the documentation reviewed during the course of our review has been documented within Appendix 3. This
documentation can be divided into the following classifications:

* Technical documentation on the Operation of the Horizon System — Reviewed in order to gain a deeper
understanding on how the Horizon system works, how complex it is, and where we should be focusing
further efforts and analysis;

* Independent Third Party Assurance documentation — This documentation has been reviewed in order to
understand the existing assurance sources relevant to the environment;

¢ Documentation of Historical Issues and Allegations in relation to the Horizon System — This documentation
has been reviewed in order to understand the background context and better position the IT Provision,
System Usage and Baseline System risk work performed over the environment; and

* Service Provider Analysis and Response to Issues — This documentation has been reviewed to gain an
understanding of the work performed by Fujitsu in investigating the issues raised, and how these will be
responded to.

POL00107160

A number of individuals from POL have been interviewed during the course of formulating this report to supplement
our understanding from the provided documentation.

Activity 2: Risk Universe Formulation

System Baseline Risk Universe

The original implementation of Horizon in 1995, together with subsequent changes (whether routine via change
management processes, or large complex change programmes such as the Horizon system implementation in
2010-11), represent events affecting Baseline System Risk.

To assess these risks we have understood the history of the Horizon system and selected three areas for more
detailed investigation including:

¢ Horizon Implementation;

e Data Strategy Foundation project; and

« Asample of changes to the Audit Store (subsequent to determining that this key risk area for the system
had been left largely untouched by the key implementation events highlighted in the previous two bullets).

For each of these change areas we have assessed the Assurance Work from a governance and control
perspective, and POL ability to take comfort that the Horizon system was fit for purpose at the time of the change
and operated in line with management intentions (through business requirements definitions and project testing
against these).

IT Provision Risk Universe

This risk universe was formulated from our prior experience of auditing and assuring information systems and
involved the identification of high level risks across three core areas:

¢ Information Security;
¢ Information System Operations; and
e® Change Management.

Once the IT Provisioning risk universe had been formulated a mapping of control objectives within the Assurance
Work was performed in order to assess coverage.

The three sources of assurance included within this mapping were:

¢ ISAE3402 report on the Horizon managed service;
e PCI DSS compliance report on Horizon; and
¢ 18027001 Statement of Applicability.

System Usage Risk Universe

As POL has not conducted a holistic assessment of risk in this area, a full understanding and assessment of
assurance over the System Usage risk environment was not available for our review.

Instead we focussed our assessment on two key areas of risk: those relating to the completeness and accuracy of
the Audit Store, the Branch Database and key system interfaces with a significant third party, such as the DVLA.
We sought to understand the Assurance Work that has been done against each of these areas.

This involved:

« Enquiry with relevant SMEs;
e Review of documentation;

POL00107160
POL00107160

e Formulation of a risk universe in these specific areas; and
« Understanding of existing assurance work over controls which mitigate these risks.

Horizon Features

Across each of the three risk universes we identified features within the processing environment that exert control
and provide that:

1. Horizon only allows complete baskets of transactions to be processed;

2. Baskets being communicated between Branch and Data Centre are not subject to tampering before being
copied to the Audit Store;

3. Baskets of transactions recorded to the Audit Store are complete and ‘digitally sealed’, to protect their
integrity and make it evident if they have been tampered with;

4. Horizon’s Audit Store maintains and reports from a complete and unchanged record of all sealed baskets;
and

5. Horizon provides visibility to Sub-postmasters of all centrally generated transactions processed to their
Branch ledgers.

We refer to these identified features as the “Horizon Features” and identification of these features in response to
the matters for consideration listed above was a core component of our work.

Activity 3: Review of Assurance Work

With the background context of the three risk universes outlined within the previous section, we reviewed the
available Assurance Work in order to assess the coverage and nature of the comfort provided by the work.

The documentation reviewed during this stage has been listed within Appendix 3, as are the names of individuals
consulted in relation to our work.

Activity 4: System Provision Assurance Assessments and Gap Analysis

Once the System Provisioning risk universes had been formulated a mapping of control objectives within each of
the main assurance sources was performed in order to assess coverage. The three sources of assurance included
within this mapping were:

« 1ISAE3402 report on the Horizon managed service;
« PCI DSS compliance report on Horizon; and
e 1§027001 Statement of Applicability.

The results of this mapping exercise are summarised within Section 5 and reproduced, in detail, within Appendix.1.

In parallel to this assurance exercise we have also summarised key matters relating to each assurance source.
This involved considering the context and focus of the relevant Assurance Work and comparing these to the
context and focus that would be required for coverage of the key risks (this was in recognition of the risk that some
of the documents could be used or applied out of context from their original purpose).

Activity 5: System Usage and Baseline Assurance Assessments and Gap Analysis

Following our understanding of the system and historical issues the following areas were singled out as relevant for
deeper analysis, and this approach was agreed with POL management:

1. Audit Store — The audit store has been used frequently in investigations by POL / Fujitsu and is used as
supporting evidence during legal proceedings. Therefore its integrity is paramount to responding to these
issues. However the audit store cannot be relied on in isolation, as its integrity is dependent upon the
correct processing of transactions by the wider Horizon system (upstream events if processed incorrectly
will be recorded incorrectly by the audit store).

\

POL00107160
POL00107160

2. Horizon interfaces (including DVLA) — Horizon is reliant on a significant number of batch processes and
online services (including interfaces with third party systems) in order to function correctly. These routines
need to be functioning correctly and accurately for the transactions processed by the system and ultimately
recorded in the audit trail to be reflective of the underlying commercial realities and business transactions
they pertain to represent.

3. Branch Database — The Branch Database is a key ‘staging post’ for data being transacted on counters
within individual branches prior to transmission onwards to the Audit Store. As data from branches in held
within the messaging journal table on this system for up to a day before being processed into the audit
store the security controls and processes protecting this data whilst in temporary storage here are
paramount.

4. Horizon Implementation Project — This change represented the largest single change to the Horizon
system since implementation, and also the change implemented prior to adoption of the current major
release of the system, and so was considered of particular relevance to our overall understanding of
Baseline System risk.

5. Audit Store Changes — Our understanding of the HNG-X Implementation Project quickly highlighted that
this project had very little impact on the Audit Store itself. As a result we performed procedures to
understand some of the changes which had been made to the Audit Store following its original
implementation.

6. Data Strategy Foundation Project — We determined during the course of our work that this was another
key implementation project in the recent history of the Horizon system of particular relevance to a sub-
group of the system interfaces on Horizon. This project was therefore also deemed key for our
understanding of system Baseline risk.

For each of the areas outlined in 1-6 above an assessment was made of the coverage and nature of the
Assurance Work provided.

For areas 1-3 (System Usage Risks) the functionality of the particular area was further understood and key
controls over the corresponding risks then sought.

For areas 4 - 6 (System Baseline Risks) we adopted a different approach, whereby the typical good practise
documentation requirements and project governance methods as stipulated by ‘Prince 2’ (amongst others) were
utilised as a baseline, and the approach to each of the sampled change initiatives assessed from the available
documentation. This work was conducted through a mixture of verbal discussion and the receipt of supporting
evidence where applicable.

Activity 6: Peer Comparison to Assurance Available to Similar Organisations

As part of our analysis we have also assessed whether the IT Provision assurance POL has obtained is
proportionate to that provided to similar organisations.

We have also considered the best practice approach outlined by the COSO framework, as published by The
Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission, in formulating suggestions for potential
areas of improvement in the risk, control and assurance activities of POL.

4 Understanding the Horizon Processing
Environment

Overview of the Processing Environment

The Horizon IT system was designed specifically for POL, and therefore an understanding of its operations,
processing environment and configuration was required in order to fully quantify the risks applicable to the IT
components of the processing environment.

Horizon has been the main operational system of POL since 1995 and:
« Has a user base of 68,000 users;
¢ Terminals within 11,500 branches;
* | Processes an average of 6 million transactions a day; and
¢ Interfaces with over 20 third party systems.

As highlighted in our ‘Approach’ section above, we have categorised the risks posed on the system into three
distinct areas (System Baseline Risk, IT Provision Risk and System Usage Risk), and the remainder of this section
outlines our understanding of the IT system that underpins these.

System Baseline Risk
Horizon (HNG-X) Project

The change to the HNG-X system in 2010 was governed using Royal Mail's “Harmony” project methodology (the
governing project standard at the time). The project saw the phased implementation over 18 months of the HNG-X
solution (also known as “Horizon On-Line”). Individual POL Branches were migrated from the Legacy System to the
new HNG-X system, one by one.

No historical data was migrated, although six months of data was maintained within the Legacy System. Our review
of Assurance Work shows that a number of key controls were operated over the project, which was managed by
Fujitsu on behalf of POL. These included:

* POL signing off acceptance criteria;

« Aphased migration including a model office pilot; and

e Branch by branch reconciliation between opening balances on the new system and closing balances on the
legacy system.

Wipro, an independent third party, were commissioned to provide a report on the performance testing strategy
including gap analysis and recommendations, and Gartner provided an assessment of the overall system design
and strategy.

The benefits from the migration included the removal of transactional data being held at local branches levels and
this data instead being stored centrally within the data centres.

Data Strategy Foundation Project

The project focused on moving the Accounts Payable file feed which was initially received into Credence via
Transaction Integrator to processing via Fujitsu Horizon systems (i.e. not the Counter). The goal of the project was

|

POL00107160
POL00107160

to provide a longer term system solution which would provide complete reconciliation, resilience and disaster
recovery capabilities, as well as reduce the risk of client withdrawal.

The POL strategic requirements to expand its offerings to other platforms beyond Horizon introduced the
requirement for a data integrator function. Originatiy POL approached Fujitsu Services to supply this service as
plans to incorporate an integrator service within the Horizon architecture were considered to represent a clean
solution. However, Fujitsu Services were unable to respond within the desired timescales as it would have diverted
their resources from key Horizon on-line delivery milestones.

POL therefore investigated alternative options, finally selecting the use of IBM datastage as the Transaction
Integrator. This was delivered as part of the POLMI project. Fujitsu Services then submitted a high level design
proposal for the provision of a service for processing client transaction files which would provide end-to-end data
validation / reconciliation, with resilience and DR (the incumbent IBM datastage solution did not provide resilience,
DR or end to end reconciliation, presenting a threat to relationships and future contracts).

Assurance Work provided included:

e Project overview document;

e Business Case;

« Weekly Project Meeting Committee Presentation;
« Business Requirements;

« = Test Strategy;

«Test Sign off; and

e Test Report.

Audit Store Changes

In assessing change risks in relation to the Audit Store, documentation has asserted that the recent significant
changes above did not result in significant changes to the operation of the day-to-day Counter transaction flows or
the operation of the-Audit Store.

To assess Baseline risk for the Audit Store the original implementation documentation for the Audit Store was
requested. Due to the data retention policy this documentation could not be provided and so a review of Fujitsu
provided documentation over subsequent changes over a large period of the Audit Store’s history was performed.

In producing the diagram on page 9, we have considered the key System Baseline Risks in the context of two
control assertions below, which became the overall focus of our work in this System Baseline area:

* The Horizon Features were fit for purpose and worked as intended when first implemented; and
e Major changes since implementation have not significantly impacted the Horizon Features.

IT Provision Risk

As part of our work, through review of documentation and discussions with subject matter experts in POL, we
familiarised ourselves with the topology and operations of the Horizon IT system.

The systems documentation and understanding obtained (shown in summary in diagrams below) highlights the
complexity of the Horizon IT system and the level of data being transacted via batch and real-time data flow. This
volume and level of complexity in the data flows, including interactions with other systems, highlights the
importance of effective IT Provisioning controls to the integrity of the processing environment.

The Horizon IT system is built in line with key principles that all data is held centrally within the data centre with the
exception of some standing data which is held locally within the branch. This centralisation principle applies to all
‘completed’ transactional data (known as “baskets") and to the Audit Store.

To support this principle the network architecture of Horizon is formulated on:

« Data centre;
« WAN Services (connecting datacentres, POL central sites, and Fujitsu sites); and
e Branch Network.

Managing the processing of the real-time and batch processing environment is Tivoli Workflow Scheduler (TWS)
which is used to execute, monitor and handle exceptions within the processing environment. TWS is managed and
monitored by Fujitsu as part of the managed service contract between the two parties.

In producing the diagram on page 9, we have considered the IT Provisioning risks in the context of the following
assertion:

¢ Supporting IT management processes are well controlled.

System Usage Risk

Responsibility for the administration of the system rests with Fujitsu who provide change control, security
management, system operations, and end-user support.

Responsibility for the effective usage of the system, including complaint and effective business processes, remains
the responsibility of POL.

The user base of Horizon can be subdivided into two core areas:

* Central Users — including Finance, and users at the Network Business Support Centre. ,
e Branch Users — Sub-postmasters and their staff who are processing shop floor transactions.

Outside of the POL user base, Fujitsu provide administration services, and hold service and super user account
privileges within the system.

Horizon supports the processing of a multitude of different transactions including:
e Purchases of goods;
Purchases of services (for example Lottery tickets or tax discs);
Payments to discharge customer debts (payment of mobile phone bills for example);
Refunds; and
Transaction corrections.

Several transaction mediums are accepted, for example:

e Cash;
¢ Credit and debit cards; and
e Cheques.

A number of controls are in place to support the integrity of transactional processing including:

e The Audit Store, a secure area of Horizon which pertains to store all transactional information in
sequentially numbered records, along with key system events;

¢ Monitoring controls 'facilitated by Tivoli Workflow Scheduler and associated exception handling processes;

¢ Handshakes and call offs between systems include various controls around the integrity of transmitted
data (such as digital signatures); and

¢ Backup communication routes between branches and the central data centre (mobile technology).

Reconciliations are performed regularly both in branch and centrally. Key reconciliation processes carried out
include:

* Daily branch cash declaration and reconciliation to Horizon balances;
« Weekly balance of cash and stock and reconciliation to Horizon balances;

e Monthly trading period roll over (including resolution of any suspense account issues rolling over from
weekly or daily reconciliations); and

¢ Central finance processes to reconcile central records to cash remitted to POL, cheques remitted to POL
etc.

In response to discrepancies as a result of these reconciliation processes investigations may be conducted by the
Finance Service Centre, and if required transactional corrections processed. These corrections are subject to
significant investigation and are subject to approval by Sub-postmasters in the first instance.

questions posed within the scope of our work, and refined these risks into the following control assertions: a

5 Assessment of Assurance Sources

IT Provision Risk Assurance Sources / Gap Analysis

For the IT Provision risks the existing assurance sources appear to provide a good level of coverage over the risk
universe associated with this area of the Horizon processing environment.

Our high-level analysis of this coverage against the three core risk areas is as follows:

Information Security Information System

Operations

Change Management

18027001 Statement of Good coverage Fair coverage Fair Coverage
Applicability

ISAE3402 Report Good coverage

PCI DSS Report Good coverage Fair coverage

Detailed analysis at an objective level is included within Appendix 1.

In considering this assessment, POL management should be cognisant of the inherent limitations of each report,
given the purpose for which it was written:

Applicability noted however that it is supported by an independent assessment of IS027001 compliance by Bureau Veritas, an
. accredited certification provider.

The main focus of 1$027001 is on security, although it does also focus (to a lesser degree) on the other core IT
Provision risk areas, Change Management and information System Operations.

ISAE3402 Report This document has been produced by an independent third party, Ernst and Young. It has good coverage of all three
IT Provision risk areas, and is produced according to testing standards stipulated within the ISAE3402 standard.

In relying on this report management has considered ‘Section 6 Complimentary User Entity Controls’ which
stipulates the controls that POL should be operating in addition to the controls at Fujitsu in order to complete the
control environment over Horizon.

PCI DSS Report The scope of the PCI DSS report is the narrowest of the three assurance reports. It is focused exclusively on the
‘security of cardholder data, and does not span the other two IT Provisioning risk areas to the degree of the other
assurance sources. It provides minimal coverage in particular of the Information Systems Operations System
Provisioning risk.

Of note when considering coverage of IT Provision assurance sources is that the majority of the focus is over
Information Security, whereby based upon the historical issues and allegations being levelled at the system,

Baseline Risk Assurance Sources / Gap Analysis
Our assessment of Baseline Risk was based upon three core scope areas:
e Horizon Project;

e Data Strategy Foundation Project; and
e Audit Store Changes.

For each of these scope areas we queried relevant POL and Fujitsu personnel in order to understand the project
and change governance documentation available, and form an assessment as to the project controls applied to
these change events, compared to Deloitte’s Project Management methodology.

Our findings are as follows:

Baseline Risk Assurance Work Information Provided

Area

Audit Store Changes to Horizon, such as the migration to HNG-X in 2010 involved minimal changes to the operation of the Audit Store. As
a result these large scale projects are of minimal interest with regards to establishing a Baseline Risk position in relation to the

design and functioning of Horizon Features relating to Audit Store.

Some small changes have been made to the Audit Store in more recent years. Samples of documentation correlating to
changes throughout the years the Audit Store had been in place were requested in order to understand whether these
changes to the system had been managed to good practise standards.

Further at the point of implementation of the Audit Store verbal representation was provided that a ‘Security Report’ was
produced which pertained to demonstrate that the functionality of the system was as designed. This would be a key piece of
Assurance Work, demonstrating the correct functionality of the Audit Store at that point in time, but it could not be located by
POL and thus could not be reviewed as part of our work.

HNG-X Implementation Detailed business and technical design documents have been verbally represented to have been created during the delivery of
(2010) the project life cycle.

Detailed test plans, MI, Defect Management and other key testing artefacts were produced during the course of the project.
Several acceptance criteria related to the closure of testing defects. Examples of testing documentation have been provided to
our review team during the course of our work.

Migration checklists and instructions have been provided. These illustrate that site visits would be conducted during the

migration to support the Sub-postmaster with the migration and support the resolution of any queries.

We have been provided with verbal representation that detailed project acceptance criteria were agreed between Fujitsu and
POL, and then signed off during the lifecycle of the project. An example of such acceptance criteria in relation to Non-

Functional Requirements has been provided to us to support this verbal representation,

Data Strategy Foundation | Detailed business and technical design documents have been verbally represented to have been created during the delivery of
Project the project life cycle.

Assurance Work was provided to demonstrate business scoping and approval of changes to be applied (including a benefits
realisation and costings map), requirements tracker document, testing strategy plan, testing report plan and migration
summary documents. We were also provided with an example of the weekly reporting process at project close which
demonstrated the level of governance and oversight the project had from senior stakeholders.

POL00107160
POL00107160

Summarising the work we have performed against Baseline risk we conclude that for each sampled change,
Assurance Work has been produced in accordance with defined change management or project methodologies.
We have not however been furnished with all key items of documentation we would have liked to review, due to the
availability of such documentation to POL, and much of the Assurance Work provided to us were confirmations of
verbal representations made during our work.

Further work will be required to perform a ‘deep dive’ review of project and change documentation on particular
high risk areas (for example the original implementation of the audit store, and acceptance criteria sign off for the
Branch Database commissioning as part of the Horizon HNG-X Implementation project), in order to provide
assurance that the system baseline position were appropriately implemented and tested (timeframes of such
positions varying depending on the component of the system under investigation).

Assessment of Assurance against System Usage Risk Areas

Our assessment in each of these areas is based upon information contained within system documentation from
Fujitsu and operational policy and procedure documentation from the finance service centre, as well as emails
confirming verbal assertions we received during the course of our work.

No testing or independent sources of assurance were identified over these System Usage risk areas.

Our understanding of the design of Horizon Features responding to key risks is a core output of our work and is
outlined within Appendix 2 where we have provided a documentary listing of all of the Horizon features.

6 Matters for Consideration

In this section we set out our key matters for management consideration, further to the work we have performed
above.

We have structured this section as follows:
e Key Matters for Consideration, by Risk Area reviewed;

« Factors to Consider in Formulating an Action Plan; and
« Proposed Action Plan.

Key Matters for Consideration

Nature of
Risk Area Key Matters for Consideration Assurance

Work

a. Risk Appetite: During our work, only occasional linkage of work to the risk appetite of POL
was noted. Whilst not unusual in the consumer business sector, such articulation and
embedding of risk appetite assists with the delivery of better optimised and prioritised key
controls and assurance activities.

b. Holistic Risk and Assurance Framework: A holistic, risk intelligent assessment relating to
a) the identification and mitigation of key risks to the integrity of processing should be
considered in order to validate the completeness of the Horizon Features referred to in our Na
General work and thus provide a complete schedule of key controls that require assurance. Whilst

Assurance Work has been provided demonstrating the use of key forums for tracking the
tisk environment surrounding Horizon (such as the Information Security Management Forum
and Fujitsu Services Security Reports), these aren't set up to specifically consider the
holistic risk and assurance framework necessary to enable an overall comment on the
design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the Horizon Features.

p>

Project Governance: Governance procedures described to us (verbally) suggest that the
expected levels of business involvement in pre-go live system and user acceptance testing
is performed as part of system implementation projects over the Horizon IT system; and that
business users would be appropriately involved in signing off of system requirements and
readiness to go-live (full system reconciliations). To supplement these verbal assurances,
management has provided us with samples of documentation from the three sampled
change areas (Horizon Implementation, Data Strategy Foundation, and Audit Store
changes). Despite these sources of evidence, management should consider whether further

) investigations into sources of assurance from the original Horizon implementation would be Verbal
worthwhile, given the importance of establishing a well-founded baseline position over the Tepresentations
Horizon Features. imi
geen Limited
b. Audit Store Baseline: The implementation of Horizon HNG-X in 2010-11 was asserted to | documentation

not have had a significant impact on the Horizon Features. In particular no changes were
made to the Audit Store as a result of the implementation. Therefore the ‘baseline’ position
for the Audit Store was established as being at the original implementation of the Horizon IT
system. Key documentation around the baseline position for the Audit Store has not been
able to be provided to us during the course of our work. We note that a security report was
verbally represented to us to have been commissioned during the original implementation of
the Audit Store, although this report could not be located and provided to us.

POL00107160

Nature of
Risk Area Key Matters for Consideration Assurance

Work

a. End User Entity Control Considerations: The ISAE3402 report requires interpretation in
the context of these controls at POL. They are outlined in section 6 of the ISAE3402 report.
Without such analysis, the assurance provided by the ISAE3402 is weakened. We are
aware that POL has nearly completed work in order to address such considerations.

s

. Assurance Clarifications: In the context of detailed testing and assurance procedures,
there are areas of the ISAE3402 report which would benefit from further clarification, in order
to remove the risk of ambiguity from its interpretation, and overlaps with other sources of
assurance that may be performed. For example:

© the report does not state from where populations of data tested in samples were
obtained and thus how exposed conclusions may be to internal fraud or deliberate
override of contro! (e.g. for change management testing, were samples picked from the

population in the secure Audit Store, or from another source?); Extensive
3) documentation
8) © _ the report does not draw out certain key features in the control design, which we would
iT assume are present, for example, contro! objective 4.8.11 (relating to access to the Independent
Provision system being restricted to appropriate users) does not explicitly state and test that users testing

must have and use their own unique username, thus underpinning audit trail integrity;
and controls relating to the management of administrator access could be more specific
as to the extent and nature of the design of controls and testing performed.

© the report is not explicit in the sample sizes used for testing; and

© the report contains tests which could be strengthened, for example, control test 6.5 in
section 7 appears to test through discussion with personnel only, without clarifying if
anything was done to corroborate such verbal assertions.

9

. Internal Audit Work — Internal audit work conducted highlights progress in responding to
and closing down issues in relation to internal audit risks, but a number of issues remain
outstanding. Internal audit have also not done any specific assurance work over the
allegations being raised on the Horizon system and POL’s response to the issues raised.

Risk Driven Considerations: The current documentation over System Usage Risks has
been largely written in response to key incidents or events, by non-independent parties and
from operational perspectives. Whilst detalled, itis also not written from a risk and
assurance perspective and is rarely evidential in its content.

La

Risk and Control Framework: There are ateas where an understanding of the design and
nature of operations relating to System Usage Risks is available, but the design,
implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls has not been aggregated into a
risk driven framework nor formally assured through evidence based testing. Further, the
ability of documentation to fully support information relating to the detailed design of controls
relating to System Usage Risks is unclear (e.g. whilst JSNs are sequential is there a
systems operations contro! which checks the completeness of this sequence proactively?).
‘The Schedule of Assurance over Horizon Features we have formulated as part of our work
(and documented in Appendix 2) provides a basis for such a risk and control framework, as
well as targeted testing over key controls. Management should consider enhancing their
assurance provision by verifying the completeness of this schedule, and conducting
implementation and operating effectiveness testing of the key controls there-in. Partial

that the current capturing of certain, key system events, is complete and appropriate for
potential governance and investigation needs;

Nature of
Risk Area Key Matters for Consideration Assurance

Work

© Investigatory work on the Audit Store has all been performed by Fujitsu who, whilst
technically qualified, do not constitute an independent or risk experienced party for
assurance driven purposes. POL could consider doing more independent analysis of
Audit Store historic data to verify that it is recorded in line with expected characteristics;
and

© From the documentation we have reviewed, controls to assess that the digital signature
is valid and verify that there is a complete sequence of JSNs are retrospective. No
proactive checks wete documented which describe the performance of such verifications
prior to the copying of data to the Audit Store.

e. Proactive monitoring of key System Usage Risks: The current assurance environment
appears to be “reactive” in nature, with exceptions in processing triggering diagnostic and
remediation activity only when reported. It would appear that no use is being made of the
Audit Store, for proactive monitoring of unusual or exceptional system events potentially
worthy of further investigation and action.

Hardware controls over the Audit Store: The Centera EMC devices used to host Audit
Store data have not been configured in the most secure EC+ configuration. As a result
system administrators on these boxes may be able to process changes to the data stored
within the Audit Store, if other altemative software controls around digital seals, and key
management are not adequately segregated from Centera box administration staff.
Privileged access to the cryptographic solution around digital signatures, and publically
available formulas on MDS hashed digital seals would potentially allow privileged users at
Fujitsu to delete a legitimate sealed file, and replacement with a ‘fake’ file in an undetectable
manner.

e

Branch Database: We observed the following in relation to the Branch Database being:

© —Amethod for posting ‘Balancing Transactions’ was observed from technical
documentation which allows for posting of additional transactions centrally without the
requirement for these transactions to be accepted by Sub-postmasters (as ‘Transaction
Acknowledgements’ and ‘Transaction Corrections’ require). Whilst an audit trail is
asserted to be in place over these functions, evidence of testing of these features is not
available;

© Processes around Transaction Acknowledgements and Transaction Corrections are
‘subject to out of date documentation, or in the case of Transaction acknowledgements,
no documentation at all. Such documentation should be produced or brought up to date;

° For ‘Balancing Transactions’, ‘Transaction Acknowledgments’, and ‘Transaction
Corrections’ we did not identify controls to routinely monitor all centrally initiated
transactions to verify that they are alll initiated and actioned through known and
governed processes, or controls to reconcile and check data sources which underpin
current period transactional reporting for Subpostmasters to the Audit Store record of
‘such activity;

© Security on the Branch Database around the ‘Messaging Journal table’ is a key area of
risk due to branch transactional data being held on this table for up to a day before being
written to the Audit Store. It was unclear from the documentation reviewed whether
‘specific assurance work had been carried out in this area; and

© Controls that would detect when a person with authorised privileged access used such
access to send a ‘fake’ basket into the digital signing process could not be evidenced to
exist. .

Recommendations

We have identified three areas where POL should consider further actions to strengthén the quality and nature of
assurance in place over the Horizon system.

These are actions that may:

e Further support Project Sparrow;
¢ Integrate knowledge obtained from this work into the Future System Requirements project; and
« Help POL to move towards a more holistic Programme of Assurance.

We have aligned each of the actions we would recommend to POL management to one of these areas, and we
present these below.

Actions that may help POL move towards a more holistic programme of Assurance Des we -
This area is the more significant piece of work recommended in a broad context for POL to consider as a result of
our assessment.

The development of such a holistic assurance programme should be seen as a ‘strategic’ response to the issues
raised. If delivered successfully it will bring assurance benefits beyond the confines of assuring the integrity of
processing within Horizon.

Whilst not raised specifically below, such an exercise would first require the appointment of a role in POL who
would be responsible for the coordination of assurance across the whole organisation and the reporting of key
areas where assurance provision could be improved (a “Head of Assurance”). This would ensure that POL
Management and the Board have the ability to map, coordinate and assess assurance sources (and their quality)

Notes:

"Risk Workshop: Risk appetite statements may be considered as part of this exercise, but are typically found by
key stakeholders to be a different area to understand. Such statements are effectively matters which help an
organisation to avoid imprecise or open statements relating to risk, which do not assist with the effective
management of responses to such risks. Statements are mechanisms that also help management to define
parameters relating to risk, against which key decisions and escalation activities can be performed.

‘Key risk indicators’ are often a tool used by management, and those in charge of Governance, in these areas.
Whilst POL needs to consider their own risk statements and indicators, some examples of those that may be
worthy of consideration in relation to the integrity of processing in Horizon could include:

* The number of allegations or concerns raised by Sub-postmasters during a defined period;
e® The number and value of adjustment postings being performed by FSC

e The use of balancing transactions

* The number of security incidents on the Horizon system during a defined period;

e The value of unreconciled differences between systems / ledgers

* The number and nature of errors or exceptions in processing; and

¢ Key controls found to not to be operating effectively in a period.

The above are not exhaustive and key risk indicators need to be considered thoroughly in response to the
particular risks and controls which are required in response to the risk universes formulated over the Horizon
processing environment.

Sustain Assurance Delivery and Implement more Proactive Monitoring: Benefits of these activities could
include:

*  Minimising duplication in the control framework, and the assurance activities there-on;

« Support targeted assurance provision in the context of existing or potential future allegations;

e Provide more measureable benchmarks of performance against other organisations;

« Underpin further efficiencies in the assurance provision, for example the automation of existing manual
controls; .

e — Incentivise ongoing improvement in both the processes and the assurance provision, by highlighting
deficiencies on a timely basis and reporting these directly back to those business or outsourced
owners who need to take a remediation or corrective action; and

* Support the maintenance of the completeness of documentation over the Horizon Features.

Appendix 2: Assurance Schedule over Horizon Features

We present below a schedule of the Assurance Work and sources we have identified which relate to certain groups of Horizon Features.
We have structured these in line with our three areas of assessment (System Baseline, IT Provision and System Usage), as defined in our report.
We have also recorded our assessment of the level of comfort that POL has over that Horizon Feature, defined as:

« “Significant” means we have seen Assurance Work that delivers comfort through evidence based testing by independent parties.

« “Partial” means we have seen Assurance Work in the form of descriptions in formal documentation, but no testing of implementation or operating effectiveness.
« “Limited” means we have seen Assurance Work that documents verbal assertions we received during our work.

e “None” means that Assurance Work has not yet been provided to us.
