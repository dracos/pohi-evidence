   Hi Jarnail,

  Thanks for this, would it be possible to get the bullets Rodric sent below with the correct numbers in?

           -      the trial being a fully contested adversarial proceeding, with X number of witnesses (including experts) being
                  cross examined;
           -      that no appeal was ever pursued against conviction or sentence or both (or if it was, how far it went)
           -      the implications of a jury verdict (e.g. that it's 12 people unanimously agreeing that all elements of the
                  offences were proved beyond reasonable doubt etc.)?

  Your para is too emotive for us to use and so a factual account as above would be best.

  Thanks
  Sophie

Hi — the Comms Team might need a bit more to help them tell our side of the story (Sophie — please correct me if I'm
wrong!).

Is there any more detail you could provide, e.g. around:

    -       the trial being a fully contested adversarial proceeding, with X number of witnesses (including experts) being
           cross examined;
    -       that no appeal was ever pursued against conviction or sentence or both (or if it was, how far it went)
    -       the implications of a jury verdict (e.g. that it's 12 people unanimously agreeing that all elements of the

Something on the lines of;
Seema Misra was subpostmistress at West Byfleet. She was accused of stealing £74,609.84, between 2005
and 2008. On 21/10/10, after a 7 day trial, she was found guilty by the jury of the theft.

Thanks so much Lena. Rodric / Jarnail would you be able to provide me with a bullet or two on the legal position e.g.
unanimous guilty verdict by jury or whatever it would be.

Hi Sophie,

We haven't got that much information as there is not CQR yet. But I imagine that the legal team will have the criminal
case files — so Jarnail should be able to provide a breakdown of the merits of the case. As far as the scheme is
concerned, this is a summary of what we have:

    •     Seema Misra was in post from 25`h June 2005 to January 2009 at the West Byfleet branch.
    •     MP at the time of her application was Jonathan Lord.
    •     Incidents reportedly occurred in the summer of 2005.
    •     No specific references to Horizon issues — cites lack of support as the main factor leading to the losses.
    •     Alleges that PO threatened her and used mental torture.
    •     Howe and Co represented —funding agreement signed in November.
    •     Still waiting on a CQR from the applicant — apparently SS have it for refinement.

Thanks!
Lena
