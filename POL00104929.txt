proportionate to the alleged offence and its seriousness.

that document within the context of all relevant supporting documentation and must apply the EPP's
principles whenever they make an enforcement decision for which they have the authority and
formally record the outcome and rationale/ reasoning.

Line Managers must:

e Ensure staff are competent to make enforcement decisions within the limits of their authority,
in accordance with and through the appropriate application of the EPP;
