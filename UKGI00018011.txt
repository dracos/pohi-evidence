and the value of reversed stamps out of the Horizon system was £17638.

By reversing out stamps with a value of £14802.50 you are putting the stamps back into
the stock holdings and therefore increasing the number of stamps declared at the branch. As
the level of stock has increased the amount of cash required to balance the branch would
reduce by the same value. For example increasing the stamp holdings with a value of
£14,802.50 would then reduce the cash required to balance the cash and stock at the
branch by £14,802.50.

SB/4 is referred to as adjustments to stock, the difference between the declared levels of
stock on hand compared to the actual stock levels on hand has to be sold to balance the
correct amount of stock held.

For example on SB/10 the last completed Branch Trading Statement on 12 January 2011,
the volume of 50 x 2™ class stamps held was declared as 278. On SB/3 the Horizon
snapshot print out, which indicates the amount of stock that should be on hand shows that
the volume of 50 x 2™ class stamps held was 277, indicating that one sheet of 50 x an
class stamps was sold between 12 January 2011 and the close of business on 7 February
2011. On completion of the audit the volume of 50 x 2"4 class stamps transferred to the
interim sub postmaster was 117 making a difference of 160 between what they said they

held at the branch to the actual volume of stamps held.

Continuation of statement of Stephen BRADSHAW

This difference in volume can be seen on SB/4 and amounted to a cash value of £4080
being over stated. The total value of stock that had to be sold on 8 February 2011 to
balance the stock held at Birkenshaw Post Office branch was £17,961.18.

It can be seen on the Branch Trading Statements SB/7 to SB/10 for the 50 x 2 class
stamps that on SB/7 the volume was 110, SB/8 the volume was 139 SB/9 the volume was
279 SB/10 the volume was 278. The figure of 278 is reduced by one on the Horizon office
snapshot print out SB/3.

For the period of 02 November 2010 to 31 January 2011 (SB/21) a total of 21 sheets of 50
x 2"4 class stamps with a value of £535.50 have been sold but a total of 160 50 x 2™ class
stamps with have a value of £4080 have been reversed out of the Horizon thus increasing

the level of 50 x 2" class stamps held by a volume of 160.

From business records Birkenshaw Post Office branch was audited and the cash and
stock accepted by Mr Khayyam ISHAQ as the incumbent sub postmaster in July 2005.
The next audit was in February 2011 when Mr ISHAQ was suspended and a
discrepancy in the accounts was discovered.

The cash and stock was then transferred to an interim sub postmaster in February 2011
and accepted as being correct.

The cash and stock was again transferred to a new interim sub postmaster in
September 2012. During the subsequent transfer of cash and stock after Mr ISHAQ’s

suspension in February 2011 no problems or discrepancies have been reported.

the discrepancy, i.e. Cash, Cheque or provide you with an option to settle the
discrepancy centrally if over £150. If this option is selected, then you will receive a
statement from our accounting team in Chesterfield which provides you with the
additional option of paying by credit or debit card. If the discrepancy is due to a
known specific error made at the branch, then contact NBSC with the details to
enable further accounting investigations to be made and appropriate accounting
corrections to be issued. You
do not need to ‘make good’ after each weekly balance, but you MUST make good
at the end of your Trading Period.
