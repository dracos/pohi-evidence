Dear Mr Bates,

RE: LOSSES AND GAINS

Thank you for your letter of the 16 April 2003, the content of which has been noted,
Nevertheless, I must point out that you are Bound by the Terms and Conditions of your
Contract for Services, which was acknowledged by you on the 31 March 2003, when
accepting your appointment.

To this effect you are charged with ensuring that all accounts entrusted to you are kept
in the form prescribed by Post Office Ltd, by using the approved accounting system i.e
Horizon, and therefore, in the event of any losses occurring these should be made good
without delay (Section 12, Paragraph 4, Section 12, paragraph 12 refers).

Accordingly, failure to comply with these obligations can be construed as a Breach of
Contract, which could ultimately put your Contract for Services ‘at risk’.
