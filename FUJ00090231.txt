1.0 Introduction

This document is one of a set of three documents that describe the changes to the Horizon
User Interfaces resulting from the introduction of Impact Release 3 at the Post Office counter
(at BI3 $80). Each of the three documents covers a distinct set of requirements that are
documented in the high-level process models within the Conceptual Design EA/CDE/002.

Each process within the requirements document is depicted by a reference beginning with the
letter ‘A’. The requirements that have an impact on the Graphical User Interface, Reports or
Receipts are documented below:

1.1 Report Production

This is covered in EA/IFS/011 - Impact Release 3 - Report Production User Interface which
covers the following topics:

A4.1.2.2 Produce Periodic Summaries

Changes to the production of the office summary reports (with cut-offs). New
reports, removed reports and changes to report selection criteria.

A4.1.2.3 Produce Sales Report to Assist Remuneration Check

New functionality around the entry and validation of reporting criteria.

A4.1.2.6 Produce Other Horizon Reports

Changes to report layouts as a result of changes to the management of Stock and
changes associated with the menu hierarchy in regard to additional and removed
reports.

A4.1.7.1.3 Review Stock Held Across Branch

Changes incurred to the Office Snapshot Report

Report Reprints — (not identified within EA/CDE/002)

1.2 Declaration, Correction and Revaluation

This is covered in FA/IFS/012 - Impact Release 3 - Declaration, Correction and Revaluation
User Interface which covers the following topics:

A4.1.5.1 Receive Automated Message

Changes to the Logon process related to the presence of outstanding Transaction
Corrections.

A4.1.5.2 Handle Transactions Corrections

Selection and processing of Transaction Corrections.

A4.1.6.1 Compare Generated with Actual Cash Held for Stock Unit

Cash Declarations and Cash Variance identification for both Individual and
Shared Stock Units.

A4.1.6.2 Create Variance Report

Menu, Dialogue and Report format for the Cash Variance Report.

A4.1.6.3 Make Good or Hold Any Cash Variance & A4.1.7.4 Make Good any
Outstanding Variances

Menu items and dialogues associated with the recognition and resolution of Cash
Variances.

e A4.1.7.8 Stock Revaluation (Stamps)
Messages for clerk when revaluations are approaching.

1.3. Balancing and Trading Statement Production
This is covered by this particular document and covers the following topics:

e A4.1.7.2 Produce Trial Balance & 4.1.7.5 Produce Final Balance
Dialogue for order and content of warnings around new rollover constraints. This
will include all changes associated with both Individual and Shared Stock Unit
period rollovers as well as changes to the Office Rollover process.

e A4.1.7.6 Produce and Confirm Trading Statement.
The report layout of the of the new Trading Statement and dialogues associated to
the rollover confirmation

1.4 Scope

This document will describe the changes to the flow of activities, screen displays and
prompts, and report/receipt layouts at the counter as a result of the introduction of Impact
Release 3. This document shall limit that description to those items listed under section 1.3
above.

The primary purpose of the flow charts in this document is to define the User Interface, and in
particular, to define the sequence of screens displayed. They are not intended to be definitive
statements of the low-level design of the counter application.

This is a delta document that only describes changes incurred as a result of the
implementation of Impact Release 3. This document does not intend to narrate any part of the
system that exists at Release S75 and remains unchanged as a result of Impact Release 3.

This document will cover all aspects of the timeliness of change to the User Interfaces as a
result of the necessity to migrate the counter functionality across more than one migration
boundary.

It is felt that standard dialogues that show progress (for example: ‘Print in progress’) or show
failure of peripherals would simply confuse the readability of this document. Therefore, not
all the possible error or exception conditions are shown or described in the diagrams and
dialogues in this document.

1.4.1 DP Cross Reference

The scope of this document can be further defined by cross-reference to the Impact Release 3
Design Proposal EA/DPR/004. This document covers the following sections of the Design
Proposal:

1.4.2. Migration Points

The migration to the new dialogues at Release $80 will occur at three points.

a The first point occurs when the counter software and associated reference data is
distributed and made available to the Branches. With reference to TBA, this
migration point is referred to as ‘Point 20’

a The second point occurs when the final cash account is produced for the CBDB
accounting system and will have an effect on the Menu Hierarchy as well as incurring
some changes to the number and type of suspense products. With reference to TBA,
this migration point is referred to as ‘Point 30’.

a The third point occurs when the final cash account occurs at the Branch and this phase
incurs the majority of the changes described within this document. With reference to
TBA, this migration point is referred to as ‘Point 50’.

1.5 Structure of this document

This document is structured as follows:

Section 2 provides the list of new or changed User Interfaces that are within the scope of this
document. Where the dialogue involves more than one Screen (alternatively known as

2.0 Graphical User Interface Design

The transaction flows in this section show the points at which screens are displayed to the
Clerk. Although automated processes are shown within the diagram, they are for clarity only
and do not attempt to fully or accurately show the underlying logic of transaction processing.
The Screens are used to inform and prompt the Clerk at appropriate steps in the process of
each transaction.

2.1 Overview

This document describes the Counter Dialogues that are required to support Balancing and
Trading Statement Production. In summary, this includes:

= Stock unit balancing and the production of Final and Trial Balance reports
= Office balancing and the production of Branch Trading Statement

= Suspense changes as discussed at the workshop of 16" June 2004.

2.1.1 Stock Unit Balancing

This dialogue shown in 2.2 starts with the clerk touching the Bal Report [F6] button from the
Stock Balancing menu. The function consists of a series of sanitary checks to be carried out
prior to producing the Trial and Final Balance reports. Most of the checks that needed to be
carried out in the existing Horizon system have been carried forward into Impact Release 3:

The following changes have been introduced for Impact Release 3:

= rollovers will be based on a Trading Period that lasts 4 to 5 weeks instead of the
weekly CAP used in Horizon

= non value stock declarations will be removed and Stock Balancing will no longer
check that such declarations have taken place

= Stock units will no longer be allowed to carry discrepancies over and any
discrepancies will be moved into Local Suspense when the stock unit rolls over

Additional checks will be carried out for the final stock unit to roll over:

= The last stock unit will not be allowed to roll over if there are outstanding transaction
corrections

= Local suspense must be cleared and there are additional screens to support this process
See Impact Release 3 Design Proposal EA/DPR/004 section 2.5.1.4.

2.1.2 Office Balancing

This dialogue starts with the clerk touching the TP Report [F6] button from the Office
Balancing menu. The function consists of a series of sanitary checks that must be carried out
prior to producing the Branch Trading Statement. All of the checks that needed to be carried
out in the existing Horizon system have been carried forward into Impact Release 3 except for
the check that non value stock has been confirmed. No diagram is shown.

3.0 Reports and Receipts

This section depicts the layout of the Reports and Receipts following the introduction of
requirements introduced by the Impact Release 3 Conceptual design (Fujitsu reference
EA/CDE/002) and constrained to the functionality described in section 1.2.

It should be noted that the examples below attempt to reflect the final formats of the Reports
and Receipts although changes to layouts depicted below may or may not be incurred by other
influences or requirement changes. The definitive statement of Report and Receipt layout is
documented in SD/DES/005.

3.1. Branch Trading Statement — Summary Page

3.1.1 Purpose

This is an office report and must be retained. It provides the trading position for the branch
for the whole Trading Period. It supersedes the Cash Account at Impact Release 3.

It is covered in section 2.5.1.4.2 of EA/DPR/004 - Impact Release 3 Design Proposal and in
Section 20.1 of EA/CDE/002 - IMPACT - Branch Trading Reporting, Management and
Control and Transaction Management.

3.1.2 Frequency

Automatically produced on office rollover into a new Trading Period

3.1.3. Notes

DN

Line 13 Remittance in Total combines the following which were separately listed in the
Conceptual Design: Remittance In (Cash), Remittance In (Other Stamps), Remittance In
(ForEx)

Line 19 Remittance Out Total combines the following which were separately listed in the
Conceptual Design: Remittance Out (Cash), Remittance Out (Other Stamps), Remittance Out
(ForEx)

1. £ signs are not printed (this is consistent with the other reports of the system but is
contrary to what was shown in EA/CDE/002

2. minus (-) signs are trailing

3. Acolumn is shown for each operational stock unit in the branch: the stock unit
columns appear in alphabetical sequence. These will be preceded by a column for the
branch total and a column for suspense items. The manager’s stock unit can appear in
any position

3.1.4

The data in each column is based on the details recorded when each Stock Unit rolled
over into the next trading period. The first column provides an Office Total and is
obtained by summing the values in the row, including the suspense column. If there
are too many columns to fit on a single page, then additional pages are required. Each
page will repeat the Row headings, however there is no need for subtotals to be
carried forward from one page to the next — the first column of the first page will
contain the Office totals. On additional pages, the space released by not repeating the
branch and suspense totals will be occupied by stock unit details

The first page shows sufficient space for up to 4 stock units' and subsequent pages
will allow space for 6 stock units.

The report title will change depending upon the circumstance under which the report
is produced:
= if the trial statement is being printed line 3 will contain ‘Trial Branch Trading
Statement - Office Copy From dd/mm/yyyy To dd/mm/yyyy’
= if the final statement is being produced line 3 will contain ‘Final Branch
Trading Statement - Office Copy From dd/mm/yyyy To dd/mm/yyyy’
= if the final statement is being reprinted (via the Reprint Facility) line 3 will
contain ‘Final Branch Trading Statement - Office Copy From dd/mm/vyyy To
dd/mm/yyyy’ and line 2 will contain the additional fields (Reprint for hh.mm
dd/mm/yyyy) in addition to the date and time when the reprinted report is
produced.

The heading shows the start and end dates of the Trading period: these show the dates
the that the first stock unit rolled over from the previous Trading Period and the date
that the last stock unit rolled over into the following Trading Period.

Lines 6 to 33 are related to figures which are used to calculate the Trading Position
but lines 35 to 43 provide management information.

Sequence
Vertically as shown.

Stock units will appear across the page(s) in alphabetical sequence.

' The first page will allow details of up to 4 stock units though the example only shows 3 stock units.

3.2 Branch Trading Statement — Stock Holdings

3.2.1 Purpose

Forms the second part of the Branch Trading Statement, which must be retained. These two
parts form one report, they are not separate reports. It provides the stock holding position for
the branch at the end of the Trading Period.

It is covered in section 2.5.1.4.2 of EA/DPR/004 - Impact Release 3 Design Proposal and in
Section 20.1 of EA/CDE/002 - IMPACT - Branch Trading Reporting, Management and
Control and Transaction Management.

3.2.2. Frequency

Automatically produced on rollover into a new Trading Period

3.2.3 Notes

All pages of the Branch Trading Statement summary are printed before this/these pages. The
number of pages will depend on the number of stock items held at the branch.

Volume Figures are calculated by summing stock items volumes held across all stock units
within the branch.
3.2.4 Sequence

Sequence of stock items is the same as is used for generating the stock holding sections of the
stock unit balance reports.

The stock items will be listed down the first column until line 38 and then moved down the
next column, if there are more than 90 (3 columns of 30) stock item lines to be included an
extra page will be produced for items 91-180 (and another for items 181-270, and so on).

The last page will include:
= aspace line following the last stock holding line
= a line showing the number of Transaction corrections applied during the period
= another space line
= three further lines for the declaration and signature
= another space line

= the end of report marker.

4.0 Screen Layouts
4.1 Stock Balancing Menu

This screen is the entry point to Stock Unit Balancing. The screen is accessed by the clerk
touching the Stock Balancing button [F4] from the Top Level menu.

Changes are being made to the Stock Balancing menu for Impact Release 3:

= the Fgn Currency [F 13] button will be moved elsewhere: (to the Counter Daily
Reports menu)

= the Decl Non Val [F11] button will be removed

= anew button for Check for Variances will be added

= anew button to Make Good Loss will be added

= anew button to Remove Excess Cash will be added

= CAP will be changed to TP in the bottom right hand side of the screen.

The revised Stock Balancing menu is described in SD/SPE/016 v33.1 - Horizon OPS Menu
Hierarchy and the functionality of the new buttons is described in EA/IFS/012 Impact Release
3 - Declaration Correction and Revaluation User Interface.

4.2 Stock Unit Balancing Rollover

4.2.1 All Stock Units

The rollover process is invoked by the clerk touching the Balance Report [F6] button on the
Stock Balancing Menu.

The rollover process in the current Horizon system carries out a number of sanitary checks
before allowing the stock unit to roll over. These checks are carried out in the following
sequence and will remain for Impact Release 3:

= that all outstanding inter stock unit transfers are complete for that stock unit
= that all mandatory summary reports have been printed
= that all necessary declarations have been carried out

= that there are no outstanding discrepancies: the current Horizon system allows these to
be carried over into the next CAP, but this will not be allowed at Impact Release 3

= that there are no negative Stock holdings in the stock unit (see 4.2.5)

Failure of some of these checks will abort the rollover process. But so long as they are all
satisfied the trial balance report is produced and the stock unit is allowed to roll over.

The rollover process at Impact Release 3 will be similar but will have the following
differences: [BT-038]

= CAPs will be replaced by Trading Periods which last from 4 to 5 weeks

= Discrepancies may be written away to Local Suspense (see 4.2.10).

4.2.2 Last Stock Unit

Additionally, the current Horizon system checks whether this is the last stock unit to be
rolled: if it is the Counter checks whether Parcel Traffic details (see 4.2.4) have been entered
for the branch and will prevent the rollover happening unless these details have been entered.

For Impact Release 3 the following additional checks will take place for the last stock unit

= That all outstanding Transaction Corrections have been applied: this check will be
carried out at the start of the rollover immediately prior to the test for Parcel Traffic

= That no value remains in Local Suspense: this check will be carried out immediately
prior to the rollover. If values are detected in Local Suspense then they may be Made
Good at that time, (but only if the user is a Manager or Supervisor).

The last stock unit will only be allowed to roll over if both these tests are satisfied.

4.2.3 Outstanding Reports

The current Horizon system requires the clerk to print (or preview) a number of reports at the
end of the CAP and before the stock unit is rolled over. If the clerk touches the Balance
Report [F6] button on the Stock Balancing Menu and reports are outstanding the system
returns a warning screen “Outstanding Reports: One or more summaries have not been
produced. Continuing will present a list of them for information. Reports listed as
MANDATORY must be produced before you can balance.”

When the clerk touches the OK button on this screen the system returns the Summaries
Outstanding screen which is a pick list of the unprinted reports. The clerk can touch the
option on the screen to select the report he wants to print or use the [up] and [down] buttons
on the keyboard to select the required option. The pick list may span several screens and the
clerk can touch the up and down buttons at the right of the screen to display further options.

When the has selected his option and touches the Print [F1] button the counter displays a
Produce Report screen which allows him to print or preview the report.

The same mechanism will be used for Impact Release 3. No change will be made to any of
these existing Horizon screens except: [BT-015]

= they will be used at the end of the Trading Period instead of the CAP

= the DVL V10 report will no longer be listed as a report option

= the DVL V11 report will no longer be listed as a report option

= anew Counter Weekly Redeemed Savings Stamp Report will be treated as a
Mandatory report. This is a cut-off report that must be produced as part of balancing a
stock unit if any savings stamps have been redeemed during the Trading Period. The

* The system checks whether it is the last non default stock unit to be rolled over. The Default Stock Unit ‘DEF”
is not rolled over explicitly, but as part of the Office rollover.

This screen may be returned to the clerk if he touches the Balance Report [F6] button on the
Stock Balancing Menu. The screen is returned for the last stock unit to be rolled when there
are outstanding transaction corrections which have not yet been processed for the branch.

This is a new screen which will be introduced for Impact Release 3. This is similar to the
screen as described in HA/IFS/012 - Impact Release 3 - Declaration, Correction and
Revaluation User Interface where it is used to warn the post master when he logs on. But in
this context the screen has a single Continue button.

When the clerk touches Continue the counter returns to the Stock Balancing Menu: (the last
stock unit will not be able to roll over until all transaction corrections have been processed).

To process the Transaction Corrections the clerk will need to go via the Housekeeping menu
as described in EA/IF'S/012 - Impact Release 3 - Declaration, Correction and Revaluation
User Interface.

4.2.11 Local Suspense Outstanding for Branch

This is a new screen for Impact Release 3 which may be returned if the clerk touches the Next
TP [F1] button on the screen in Figure 9 - Rollover Selection Screen and the stock unit is in
the same Trading Period as the Branch. The screen is only retumed for the last stock unit to
be rolled when details of Local Suspense items are outstanding for the whole branch. (It is
possible for the last stock unit to roll over to display both the screen in Figure 11 —
Discrepancy Recorded as Local Suspense and the screen in Figure 12 - Local Suspense
Warning Screen).

This will be one of the last checks carried out in the stock unit rollover process.

The system calculates the nett figure for local suspense across all the stock units in the Branch
and if the value is zero the stock unit will be allowed to roll over and the Final Balance is
produced.

But if there is a loss (or gain) then a screen will be displayed similar to Figure 12 - Local
Suspense Warning Screen.

Figure 12 - Local Suspense Warning Screen
There will be alternative ways to resolve the Suspense total:

= Ifuser is a Manager / Supervisor who wants to resolve it immediately he may touch
Continue’ to return the screen in Figure 13 - Settle Local Suspense Screen.

© Managerial access rights also apply to emergency auditors and migrators. Ifa user with non managerial access
rights tries to touch the Continue button the counter will display a help bubble on the screen containing a
message “The current user does not have sufficient access to take this action”.

4.4 Office Balancing Menu

This screen is the entry point to Office Balancing. The screen is accessed by the clerk
touching the Office Balancing button [F8] from the Top Level menu.

This is an existing Horizon screen which will be changed for Impact Release 3:
= the [F2] button which confirms non value stock will be removed (eventually)
= the [F11] button which extends CAP will be removed [BT-045]
= the name of the [F6] button will be changed to Trading Statement
= the name of the [F10] button will be changed to Branch TP
= CAP will be changed to TP in the bottom right hand side of the screen

There are a number of tasks which need to be carried out before the branch can be rolled over:
most of them can be accessed by the buttons on the Office Balancing Menu.

The revised Office Balancing menu is described in SD/SPE/016 v33.1 - Horizon OPS Menu
Hierarchy.

4.5 Office Rollover

The rollover process is invoked by the clerk touching the Trading Statement [F6] button on
the Office Balancing Menu.

The rollover process in the current Horizon system carries out a number of sanitary checks
before allowing the branch to roll over. These checks are carried out in the following
sequence and will remain for Impact Release 3:

= all stock units must have rolled into the new period
= the mandatory suspense report must have been printed (CP 3787)

= non accounting data must have been entered. (This is optional, however the user does
need to confirm).

Failure of these checks will stop the rollover process. But so long as they are all satisfied the
trial Trading Statement will be produced and the Branch will be allowed to roll over.

The rollover process at Impact Release 3 will be similar but will have the following
differences: [BT-038]

= CAPs will be replaced by Trading Periods which last from 4 to 5 weeks

* the current Horizon system also includes a check for non-value stock but that has been
removed for Impact Release 3. [BT-063].

4.7.4 Local Suspense

One of the steps in the rollover process is to check the variances (discrepancies) and to warn
the clerk of their value. There are various ways he may be able to correct them but if all else
fails he will commit the discrepancy (see 4.2.10).

When the stock unit is rolled over into a new Trading Period any discrepancy is written as a
transaction to one of the two new products Gain to Local Suspense or Loss to Local
Suspense. (This will later appear on the Branch Trading Statement as Discrepancy OVER
Transferred or as Discrepancy SHORT Transferred for that stock unit).

When the last stock unit is rolled over into a new Trading Period the system will calculate the
nett figure for local suspense across all the stock units in the Branch. Only if this value is zero
will the clerk be able to roll this stock unit over into the new Trading Period. Otherwise, if the
value is not zero the clerk will be warned of the amount and whether it is a gain or a loss on
the screen shown in Figure 12 - Local Suspense Warming Screen.

The Manager / Supervisor may choose to investigate further by printing the suspense report
but if he is prepared to accept the figure then he can clear local suspense immediately by
using the screen shown in Figure 13 - Settle Local Suspense Screen: the value will be moved
automatically from Local Suspense into his stock unit. (This will then appear on the Branch
Trading Statement as Discrepancy OVER Resolved or as Discrepancy SHORT Resolved
for that stock unit).

If the Manager / Supervisor decides to investigate further he delays rollover until his
investigations are complete. He may decide to use other options on the Housekeeping menu
to process the suspense or he may decide that he wants to settle some local suspense via cash
payment and the remainder by some other option. Two new buttons “Gains from Local
Suspense” and “Losses from Local Suspense” will appear on the Housekeeping menu which
can be used by the Manager to clear amounts of local suspense for the whole branch: (these
will be done by clearing to cash). These buttons will return a screen similar to that in Figure
22 - Suspense Amount Entry screen to allow the amount to be entered.

If the Manager processes the Branch local suspense via the Housekeeping menu the clerk will
have to re-declare his cash before rolling over the stock unit.

When the clerk successfully logs into the current Horizon system the system first displays a

in the correct CAP. What happens next depends on which CAP the stock unit is currently
working:

= If the stock unit is working in the correct CAP the system displays the top level menu
= Ifthe stock unit is working in an old CAP the system returns a screen containing the
message “CAP Passed <Warning> The expected end date for the CAP that SU XXX is
currently working in (18) has passed. Please double check you are in the correct CAP
before starting work”.
= If the stock unit has rolled over early the system returns a screen containing the
message “CAP Early <Warning> The expected start date for the CAP that SU XXX is
currently working in (20) is in the future. Please double check you are in the correct
CAP before starting work”.
Either of the last 2 messages requires the clerk to touch the OK button before continuing: the
top level menu is then displayed. Similar messages will be provided for Impact Release 3
except that any references to “CAP” will be replaced by “TP”.

At Impact Release 3 some additional checks will be carried out before the top level menu is
displayed. This will be similar to the check implemented at end of day to protect against
unnecessary loss of data.

= The system will calculate the number of elapsed days since the stock unit rolled over
into its current Trading Period and if it is more than the “configurable parameter”
(probably 38) described in EA/DPR/004 - Impact Release 3 Design Proposal the
system will display a screen containing the message “Rollover Overdue <Warning> It
is 38 days since the stock unit was rolled over. Please roll it over as soon as possible
to avoid the risk of losing data”. (<Warning> appears in red on the screen). The clerk
has to acknowledge this message before he can continue

= The system will also calculate the number of elapsed days since the Branch rolled
over into its current Trading Period and if it is more than the “configurable parameter”
described in the Design Proposal the system will display a screen containing the
message “Rollover Overdue <Warning> It is 38 days since the office was rolled over.
Please roll it over as soon as possible to avoid the risk of losing data”. (<Warning>
appears in red on the screen). The clerk has to acknowledge this message before he
can continue.
