CASE POLTD/0809/0126

The above named Defendant appeared at Worcester Crown Court on 15 June 2009.

Following discussions between Counsel and consultation with this Office, the Defendant
pleaded guilty to Counts 4 and 5 of the Indictment on an agreed basis reflecting the full loss
of approximately £27,800.

A pre-sentence report was requested and the case was adjourned.
This matter is now listed on 3 August 2009 for sentence.

The case was adjourned to the above date to give the Defendant ample opportunity to sell
the post office and thereby repay the loss prior to sentence. The Sect 18 statement was not
signed or served at Court however, in the event the outstanding sum is not repaid,
confiscation proceedings will be considered at the next hearing.
