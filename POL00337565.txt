4.4 Overview of Document

This is a Quality Assurance Strategy document for POL. This document is to be used by POL
delivery teams, Partners, Suppliers, and stakeholders, as a guide of the quality assurance and
testing activities at POL.

It should be noted that Programme Test Strategies are to be delivered by Programmes of
work at POL and this this document sits at an organisational level and therefore covers how
QA is to be delivered at POL as a whole. It is envisaged that Programmes will dovetail their
Programme strategies in line with this document to ensure that robust testing has been
carried out

Testing efforts will be prioritised based on Horizon Change business priorities, which are
defined in the POL Demand Tracker, in addition to the functional and technical specifications.

This document is deemed to be a ‘living document’ that may be re-defined by the Head of
QA, as the POL test capability evolves and progresses. New versions of this document will be

tributed to all interested parties.

7 Post Office Test Approach

7.1 POL Test Centre of Excellence

A Testing Centre of Excellence (TCoE) is to be set up at POL. The TCoE capability is to be
developed by the TCoE Manager, alongside the Head of QA. The TCoE will function at the POL
organisational level. This will enable it to govern, measure and implement uniformity on POL
programmes. The TCoE will include the following goals:

Commitment to quality through t.

POL00337565

The illustration below conveys the remit of the TCoE and its level of test governance at the
organisational level. It should be noted that the said remit is only applicable at a

7.2 POL QA Governance Framework.

‘The POL QA Governance Framework is to be developed and implemented by the Head of QA
and POL TCoE Team, and.will be designed to function as an organisational level testing
approach, with a shift-left mentality. It will seek to work in a collaborative fashion with
supplier and internal development teams. The illustration below conveys the [ x ] steps that
are to be repeated throughout the processes, giving POL, a repeatable testing model. The
steps are to be implemented by the POL Test Management layer, with support from the POL
Test Leadership layers

{enter illustration here]

The aim of the POL QA Framework is to ensure swiftness, as well as nimbleness is possible,
whilst meeting the quality goals, driven by KPI's set out by the TCoE.

7.3. Testing Principals
The following test principles are to be adopted at POL:

sTesting is to be
considered early in the

development lifecycle

integrations are to be
considered when
impacting change environment

Note: These test principals are captured in the POL Test Policy please refer to the POL Test Policy document for
further de!

7.4 Testing Objectives at POL

The objectives of the POL Test Capability are to confirm the solution meets the signed-off
functional and non-functional»requirements, through verification, evidenced by test
reporting. Failure to meet said requirements are to be captured in the central Test repository
- Jira Software tool. The POL Test Capability are to address deviations from requirements, as
early as possible in the software development life cycle and help facilitate thought leadership,
to the resolution of said deviations. This is to include static testing of pre-signed off
requirements.

To meet these objectives, QA processes and activities will include:

«The POL Test Team being provided ample time to perform static testing and to feedback
on requirements

Determining and reporting the quality standards of the solution are being met by
implementing key quality gates throughout the delivery life cycle (including supplier
quality gates into POL)

* Providing support to the business/representative and end-user teams in validating that
the overall solution meets the described requirements, (both functionally and non-
functionally)

* Providing the business confidence through evidence-based metrics that the solution is fit
for purpose to move to the next quality gate and through to live. Where this is not the
case assist in mitigating the risk through issue management

* Supporting Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT) to make sure the exit criteria is met to
successfully support the live operation of a component and overall solution.

7.4.1 Service Virtualisation

In scenarios where a software dependency has been identified by the POL Test Team, the
objective of the team is to add this dependency to the POL Test Services RAID log and raise
this to the appropriate development team, as a requirement to add ‘Service virtualisation’ so
the dependency can be simulated. This will enable the team to provide testing services and
reports, in line with testing objectives prior to a solution being built.

For avoidance of doubt, this approach is deemed to be applicable at both an organisational
level and at a programme level. Service virtualisation at a programme level is considered a
service that is applicable to only the single programme. In this scenario, the internal
programme teams are to manage service virtualisation development. Where service
virtualisation is beneficial at a portfolio level (org level), the service is to be available to all
programmes for test purposes.

7.4.2 Automation Testing

To achieve the objectives above, an automated regression suite is to be created by the POL
Automation Test Team, that will enable all regression testing to run every time code is
released to an environment, whilst providing the POL Test Team with enough time to honour
the testing objectives outlined above. Both manual and automation test scripts are to be run
in environments, which are representative test environment and are as close as possible to
live.

Like service virtualisation, an automation framework is tobe developed at an organisational
level. At this level, the framework is considered an internal POL product that is useable by all
programmes. Just like a software. product, it will have its own source control and releases,
that will be distributed internally.

Scenarios where a standalone automation framework is to be created fora single programme,
is to be discussed and approved by the POL Automation Manager. It should be noted that not
everything is automatable, and) in some cases, automation candidates may be executed
better, as manual test cases due to complexities or other reasons.

The POL Automation Team are to set up a scoring system, in cases where this is questionable
and to display that the decision was metric driven, should there be an audit.

A QA Automation Approach document is to be created by the POL Automation Manager,
which will be a detailed extension of the POL QA Strategy.

7.4.3 Quality Standards and Goals
This section is intentionally left blank and will be worked on and populated with the TCoE
Manager.

7.4.4 Risk-Based Testing (RBT)

Risk Based Testing (RBT) is a method in software testing in which features, or discreet
components are prioritised by forming a Risk Rating against each feature or component. The
formula to calculate the risk, is as follows — should there be a failure, what is the:

Impact to business x Likelihood of failing = Risk Rating

The POL Test Team on any given programme of work, are in the first instance to focus testing
efforts on features and components that are deemed to be of high priority. This will start with
a review of the requirements for areas that are deemed high priority.

All risk analysis is to be added to a dedicated folder within a programmes folder structure, in
the POL SharePoint instance. This is to empower all resources that are tagged to working on
the programme to contest a risk rating for a given feature or component via a review process
that is to be set up by the testing authority on the said programme.

Test cases are to be development by the POL Test Team thereafter. The POL Test Team are to
develop in the first instance test cases for all high-priority features and components and then
medium and low-priority. Within priority ‘batch’ the test cases are to similarly be prioritised
and follow a high, medium, and low approach. The test cases are to be tagged with a priority
within the POL TestRail instance.

Per a functional area, the above distribution is expected, in which a small number of high-
priority test cases are developed, a high number of medium-priority test cases and finally a
small number of low-priority test cases are created, for execution purposes

9 Test Activities

The high-level phases illustrated below are applicable to both changes made to the solution
through the demand process, as well as other programmes of work within the Post Office.

9.1. Design phase

9.1.1 Programme Test Strategy

Where the POL Test Team are part of a programme, a Programme Test Strategy document is
to be produced, prior to development starting. The Programme Test Strategies at the Post
Office are to be templated and are not to deviate from. the QA Strategy (this document),
without approval from the Head of QA. All Programme Test Strategy documents, along with
the programme stakeholders are to be reviewed and signed-off by the Head of QA.

Where the POL Test Team are testing changes which are deemed to be BAU operational
demand, the QA Strategy (this document) is to be followed to ensure the correct quality gates
are met for change to be signed off by the POL Test Services Team.

9.1.2 Static Testing

9.1.2.1 Design Feedback

Testing is to start as early as the design phase. The POL Test Team are to work with the
Architect Team to review the design and potential weaknesses. Early feedback of the designs
is to be completed post-test review, through review meetings. The POL Test Team are to set
up meetings with the Architect, as part of the static testing process. The meetings are to help
identify and feedback on risks which are required to be discussed and potentially resolved
Following this approach will assist with the overall quality of design and requirements, which
delivery will rely on as a base for the construction of the solution.

In parallel, [POL Security Services] are to perform a review of the design from a security
perspective, to provide feedback on the design and mitigate security vulnerabilities caused
by design issues.

Performing static testing early in the development cycle, will enable a shift-left approach and
enables the Post Office to move from a defect detection to defect prevention approach.

POL00337565
POL00337565

9.1.2.2 Functional and Technical Review

Prior to requirements being sent to the business or a supplier to be signed-off, the POL Test
Team are provided ample time in which to perform a review of said requirements, whereby
the POL Test Team are to challenge and attempt to ‘break’ the requirements through static
testing. If discrepancies are found, these are to be listed and discussed with the [POL Design
Team].

The aim of this approach is to reduce misunderstandings of detailed requirements both
internally and externally (where Post Office suppliers are involved). Furthermore, this
approach will specifically highlight requirements that compel deeper specifications. The
outcome is to have the audience to have a clearer and concise requirement.

The review process is also considered a time for a POL Tester to understand what needs to be
tested and how the process and flow of the overall solution has the potential to break. The
review process, therefore, builds upon the creation of developing both manual test cases and
automation test scripts.

Under no circumstances are the POL Test Team to review or accept requirements for test
development which are in emails, instant messages or similar. Only requirements in the POL
Jira Software instance are applicable for test reviews and thereafter development activities.

9.1.2.3, Requirements Sign-Off

Prior to any development activities taking place, the requirements are to be reviewed and
signed off by the business, This will build upon an initial quality gate for both Post Office and
supplier development activities:

Under _no circumstances are the Post Office or Post Office suppliers to commence
development activities with requirements that are not signed-off.

9.1.3 Automation Framework Implementation
The goal of the POL Test Team is to adopt a shift-left approach to software testing. To support
this goal, the POL Automation Test Manager is to create and implement an automation testing
framework, A three-tier approach is to be taken to automation.

Tier 1: Automation of unit tests
© Tier 2: Automation of APIs (Application Programming Interface)
© Tier 3: Automation of Ul — E2E scenarios

Where automation is required on a programme outside of the two-tiers described above, the
approach to automation is to be guided by the programmes, Programme Test Strategy.

APOL automation approach is to be created by the POL Automation Test Manager, which will
be a detailed extension of the POL QA Strategy.

POL00337565
POL00337565

9.2 Development phase

9.2.1 Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development
Unit testing is a software development process that relies on the repetition of short
development cycles where a requirement is turned into a small, well defined and discreet
‘test’ script written in code. The software delivered is then developed to solve the discreet
‘test’ script written in code. Further test scripts and working software are added, until the
requirement is fully realised as a delivered feature.

This promotes a lean approach to development, specifically coding. Developers’at the Post
Office are to only write enough code to resolve the resolution of the unit test and to create a
function that helps that unit test to pass. As a result, the code is frequently smaller, more
efficient and of a better design and quality.

During a development phase, the Post Office Developer is to create a unit test for a discreet
function following the method described. A unit test is thereafter to be executed prior to the
code being committed to the source control and as part of the build process.

Scenarios where unit tests do not obtain a 100% pass rate, the Test-Driven Development
approach is to be followed to ensure that the failing test(s) are investigated. The diagram
below illustrates the approach in whith'tthis is to be accomplished.

9.2.1.1 Iterative Testing

Where agile delivery methodologies are implemented on programmes of work (such as
Scrum), during the development phase, the developer and testers are to work collaboratively
on the delivery of requirements. Tester(s) are to work on the creation of test scenarios, cases
and scripts, which will be executed once a ‘Task’ is in a ‘Ready for Testing’ status. It should be
noted that the accumulation of Tasks, would therefore make up a ‘Story’. Requirements are
to be gathered in the POL Jira Software instance.

During a Sprint, the POL Development Team will test at a Task and User Story level to verify
that the solution meets the acceptance criteria (and moves us closer to meeting the Definition
of Done (DoD)). A Product Owner (PO) is to validate the Story meets the requirements.

POL00337565
POL00337565

9.3 Testing phase

9.3.1 POL System Integration Testing

System Integration Testing (SIT) will start once the entry criteria into SIT is met. This will be
the first instance in which the solution will go through a formal entry criterion. Where
possible, the environment in which SIT is conducted is to point'to live or test integrations.
Where this is not possible, virtualised stubs are to be used.

The POL SIT phase will validate that the solution components and interfaces integrate with
other components correctly and support the fundamental end-to-end business processes.
The SIT phase is to be scenario based and event driven using a risk-based testing approach.
Where appropriate and to minimise risk, the POL Test Team are to test against non-human
created data i.e. machine-driven data, that is as close as possible to the expected live data.
This is particularly important for regression, testing activities, where consistency will be
paramount.

The approach to POL SIT will be to perform both positive and negative scenarios to observe
and report how the system behaves to happy paths and to errors and exceptions. The POL
Test Team are to develop POL SIT suite of test cases via the data journeys. These will be part
of an overall regression test suite and therefore scripts will be marked with a priority. All test
cases are to be held in the Gurock TestRail POL instance.

ASIT Test Plan.document will be created for each release. The SIT Test Plan will be a detailed
extension of a POL test strategy

9.3.2 POL System Acceptance Testing

System Acceptance Testing (SAT) will start once the entry criteria for SAT is met. Where
possible, the environment in which SAT is conducted is to point to live or test integrations.
Where this is not possible, virtualised stubs are to be used.

System Acceptance Testing is to consist of functional testing of the Core Business Application.
The aim of this approach is to assure the solution has been delivered to requirements and to
test with an aim to break the application. Scenarios identified where interfaces are required
but are directly not available to the POL Test Team will constitute as a candidate interface
that requires the development team to help mimic the flow of data, through a stub.

Although SAT will primarily be executed manually, the SAT regression suite is to be
automated. It should be noted, the second time a script is executed, it is considered a
regression test. To this end, the aim of the POL Automation Team will be to continuously

: 09-019: POL Test Strategy - Confidential
Copyright 2022 Post Office Limited
POL00337565
POL00337565

automate SAT scripts, so the POL Test Team are eventually able to focus on only manual SAT
execution for new changes. All test cases are to be held in the Gurock TestRail POL instance.

ASAT Test Plan document will be created for each release. The SAT Test Plan will be a detailed
extension of a POL test strategy

9.3.2.1 Smoke Test

During the creation of test cases, the POL Test Team are to identify and create a standalone
smoke test suite for the core business application. A smoke test is a technique to assess if a
build is in a ‘ready’ status for further testing. A smoke test is to test only critical paths and is
to be executed as soon as and every time new release is available to the POL Test Team.

Were smoke tests are automated, the scripts are to be tagged as “@smoke”. This is to enable
the identification and execution of automated scripts, as a standalone activity as and when
required by the business. Automated smoke tests are to be flexible enough for them to be
executed on multiple environments, as required (this includes environments.in which the
business and users will perform Business and User Acceptance Testing).

‘Smoke tests are to be executed every time a new build is deployed to an environment under
test, regardless of what phase in the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) or test phase. A
smoke test suite is therefore deemed universally applicable to all code releases of testing.

9.3.2.2 POL Regression Testing

Additional development or code enhancements to resolve defects create a likelihood of an
issue to occur in other areas of a Solution. To manage this risk, the Post Office are to periodical
execute regression tests,

A strategic approach is to be developed in'the identification of test cases, that are deemed to
be candidates for automation. A n-1 approach is to be taken i.e. test cases applicable for
automation from'the previous releases will be automated. This strategic approach will enable
an entire automation suite to be executed frequently (and save on execution costs). In turn,
this will provide the benefit of enabling the POL Test Team to focus efforts on only new change
and perform exploratory testing.

Where automation testing is not possible and the test cases are deemed to be of high priority,
the POL test team are to execute these test cases manually, as a regression cycle. The POL
Manual and Automation Team will tactically work together to ensure duplication is not taking
place.

The POL Automation Test Team are to communicate the results of an automated regression
run to the POL Manual Test Team. All failures in the automated regression run are to be
verified manually by the POL Manual Test Team. If a failure is valid a bug is to be raised by the
POL Manual Test Team. If the failure is not valid, the POL Manual Test Team are to
communicate this to the POL Automation Test Team for investigation and maintenance.

9.3.2.3 Exploratory Testing

Each time a test script is executed, its probability of finding a defect over time deteriorates.
However, consistency is required to ensure that the solution has not regressed, a level of
randomness will equally prove useful when testing. The POL Test Team are therefore to

perform exploratory testing to compliment the (automated) regression testing cycle but
without the constraints of a test case.

Value per a test
script

The ‘exploratory tester’ is to use the Jira Software tool to create a task issue type, which is
labelled as ‘exploratory’. The task is to outline the area of testing and the time constraint set
against the task. The tester is to then exploré/and test the ‘fenced! areas of the system to find
defects. All findings and recommendations are to be added to Jira Software, defects are to be
linked back to the task issue type and in cases where defects have been found, a test case is
to be created.

9.4 Quality Assurance Phase

9.4.1 Non-functional Testing

Non-functional Testing (NFT) will start once the entry criteria for the applicable NFT type of
testing is met. The NFT test phase verifies that non-functional features have been developed
to perform as described by the NFT requirements and design specifications. Testing is to
include validation activities of the procedures, operational processes and applications.

Three types of Non-functional testing are applicable at the Post Office:

* Performance Testing
© Security Testing
© Operational Acceptance Testing

9.4.1.1 Performance Testing

Performance testing is to be performed on a dedicated NFT environment that is
representative of the production environment. This is so the dedicated NFT environment is
subject to a representative load to validate the performance of the applications. Distinct types
of loads are to be applied to verify scenarios, which will include spikes and gradual increases
in load caused by more traffic over time.

Although it may be deemed less of an importance to perform performance testing on
solutions hosted ifi the cloud, the applications themselves that are hosted in the cloud remain
candidates for performance optimisation activities.

Performance testing activities are to start early, in which the Performance Test Manager will
conduct an initial evaluation to understand the NFR (Non-Functional Requirements)
requirements or to put forward NFR requirements, as part of the demand process, to help
guide change requests further with Non-functional Requirement (NFR) considerations.
Detailed test scenarios and test data models are to be created during the design phase as
preparation to assure maximum system and application coverage is achieved by the Post
Office.

A Performance Testing Approach document is to_be created by the Performance Test
Manager, which will be a detailed extension of the POL QA Strategy.

9.4.1.2. Security Testing

9.4.1.3 Operational Acceptance Testing

OAT is to validate that the applications and business operational processes, process and
operational readiness of the solution. OAT is to be executed mostly independently of other
test phases, although overlaps with penetration and performance testing are likely to occur.

OAT is to be managed by POL Services Team with support from the Head of Testing and QA.
The POL Services Team will plan and execute OAT, ensuring it has alignment and minimal
impact with test delivery activities, whilst maintaining the full, planned OAT test coverage.

Where applicable, suppliers will be responsible for supporting the POL Services Team in test
planning, environmental set-up, and test execution activities, which will include but are not
limited to defect diagnosis and change management. The POL Services Team, along with the
Head of Test and QA are to arrange and manage conversations with the suppliers.

Where OAT test activities are applicable for a release, an OAT Test Plan document is to be
created. The OAT Test Plan will be a detailed extension of the POL QA Strategy (org level)

9.4.2 POL Business Acceptance Testing

Business Acceptance Testing (BAT) will start once the entry criteria into BAT is met. The BAT
phase will validate that the agreed requirements have been met. POL Business Managers are
to performs checks on core business processes & flows, as well as ensure POL meets (where
applicable) its compliance and legislative requirements.

Business test scenarios are to be created by the POL Business Managers. Scenarios which are
to be executed to verify business processes and flows are to be behaviour driven and are to
correlate and with different end-user personas. Scenarios which are compliance or legislative,
are to be validated by executing a separate test suite, named “Compliance”. This approach
will enable the test suites to be exectited and reported independently of one another.

Although the POL Test Team will not execute BAT test scenarios, testing support will be
provided for test management tools, defect triage meetings and exit / entry criteria evidence
required by the Business Managers. All test cases are to be held in the Gurock TestRail POL
instance. All BAT bugs are to be tagged with BAT in the Jira Software tool and are to be
traceable back to the requirements.

ABAT Test Plan document will be created for each release. The BAT Test Plan will be a detailed
extension of a POL test strategy

POL00337565

9.4.3 User Acceptance Testing

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) will start once the entry criteria into UAT is met. The UAT
phase will validate that the agreed requirements fit the needs of the end-users, when the
solution is integrated with all interfaces, both internally and externally.

Identification of persona-driven test scenarios are to be created by the business managers
and end-users as a collaborative effort. The POL Test Team are to support this activity through
training of testing best standards, test tooling and bug reporting.

AIl UAT bugs are to be tagged with UAT in the Jira Software tool and are to be traceable back
to the requirements.

A UAT Test Plan document will be created for each release. The UAT Test Plan will be a
detailed extension of a POL test strategy

9.4.3.1 UAT in Model Office vs Non-Model Office

The Model Office is the first instance in which people, process and technology come together
in a staged setting. The technology at this point will have gone through several testing and
quality cycles to ensure that the end-users are testing against proven technology. Therefore,
the aim of UAT in the model office will be to ensure that processes outside of the technology
are efficiently workable with the technology, by end-users.

To this end, UAT is to be executed by end-users, with the Support of both the POL Test Team
and POL Business Managers. At the Post Office UAT will have two approaches (1) UAT (non-
model office) and (2) UAT (model office). Where, major changes are required to be tested
UAT is to be conducted in a Model Office setting to bring together the people, process and
technology.

Where minor changes are made to the baselined core business application through reference
data changes, then UAT can be conducted virtually. All test cases are to be held in the Gurock

9.5 Live phase

Testing activities are not applicable in the live phase; however, the)POL Test Team can
perform non-intrusive checks of the application, in live.

9.5.1 Problems and Incidents in Live

Once a release is in live, issues are no longer to be referred to as defects but instead incidents.
These incidents are to be identified, logged in the ServiceNow application and prioritised by
a business representative.

The POL Service Test Team are to investigate the issue and provide their input. Where
applicable, a test case is to be created. As part of the investigation, the POL Service Test Team
are to refer to the original requirements and put forward a case of it being a Change Request
(CR) where the requirement is fully met. This is to follow the demand process.

Scenarios where the requirement is not fully met, will require the incident to be recorded in
the Jira Software tool and prioritised in correlation with the business priority. This incident is
to be tracked to resolution, by the POL Service Test team, including a retest of the resolution,
to provide the business confidence it can be deployed to live.

Problems are considered the root cause of many incidents. In other words, multiple incidents
have the same pointer or symptom. The same process described above applies for problems.

Further to the suspension of testing, testing will be resumed when the above conditions have
been resolved. Where the suspension criteria are required to be exercised, the test authority
‘on a programme is to seek execute the suspension of testing. Test suspension is to be
comprehensively communicated by the test authority, to the business stakeholders (including
the Head of QA) with evidence.

11.4.1 Test Resumption Criteria
Where the test authority has decided to suspend testing, the criteria for resuming testing is
outlined, as follows:

* Areasonable caveat is in place to enable testing to continue. The risk has been mitigated
or resolved

‘Anew code release is made available for testing

Environmental issues have been addressed and resolved

12 Scope of Testing

The scope of testing is to be determined at a programme level. However, per the principals
of testing, found in the POL Test Policy ‘all changes are to be tested’. This will include the any
changes that are part of the current ‘three routes to live’:

12.1 Out of Scope for POL Test Team
The following areas of testing are out of scope for the POL Test Team:

* Where new compliance is introduced, it is the responsibility of the POL business
representative to author and maintain compliance related test scripts and to execute
them in the first instance. As there is currently not a POL compliance test suite at POL, it
is to be created by the POL Business Managers. Test scripts are to be uploaded to the POL
TestRail instance and are to be executed from this instance, thereafter.

* Where new legislation by Government.is introduced, it will be the responsibility of the
POL business representative to author and execute the test cases in the first instance. This
is to assure legislation has been met and can be evidenced by the business. As there is
currently not a POL legislation test suite, it will need to be created by the POL Business
Managers. Test scripts are to be uploaded to the POL TestRail instance and are to be
executed from this instance, thereafter.

In both cases above, test cases will automatically deemed as high priority. Test cases,
wherever possible are therefore to be automated for regression testing purposes. Any test
cases that are not automatable are to be executed manually during the POL BAT phase.

Further to the above, where change has not been agreed with the Head of IT Enterprise
Demand Management via the Demand process, testing will be considered out of scope for
the POL Test Team.

Where an impact assessment (IA) is conducted by the POL Test Team and a feature is
untestable, the POL Test Team are to articulate this during the IA phase. Once agreed, these
items will be considered out of scope for testing purposes. Lastly, all standalone out of the
box (OTB) software and hardware is considered out of scope of testing, for example anti-virus
software or barcode reader.

13 Defect Management

This section of the document will cover the pre-production defect management process that
is to be followed within the Horizon Improvements Programme. Post-live, the process is to
follow the incident management process, which is governed by the POL Services.

For avoidance of doubt, defects are to be managed through Jira Software and Incidents are
to be managed through ServiceNow.

At the time of writing this document, an integration between Jira Software and ServiceNow is
being explored to help harmonise the information flow between the two platforms and to
make sure information on incidents is synchronised.

At POL, a defect is to be defined as a state in which the software developed during SDLC, does
not meet a requirement or as per POL business or end-user expectation which is non-
functional but can be considered a reasonable cosmetic change, with minimumimpact to the
underlying solution. A defect is therefore an error in the coding or logic of said solution, which
will cause the software to malfunction or produce incorrect/unexpected results.

13.1 Defect Classification

POL will delivery operations are to apply on the agreed definition of severity and priority,
which are described below. Defects are to be assigned a severity by the reporter of the defect.
A priority is to be assigned to a defect only during a Defect Triage Meeting (DTM) bya business
representative. Dependent on the stage of testing, the business representative can be
considered (1) a Product Owner (2) Business Manager (3) end-user (via Business Managers).

Defects are to be initially fixed based on severity ratings. Whilst assigning of a priority remains
important, the process calls for firstly focusing on technical factors that help the system reach
a level of stability, prior to priority being set on outstanding defects. This enables the delivery
to ensure that the Solutions core functionality is working prior to business validation or
‘showcasing’.

13.1.1 Severity Definitions

At POL, the defect severity represents the technical product impact, or in other words how
badly is the technical solution broken. To enable this to be communicated clearly for triage,
the following severity levels and definitions are applicable, at POL.

13.1.2 Priority Definitions

At POL, the defect priority represents the impact to the business. Priority can be assigned as
early as the POL testing phase, but only by Product Owners, Business Managers, or end-users
(via Business Managers).

To enable this to be communicated clearly for triage, the following priority levels and
definitions are applicable, at POL.

On a given programme or project, the Development Lead is responsible for assigning the
defects to a developer for further investigation and resolution (where a defect has been
raised during BAT:/,UAT, the POL test team are responsible for validating the defect, prior to
it being assigned to the Development Lead.

The following should be noted during a quality gate (including within test phase exits):

* The POL Test Team accept zero Blocker or Critical severity defects
* The POL Test Team accept zero Urgent or High priority defects

In exceptional circumstances, where the above statements are not met, the POL Test Team
are to articulate the findings via a report. The report is to highlight mitigations for each issue,
where applicable. The report is to be sent to [role/department] to determine if the risks are
acceptable to proceed to the next stage.

POL00337565
POL00337565

13.2 Defect Process
The processes for Test Incident Management are not to vary across the programmes, test
phases and quality gates. The processes are to have the following cohesions:

* A defect manager is to review outstanding defects and incidents to ensure that a
resolution plan is firmly in place and that this plan is tracked and outcomes are reported
to relevant stakeholders

* All defects are required to be logged against a requirement. Else, they are to be
considered candidates for the change request processes

© Adaily defect triage meeting (DTM) is to be conducted as soon as a phase of testing starts.
The Defect Triage Team are to ensure defects are classified correctly (per the definitions
outlined in the ‘Defect Classifications’ section). Priority is to be set only by the business or
end-users at the appropriate time. This is outlined in the Defect Triage Meeting document.

© The detail of a single issue is to be recorded and tracked in a centralised repository, so
there isa single source of truth and to enable quicker triaging and resolution. Defects are
to have traceability to a design requirement, a build or other test artefacts that are
relevant to the defect and resolution.

© Defects are to be logged by the person that has discovered the defect in the POL Jira
Software instance, following the standardised approach to defect creation. Please refer
to the POL Defect Standardisation approach.

13.2.1 Defect Triage Meeting (DTM)

In line with the POL Test Capability objectives, the POL Test Managers are to ensure that
defects are reviewed, resolved and retested swiftly. In recognition of this, the POL Test
Managers are to review the Severity and priority of defects, with the Defect Triage Team
{0TT).

‘A Defect Triage Meeting (DTM) is to be setup by the POL Test Managers and is to invite
business, project management, development and test representation. In this meeting
participants are to go, through bugs in severity order (pre-POL BAT and UAT) and then in
priority order (during POL BAT and UAT).

The following format therefore applies:

* Review all newly raised defects in the past 24 hours
Confirm the severity and priority ratings are correct (dependent on phase)
Review all Blocker and Critical defects and confirm an estimated fix time

The meeting is to take place daily for 20 minutes and is deemed standard practice for all POL
programmes of work, regardless of delivery methodology. The aim of this meeting is to
provide 24-hour windows in which defects are reviewed and updated on consistently.

POL staff are encouraged to read D: 09-028 - Defect Triage Meetings, to understand how the
DTM process and resolution sequences are to be implemented as standard practice on
programmes.

14 Test Data

14.1 Pre-test execution

Pre-POL test execution on an environment, the requirement to identify appropriate test data
for test execution will be deemed a compulsory activity by the team performing the test
execution. Data is to be made available to the test execution team, at least 7 days prior to the
planned test execution activities starting, per the test plan and test entry criteria.

14.2 Obtaining Test Data
The types of data required to support the testing of each deliverable at both a programme
level and organisational level and how it is to be generated, is required to be agreed at an
organisational level for the core regression testing suite and at a programme level, per a test
phase fora given release.

The following stages are to be considered when discussing the generation of test data:

‘Establish the scope of the inputs and outputs that

The Solution Validation and Integration
environment has been specifically tailored /
designed to support functional testing to
validate customer business requirements for
project related change. It is representative of
LIVE in that it has many of the capabilities
that operate in the LIVE environment: “Real”
Counter and peripheral hardware supplied
and managed by Computacenter, with
Verizon managed Branch networking
integrated with a fully managed Data Centre
and real interfaces to third parties — albeit
with test end points. It is used by many user
groups and is seen as the “busiest” of test
environments servicing multiple requests on
a regular basis.

The Live System Test environment isin place
to support the LIVE environment, focussing
on the patching and maintenance of the
individual components that make up the
Horizon solution. For Project change, LST is
used primarily to rehearse the
deployment/migration activities with

the same tooling/teams and process that
would be used for LIVE. However, the POL
Test Team believe this is not only limited to
the said activities but also to some further
changes and testing from a partner
perspective.

RDT is not a full-blown replication of the
production Horizon environment. It only has
elements required to support operation of
branch counters, and the delivery of
reference data to said counters. This means it
has several counters (spread across Fujitsu
Bracknell, Future Walk, Finsbury Dials, and
some home locations). Within the Horizon
data centre, it has a BAL (Branch Access
Layer) server, connecting to the BRDB
(Branch Database), connections to RDMC

19 POL Test Reporting

This section of the POL QA Strategy will outline the reports that are to be generated by the
POL Test Team at all stages of the System Development Lifecycle and Release Lifecycle.
Reporting is an important aspect of testing, as it will enable the POL Test Team to
communicate testing outcomes to relevant stakeholders and therefore afford constructive
discussions and metric-driven decision making. All reporting is considered a snapshot and any
changes made to the solution are therefore subject to further testing.

At a programme level, reports will be added to the relevant folder structure within the
programme itself. At an organisational level, particularly when the core regression suite is
executed reporting is to be stored in a dedicated location on SharePoint.
