Document Summary

This is a working document, which will be reviewed once a year for relevance. It
may also be reviewed at other intervals when a significant change in the working
environment or relevant working activities takes place.

The document is issued to all RMG Security Teams. It is strictly confidential, and

access is restricted to the RMG Security Team network only, via the appropriate

channels.

Purpose

The aim of this document is to explain the processes Royal Mail Group (RMG)
Security personnel need to follow in order to access both forensic and technical
services. To avoid confusion all investigatory persons within RMG are referred to
throughout this document as the ‘Officer In the Case’, or OIC. This includes
anyone in RMG who conducts PACE interviews, including investigators in Royal Mail
Letters, Post Office Ltd. (POL), and Parcelforce Worldwide (PFWW).

Forensic services are normally accessed to determine the significance of evidence
recovered, particularly in cases that are thought to present a high risk of challenge
in court. There are a variety of forensic tests, but the majority of RMG forensic
examination is in the comparison of fingerprints and the comparison of handwriting
samples.

Technical services may be defined as the accessing of particular equipment to
support an investigation. This might be technical equipment deployed at the start of
an investigation to help gain evidence, to the tape machines used to record an
interview, or the examination of digital equipment during an investigation, right up to
the copying of CCTV images in order that evidence may be placed before a court.

Introduction

Forensic and technical services are split in two in this document, to aid clarity.
However, both services are intended to support the RMG Policy of prosecuting
dishonest employees or their agents, and also on occasion members of the public
who perpetrate crimes against the Royal Mail Group.

Currently RMG purchases forensic support from a ‘one stop shop’, the Forensic
Science Service (FSS). Therefore any reference to suppliers of forensic services in
this document will deemed to be FSS, albeit the contract may alter, and on rare
occasions the FSS may sub-contract work to other suppliers. Most forensic experts
charge between £70 and £120 an hour for their expertise. The most common RMG
cases referred to the FSS include fingerprint identification and handwriting
comparisons. Analysis of samples of these may result in costs of between a few
hundred pounds to several thousand pounds per case, depending on the complexity

and quality of evidence submitted.

Technical support is rendered by a variety of people, but all the services may be
accessed via the Security System Support Manager (SSSM) in Royal Mail. If any
doubt exists about any part of the technical process please contact the SSSM for
advice. Details are included in the contact section at the end of this document.

Forensic Procedure

The Forensic Science Service (FSS) consists of privatised former police forensic
laboratories. Currently there are six FSS laboratories in the UK, with the Head
Office being in Birmingham. The FSS provide over 25 separate services to their
customers including the following main type of forensic analysis:

i) Fingerprint examination and comparison
ii) Handwriting examination and comparison
iii) Indented handwriting examination (ESDA) and comparison

iv) Date-stamp or print examination and comparison
v) Ink examination and comparison
vi) DNA analysis, profiling and matching

Note: Royal Mail Letters currently provide services relating to the copying of CCTV
footage and images. In these cases advice should NOT be sought from the FSS, but
referred to the Royal Mail Security Systems Support Manager (SSSM). Royal Mail
Letters also provides services relating to the examination of digital media, such as
computer hard drives and mobile phones. In these cases advice should NOT be sought
from the FSS, but referred to the Computer Forensic Team, as detailed in the contacts
section at the end of this document.

Any Officer in a case (OIC) should check with their Line Manager prior to
submitting any evidence for forensic examination. The eventual decision must be
approved by a Territorial Investigation Manager, or equivalent. This is in order to
ensure costs are not incurred unnecessarily. It has been the case that forensic
tests have been conducted that have resulted in costs of several thousand pounds
to RMG, yet upon being interviewed, or re-interviewed, the suspect has admitted
the offence without even being shown or told about the forensic evidence. As
always, efforts should be made to keep expenditure to a minimum.

Clearly, it is impossible to judge precisely when to seek forensic assistance, as
cases will vary, and people may change their plea at court, but generally it is

POL00104813

POL00104813

expected evidence should be put to most suspects before forensic tests are run, in

case they admit the offence, and obviate the need for forensic tests. However, in

very serious prosecutions, or cases where the forensic evidence may be thought to

degenerate significantly, it may be considered prudent to get the forensic analysis
completed straight away. In these cases the OIC should immediately consult and
seek guidance from their Line Manager before any submission is made.

In order to elicit the support of the FSS the following process should be followed:

1)

2)

3)

4)

5)

6)

7)

8)

The OIC should establish with their Line Manager the need for
forensic examination to be conducted.

Having got agreement from a Territorial Investigation Manager (or
equivalent) via the Line Manager, the OIC should phone the FSS
using the phone number listed on the forensic submission form
GS302, and explain the nature of the work to be undertaken. The
FSS will take these details, and duly supply a rough quote and a
rough timescale to complete the work - by definition these may vary
when the FSS actually see the work.

The cost and timescales should be communicated by the OIC to their
Line Manager. If agreed by the Territorial Investigation Manager or
equivalent the OIC should again contact the FSS by phone. They will
be instructed where to submit the work, and how.

Once the FSS have given the instructions the OIC should complete
the GS302 submission form and arrange for this form and the work
to be delivered as instructed to the appropriate laboratory. There is a
Purchase Order reference number on the Group Security website
immediately before accessing the GS302 form. This reference is
applicable to all cases submitted by Royal Mail Letters and
Parcelforce, and must be quoted in the relevant section on the
GS302, prior to posting. POL will need to contact their Casework
Team for the appropriate Purchase Order number.

Warning: On no account should crucial evidence be posted in the ordinary
mail - Special Delivery may be used if no suitable alternatives exist.
Once evidence is submitted the FSS will conduct the checks, and
contact the OIC with the results. If subsequently required they will
provide statements, and may attend court. They charge separately for
these services. The FSS will send the appropriate invoice to the RMG
accounts team in Chesterfield for payment.

lf any problems are experienced or any concerns arise with the
service provided by the FSS the OIC should contact the Royal Mail
SSSM, and make them aware of these issues. The SSSM will feed
back concerns to the FSS, for them to address.

Additionally, if the FSS have any concerns or issues with work

submitted they may contact the SSSM and make them aware of
these, in order remedial action can be taken, where appropriate.

POL00104813

Various technical procedures exist. The Royal Mail Security Systems Support
Manager (SSSM) can explain these, if required. The main procedures are as
follows:

1) The repair of PACE interview tape machines, or similar equipment (form GS304)

The Neal twin or three deck tape recorders are supplied and repaired by David
Horn Communications. The company details, including the address and contact
phone number, are listed on form GS304. They should be contacted for details on
costs, and timescales. The cost for the supply and repair of such equipment is
now borne by each separate Business Unit. Before any expenditure is undertaken it
should be agreed with your Line Manager and the relevant budget holder. Repairs
to additional equipment should be as normal for office equipment, either repaired by
the relevant supplier, or disposed of, as deemed appropriate.

2) The copying of CCTV or similar evidence (form GS307)

Royal Mail Letters retains the capability to copy CDs, DVDs, VHS tapes and
various forms of DVR hard drives, particularly for subsequent use in court cases.
Business Units can currently access this service for free. Advice may be sought
from the Royal Mail Security Systems Support Manager (SSSM) as per the
contact details at the end of this document. Prior to completing form GS307 the
OIC should contact the SSSM and seek advice. If the work can be undertaken the
OIC should complete the GS307 work form and forward it with the work to be
undertaken to the SSSM. Timescales will vary according to the work requested and
annual leave commitments, but routinely will normally involve a turnaround of just a
couple of days.

3) Examination of computer equipment and digital devices (form GS308)

Royal Mail Letters retains the capability to forensically examine digital devices, such
as computer equipment and the like, particularly for subsequent use in court cases.
Business Units can currently access this service for free. An on-line form exists in
the Group Security Database, form GS308. Additionally, advice may be sought from
the Computer Forensic Team. Their contact details are at the end of this
document.

4) The supply and removal of covert CCTV camera equipment (forms GS305 and GS306
respectively)

A separate policy exists for the covert CCTV camera process, and may be found
on the intranet. If advice is required please contact the Royal Mail SSSM using the
details on the contact sheet at the end of this document.

5) Miscellaneous services, including the replenishment of forensic consumables
Advice should be sought from the Royal Mail SSSM. Contact details are associated
at the end of this document.
