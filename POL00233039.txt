Horizon Error

Thanks you for hanging up on me simply because you cannot answer a simple

question !

Once AGAIN Horizon on Line is producing ANOTHER error.

This time in the printing of Special Delivery before 9 labels !

How you must all enjoy praising this infallable system...

Perhaps you might actually acknowledge this latest failure and put it in writing via

Memoview.

Oh silly me Post Office Ltd computer system never had faults. Dying laughing.
