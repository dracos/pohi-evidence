Agreement
Version: 2.0

1.0 Introduction

The purpose of this process agreement is to formally document the objectives and responsibilities
which each unit involved in the support of the Horizon solution has towards the other units
similarly involved.

This process agreement specifically excludes the management of Operational problems for which
CORE SERVICES is wholly responsible, and all hardware related calls.

This process agreement also documents the measures by which each unit will be measured in its
performance of those objectives and responsibilities.

This document does not attempt to define the processes by which each unit will function, since
these are documented elsewhere, although it does outline briefly parts of those processes where
they relate specifically to the obligations between the units.

The document is laid out in the form of specific obligations between each level of support, and
the other level (s) of support to which it relates, with specific measures in bold italics after each
obligation.

Note that support for the Pathway system is required 24hrs * 365 days per year and therefore
there is likely to be a requirement for some or all lines of support to provide the service on this
basis.

2.0 Scope

The scope of this document is limited to the units responsible for the support of the software in
the Pathway Solution

3.0 HSH/HIT/SMC obligations to SSC

a

b

c

d

e

From the point of view of the SSC, the HSH, SMC and HIT units can be treated as one “unit”
since incidents reported to the SSC should always have been passed from the HSH to the HIT
prior to being received. Only the HIT and the SMC has a direct interface to the SSC. Each unit
has separate responsibilities, however for the purpose of this document and interface agreement
the SMC will act as a_ single point of contact for all units and report accordingly to the SSC
Whilst 100% conformance is generally expected and strived for in all areas a 5% deficit ( i.e.
95%conformance) in the overall performance on a rolling three month basis is accepted by all
parties.

The functions of this unit are -

To receive calls from the customer, whether this be Postmasters, APS Clients,TIP, Pathway
internal staff etc. This includes raising calls as a result of events monitored from the live system.

To log all calls on a call management system (currently Powerhelp)

No justified complaints from customers regarding calls not being logged.

To “filter” all hardware calls and route them to the appropriate unit for hardware support

No hardware calls passed to SSC except in circumstances where Fujitsu services Pathway
need to be made aware, e.g. recurrent hardware problems which need to be addressed between
Fujitsu services Pathway and a supplier.

To “filter” all calls for which the problem is already known to the support community and for
which a resolution is already known or has been generated. In this context the term “resolution”
can take a number of forms, including

i) The statement that the problem is resolved in release xxx of the Horizon solution
ii) There is a documented workround for the problem.

iii) IThe documentation relating to that part of the system is under review or being
changed.

No calls passed to the SSC which are subsequently resolved as known errors, except in cases
where the symptoms reported by the customer did not match the symptoms recorded in the
known error documentation, and which therefore the HSH/HIT/SMC could not reasonably
have been expected to find.

To retain in the Powerhelp systems duplicate incidents - i.e. incidents which are repetitions of an
incident which has already been passed to the SSC, and to ensure that when the resolved incident
is received from the SSC, the duplicated calls are closed.

Agreement
Version: 2.0

Company in Confidence Date: 17-Jun-2003

No duplicated incidents passed to the SSC, except in cases where the symptoms reported by
the customer did not match the symptoms recorded in the original incident, and which
therefore the HSH/HIT/SMC could not reasonably have been expected know as a duplicate .

f) To ensure that the correct evidence for any problem is collected prior to the incident being
passed to the SSC for investigation.

No calls rejected by the SSC on the basis that the evidence was inadequate. Specifically
excluded from this measure are instances where, although the evidence was inadequate, the
SSC had not documented the evidence required and occasions where the evidence required
was unobtainable,

g) To ensure that any incident which requires investigation by the SSC is passed onto the call
management system used by Fujitsu Services Pathway (currently PinICL) assigned to the correct
SSC team (EDSC).

No calls lost because of incorrect assignment by HSH/HIT/SMC

h) To ensure that if there are any updates made to incidents passed to the SSC which will assist the
SSC in diagnosis, then these are sent to the SSC in the same manner as g).

No justified complaints from SSC staff regarding updated calls not being received by the
SSC.

i) To ensure that any calls passed to the SSC are passed in a timely manner. The exact timings will
be defined in the final version of this document. The timings will be a vary according to the
total time allowed for resolution of the problem in the contract between Fujitsu Services Pathway
and the customer. These timings will therefore be dependant on the priority of the incident, with
less time will be allowed for an “A” priority call than will be permitted for (for example) a “C”
priority.

Specific targets for timescales are documented in appendix B of this document.

j) To ensure that the priority of any incident is assessed and recorded correctly.

No calls passed to the SSC whose priority does not conform to the specification defined in
appendix A
k) To ensure that reports are available to the SSC concerning —

number of calls received
number of calls passed to SSC by priority
time taken between receipt of the call and transfer to SSC by priority

time between receipt of the call by SSC and the resolution passed back to HSH/HIT/SMC by
priority.
No justified complaints from SSC management concerning inadequacies of call handling
statistics

1) Review SSC reports of incorrectly diagnosed calls. Agree and arrange regular reviews of this
OLA and the achievements based on the reports

No justified complaints from SSC management concerning inadequacies of call management
reviews.

m) To “filter” all user error calls and ensure that they are closed

No calls passed to SSC which are subsequently closed as “user error”

n)_ To “filter” all advice and guidance calls and ensure that they are closed

No calls passed to SSC which are subsequently closed as “advice and guidance”

0

To “filter” all calls for which the Pathway software in not at fault.

No calls passed to SSC which are subsequently closed as “No fault in product”

p) To monitor events effectively on the live estate

No “red” events on the live system to go unnoticed, with appropriate action taken for each
one. In this context, a “red” event is one which is logged as critical, and appears in red on the
Tivoli screens and with a red marker in NT event logs

To take corrective action for all red events

q

HSH/HIT/SMC to check for the event in the event list for the relevant system subsection
(which is held on the SSC web site) and to take the documented action. No event calls passed
to the SSC without this documentation having been consulted.

New call to be raised for each red event that is not already known on the “known errors “
database, and passed to the SSC for action, with a skeleton KEL.

r

To ensure that event-related issues have been correctly documented

No calls passed to the SSC for event-related issues without a KEL having been created to
document the symptoms.

s

To ensure that “event storms” are correctly handled

Where an event storm is being produced by a server, or by a subsystem in the Pathway
solution, AND where the cause of that event has already been documented, then
HSH/HIT/SMC should ,where possible, take appropriate action to prevent the system
becoming “swamped” with repeat events. No complaints from customer or from other
supporting units concerning system performance or support issues caused by inadequately
handled event storms.

&

hb

To ensure that any incidents so received are maintained on the call management system used by
Fujitsu Services Pathway (PinICL). Where updates are made to the calls which are of relevance
to the HSH/HIT/SMC, then the SSC will ensure that these updates reach the Powerhelp system.

To ensure that the incident reported is correctly resolved and the resolution recorded on the
PinICL system and the incident and resolution passed back to the HSH/HIT/SMC call
management system (Powerhelp). The resolution should include a full explanation of the
problem and the action taken to resolve it, be this a workround or a code change, or other action.

No justified complaints regarding incorrect diagnosis of problems from HSH/HIT/SMC

No complaints regarding calls closed on PinICL not subsequently transferred back to
Powerhelp.

To ensure that the incident is resolved within the total time allowed by the contract between the
customer and Fujitsu Services Pathway.

No justified complaints from the CORE SERVICES regarding late resolution of problems, no
invocation of penalty clauses by the customer because of slow resolution of incidents.

To ensure that the HSH/HIT/SMC is made aware of the evidence requirements for any form of
incident and that this documentation is fully maintained.

No complaints from the HSH/HIT/SMC that they did not know the evidence required to be
collected for any call. A specific exception to this would be the situation in which a completely
new type of call was received, causing the SSC to update the relevant documentation.

To create and maintain a register of known deficiencies with the Pathway solution, and the
resolution for these problems (where known), and to allow access to this register to
HSH/HIT/SMC so that they can fulfil the function of filtering known errors.

“known error” system to be maintained, up to date with the current SSC knowledge. System to
be available at all times, except when backup is in progress.

To ensure that any resolutions or workrounds that are passed to the SMC have been tested and
have been correctly authorised via the Release Authorisation process.

No untested workrounds or resolutions to be passed from SSC to HSH/HIT/SMC.

The exception to this rule would be the case where resolutions are being passed to the SMC
specifically to be downloaded to the Pathway rigs for testing prior to general release.

To ensure that the HSH/HIT/SMC is supplied with documentation relating to new releases of the
Pathway solution in sufficient time to enable HSH/HIT/SMC staff to become familiar with the
product prior to its release.

product release.

i) To ensure that for any incident which has been resolved and passed back to the Powerhelp system,
the customer has been contacted and made aware of the closure.

No complaints from HSH/HIT/SMC to SSC regarding failure to ensure customer agreement
with the closure of an incident.

j) To hold workshops and skills transfer sessions relating to technical aspects of the Pathway
solution and diagnostic techniques.

No justified complaints from HSH/HIT/SMC with regard to lack of technical training where
this training could have been supplied by the SSC.

k) To ensure that the following figures are available to the HSH/HIT/SMC on demand.
i) Number of calls currently outstanding at the SSC by priority
ii) Number of calls where resolution has been deferred to the next release
iii) Number of calls against age in the SSC or 4" line support units.

iv) Number of calls including PINICL reference numbers for calls perceived to have been
erroneously passed to SSC

No justified complaints from HSH/HIT/SMC management concerning inadequacies of call
handling statistics

5.0 SSC Obligations to 4" line support

a) To ensure that all calls passed to 4" line are logged on a call management system (currently
PinICL)

b) To “filter” all calls for which the problem is already known to the support community and for
which a resolution is already known or has been generated. This includes problems for which a
resolution is known to the SSC but not yet incorporated into the known deficiencies register
available to HSH/HIT/SMC.

No calls passed to 4" line support which are subsequently identified as known errors, except
in cases where the resolution was known to 4" line, but this information had not been passed
to the SSC.

c) To retain in the PinICL system, under the SSC “stack” duplicate incidents - i.e. incidents which
are repetitions of an incident which has already been passed to the 4" line support, and to ensure
that when the resolved incident is received by the SSC, the duplicated calls are closed. Under
normal circumstances, where a duplicate incident is identified by the SSC, this will be reported
back to the HSH/HIT/SMC and closed as a duplicate incident on PinICL.

No duplicated incidents passed 4" line support.

d) To ensure that the correct evidence for any problem is collected prior to the incident being passed
to 4 line support for investigation. Where appropriate, this should also contain the method of
recreation of the problem.

No calls rejected by 4" line support on the basis that the evidence was inadequate. Specifically
excluded from this measure are instances where, although the evidence was inadequate, 4°
line support had not indicated to the SSC the evidence that would be required for such an
incident.

ce) To ensure that any incident which requires investigation by 4" line support is assigned to the
correct PinICL team dependent on the specific product in which the incident has occurred.

No calls misrouted because of incorrect assignment by SSC

f) To ensure that if there are any updates made to incidents passed to the SSC, then these are sent to
the 4" line support units in the same manner as e).

No cases of incident updates received by the SSC not being passed to 4" line support.

g) To ensure that any calls passed to 4" line support units are passed in a timely manner. The exact
timings are detailed in appendix B of this document. The timings will vary according to the total
time allowed for resolution of the problem in the contract between Fujitsu Services Pathway and
the customer. These timings will therefore be dependant on the priority of the incident, with (for
example) less time allowed for an “A” priority call than will be permitted for a “C” priority.

No cases of incidents passed to 4" line outside of the specified times in appendix B

j) To ensure that for any incident passed to 4" line support, the exact area of the problem has been
identified, and wherever possible a workround already produced and passed to the release
authorisation process.

No cases identified by 4” line support staff of inadequate diagnosis by SSC

k) To ensure that for any code error a probable solution is indicated prior to passing to 4° line
support, and wherever possible, the possible solution has undergone limited testing.

1) For areas of the Pathway solution where the product has “matured”, ie, no further releases of the
product are expected, accept full responsibility for the product (including 4" line support and
responsibility for the production of any code required to resolve incidents).

To ensure that the incident is resolved within the total time allowed by the contract between the
customer and Fujitsu Services Pathway.

No justified complaints from the HSH/HIT/SMC regarding late resolution of problems, no
invocation of penalty clauses by the customer because of slow resolution of incidents.

most cases the provision of the fix is at the discretion of the Release Management forum, and
the target for the provision of any fix therefore is as specified in this forum

e) To ensure that the SSC is made aware of the evidence requirements for any form of incident. This
will be documented by the SSC and maintained in accordance with the SSC obligations to
HSH/HIT/SMC.

No cases to arise of SSC not knowing the evidence required to be collected for any call. A
specific exception to this would be the situation in which a completely new type of call was
received, causing the SSC to update the relevant documentation following specification of the
evidence from 4" line support.

f) To enter resolution information into the known error register maintained by the SSC.

No discrepancy to arise between the known resolutions for problems and those, which are
documented, on the known error system.

solution in sufficient time to enable SSC staff to become familiar with the product prior to its
release, and in sufficient time to enable the SSC to adequately train HSH/HIT/SMC staff. The
SSC preference for this documentation would be a support guide. An outline description of the
contents of'a support guide is given in Appendix C

SSC to be supplied with such documentation for any release at least 3 weeks prior to MOR for
that product release, and preferably as a continual process during the course of development.

i) To ensure that the SSC is supplied with access to source code developed within Pathway
development (with the exception of Riposte).

responsibility, documentation, source code, and training are made available to the SSC.

Appendix A - Definition of call priorities

A- BUSINESS STOPPED, a Post Office down, unable to process any
business, or central system failure which will result in a number of Post
Offices being unable to process work.

B- BUSINESS RESTRICTED, a Post Office restricted in its ability to
transact business, e.g. one counter down.

C-  NON-CRITICAL, a Post Office working normally but with a known
disability, e.g. an interim solution (workround) has been provided.

D- INTERNAL, an internal HSH/HIT/SMC problem, e.g. a help desk PC or a
phone set inoperable.

Appendix B - Definition of call priorities

The commitment to the customer with regard to resolving software calls is as
follows -

A Priority - 2 working days
B Priority - 4 working days
C Priority - 7 working days
D Priority - 28 working days

It is expected that although calls may enter the SSC at high priority, in the
majority of cases the SSC will produce a workround for the problem, and at this
stage the priority of the call will be reduced in order to provide 4" line support
with sufficient time to seek a code resolution.

Since it is incumbent upon the SSC to produce a workround, and on 4" line
support units to produce the final code solution to any software problem, for the
majority of its “life” any incident should be with those units.

The target times within each line of support for each call therefore should be...

A priority

HSH / HIT/SMC to be transferred to SSC not later than 0.5 hour after being
logged

SSC to be transferred to 4" line not later than 1 working day
after initial logging

4" line to resolve not later than 2 working days after initial
logging.
