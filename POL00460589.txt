Nigel,

We haven’t spoken before so welcome to Post Office and by way of introduction I’m the Interim Group Legal Director,
reporting into Sarah. I understand that you asked Diane Wills to provide you with short summaries (approx. 2 pages) of
both the Common Issues Judgment and Horizon Issues Judgment. Diane’s team didn’t have these summaries and asked

if the Legal BAU team could help. Please find attached the summaries requested.

If you would like any further information in relation to these judgments or a more detailed briefing on certain aspects of
the judgments just let me know.

Kind regards,
Christian
