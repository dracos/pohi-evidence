Hi,
I thought it may be useful to share where we are up to in respect of our response to Part Two.

e¢ I have been through our original reply to their original report and tweaked & added words to cover, where
warranted, any new assertions / points made over and above those included in their original report

e¢ Where I did not know the process / technical process aspects, Angela has fed in and Andy P is drafting some
additional lines.

® Once this is complete, the report is (today) being shared with Paul Lorraine who will sense check and double
check we have not missed anything important that we need to rebut / comment on.

e — I will then tidy up and share with Angela and Rod on Monday morning for proofing and legal sign off. Though
of course everyone is welcome to read and comment.

® We should then be able to share a draft of our Reply with SS (if we decide to — I am not sure we should but
we can discuss). Note: the section of Foreign Currency Transactions may not be included by Monday as it
needs to be drafted by Angela and Kath as it relates to M118
