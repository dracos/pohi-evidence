I write further to the aforementioned matter and confirm that we have received a disc
containing core data for the duration of the indictment period. As you are no doubt aware
this should have been served by the 5" October 2012 and if it is to be the subject of a
forensic report then that had to be served by the Defence on the 30" November 2012.

We respectfully write to inform you that it will be impossible for the Defence to comply with
the Judges order and at this present moment consideration is being given to listing the
matter for an Intervention Hearing, hopefully we will be able to also address the lack of
disclosure in respect of matters contained within paragraph 11 of our Defence Case
Statement and were the subject of our letter on the 8" October 2012.

If you have any update whatsoever with regards to those matters then we ask that you
communicate them to us as soon as possible to prevent the need for an Intervention

Hearing as we may be able to deal with the matter administratively.

Yours faithfflly
