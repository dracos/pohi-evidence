I have been working with a journalist at Private Eye magazine over the past few weeks,
and a piece on the Post Office Horizon system leads the investigative section "In the Back"
in this fortnight's issue (No 1298 30 Sep - 13 Oct p.28).
These have prompted dozens of prosecutions and financial ruin for businessmen and
women with previously spotless records. Fifty-five of them last week launched a “class
action” against the Post Office, arguing that their troubles owe more to computer error
than dishonesty
The Post Office remains the only body in the UK to run its own prosecutions and
campaigners think that if it had to use the Crown Prosecution Service, many cases would
not have made it to court. The last organisation with such powers, Customs & Excise, was
stripped of them almost a decade ago when it was found to have over-stepped the mark in
several high-profile cases

I would urge any disaffected Subpostmasters reading this to get in touch NOW. As far as I
understand it, part of the process of mediation is that you will be required to signa
gagging order which stops you, under threat of being sued, from talking to anyone,
especially journalists, about any settlement or agreement you make with the Post Office.

What I'm not clear on is whether the gagging order is signed before any settlement is
agreed, or whether it's signed as part of the settlement. I can't imagine it's the former, but
I did hear someone suggest it was.

Even assuming it's only signed on agreement of settlement, it's not ideal. You'll (hopefully)
get some money back, but you won't be able to protest your innocence or tell the story of
what happened to you to anyone, ever again.

case is discussed.

He asks that PO does not utilise any time barred limitation point in resisting legal claims;

plenty more which they are successfully suppressing, but they are being called out on it, by

Remember News International and their absolute total denial that anyone was phone
hacking other than Clive Goodman?

All the Post Office are admitting to at the moment is that they could have done a few
(unspecified) things better.

The full horror of what Post Office "auditors", "investigators" and prosecutors have done
to dozens of subpostmasters and the basis on which they have done it has not yet fully
