Subject: FW: PC0087709: PinICL - call transferred to Escher-Dev
mbocor02_tidy.zip

lain,
I've had a look at this one and there's nothing much to add to what the PinICL already says.

Please can you pass it on to Escher. We've seen a number of cases of the event 82 in the past, however usually they have been "one-
offs" and benign. In this case the agents are repeatedly failing with the agent timeouts coinciding with the event 82s. As the PinICL
says, the first error was an Event 89 which I don't remember seeing before.

I'm copying this to Mark in case he has anything to add and I've added on the Event Log in .xls format (zipped) with the relevant
events highlighted.

Regards
Gareth
