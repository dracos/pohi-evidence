Version Changes

2.0 [Document only changes (e.g arising from the Horizon System User
(Guide review) (CP2754) — see below.

Section 3.1.1 Daily desktop reload — reworded as follows:

‘There is a daily desktop reload which is necessary to reconfigure applications and
also to reconfigure the Training Service. To ensure minimum service disruption, the
reload will be scheduled to occur when no user is logged on at a counter during the
period between 03:00 hours and 04:00 hours. If a user has been logged on since
03:00 hours, an advisory prompt will be output asking the user to log out to enable
the reload to take place [Message Hard messages Access control and user
administration: 3 am system reload]. The prompt occurs between 03:00 hours and
03:30 hours approximately. Should the user not log out before 03:30 hours then the
overnight reload will not take place for that counter. Such occurrences will be
monitored._

If the desktop is not reloaded, ICL Pathway reference data updates may be affected.
Product reference data changes are not affected as they are picked up whether the
desktop is reloaded or not._

In the event of a LAN failure, the delivery of reference data is not affected so long as
one counter at the outlet (usually this will be the Gateway workstation) has received

the data. When the other counters become reconnected to the LAN, they have their

reference data updated from the Gateway.’

Medium term closure bullet point changed to read:

e Medium term closure (also known as a planned temporary closure).’

Access to menus in the hierarchy depends upon the user’s role. Users’
access rights to functions and procedures are described in the Horizon OPS
Menu Hierarchy: Release 2 [Ref. SD/SPE/016].

The screen messages described in this PPD are summarised and suffixed
with a cross-reference in the form: ‘[Message Collection:ObjectName] where
Collection is the Collection name and ObjectName is the ObjectName within
this collection (or for hard-coded messages, the context and caption of the
message). These relate to an entry in Horizon OPS Desktop Messages and
Help Text: CSR+[Ref. SD/DOC/009] that defines the text of the message.

The Horizon System Helpdesk calls described in this PPD are cross-
referenced to the calls described in the CSR+ Horizon System Helpdesk PPD
[Ref. CS/PRO/092] as follows: ‘Telephone the Horizon System Helpdesk [Call
Type:Problem]’ where Type is the call type and Problem is the problem within
this type, for example Hardware:counter printer fault. (Note that these cross-
references are provided solely to assist PPD reviewers; the call references
are not relevant to the helpdesk callers.)

3 Overview

The CSR+ operating environment consists of the following components:
e Counter system environment described in Section 3.1.

« Office hardware described in Section 4.

e The Horizon software described in Sections 5, 6 and 7.

3.1 Counter system environment

The counter system environment constitutes an office software suite of
applications comprising:

e Order Book Control Service (OBCS) - a facility for checking bar-coded
order books against a national system stop list.

e Automated Payment Service (APS) - support for utility companies and
others who provide payment mechanisms based on cards and other
tokens.

« Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS) - support for customers
purchasing all other goods or services available from POCL as well as
accounting, reporting and administration functions.

« The Logistics Feeder Service (LFS) which works in conjunction with the
SAP Advanced Distribution System (SAPADS) to create a replenishment
and return service for cash, value and non-value stock.

A PPD document has been produced for each of the above services. Please
refer to the Section 0.3 Associated documents for the reference numbers of
these documents.

3.1.1 Daily desktop reload

There is a daily desktop reload which is necessary to reconfigure applications
and also to reconfigure the Training Service. To ensure minimum service
disruption, the reload will be scheduled to occur when no user is logged on at
a counter during the period between 03:00 hours and 04:00 hours. If a user
has been logged on since 03:00 hours, an advisory prompt will be output
asking the user to log out to enable the reload to take place [Message Hard
messages Access control and user administration: 3 am system reload]. The
prompt occurs between 03:00 hours and 03:30 hours approximately. Should
the user not log out before 03:30 hours, then the overnight reload will not take
place for that counter. Such occurrences will be monitored.

If the desktop is not reloaded, ICL Pathway reference data updates may be
affected. Product reference data changes are not affected as they are picked
up whether the desktop is reloaded or not.

In the event of a LAN failure, the delivery of reference data is not affected so
long as one counter at the outlet (usually this will be the Gateway
workstation) has received the data. When the other counters become
reconnected to the LAN, they have their reference data updated from the
Gateway.

4 The Horizon hardware

This section describes the Horizon hardware. For information on maintaining
the Horizon equipment, see Section 8, Equipment maintenance. For
information on installing consumables, see Section 9, Installing consumables.
For information on reporting faults, see Section 11, Reporting faults.

Outlet staff are required to use the Horizon equipment as supplied and no
attempt should be made to modify or replace it.

The hardware consists of the following components:

e Monitor (including touch-screen)

e Keyboard (including magnetic and smart card reader/encoder)
e Bar-code reader

e Processor

e Counter printer

« Office printer (either inkjet or laser)

4.1 What is a node?

A node is the term used for the set of Horizon equipment used at a counter
position - the PC and its associated peripherals. A node is sometimes
referred to as a counter position.

Within an outlet each node has its own node ID number, this is a unique
terminal identifier within the outlet. Node 1 is the Gateway PC, other nodes
may run from 2 to 31 and Nodes 32 to 64 are reserved for the
correspondence servers.

The user can view node information by selecting the Node information option
from the Desktop. The system displays the user, build, site group, node ID,

node name and the licensee. Having viewed the information, the user selects
the Tick option to return to the Desktop

4.2. Monitor (including touch-screen)

There are two types of monitor:
e The MicroTouch 10” colour monitor.
e The Flat Panel Display (FPD) monitor.

The purpose of the monitor is to display information relating to the current
activity. The monitor has an on/off switch, brightness controls and a Power-
On indicator light. The height and width controls are blanked off on the outlet
equipment to prevent adjustment of these features since this would affect the
touch screen operation.

The monitor has a 10-inch colour touch-sensitive screen; the touching of
certain buttons and text fields allows the user to communicate with the
processor. The touching, however, must only be done by human fingers,
positioned directly in front of the screen, and not by other foreign objects such
as a pen or pencil. You touch the appropriate area of the screen and then
remove your finger.

4.2.1 Switching the monitor on and off

The monitor should normally be switched on at the beginning of the day and
switched off at the end of the day. If the system is not being used for a period
of an hour or more, the monitor can be switched off and then switched on
when the system is to be used again.

For a definition of the way in which screen buttons and navigation/command
keys map on to each other, see Appendix A in the Horizon Office Platform
Service Style Guide [Ref. SD/STD/001].

Magnetic card reader

The magnetic card reader allows the system to read the information stored in
the magnetic strip of a swipe card. This information is used to support various
customer transactions.

To swipe a magnetic card:
Step 1. Pick up card.

Step 2. Ensure magnetic strip is facing you and on the bottom of the
card.

Step 3. Place card in either left or right hand side of magnetic card
reader slot ensuring it rests firmly on the bottom of the slot.

Step 4. Pull the card from left to right, or right to left, through the slot.

Smart card reader/encoder

The smart card reader/encoder allows smart card information to be processed
by the system to support various AP transactions (see the CSR+ APS PPD
[Ref. CS/PRO/091]).

The smart card reader also accesses the Post Masters’ Memory Cards
(PMMCs) which are supplied with the system and are used for Post Office
Logon (POLO) start up procedures (see the CSR+Access Control and User
Administration PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/090)).

To insert a card into the smart card reader:
Step 1. Pick up card.

Step 2. Ensure that the gold contact pad is facing you.
Step 3. Insert card gently but firmly into the smart card reader until it
touches the bottom of the slot.
4.3.6.1 Magnetic card reader and smart card reader/encoder’s lights
The magnetic card reader's lights indicate the following:
e Orange: reading
e Red: read of a correctly positioned valid card unsuccessful
« Green: read successful

In general, three attempts should be made to scan the magnetic card and
then, if the card still has not been read successfully, the user should enter the
information manually by keying in the appropriate details from the front of the
card.

When a smart card is inserted in the smart card reader, the reader light
changes to orange to indicate that the card is being read.

If the reader light changes to red, there is a fault in the reader or smart card.
A call should be made to the Horizon System Helpdesk [Call Hardware:Smart
card reader fault]

4.4 Bar-code reader

The bar-code reader is hand-held and is used to read bar-coded characters.

Note: the bar-code reader should not, under any circumstances, be pointed
at anyone’s eyes.

4.4.1 Scanning a bar-code
To scan a bar-code:
Step 1. Ensure bar-code is facing upward.

Step 2. Place bar-code reader over bar-code at distance of
approximately 3 inches or 7 centimetres.

Step 3. Pull trigger on bar-code reader.

Step 4. The bar-code reader will beep if the scan is successful. If it does
not beep, the scan is unsuccessful.

Note: in general, you should make three attempts to scan the bar-code and
then, if the bar-code has still not been read successfully, enter the bar-code
manually by keying in the numbers shown under the bars.

4.5 Processor

The processor device’s function is to run the Application Suite of software
and process information. It has a Power-On indicator light and an On/Off
switch.

The single-counter processors used for CSR+ have a fixed hard drive and a

removable hard drive. The removable hard drive is found in the middle of the
front of the processor, and looks like a slightly larger than normal floppy disk
drive, but also has a lock. The user is not required to remove the drive at any
time and therefore the key to the lock is not delivered with the equipment.

The multi-counter processors used for CSR+ have a fixed hard drive only.

Notes:

«e The processor must not be switched off at any time, unless moving a
trolley, in an emergency or if the user is instructed to switch it off by
the Horizon System Helpdesk. Shutting down a processor is
described in the CSR+ Access Control and User Administration PPD
[Ref. CS/PRO/090]

e The processor will need to be restarted if the user needs to perform
the lost PIN/PMMC, change PIN or PMMC security data update
procedures. Shutting down and restarting a processor is described
in the CSR+ Access Control and User Administration PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/090}.

e Ifthe processor is switched off by accident, the outlet manager must
follow the procedure to regain access to a switched-off or restarted
workstation. Regaining access to a switched-off workstation is
described in the CSR+ Access Control and User Administration PPD
[Ref. CS/PRO/090].

Switching the counter printer on and off

The Power On/Off switch is located at the rear of the printer. The Ready light
is lit when the printer is ready to print.

The counter printer should normally be switched on at the beginning of the
day and switched off again at the end of the day. If the system is not being
used for a period of one hour or more, the counter printer can be switched off
and then switched on again when it is next required.

Inserting a slip into the counter printer
To insert a slip into the printer:
Step 1. Orientate slip face up with top furthest away from you.

Step 2. Insert slip into bottom slot of counter printer to the far right of
the aperture- push forward until resistance is felt.

Step 3. Grip slip at bottom ensuring that both sheets are gripped and
taut.

Removing a receipt from the counter printer

Care should be taken when removing a receipt from the printer. The user
should give the printer time to finish printing the receipt and take care not to
pull the receipt out too quickly. If the receipt is pulled out too quickly, it is
possible that not all the printed details will appear on the receipt.

Action to take if the tally roll paper becomes torn while a receipt is being
printed

If the tally roll paper tears and the paper is not feeding through while a receipt
is being printed, printing continues. The Horizon software cannot detect the
fact that the paper is not feeding through correctly.

If this occurs, the user must remove the torn section of paper or install a new
tally roll as described in Section 9.1.1 Counter printer consumables and
reprint the receipt using the Reprint Receipt function as described in Section
7.4.3 Receipt and Reprint Receipt function.

Action to take if a receipt is printed when the print ribbon cassette has
been removed from the counter printer

If the print ribbon cassette is removed from the counter printer, the printer
continues to function. The Horizon software cannot detect the fact that the
printer does not have a print ribbon cassette loaded.

4.8.2.2 Panasonic printer’s PRINT/RESET button

The PRINT/RESET button will execute one of the following functions
depending upon the status of the printer:

e Ifthe READY indicator light is on, press the PRINT/RESET button for
about 5 seconds to print a test page. You can then reset the printer by
pressing this button until the three indicator lights are lit.

e If the READY indicator light is blinking slowly, press the PRINT/RESET
button for about 5 seconds to print the remaining data. You can then reset
the printer by pressing this button until the three indicator lights are lit.

4.8.3 Action to take if the Panasonic printer runs out of paper while printing a
report

If the printer tries to print a page and detects that there is no paper, printing
ceases and the printer’s red error LED flashes. The system becomes aware
of the problem with the printer and displays the printer error screen asking the
user to check the printer and then giving retry print and cancel print options
[Message EPOSS:MSG180].

The user should add more paper and then press the PRINT/RESET button on
the front of the printer briefly (less than 5 seconds). This causes the printer to
resume printing after a short delay. If the user presses the PRINT/RESET
button on the front of the printer for more than 5 seconds the printer is reset
and the report being printed will contain garbled text. For this reason, if a
Panasonic laser printer is reset while a report is being run, the current report
