hen they completed the balance on 6th Feb and cleared the loss from Local
suspense, the amount cleared was £9839.45 instead of the loss they had put into
local suspense, which was £39.57.

IThis appears to be a consequence of something that happened during the previous
ITP rollover on 2nd Jan: a 'gain to local suspense’ of £9799.88 was included in
ithe DEF opening figures.

I don't think any of the local suspense products should ever appear in opening
figures, however I have found 14 such lines (all prod 6295 Gain to LS, all
different branches). Unfortunately all created Nov-Dec last year, so there is
almost no remaining counter evidence.

suspense report for TP9 (2nd Jan 2013) received, which shows no anomaly. I
thought it might show 9799.88- c/f, since that amount is b/f on the TP10
report, but it doesn't.

IThe branch also sent the suspense report for TP10 2012, with the comment that
they had the same problem last year - and although it is a very faint copy, it
lappears to show 9799.88- b/f.

still to be investigated:

Exactly how did these records cause the observed effect?
Why were the records not removed by the normal archiving process?

What impact has the problem had on the branch accounts?

What impact has the problem had on POLSAP?

How do we remove the records to prevent future problems?

Were there any affected branches which have since closed?

I-There are 19 other branches which have old data in the affected table, but not
relating to Local Suspense ? could this cause any problems with the branch
accounts? (some may be temporarily closed).

Further investigations:

** Exactly how did these records cause the observed effect?

Ithe old data is picked up, along with the correct data, during the Branch
Itrading Statement production (at the end of the period BEFORE the problem is
isible at the branch). The old opening figure (which may be for one or more of
the Local Suspense products 6295-6298, associated with an unknown stock unit)
lgets converted during branch rollover, to prod 6295 Gain to Local Suspense
(though the sign may be positive or negative), and written as an opening figure
for the subsequent period, stock unit DEF.

t the end of the second period, this is included when the amount to be cleared
from Local Suspense is calculated (when the last stock unit is rolled over), so

ithe branch is forced to clear it.

t* How to identify the problem from branch reports:

Branch Trading Statement: the sum of the two Discrepancy Transferred lines does
Inot match the total of the two Discrepancy Resolved Lines

suspense Account report: the B/Fwd figure on the report does not match the
Ic/Fwd figure on the report for the previous TP.

"* Why were the records not removed by the normal archiving process? The
records, created Autumn 2010, belonged to stock units that have since been
leleted. Normally they would have been removed before the ‘deleted stock unit!
lentry itself was removed from the list of stock units, but there were some
teething problems with archiving and they were ‘orphaned' and are now ignored
y the archiving process.

** How do we remove the records to prevent future problems? Once well away from
the problem TP, eg once into TP 1, get the branches to recreate a stock unit
ith the same name as the problem one, then delete it again. Or we just delete
them from the database under MSC.

** Were there any affected branches which have since closed? I have checked
ranches closed within the last 90 days, all ok. For branches closed longer ago
hich might be under investigation, the suspense account reports and BTS could
checked (see above).

s+ There are 19 other branches which have old data in the affected table, but
Inot relating to Local Suspense ? could this cause any problems with the branch
accounts?

IT have checked very carefully and conclude that these extra lines have no
ongoing impact on the branch accounts.

k* There is old data in some other tables that use the same archiving strategy
I this doesn't affect the branch balancing in the same way, but what would
appen if a stock unit with the same name was recreated?

** Any corrective actions?
Ihocal suspense should always be zero when the branch is rolled over - should
this be checked and reported?

I think the archiving strategy is now ok, but this may need to be reviewed.

still to do:
k* What impact has the problem had on the branch accounts?
k* What impact has the problem had on POLSAP?

28th Feb about this call, and the spreadsheet showing the impact of the problem
lon the 14 branches was sent to them by Steve Bansal. We are waiting to hear
from Mark whether this is sufficient information for them to resolve the
consequences on the branches and POLSAP.

je will then need to get the old data causing the problem removed from the
database (before TP 9 - Oct-Nov 2013) and consider whether extra checks should
put in place to trap similar anomalies in the future.

Ican we add an extra check into the branch balancing process so errors like this
ould be reported in future (similar to the event which is raised if the BTS
ITrading position is not zero)?

Possible checks are

la) do the next TP's Opening Figures, generated for stock unit DEF, include any
ILocal Suspense products? (raise event if they don't net to zero value)

) does the sum of the two Discrepancy Transferred lines on the BTS, for the
Branch Total, equal the sum of the two Discrepancy Resolved lines? (raise event
if not).

For the problem under investigation here, the first check would have identified
la problem when branch 11458 rolled into TP 10, and the second check at the end
lof TP 10.

nalysis and Root cause:

lcenerally all Local suspense movement transactions are written during stock
lunit TP rollover (6295/6296),during last stock unit rollover, and also from the
Housekeeping menu (6297/6298) .

lon office rollover, local suspense from branch opening figures and movements
for all stock units are netted off, and should result in 0 value carried
forward.

Ihen Office rollover ,the previous suspense opening figures and suspense
jovements for current trading period are summed, netted off, and written as new
suspense opening figures to SU DEF.

In the present scenario,the previous local suspense movements for a deleted
Istockunit are retained in BRANCH BTS DATA. (i.e £9799.88).This Local suspense
record was not cleared while next office rollover since SU was deleted.

fter 205 days the stock unit was created with same name So sytem summed off
lold non-zero local suspense movements amount from BRANCH BTS DATA along with Ls

jovements from present trading period. (i.e £9799.88 + £39.57 = £9839.45).
IReproducing Steps:

ll. Create a stock unit 'SUl'and attach to present user.

2. Carry out a local supense transaction by declaring cash £100 for SU1.

3. Rollover all stockunits to next TP.

4. Attach user to another stock unit and delete stockunit SUL.

5. Rollover Office to next TP. (Here system doesn't complain about LS record of
IsUl since it was deleted.)

6. Change system date to after 205 days.

7. carry out a local supense transaction by declaring stock £23 for present SU.

8. Create a stock unit with same name which is deleted 'SUL'.
9. Rollover office to next Tp.

LO. Suspense Roport and Office Trading statement shows total clearted amount
lfor current TP is £123. (Evidence attached).
