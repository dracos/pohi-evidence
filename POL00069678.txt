Telephone attendance

Client: Royal Mail Group PLC Sub Postmaster Litigation

Matter: Mr Lee Castleton Matter no: 348035.134
Attending:

Name: Stephen Dilley Location: N/A Date: 21 November 2006
Start time: Units:

I had a telephone conversation with Mandy Talbot, updating her on what had transpired ie:

1. Mr Castleton is now acting in person;

2. On Friday he told his solicitors that they did not have permission sign off the
Consent Order;

3. We were therefore cracking on with preparing the case for trial and moving full

steam ahead.
Mandy expressing her frustration that Mr Castleton had not signed up to a deal that he had
proposed in the first place and agreeing with her, but saying that we just needed to get the
matter on to trial. However, it was going to be difficult to achieve as good a result as that
being negotiated in terms of the settlement.
I will continue to keep Mandy updated.
I also said that I have instructed our expert to top off their work by producing a report and
Mandy agreed with this. We can then decide whether or not to use it. Explaining that Mr
Castleton is now too late to serve an expert report.

The next steps are that we need to get the amended and signed defence from him since that
has not yet been served.

Time engaged: 18 minutes.
