Dear Angela

This is just a brief email to introduce myself. I have been asked by Victoria Brooks to assist in the drafting of your
witness statement and I am based in this firm's Southampton office.

I appreciate that we have quite a detailed proof of evidence for you already and — given you are on holiday from 11 to
23 July inclusive - I propose to turn that proof into a draft witness statement while you are on holiday so that you have

it to consider upon your return.

In the statement I will try to anticipate what your answers are likely to be to the questions we have but I anticipate there
will be some points I cannot address without either meeting you or speaking with you on the phone.

I trust this all makes sense but please contact me if you have any queries.

Kind regards

Ivan
