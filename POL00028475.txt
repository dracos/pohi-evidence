Subject Success Criteria for 218

All

Draft criteria statement attached. Have attempted to consolidate outstanding aspects gleaned
from actions, with other specifics discussed separately with Bruce.

218SuccessCriteria.do

Bruce & Steve
Please can you look at items 5 and 6. These are lifted from the actions but are far from clear in

terms of what we actually need to see. Can you be explicit so that we can provide this to
Pathway if these areas really need to be included in the ‘success criteria’.

Thanks

Ruth

218 Rectificati ivity -S Criteri

Minimum rectification activity to reclassify AI218 from HIGH to MEDIUM.

1. Pathway to provide a full specification of the Pre-training event for review by POCL. e. oct iat eae .

2. Pathway to provide a plan to deliver the Pre-training event to 20% of all outlet managers.
This will require 740 events assuming 10 attendees per course.

(Pathway’s rectification plan, version 1.0, reviewed on 26 August was based on 20% of the
network, hence the proposal being 370.)

3. Pathway to provide and cover the cost of training 350 RNMs (HFSO Training Course) to
partially alleviate the deficiency in the post training service. A plan to deliver this to be
issued.

4, Pathway to provide a robust resource plan for HSH level 3 calls to deal with balancing
and cash account difficulties experienced by users due to the deficiency in the training
event. This should include:

i) the rationale to explain how resource levels have been determined and how
these will be deployed;

ii) a plan to recruit and train the required resources;

iii) a proposal to measure the performance of the level 3 cash account call
handling service, ~. OCC acyren

5, Pathway to produce a draft note on monitoring training delivery for POCL review(action

242) Poet ager

6. Pathway to produce a rectification plan to progress performance measurement, promotion
of use of training event and 2 changes to training event (action 252)

Note

Criterion number 4 above creates a dependency on the rectification activity related to Al408.
This specific action has been tabled for review at the workshop scheduled for 9/9. As a result,
POCL will not be in a position to re-classify AI218 until this item has been cleared.

This will enable POCL to determine whether the level 3 resource plan is robust

This incident now has a critical dependency on the rectification activity required against
A1408. As item number 3 above will not be tabled for workshop review until 9 August,
POCL will be unable to reassess AI 218 until this date.
