                                   Witness Name: Lynn Pumford Hobbs

                                   Statement Number: WITNO9010100

                                   Dated: 6 July 2023


                           Post Office Horizon IT Enquiry




                FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF LYNN P HOBBS




I, Lynn Hobbs, will say as follows...


   Introduction

  1. I am completing this statement at the request of the Horizon Inquiry following

      receipt of a Rule 9 request dated 6 April 2023, relating to Phase 4 of the

      Inquiry and my involvement in action taken against Subpostmasters by Post

      Office Limited and my witness statement is in response to the questions asked

      in the annex attached to that request.



  2. I am a former Post Office employee having officially left the business in March

      2011. I started work in the Post Office in January 1972 as a counter clerk and

      during my career I covered numerous roles at various levels from clerical to

      senior management. At the time I left and from October 1986 I worked within

      Post Office Ltd (POL) previously Post Office Counters (POOL).



  3. This witness statement is based on my personal recollection of events, policies

      and processes and to this end I should add that my role in POL ceased in


                                        Page 1 of 28

                                                                                  WITN09010100




   December 2010 and I have limited recollection of the specifics of my roles

   within the business. I would also add that my memory has not only been

   affected by the passage of time but also by health issues I experienced during

   the last few years I was employed and I must therefore apologise if some of

   my responses appear vague.



4. I was given access to a very large number (93) policy, process and other

   documents by the enquiry to assist me in compiling this statement. During my

   discussion with a member of the inquiry solicitor team I queried why I had been

   asked to review documents dated after December 2010, the date I ceased

   working in POL. The inquiry accepted my point that to review documents dated

   after I had left the business may distort my recollection of events, policies and

   processes. I have therefore not reviewed any documents in my egress pack

   with a date later than December 2010 or any undated documents unless, on

   opening the document, it was immediately obvious that it was applicable to the

   period prior to December 2010; this reduced the number of documents I

   reviewed to 43, still, I believe, a substantial number. I have therefore limited

   my reading to certain paragraphs where these were specified.



5. After considering my personal known commitments in April and May, I

   requested a further five weeks to complete this statement, however, I was

   granted an additional two weeks.

                                                                                   WITNO9010100




6. I would also wish to make the inquiry aware that I took a conscious decision

   not to watch any broadcasts or read anything related to the Horizon Inquiry so

   this statement is my first and I trust my only involvement in the inquiry.



7. I have not sought legal representation in the drafting of this statement.



Relevant Background

8. During the time I worked for the business there were a number of re-

   organisations including the major reorganisation setting up Post Office

   Counters (POOL) and Parcelforce as separate businesses within the Royal

   Mail Group. POCL later became Post Office Ltd (POL) and there followed a

   number of internal reorganisations during my employment. As it is over twelve

   years since I left the business my recollection of job titles both my own and

   others may not be accurate.



9. I started working for the Post Office after leaving school when I was sixteen. I

   began my career working on the counter and held a number of clerical, junior

   and middle manager roles until I was promoted to my first senior manager role

   as Personnel and Services Manager, Leeds District, in 1989.



10. Following a business re-organisation in 1993/94 I became Head of HR for

   North East Region, followed by Head of Network Support and finally Head of

   Retail Network in 1999.

11. Head of Retail Network North (NE Region) 1999-Sept 2001 — I was one of two

   Heads of Retail Network in the North East Region and my area covered

   Newcastle, Darlington and York. I managed a team of Retail Network

   Managers (RNMs) who in turn were responsible for supporting around 1000

   Directly Managed, Franchise and Sub Post Offices.



12. Head of Network Reinvention (Sept 2001- April 2005) — I was responsible for a

   team which designed and delivered a radical programme to change the

   structure of the Post Office branch network.



13. General Manager Service (April 2005 - Sept 2006) — this was a transitional

   role. I was responsible for delivering a range of support services to all

   branches and enabling the development of a revised organisation structure.



14. General Manager, Network Support (previously Head of Outlet Support) (Oct

   2006- Dec 2010) — responsible for delivering performance standards,

   regulatory compliance, agents' contract management, staff training and

   latterly, following the merger of the training and audit teams, assuring business

   assets and compliance with 'in branch' transaction processes across the

   franchise / sub office network and for the completion of financial audits at

   Crown branches. During this time I also had responsibility for a several `one-

   off business projects for example the conversion of Crown branches to WH

   Smith franchise branches, the rollout of paypoint terminals to branches and

   providing in-branch support for the roll-out of Horizon On-line. I had 7 senior

   manager direct reports who were accountable for delivering the above Network

                                                                                  WITNO9010100




   Support responsibilities on a day to day basis which they did through a core

   team of 200 staff which increased when projects were undertaken.



Contractual liability of subpostmasters for shortfalls

15. I have been asked about my understanding of the contractual position relating

   to franchisees, and subpostmasters in terms of their responsibility for losses

   identified in their branches. My understanding was that they were responsible

   for making good losses in their branches although there were a number of

   circumstances in which full or partial relief could be granted. This differed from

   that of employees working in Crown (Directly Managed) branches in that

   employees were responsible for declaring any losses or gains over a specific

   amount (I think this may have been £5 but I cannot be certain) and there was a

   process, which I believe formed part of the discipline code, for manging how

   excessive numbers of misbalances were dealt with.



The audit process and the policies / practices in place

16. I've been asked to provide an account of my role as General Manager,

   Network Support and also to provide information on policies and procedures in

   place relating to audit practices. I was accountable for delivering performance

   standards, regulatory compliance, contract management, staff training and

   latterly, following the merging of the audit and training teams, I was

   responsible for delivering audit processes which were in place to ensure

   business assets and monitor compliance to specific processes, across a

   network of over 11,000 sub post office and franchise outlets. I was also

   responsible for providing audit resource to complete financial audits in the

                                                                                    WITNO9010100




   Crown network. I had a team of senior managers working to me and they and

   their teams were responsible for the day to day delivery of each of these

   accountabilities. In terms of policies and practices I am unable to provide any

   detail on these and can only say my recollection is that the Network Support

   team would have operated in line with policies, processes and practices in

   force at the time. I was specifically asked to consider seven documents in

   relation to this and other questions on organisational structure, however only

   document [POL00083966] — Audit Charter was relevant as the remainder were

   created after I left the business therefore my responses are mostly based on

   my recollections.



Organisational Structure

17. I have been asked to summarise the changes to the organisational structure of

   the audit team and to explain my understanding of the reasons behind them.

   There were a number of reorganisations during the time I was employed and I

   am unable to say how any of these impacted on the organisational structure of

   the audit team. I can however say that around 2008 (1 am not clear of the exact

   date but it would likely be March / April to coincide with the year-end) the audit

   team were merged with the training team to become the field support team

   with team members given additional training to upskill them to enable them to

   carry out audit and training tasks. Prior to this merger the audit team had, I

   believe, worked in the Risk and Compliance team which I believe was part of

   the Finance Directorate. Following the merger the team became part of the

   Network Support team which was part of the Network Directorate. The reason

   for the merger was in line with the business requirement to deliver the best



                                   Page 6 of 28
                                                                                   WITNO9010100
                                                                                 WITNO9010100




   outcome whilst also aiming to maintain and, where possible, reduce costs;

   merging these two teams and multi-skilling team members enabled more

   efficient use of resources.



18. In terms of the relationship between the audit team and other teams in POL my

   recollection is that on occasions the audit team received requests to audit

   specific branches from both the security and debt recovery teams when Post

   Office funds were considered to be at risk. Findings would be reported back to

   these teams and also the relevant contract manager if shortages in Post Office

   funds were discovered.



19. 1 have been asked whether I considered it important that the audit team had

   organisational independence. I was of the view that whilst the merging of the

   audit and training teams created a bigger team capable of completing audits at

   branches and being more responsive to training needs the team remained

   independent in terms of its requirement to confirm business assets and

   compliance with specific internal and external policies and processes.



20. I have also been asked whether I can recall any concerns being raised about

   the independence of POL's auditing activities and I cannot recall any concerns

   being raised with me about the integrity or independence of the audit process.

   I would add that the Risk and Compliance committee were fully aware of the

   proposed change before the merger took effect and the Network and Finance

   Directors were required to agree the structural change before it could proceed.

The audit process

21. I have been asked a number of questions about specifics of the audit process.

   In my role as General Manager, I was not involved in the day to day activity of

   the audit team and my responses are therefore based on my limited

   recollection of discussions with Network Support Managers about the

   processes followed by the team.



22. 1 have been asked about the sources of information an auditor would have

   been expected to consider when completing an audit and also to discuss

   whether information varied according to the type of audit being conducted.

   From memory I am unable to say what specific information was considered by

   an auditor when completing an audit. However, I have been given access to

   the document catalogued as [POL00084801] which is Chapter 3 of the Audit

   Process Manual and is entitled "Performing a Branch Audit". This covers this

   particular point in detail. I have already stated that the Network Support team

   would have operated in line with policies, processes and practices in force at

   the time and I therefore do not feel I can add anything to this document or that

   spending a significant amount of time summarising that document in this

   statement would add value.



23. My understanding is that if a discrepancy was discovered during an audit the

   auditor would recheck their work and have a conversation with the

   subpostmaster to try and identify other areas to check. My understanding was

   that the auditor would aim to identify the cause of any shortfall before finalising

   the audit in branch and would involve the subpostmaster in trying to identify



                                   Page 8 of 28
                                                                                     WITNO9010100
                                                                                 WITNO9010100




   the cause of any shortfall. I am unable to provide any further details on

   additional enquiries or investigations the auditor would carry out.



24. 1 have been asked if I was aware auditors had been given instructions on

   taking payments from subpostmasters. I was not aware of any such

   instructions. My understanding was that if the outcome of the audit was a

   shortfall in funds the subpostmaster was asked if he/she was able to make

   good the shortfall or asked for proposals for making good the shortfall. If the

   shortage was over a specific amount or the subpostmaster had concerns

   about making good the shortfall the auditor contacted the relevant Contract

   Manager for advice.



25. 1 have been asked about whether a subpostmaster could carry out their own

   investigations if a shortfall was discovered. My understanding is that on the

   day of the audit the auditor would discuss the shortfall with the subpostmaster

   to try and identify possible causes and also that the subpostmaster would have

   access to the Horizon system to carry out checks to try and identify the reason

   for any shortfall. However, in a case where the contract advisor determined

   the subpostmaster should be suspended pending further investigation, I do not

   think the subpostmaster would be able to access Horizon data after the

   suspension.



26.1 have been asked about what information was communicated to

   subpostmasters while an audit was in progress. Subpostmasters were

   expected to remain in the secure area whilst the audit was being conducted to



                                  Page 9 of 28
                                                                                     WI TN09010100
                                                                                  WITNO9010100




   ensure they were satisfied with the process being followed and to answer any

   questions the auditor had. I am aware that in reality this did not always

   happen as the majority of subpostmasters had other business activities

   running alongside their post offices. However, my recollection is that when

   any discrepancies were identified these were discussed with the

   subpostmaster or their representative and they would have an opportunity to

   check what the auditor had found to ensure they were satisfied with the

   findings.



27. I have been asked whether there was an opportunity for subpostmasters to

   raise issues or concerns during an audit and my recollection is that anything

   the subpostmaster raised as a concern would have been relayed to the

   relevant contract manager.



28. 1 have been asked whether it was possible to conduct a branch audit when the

   Horizon system could not be accessed. I have read document [POL00084003]

   which provides detailed instructions on completing a post incident audit in

   circumstances where the Horizon equipment in branch is damaged and this

   confirmed my recollection that a full audit could not be completed without

   access to the Horizon system in branch.



29. My recollection of a Crown Office audit is that this did not necessarily involve a

   check of every individual stock in the branch whereas a sub post office audit

   did. I believe the reason for this was because Crown Office branch managers

   checked individual clerks' stock units on a rotational basis.

                                                                                  WITNO9010100




30. I have been asked about involvement Fujitsu had in the audit process and I am

   unable to say whether Fujitsu had any involvement in the audit process. In

   providing my response I have considered the document [FUJ00001894] Fujitsu

   Services Audit Trail Function Specification (v8.0), however, as this is a

   document I cannot recall ever seeing my answer is based only on my

   recollection.



31. I have been asked about information an auditor may have when conducting an

   audit that was not available to the subpostmaster. I believe the only

   information an auditor may have had would have been information related to

   specific reasons for the audit if it had been requested by another team from

   POL e.g. the Security team.



32. 1 have been asked about my understanding of the Audit Global User Account

   and been asked to consider document [POL00002841] in giving my response.

   This document is dated September 2016 so I have not considered it and can

   say that I have no recollection of the Audit Global User Account and therefore

   cannot comment on the specific workings of the tool or information contained

   within it.



Reporting and oversight

33.1 have been asked about the role of the Risk and Compliance Committee and

   about my involvement with the committee. From recollection and by

   referencing relevant documents I would say that the role of the Risk and



                                  Page 11 of 28
                                                                                     WITNO9010100
                                                                                  WITNO9010100




   Compliance Committee was to review business performance in relation to

   financial, legal and operational compliance, and specific business projects, to

   enable current and potential business risks to be identified and understood and

   to direct future activity to enable business risks to be minimised. I became a

   member of the committee in March 2008. I assume I would have remained a

   member of this committee until the latter part of 2010 but am unable to confirm

   that.



34. I have been asked to comment on my involvement in the analysis or review of

   the actual audit process. My involvement was in the merging of the audit and

   training teams. I cannot recall any specific involvement in any analysis or

   review of the audit process.



35. 1 have been asked to say whether I considered the audit process to be fit for

   purpose and also to comment on whether I now feel the process was fit for

   purpose. I am able to say that during the time I had overall responsibility for

   the audit process I was satisfied that it was fit for purpose otherwise I would

   have initiated a review of the process. I would add that it is easy to say with

   hindsight that any process could be improved.




36.1 have been asked to explain my involvement in error notices, transaction

   corrections and acknowledgements, branch discrepancies, "corrective action"

   taken against subpostmasters and recovery of agents' debt and to explain

   policies and practices in place at the time. I have been asked to clarify my

   response by roles I covered, dates and policies relevant at the time. I have

                                                                                    WITNO9010100
                                                                                WITN09010100




   been asked to address a number of documents as part of my response. I am

   unsure of the level of detail I am expected to provide, however, having read

   the documents I have been asked to refer to [POL88904], [NFSP00000043],

   [NFSP00000169], [P0L00085794], [P0L00030562], [P0L00083951],

   [P0L00083952]' [P0L00005888], [POL00105417], [P0L00003060],

   [P0L00084012]' [P0L00084075], [FUJ00091215], [P0L00001642],

   [POL00088904], [POL00086845], and [POL00088867] I can see there is

   significant information in these in relation to how the above items were dealt

   with and where the responsibility lay for dealing with such items. I have

   therefore provided a brief summary of my involvement as I cannot recall

   specifics related to each of the above. I would also add that in carrying out my

   role and responsibilities I would have referenced appropriate policies and

   operated within the processes in force at the time, however, with the passage

   of time, I am unable to refer to specific policies and practices.


37. Between 1989 and 1993 I was Personnel & Services Manager at Leeds

   District and part of my role was to support Area Managers who were

   responsible for managing subpostmasters and Crown branches in their area. I

   would provide advice and guidance related to subpostmaster contractual

   matters which may have included issues related to error notices and agents

   debt.


38. Between 1999 and 2001 I was Head of Retail Network in the North East

   Region. I managed of team Retail Network Managers (13 or 14 I think) who

   were responsible for providing support to the branches in their area. As part of

                                                                                   WITN09010100




   my role I had responsibility for the write off of agents' debt up to a level of my

   financial authority.



39. Between 2005 and 2006 I was General Manager Services and from 2006 until

   late 2010 I was Head of Outlet Support / General Manager Network Support

   and in these roles I had responsibility for the write off of agents' debt up to a

   level of my financial authority.


40. In terms of my involvement in error notices, transaction corrections and

   acknowledgements, branch discrepancies, "corrective action" taken against

   subpostmasters and recovery of agents debt I am unable to provide specific

   details of my involvement but I would say I would probably have seen reports

   containing information, data and statistics and would also have provided

   advice and support if required by my direct reports on issues related to any of

   the above in my role as line manager.



    Error notices, transaction corrections, transaction acknowledgements

    and branch discrepancies

41. 1 have also been asked very specific points about error notices, transaction

   corrections, transaction acknowledgements and branch discrepancies and in

   each instance my response would have to be simply to search through

   documents and retype the statement in the document as I cannot add anything

   more to what is in the relevant documents I have been referred to.



42_ I have been asked what role the suspense account had in the accounting

   process followed by subpostmasters. I believe the suspense account was


                                      Page 14 of 28
                                                                                       WI TN09010100
                                                                                     WITNO9010100




   used by subpostmasters to hold losses following a misbalance pending further

   investigation and to 'settle' transaction corrections the subpostmaster wished

   to query. I think that by using this facility the cash account could be completed

   without the error showing as a loss or gain. This was a short term measure (I

   think items should have remained in suspense for no longer than 8 weeks) to

   enable further investigations.



43. 1 have been asked whether the only option available to a subpostmaster who

   received a transaction correction ("TC") they didn't understand or wished to

   challenge was to telephone NBSC Helpline. I do not understand this question

   as I have read the document "Debt Recovery Processes under Branch

   Trading" [POL 00085794] which clearly states that if a subpostmaster receives

   a TC they don't understand or they wish to challenge they should contact the

   telephone number given on the TC. Having looked at the example TC in the

   document I can say that I believe the telephone number on that example TC

   was not the NBSC Helpline number but a telephone number in what I knew to

   be the Product and Branch Accounting team in Chesterfield.



44.The document indicates that "Accept and Settle Centrally" was a facility

   available if a subpostmaster was not able to identify the reason for the

   discrepancy identified in the TC to enable further investigations to take place.



45.1 cannot say with any certainty that the "Accept and Settle Centrally" facility

   was the only option available to a subpostmaster if they considered the error

   was a result of a systems error but from recollection I would have to say I



                                    Page 15 of 28
                                                                                     WITNO9010100
                                                                                   WITN09010100




   believe such a challenge would be treated as an error requiring further

   investigation and that the subpostmaster would be advised to "Accept and

   Settle Centrally".



46. From recollection I would say that "Accept and Settle Centrally" was used to

   indicate further investigation was required and did not signify acceptance of

   debt liability as the investigation may have resulted in the TC being cancelled.



47. 1 cannot recall a block on steps to recover centrally settled debt, this may have

   been after I left POL so I am unable to say whether there was anything to

   distinguish disputed from undisputed debt.



48. 1 was not involved in the process for investigating challenged TCs and had no

   reason to think that the process for challenging errors was anything other than

   acceptable and designed to ensure TCs could be disputed and investigated.

   At the time I considered the process to be acceptable. In response to the

   question about whether I now consider the "settle centrally" process to be

   satisfactory again I would say that it is easy to say with hindsight that any

   process could be improved.




49.1 would accept that TCs were issued to branches on the assumption that the

   error had been created in branch and that the onus was on the subpostmaster

   to challenge TCs they considered were wrongly issued.




Recovery of current and former agents' debt

                                  Page 16 of 28
                                                                                      WITNO9010100
                                                                                    WITNO9010100




50.1 have been asked to explain the role of the P&BA team (later to be known as

   FSC) and also to explain my role in the recovery of current and former agents'

   debt. I have been asked to address a number of individual points as part of

   this question.



51. My understanding of the role of P&BA is that they were responsible for all

   matters related to branch transaction accounting and reconciliation to enable

   settlement with clients and for managing errors resulting from branch

   transactions with branches and with clients. I appreciate this may be a

   simplistic explanation of the role of that team. I cannot comment on whether

   the role changed after 2010.


52. If a subpostmaster chose the `settle centrally' option to manage a shortfall or a

   transaction correction this allowed time for further investigation. If further

   investigation did not resolve the shortfall the subpostmaster was required to

   make good the shortfall. I believe there was a follow-up process for

   outstanding amounts but I am unable to provide detail on that process. I've

   specifically been asked about the "dunning" process but I have no recollection

   of that process so am not able to comment.


53. If a subpostmaster would not or could not pay a debt I would expect this would

   have been referred to the Contract Manager to discuss next steps with the

   subpostmaster_



54. In some instances current subpostmasters were given the opportunity to repay

   debt by deductions from remuneration. This was dependent on the amount of



                                  Page 17 of 28
                                                                                   WITNO9010100
                                                                               WITN09010100




   the debt and subject to levels of scrutiny related to the number of occasions

   the subpostmaster had made use of this facility.


55. I'm unable to comment on the circumstances which would result in P&BA

   raising concerns about a branch although I would have expected that they

   would have certain triggers which would prompt such action.


56. In terms of recovery of debt from former subpostmasters my recollection is that

   this was the responsibility of a team in P&BA who also engaged with other

   business teams such as Security & Investigation and Legal Services. I am

   unable to describe the end to end process from memory however, from

   reading document [POL00084977] I can see that it involved attempts to

   recover the money by telephone, letters and further escalation to Security &

   Investigations and Legal Services always being mindful of the cost of recovery

   versus the actual cost of the debt.


57.1 cannot say with certainty but would not have expected P&BA to have any role

   in recovering debt from current or former crown office employees.




58. In terms of teams in POL involved in debt recovery and branch conformance in

   addition to P&BA and Network Support teams I believe Business Development

   Managers and Security and Investigation would also be involved. There may

   have been other teams with some involvement but I am unable to name these

   teams.




Relief from accounting losses / Write off processes

                                                                                 WITNO9010100




59.1 have been asked to explain the circumstances in which relief could be

   granted from accounting losses and / or debt written off. The most obvious

   circumstances were following robberies or burglaries when the full amount of

   the debt was written off unless there was very strong evidence of contributory

   negligence on behalf of the subpostmaster. New subpostmasters who had not

   previously run a Post Office branch were able to have losses written off during

   their first six weeks of trading. There were other instances where relief could

   be granted and there were policies in place to facilitate this [POL00088904],

   [P0L00086845] and [P0L00088867].



60. I have been asked how frequently a subpostmaster's debt was written off by

   POL. I am unable to answer this question as subpostmaster debt could be

   written off by a number of people in roles across the business.



Civil claims and other debt recovery proceedings

61. I have been asked about the circumstances which would result in civil claims

   or other debt recovery proceedings being instigated against current or former

   subpostmasters and against current or former Crown Office employees

   including whose decision it was to bring such proceedings and what role if any

   I had in the process. I have assumed this question refers to the involvement of

   processes external to the business and I cannot recall being part of the

   decision making process related to civil claims or other external debt recovery

   proceedings being instigated against current or former agents or current or

   former Crown Office employees.

62.1 am unable to comment on either the mediation scheme or any review

   undertaken by Second Sight as I understand these were undertaken some

   time after I left the business.




Suspension and termination

63. 1 have been asked to explain my involvement in policies and practices in place

   in respect of suspensions, terminations and the appeals process. I was

   involved to varying degrees with suspensions, terminations and the appeals

   process from 1989 to when my role ended in December 2010. 1 was trained

   as an Appeals Manager around 1993/94 (apologies I cannot remember the

   exact date) and remained a member of the Appeals panel until December

   2010. During that time I would have heard appeals from subpostmasters

   whose contracts had been terminated and employees who had been

   dismissed. Whilst I cannot provide specific details in respect of policies and

   processes I would have followed the policies and processes in force at the

   time. I would add that it is likely I was involved to some degree in reviews of

   relevant policies and processes but I am unable to recall specific reviews or

   level of involvement.



64.1 have been asked a number of questions relating to the suspension of

   subpostmasters and the termination of subpostmasters contracts. I was asked

   to consider a number of documents as part of the response, however the vast

   majority of these documents were dated after December 2010 or were undated

   and from information contained in the undated document it was clear they

   were dated post December 2010. My responses are therefore based on my

                                                                                 WITNO9010100




   own recollection and the following documents: [POL00084993],

   [P0L00089004], [P0L00084002], [P0L00005856], and [NFSP00000511]



65. 1 have been asked a number of questions about the Contract Manager role in

   relation to discrepancies or shortfalls discovered at audit and about the

   process followed by them. If a discrepancy or shortfall above a specified level

   was discovered at audit the auditor would contact the Contract Manager to

   advise them of the outcome of the audit and inform them of their findings

   including any comments made by the subpostmaster in relation to the

   discrepancy / shortfall. If the audit had been specifically requested by another

   POL team they may also have information from that team about the reason for

   the audit. The Contract Manager would fully question the auditor to ascertain

   all known facts before making their decision in respect of next steps. They

   could consult with a more experienced colleague or their line manager if they

   felt they required further guidance. The Contracts Manager had the authority

   and was responsible for making the decision related to next steps and he / she

   would advise the auditor of that decision. If the decision was to suspend the

   subpostmaster my recollection is that the Contract Manager would either

   speak to the subpostmaster to advise them that they were being suspended,

   the reasons for the suspension and discuss what would happen next in respect

   of the branch and their contract or if for some reason that wasn't possible then

   the auditor would be asked to convey the same information. The Contract

   Manager would then take steps to maintain service by appointing a temporary

   subpostmaster to run the branch (the appointment of a temporary

   subpostmaster would be on the basis that the current subpostmaster was



                                 Page 21 of 28
                                                                                     WITNO9010100
                                                                                   WITNO9010100




   prepared to let a temporary subpostmaster operate the branch from their

   premises). The Contract Manager would then follow the conduct process to its

   conclusion which would either result in the re-instatement of the

   subpostmaster or the termination of his/her contract.



66. In terms of whether a subpostmaster had the opportunity to make

   representations about the decision to suspend them then they could do so by

   speaking to the Contract Manager and, if they felt it appropriate, they could

   make representations to more senior managers in the Network Directorate.



67. My recollection is that a subpostmaster was not remunerated during their

   period of suspension. If a temporary subpostmaster was appointed they could

   negotiate a payment with the temporary subpostmaster for use of their

   premises.



68. Contract Managers made the decision to terminate a subpostmaster's contract

   after a full investigation and an interview where the subpostmaster could make

   personal representation and could be accompanied by an NFSP

   representative or a colleague at that meeting who could also make

   representations / provide information on their behalf.



69. If the decision was made not to terminate a subpostmaster's contract after a

   period of suspension the subpostmaster would be re-instated.

                                                                                 WITNO9010100




70. My recollection is that subpostmasters who had been suspended because of

   cash shortages and whose contract was subsequently terminated were

   summarily terminated without notice.



71. 1 have been asked about whether subpostmasters had the right of appeal

   against the decision to suspend them. The suspension was precautionary to

   enable a full investigation to take place and to my knowledge a subpostmaster

   did not have a right of appeal against the decision to suspend them.



72. 1 have been asked about whether subpostmasters had the right of appeal

   against the decision to terminate their contract and about the process. All

   subpostmasters whose contracts were terminated either with or without notice

   had the opportunity to appeal that decision. The subpostmaster had a period

   of time in which to lodge an appeal and then the appeal was allocated to a

   member of the appeals panel who would have been a senior manager trained

   to handle appeals.



73. The individual had all the previous investigation information used to make the

   decision and any new information they requested. The role of the manager

   allocated to hear the appeal was to investigate and rehear the case. It was

   usual for a subpostmaster to attend an appeal meeting and for them to be

   accompanied at that meeting by an NFSP representative or a colleague. At

   that meeting the subpostmaster had every opportunity to put forward reasons

   why their contract should not be terminated and the person accompanying

   them could also make representations on their behalf. The appeals manager

                                                                                   WITNO9010100
                                                                                 WITN09010100




   could request additional information if they felt that would be helpful in making

   their decision on whether or not to uphold the appeal. The appeal manager

   would ensure they had fully reviewed all of the evidence plus information

   provided by the subpostmaster and their representative before making their

   decision.



74. 1 have been asked to explain about changes made as a result of the Network

   Transformation Programme. I can confirm that the programme introduced the

   concept of Core and Outreach and that a number of branches were closed as

   part of the programme, however, I am unable to recall other changes made as

   a result of the programme.



75. The appeal decision was final; however, a subpostmaster could always contact

   the Network Director or the Chief Executive if they wished to do so. Whilst this

   was not a formal part of the appeal process that avenue was always open to

   any subpostmaster.



76.1 have been asked about my role in reviewing policies and guidance applicable

   to suspensions, terminations and the appeals process. I cannot recall a

   specific role I had in reviewing any of these processes; however I may have

   been asked to comment on proposed changes to one or more of these

   processes.

Knowledge of bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon system

77. I have been asked whether I was aware of a trend of increasing debt and

   average audit loss and whilst I am unable to recall being aware of such a trend

   I note from [POL00107129] that year on year from April 2007 to June 2010 the

   percentage of agents suspended and audit shortages to audits completed was

   declining .



78. 1 have been asked if I had, or was aware of, any concerns relating to the

   robustness of the Horizon system during the time I worked for POL. I can

   confirm that from my perspective, as an operational manager, I did not have

   concerns about any aspect of the Horizon system in terms of its operation,

   accuracy or integrity. I am aware that there were a small number of

   challenges around the integrity and accuracy of the system, however, there

   were assurances being given from within the business that the system was

   robust. I note from document [POL00105565] that I was asked to provide

   information to enable the business to consider a response to a Channel 4

   programme. I assume with input from my team that I would have provided the

   information requested but cannot recall the programme or whether the

   business provided a response to the programme. I have also read Rod Ismay's

   report at [POL107129] and from information in this report I can see that at

   Appendix 3 there is a report from Fujitsu that covers a number of points related

   to Horizon data integrity and describes failure scenarios and measures in

   place to ensure data integrity in each scenario. I had no reason to consider

   that the assurances being given by the business were not accurate and I
