No —I think it is because I have zero software on my PO laptop - is it a visio file?

Patrick,

As discussed, the BAU investigation process is very complicated.

There are several different types of investigation that POL could carry out: security / criminal, contract management,
FSC for financial losses, NBSC call, field support / training, etc.). We tried once to draw up a process map for this —
see attached (though I can't recall that this ever got verified as accurate). In my experience, I'm not convinced that this
process is followed in practice and I suspect that investigations are a bit more ad hoc.

In short, there isn't something that looks like a typical BAU investigation. To my mind, there are probably three key
investigation areas that can run in parallel or overlap:

FSC investigations into financial discrepancies — this is quite a wide umbrella that catches lots of different issues.

Security investigations into criminal activity.

Contract management investigations that proceed suspension / termination.

In relation to Scheme investigations, these were conducted by Angela's team. We had a training day for the
investigators and I think that Angela may have done a presentation on how to investigate cases. I did a slot on report
writing (presentation attached). I'm not aware of the details of how Angela's team did their investigations.

After Angela's team did the initial investigation, BD then became involved in tightening up the reports and asking
sensible questions to make the reports accurate. The reports then went through a long sign off process:

e Report drafted by investigator > BD lawyer > me > Angela > CK > POL legal (mainly Jonny Gribben) >
Angela > report released to SS

For the first few reports, BD also did an "issues analysis" where we reviewed the CQR and drew up a list of key issues
and questions. This then acted as a guide for POL's investigators. After a while, the investigators got better at doing
this themselves so BD stopped doing this analysis.

Sorry that I'm not much help. If! can help with anything, please let me know.

Hi Both

Just an element of precision: we need two things:

Anatomy of a BAU investigation

Anatomy of investigation under the Scheme

Obviously, when cases came into the Scheme, they will have had the first of these and then a Scheme
investigation was undertaken but those investigations were distinct exercises, and we need details of both.

Hi Andy,

Hope you had a nice weekend. As part of the TP Review we need to be able to provide ASAP to the QC
(Jonathan Swift):

An anatomy of a ‘typical BAU investigation’ undertaken as part of the Scheme (and subsequent to any
original investigation that may have taken place at the time of, for example, a contract termination). I realise
no two cases are the same, but looking at the POIRs I see there is a checklist of documents that each
investigation would look at. So my questions are:

o Can you remember if any words were ever written at the Scheme’s birth, detailing the ‘what,
how , where & why’ to each investigation? And if any associated process map exists? If so
can you please forward on. If not:

= Who do you think would be best placed to write them (Shirley? Jonny Gribben?)

Happy to talk through if it helps?
