1. INTRODUCTION

This document, the Known Problem Register (KPR), records those
known problems which are not intended to be resolved by means of
product change in the target Release.

It provides visibility of such problems for evaluation of the business
risk to DSS/POCL and/or Pathway of their presence in the target
Release, for developing suitable risk containment measures and for
tracking a problem’s subsequent resolution.

It is anticipated that most problems of this kind will originate from
PinlCLs raised and reviewed during the later phases of systems
testing. Such PinlCLs are categorised by the Pathway PinICL Impact
Assessment Team (PIAT) to distinguish whether a fix by way of
product change is required in the target Release, or whether, in the
light of the attendant business risks, it is reasonable to defer such
fixes.

Fixes for certain problems of a minor or cosmetic nature will be listed
in this KPR. This is for “supply side” reasons: as a generality it is
advisable not to open up modules unnecessarily both to avoid the
possibility of introducing instability and because resources should be
concentrated on essential fixes as a release date approaches.

Some problems will originate from the operation of DSS and POCL
systems although at present these are not directly visible to Pathway.

The PIAT membership is drawn from Customer Requirements with
access to Quality, Security, Development and Test.

The KPR records the PinICL Call or other Reference; the problem, its
effects and any possible circumventions at a level of description that is
accessible to business analysis; and an assessment of the business
impacts on the parties.
