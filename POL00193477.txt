Subject: review of second sight investigation
Malcolm

I understand that there may be a review of the second sight investigation.

If this is the case, I want you to know that even though I am leaving the company I would like my views to be heard on
how events unfolded and how the investigation progressed as I have been close to the investigation since its
inception, and been working with SS on a day to day basis for the last 12 months.

After 22° August I can be reached via email:

Regards, Simon
