3 Overview of the Interface

3.1 Data Description

The following messages are exchanged over the NBX - LINK interface:

NBX Description Direction
Message Id

[R3] Authorisation / Financial Transaction Request: NBX > LINK

e balance enquiry (0100)
e withdrawal (0200)
e deposit (0200)

Note: there is no separate message to LINK for
withdrawal with balance. LINK will always return
the balance to NBX if sent by the issuer.

[A1] Authorisation/Financial Transaction Request LINK > NBX
Response:

* balance enquiry response (0110)
e withdrawal response (0210)
e deposit response (0210)

Each of the above will have a response code
that indicates approve or decline with reason
and any required action (e.g. card retention).

[E1] Reversal Request: NBX > LINK
* reversal (0420)
*° reversal repeat (0421)

Please note that the number of times the 0421
message is sent is configurable within the NBX,
up to a maximum of 9,999 times.

3.2 Derivation and Use of Data

The messages listed above are generally exchanged as a result of a transaction initiated either by a clerk at a
Post Office outlet or by LINK. The NBX acts as a message router, filtering messages based on business rules
and transforming received messages into the appropriate format for forwarding to the next system in the
message sequence.

The following table shows the derivation and use of each message exchanged between the NBX and LINK in
terms of the received message that causes each NBX - LINK message to be exchanged, and the transmitted
message resulting from the NBX - LINK message exchange:

Message Sequence
Horizon Horizon NBX LINK
Outlet Campus
[Ri] > [R2] > 0100/0200
[R3]>
< [A3] < [A2] =
0110/0210
{A1]
[Co] > [C2] > 0420/0424
[E1]>
< 0430
{E2]

The messages exchanged over this interface relating to end of day, reconciliation and settlement are initiated
by LINK, and are neither derived from received messages nor used to generate onward messages.

Security key exchange messages are initiated by LINK or NBX and acknowledged by the other party. Either
LINK may send a new AWK or NBX may request that LINK sends a new AWK. After a Logon initiated by
either party LINK will send a new AWK. The connection type is Acquirer only. The following table shows the
derivation and use of each security message exchanged between LINK and the NBX. See Ref. [7].

Other 0800 messages may be initiated by either LINK or NBX (with the exception of the End of Day message,
which is LINK initiated), and are acknowledged by a 0810 response from the other side.

The use of Handshakes is described in the NBX — LINK Technical Interface Specification (Ref. [4]).

All 0100 and 0200 messages sent out by NBX prior to sending the 0810 approved key change will have used
the current AWK to encrypt the PIN Block. As soon as the 0810 approved response is transmitted, the new
AWK becomes active so that all messages generated after its receipt use the new AWK to encrypt the PIN
Block.

In the event that the Key Check Value received by NBX (with the AWK in the 0800 Key Change message)
does not match the one created when testing the new AWK, NBX will return a 0810 denied response. Under
these circumstances the new AWK will NOT be implemented and any subsequent transactions will continue to
have the PIN Block encrypted using the current AWK.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

When a new AWK is sent, LINK sets a timer flag which inhibits further key exchanges. This flag is unset
enabling further key exchanges, after a configurable period (currently 2 minutes), if a key exchange is not
received.

3.3 Non Computer Data

All data being transported across this interface is originated/received from a connected computer system or
from reference data (supplied by the Post Office Limited RDS or held internally within the NBX).

3.4 Clarifications to LINK Standard

Point of Service Condition Code (Bitmap Reference 025) will initially be set to value 54 (Non ICC Capable
Branch ATM). Value 55 will be used to indicate ICC Capable Branch ATM when chip read support added.

Transaction Amounts are likely to contain pence - they will not be rounded to whole pounds or ten’s of
pounds.

4 Data Items

4.1 Data Item List

4.1.1. General Message Element Definitions and Abbreviations

The following section summarises the list of LINK Message Elements for each group of transactions, together
with which message(s) they are present in. Each message is classified and identified using the RAC (Request
/ Authorise / Confirm) model. Each message element references the corresponding ISO 8583 bitmap position.

The ISO 8583 bit map reference has been included for ease of reference.

The abbreviations used to describe the format of each data element (DE) and Data Sub-elements are shown
in the following table (taken from the LINK Switch Service Interchange Standard (LIS5), (Ref. [1]):

Notatio I Explanation
n
a Alphabetic characters only (upper case)
n Numeric Digits only
Ss Special characters
an Alphabetic (upper case) or Numeric characters
as Alphabetic (upper case) or Special characters
ns Numeric or Special characters
ans, Alphabetic (upper case), Numeric or Special characters only
DD Day
MM. Month
YY Year
hh Hour
mm Minutes
ss Seconds
LL Length of variable field that follows represented using two characters
LLL Length of variable field that follows represented using three characters
VAR Variable length field
3 Fixed length field (e.g. 3 characters in this example)
70 Variable length field (e.g. up to a maximum of 10 characters in this example). LL
or LLL to indicate the actual length of the field will prefix all variable length fields.
h hexadecimal representation of the data
Zz tracks 2 and 3 data as defined by ISO 7811 and ISO 7813

The Field Size column gives the number of characters (octets) required for the data item, as shown in the
table below.

Abbreviation I Description
3 Fixed Length field. Numeric fixed length fields are right justified and zero
padded. Fixed length string fields are left justified and space padded.
10 Variable length field (up to a maximum of 10 characters in this example).

Notes:
e Fixed length numeric fields are unpacked, right justified and zero filled.
e Fixed length alphanumeric fields are left justified and space filled.

The “Required” column indicates whether the field is Mandatory or Conditional for the messages defined in this
AIS. For conditional fields, the field description should indicate under what circumstances the data for the field
should be populated or omitted from the message.

The “Description” column contains a brief description of the field, as used in the messages defined in this AIS
together with any additional comments.

The LINK and NBX Servers both use the ASCII English character set (CCSID = 437).

4.1.2. Messages Data Elements

The LISS Data Elements exchanged within messages over this interface are listed below. A fuller description is given in the LINK Switch Service
Interchange Standard (LIS5), (Ref. [1]). The ICC data elements are represented from the 3° bitmap on this interface.

A greyed out row in the following tables means that the field is not required and may not be populated in messages from NBX to LINK. The NBX will log
any such fields received from LINK but will not process them further.

4.2 Data Interpretations

This section contains the definition of each message type to be sent over this interface. The Message
Element column lists those elements required for the message by Horizon name, and relates to list in Section
4.1.

The Required column in the message definition tables within this section contain the following codes:

Code Meaning

M The element is mandatory and must be present in this message

c The element is conditional for this message, and the condition to be applied is
stated in the Conditions column. If the condition is true, the element must be
present in the message, otherwise the element must not be present in the
message. It should be noted that the receiving system may not be able to
assess whether the condition has been met, in which case it must be able to
interpret the presence or non-presence of the element according to appropriate
business rules.

fe} Optional (see Message Definitions below for specific rules)

The Conditions column lists the conditions for inclusion of a conditional message element; inclusion of the
element may depend on details of the transaction type, or simply whether the data is available to the sending
system.

The message definitions given in the sections below do not include bitmaps. Primary, secondary and tertiary
bitmaps will be used as required by the LINK Switch Service Interchange Standard (LISS), (Ref. [1]).

It is essential that developers of this interface also refer to the LINK Switch Service Interchange Standard
(LISS), (Ref. [1]) and the Horizon - LINK Mapping document, (Ref. [5] for further details of data derivation and
use. The message definitions do not explicitly show the bitmaps as individual message elements, because
they are an essential part of the LISS transfer structure. However, all messages passed over this interface will
include bitmap 1, and all except [R3] will also include bitmap 2. Bitmap 3 is used for the ICC data elements
over this interface.

A greyed out row in the following tables means that the field is not required and may not be populated in
messages from NBX to LINK. The NBX will log any such fields received from LINK but will not process them
further.

4.2.7 [E1] - Reversal Request
4.2.7.1 Overview
This message is sent by the NBX to LINK when a financial transaction that has been processed by the
issuer needs to be reversed.
The [E1] message maps to the following LINK messages:
* 0420 - Reversal Request
e 0421 - Reversal Repeat.
A Reversal Request [E1] can only be generated when the [A1] message to be reversed can be mapped
against a [R3] request.
Reversal Requests may be sent up to a (configurable) period, initially set to 5 days, after the original
transaction to which it refers.
Note that partial reversals are not supported over this interface.

5 Transfer Structure

5.1 Transfer Grouping

The following figure shows the end to end message sequences, using the RACE (Request / Authorise /
Confirm / Exception) model, for all application messages between the NBX and the LINK Switch. No
knowledge is assumed of the interface between LINK and its member financial institutions.

Figure 1 - LINK Message Flows in the Network Banking Environment

A 0620 message may be issued by the NBX in response to all messages from LINK (for simplicity, only one
such flow is shown on the diagram).

Reversals (0420 messages) are not sent from NBX to LINK unless and until an approved response (0210
message) has been received from LINK. Repeat Reversals (0421) are only sent in the event that the prior
0420 (or 0421) reversal messages have not had a response processed at the NBX.

FUJ00003483

NBX — LINK Application Project: EMV — Banking and Retail
Interface Specification (AIS)
P (AIS) Doc Ret: NB/IFS/024
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

Each incoming request is time-stamped as it is received by LINK. The settlement day in which the transaction
will be processed will depend on whether the transaction was time-stamped before or after LINK transmitted
the 0800 cut-over message (irrespective of whether a subsequent 0810 message was received).

The interface should be resilient to the transfer of duplicate messages; in practice, however, this should only
happen after failure and recovery of either end of the interface.

LINK will not validate transmission date and time in messages against the date and time that messages are
received.

The interface details are also described in the NBX — LINK Technical Interface Specification (Ref. [4])

5.2 Transfer Structure

The messages defined in this AIS will be exchanged in accordance with Section 3 of the LINK Switch Service
Interchange Standard (LIS5), (Ref. [1]), which describes the use of Message Type Identifier, Bit Map and Data
Elements in the message structure. Note that the messages exchanged over this interface use the third bit
map for the ICC data elements.

Messages for one transaction may be interleaved with messages for any other transaction.

5.3 Record Structure

The record structure for the messages defined in this AIS is as described in the LISS Interchange Standard,
Reference (Ref. [1]). The details are not repeated here.

The record structure for the LREC file passed over this interface is described in LINK Reconciliation File
Specification (LREC) Standard Format, (Ref. [2]). The details are not repeated here.

5.4 Sequences

Figure 1 above (see Section 5.1) shows the end to end message sequences of all the messages supported by
this AIS, from the PO Outlet to the issuing financial institution. Further detail relating specifically to the NBX -
LINK connection can be found in the NBX — LINK Technical Interface Specification (Ref. [4]). The interface
must be resilient to the disconnection or loss of any part of the total network banking environment for short or
extended periods.

5.5 Data Volumes

Data Rates and Volumes over this interface are addressed through the NB Volume Model Comparisons, (Ref.
(3]).

5.6 Data Authentication

For this implementation, Message Authentication Codes (MACs) will not be included in the messages sent
between the NBX and LINK.

5.7 Data Dictionary

The Data Elements used on this interface are defined and described within Appendix G of the LINK Switch
Service Interchange Standard (LISS), (Ref. [1]).

6 Security of Transmitted Data

The security standards for the LINK-NBX interface are described in the NBX — LINK Technical Interface
Specification (Ref. [4]).

6.1 Protected Data

PIN blocks that pass across the interface from NBX to LINK are encrypted under an Acquirer Working Key
(AWK). This key is used in the LINK — NBX shared security zone. PIN Block encryption is translated from

internal keys to protection under this shared key using a hardware encryption module. The PIN blocks are

never rendered in clear outside the hardware module.

Acquirer Working Keys are exchanged electronically under a Acquirer Zone Master Key (AZMK) shared
between NBX and LINK. The AZMK is generated and owned by the NBX. The AWK is owned and generated
by LINK.

6.2 Encryption and Decryption Methods

PIN Block and Acquirer Working Key transmission is protected by Triple DES double length keys, 112bit plus
key check data.

All data transmitted on communication lines between the NBX and LINK is encrypted using Line Encryption
Units. LINK is responsible for the Line Encryption Units at both ends of the communication line.

6.3 Session Establishment

Sessions Establishment can be initiated by LINK or NBX. Initial Logon messages exchanges are followed by
transmission by LINK to NBX of a new AWK with a key check value protected by encryption under the shared
current AZMK.

NBX verifies the key and acknowledges it to LINK. All PIN Block data is protected by this AWK until the
session ends or the AWK is renewed.

6.4 Key Management

Key ownership is described in section 5.4 of the NBX — LINK Technical Interface Specification (Ref. [4]). LINK -
NBX Zone Management Keys are managed by the Horizon Key Management Application (KMA) with manual
processes.
According to local manual processes the NBX staff will:
e Generate three new AZMK components
e Transfer the AZMK components onto secure stationery
e Key components will contain
e Akey identifier (visible)
e Akey generation date (visible)
« Acomponent number (visible)
e 32 hex characters in eight groups of four characters — component plus check data (hidden)

e Provide a Key Manager Key Check value
e Load the keys into the Horizon KMA

The Horizon KMA:

e Activates keys for use by Horizon Agents, which manage the TCP/IP connections to LINK.
Keys component documents must be stored and transported separately and securely.

The LINK — NBX AZMK is renewed every six months by this manual procedure. The AZMK, having been
produced as described above, is securely transported, manually, to LINK. It is expected that the resulting
online key verification message sequence would be preceded by telephone co-ordination. If this online key
verification procedure is successful, it is followed by the manual promotion of the AZMK, where the Next
AZMK becomes the Current AZMK. It is recommended that after promotion of the keys, an Operator issue a
command to drive an AWK Key change request sequence, in order to test that the verified AZMK has been
promoted by both parties.

LINK requires more than one Processor Interface (PI) to support the transaction throughput for the NBX. For
this configuration each PI will be configured to support one TCP/IP socket connection. A logical session will
be initiated by a logon, and data for that session will flow over the socket connection belonging to that Pl (see
Ref. [5] for further details). Each PI generates a LINK-NBX Acquirer Working Key (AWK) which it sends to
NBX for validation. This AWK, if validated by the NBX, is used by both socket connections between NBX and
the PI that generated it. Logical sessions for a different PI will use the AWK generated by that PI. All LINK
Pls will protect their AWK in transit to NBX by encryption using the same AZMK, during its six months of
currency.

The AWKs are changed under the following conditions (note that it is not necessary to change the AWKs as
soon as the AZMK is changed).

«Every 24 hours where the session remains active (an AWK may be changed at a set (configurable) clock
time and will remain valid until it is changed)

e  Atsession initiation by either party
e On receipt by LINK of a 6" consecutive invalid PIN block on a session
e When either a NBX or LINK operator requests a key change.

Load balancing between the Pls will be performed by the NBX ensuring that the appropriate AWK for the PI is
used for PIN block translation.

There may be a short outage at the FI (typically up to 90 seconds) while the manual process for changing the
AZMK is under way.

7 Operational Procedures

7.1 Processing Cycles

This interface relates to online message exchange to support real time financial transactions, and to the daily
transmission from LINK of the LREC file.

A transaction, which is subsequently discarded, must be logged after receipt, prior to being discarded

7.2 Transfer Initiation

All transfers defined in this AIS are automatic.

7.3 Security Procedures

Manual Procedures are required to support the above key management protocol, as described in Section 6
above.

7.4 Fallback Procedures
Fallback procedures are described in the NBX — LINK Technical Interface Specification (Ref. [4]).

Each system is responsible for its own recovery after failure. Restoration of the interface and the disposal of
stale messages (other than “must deliver” messages) is expected to be automatic. 0100, 0200, 0110 and 0210
({R] and [A]), 0620 and 0800 messages awaiting transmission at the time of failure can safely be discarded, as
the integrity of the transaction is protected by timeouts.

The only messages categorised as “must deliver” are Network Management (0800) and Reversal Request
(0420/0421) messages - see Section 6 of the LINK Switch Service Interchange Standard (LIS5), (Ref. [1]).
Sign On, Sign Off, Key Change, Key Change Request and Online Key Verification 0800 messages are “must
deliver” but do not have to survive across processes when moving from active to standby sites.

Handshake 0800 messages are sent every few minutes anyway (which is sufficient).
End of Day 0800 messages are “must deliver” but note that LINK will send the message just once. Whether or
not LINK receives a response, LINK will cut over to the next Settlement Day and create LREC files

accordingly. LINK will not send another End of Day message on a PI for which no response was received.

Reversal Request 0420/0421 messages are “must deliver” messages and do have to survive when moving
from active to standby sites.

7.5 Downgrade Transactions

A ‘Downgrade’ transaction is one where an IC Card has been used at an ICC enabled terminal, but the card
issuer has advised, via POL reference data (dependent upon IIN), that the card must not be processed as ICC.
The on-line message will be formatted as a standard magnetic stripe transaction.

Nothing, apart from the Track 2 Service Code in the on-line LISS Message sent to LINK, will indicate that an
IC Card was used.

Interface Specification (AIS) Doc Ref: NB/IFS/024

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

Note that in the case of a Downgrade transaction, data must not be used from the IC, but that normal
procedures must be followed as for magnetic stripe cards.

7.6 Control

The interface must be resilient to duplicate messages, which may occur after recovery of any element in the
system, but are not otherwise expected to occur.

Lost or discarded messages are handled by timeout processing at every stage of the message sequence, to
ensure that incomplete transactions are declined if unauthorised or reversed if authorised.

The NBX will log events affecting this interface (e.g. response indicating receipt by LINK of an invalid PIN
block) to an Event Log. These events will be managed by Tivoli for escalation to the relevant Help Desk, as
appropriate to the code associated with the event.
