The Plan encompasses an extensive set of initiatives across six core pillars of activity (Proposition, Network, Postmaster/SP relations,
Operating Model, Technology/Data, Other considerations)

The Strategic Plan will transform Post Office's operations, finances, relationship with PMs and customer experience, delivering a
viable business model and proactive steps to counter challenges Post Office is facing, alongside positive steps to address market shifts
The Plan is sequenced across three phases, with delivery of a sustainable Post Office largely complete by Year 4

Initiatives in the Strategic Plan deliver change across both the top-line (+£112m) and cost elements (-£178m); the net impact enables

The Situation Assessment determined that Post Office is at a critical

juncture and faces multiple challenges

Summary of key areas of challenges faced by POL

Shareholder relationship: Opportunity to reset by
providing a strategic plan with transparency around
long-term investment required and future financially
independent state this would achieve

Technology strategy: NBIT involves high risk ‘big
band’ deployment with uncertain but high expected
costs; critical juncture to consider alternatives. Limited
focus on transformational in-store technology

Central operations: Comprehensive review required
to simplify the organisation, reduce costs, structure
operations and instigate cultural change to foster clear-
sighted ambition and better support the Post Office of
the future

Postmasters: Evident need to reconsider current
remuneration model, further professionalise franchisee
model and take material steps to redress PO/PM
relationships

Sources: POL input; Teneo research & analysis

Purpose: Unclear ‘purpose’ to date has hampered
clear direction - critical for PO to develop a strategy
that all stakeholders can align on (& opportunity for PO
leadership to drive this)

Brand: Under pressure from the Horizon IT scandal
and Inquiry. Whilst damaging, brand trust has been
relatively resilient — nevertheless, vital to work to
rebuild trust; good brand awareness but close
Key areas of association with Mails/passports anchor ‘right to play’;
many customers unaware of PO’s diverse product set
challenge faced by
= Customers: Falling retail customer volumes. PO
the Post Office needs to enhance its digital offering to draw customers

to branches and better use automation to improve in-
branch customer experience

Commercial portfolio: Growing headwinds in core
Mails/Retail; while BF4 will help to partially offset, this
is unlikely to be a long-term solution and there are
likely no ‘big bang’ new products that could be
immediately rolled out

Network: Current branch number requirements are outdated for
@ current customer behaviours and driving an inefficient network,
leading to a significant number of unprofitable branches
