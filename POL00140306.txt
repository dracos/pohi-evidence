Dear Tony,

This email deals with the document points in your email below.

The OCPs and OCRs are attached. I have copied in Lucy and Jane who will advise whether or not they are in the
bundle/add them if not, but the general rule is that all documents referred to in a witness statement or expert report are
in the bundle plus any others that have been added by either party.

There are multiple versions of the TIP Transaction Repair User Guide (PI/MAN/001):

The issue in the remote access note relates to 2009/2010, so I attach v1.4 which based on the document dates was
the current version in 2009/2010 and also v2 which is the most recent version of the document.

Let me know if you want to discuss.

Kind regards
Jonny

Subject: Remote access queries

Dear Andy,
T’ve gone through the Legacy Horizon parts of your remote access notes and have the following queries on those parts:

1. Your comments on Coyne 2 paras 3.234-242, 3.247-248 and 3.249-265 have questions for Fujitsu which have
not been answered. Also 5.423. se questions need to be answered quickly!

2.
b. In 3.224-231, it is said that a configuration object was changed. What was the change, precisely? Given
that the stock numbers in the branch accounts changed, why isn't it every bit as objectionable on Cs’ case as
a transaction data change? Could it not result in a false figure being inserted?

3.

3. Paras 3.247-248:

a. Does the TIP
be?
4. Paras 3.249-262:

¢ say anything helpful? Is it in the trial bundles? Should it

a. What was actually proposed here? Which counters would have been deleted and which counters’ data
would have been replaced?
b. What was the alternative solution that was adopted.
c. Why did the peak say “closing as insufficient evidence”?
d. The peak refers to problems with the OTI. What is the OTI and why would problems with the OTI have
caused the peak to be cloned?

5. Your comment on 5.424 refers to Gareth Jenkins’ comments. Can they please be set out in this note?

The existing transaction data was not changed. Two new transactions were injected:
* One added a stock adjustment of +1p for Romanian Lei

* One added a cash adjustment for -1p.

Dear Andy and Jonny,

I don't know how I missed this, but does para 18 of SP3 mean what I think it means — that Legacy Horizon transaction
injections could be used to change the opening position of stock in a branch’s accounts? If so, why does he say in para
17 that branch accounts data was not modified?

Best wishes,

Tony
