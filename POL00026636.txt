5. Any other queries raised by Applicants / Advisors

« Some Professional Advisors have raised concerns about the timescales & fees set by
the Working Group; they have indicated that they will be putting their concerns in writing
to AH (although no letter has been received to date). Howe & Co have not requested an
extension, but 6 applications are now overdue (with several others nearing the due date).
BC to draft a letter on behalf of the Working Group to all Professional Advisors to explain
the process for requesting an extension setting out that they should disclose reasons
why an extension is required before the deadline has passed. Letter to be sent under
AH's signature.

e Second Sight raised a concern about the adequacy of reports received from Howe & Co
and others (variations in quality and style)

e twas agreed the remit of the Professional Advisor is to present the case, not to
investigate the case. Professional Advisor representing case M087 is misinterpreting the
nature of their role. BC to draft a letter on behalf of the Working Group to this
Professional Advisor to clarify their role; letter to be sent under AH’s signature.

6. Issues with resourcing / timings

7. Late cases note

e BC to draft a letter on behalf of the Working Group (AH to sign-off) to the 3
Subpostmasters requesting further information to support their reasons for wanting to
join the Scheme after the deadline for applications has passed. The Subpostmasters
should respond with their supporting documents that were sent to the wrong solicitors.
