Craig,

I have 10 cases listed on the site at present but the point you make about this being a judgement call in absolutely right
and we either go ‘belt and braces’ on this and every time there is the briefest mention of Horizon being at fault put this on
the spreadsheet or leave it down to a judgement call by the CA/Lin/myself. The danger with the latter is something could
always happen like this.

I have no problem with this being raised as part of AOB next week and I have no problem in either Angela or you having
access to the Sharepoint site.

Regards
John

John. Have a look on site and let me know, what happens with info? We could raise as AOB next week. Really the
criticism I'm getting here is that I wasn't aware of the issue at this branch but unfortunately nor was Lin despite the scale
of losses and and underlying claim in was a systems fault - this has left Lin and I exposed and questioned why Anita
wasn't raising too and I do not want a repeat where it appears after 18month. . Just need to ensure that CA's are raising
all potential high profile cases with you both although I do recognise this can be a judgement call. Craig

I believe my team are recording all potential Horizon issue cases on a Sharepoint site but I don’t flag to Angela each time
an entry is raised — how do we want to play this because Horizon gets raised almost as a throw away comment in some
instances whereas others like the one below may be more serious.

I will have a look at the site and see what is on there.

Lin, John

The whole e-mail trail is not for forward communication but I wanted you to see it as it deals with connectivity.

Angela uis waiting for the detailed history of the case from Anita as previously requested via Lin and was after it by the
end of the week. I’ve just dropped Anita line to see how it is progressing.

I know Lin you told me that because this was not a losses case (she was making good) it hadn’t been flagged up and
although you knew there were issues you were not aware of the scale at £18k!
Going on for 18months without us knowing is a concern as it makes me wonder if there are any others out there?

I know you have both already told all of your CA’s to flag up any Horizon arguments to Angela but perhaps we need a
reminder to yours team from yourselves especially if losses like this are involved — as I said I'd never heard of a
connectivity argument before but for it to arise after 18months and for Anita to have been aware doesn’t look good for
us. Concern now is that this agent thinks she has found £18k!!!
Can you just ensure it is s emphasised how important this is to all of the CA’s

Angel is getting more information re Gareth’s comments but I think the approach and outline you are drawing yup based
on Thorney would have been relevant here as well as the route we follow and I would guess Anita has been following a
similar path but without informing you/us?

Hi Andy,

\ tried ringing you but got through to your voice mail.

In terms of how this is now being progressed, I've raised an internal call which our 3"! line support unit (SSC) is looking
at.

For further updates, I suggest you contact the Manger of the SSC who is Steve Parker. I've copied him on this email so
you have his email address for further contacts if necessary.

As I'm writing this, I have just received some initial findings:

1. Acheck has been made for timeouts due to comms errors. There have been a number (which confirms the
finding yesterday about some issues with the comms}, but in the majority of cases the automatic retry works
successfully so this would just appear at the branch as a slow response. This would not result in losses.

2. Acheck has been made as to any possibly losses due to Recovery in the last 6 months (which I did suggest
yesterday was an outside possibility of a problem). There have been 8 potential recovery sessions in the last 6
months all of which indicated no recovery was required. Of these 2 were due to a general issue across the
estate and one resulted in a counter being swapped which is the incident that started this investigation. Again
this indicates nothing to create a loss,

3. At the start of the email trail there was a mention of two different reports showing significantly different cash
levels. investigation shows that these were probably taken around 30 mins apart and that transactions had
taken place in the stock unit in between to account for the cash differences, That Stock Unit had a gain of £170
{as stated below), but the other stock units had large losses.

All this indicates that there is nothing amiss in the system itself, but there are clearly issues in the Branch and perhaps
the way in which they are using the system.

Hi Lesley,

POL-0096509
POLO0096926
POL00096926

We have checked out the comms line and there do seem to be timeouts when trying to contact the counters in the
Branch and so this has been passed over to our engineers to investigate.

However as I said on Friday, this would not directly result in any losses to the Branch.

The only way I can see were there might be an indirect loss is if the Branch connectivity to the Data Centre was so poor
that the Counters were frequently timing out, which results in staff being asked to recover failed transactions as part of
the Recovery Log On. This process is fairly robust, but it does occasionally give staff an opportunity to respond
incorrectly to questions which might possibly result in an error in the accounts (either a loss or a gain). Such manual
recoveries would be pretty obvious to the staff involved and it would be pretty obvious that a potential problem has
occurred. It is highly unlikely that this would result in the losses that the branch appear to be having.

I've passed a request onto our 3“ line support team to investigate to see if there is any evidence of excessive Forced Log
out and consequential recovery taking place in this Branch. This will now be progressed using the normal support
processes.

Gareth

Angela,

In simple terms, Horizon attempts to store a complete basket of a customer's transactions to the Data
Centre in one comms interaction (which may get broken down into a number of separate packets). This
should be either fully processed or entirely lost. There is a digital signature on the whole basket
{included in the same interaction) to ensure that the data has not been corrupted en route. if the entire
transaction is lost, then there are retries and if these fail the user is made aware of the problem and is
logged out, so I am very sceptical as to whether comms issues can be the cause of the loss.

if required, we can try and help you further in investigating exactly what has been going on in this
Branch.

Could you take a look at the attached emails; as you will see, the matter is sensitive.

I have a very clear view on Lesley’s question regarding the possibility of a network fault causing
such discrepancies over such a long period; however, you have far more knowledge and

Can you please help with this issue - it is obviously quite sensitive.
The branch has had issues over a period of months and the engineer has just found a fault on the
line. We would like a view on whether or not this type of fault would cause an issue of this

nature - as you will see from the email that this is to the tune of 18k.

Angela is leading the investigation from Post Office and I would be grateful if one of your team
could contact her directly.

I realise that this is probably outside of the usual process but there is a nervousness around this
one and the fact that the branch now believe that the cause has been found.

Andy: Ihave copied you in with my absence next week and Simons. Simon will pick up when
he's back.

I have not (to my knowledge) been made aware of this branch previously and their
ongoing claims that discrepancies incurred were as a result of the Horizon system. The
content of the e-mail chain below has the potential to set the hares running before we
properly understand what has gone on here and what the potential consequences are.
Therefore can I have as a matter of urgency the background on this branch, including the

and all associated correspondence. I will flag this to the JFSA working group and in
particular raise with Lesley Sewell in relation to the Horizon system.

Hi

This branch has been reporting losses for approximately 18 months and has
always claimed it was due to the Horizon system.

Today John Seymore, a Fujitsu Engineer, visited the branch today and found a
problem with the Broadband which meant it was on a continuous loop.

POL-0096509
When I spoke to him he explained that this could be caused by the ADSL plate
and/or cable which he replaced or the Paystation. He also said that this could
mean that transactions are not going through the system properly.

Please could you look into this case for me. I need to know what the impact of
this fault is and whether it would generate losses in the branch.

If these losses are found to be due to this fault, what would the position be
regarding reimbursing the problem.

Hi Anita - I rang the PM, Jane, at Semilong PO this morning just as an
engineer had arrived at her branch. She explained that she has had an
ongoing problem with discrepancies at her branch for the last 18 months
and you were aware of the situation. She said yesterday on Position 3
there was less than £1000 working cash. The clerk did a balance
snapshot and was £170 over - she immediately did a printout and it was
then showing as £700 under. So she knows there is a fault on the Horizon
system. I agreed I would ring her back at 1.00pm to see what the
engineer had found out.

I have just rang Jane back and she was so happy she said she could cry
with relief. The engineer said there is a definite fault on the line - there was
a bad noise on the line and this was probably causing a ‘loop’ - he said it
may be caused by her Paystation. He has changed the faceplate and the
ADCL cable and is hoping this solves the problem. Horizon Team will now
keep an eye on it and may ring her to tell her to disconnect her Paystation
and then send her a new one.
