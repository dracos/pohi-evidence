Martin,

I attach a briefing note prepared to notify our Director & Officer and Professional Indemnity Liability insurers of the SS
/ Horizon issues.

Can you please let me know if you have any comments on this from a criminal law perspective, bearing in mind that it
may ultimately be publically disclosable (e.g. under the Freedom of Informaiton Act) notwithstanding any claim to
privilege.

Happy to discuss, Rodric
