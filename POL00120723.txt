Having considered the requests for further disclosure as set out in Mr Turner’s report, the

Further to my previous statement 19 November 2012.

After a number of meetings between Post Office Management and Members of
Parliament in relation to the Court cases, it was agreed that the Post Office would
undertake an external review of the cases which had been raised by the Member's
constituents. As the Post Office continues to have absolute confidence in the
robustness and integrity of its Horizon system and it branch accounting processes, it
had no hesitation in agreeing to an external review of these few individual cases.

In order to provide assurance to the interested parties, it was proposed that the review
by undertaken by independent Auditors 2" Sight. The review will be specifically
restricted to the cases raised by the MPs as well as reviewing the accounting
procedures, processes and reconciliations undertaken in relation to the cases in
question. Before formal instructions are given to the Independent Auditors, agreements
will be sought from all interested parties, namely the Members of Parliament and Justice
for Sub postmasters. The Sub postmasters have requested a Forensic Accountant of
their choice be appointed to oversee the Cases being reviewed by 2" Sight.

All the above is accepted based on the terms of the Review being carried out, but this is
in no way an acknowledgement by the Post Office that there is an issue with Horizon.
Over the past ten years many millions of branch reconciliations have been carried out
with transactions and balances accurately recorded by more than 25,000 different sub

Further to my previous statements dated 19" November 2012 and 20" November 2012.
I can confirm from Post Office Ltd Human Resources records that Kym WYLLIE was

appointed sub postmaster of Winlatoni~

GRO!on 8 February 2003.

Sub postmasters are contracted to provide services to customers. As such they receive
a monthly remuneration commensurate with the level of business conducted at the
branch and are provided with a balance of cash and stock to allow them to provide
these services.

All transactions conducted by the sub postmaster are recorded on a computer based
accounting system known as Horizon, which is used in all Post Office branches. The
system records all transactional data inputted by a counter clerk during an accounting
period and provides daily and weekly records enabling counter clerks and sub
postmasters to produce a balance of cash and stock on hand.

At the completion of each Branch Trading Statement if there is a shortage in the
accounts the sub postmaster in accordance with his contract, must make good the
shortage by accepting the shortage on the Horizon system prior to rolling over the cash
and stock into the next Branch Trading Period.

ol
For all shortages of £150 or less the sub postmaster is expected to immediately make
good this shortage by either cash or cheque. For all shortages over £150 he can make
good the loss on the Horizon system by “settling centrally”. By settling centrally the sub
postmaster will pay a sum out of his remuneration each month until the shortage has
been cleared.
Section 12 of the sub postmaster’s contract deals with the Responsibility for Post Office
Stock and Cash.
Sub section 12 and 13 of this contract deal with Losses.
12. The sub postmaster is responsible for all losses caused through his own negligence,
carelessness or error and also for losses of all kinds caused by his assistants.
Deficiencies due to such losses must be made good without delay.
13. The financial responsibility of the Sub postmaster does not cease when he
relinquishes his appointment and he will be required to make good any losses incurred
during his term of office which may subsequently come to light.
Sub section 14 of this contract deals with Gains.
14. Surpluses may be withdrawn provided that any subsequent charge up to the amount
withdrawn is made good immediately.

payments at his sub-office after due allowance has been made for expected receipts and

in accordance with official accounting and security instructions.

The Subpostmaster is expressly forbidden to make use of the balance due to Post Office
Counters Ltd for any purpose other than the requirements of the Post Office service;
and he must, on no account apply to his own private use, for however short a period,
any portion of Post Office Counters Ltd funds entrusted to him. He must also be
careful to keep the Post Office money separate from any other monies. Misuse of Post
Office Counters Ltd cash may render the offender liable to prosecution and, or, the

termination of his Contract of Appointment.

kinds and other Post Office Counters Ltd property, papers and documents, whether
held by himself or by his Assistants, and should keep them in a place of security,

especially at night.

The Subpostmaster is responsible for maintaining a standard of security sufficient to
enable him to meet the obligations laid on him by paragraph 5 for the safe keeping of
Post Office Counters Ltd cash and stock placed in his care. If any circumstances arise
which lead him to doubt whether he can do so he should immediately consult the

Regional General Manager.

In deciding the standard of security which it would be reasonable to require under
paragraph 6 Post Office Counters Ltd will have regard to (a) the circumstances in
which the Subpostmaster was appointed, and in particular the standard of security
then accepted; (b) the length of time since his appointment; and (c) any particular
circumstances affecting the sub-office which appear to be relevant.

All vouchers for payments e.g. Postal Orders, Allowance Dockets etc., should be placed
in a suitable receptacle (cardboard box or strong envelope), labelled “Paid Vouchers”
and at the close of business kept separately from cash and stock in another secure place,

such as a locked drawer or cupboard.

The Subpostmaster must be careful to keep his stocks of all kinds in such a manner that
they remain in good condition. The stocks must be protected against damp and dust.

Datestamps used for authenticating documents (e.g. Postal Orders) or stamping
correspondence must be kept in a position on the counter where they are out of reach

of members of the public. When not needed for work they must be locked away.

Precautions should be taken to guard against the risk of fire.

APPENDIX1

ACCIDENTAL LOSS

If at any time any items of stock (including stock of no intrinsic value such as motor vehicle
licences) is found to be missing. Steps must be taken at once to ascertain what has
happened to the missing items. The serial numbers must be ascertained (see 2(a)) and
verified by examination of items in stock, and the requisition forms examined to
discover whether or not any of the items purport to have been issued out of sequence.
All the requisition forms for the previous 3 months must at the same time be
impounded and held for instructions. If, after careful search, the missing items cannot
be found and are thought to have been mislaid only, or inadvertently destroyed, a
preliminary report of the loss giving the serial numbers of the items in question must be

sent to the Regional General Manager.

STOLEN ITEMS

1. Ifasa result of burglary, break in, theft, or suspected theft any items of stocks are
missing the facts should be reported as quickly as possible to the Regional General

Manager.

2. The further details which will be required, and which should be obtained and
submitted to the Regional General Manager at the earliest opportunity, are as follows:

(a) The denominations, total values and serial numbers of missing or stolen items, so

far as they are known, with serial numbers of any remaining stocks.

(b) Astatement as to whether the date stamp of the sub-office has been stolen, and if
so, particulars of the type in it when stolen. If the date stamp has not been stolen
a statement should be given which should intimate whether there is a reason to

believe that it has been used upon the stolen items.

() A specimen impression of the date stamp and, if it was stolen, particulars of the

type in it when stolen.

POL00120723
POL00120723

(d) A statement of the circumstances which are thought to show that a theft has been
committed and of the supposed date, time and method of commission. It should
include, if possible, written report from the person who last saw the missing
items and the person who first discovered the loss. The former should say when
the items were last seen, in what place and in what kind of receptacle (locked or
unlocked) they then were. The latter should state how and when the loss was
discovered and describe exactly the condition of the place and of the receptacle

from which the items were apparently taken.

(e) Particulars of any cheques, including the transaction for which they were

accepted.
