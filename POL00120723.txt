              Re: Post Office Ltd v. Kim Elizabeth Wylie
              Newcastle Crown Court
              Date of next hearing: 5 March 2013 for trial

              Thank you for your letter date 14th February 2013. Please find enclosed a Notice of
              Additional Evidence which includes two statements from Stephen Bradshaw dated 20
              November 2012 and the 19 February 2013 as well as an exhibit SB/3 which is an extract
              from the Sub Postmaster's contract.

              We note that your expert report was not commissioned until the 28 January 2013, a copy of
              which did not reach us until the 14th February 2013. We also note Mr Turner does not
              comment on the content of our expert report which was served with a Notice of
              Additional Evidence on the 28 November 2012.

              The Crown's position on the integrity of the Horizon system is set out in Steve's
              Bradshaw's statement dated 20 November 2012, '!'here is no further disclosure in relation
              to this matter.


              Having considered the requests for further disclosure as set out in Mr Turner's report, the
              Crown would comment as follows:

                 1.           At the time of the audit in September 2010, the office would have been using
                              Horizon Online and so there would not be any useful evidence contained on the
                              terminal itself. All of the relevant data is recorded on the Horizon system.
                                                                                       POLOO120723
                                                                                     POLOO120723




    2.     Our expert report details the processes and standards that are observed when
          securing/preserving the computer data.

    3.    We have served the call logs received fron the Winlaton PO, please see exhibit
          RD/11 pages 40-55.

In order to assist your expert with viewing the Horizon data, the Officer in the case will
send a CD containing the Horizon data to you within the next few days. Signed and
dated copies of the enclosed statements will also be served alongside the CD.

Should you require any furtherinformation, please do not hesitate to contact Rachael
Panter at the above office on  GRO


Yours faithfully

Further to my previous statement 19 November 2012.
After a number of meetings between Post Office Management and Members of
Parliament in relation to the Court cases, it was agreed that the Post Office would
undertake an external review of the cases which had been raised by the Member's
constituents. As the Post Office continues to have absolute confidence in the
robustness and integrity of its Horizon system and it branch accounting processes, it
had no hesitation in agreeing to an external review of these few individual cases.
In order to provide assurance to the interested parties, it was proposed that the review
by undertaken by independent Auditors 2nd Sight. The review will be specifically
restricted to the cases raised by the MPs as well as reviewing the accounting
procedures, processes and reconciliations undertaken in relation to the cases in
question. Before formal instructions are given to the Independent Auditors, agreements
will be sought from all interested parties, namely the Members of Parliament and Justice
for Sub postmasters. The Sub postmasters have requested a Forensic Accountant of
their choice be appointed to oversee the Cases being reviewed by 2 nd Sight.
All the above is accepted based on the terms of the Review being carried out, but this is
in no way an acknowledgement by the Post Office that there is an issue with Horizon,
Over the past ten years many millions of branch reconciliations have been carried out
with transactions and balances accurately recorded by more than 25,000 different sub

Further to my previous statements dated 19th November 2012 and 20th November 2012
1 can confirm from Post Office Ltd Human Resources records that Kym WYLLIE was

appointed sub postmaster of Win                                                                                 GRO


Sub postmasters are contracted to provide services to customers. As such they receive

a monthly remuneration commensurate with the level of business conducted at the

branch and are provided with a balance of cash and stock to allow them to provide

these services.

All transactions conducted by the sub postmaster are recorded on a computer based
accounting system known as Horizon, which is used in all Post Office branches. The
system records all transactional data inputted by a counter clerk during an accounting
period and provides daily and weekly records enabling counter clerks and sub
postmasters to produce a balance of cash and stock on hand.
At the completion of each Branch Trading Statement if there is a shortage in the
accounts the sub postmaster in accordance with his contract, must make good the
shortage by accepting the shortage on the Horizon system prior to rolling over the cash
and stock into the next Branch Trading Period.

Continuation Statement                        Stephen BRADSHAW
of

For all shortages of £150 or less the sub postmaster is expected to immediately make
good this shortage by either cash or cheque. For all shortages over £150 he can make
good the loss on the Horizon system by "settling centrally". By settling centrally the sub
postmaster will pay a sum out of his remuneration each month until the shortage has
been cleared.
Section 12 of the sub postmaster's contract deals with the Responsibility for Post Office
Stock and Cash.
Sub section 12 and 13 of this contract deal with Losses.
12. The sub postmaster is responsible for all losses caused through his own negligence,
carelessness or error and also for losses of all kinds caused by his assistants.
Deficiencies due to such losses must be made good without delay.
13. The financial responsibility of the Sub postmaster does not cease when he
relinquishes his appointment and he will be required to make good any losses incurred
during his term of office which may subsequently come to light.
Sub section 14 of this contract deals with Gains.
14. Surpluses may be withdrawn provided that any subsequent charge up to the amount
withdrawn is made good immediately.
I now produce Section 12 and 13 of the sub postmaster's contract as SB/3.

ACCIDENTAL LOSS


If at any time any items of stock (including stock of no intrinsic value such as motor vehicle
       licences) is found to be missing. Steps must be taken at once to ascertain what has
      happened to the missing items. The serial numbers must be ascertained (see 2(a)) and
      verified by examination of items in stock, and the requisition forms examined to
      discover whether or not any of the items purport to have been issued out of sequence.
      All the requisition forms for the previous 3 months must at the same time be
      impounded and held for instructions_ If, after careful search, the missing items cannot
      be found and are thought to have been mislaid only, or inadvertently destroyed, a
      preliminary report of the loss giving the serial numbers of the items in question must be
      sent to the Regional General Manager.


STOLEN ITEMS


1.    If as a result of burglary, break in, theft, or suspected theft any items of stocks are
      missing the facts should be reported as quickly as possible to the Regional General

            so, particulars of the type in it when stolen. If the date stamp has not been stolen

            believe that it has been used upon the stolen items.


      (c)   A specimen impression of the date stamp and, if it was stolen, particulars of the
             type in it when stolen.
