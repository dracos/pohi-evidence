Twas most grateful to receive your kind letter of 19 March.

[have indeed maintained a close personal interest in developments at

Aycliffe and have been enormously encouraged by your company’s unreserved

and wholehearted commitment to the work of the Response Group. I share your

views on the excellence of Kingsley Smith’s leadership and I am most grateful

that he has been able to rely upon the fullest possible co-operation from Fujitsu in

every respect.

The fate of your former employees was of particular concern fo me. i

very much appreciated the speed and effectiveness with which they have been

resettled. I am pleased that Government and regional agencies were able to play

their part, and my congratulations go to you and your colleagues involved in this

excellent achievement.

Meanwhile, however, it was also important that every possible opportunity

1 to find a buyer for the plant who could make use of

should be explored in orde
the existing skills base. Tam extremely appreciative of your company’s wide-

ranging endeavour to find such a purchaser and willingness to go to great lengths
