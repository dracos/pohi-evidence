POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF PETER WILLIAM JOBSON

|, MR PETER WILLIAM JOBSON, will say as follows:
INTRODUCTION

1. | am a Customer Solution Architect level 3 (“CSA3”) in the Host development team at
Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”). | have been in this role since September 2009.

2. This witness statement is made on behalf of Fujitsu to assist the Post Office Horizon
IT Inquiry (the “Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request provided to
Fujitsu on 11 March 2022 and a series of further questions provided to me by the
Inquiry on 1 July 2022 (the “Request”), to the extent | have direct knowledge of such
matters.

3. The Request relates to matters that took place more than 15 years ago. Where | was
involved in these matters, | have tried to recall events to the best of my ability, but my
recollection is limited.

4. In preparing this statement, | have refreshed my memory by reviewing
contemporaneous documents relating to questions asked by the Inquiry in the

Request. Where | have seen documents relevant to the Request, these documents

Page 1 of 17

are referred to using references WITN0482_01/1 — WITN0482_01/9 and are listed in
the index accompanying this statement. To the extent that these documents have not
already been provided to the Inquiry, they are exhibited to this statement.

BACKGROUND

5. In July 1997, | was invited to join ICL PLC (“ICL”) as a contractor working in the Host
development team, where | worked on Oracle database design and development. |
primarily worked on backend database applications and the development of the
payment authorisation system (“PAS”) and Card Management System (“CMS”) being
delivered by the software company Oracle UK (“Oracle UK”) to supply benefit
payments for Post Office branches, known as the “PAS/CMS Project”. | worked in
this role until the PAS/CMS Project was cancelled. After this time, | worked on other
data-centre based database systems including the Fujitsu Data Warehouse. | left ICL
in June 2001. During my time at ICL, | initially reported to Bill Hillyard, who reported
to Terry Austin. Later, | reported to Chris Humphries. At this time | had no concerns
with the Oracle Relational Database product nor did | have any concerns with the
quality of the team from Oracle who were initially responsible for the design and
development of the PAS/CMS Project.

6. | returned to work for Fujitsu as a full-time employee around June or July 2003 and
re-joined the Post Office Account, taking up responsibilities similar to those that | had
previously as a contractor. | worked on various database subsystems including the
Transaction Processing System (“TPS”), Logistics Feeder System (“LFS”), Data
Reconciliation System (“DRS”), Network Banking Persistent store (“NPS”),

Transaction Enquiry Service (“TES”) and AP-Out Payments (“APOP”). During this

Page 2 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

time, | primarily reported to Dave Johns, who reported to Alan D’Alvarez. | left this

role and Fujitsu in March 2006. During this time | do not recall having concerns in

relation to the function or robustness of TPS, LFS, DRS, NPS, TES or APOP.

. lreturned again to Fujitsu in September 2009 as a CSA3 and re-joined the Post Office
Account in the Host development team. During this time, | was involved in the process
of implementing the HNG-X solution and ongoing functional change as required by
Post Office Limited (“Post Office”). As a CSA3, my role included the following tasks
and responsibilities:

a. |liaised with business requirement owners and derived software designs to meet
these requirements

b. | liaised with development, test and delivery teams to ensure that the business
requirements were correctly interpreted by the design and software deliverables,
including by helping testers to understand test outcomes

c. | performed other activities requested of me by my line manager, including
reviewing design and interface documents, engaging with auditors and providing
live support

. Until 2006 | belonged to the Host Database development team that would have
reported into an overall Development manager. After 2009 | belonged to an
Architecture Team that also reports into an overall Development manager. When
there are live affecting issues, these are currently managed by the Customer Services
team who ensure that there is sufficient interaction between internal teams, Post

Office and any affected 3rd party clients.

9. All of my previous roles have involved database design and development, including
in relation to the implementation of the Horizon IT system (the “Project”) and the
IMPACT Programme (“IMPACT”). However, | had limited involvement in those
aspects of the Project concerning Post Office branch trading, which is operated using
counter applications. | was not, for example, involved in the design, development,
testing or roll out of counter applications to Post Office branches.

THE REQUEST

10.1 have reviewed the topics listed in Appendix 1 of the Request, and | am able to
provide information in response to certain questions under the following topics:
Design and Development, Acceptance Criteria and Testing, and Modifications.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

Key stages in the design and development of Horizon

11.During the period up until 2000, the design and development of the PAS/CMS Project
followed a waterfall methodology, which | explain at paragraph [12] of my statement
below. Most of the Oracle design and development was performed by Oracle UK
before this responsibility was transferred to an ICL team (which | only know as the
A&TC team) based in Dublin. Oracle UK implemented internal peer reviews of
designs, test plans and test outcomes. During this period | was also responsible for
designing interfaces to the Data Warehouse system. For example, | authored the
‘PAS/ICMS MIS Data Extract High Level Design’ dated 2 April 1998
(WITN0482_01/1).

12.As | mentioned at paragraphs 5-6 in my statement above, | left ICL in June 2001 and

returned to Fujitsu in June or July 2003. From the period 2003 onwards, the design

Page 4 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

and development of the Horizon IT system (“Horizon”) also followed a waterfall
methodology. Designs of the database applications were created and reviewed at a
high level (“High Level Designs”), which were then used to generate more detailed
low level designs (“Low Level Designs”) before development started. This process
was subject to quality controls and change management processes, with peer
reviews at all levels from ‘End-to-End’ designs, High Level Designs through to Low
Level Designs, coding and testing. Each type of design document had its own list of
mandatory reviewers that could vary according to the subject matter of the document.
The review process was controlled by a document management team who ensured
that the review process iterated until all comments were resolved. A document would
only be approved and moved to a ‘major version’ once all comments were responded
to satisfactorily. Generally, development would only begin once the design document
had reached its first ‘major version’. This design and development methodology was
used in relation to IMPACT, which | describe and explain further in this statement at
[31] below.

13.As | mentioned in this statement above at paragraph [6], from the period 2003
onwards, | was mainly involved in one aspect of the Project, being Oracle database
design. My primary role was to take an end-to-end design proposal (“Design
Proposal”) that was created by one of the leading architects and create a more
detailed High Level Design covering the component(s) that were my area of
responsibility. One exception to this was my work with the automation of cash pouch
remittances, where | documented the design at all layers of the architecture; | cannot

recall why | was asked to or otherwise documented this design.

Oversight of the design and development of Horizon

14.There were many teams working on different aspects of design and development
within the Project, including a counter development team, a team responsible for all
Riposte development and On-Line/Bulk Banking agents, and the Host development
team of which | was a member. These multiple design and development streams
operated in parallel. Generally, members of one development team worked in one
layer of the architecture and did not have involvement in other parts of the system.
The individual teams communicated with each other to ensure that different parts of
the system interfaced together to produce a coherent solution. The senior
management and architecture team for the Project had a more overarching view of
the end-to-end development of Horizon.

15. Each team would have implemented its own development processes and procedures.
This was because the nature of the layers of the architecture are different. The
counter application is a GUI (graphical user interface) that was originally written in
Basic and latterly in Java (which are programming languages), the Agent team dealt
with real-time or near-real-time messaging systems using different technologies, and
the Host team implemented Batch processing systems in Pro*C, PL/SQL and shell
scripting (which are also programming languages). The development and unit testing
needs of each environment are different. | do not know what controls were in place
to ensure that development processes and procedures were adequate.

16. There were also different layers of management and oversight. | do not recall who
was responsible for carrying out and overseeing the design and development of

Horizon.

Factors influencing the design and development of Horizon

17.During the period 1997 to 2001, | was not involved in the decision-making at the
Project and senior management level as to the design and development of Horizon,
such as making decisions as to the choice of architecture, or the choice of product to
implement that architecture. For this reason, | cannot identify and explain the specific
factors which influenced the design and development of Horizon.

18.1 can recall however that quality and design standards dictated how the Host
development team would design and develop databases and interface databases
with each other. For example, | can recall contributing to the ‘Host Applications
Database Design and Interface Standards’ dated 29 April 1999 (WITN0482_01/2),
which related to best practice for implementing data centre Oracle database
applications. This provided rules for any database design in order to meet the
business need of robust and supportable software, including:

a. Standards (naming and coding)

b. Best principles (resilience, recovery, auditing, archiving)
c. Supportability, monitoring

d. Languages, defensive programming, performance

e. Self-containment and interfacing

f. Security

g. Documentation requirements

19. However, most database applications were initially only required to store, aggregate,
transform and forward data; for example, taking transaction data from the counters to

consumers, such as the Management Information System, Central Financial Systems

Page 7 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

or Automated Payment clients. Or alternatively, transmitting the data in the other
direction, such as sending reference data from Post Office to Riposte. In time,
additional database systems were implemented: DRS to reconcile Banking and
Payment Card transactions, TES to provide Banking reconciliation and transaction
query and APOP to support transaction persistence for a range of counter data
including Postal Orders and other data objects. Latterly the branch database was
implemented to store all Post Office branch data (“Branch Database”). Other
database systems that | have not had much involvement in are the Reference Data
Management Centre (RDMC) and the Reference Data Distribution System (RDDS).

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND TESTING

20.As designers and developers, the Host development team would have been
responsible for Low Level Design and testing from the unit test perspective.

21.This would involve testing all functional code paths to ensure they had been
exercised, that their responses were as expected, and that they met the requirements
and functionality described in the High Level Design. These tests and their results
would be peer reviewed before any deliverable was handed over to the integration
team. The integration team were responsible for packaging software deliverables
such that they could be released into test and live environments in a controlled and
repeatable manner. The integration team and release management would co-
ordinate software deliveries from different development teams together and release
these out to the integrated test rig(s) such that dependencies between software
versions at each layer of the architecture were met. Currently there are the following

test environments:

Page 8 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

a. Development - Unit testing
b. CIT - Counter application testing integrated with a limited data centre
c. SV&l - Functional test environment with emulators simulating external entities
such as financial institutions

d. LST - Live support test, non-functional testing and software release testing
e. RDT -4 sets of test rigs devoted to testing new reference data

22.Once handed over to the integration team, | was not involved in aiding the testing
process, and | am not aware of what methods were used from an integrated test
perspective. From the period 2009 onwards | have had more involvement with the
integration test team including knowledge transfer, helping with the creation of test
data and occasionally reviewing test plans and test outputs.

MODIFICATIONS

The IMPACT Programme

23. IMPACT was related to, but not limited to, Post Office’s migration away from the cash
account to monthly accounting, and the implementation of the Post Office Limited
Financials System (“POL-FS”), which was operated using a system provided by the
software company, SAP (“SAP”). IMPACT was called the End-to-End Re-Architecture
programme in its early days (“E2E”), and some scope of the programme is provided
in High Level Design documents, including the documents that | refer to below.

24.As part of the first E2E project (“E2E Project 1”), | was responsible for modifying
some cash logistics designs that better automated the remittance in of cash pouches
at Post Office branches and provided better control of the remittance out of cash and

its subsequent collection by delivery drivers. Post Office made the decision to modify

Page 9 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

some cash logistics processes as part of the ‘E2E Release 1’ project that was active
in 2003 and 2004. Details of this work are described in technical documents, including
the following:
a. ‘LFS E2E Release 1 — Delta High Level Design’ dated 19 January 2004
(WITNO0482_01/3)
b. ‘E2E Release 1 — LFS Counter Dialogue Delta — Activity & Screen Flows’ dated
5 January 2004 (WITN0482_01/4)

25.As part of E2E Project 1, | was responsible for modifying some counter and central
database system designs to provide cash liability totals for Post Office branches to
POL-FS. Details of this work are described in ‘End to End Release 1 — High Level
Design’ dated 19 January 2004 (WITN0482_01/5) (“E2E R1”). | produced E2E R1,
which concerned the delivery of two projects under release ‘BI3 S60’, which led to
changes to the LFS and TPS.

26.As part of the third E2E project (“E2E Project 3”), | was involved in the designs for
migrating Post Office branches from their old accounting system (which | only know
as ‘CBDB’) to POL-FS, by migrating data feeds coming from the Post Office’s branch
estate to Post Office’s backend financial systems. | do not recall having concerns
about the migration process prior to undertaking it nor being aware of any known
issues at the time. This process involved making changes to the counter estate and
the ‘Store and Forward’ system in the datacentre, known as TPS. Details of this work,
including the scope of IMPACT, are described technical documents, including the

following:

Page 10 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

a. ‘Impact Release 3 - Counter Design for Declaration, Correction and Revaluation’
dated 8 September 2005 (WITN0482_01/6)
b. ‘Impact Release 3 — Declaration, Correction and Revaluation User Interface’
dated 9 September 2004 (WITN0482_01/7)
c. ‘TPS POL FS Summarisation High Level Design’ dated 19 August 2005
(WITN0482_01/8)
27.The TPS system was originally responsible for capturing data from the Riposte
messaging mid-layer and aggregating this data before passing it onto external
consumers of the transaction data and financial information. In 2009 and 2010, TPS
took its data feed from the Branch Database and it was eventually retired in 2020
since its business functionality had been subsumed into the Branch Database
application.
28.As part of E2E Project 3 | was involved in the delivery of summarised data from TPS
to the ‘HRSAP’ system for the purposes of postmaster remuneration. This project
also included the processing the receipt of ‘Transaction Corrections’ from POL-FS
and forwarding this information to Post Office branches. Details of this work, including
in relation to the HRSAP system, are described in ‘TPS HR SAP Summarisation &
Transaction Corrections High Level Design’ dated 24 November 2004
(WITNO482_01/9).
29.Between 2003 and 2006, the work of the design and development teams working on
IMPACT was driven by a number of software releases (“Software Releases’). | was

involved in designs for some of these releases, and | recall being involved in releases

Page 11 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

that were delivered under IMPACT, which | have described above at paragraphs [24]—
[28].

30.During the IMPACT programme, Software Releases would cover changes to both the
counter applications and the datacentre applications. Generally, the process would
involve a Solution Architect preparing a Design Proposal, which pulled together the
end-to-end impact of the changes that were required to the individual layers of
Horizon’s architecture to meet Post Office’s requirements. At the time, | was not
aware of any problems new Software Releases could cause, and it was not part of
my role at that time to be made aware of such problems.

31.The Design Proposal would be a High Level Design that covered the entire solution
and would be reviewed by each of the teams at each layer of the architecture (e.g.,
counter development team, Riposte team or Host development team). The Design
Proposal would be commented upon, and then each of the individual teams would
produce High Level Designs that would meet the requirements of the Design
Proposal. These High Level Designs would then be used to formulate and produce
Low Level Designs that provided the more technical design aspects of the application.
My ‘layer’ was the database layer, and | developed and produced the designs for the
datacentre and occasionally the counter. This included the High Level Designs and
occasionally Low Level Design documents, such as E2E R1, which | mentioned
above at paragraph [25]. At page two of this document is a section titled ‘Review
details’ that lists the various individuals who were required to or otherwise reviewed

E2E R’1, including which reviewers returned comments.

Page 12 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

32. The individual teams would only generally work on their layer of the architecture. For
example, | could be involved in the ‘S90 release’ from a database perspective, but
not have fully appreciated or understood the design and development that was
occurring for the counter application despite their interaction with one another. This
was generally the job of the Design Proposal to knit the layers together.

33.Post Office’s business requirements would often affect all the layers of Horizon’s
architecture, and a member of the Architecture team would liaise with all the subject
matter experts (“SMEs”) to determine how the end-to-end flow of data would work.
For example, if Post Office's financial systems required additional information from
Post Office branches, this would involve:

a. Acchange to the Counter Business Application

b. Achange to the transport layer that delivers the information to the data centre

c. Achange to the database schema to store the new data

d. Achange to the data centre application to deliver the new information to the final

consumer

After the Architecture team had defined the overall data flows in the Design
Proposal, individual SMEs for each component were then responsible for updating
their existing High Level Design, and once that new function was implemented, the
Design Proposal would become redundant. Design Proposals, now known as
‘Customer Solution Proposals’ and ‘Project Solution Designs’ become stagnant
once the change for those new requirements has been implemented.

34.Post Office have new business requirements whenever there is an opportunity to

improve the system or provide new services to customers. The impact of a new

Page 13 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

requirement of Horizon generally involves a change to either the software and/or
system configuration.

35. Fujitsu’s design and development teams continue to work based on the model | have
described above. The architecture is layered, and the teams are responsible for their
respective aspects of the Horizon system (now ‘Horizon Online’). For example, there
are agents that operate on Microsoft Windows operating systems, Oracle database
applications and employees who are experts in the counter or the Branch Access
Layer (“BAL”). High Level Designs and Low Level Designs are maintained for each
one of these components of the system.

36.My work on IMPACT also involved modifying the way in which cash pouches were
remitted in and remitted out from stock units in the Post Office branch. When cash
was remitted out from a stock unit into a cash pouch, the value of cash would be
transferred into the suspense account until the pouch was collected by a delivery
driver. At the point of collection, the value of cash in the collected pouches was
transferred out from the suspense account such that it was no longer the liability of
the Post Office branch. Other changes may have been made to the local suspense
account that | am not aware of.

Technical issues identified during the pilots of Horizon Online

37.1 recall there being a technical issue during the first pilot of Horizon Online around
November 2009, as | started monitoring the datacentre batch schedules to see
whether the system was experiencing performance issues at the backend. The
second-line support team identified that the transfer of data from the Branch

Database to TPS was causing an issue because four highly configured Oracle nodes

Page 14 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

were pushing data into a Solaris box, which was overloading it from a network
perspective. The issue was discovered because the overnight datacentre batch
schedules failed at the point of delivering data to TPS, and the issue was initially
overcome by manually resubmitting the failed batch jobs. The issue was permanently
resolved by controlling resources in the batch schedules to reduce the number of
concurrent data feeds to the Solaris system, which lessened the data load and
prevented the issue from reoccurring. The issue was internal to Fujitsu and it could
not have had an impact on data integrity, as there was a process of data reconciliation
between the Branch Database and TPS systems to prove data integrity, and failed
processes relating to batch jobs could be run again.

38.1 recall there being a second technical issue in May or June 2010 where rollout had
to be paused due to performance issues and there were two reasons:
a. Oracle clearing its cache when we truncated tables
b. The BAL was not using bind variables in its queries, which was causing

unnecessary work for the Oracle cost base optimiser

39.1 was not closely involved in this second issue, which was managed and resolved by
the database administrators, who investigated the performance problems. One of the
key players in this research and resolution was Andy Beardmore. Post Office were
aware of the second issue as the rollout of Horizon Online was temporarily paused
until the issue was resolved.

THE ROBUSTNESS OF HORIZON

40.1 was not aware and did not have any concerns regarding the robustness of Horizon

during the time of my involvement in the Project.

Page 15 of 17
WITN04820100
WITN04820100

41.1 was not involved and am not aware as to what information ICL Pathway may have
provided Post Office Counters Limited and/or the government about the robustness

of Horizon.
