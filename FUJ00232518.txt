2 Introduction

This document is a Contract-Controlled Document (CCD).

2.1 Intent of Agreement

The intent of this Interface Agreement is to establish effective co-operation between Fujitsu
Services(Pathway) Ltd and Post Office Ltd for the timely efficient and cost effective delivery
of Operational Business Change — Product using Reference Data to Horizon enabled post
office counters.

[DN Aspects of this agreement are also relevant to Branch Reference Data.]

This Agreement identifies:

e Post Office Ltd and Pathway’s requirement for Product changes introduced via
Reference Data,

e the agreed end-to-end service solution for Pathway and Post Office Ltd, both separately
and jointly, for implementing such changes and

e the obligations of both parties, both separately and jointly, that must be met in order to
deliver the solution.

There are a number of documents (which are not CCDs) that describe the interfaces and
agreements made between Pathway and Post Office Ltd for the management of Operational
Business Changes. This document provides an “umbrella” agreement for those others and
they will comply with the Agreements made within this Interface Agreement.

Whilst this Agreement serves as an umbrella for other documentation it cannot supersede any
contractual obligations defined within the Contract Schedules. The timescales shown later in
this document are those which are agreed by both parties to be operationally viable and as
such form the basis of normal business practice when implementing changes to Reference
Data.

2.2 Maintenance of this Agreement

This Agreement is applicable to the Network Banking Horizon release. It will be reviewed for
any future major software release and on an on-going basis. It is maintained by Pathway on
behalf of both parties.

2.3 Future Developments

Post Office Ltd and Pathway agree to work jointly to improve the quality and effectiveness of
the Reference Data interface as follows:

¢ Review the functionality, scope and effectiveness of the Reference Data test environment
and enhance where appropriate.

¢ Continuously monitor the toolset available in the test environment, in particular the
Reference Data comparison tool for identifying impact of planned Reference Data
changes with the possibility of enhancement where appropriate.

¢ Continuously monitor and where necessary improve the Reference Data Change
Catalogue (RDCC) relating to Reference Data requirements.

e Review the consolidated set of Business Rules and procedures which have been jointly
developed and implemented.

e Continuously improve the scope and effectiveness of Business and System tests.

The programme for delivery of each of the above will be overseen by the RDORF.

2.4 Service Management Policy

Service Management Policy is described in [ref 16]

2.5 Alerting when data is at risk of late delivery

When it is known that Reference Data may be at risk of non delivery by the time it is required
at branches an Alert may be required. The detail of the Alert Process is described in [ref 18].

The principles of the Alert Process with respect to data being delivered overnight to become
active at branches the following day are:

© to provide warning to relevant parties in Post Office Ltd and Pathway, that there is
risk of critical reference data not being available at branches the following day

© to allow appropriate contingency to be invoked against that risk where lack of the
data would cause critical problems

The process may similarly be invoked if the final milestone is known to be at risk (see section
9.3)

The process is initially invoked by Post Office Ltd setting the Alert Flag on the Release
Authorisation Form. If the Release Day is the day prior to the Start Date, and the Alert Flag
is set, RDT will initiate the warning process.

3 Scope

3.1 Interfaces

This Agreement covers all the interfaces between Pathway and Post Office Ltd that support
the Operational Business Change process for pre-defined product changes. In this version it
has been extended to encompass the Network Banking release of the Horizon system.

Interface Interface Interface

Post Office: Pathway Post Office Pathway
Ltd processI process Ltd processI process

* this step is not
needed if change isI
pre-authorised

The start is the point where an OBC form has been completed and issued within Post Office
Ltd, and the end point is where the Reference Data has been released within Pathway for
delivery to the live counters.

The delivery of the Reference Data to counters, following release authorisation, is covered by
the SLA [see section 3.3].

This Interface Agreement applies to both Advanced and Basic Product Changes where:

« a Basic Change is a change which consists solely of Reference Data which requires no
additional Pathway actions and may be submitted to Pathway without notice

e an Advanced Change is a change which requires additional Pathway activity and is
subject to advanced notification.

3.2 Branch Reference Data Changes

This Interface Agreement does not cover Reference Data for Branch Change [see ref. 11].

(DN: Refer to statement in section 2.1]

3.3 SLA

The contractual provisions relating to the distribution of Reference Data are defined in the
SLA in Contract Schedule G10 as follows:.

3.4 Operational Business Change processes

The Operational Business Change (OBC) process for product change is defined in [ref. 1] and
the types of change that qualify for the OBC process are defined in the Reference Data
Change Catalogue (RDCC) [ref. 2,]. Changes not found in the RDCC must be requested via
the normal Change Control mechanism (CR/CCN).

A summary of the process is given below.

Note:

Not every Change Type follows every step of the process [see section 5].
The timescales for each stage of the process are defined in [section 5].
The types of change that the process applies to are defined in [section 4].
The responsibilities of each party are defined in [section 8].

3.5 Icon Change

Whilst the introduction of Icons (the pictures which appear on buttons) on the Horizon
desktop is not contractually a part of the OBC process, the scope of this document has been
extended to include the process for introducing new, or amending existing, Icons. The
process and agreed timescales for Icon change are described in [ref 20].

4 Types of Change

4.1 Introduction

Change types are pre-defined for inclusion into the OBC — product process. This definition
can be found in the Reference Data Change Catalogue (RDCC) [ref. 2]. Each pre-defined
change type is grouped as shown in the table in section 1.

The RDCC Product Change categories that apply to these changes are listed in sections 4.2
and 4.6 below. The assumptions listed in the RDCC must be adhered to, in order to apply
these categorisations.

4.2 Standard Changes

The order of the change types in this section is significant and is an indication of the level of
risk with each type and therefore the amount of checking that is deemed to be necessary. The
change types are in order of increasing risk from those which need little or no checking, as the
effect of an error would be minimal on the Live estate, to those which need extensive
checking, as the effect of an error may be significant on the Live estate. Those changes,
which are deemed to require minimal or no checking, are classified as Basic - Pure. Those
changes, which are deemed to require most checking, are classified as Advanced — Complex
or Advanced Complex Extended.

A complete list of changes applicable to each type is held within the RDCC. Should Post
Office Ltd decide that additional checking is required, a change may be submitted in a type
with a higher risk position in this section. However the converse is not true, in that a change
can never be requested with a lower risk position than the type shown in the RDCC.

Appendix B: Standard Changes - Details, shows a representative list of the changes for each
type.
4.2.1 Basic - Pure

Basic Changes do not require advanced notification from Post Office Ltd to Pathway (OBC
form). The delivery of the Reference Data file using agreed mechanisms [see section 0.3] is
the request for change. The file must identify that its contents are Basic Pure changes. The file
may contain more than one change of the same type. All Basic files contain only Class 1
Reference Data items. Pathway checks the contents of the file are appropriate for the type of
change. Pure changes do not require verification and are pre-authorised for release.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 30 September 2002

4.2.2 Basic — High Risk

Basic Changes do not require advanced notification from Post Office Ltd to Pathway (OBC
form). The delivery of the Reference Data file using agreed mechanisms [see section 0.3] is
the request for change. The file must identify that its contents are a Basic High Risk change.
The file may contain more than one change of the same type. All Basic files contain only
Class 1 Reference Data items. Pathway checks the contents of the file are appropriate for the
type of change. High Risk changes require a Verification and a Comparison report and
authorisation by Post Office Ltd before release.

4.2.3, Advanced Simple

Advanced Simple changes require advanced notification from Post Office Ltd to Pathway (an
OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files must be identifiable as
such through the BCR number. Pathway checks the contents of the file are appropriate for
this type of change. Pathway has actions to take to implement the change (in addition to
processing the Type A Reference Data file from Post Office Ltd) e.g. update documentation,
but these actions can occur after the change has been released and therefore do not extend the
lead-time for the change. These changes require a Verification and a Comparison report and
authorisation by Post Office Ltd before release.

4.2.4 Advanced Standard

Advanced Standard changes require advanced notification from Post Office Ltd to Pathway
(an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files must be identifiable as
such through the BCR number. Pathway checks the contents of the file are appropriate for
this type of change. Pathway has actions to take to implement the change (in addition to
processing the Type A Reference Data file from Post Office Ltd) e.g. process Type B files,
and these actions must occur before the change has been released, therefore the lead-times are
longer than for Simple or Basic changes. These changes require a Verification and a
Comparison report and authorisation by Post Office Ltd before release.

4.2.5 Advanced Complex

Advanced Complex changes require advanced notification from Post Office Ltd to Pathway
(an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files must be identifiable as
such through the BCR number. Pathway checks the contents of the file are appropriate for
this type of change. Pathway must generate Type C Reference Data to implement the change
and test that the change works as requested in the OBC form. These changes require a
Verification and a Comparison report and authorisation by Post Office Ltd before release.

4.2.6 Advanced Complex Extended

This category of change has been introduced to differentiate from ordinary Advanced
Complex changes as the leadtime is longer to allow for additional validation/verification. In
all other respects this category is identical to Advanced Complex.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 30 September 2002
4.3 AP

AP changes are similar to Advanced Complex changes and require notification from Post
Office Ltd to Pathway (an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files
must be identifiable as such through the BCR number. Pathway checks the contents of the
file are appropriate for this type of change. Pathway has actions to take to implement the
change e.g. test Tokens and supply test files to the appropriate Post Office Ltd Client for Post
Office Ltd End to End testing of changes. These changes require a Verification and a
Comparison report, additional testing and authorisation by Post Office Ltd before release.

(as described in relevant AP documentation)

Introduce new AP client, service or token
Change client name (new token data)
Cease AP Client, product or token
Introduce new Smart Card

Notes on AP change:

e Changing AP product details when an end-to-end test file is not required falls outside the
category of AP change and is to be treated in the same way as any other product change.

e Ceasing AP Client, product or token when the service is Live, i.e. it is not being
withdrawn from a current CTO cycle, is to be implemented as an Advanced Simple
change, with the client service list being amended after the event.

4.4 System Parameters - Pure

With the introduction of Network Banking there is the need to provide a relatively speedy
method of changing some specific system parameters within defined limits. This new
category provides the mechanisms by which Post Office Ltd can request such changes.
Provided that the requested change falls within the limits specified within the Contract
Schedules Pathway will process the request and deliver the change directly to the Live estate
as there is no verification possible for such changes.

4.5 Icon Change

Changes to Icons are processed in a similar way to other OBC changes however, in most
cases Icons are produced in batches rather than individually. Full details of the process for
Icon changes are described in [ref 20]

4.6 Fast-track changes

4.6.1 Basic Express

A Basic Express change is a subset of Basic High Risk changes and must comply with the
definitions in [section 4.2.1]. However, the lead-times [see section 5] specified for a Basic
Express change can only be achieved where verification can be performed on the basis of the
Verification Report and not a Comparison Report. The type of change must be such that there

is minimal risk of error occurring elsewhere within the system as a result of applying the
change and is therefore limited to:

Change price of non-value stock
Change price of revaluable value stock *
Change min/max quantity/value

Change Long/ Medium / Short name

The limits for use are:

only for the categories of change which conform to the above e.g. ‘Ticket and
Travel’ products or to meet the requirement for Tight Timescales

only OBCs that must be active on completion of the change within 48hrs &

 OBCs must be received by Post Office Ltd Change Implementation Team by 10am
on a working weekday and

® only normal volumes of change as defined in [section 5.11]

© the Change Number must start with defined prefixes [ref. 15 and 22]. If a Change
is delivered to Pathway with this prefix but the contents do not meet the specified
criteria it will be processed according to the normal lead-times. Pathway will
inform Post Office Ltd using the incident process.

* Note: When a Basic High Risk change is to change the price of revaluable value stock,
Horizon counters will prompt counter staff on each of the three calendar days prior to
when revaluation will need to be performed, provided that the Reference Data is already
at the counter. Should a similar change be put through the Basic Express mechanism,
this prompting period may be for less than three calendar days. It is Post Office Ltd’s
responsibility to provide any additional notification required to users.

& Where the change is as described above, the requirement for completion within 48hrs may
be extended, if required, to allow for this 3 calendar day period.

4.6.2. Migration Special

A Migration Special change is a specific subset of Basic Pure changes and must comply
with the definitions in [section 4.2.1]. Migration Specials are pre-authorised for release
and no verification is required.

Migration Special changes are additions only to the Reference Data defining which non-
core products a particular branch can sell, normally where the branch has been selling the
item but the Reference Data does not reflect this. This Reference Data is needed so that
the Cash Account can record those sales, when it is migrated to the Horizon system.

The limits for use are:

additions to Non-core Product to Branch mappings only

Reference Data must be received by Pathway by 10am for release to be actioned
on the day of receipt or a phone call is required requesting a later file to be
released

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 30 September 2002

Reference Data files must be identifiable as Migration Specials

Migration Specials differ from the standard Basic Pure change for adding non-core
associations to an branch by virtue of:

® the urgency with which the data needs to be delivered to the branch.
® Migration Specials refer to one branch or one product — the normal Basic Pure
change may have any combination of products and branches.

Where possible Post Office Ltd should use the Basic Pure change for addition of non-
core association records.

Once Pathway has confirmed that the Reference Data is of the required type it will be
released to the ‘Live’ environment.

4.6.3. Tight Timescales

4.6.3.1 Requirement

Requirement 539/3 states there is a need to “implement changes to Reference Data to tight
timescales. As an example of such timescales, it shall be possible to implement Reference
Data changes consequent on a [Treasury] Budget by start of business on the following day”.

4.6.3.2 Definition

A Tight Timescale change is caused by either:

© an emergency situation where normal lead-times cannot be adhered to because of legal
circumstances outside of Post Office Ltd control, or

«to allow Post Office Ltd to exploit commercial opportunities.

Each instance of such change must be notified in writing by Post Office Ltd to Pathway and
agreed between Post Office Ltd Head of Network Support and the Pathway Customer
Service Director or their nominated authorised deputies.

4.6.3.3 Types

Analysis by Post Office Ltd of the business requirements indicates that the types of change
that require to be actioned in Tight Timescales are:

e Price changes

e Emergency cessation of a product

e Product introduction or change where the product has been created in advance with
interim details.

a) Price Change

The most frequent Tight Timescale changes are price changes. These may be processed via
the fast-track Basic Express route.

b) Emergency cessation

From the CSR+ version of Horizon the ability to transact a product is controlled by the use of
Item Transaction Modes and therefore these type of changes may be processed via the fast-
track Basic Express route.

©) Product introduction or change (with interim details)

A new product (or product change) can be introduced in advance of all details being available

e.g. to meet a late-breaking business opportunity. Mandatory details should be provided

initially, although some will have interim values

e.g.

e product name may be set to “test name” or other identifiably interim name.

e the cash account mapping may be to a lixne marked as “temporary” .

e the button for the product may not be introduced until a later date, with the product only
available to be sold by PLU initially.

The “interim” product should be verified using standard processes for product change [see
sections 3.4 and 5.6].

To set up the interim product the normal lead-times should be adhered to. When the interim

product cannot be set up with the normal lead-times, it will be dealt with as a high priority

exception [see section 9.2].

The interim details will be later replaced using:

* a Basic Express change for the final information relating to price and name. This must be
identifiable as part of the Tight Timescale change, and will be verified via the

Verification Report for Basic Express, before the change is released

e standard changes that occur after the go live of the product e.g. the introduction of the
button, or the change of the Cash Account mapping.

An example of the timeline is shown below:

4.6.3.4 Limitations when information is available at a very late stage

Whilst acknowledging that Post Office Ltd may not have control over legal or governmental
changes it must be recognised that the ability of the end to end process to produce, check,
authorise and release Reference Data takes a finite time and therefore it may not be possible
in all circumstances to meet the requirements. To this end the following are guidelines to the
limitations for Tight Timescales changes where the information is only made available at a
very late stage (e.g. 4 p.m. on a budget day).

e The time to key the data into the RDS system, extract and transmit to Pathway must
be considered (probably a minimum of I hour)

e The time that RDMC takes to process the incoming data must be considered
(approximately 30 minutes)

e If counter checks at Post Office Ltd are required an absolute minimum of 2 hours is
required for RDT system processing. It is therefore likely that this time will not be
available and therefore checking of the data can only be by review of reports —
minimum of 30 minutes to produce and transmit to OSG

e The time that Post Office Ltd will take to validate reports, or view data on counters
should time be available for extract, needs to be considered (estimated as a minimum
of 30 minutes)

e In order to meet normal operational schedules, authorisation to release a Tight
Timescales change should be received by Pathway by 7:30 p.m.

e The introduction of new items is impossible overnight. If there is a possibility that
new items will be needed their skeleton data must be set up in advance, as described
above in section 4.6.3.3.c

e Changes to Menu Hierarchy can only be achieved within Tight Timescales when
sufficient time is available — under normal circumstances, where the normal leadtime
is not available, a Business Critical Advanced Change may be appropriate

e An overnight change should therefore only be of the type which amends the price or
name of items

On the basis of the above timings, the latest time for commencement for an overnight Tight
Timescales change, such as Budget announcements, to be with RDOT for keying is 5 p.m. for
a change to be checked by report and 3 p.m. for a change to be checked by counter. Whilst
these timings are theoretically possible any error which occurs in data preparation or is
discovered during checking may affect the ability of all parties to complete the exercise.
Therefore, wherever possible more time should be given.

4.6.4 Live Fix

The time scale for incident correction is driven by the impact of the incident, the complexity
of the solution and the Start Date (or Agreed Date) for the change to be live at the branches.

4.6.5 Business Critical Advanced Change

It has been recognised that the Pathway and Post Office Ltd operational units have the ability,
in some circumstances, to shorten the OBC lead time without adversely impacting the success
of the change, or any other change in the system.

A Business Critical Advanced Change category has been introduced to permit operational
units to decide, where possible, to deliver change within a shorter time than the specified
leadtime. I BCAC does not replace Tight Timescales but rather offers an alternative,
operational, method (similar to Basic Express) of progressing Advanced changes.

= Each instance of a Business Critical Advanced Change must be agreed by each the groups
involved in the processing of the change (normally Post Office Ltd Change
Implementation Team, RDOT and RDT) before the change is submitted to Pathway for
action. This must include agreement on the effective date for the Reference Data

= The leadtime requirement for such a change must be shorter than that which would
normally be required to complete the change

= The agreed leadtime requirement must be achievable

= Any errors or modifications which occur in the delivery of such a change are likely to
cause failure to achieve the agreed leadtime

= Only minimal changes to the Menu Hierarchy are possible within shortened leadtimes. If
the introduction of a new item is required in short timescales this should be considered via
the PLU in the first instance with buttons to follow

= A maximum of I such change is permitted within any single week and 2 such changes in
any rolling 4 week period

= RDORF may, by agreement, modify the maximum quoted above

= RDORF will review each instance of such a change to establish why it was necessary to
invoke this process (without prejudice to any business confidentiality)

5 Lead-time for changes

5.1 Introduction

The lead-times quoted in this section are the end-to-end times covering both Post Office Ltd
and Pathway activities. Each party must meet each milestone applicable to it in order that the
subsequent milestones and the end-to-end lead-times are achieved. The types of change that
relate to each category are defined in [section 4].

These lead-times apply for the volumes given in [section 5.11].

The lead-time runs from initiating a change until the change is Released to the live system.
Delivery to Counters following release is as described in section 3.3

Notes:
For simplicity, the models used do not show activities that occur in parallel.

day = working weekday (Mon-Fri, excluding English Public Holidays)
adow = any day of the week, includes non working weekdays (Mon-Sun)
times = latest time action can occur to meet the schedule

Where a time is given next to a milestone, the time is critical to achieving that milestone.
Where the time is not given, the default is for the handover between organisations to be
complete by 8am. Failure to achieve a milestone by the given (or default) time potentially
extends the lead-time of the change.

Whilst there are indications of the time taken at each stage of the processing these cannot be
taken to be definitive, i.e. the overall leadtime should be taken as the most significant
information.

N.B. The leadtime should be used in relation to when data is required to be delivered to
counters on the Live estate, which may be earlier than the start date on the data.

6 Volume of change

6.1 Introduction

The Post Office Ltd forecast volume of Operational Business Change is shown in Appendix
A: OBC Volumes for Year 2002

On a 3 monthly basis the RDORF will review actual and forecast volumes to estimate the
impact on future capacity and lead-times.

6.2 Committed volumes

The Reference Data Operational Review Forum will review both changes to forecast and
actuals against the baseline.

The baseline for Reference Data record changes is given in the AIS [ref. 5].

Data, which is required specifically for the implementation of a new system release (e.g.
NWB), is exceptional to these committed volumes and as such will not be accounted within
any measurement against this Agreement.

Where:

e the quarterly forecast figures (or observed actuals) for a rolling 12 month period, show an
increase of more than 15% on the baseline for the (aggregated) total of all OBCs or for
all Reference Data records or

e Fast-track changes (excepting Migration Specials) exceed 10% of the rolling annual total
volume of changes, then

a Change Request (CR) is required for full impacting of the resource needed to deliver the
end-to-end process and to establish a new baseline.

Where these limits are exceeded changes will be processed as exceptions [see section 9.2].

N.B. Changes requested directly by Pathway or required to support a major system upgrade or
as otherwise agreed (e.g. database tidying activity) may be excluded from change volumes by
agreement between Post Office Ltd and Pathway.

6.2.1 Peaks in Business Change activity

e Where the total volume of Business changes raised in any week is no more than 15%
above the baseline, the changes will be processed to meet the agreements specified in this
document.

e Where the total volume of Business changes raised in any week is more than 15% above
the baseline, this is termed a ‘peak’.

Fujitsu Fujitsu Services ( Pathway) Ltd / Post Office Ltd Ref: CS/PRD/058
Services Interface Agreement for Operational Business
Change - Product Version: 8.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 30 September 2002

e Where the ‘peak’ is between 15% and 30% above the baseline, notification must be given
at least 1 week in advance, for the changes to be processed to meet the agreements
specified in this document.

e Where the ‘peak’ is between 30% and 50% above the baseline, notification must be given
at least 4 weeks in advance, for the changes to be processed to meet the agreements
specified in this document.

e Where the total volume of Business changes raised in any week is anticipated to be
greater than 50% above the baseline, or where the notice period of a peak is not possible,
the changes will be treated as an exception [see section 9.2].

e Where sufficient notice of an increase in volume over 50% above the baseline is
available, a CR can be raised to change the baseline.

e Where the total volume of Business changes is greater than 20% above the baseline, over
a 3-month period, a CR is required to change the baseline volumes.

RDORF will ensure that there is careful co-ordination of each component of the change(s)
and will prioritise between current work, where necessary.

Examples of peak activity are end of year and Tariff Changes.

a) End of year

The end of financial year changes will normally represent a peak in change activity. Changes

that can be expected at this time of year include:

e Cash Account changes (which are not covered by OBC processes but do need to be co-
ordinated with the OBC activity)

e changes caused by Budget decisions

© other product changes, e.g. Tariff Change or the introduction of new Homecare Stamp
Changes.

Post Office Ltd and Pathway will plan and manage these changes as separate peak change

projects.

b Tariff changes

A Tariff Change may include new product introduction, revaluation, price changes and/or
scales data changes, with multiple changes of each type. It may cause a large overhead on
verification, particularly of scales data, and requires careful co-ordination, as well as being
open to last minute amendment by Postcomm.

7 Deliverables

To ensure milestones are not put at risk all deliverables must be:

Complete and identifiable e.g. cross referencing change numbers

Error free [see section 9.3 for managing errors]

Correctly dated (see section 7.3)

Delivered by the relevant deadlines set out in the Interface Agreement [see section 5 for
required milestones]

e Delivered through the agreed mechanisms.

7.1 Post Office Ltd to Pathway

Post Office Ltd shall deliver to Pathway:

1) Reference Data for Advanced and Basic changes

2) Operational Business Change forms for Advanced changes and System Parameter Pure

3) Supporting items and/or information appropriate for changes e.g. AP tokens, Operational
Focus

4) Authorisation for Advanced and High Risk Basic changes

5) Volumetric forecasts of changes, including peaks

7.2 Pathway to Post Office Ltd

Pathway shall deliver to Post Office Ltd:

1) Reference Data direct to Live Counters, for OBCs that are pre-authorised by Post Office
Ltd.

2) Reference Data to Verification Counters, for OBCs to be verified, and that:
e include Type C Reference Data for Advanced changes when necessary
e has been validated to ensure changes work as requested on the OBC forms.

3) Verification and Comparison Reports (as appropriate) that identify exactly what changes
to the counter have been implemented

4) Reports to RDORF on volumetrics, including observed peaks.

7.3 Future Dating

Reference Data records contain a ‘Start Date’ which is the date on which the change is to
become effective on the Horizon counters. This date should always be in the future when the
data is created and remain a ‘future date’ throughout processing and distribution so that it is
still a future date when it arrives at the counters.

There is a risk to Post Office Ltd if the OBC process is not initiated sufficiently in advance of
the Start Date to allow for:

e the IFA lead-time for processing, validation, authorisation and release to the Live system
for that particular type of change

¢ the distribution time to branches.

e additional contingency where Post Office Ltd consider the Reference Data to have
business critical importance

Where, for whatever reason, Post Office Ltd are unable to initiate the OBC process
sufficiently in advance, then Post Office Ltd and Pathway would establish an Agreed Date to
supersede the Start Date.

Pathway reserves the right to log as a pre-live incident, the receipt of any Reference Data
which is not future dated. This is because data which has an immediate start date (i.e. any date
in the past at the time when the data reaches the Horizon counter) may have an adverse effect
and may create additional calls to HelpDesks.

The scheduling of non-future dated data by Post Office Ltd delaying authorisation of the
release of Reference Data is not an approved method.

9 Orders and exceptions

9.1 Orders

e The receipt in the CS Reference Data team mailbox of the OBC form is the confirmed
request from Post Office Ltd to Pathway, for Advanced and System Parameter Pure
Changes.

e The receipt of a Reference Data file containing only Basic (Class 1 Reference Data) in the
RDMC, is the confirmed request for change from Post Office Ltd to Pathway.

e The receipt of a correctly completed Authorisation Form from Post Office Ltd is the
confirmed authorisation to release the change.

e The receipt of pre-authorised change files (e.g. Migration Special, Pure Basic or System
Parameter Pure) clearly identified as such and containing that type of change, is the
authorisation for release of the changes.

e Requests for non-OBC changes (i.e. those not defined in the RDCC [ref. 2]) will not be
accepted and need to be submitted as a Change Request. However, the change request
may also initiate an update to the RDCC so that new changes are introduced to the OBC
process, where agreed. In many cases once a CR has been approved the delivery
mechanisms will be the same as, or similar to, those used for OBC.

9.2 Exceptions

Exceptions, e.g. to volumes or lead-times, will be processed using available resources without
any guarantee of service delivery. Both Post Office Ltd and Pathway shall notify the other
party when a request is recognised to be an exception.

Note: An agreed Deviation to the Service (e.g. Reference Data necessary for the
implementation of a new system release such as CSR+) is not an exception.

Post Office Ltd may wish to change the priority of an exceptional change so that it is given

preference over normal changes. In this instance the agreed lead-times may be extended pro
rata for displaced activities.

9.3 Errors and Rework

This section relates to errors or rework for both Product and Branch Reference Data, where
appropriate.

9.3.1 Recording Pre-Live Incidents

All observed errors will be recorded as pre-live incidents in accordance with the OLAs (refs.
12 & 13). The change will be suspended awaiting corrective action, potentially delaying the
achievement of that milestone for all changes affected by the error. For example, a file
containing records that are rejected will not be processed until the rejected records are
corrected and any other change which is in any way associated with the rejections may also be
delayed. Where the achievement of a milestone is at risk, corrective action will be taken by
the appropriate party or parties, by agreement, in order to achieve the final milestone, where
possible.

A pre-live incident will be raised for late deliverables.

If the Start Date contained within Reference Data record is not future dated or is set to a date
prior to the Required Date a pre-live incident will be raised i.e. the Start Date is either prior to
the date on the OBC form, or is not consistent with the overall lead-times (see section 7.3).

If it is known that the final milestone will not be achieved, or an alert has been requested and
the data is being released and will become active on the following day an Alert may be
necessary as described in section 2.5.

9.3.2 Rework categorisation and thresholds

Rework files are files which are, or appear to be, either Amendment files or Error Corrections
files to a change that is currently being progressed. They necessitate additional activity by all
parties and as such may have an impact on lead-times.

Appropriate steps shall always be taken to establish and eliminate the root cause of Rework.
This will be monitored by the RDORF

9.4 Escalation

Disagreements about the service e.g. whether a change is exceptional, will be raised, and
wherever possible resolved, at the RDORF. If agreement cannot be reached at the RDORF,
either party may invoke formal escalation mechanisms.

9.5 Charging

e AP Client Take-On is charged as specified [see ref. 4].
e Deviations to the service will be charged as per the CCN.
e Invoices will be raised and paid in accordance with Contract Schedule A10.

Changes to Horizon reports text fields or content which can be achieved directly using

is limited to those changes which can be made through Reference Data only and
requests for such changes not currently listed in the Reference Data Change
Catalogue must be confirmed with Pathway prior to raising the OBC. As changes of
this nature are identified they will be added to the Reference Data Change

Catalogue]

[DN: The introduction of all Network Banking entities and amendments to them, with
the exception of those noted in Basie — High Risk and System Parameters — Pure, will
be Advanced Complex Extended It should be noted that in the future additional
checking of Network Banking Reference Data may be deemed to be necessary, in a
similar fashion to that currently used for AP, in which case leadtimes will need
further consideration.

Please note that Network Banking Contract Schedule NO1 defines the leadtime for
changes in this category to be Advanced Complex. At the time that Contract Schedule
NOI was agreed the overall leadtime for Advanced Complex changes was 30 days
however the leadtime for Advanced Complex has since been reduced to 25 days. The
overall leadtime for Advanced Complex Extended changes is 30 days and is therefore
consistent with the leadtime agreed within Contract Schedule NO1.]

System Parameters — Pure

At the Network Banking release of the Horizon system the only System Parameters
that may be amended using this category are:

MCWP
MAAWP

Amendments will be within limits defined within the Contract Schedules.
