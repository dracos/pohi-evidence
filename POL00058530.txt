About the confiscation order: what you must do next

The Court made a confiscation order against you. A copy of the order is enclosed.

The Court ordered you to pay a sum of money. This form tells you how to pay that sum, and
what may happen if you do not pay.

You must pay £40000
This sum will increase if you have to pay interest — see ‘If you do not pay as required’ on this page.

When to pay jacthn & moths I Inox tS by yf eee

Where to pay Her Majesty's Courts Service, Regional Confiscation Unit,

How to pay You may pay:
m with cash.
= with a cheque, postal order or banker's draft (this is a cheque which a bank draws on itself). Please
make it payable to: HMCS

The Regional Confiscation Unit may allow you to pay by other ways. For instance, by using a credit card,
debit card, or by allowing someone else to pay for you (called a ‘third party payment’). If you cannot use
any of these methods, please ask the Regional Confiscation Unit whether there are other ways you may pay.

If you do not pay
as required =a court may send you to prison or detention.
But if that happens, you still must pay all the money you owe because the confiscation order will
remain in force. So, if you do not pay as required, the Regional Confiscation Unit will obtain the money
from you by other means.

m= you will be required to pay more than the amount ordered by the Court.

You will have to pay interest on the amount you have not paid. The rate of interest is fixed by law.
