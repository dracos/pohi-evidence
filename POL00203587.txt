Executive Summary

Context

Post Office Limited (“POL”) is responding to allegations that the “Horizon” IT system used to record transactions in
Post Office branches is defective and that the processes associated with it are inadequate (e.g. that it may be the

source and/or cause of branch losses). POL is committed to ensuring and demonstrating that the current Horizon

system (“HNG-X”) is robust and operates with integrity, within an appropriate control framework.

Since its implementation in branches in 2010, POL has commissioned or has received an increasing number of
pieces of work relating to HNG-X to provide comfort over the design and operation of key controls. Deloitte has
been appointed to consider whether this assurance work appropriately covers key risks relating to the HNG-X
processing environment and raise suggestions for potential improvements in the assufance provision.

Our work was performed in the context of activities we see in other, similar orgafiisations, as well as guidance
offered by recognised, best practise control frameworks (for example, the g iSO ) framework, as published by The
Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission). YS / / N\ \

Our work is near completion and thus this summary outlines our emé hgh Jusions Ww 29" April 2014. Our
report, containing final conclusions, additional detail and recom, rend tion eau steps, will be issued in May.

Overall Comments

se \ ‘S
A significant amount of work has been performed radheaton to key) tisks, acioss the HNG-X processing environment.
This work is comparable to that typically seen in other, simila Rrsraaris idhs.

Specifically, the assurance provision relating to HNG- X's ger cone environment risks at Fujitsu adopts best
practises, where the risk assessment and control framework have been formalised and is independently assured
under a recognised assurance range ose 3402)... \

The significant work performed in the, areas s of imiplemeftation and specific risk is consistent with that typically
undertaken in organisations. comparable! to PO, where such risks are not required to be formally documented and
assured to comply with external govemanve requirements. POL could obtain greater assurance from this work if it
were aligned to a fopralised, ‘independently assured, risk assessment.

Governance and contrals ovehy change fisks relating to the HNG-X implementation align to expected practices
(subject to the provision Of docum yntary evidence by POL to support the verbal assertions of interviewees).

Relating to more specific risks 3 including responses to reported errors), extensive and detailed documentation has
been produced by technically competent professionals, familiar with the system, at Fujitsu. These documents
include descriptions of the key design and operating features of the HNG-X system in more specific areas and thus
contain significant information relating to controls within HNG-X. We note that the documents produced are of
system and operational nature, and, whilst consistent with organisations like POL that are not subject to external
compliance requirements in this area, would provide greater comfort over the complete coverage of key risks if
supplemented from a risk assessed lens.

Our main recommendation for improvement in the assurance provision therefore would be for POL to extend the
formal risk and control framework, already in place for general controls, to also embrace key risks and controls
holistically across the HNG-X processing environment. For example, to include controls in specific risk and thus
more operational areas of the business, such as the Finance Service Centre.

This exercise would provide a fully encompassing and coherent risk and control framework for the HNG-X
processing environment, and give a platform from which POL can deliver more comprehensive, efficient and
sustainable comfort that key processing environment risks are being managed on an ongoing basis.

Such an enhanced approach would also enable POL to formally optimise the design of the control framework
against POL’s emerging risk appetite definitions and take forward the more granular improvement suggestions
contained in our report. For example, the need for POL to formalise its response to the ISAE 3402 “User Entity
Control Considerations”, which POL has recently started to document.

Key Emerging Findings

We structured our work around 3 main areas of risk and have aligned our more detailed, emerging findings to
these:

IT Environment Risks: >

/

IT Environment Risks relate to the policies and procedures which support thé day to‘day running of the system,
such as security management, change control management and system 9, erations matragement. Controls which
mitigate these risks are often referred to as “General Computer Co; WA /OuNwork fcyssed on assurance
provided over Fujitsu's activities in these areas.

Formally structured and independent assurance work has been forge rela ing to these “Tisks, in line with

benchmarks for an outsourced IT processing environment suchas HNG:

POL's assurance over key risks in this area could be stré igthened Byeot inppleting its formal response to “user

entity control considerations” of the ISAE 3402 reportand by Suggesting ‘some refinements to the narratives within
the ISAE 3402 to provide further clarity in certain, potential. ambiguotis reas (examples are in our final report).

HNG-X Implementation Change Risks:

HNG-X Implementation Change Pik ‘S relate to the very Significant IT changes that required formal project
governance structures when HNG- implemented ‘hese risks are governed and controlled outside of day to
day system operating rorocedures<contrete’ which mitigaté these risks are often referred to as “Project Controls”.

The design and operation of project Qovernanda, and control procedures for the HNG-X implementation appears
comparable to what we see at other organisation’ (this is subject to the provision of evidence to support verbal
assertions made by POL inthisarea). No independent assurance has been provided in this area.

y N :

Assurance over thes implementation risks could be further strengthened through both greater independent
scrutiny and through podtimpletnentation assessment. We also note, for future reference, that such significant
projects are an opportunity ta effieiently capture and create the control and assurance frameworks for Specific
Risks (see below), and to help» ‘élarify descriptions of controls and their optimal testing once changes are live.

Specific Risks:

Specific Risks relate to those more granular or unique matters, specific to and as applied to POL’s HNG-X
processing environment, for example inherent features within the application design, required end user activities
and application enforced behaviours. ‘ Controls which mitigate these risks are often referred to as “Inherent System
Controls”, “End User Controls”, “Application Embedded Controls” and “Process Controls”. Our work focussed on
the interfaces with other systems (DVLA) and the preservation of HNG-X audit trail (Audit Store).

Substantial work has been performed over risks in this area, delivered largely by Fujitsu, in particular in areas
where reported issues have occurred in system processing. Based on the areas we have been provided, Fujitsu
have produced extensive and detailed documentation relating to the key design and operating features of the HNG-
X system, using technically competent professionals, familiar with the system.

POL00203587

In order to provide greater comfort that this work addresses all key risks, this area would benefit from being
managed, and documented, through a risk lens, potentially extending the formal risk assessment and control
framework already in place for IT Environment risks (above).

Our work relating to both the DVLA interface and the Audit Store found that the level of understanding
demonstrated through system documentation appeared comprehensive, and that key controls were referenced
within that documentation (such as the use of ‘tamper proof" IT infrastructure). The documentation has not however
been produced from a risk assessed perspective, that would then support more evidenced based, independent
verification of these key control features and attestations.

Such a formalisation exercise would not only give greater assurance over specific risks, but would also enable a
more automated and thus efficient control design to be considered (for example, more automated controls and
further proactive monitoring / alerting to key risk events).

Other matters:

We observed that the risk appetite of POL is yet to be defined, though we understand that an exercise is underway
with the ARC to achieve this. We consider this to be an important exercise for POLMto perform, as it will help

\ A
underpin and better optimise the design of your control and cenuraney jisreee (above) in the future.

We also note that POL's use of Internal Audit could be extended haptoys théyprovision of further comfort over
specific risk areas. Internal Audit have covered some aspects of, these tisk in-parallel with their work on IT
Environment risks, for example, the operation of interfaces to POLSAP, bat there is opportunity for this to be
extended — for example, system interfaces to Crosenezans controls Yelating tg adjustment postings.
