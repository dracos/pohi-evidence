Planned ‘Key’ Counter Activity

e Asix terminal office installed and migrated via MiECCO.

¢ Business as usual transactions all other outlets.

¢ Introduction of new non-core product (‘Model Office Bus Ticket’ ) at
three specified outlets.

¢ BES Recovery

e Simulated ISDN failure

Actual ‘Key’ Counter Activity

¢ MiECCO migration was completed successfully at Watford. Delays arising
from the application of Work Packages following installation resulted in
the migration activity completing after the end-of-day processes had
occured,

¢ 43 incidents were raised throughout the day, in the following areas;

e nearly half were procedural issues, which underlines a general
concern on the content and presentation of the User Guides
provided for MOT.

¢ Two BES issues were identified. The Casual Agent encashment
issues of yesterday progressed, with some  encashments
successfully completed and some being disallowed. Further
investigation is underway. A new incident was raised regarding
the 30 minute lockout enforced at a nominated outlet, when a

Management to confirm the design in this area
e The remaining incidents were largely attributed to the content of
various counter and office reports not being displayed correctly

Overnight Processing
¢ Overnight processes ran without incident

Planned Interface Activity

¢ TIP - Transaction files from Pathway

¢ CAPS - Change of Circs., Payment, Batch Stop files and Automatic card
requests from CAPS to Pathway. Encashments and card request
confirmations from Pathway to CAPS.

¢ OBCS - transaction files delivered from Pathway for 6 outlets

¢ POCL RDP - No activity planned

¢ HAPS - transactions polled from existing legacy equipment and Horizon
APS

Actual Interface Activity

e TIP - Reconciliation of day 6 & 7 transactions underway, but being
hampered due to the fact the a large amount of counter activity has been
performed after the end-of-day cut-off markers have been applied. The
transaction file for day 8 has been rejected. Investigation continues...

¢ CAPS - All Online and Batch activity completed on schedule. However,
an issue was raised (regarding stop files) which required urgent
attention by Pathway overnight. Pathway have requested that CAPS
resource is available to assist in this investigation activity. Lesley Finnigan
to confirm.

¢ OBCS - Transaction files up to day 8 received. 3 unexpected results are
under investigation. One can be attributed to the fact that the OBCS
service is unavailable at our Northern Ireland test configuration. We had
planned test scheduled at this outlet.

¢ HAPS - The issue that prevented successful file transfer/reconciliation
has been identified and actions have been applied to resolve the problem
(raised initially as E-9902250006 and followed up by E-9902240015). The
day 7 transaction file has been received. Due to the difficulties
experienced in receiving files, reconciliation with expected results for day
6, 7 & 8 will be performed during day 9. HAPS have identified that no
APS Reports have been received from BSU. Further investigation is

underway

Failed test conditions are reflected by Incidents raised, i.e;
e the OBCS service is not available at the Northern Ireland outlet
¢ attempted Casual Agent Encashments

Test conditions not run were due to;

¢ a number of script errors (i.e. attempting ‘by user’ reports and stamp
declarations on an individual stock unit)

© wrong access levels prevented a number of activities (again, error in script
schedule).
