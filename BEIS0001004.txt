Subject: Stalled cases

Dear Sir,

Firstly thank you for reaching out and asking for anyone with stalled cases to contact
you directly.
It's certainly refreshing.
I don’t know if you remember but in 2020 you mentioned my family and I in the House of
Commons. I was very grateful.
You explained to the Minister at the time that I remained in bankruptcy and my case
against me in 2006 still stood after the outcome of the GLO in 2019.
At the time Paul Marshall, had written extensively about the wrongs of the original
Judgement against me.
(Paul is now acting for me with respect to compensation.)
This led to a story being published in the FT and your questions in the House.
It saddens me greatly to now tell you, as Minister, that I am still in bankruptcy and the
original case against me has not yet been set aside.
After 15 years of bankruptcy and no creditors in my bankruptcy I am still unable to
receive an interim payment to ease my problems.
BEIS accept that am entitled to an interim payment but will not pay it to me as there is
no agreement with my trustee that I should receive it.
I must point out that I have no creditors in my bankruptcy. None.
My trustee explained to me that at the time, it might be in my interest to not be
discharged from bankruptcy.
I hope that you may be able to make some headway in working out what I need to do in
order for me to move on and receive this interim payment.
I seem to have hit a brick wall with the interim payment.
