Belinda,

The Andy Winn/Alan Lusher e-mail doesn't ring a bell with me either. Would you confirm which case is Ward and if
it's one we already have the CQR for I'll ask Kath and Shirley whether they've seen this e-mail.

Thanks
Angela

Please see below. Not yet decided about whether to postpone this week's WG call but does anyone know
anything about the email being quoted below about remote alteration of figures in branch? I think that this is
a new one on me.

Andy P, can we please chase CK for a response on the Rose report point.

Best wishes
Belinda

Dear Ron,

As Priti has stated in her last sentence we are seeking a stay on the time limits on all cases under review due to the
implications of POL's non-disclosure of system-generated transactions and Horizon's integrity issues.

The 'Helen Rose Report' is of critical significance to all cases. The information contained within it is a compelling
case for such a stay in its own right. When combined with the Andy Winn/Alan Lusher email in the case of Ward
which explicitly states that Fujitsu can remotely change the figures in the branches without the SPMs' knowledge
or authority, the case for a general stay is overwhelming.

We ask that the Working Party considers this request as a matter of urgency In order that we do not prejudice our
clients' cases by omitting what is clearly information of the utmost general significance,.

We also request that the Working Party demands that POL acts quickly to provide the information requested in
Priti's email immediately so that the mediation process is not hindered further.

Regards

Steve Darlington BA (Hons) ACA
