I am finalising the chronology. In the course of reviewing the papers, I have come across a report prepared by Graham.
Brander (the Investigation Manager) to Juliet McFarlane (in-house lawyer dealing with the prosecution) which may go
some way to explaining why the significant declared cash holdings were not noted immediately.

The Report states that this branch did not have an Over Night Cash Holding (ONCH) target. The cash requirement was
determined by an automated system. This system plans the branch's cash needs based on usage. In the event that the
branch was holding too much money, an automated message would have been sent to the Horizon terminal. This does
not appear as “pop-up” on the screen, but would need to be accessed by the user. This may explain why the issue did not
come to anyone's attention until March 2006.
