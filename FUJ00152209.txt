1.0 Introduction

The Network Banking Prosecution Support Service has been introduced in response to
Network Banking Requirements 260 and 315. The scope of the Service is outlined in Schedule
NOI of the Codified Agreement in the Section entitled “Information Retrieval and Audit”.

This document is intended to assist the management and delivery of the service necessary to
support Post Office Ltd in respect of criminal prosecution or civil litigation for the Horizon
solution.

It is intended that the management of prosecution support process is generic for all services.
Audit Record Query requests are received, documented, extracted from the Audit Archive and
progressed to resolution in the same manner. The production of evidence and witness
statements in support of prosecution also utilises the same processes.

This document is without prejudice to any of the parties and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed or construed as affecting contractual obligations or creating new contractual
obligations between any of the parties.

2.0 Scope

This document sets out the procedures to be adopted by Post Office account’s Prosecution
Support Section (PSS) for managing and dealing with Audit Record Queries for Investigation
and Prosecution support purposes including the:

© Undertaking of Audit Record Queries;

¢ Presentation of Transaction records extracted by Audit Record Queries;

e Analysis of appropriate records and logs;

¢ Preparation of witness statements of fact in relation to Audit Record Queries;

e Attendance at Court by relevant employees to give evidence in respect of witness
statements;

e Undertaking of additional litigation/prosecution support activities as may be requested on
a case-by-case basis on the instruction of Legal Counsel.

It is recognised that it is not possible to deliver a standardised response to all prosecution
related Audit Record Queries. The type of information requested for an Audit Record Query
is heavily dependent upon the requirements of the particular case in question and the demands
of the Legal System. These procedures therefore provide a flexible approach to the provision
of prosecution support.

ARQs in support of potential prosecution will be obtained solely from the Horizon System
Audit Archive / Server. The method by which the integrity of this data is protected is
described in the Audit Trail Functional Specification. Evidence in support of data integrity will
be sourced from Audit Archive / Server and Post Office account Business logs. All access to
audit data is restricted to named individuals via dedicated workstations located in a secure
environment. This is consistent with the security controls employed for the existing service.
Supporting evidence is sourced from relevant business records and logs.

Requests for Information will fall into two general categories:
a Audit Record Query only.

This involves the extraction from the audit archive of records relating to data for a
particular outlet.

a Audit Record Query plus associated witness statement.

This involves the extraction for the audit archive of records relating to data for a particular
outlet plus the provision of a witness statement of fact in support of the data extracted.

This document and the limits on Audit Record Queries and Search Criteria it contains relate to
information retrievals and audit for the Network Banking System and the Existing Service.
The Existing Service ceases to be applicable 18 calendar months after Network Banking Pilot

(Soft Launch). This document and the limits set out in this document will be updated at this
time to reflect the removal of the Existing Service.

Provision of prosecution support for the existing service has been agreed under contract.
Prior to Network Banking contract signing this provision was supported under a CR received
to request such a facility. Provision of the old format data retrieval support service before
contract signing was based upon an informal agreement between the Director of Horizon
Commercial and the Director of Post Office account Quality. CCN 759, submitted to
formalise this agreement was not subsequently ratified. The agreement provided for the
provision of up to 50 audit data extractions per annum for audit and security purposes, with a
maximum of 7 in any calendar month. The annual target measured over a rolling 12 month
period. Additional extractions were catered for on the basis of Time and Material costs
equivalent to 1.5 days at senior consultant rate.

The provision of prosecution support (specifically the provision of witness statements of fact)
was similarly not formalised and was provided on a “without prejudice subject to contract”
basis pending the receipt of the aforementioned Change Request. Prosecution support for the
existing system is now provided as part of the Prosecution Support Service. This document
outlines the operational approach to this service.

This document does not cover the requirements or procedures for the Data Reconciliation
Service i.e. Banking Transaction Record Queries which are handled by BSU.

3.0 Audit Record Queries
3.1 Scope

An Audit Record Query is an extraction from the Audit Archive of records relating to
Transactions, which meet specific search criteria. Audit Record Queries may be undertaken to
provide transaction and other details required to facilitate an investigation or in support of
prosecution.

Through out this document the generic term to Audit Record Query is used collectively to
refer to an extraction of data from the Audit Archive. There are three types of Audit Record
Query as defined under contract:

“Audit Record Query” means a Record Query, which is not a Banking Transaction Record
Query and which relates to Transactions.

“Record Query” the extraction of records created after commencement of Network Banking
Pilot (Soft Launch) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 7.3 in NOI relating to Banking
Transactions (and, in the case of Audit Record Queries relating to all Transactions) meeting
the Search Criteria, such extraction being limited to specific types of information/data fields.

“Old Format Query” the extraction of records created before commencement of Network
Banking Pilot (Soft Launch) relating to Transactions (other than Banking Transactions)
meeting the Search Criteria, such extraction being limited to the following specific types of
information/data fields.

3.2 Limits on Audit Record Queries.

The number of Audit Record Queries requested by Post Office Ltd in connection with
investigation or prosecution shall be the first to be met per year of;

¢ no more than 720 queries ( old and new) or

« 15,000 query days on a rolling year basis

With no more than the first to be met in any calendar month of
e 60 queries (old and new) or

e 1250 query days.

Any Audit Record Queries over and above the 720 maximum will be rolled-over to the next
12-month period and count towards the total for the next year.

Post Office may at any time on three months’ notice vary the aggregate limits of Audit Record
Queries which Fujitsu Services is required to carry out between

a) the limits specified in paragraph 3.2; and

3.3. Search Criteria

The search criteria for Audit Record Queries in support of prosecution are either:

(a) Date or dates (not exceeding 31 consecutive days), time-range, Outlet and PAN (or

Individual dates or multiple date ranges can be accommodated provided that the maximum
number of days requested does not exceed 31 consecutive days for each Audit Record Query.

Audit Record Query or Audit Record Queries from the agreed annual maximum will be
required to facilitate the request. Additional Audit Record Queries will be required for each
subsequent period of 31 consecutive days or part thereof. Multiple Audit Record Queries for
prosecution will equate to faster consumption of the maximum Audit Record Queries per year.

Each Audit Record Query shall relate only to an individual Outlet.
Audit Record Queries are limited to specific types of information/data fields these are:
the ID for the user logged-on,
Counter Position ID,
stock unit reference,

6.0 Management Process

6.1 Allocation of Audit Record Queries

Post Office account Prosecution Support Manager shall allocate and monitor all requests
within PSS. Allocation will be determined on current workloads of each member of PSS.
Each individual in the section has the responsibility for updating their log daily. This will
ensure an even spread of workload across PSS, making sure all requests are completed in
accordance with agreed time scales. Status of Audit Record Queries shall be maintained in the
Prosecution Support Database.

6.1.1 Continuity of Evidence

One member of PSS will generally undertake the entire end to end prosecution support
process (as detailed in section 7.0). This enables one individual to attest to all elements of the
retrieval process and facilitate provision of a single witness statement thereby minimising
service impact.

6.2 Prosecution Support Database

The Database shall track all work carried out, by date and time, on every Audit Record Query.
The database shall be used for allocating requests and tracking the request through the audit
extraction process. An audit trail of date and time of processes carried out on the Horizon
Audit System is recorded by Audit Record Query unique identifier on the Extractor Client
GUL. Date and time of exporting messages to excel, details of anti virus checks used, date and
time of burning to CD and posting shall not be recorded on the Extractor Client GUI. These
shall be recorded in the Prosecution Support Database.

6.3 Process for Cancellations

Once an identifier has been attached to a request it shall not be reused even if the request is
later withdrawn. This ensures the integrity of the request log for requests that require
prosecution support at the time of request or at a future date. The log shall also ensure that
Post Office Ltd and Post Office account meet contractual requirements on the number of
requests and the turn around of requests.

7A2 Create Audit trail of request

The Horizon Audit System provides an audit trail. The audit trail records the date and time of
every process carried out on the Horizon Audit System to complete each Audit Record Query.
The search criteria and Audit Record Query identifier shall be used to create the directory
structure of each audit trail. An audit trail is produced only when an Audit Record Query is
marked as completed on the Extractor Client. (The audit trail is not the Prosecution Support
Database). The Prosecution Support Database holds information on when the Audit Record
Query is received, the search criteria and whether any Audit Record Queries are cancelled

The Prosecution Support Database is used to monitor workloads and ensure Audit Record
Queries are completed in a timely fashion. The audit trail is used to attest to the integrity of
data held on the Horizon Audit System and data extracted for Audit Record Queries.

7A Search for files required to complete request

A search for files required to complete the request shall then be initiated using the audit
extractor GUI.

71.4 Select and retrieve files

Once the search has completed and returned the results each required file shall be marked for
selection and then selection will be initiated. Files extracted to the server shall be seal checked
as they are extracted. This check is intended to confirm that the data has not been altered
from the time the transaction first originated to the time it was stored. After the files have been
extracted the operator shall check the seal status and ensure all seals match.

TAS Generate message store

A message store of the selected files shall be initiated on the operator’s local machine using
the files extracted to the audit server.

7.1.6 Rquery to spreadsheet

Once the message store has been successfully generated, the Rquery tool shall be used to
select the files as per the search criteria set out in the Audit Record Query. (VB: Banking
Transaction details are still in refinement and until documentation is prepared on Network
Banking Transaction data, data attributes available cannot be identified. When
documentation is available Post Office Ltd. Casework Manager and Post Office account PSS
Manager shall agree requirements).

The Transaction records extracted for the Audit Record Query shall be exported by the
Rquery tool to an Excel 95 Format or native format if requested

Sensitive Data included in records of Banking transactions are held in encrypted form by the
Network Banking System. Therefore, sensitive data included in a Audit Record Query will be
provided to Post Office Ltd. Casework Manager in its encrypted form. Post Office account
will not be supplying any decryption routes.

TAT Burn closed CD

Once the data is complete and formatted it shall be burnt to ‘closed’ CD-W along with a word
document that shall provide an explanation of the format in which the data is provided. The
CD-W will be labelled with the Audit Record Query reference number, the Fad name and
code, the due date, name of Fujitsu employee who compiled the data and date compilation
was completed, the date range requested and the name of the Fujitsu employee who checked
the data on the CD. The audit trail will complete date and times of access and events and
record seal check values. The audit trail is saved as a text file to the user directory on the audit
server.

7.18 Virus check

The word document that is attached to the CD shall also contain reference to the anti virus
software used to check the CD. It shall state the engine and virus definition files used. The
CD shall be checked for viruses after the data has been written to it and before sending it to
Post Office Ltd. In order to adopt ‘best practice’ processes all data retrieval completed by Security
Department staff is to be checked by another prior to despatch. (See IA PRO 004 12.0 for details).

719 Despatch

The CD shall be sent to Casework Manager by Special Delivery. Appropriate packaging for
the CD will be used to help protect against damage in transit.

Files extracted to the audit server shall then be closed in order for the next Audit Record
Query to be undertaken. The message store on the operator’s local workstation shall be
cleared of messages.

7.2 Prosecution Support

7.21 Check Horizon System Helpdesk Logs

Problems or faults at a Post Office outlet logged with the Horizon System Helpdesk will be
examined using the search criteria specified in an Audit Record Query to assess whether the
outlet was functioning effectively.

The logs are accessed through the web-based program, Powerhelp. All PSS members shall
have access to Powerhelp. They shall use the specified outlet and date range as requested in
the Audit Record Query search criteria to search Powerhelp for any calls logged for the outlet
in the date range required. The log of calls to the Horizon System Helpdesk detail incidents of
error, inaccuracy or malfunction pertaining to the sites, equipment, services and individuals
concerned.

7.2.2 Analysis Non-polling reports

Non-polling reports shall be reviewed for the outlet in question, for all days within the date
range specified, to identify if the outlet in question had any problems receiving polls. Non-
polled reports are stored by date. The file consists of all non-polls for a particular day. For
the date range in question, the reports with the corresponding date shall be retrieved and
searched through, by outlet. This will ensure whether during the date range in question the
outlet received all polls.

7.2.3 Analysis of Fault logs

Any relevant PinICLs identified in Powerhelp logs will be reviewed through Peak to identify
any recorded faults, that might affect the integrity or admissibility of the audit archive from
which the Audit Record Queries are extracted.

The Peak log will detail the error relating to the site, equipment and or service in question.

7.24 Complete Witness Statement of Fact

PSS will provide a witness statement of fact in respect of 250 Audit Record Queries per
annum. This will as far as possible be undertaken by the person responsible for the actioning
of the work at 7.1 so as to retain continuity of evidence and obviate the need for additional
statements.

7.2.4.1 Witness Statement of Fact

Any material or otherwise pertinent information shall be recorded and included in the relevant
witness statement of fact.

Requirements for witness statements explaining the extraction of audit data from Horizon in
response to an Audit Record Query shall be completed by the individual from PSS who

8.0 Additional Prosecution Support

There may be occasions when information is requested which exceeds that provided for as
part of the standard Prosecution Support Service. This shall be dealt with on a case by case
basis and in accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

8.1 Audit Record Queries

ARQ retrievals beyond that specified under contract shall be agreed on a case-by-case basis
and shall be dealt with in accordance with Change Control Procedures.

8.2 Expert Witness Statement

To offer all the available evidence without it being requested would only serve to flood the
courtroom with documentation. For this reason expert in depth analysis and detailed “expert”
witness statements (as opposed to witness statements of fact) are rarely required.

It is however conceivable that, given the size and complexity of the Horizon system, the
integrity of the witness statements of fact may be challenged by Defence Counsel in order to
discredit a prosecution. In these cases additional, granular detail about the technical working
and integrity of various systems that constitute the Horizon system may be required if only for
“unused material”.

Expert witnesses could comprise anyone within Post Office account or its approved
contractors who could be called upon to provide and testify to this additional evidence.

Expert witnesses could be called upon to provide for example:

a Operational logs and shift hand over documentation to demonstrate consistent operation
and availability of the service;

a Secure NT, Dynix and SecurID definitions;
a Details of information flows throughout the system;

a Details of cryptographic key controls and other confidentiality, integrity and availability
issues;

a Provision of specific Tivoli and other system security event files;
a Subsequent analysis of this data.

Whilst this type of detail is specifically excluded from the standard evidential requirements
included at paragraphs 7.2.1 to 7.2.4, Post Office account will endeavour to provide support
of this granular level of evidence on an agreed case by case basis and shall be dealt with in
accordance with the Change Control Procedure. The production of this evidence shall not be
subject to the time-scales at 7.3 but Post Office account shall use reasonable endeavours to
meet dates notified by Post Office for the production of this material.

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL Pathway Ltd., for ????
months as an Information Technology (IT) Security Analyst responsible for audit data extractions and IT
Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a computerised.
accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions
of audit data held on the Horizon system and to obtain information regarding system transaction

information processed on the Horizon system.
B

Within each Post Office, there are counter positions which each have a computer terminal, a visual display
unit and a keyboard and printer. This individual system records all transactions input by the counter clerk
working at that counter position. Each clerk logs on to the system by using their own unique password.
The transactions performed by each clerk, and the associated cash and stock level information are

recorded by the computer system in a stock unit. Once logged on, any transactions performed by the clerk

must be recorded and entered on the computer and are accounted for within the user's allocated stock unit.
Cc

The Horizon system provides a number of daily and weekly records of all transactions input into it. It
enables Post Office users to obtain computer summaries for individual clients of Post Office Limited e.g.
National Savings Bank, Girobank, Driving Vehicle Licence Agency and the Department of Working
Pensions (DWP). The Horizon system also enables the clerk to produce a weekly balance of cash and

stock on hand combined with the other transactions performed in that accounting period.
D

Where local reports are required these are accessed from an icon on the desktop menu. The user is
presented with a parameter driven menu, which enables the report to be customised to requirements. The
report is then populated from transaction data that is held in the local database and is printed out on the
tally roll printer. The system also allows for information to be transferred to the main accounting

department at Chesterfield in order for the office accounts to be balanced.
E

The Post Office counter processing functions are provided through a series of counter applications: the
Order Book Control Service (OBCS) that ascertains the validity of DWP order books before payment is
made; the Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS) that enables Postmasters to conduct general retail
trade at the counter and sell products on behalf of their clients; the Automated Payments Service (APS)
provides support for utility companies and others who provide incremental in-payment mechanisms based
on the use of cards and other tokens and the Logistics Feeder Service (LFS) which supports the
management of cash and value stock movements to and from the outlet, principally to minimise cash held
overnight in outlets. The counter desktop service and the office platform service on which it runs provides.
various common functions for transaction recording and settlement as well as user access control and

session management.
F

Information from counter transactions is written into a local database and then replicated automatically to
databases on all other counters within a Post Office outlet. The information is then forwarded over ISDN
(or other communication service) to databases on a set of central Correspondence Servers at the Fujitsu

Services data centres. This is undertaken by a messaging transport system within the Transaction

Management Service (TMS). Various systems then transfer information to Central Servers that control the
flow of information to various support services. Details of outlet transactions are normally sent at least
daily via the system. Details relating to the outlet's stock holding and cash account are sent weekly. Details
are then forwarded daily via a file transfer service to the Post Office accounting department at Chesterfield

and also, where appropriate, to other Post Office Clients.
G

An audit of all information handled by the TMS is taken daily by copying all new messages to archive
media. This creates a record of all original outlet transaction details including its origin - outlet and
counter, when it happened, who caused it to happen and the outcome. The TMS journal is maintained at
each of the Fujitsu Services Data Centre sites and is created by securely replicating all transaction records
that occurred in every Outlet. They therefore provide the ability to compare the audit track record of the
same transaction recorded in two places to verify that systems were operating correctly. All exceptions are

investigated and reconciled. Records of all transactions are written to audit archive media.

The Order Book Control System (OBCS) software, linked to the Horizon system was developed in
conjunction with the DWP. OBCS provides details of DWP order books on the national stop payment list,
and, enables data regarding the movement of order books, and, encashments to be captured on their behalf.
Each Horizon terminal at a Post Office counter has access to the national stop list through OBCS, when a
barcoded DWP order book is scanned at the Post Office counter, or the order book details are manually
keyed into Horizon at the Post Office counter. Each night, the national stop payment list is updated from
information supplied electronically from the DWP computer centre. National stop payment list data is held
centrally within the Horizon system, and is available to all Post Offices. However, certain information from
the national stop payment list is also downloaded to individual Post Offices for faster access; this download
process is called polling. The polling of individual Post Offices also involves receiving details of order
book movements and encashments at Post Offices, centrally within Horizon, for onward transmission to the
DWP.

K

I have access to reports that monitor faults, polling failures, equipment failures and calls for advice and
guidance logged by the Horizon System Helpdesk. During the ??? to ??? , there were ?? calls from name
& fad code to the Helpdesk. None of these calls relate to faults which would have had an effect on the

integrity of the information held on the system.
L

When information relating to individual transactions is requested, the data is extracted from the audit
archive media via the Audit Workstations (AW’s). Information is presented in exactly the same way as the
data held in the archive although it can be filtered depending upon the type of information requested. The
integrity of audit data is guaranteed at all times from its origination, storage and retrieval to subsequent
despatch to the requester. Controls have been established that provide assurances to Post Office Internal

Audit (POIA) that this integrity is maintained.
During audit data extractions the following controls apply :

1. Extractions can only be made through the AWs, which exist at Fujitsu Services, Forest Road, Feltham,
Middlesex, Fujitsu Services, Lovelace Lane, Bracknell, Berkshire and the two Fujitsu Services Data
Centres. These are all subject to rigorous physical security controls appropriate to that location.

Specifically, the Feltham and Bracknell AWs — where most extractions take place — are located in a

2. Logical access to the AW and its functionality is managed in accordance with the Fujitsu Services, Post
Office Account Security Policy and the principles of ISO 17799. This includes dedicated Logins,

password control and the use of Microsoft Windows NT security features.

3. All extraction’s are logged on the AW and supported by documented Audit Record Queries (ARQ’s),

authorised by nominated persons within Post Office Ltd. This log can be scrutinised on the AW.
4. Extractions are only made by authorised individuals.

5. Upon receipt of an ARQ from Post Office Ltd they are interpreted by CS Security. The details are
checked and the printed request filed.

6. The required files are identified and marked using the dedicated audit tools.

7. Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to audit archive media and re-

calculated when the files are retrieved.

8. To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the audit archive media the checksum seal for the file
is re-calculated by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the original value calculated when the file

was originally written to the audit archive media. The result is maintained in a Check Seal Table.
9. The specific ARQ details are used to obtain the specific data.

was not such as to effect the information held on it. I hold a responsible position in relation to the working

of the computer.
