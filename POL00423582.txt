Summary of Whistleblowing reports received 2018-19

The whistleblowing reports have not identified any route cause which may indicate a
systemic problem. However, some investigations have led to further issues being
identified at branches and appropriate corrective action has been taken. This includes
temporary suspensions of Postmasters.

There have been numerous reports submitted by and about employees at a specific
non-customer facing location, and each report has been investigated independently.
This trend has been raised with the appropriate HR representative to investigate if
there are any underlying root causes or issues at this location.

e¢ 43 whistleblowing reports were received and 31 cases were closed.

e¢ The majority of the allegations were about Postmasters or Agent Assistants (22
reports). There were 10 reports made about Post Office employees.

e There has been an increase in anonymous reports being submitted, with most
anonymous reports being about employees (8) or postmasters (9). There has also
been an increase Agent Assistants submitting reports about their Postmaster.

Summary of EU Whistleblowing Directive April 2019

Background:
Following a number of global corporate scandals such as the Panama Papers and
Volkswagen’s infamous “‘diesel-gate’, uncovered by whistle-blowers, the European
Commission (the Commission) ratified new EU laws on 16** April 2019 to strengthen
the protection of whistle-blowers. The directive will be implemented across the 28
countries by May 2021.

Key Elements

e Defines a whistleblower in Article 3(9) as ‘a natural or legal person who reports or
discloses information on breaches acquired in the context of his or her work-
related activities’. This definition is deliberately broad to encompass not only
employees but also shareholders, volunteers, job applicants, non-executive
directors, self-employed workers and contractors.

e Introduces a whistleblower regulator in member countries

e Requires a tiered reporting mechanism across all industry sectors and within both
private companies and public institutions with 3 or 6 month response timeframes.

e Sets out the framework for protection against dismissal and other forms of
retaliation from an employer against a whistleblowing employee.

e Sets out protection afforded to whistle-blowers against retaliatory behaviour from
their employers, such as demotion, transfers of duties or location, reduction of
salary or hours, disciplinary or financial penalties, discrimination and termination of
contract.

e Introduces the concept of the ‘reverse burden of proof’, which places the burden
upon an employer to demonstrate that they did not act in retaliation where
retaliatory behaviour is alleged. In cases of retaliation, the whistle-blower will be
entitled to remedies in order to prevent workplace harassment or dismissal, in
addition to access to free advice.

e Whistle-blowers will be afforded the right to an effective remedy and fair trial, the
presumption of innocence, and the right of defence. If the whistle-blower made the
report in good faith to public authorities or media in a lawful way, they will be
exempt from liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information
imposed by contract, such as employment agreement, or by law.

The Whistleblowing Directive ensures protection for whistleblowers reporting
breaching lof EU legislation in the fields of:
o public procurement
financial services
money laundering and terrorist financing
product, transport, food and nuclear safety
environmental protection
animal health and welfare
public health
consumer protection
protection privacy, data protection and security of network and information

Tier One: Internal reporting within organisation—the first stage of the reporting
process is for an employee to make a whistleblowing report to their employers
using internal reporting channels and the Directive imposes a three- or six-
month response timeframe, dependent upon the complexity of the issue. The
first line of reporting may be omitted, however, if the whistle-blower has
grounds to believe that an internal report could jeopardise any subsequent
investigation.

Tier Two: External reporting to the competent national authorities—this second
stage of reporting is to be utilised where internal reporting processes are not
available or in the absence of a satisfactory response to an internal report. In
such circumstances, whistle-blowing employees should report to the central
state authorities and, where relevant, EU bodies.

Tier Three: Public/media reporting—as a final resort, the whistle-blower can
disclose the information directly to the media if the employer or the public
authorities have taken no timely action, or if the breach must be disclosed
immediately due to an imminent danger to the public interest.

UK impact

The current legislative framework governing whistle-blowing in the UK was introduced
by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA 1998), which came into force in
1999. PIDA 1998 amended the Employment Rights Act 1996 (ERA 1996) to protect
workers who blow the whistle not only for personal gain, but also in the public
interest.

The new EU Directive is expected to be transposed into UK law and will plug some
gaps in ERA 1996:

°

the definition of ‘worker’ under the Directive extends to a wider group of
people, even including individuals who have not yet commenced employment or
those that are going through the recruitment process.

widens the scope of reporting and offers protections to those who make reports
directly to the media, something not guaranteed under ERA 1996.

imposes obligations on organisations to have a whistle-blowing policy in place
and to respond to whistleblowing issues in a timely manner, which is not a
requirement under ERA 1996.
