3. General approach to settlements under the Scheme

This section sets out the methodology for monitoring and scoping the overall
costs and outcomes of settlements under the Scheme.

Settlement Principles

3.1

3.2
3.3

3.4

A set of Settlement Principles will be drawn up that will guide the approach
to settling each Complaint.

The Settlement Principles will be set out in this Policy — see section 5
The Settlement Principles will be reviewed regularly.

The Principles will be revised as necessary to address any changes in:
3.4.1. the Scheme

3.4.2 the number/nature of the Complaints

3.4.3 past mediations or settlements

3.4.4 The Outcome Assessment (see below)

Fix the number of complaints

3.5

3.6

3.7

Applications by Applicants to the Scheme must be received by 18
November 2013.

Following the application deadline, the total number of applications will be
known but the value of any complaints may still be unclear.

An initial review and assessment of the complaints will be undertaken at
this stage applying the Settlement Principles to test the efficacy of the
Principles in practice.

Value the complaints

3.8

3.9

3.10

On receipt of an Applicant's applications and case questionnaire, Second
Sight will work with Post Office to investigate the Complaint.

This investigation should produce greater clarity as to the types of
settlement and compensation being sought by Applicants.

This information will be regularly reviewed to assess the possible outcome
and costs of settlements under the Scheme (the Outcome Assessment).

Set Settlement Parameters

3.11

3.12

Following the investigation phase, it should be possible to separately
assess the merits of each Complaint and produce a Recommendation for
Settlement (see section 4 below)

The Recommendations for Settlement will be reviewed holistically on a
regular basis and used to further update the Outcome Assessment.

Mediation

3.13

3.14

3.15

At mediation, a settlement will be sought within the parameters of the
Recommendation for Settlement.

The result of any Mediation (whether or not there is a settlement) will be
communicated to all internal key stakeholders.

The results of any mediations will be reviewed holistically on a regular
basis and used to further update the Outcome Assessment.

Reporting

3.16

The updated Outcome Assessment will be presented to the Steering Group
on a regular basis for their consideration.

4. Process for considering individual complaints

This section sets out the process for handling and trying to resolve each
individual Complaint.

Background

4.1 Following the investigation into a specific Complaint, the Working Group
will take a decision on whether the case is suitable for mediation.

4.2 Mediation is a consensual process so even if the Working Group decides
that a case is suitable for mediation, Post Office is not required to mediate
(though there may be negative consequences in refusing to do so).

4.3 It may be that some cases can be resolved before mediation through direct
engagement with the Applicant — see Direct Engagement at Section 6.

44 If asettlement is agreed through mediation, the mediator is likely to insist
that the parties sign a settlement agreement on the day of the mediation.

4.5 Those persons attending mediation (or engaging directly with an Applicant)

on behalf of Post Office therefore need a clear mandate as to the nature
and scope of any settlement that might be offered.

Suitability for mediation

46

Following the investigation into a specific Complaint but before the
Working Group decides whether a case is suitable for mediation, POL
Legal will, in consultation with other internal stakeholders, advise on
whether POL should:

4.6.1 Vote against mediation at the Working Group and refuse to
mediate even if the Working Group votes in favour of mediation.

46.2 Vote against mediation at the Working Group but allow mediation
to proceed if the Working Group votes in favour of mediation.

46.3 Vote in favour of mediation at the Working Group.

Recommendation for Settlement

48

49

4.10

4.12

If POL wishes to attempt to settle a Complaint (by mediation or direct
engagement), the Complaint and the investigation findings will be internally
reviewed in order to produce a Recommendation for Settlement.

Where the Applicant has been subject to a criminal conviction, the
investigation findings will be sent to POL's prosecution team to ensure that
Post Office is complying with its prosecution duties (in particular, its on-
going disclosure duties).

POL Legal (or external counsel) will be responsible for leading the process
of producing the Recommendation for Settlement in order to ensure that
legal privilege is preserved. The Recommendation for Settlement will
recommend:

4.10.1 Whether Post Office should attempt to resolve the Complaint
before mediation?

4.10.2 Whether offering an apology would be appropriate?

4.10.3 Possible settlement options (which may include a recommendation
that no settlement should be offered and/or that Post Office should
express regret for any distressed caused to the Applicant).

4.10.4 If compensation is an appropriate settlement option, the financial
limits for a compensation payment.

Internal stakeholders will be consulted as appropriate on the
Recommendation for Settlement.

The Recommendation for Settlement will be revised and finalised by POL
Legal (or external counsel) and the communications team.

Approval to settle

4.13

The Recommendation for Settlement will be considered by Charles
Colquhoun (or a suitable alternative person nominated by Charles) who
will:

Settlement Principles and this Settlement Policy.

4.13.2 Ensure that the Recommendation for Settlement is consistent with
the approach adopted in other Complaints.

4.13.3. Approve or propose changes to the Recommendation for
Settlement.

A mandate will be issued to those attending mediation or engaging directly
with Applicants confirming that they may settle the Complaint within the
scope of the approved Recommendation for Settlement.

Mediation

4.15

4.16

417

The attendees for mediation will be identified which shall include at least 1
lawyer and 1 representative of Post Office. The representative of Post
Office shall be:

4.15.1 Of appropriate seniority commensurate with the nature of the
Complaint and the level of settlement envisaged in the
Recommendation for Settlement.

4.15.2 From a part of the business that relates to the nature of the
complaint raised.

POL Legal (or external counsel) will liaise with CEDR (the mediation
provider) regarding the logistics of the mediation.

The mediation attendees will attempt to resolve the Complaint within the
limits of the settlement mandate, recognising the fact that it will not be
possible to settle all Complaints (due either to unreasonable expectations
on the part of the Subpostmaster or Post Office maintaining that it is not at
fault and that therefore no settlement should be offered).

5. Settlement Principles

This section sets out the Settlement Principles that will guide the scope of any
settlement offered to an Applicant.

A.

Overarching Principles

The following principles overarch the general approach to settlement:

5.1

5.2

5.3

5.4

5.5

Any settlement must take account of the risk that the settlement may set a
precedent that could (a) open the floodgates to more claims (both inside
and outside the Scheme) and/or (b) increase expectations for existing
claims.

Applicants will generally need to show that the matters that they are raising
actually led them to suffer a financial loss in their branch before a
settlement is offered.

Generally, settlements (including compensation) will only be offered for
alleged harm that arises directly out of, or was an obviously foreseeable
consequence of, a breakdown in the business relationship between the
Applicant and the Post Office.

The extent of any settlement (including the value of any compensation) will
be based on Post Office's "Risk Assessment" of the Complaint which shall
take account of:

5.4.1. The weight of the evidence adduced to demonstrate that the
Complaint and any harm suffered by an Applicant is true;

5.4.2 Post Office's culpability for the Complaint;

5.4.3 The extent to which the matters complained of caused the alleged
harm suffered by an Applicant; and

5.4.4 The extent to which the Applicant's own acts or omissions
contributed to the Complaint or harm suffered as a result.

Where Post Office does not believe that it is at fault, priority should be
given to explaining the issues to the Subpostmaster (and, if appropriate,
expressing regret for any distress suffered by the Subpostmaster) in an

effort to resolve the Complaint without the need to offer any formal
settlement.

Settlements involving convicted Applicants should only be offered where
there is clear evidence of a miscarriage of justice (see section 5B below).

Settlements will generally be driven by commercial fairness rather than
legal principles, but legal risk will still be a factor.

Settlements should to take account of the reputational implications for the
Post Office arising from any adverse publicity or political reactions but that
should not be an overriding factor. The greater the value of the settlement,
the more public interest is likely to be attracted.

Settlements that involve commercial solutions, apologies and other non-
financial compromises are to be favoured over compensation.

Although settlements are likely to be subject to confidentiality agreements,
any settlement should take into account the risk that details of that
settlement may leak into the subpostmaster community and/or the media.

Settlements should reflect the fact that for the purposes of the Scheme,
Post Office will not be relying on any legal limitation or time-bar defence
and will consider all Complaints regardless of age.

Criminal cases

Background

5.12

5.13

Offering a settlement to an Applicant who has been convicted could:
5.12.1 Be used as the basis for an appeal against that conviction; and/or
5.12.2 Cause that conviction to become unsafe.

As such, settlements involving convicted Applicants should only be offered
where there is clear evidence of a miscarriage of justice and the process
below has been followed.

Process

5.14

5.15

Where a Complaint relates to an Applicant who has been convicted, the
following additional processes should be followed:

5.14.1. The Applicant's application, case questionnaire and any
investigation findings should be forwarded to Post Office's criminal
lawyers (Cartwright King — "CK")

5.14.2 CK will review the above documents to determine whether any
disclosure is required under Post Office's prosecution duties.

5.14.3 CK will be consulted on any Recommendation for Settlement and
advise how the proposed settlement may affect the Applicant's
conviction.

Post Office has no power to overturn a conviction. If, following the
investigation phase, grounds for appeal are identified, the standard
approach will be to:

5.15.1 Suspend the standard mediation process.

5.15.2 Disclose the information giving rise to the grounds for appeal to the
Applicant (via CK).

5.15.3 Consider whether Post Office will support or oppose any appeal.

5.15.4 Consider whether Post Office might offer financial support to the
Applicant in order to conduct the appeal.
POL00199738

EA

5.15.5 Consider whether it is more appropriate to conduct the mediation
before or after any appeal is heard. In most cases, it will be more
appropriate for the appeal to be heard first.

5.15.6 Write to the Applicant explaining Post Office's stance on the above
matters and seek their views on how they wish to proceed.

5.15.7 Where a conviction is overturned on appeal, mediation may
subsequently be used to resolve the Applicant's claims / losses
that flow from that wrongful conviction.

c. Settlement thresholds

5.16 Complaints will have various degrees of credibility and will be supported by evidence of varying quality. To ensure
consistency, this section sets out guideline thresholds for when a Complaint may be considered to have sufficient

credibility/supporting evidence to merit a settlement.

5.17 The list of Complaints set out below is not exhaustive — where a Complaint is not on the list below, a case-by-case decision
will be required.

5.18 The Settlement Thresholds are for guidance only — settlements may be offered in other circumstances if good reasons exist.

EE

POL00199738

POL00199738

5.20

Defective hardware in the
branch (pin pads,
terminals, etc).

The Applicant needs to produce very clear proof that a specific branch had defective
equipment which was not fit for purpose and that the defective equipment caused a
quantifiable financial loss in the Applicant's branch accounts.

SPMRs may have issues with evidencing such complaints as POL often replaced equipment
following a complaint. However, evidence of loss must be provided before a settlement is
considered.

5.21

Horizon is too complex.

Operating processes are
unclear.

The Horizon system is being successfully used by thousands of users without complaint
about the usability of the system or that its processes are unclear / too complex.

As such, a general complaint that Horizon (or its related processes) is too difficult to operate
will therefore not be sufficient to warrant a settlement.

The Applicant needs to identify a specific problem transaction that did not have a clear or
established operating practice.

The facts of the case should be considered carefully as there may be circumstances where
Post Office has offered training but the SPMR has refused to attend or take up Post Office
on the offer of further training.

However, in circumstances where Post Office has allowed the issue to grow, by for example,
not addressing the issue in a timely manner, a settlement may be considered (but only if
there is a clear evidence of a failure/delay on Post Office's part).

5.22

Lack of support for SPMR.

Helplines were unhelpful.

The Applicant needs show that they sought support from Post Office and that the support
provided did not solve the issue.

The facts of the case should be considered carefully as there may be circumstances where
Post Office has offered training but the SPMR has refused to attend or take Post Office up
on the offer of further training.

If, given the particular circumstances, there is evidence that Post Office has not properly
supported a SPMR in that Post Office:

(a) _ failed to follow its established practices in effect at the time of the events
complained about; or

(b) there was a manifest error in those practices that should have been remedied at
the time of the events complained about;

a settlement may be considered.

5.23

Poor/inadequate training
on Horizon system.

The Horizon system is being successfully used by thousands of users without complaint
about Post Office's training.

As such, general complaints about POL’s standard training are not sufficient.

The Applicant needs to identify specific circumstances that made his/her training
inadequate.

18
POL00199738

POL00199738

Confidential and legally privileged

POL should consider the
following:

e Is there an issue with guidance/training? i.e. does the Applicant's complaint relate to
an issue where there is little guidance/training?

e ls there any pattern in the Applicant's behaviour?

e Has the Applicant failed to take POL up on the offer of training?

5.24

SPMR unable to
investigate losses.

SPMR did not have
access to adequate
transaction records.

General complaints about a lack of visibility of historic transactions are not sufficient.

The Applicant needs to show a problem with the audit trail of a specific product/transaction
and that a quantifiable financial loss in the Applicant's branch accounts has been suffered
as a result.

The Applicant also needs to show reasonable attempts to investigate losses.

It should be considered whether it would have made a difference had a full audit trail been
available. In some cases even if the audit trail had been available it would not have resolved
the overall complaint.

5.25

POL unfairly pursued
losses/prosecution with a
bias against SPMR.

The Applicant must show that Post office systemically failed to look into specific issues (not
general complaints) raised by the Applicant or systemically failed to follow its processes that
were in effect at the time of the events complained of.

Any remedy in response to a
claim that a criminal investigation/prosecution is unsound must be approved by POL’s
criminal legal team (see section B above).

5.26

SPMR was "forced" to file
false accounts

POL does not accept that an Applicant can ever be forced to render false accounts.

No settlement will be offered where problems / losses were a result of (a) an Applicant filing
false accounts or (b) an Applicant's own deliberately wrong actions or decisions.

fair and legally enforceable. The table below summarises the types of settlement that may, in Post Office's discretion, be
offered. The selection of an appropriate Settlement Option (or Options) will be assessed on the particular circumstances of

E. Compensation matrix

5.28 If a Complaint meets a Settlement Threshold (see section C) and Post Office considers that compensation may be appropriate
(see section D), the level of compensation that may be offered to an Applicant will be guided by:

5.28.1 Post Office's Risk Assessment of the Complaint (see section A); and

5.28.2 The matrix below.

5.32

Loss of retail business

Depends on value of individual business

Difficult for SPMR to claim because POL could
always terminate on 3 months’ notice and so
loss of branch and subsequent loss of wider

Commercially, Post Office does not accept
responsibility for performance of retail business.

Compensation for loss of retail business
will not be paid.

5.33

Distress / loss reputation

Difficult to value in cash terms.

These types of loss are generally irrecoverable

POL00199738
POL00199738

Confidential and legally privileged

5.36 Goodwill payments may be considered where an Applicant suffers harm
that cannot be quantified in pecuniary terms (eg. injury to feelings, distress,
social discredit, reputation damage, etc.). A goodwill payment may, in Post

Office's discretion, be offered if:

5.36.1 A settlement threshold has been met under section C; and

5.36.2 The Applicant has not deliberately caused the non-pecuniary harm
(eg. where the applicant has invited adverse media attention); and

5.36.3 The harm suffered is sufficiently serious to warrant a goodwill
payment in accordance with the thresholds below:

Type of harm

Threshold

Distress / injured feelings

The distress must be more than normal
commercial pressure that would be
experienced through loss of contract /
business.

Damage to reputation / social
discredit

The damage to reputation requires
evidence that the relevant events were
publicly known and led to public
criticism (eg. adverse press coverage).

5.37 If the above thresholds are met, the level of goodwill payment will be
dependent on the level of harm and Post Office's culpability for that harm
in accordance with the guidelines below. It is anticipated that where a
goodwill payment is appropriate, most cases will fall in the bottom band.

6. Direct Engagement with Subpostmasters

Overview

61

6.2

It is anticipated that in a number of cases, it will be possible and
appropriate to resolve an Applicant's Complaint without the need for
mediation.

This would have the benefits of:

6.2.1 Delivering an earlier resolution for both Post Office and the
Applicant.

6.2.2 Reducing the time and resources spent on a Complaint.

Process

6.3

6.4

6.5

Post Office shall attempt to directly engage with every Applicant. Mediation
should only be used where settlement through direct discussions is
inappropriate or has been exhausted.

In particular, POL legal (through Bond Dickinson) shall look to identify the
possibility for directly engaging with a Subpostmaster:

6.4.1 On receipt of a Subpostmaster's Case Questionnaire Response.

6.4.2 After completion of Post Office's own investigation into a
Complaint.

6.4.3 When providing advice on settling a Complaint prior to mediation.

If a Complaint is identified as one that could be progressed through direct
engagement with the Applicant:

6.5.1. The Complaint will be notified to Belinda! Crowe to confirm that the
case is potentially suitable for early resolution.

6.5.2 A Settlement Recommendation and a Settlement Mandate will be
produced and approved in accordance with paragraphs 4.8 to 4.14.

6.5.3 Belinda Crowe will nominate a suitable person to engage with the

Applicant with a view to reaching a resolution within the Scope of
the Settlement Mandate.

6.6 Post Office shall maintain an open mind as to which Complaints may be
resolved through direct discussions with Applicants. The following factors
may however indicate that a Complaint is suitable:

6.6.1

6.6.2

6.6.3

6.6.4

6.6.5

6.6.6

6.6.7

6.6.8

The matter could be settled through providing (a) an apology
and/or (b) an explanation of the events in dispute to the Applicant.

The cost of any settlement is less than £15,000".

The case is likely to attract negative media attention that could
possibly be avoided if settled early.

Post Office has clearly made an error that will warrant a settlement.

The Applicant is clearly at fault and Post Office is highly likely not
to offer any settlement.

The Applicant is still in post and the Complaint could therefore be
resolved through additional support.

The Complaint is one that cannot be investigated due to its age
and therefore mediation would be unproductive.

The Complaint is of a sensitive nature (eg. the Applicant or their
family is under significant stress) and would be more appropriately
resolved without mediation

6.7.1

6.7.2

6.7.3

Where failure to reach a settlement could undermine the credibility
of the Scheme.

Where there is a significant disagreement between Post Office and
the Applicant

Where there is a significant difference in the amount claimed by
the Applicant and the amount that could be paid in compensation

and therefore should proceed through a full mediation process to
ensure the best deal possible.
