It's unlikely that Deloitte will finish their work on the suspense accounts before the Defence deadline. I have however
discussed the suspense account issue with them and the attached is, I believe, a fair reflection of how Post Office's
accounting operates. I also very briefly spoke to the FD and he agreed with this.

You're going to hate it.

One point to note — we should try to avoid talking about suspense accounts as if they are known entity. This is a very
loose phrase that could be interpreted to cover a larger or smaller number of accounts depending on how it is
interpreted.

Can we discuss tomorrow please?
