Branches will be forced to declare stock when they don"t want to. Apparent reappearance of withdrawn
stock may cause spurious discrepancies. Avoidance action taken so far is only appropriate in the short-term
while very few branches are affected; over the next few months it could be affecting around 10 branches per
week. NBSC aware of problem.

boffice rolled from TP10 BP4 to TP10 BP5 on 09/02/2011 and will do the Trading Period balance on 16/02/2011.

fhe office reports the balance done on 09/02/2011 was fine. Then at the end of the day on 10/02/2011 the office did the daily
claration and declared their stamps and went into discrepancies. The system brought up 6 pages of losses and ga hat
jcontained items that are no longer valid stock, such as old first day envelopes and 58 PO saving stamps. The office then called

the helpline and was passed between both NBSC and HSD trying to determine the cause. On the morning of 11/02/2011 the spmr went

FUJ00086720
FUJ00086720
finto declare stock to check and there was an existing declaration there dated 17/02/2010. The office went into the declaration

land confirmed it showed the PO saving stamps and other stock items, some showing as minus stock amounts, that were not correct to
the branch.

Itt somehow seems that the system has somehow picked up this declaration and this is the cause of the discrepancies appearing on
the system. The spmr was told to declare the correct stock figures but is reluctant to do this as this will cause discrepancies
hen she next balances that are not relevant to herself at the moment. The only call reference supplied to the spmr from HSD is
3626603.

can this be investigated to see how it has happened and want can be done to allow the office to balance next week without showing
discrepancies in the balance. I am aware of issues with PO saving stamps reappearing on the system as have a call under
investigation for South Cerney SPSO, FAD 398523, but have not come across a declaration reappearing from nearly 12 months ago.

ltooks as if the branch had a stock declaration from TP 10 BP 5 a year ago, when they first migrated.

It have spoken to Paul Mann at NBSC and sent him details of how to get rid of the old declaration (I hope he will share this with
INBSC). He will sort out this branch.

le need to find out whether other branches are going to be affected in the same way. There is already a known problem with
declarations containing withdrawn products, and possibly this problem could result in more of these.

IDate:44-Feb-2011 14:42:38 User:Anne Chambers

[Start of Response]

the old declaration has been removed from branch 169217 so they should be able to balance correctly without being forced to
}leclare stock again. NBSC have also been asked to remove a similar old declaration at branch 113818.

the attached spreadsheet shows 137 declarations, of various types, which have not been used since last July. These may be used
lgain unexpectedly once the same TP/BP is reached. The Stock declarations are most likely to cause problems as users will then be
forced to make stock declarations when they probably don't want to (and possibly the declarations include stock of withdrawn
products) .

lArchiving strategy for table BRDB_BRANCH DECL appears to be that declarations are kept indefinitely unless they are zero
leclarations or belong to a stock unit deleted more than 28 days ago.

IBRDB and BRSS have the same entries so we shouldn't need to worry about any Streams problems when removing old entries.

Passing call to development/design to find out how these old entries should be removed - this needs to be done ASAP — and how to
tidy up consistently in future.

[this needs to be addressed at 2 levels:

the fix is a change to the BRDB archiving such that any row in BRDB_BRANCH DECL is archived (along with related rows in
JBRDB_BRANCH_DECL ITEM) 6 months (ie 180 days) after the timestamp in update timestamp. This will result in any Declaration being
discarded after € months and so avoid the wrap around issue. Note that discarding an Declaration purely means that a complete
eclaration will be required rather than being able update an old one and so has no impact on the accounts.

However looking at the spreadsheet attached to the peak there are 4 branches that will have an issue in the next month, so we
must either contact the branches and get them to carry out a zero declaration (which I understand Anne has done in the one branch
ith a problem today), or we should raise an MSC to tidy up the data. I propose that an MSC is raised so as to remove any
Declarations that have an update timestamp of July 2010 or older, which then allows time for the fix to be progressed in normal
timescales.

Passing Peak to BRDB Dev to progress.

[DEPENDENCTE:
re there any other PEAKs or CPs with interdependencies on the proposed fix?
b> No

are there any clone peaks to take the delivery to a different deployment group? If yes is there any order in which they must be
kieployed?
b> No

lany other dependencies such as Infrastructure changes or technical/configuration changes that will not included in the
pevelopment fix?
b> No

[DEPLOYMENT DETATL:
lboes the fix include procedures that are known not to be packagable by Integration in an automatically deployable baseline
(DPVB)? If so, please comment on the nature and technical complexity of such procedures

b> No

joes the fix require a reboot?

lboes the fix apply to a tered databas

b> Yes.

FUJ00086720
FUJ00086720

Inf so must the deployment be done to all at the same time?
b> No. BRDB Node 1 only.

DEV EFFORT IN MANDAYS:
b> Total dev effort - 1 man day.

If the Man Days figures will be different to the elapsed duration, please state so here. Also, if there are any constraints on
jwork beginning, please state here.

b> None

HMPACT ON USER:
Benefit of making the fix.

b> Older branch declarations for a recurring TP/BP wont be picked up in Branch Declarations report and the fix would prevent
Iaiscrepancies in stock declarations.

lwhat does the user have to do to get this problem?
b> Roll a branch forward into a TP/BP for which there are old unused branch declaractions from previous year. Once rolled
forward, the user should try and generate the declarations report.

low does it affect them when it occurs?
b> False discrepancies will be reported in the declarations report. Declarations will not balance without the branch manager re-
leclaring the stock.

iow many branches in the estate are likely to be affected by this issue
jbo not state any of the technical solution detail here.

b> In the next few months the forecast is about 10 branches per week as branches will always roll forward to next TP/BP.

IMPACT ON OPERATIONS:
il] the absense of a fix for this issue impact the ability of the operations team to support the HNGX system?

b> No

If so, please comment on the severity of the impact and specify if any workaround for the issue exists.

lsenefit of fix that may not visible to end user.

b> Unused declarations older than 180 days will get archived and purged from Branch database thereby saving database space to
jwhatever extent that might be.

]ZAVE RELEVANT KELS BEEN CREATED OR UPDATED?
state Yes, or if not, why not.
p> Yes. KEL achal357Q authorized.

IMPACT ON TEST:
what independent test coverage/scenarios does development recommend?
[this will often be about the level of regression testing required.

b> Identify a test branch that may have declarations of various stock types that are older than 180 days from current business
jaate. When the archive / purge process in BRDB [BRDBCO04] is run it should get rid of all such older declarations both from BRDB
land BRSS (if streams is configured in the test rig).

hat CIT test coverage does development recommend?
b> Same as above

hat Development test scenarios are needed?
>> Same as above

hat Development test scenarios manual/automated should be promoted to CIT?
b> None

RISKS (of releasing and of not releasing proposed fix):
lwhat live problems will there be if we do not issue this fix?

b> In the next few months more and more branches will rollover into a TP/BP combination for which there might be older branch
declarations. Such branches will face stock declarations discrepancy and won't be able to balance stock accounts unless they do a
jre-declare of stocks (which the end user is reluctant to do).

hat are the risks of this fix having unexpected interactions with other areas?
b> None

iis this a high-risk area in which changes have caused problems in the past?
b> No

should we consider a pilot rollout and of what sort?

b> No

IuIST OF LIKELY DELIVERABLES:
