WG discussions

1. Sending applicants the Post Office investigation report

The Working Group discussed whether to provide the applicant with the PO investigation report at
the time it is passed to SS (a suggestion raised at the previous face to face meeting which PO had
agreed to consider). This would allow the applicants/ advisors more time to consider it and be
better placed to comment on SS’s draft CRR within the 7 day deadline. The Working Group agreed
that the PO investigation report should be issued to applicants subject to rigorous safeguards aimed
at preventing both disclosure of the information contained in the report and applicants/advisors
seeking to influence SS’s draft CRR by engaging in discussions with SS prior to its completion. To
this end the Working Group agreed that the PO investigation reports should be issued to the
applicant/advisor with a covering letter from the Chair which makes the following points:

» The content of the PO reports are confidential

>» No attempt should be made to contact SS about the investigation report before they
release their draft CRR, and any such contact will be will be ignored.

» Due to the early release of the Post Office investigation report, the current 7 day limit for
responses to draft CRRs will be rigorously enforced.

>» There will be no entitlement to fees or disbursements for work conducted by advisors on
behalf of their applicants between the release of the Post Office investigation report and
the release of the draft CRR.

>» SS’s expected delivery date for the draft CRR will be referenced.

ACTION: All Post Office investigation reports — and associated evidence — currently on
Huddle to be sent to applicant — with covering letter from the Chair. DO to draft a letter for
SAH and the WG to consider.

2. Chair’s mediation test

The Working Group again discussed whether to change the Chair's mediation test from one which
determines if there is a reasonable prospect of resolution to one to one that determines whether
mediation is an appropriate way of offering the applicant their “day in Court”. In discussion the
following issues were considered:

« Whether mediation was the only method by which applicants would be able to resolve their
dispute in line with the Scheme’s original purpose

e Whether there was an expectation from applicants that their cases would be mediated so
that they could have their “day in Court’.

e Whether the current test remained the most appropriate.

« Whether mediation was a sensible course of action if there was not a reasonable likelihood
of resolving differences.

* Whether it had ever been the intention of the Scheme to mediate all cases.

As the Working Group did not reach an agreed position the Chair asked JFSA to put forward a
submission by COP Tuesday 22 July setting out why they believed the Chair's test should change.
The PO would then have two days to respond to this submission (by COP Thursday 24 July. JFSA
would have an opportunity to make a further submission in response to the PO's submission by
COP on 25 July. The Chair would then consider the submissions and come to a decision.

ACTION: Both parties to make submissions in accordance with the deadlines agreed by the
WG.

3. Notifying M054

The Working Group agreed to defer a decision on notifying M054 until a decision has been made on
the Chair's mediation test.

4. M076

e¢ Working Group decision on length of mediation — Working Group agreed that all mediations are

consideration.
