Focus for Next Week

On track to deliver the baselined plan but some challenges exist resulting in Amber status. We are currently re-planning to address
these challenges. SISD Outline Solution evaluations and moderations completed as planned on 14/12. Supplier notification letters will be sent on
21/12 subject to Exec approval (Lesley Sewell, Sue Barker and Nick Kennett). Integrated Programme plan on track to be updated by 28/12. CRs
drafted for changes to Towers plan, transfer of the Incumbent IT Supplier Management project to BAU procurement, removal of TSS from
Incumbent IT Supplier Management scope and CSC options assessment. A review session to be held on 19/12 to finalise impact assessment of
these CRs. Networks Procurement Options Analysis is in progress and completion date is to be confirmed w/c 17/12.

Anticipated Final Costs (AFC) to exceed Requested Business Plan Budget by c £400k. The AFC is £14.6m vs £14.2m as requested via
Business Plan and £1.2m higher than the original PID of £13.4m. The Project Leads are in the process of raising CRs in line with the integrated
programme plan which may impact the forecast. First cut of revised Benefits figures is expected in late January as per update provided in the
appendix. Transformation budget for business planning as well as impacts from Transition, Separation, TUPE and Dual Running have been
discussed with CPMO, SPMO and Central Finance. Finance team assistance is being sought to assist with Benefits Refresh. Meetings held this
week to kick off next steps in Budget and Affordability for Bidders. This will reset the baselines for the Benefits case in late January.

Comments

Project complete and we continue to track benefits. Frameworks live and available for use and benefits of speed to market and access to best
of breed suppliers being realised. Increasing number of projects are now using or plan to use frameworks (e.g. Counters project will be using IT
Products framework in January).

On track for service commencement dates but some challenges exist that need to be addressed to remain on course for contract award.
SISD - Evaluation and moderation of 5 Outline Solutions completed on 14/12. Supplier notification letters will be sent on 21/12 following Exec
approval. Exec approval obtained for Dialogue 2 and ISFT (Invitation to Submit Final Tender) deliverable plans. Update on top dependencies for
ISFT is provided in the appendix. Towers — Detailed re-planning for Al, DC and EUC towers to complete by 28/12. A CR regarding re-planning has
been drafted and is being impact assessed. Networks Procurement Options analysis is in progress.

On track, with some challenges. Status is amber as the plan is being revised beyond Feb 2013 and there is no approved budget for additional PM
resources. Completed participation in SISD Outline Solution evaluation. Workshop on PMO Org Structure design complete. Continued with planning
to feed into integrated programme plan. Dependencies on Op Model for Org Structure and Governance defined.

Delayed due to pending revision of plan. This project will now be managed by Fay Chandler in BAU Procurement. Re-planning currently in
progress with BAU Procurement and to be completed by 31/01/13. Commenced Analysis of BT (Cortez) contract. Continued TSS negotiations with
Fujitsu. CR drafted for removal of TSS from scope and transfer into BAU procurement and is currently under review.

On track with some potential delays due to delays in Towers procurement. Transition Procurement Support — Completed EUC workshops
as input for EUC Service Take On paper. Completed first draft of the SISD ISFT schedule. Delivery of Al ISOS Service Take On paper draft has
changed due to delay in procurement date of Al ISOS issue. IT Separation — Released 6 solution documents for review. All documents to be issued
for review by first week of Jan. Impact assessed CR for changes to dates in Towers procurement.

+ Towers procurement may be delayed
due to lessons learnt from SISD
dialogue, resource constraints and
factoring in QA and governance reviews
into the plan. Re-planning is underway.
ACR will be presented to the
Programme Board on 14/01 to review
the changes and their impacts as a
result of re-planning.

* These milestones have been delayed due to:
*QA and governance process delays;
*Lessons learnt from first phase of SI dialogue and DC ISOS preparations; and
*Resource constraints (availability of BAU resources).

We are currently re-planning due to the reasons above with a view to reduce impact on programme timescales. This is due to complete
by 28/12. A CR will be presented to the Programme Board on 14/01 to review these changes.

Notes:

Rebased Anticipated Final Costs of the Project since initial review. Actuals until P7 included and initial
forecasts relating to scope changes that have occurred.

During December additional work will be undertaken to refine the numbers.

Figures above are based on business decisions and the forecast is subject to change.

Budget transfer of £913k from 12/13 to 13/14 requested regarding Alignment and Training.

Budget includes original base case of £13.4m + £0.8m requested for 13/14 = £14.2m

New Business Case and Change requests anticipated early 2013.

Updates as of 13/12:

+ Anticipated Final Costs (AFC) has been updated to
reflect existing assumptions and known requirements to
produce this reforecast of the programme, as well as a
prudent view on the impact of separation.

+ Figures presented do not include Transition costs. This
will be covered in a separate business case due to be
submitted in Jan 2013.

The total AFC is £14.6m or £1.2m higher than the
approved baseline of £13.4m:

+ This is £800k for 13/14 additional costs as below.

+ £354k 12-13 — this is a forecast overspend, however we
do expect to bring this back closer in line with Budget.

+ £69k in 11-12 overspend

2013/14 Business Plan includes all known cost
increases and a request for an additional £800k:

+ Scope changes with Towers as requirement became
more defined. £250k.

+ BAU Resource constraints on POL knowledge so
procurement now Staggered, leading to additional costs.
£250k.

+ Impact from BAU/Skillsgroup charging structure vs
original base case £300k.

+ Plan being worked up with finance to support the
Benefits case rework during December and January.

+ Continued meetings with POL finance/SPMO to ensure
alignment of all reported numbers and transparency.

+ Benefits Tracking is being discussed with SPMO and
POL Finance to align requirements and outputs and to
understand the limitations in data and assumptions.

+ Costs for G-219 IT&C Transformation Programme has a
tisk of overspend due to scope changes. We are working
within the programme to manage costs.

Please note:

+ The figures presented for IT&C Transformation do not
include the costs associated with Horizon Evolution,
Separation and Transition planning as they will become
separate business cases.

+ Figures inclusive of irrecoverable VAT.

+ These figures are updated on a fortnightly basis.
