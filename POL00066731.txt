Moderator: Okay, that 7:38, on the 24th, transaction at 7:40, so two minutes later on the 24th, you
sell 120000 euros, at one point six seven two five, and it comes to a sterling value of 71748 pounds
and eighty eighty pence.

(TC: 00:02:53)
Carl Adrian Page: So you're saying that must be for the Post Office-,

(TC: 00:02:53)
Moderator: Indeed.

(TC: 00:02:56)
Carl Adrian Page: Okay.

(TC: 00:02:55)

(TC: 00:02:58)

(TC: 00:03:00)

Moderator: But how does that reflect on what you’ve, you’ve effectively just shipped them
straight out to them, haven't you? (talking over each other 03.21) -,

(TC: 00:03:22)

Carl Adrian Page: If you're going from that rate, then that won't have been the same transaction, as
(inaudible 03.25) I might have had 120,000 already in, cause you can see from my records I’ve always
kept a lot of euros in stock, yeah? Okay. And, so the previous 120,000.

(TC: 00:03:40)
Moderator: But that shouldn't come into the equation, should it Carl? Why should that-,

(TC: 00:03:40)
Carl Adrian Page: I'm still trying to, still trying to make the Post Office, if you buy one point six eight,
I'd say one point six-,

(TC: 00:03:48)
Moderator: So, presumably, that 120000 euros, which you booked in at 7:38, were for Mr
Whitehouse?

(TC: 00:03:53)
Carl Adrian Page: It may have been, may have not been.

(TC: 00:03:57)
Moderator: Well, who else was it for then?

(TC: 00:03:58)
Carl Adrian Page: Well I might have had 120000 previously in stock, for Mr Whitehouse to come and
pick up.

(TC: 00:04:02)
Moderator: Yeah. But, yeah, so?

(TC: 00:04:07)
Carl Adrian Page: Well I might have put them in a better rate, one point six eight or something.

Carl Adrian Page: You’ve asked me that question before and I just, I put, I put on my own there to
decide the rate, ' cause, I mean, wrongly or rightly, all I' ve ever tried to do, is not make anything for
myself, is to make money for the Post Office.

Carl Adrian Page: Yes, it does.

postmaster do that?

(TC: 00:05:06)

get to it. I'm staggered by how much you made us on the 13th.

(TC: 00:05:36)
Patrick Farrington: Well if there is a question you want to put, will you go onto that transaction please?

(TC: 00:05:40)

Moderator: Let's look at Friday the 20th of December. Friday the 20th of December, eighth of,
sorry 8:46, 20th of December, at the bottom there, you transfer in 150000 euros at one point six
five, giving 90909 pound and nine pence, okay?

(TC: 00:06:07)
Carl Adrian Page: Yeah.

(TC: 00:06:07)
Moderator: 8:48, two minutes later, hmm, sorry, yeah, that’s the top part there you can see, is an
exact copy of that.

(TC: 00:06:21)
Carl Adrian Page: Mmhmm.

(TC: 00:06:21)

Moderator: Yeah, okay? So, immediately after transferring them in, two minutes later, you do a
transaction for 144,000 euros at one point six five, and err, err, Whitehouse pays you, sorry, what's
that, 87272 and 73 pence, yeah? Exactly the same rates as you transferred in and sold to. So,
without me having to tell you, right, that you made nothing, yeah, because if we work out what
144000 (inaudible 06.51) been transferred in at that amount, it comes to exactly what you sold it at.
So you made nil, on there. You gave him the euros away, basically, why?

Carl Adrian Page: Yeah but you, you. Yes I am trying to make you a profit.

(TC: 00:07:51)
Carl Adrian Page: But you' re telling me the post office only buy them in at one point six five?

(TC: 00:07:51)
Moderator: They, that’s what Hem will book them out to you-,

(TC: 00:07:51)
Carl Adrian Page: You, I asked you the question earlier, you said that's what the Post Office buy them in
at, at one point six five.

(TC: 00:07:51)

Moderator: Yes they do, that’s first rate. And Hem will book them out to you, using the rates,
which are published. But Hem will have to comply with the published rates as well, they get one of
those faxes daily as well.

(TC: 00:08:09)
Carl Adrian Page: So why has nobody has, why's nobody questioned it?

(TC: 00:08:16)
Moderator: Well because nobody knows that you're selling them for nothing.

(TC: 00:08:20)

transactions I’ve done.

(TC: 00:08:26)
Carl Adrian Page: And I thought, better get the differential balance right at the end of the week, that’s
the profit the Post Office made, apart from what we buying and selling out there as well.

(TC: 00:08:35)

Moderator: No, it doesn't work that way. So your evaluation figures, which is what you're

referring to, isn't it? Your evaluation figures should have been, should have been very high,
compared to what they were. And granted, maybe those should have been picked up by the

business earlier, but they weren't.

(TC: 00:08:50)
Carl Adrian Page: Well that’s not down to me, is it, I mean if, well, if I asked the question if somebody
picked them up earlier, and then I'd been told about it, then none of this would happened would it?

(TC: 00:09:04)
Moderator: But you see, the thing is, sorry-,

(TC: 00:09:07)
Patrick Farrington: I was going to suggest that we ask Mr Page this question, had he discussed this with
anybody, before, and if so, who and what had been said about it?

(TC: 00:09:21)
Carl Adrian Page: Well (inaudible 09.21) isn't it?

(TC: 00:09:21)

Moderator: I know but, you’ve seen the statement from Steve Garrity, haven't you? Cause that’s
a bundle which was, was sent to you, and he doesn't recall any conversations, and can't remember,
he says.

(TC: 00:09:49)
Colin Price: He would know that as the retail network manager, though.

(TC: 00:09:51)
Carl Adrian Page: I can't answer for retail line network manager, I’ve come to the Post Office outside
five years ago, I’ve never been in the Post Office before. (TC 00:10:00)

Moderator: Okay. Let's have a quick look and this will be the last one, as I’ve mentioned the
13th-,

(TC: 00:10:06)

Patrick Farrington: What's the purpose of keep putting these transactions to him? You' re not actually
asking any questions, other than the same thing, and with respect, you' re not actually achieving anything
different.

(TC: 00:10:18)

Moderator: Okay, well to be fair to your client, I think he has a right, if he wants to, to see any
evidence that we have, which may form any part of the case that results in a prosecution. I would
loathe to get to a court case and be told, well you didn't show him the evidence.

(TC: 00:10:40)

with transfers going in from the eight of January, all the way through to the day of the 13th. Yeah
okay? Eighth of January, 10:25, 150000 euros transferred in at one point six two seven seven,
sterling value is 92154.57. And there's no transactions between the eight and the 13th.

Carl Adrian Page: Okay.

(TC: 00:11:46)

Moderator: The reason I have to say it in full Carl is because obviously it's recording on the tape,
I'm not trying to bore you. Um, and then on the 11th of January, at 11:39, again, another 150000 at
one point six one eight, 92707.05.

(TC: 00:12:05)
Carl Adrian Page: Okay.

(TC: 00:12:07)
Moderator: And then we come onto the transaction itself, right. But just before we discuss that, so
that's 600000, 600000 euros you’ve transferred in, on those four days, okay?

Moderator: The very first one on the eighth, if we say, 134000 was transferred in at one point six

(TC: 00:13:26)
Carl Adrian Page: Yep.

(TC: 00:13:29)

Moderator: And you sold them for that value we already talked about, which gives us a difference
of 794 pounds and 97 pence. Now that’s over half a million euros, Carl, for which you supposedly
made us, which isn't as I said, supposedly made us, nearly 800 pounds. Now, had you sold 11800
euros, at the normal rate, you would have made us 800 pounds.

(TC: 00:14:00)
Carl Adrian Page: Okay.

(TC: 00:14:00)
Moderator: Do you think it's right, business commercially right, for someone to say, by selling half
a million euros, I made you the same profit as selling 12000 euros?

(TC: 00:14:13)
Carl Adrian Page: But as I said before, the amount of transactions that were coming through, I thought I
was making the Post Office some money.

(TC: 00:14:20)

Moderator: I'm not a businessman, but even I can see that that doesn't equate. Having to sell
eleven, sorry, half a million euros, to make 800 pounds, when I could have sold 1200 euros to make
the same value.

(TC: 00:14:43)
Carl Adrian Page: Yeah but I could still sell 1200 and make that amount. But if the gentleman hadn't
come in though the door then I wouldn’t have made anything at all, would I?

(TC: 00:14:48)
Moderator: No, but then, you know, was it not feasible to sell 12000 euros-,

(TC: 00:14:56)
Carl Adrian Page: But I do, do, I do do that to the general public anyway, don’t I?

(TC: 00:14:58)

Moderator: Well that’s what I mean, so if you're making that profit anyway, do you need Mr
Whitehouse, and do you need to be giving him preferential rates because (talking over each other

(TC: 00:15:05)

Carl Adrian Page: To keep him custom, I thought I was making the Post Office some money, because a
large amount of transactions. You know yourself, you come off the street and buy ten Volvos, you get a
better deal than buying one Volvo every three years, if you' re going to buy ten Volvos a month

Moderator: Um, okay. Right, we briefly touched on this I think, at the last interview, so I won't
flog it to death, but I need to ask you again. I think in the last interview, we talked very briefly
about buybacks, euros being bought back?

(TC: 00:16:08)
Carl Adrian Page: Yeah.

(TC: 00:16:09)
Moderator: At the Post Office. um, you remind me, is there a large need for buybacks at the
office?

(TC: 00:16:16)
Carl Adrian Page: No.

(TC: 00:16:15)
Moderator: There isn't?

(TC: 00:16:15)
Carl Adrian Page: No. So what are you gonna ask me why I don’t give preferential rates for buyback?

(TC: 00:16:21)

Moderator: No, I wasn't going to ask you that, I asked you that last time. But, no I wasn't going to
ask you that. um, what would you say, you know, roughly, is the buyback on a weekly basis? Off
euros?

(TC: 00:16:32)
Carl Adrian Page: I couldn’t tell you.

come back to that outlet. Is that the case? That's what-, that's what you were quoting me in the last

(TC: 00:20:15)

Moderator: Right, okay. Let me um, let me quickly show you this, um, schedule. This is an old
schedule which is (inaudible 20.24) my exhibit. This is a schedule, which, and again, as I say, I’ve
been through all though the till rolls that we have, concentrate mainly on the 2000 period right.
This one starts the 28th of March, 2002. Okay, and concludes, on the fourth of January 03, okay,
and what it shows, is, it shows the date, taken off the till roll, cash account week, the time of the
transaction, and the buyers note, what it was, it's euros or in this case, the amount bought back, the
rate applied, the sterling value and any comments that may help me. And attached to the back of
that is the copies of all of them. Okay right?

(TC: 00:21:01)
Carl Adrian Page: Yeah, yeah.

(TC: 00:21:06)

Moderator: Now, what I want to have a quick chat about, you know, just talk about one or two of
them, is well, let's talk about the totals in amounts, right. The total there is 98030 bought back, and
sterling value 58507 pounds 64. Would you say that’s probably high or low, or what, in a ten
month period.

(TC: 00:21:30)

Carl Adrian Page: I don’t know, I mean we do, as you say, I mean I can’t compare to what we do, we do
seven and a half thousand transactions, (inaudible 21.37) what does somebody usually do with seven and
a half thousand transactions?

(TC: 00:21:40)
Moderator: Okay.

(TC: 00:21:41)
Carl Adrian Page: I mean, usually, demographically people have got a lot of cash, and they go ona
holidays and take cash with them, not more-, not traveller’ s cheques but they buy a lot of cash

(TC: 00:21:48)

Moderator: Right, okay. Let's have a look at some of the figures then. On the 28th of March, 2,000
euros were bought back, 24th of March, there's two amounts, um, both at the same time, one after
the other, 4,680-,

really less than, err, a 1000, the odd occasion where they've happened immediately after or at the
same time.

(TC: 00:22:15)
Carl Adrian Page: So you're telling me no-one's come back and they' ve had, they've come in for 30

(TC: 00:22:22)

Moderator: (talking over each other 22.22) No I'm sure they have, I'm sure they have, I haven't
picked out every single buyback, I’ve picked out everything which is at the thousand and above,
and as I say, the occasional ones where it's 630 or less, when they've happened at the same time-,

(TC: 00:22:33)
Carl Adrian Page: So, you're just showing me the large amounts?

another few, on the 24th of April, at 10:46 somebody buys back 4680 euros in two transactions. The
previous day, on the 23rd, and the day after on the 25th, um, you sold, euros to Mr Whitehouse.

(TC: 00:27:10)
Carl Adrian Page: Okay, so if you wanna go down that route, go down that route but I suggest you check
the Co-op first.

(TC: 00:27:13)

Moderator: Okay. Because, see, also, I went back to see, um, Jane Beighty and, and Margaret
Pierce and they said no, they’ll be further statements, and in their statements, as well as touching
on one or two other little things about balancing, they touch on buybacks, and er-,

(TC: 00:27:32)
Carl Adrian Page: Did they say we used to go to the Co-op?

(TC: 00:27:31)

Moderator: No, I'm talking about buybacks from customers at (inaudible 27.35) Post Office, and I
asked them what generally it is, and I'll read out the last bit of Shirley's Jane Beighty's statement, it
says, whilst operating the Bureau till, when Carl was managing the Post Office, I had performed
numerous transactions where I bought back euros from customers, and the amounts involved are
generally very small, between 10 and 200 euros. I cannot ever recall having bought back more than
a thousand euros from a customer. Now, (talking over each other 28.02) Margaret, pretty much
says the same thing in her statement, um, I have a limited amount to do with the bureau de change

transactions at the office and although I do recall serving customers where we have bought back
euros from them. These as far as I can recall have been for small amounts, such as 50 to 100 euros.
I personally have not performed the transaction buying back for a thousand or more euros.

(TC: 00:28:27)
Carl Adrian Page: Okay. Well I’ve just said that to you now anyway, haven't I?

(TC: 00:28:28)
Moderator: Right so, all of these large buybacks must have been down to you, then, you must have
performed them.

Carl Adrian Page: Majority of them, I would have thought, yes. Seeing as I was doing the majority of all
the transactions, yes.

Basically, the one from Customs and Excise, um, they start on the 16th of January 02, and they go
all the way through to, um, the 4th of January 03. This relates to more specifically to Mr
Whitehouse, because these are, theses are transactions, times and amounts where Mr Whitehouse
has gone off to Thomas Cook, and sold the euros that he's bought from you, back to Thomas Cook.
Yeah? And made his little profit. Yeah? Okay. Now, what I’ve done, using that information and
that schedule prepared by customs, and my own little schedule there, right, and the copies of
cheques I’ve got there back from Chesterfield, I’ve prepared this little schedule here, alright. The
first portion, deals with the purchase, that’s this one basically, all the purchases made from
Rugeley Post Office. The middle section, deals with the cheques, that I’ve been able to find, for
those purchases, the amounts involved and the BC of E date, the date that they came to light, okay?
Then the final section deals with the Thomas Cook deposits, the dates Mr Whitehouse went in, the
amount he deposited, any difference and any comments for my (inaudible 31.22), okay?

(TC: 00:31:22)
Carl Adrian Page: Yeah, yeah.

(TC: 00:31:22)

Moderator: I don’t want to labour this one too much regarding, um, the differences, um, but, I do
want to use it to demonstrate some of the delays in cheques, but basically, you can see the red
figures here, for instance on the 14th of March 02, which was a Thursday, he buys 64900 euros-,

(TC: 00:31:45)
Carl Adrian Page: Mm-hmm.

(TC: 00:31:45)
Moderator: Right, um, and um, if we go across, on the same day, right, later on, he deposits 60000
euros, and thereby it was 4900 pounds less that he bought from you, okay?

(TC: 00:32:01)
Carl Adrian Page: Yeah.

(TC: 00:32:00)
Moderator: That, that’s what I do down here, on some of them you can see blue figures with a plus
value, and that means he's deposited more than he's bought from you, alright?

Carl Adrian Page: Okay.

okay, now, I want to talk specifically about one of two of those sort of transactions, not, I'm not
gonna, um, go through all of them. But as I say, it was specifically to do with um, uh, the er, the
delays in cheque submission, I was just looking at the time, see how much time we have, that's all.
Right, let's um, as I mentioned the 14th of March, let's, let's start with the 14th of March then. um,
now then, 14th of March, if you look on that schedule there, right, on MP3, you can see there's
three transactions on the 14th of March,
