Thanks - that all makes sense. I think we do need to be in touch with Alice today to set out our planned course of action
(and BIS too). I am adding Jane to this chain. More than anything we shouldn't allow JA to create an exaggerated
response. We should feel confident that our position would head off a UQ.

We will also speak to BIS to let them know of the potential for a UQ.

All, we did not think JA would go to Alice until such time as Paula had responded.

Having discussed here we think that as Paula is away, she should suggest he meets Chris to discuss his
concerns as Chris is the responsible Director. I am happy to discuss with Paula and then explain to Alice
that this is in hand and she should respond accordingly.

Grateful for views.

The good faith issue is one we should challenge strongly.

Best wishes

Dear Alice

Tam becoming increasingly worried about how the sub-Postmasters mediation process is
working. The Post Office is treating the decision as to whether individual cases should go
through to mediation as a legal battlefield, to the extent that I am getting close to asking
another Urgent Question in the House of Commons about it. I have requested a meeting with
Paula, who I know is on leave this week. My office is receiving requests for me to talk to the
media, and I intend to do so, but I want to discuss matters with Paula first, if possible. I,

the subpostmasters and Second Sight agreed to this process in the expectation that it would be
carried through in good faith. I would hate to be in a position of having to call that into
question.

Tam sorry to write in these terms, but I felt you needed to know how serious the matter was
becoming.

Yours ever

James
