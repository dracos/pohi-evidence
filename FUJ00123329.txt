Juliet,

With most of the calls to HSD the terminology that they use to close the calls is difficult for the non technical person to
understand. What I have done in the past is to add a brief description of how the call was resolved. I have done this with
these 5 calls (see attached) and added; "along with a brief explanation of how the call was resolved" to the
statement.

Is this acceptable ??

Sorry to trouble you t

Regarding the schedule forwarded, does the original log include an entry as to advice given, ie how the query should be
resolved if so this should be included on the extract.

Hi Juliet,

I am not quite sure what you are after The required call data is over a year old so is archived onto a database, the
retrieved call data comes to us in an excel spreadsheet format which is complicated and difficult to interpret to say the
least. (See example attached).

We had agreed with Post Office to supply the raw call details in the spreadsheet format on a CD. Do you want us to print
the spread sheet and supply that as an exhibit ?

Please ring me if needed..

Gary

Andy needs to produce an extract from the CD of the five calls (exhibit APD/2).

As there are only 5 calls the reference in the statements can remain but must be supported by the extract

The reason why Andy cannot simply refer to the calls in his statement is that they are not something he has knowledge of
without reference to the CD.

Is the OIC confident that he can answer Qs about how Horizon works? Otherwise another
"expert" may be needed.

Can we show that there were no errors on the system at this SPO which could have led to
faulty software?

We need an NAE describing D's prior experience in PO and as a trainer.

Can OIC make a further statement setting out

1. the nature of error notices and transactional corrections (if different),

2. the effects of not removing any surplus,

the need to check the cash on hand each day,

the need to find discrepancy if found that day,

the need to count cash paid in at time of deposit (like banks),

the storage of trading statements at each branch and the fact that there were none on
and at the search (so D has hidden them) and

. the number of daily transactions is 700-800 not 2000-3000

I appreciate much is covered already, but this should concentrate our minds on relevant
matters arising out of the defence report.
