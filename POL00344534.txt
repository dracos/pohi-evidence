Background’ \ Programme \ Programme\ Performance:
Conte: Governance / Plan Dashboard
Risk/Issue n(s) / Update cod

There is a risk that the JFSA
&/or Second Sight disengage
from the Working Group over
the scope of Second Sights
role or the terms of reference
for the Working Group

Second Sight and JFSA
consider the scope of Second
Sight work to extend beyond
the Scheme and in any event,
have taken a very wide view of
Second Sight's investigatory
role within the Scheme

PV will be engaging AH directly before the next face-to-face
Working Group.

Post Office have reviewed all published materials; so far
there are no grounds to justify increasing the scope of the
Working Group.

Aletter of engagement has been drafted. Second Sight
have declined to sign the current draft and have asked for a
number of amendments to be made. Post Office is
considering these.

CA has opened discussions to consider engaging an
alternative accountancy firm.

Apaper will be drafted for ExCo, for onward transmission to
the Board on the Scheme in general, covering the
heightened risk and contractual relationship with Second
Sight.

6. Second Sight Engagement (2)

» \ Programme \ Pro me\ Performance Key Ri:
Govemance / Plan Dashboard / & Iss

Second Sight engagement has been challenging and looks to be reaching
a decision point.

* Second Sight have refused to sign the terms of engagement that Post Office
have proposed including the Board condition that they will not act against
Post Office in the future

* Post Office is spending approximately £30,000 per month (£0.5M to date)
and has only had one product — the interim report

+ Four initial case reports originally due in January have not be delivered
delaying the progression of these cases through the Scheme

+ Second Sight continue to seek to widen the scope of their engagement
across Post Office and will not agree to focus solely on the Scheme

+ Second Sight capacity is limited (3 members of staff) and we have no
assurance that they can cope with the coming workload.

Scope of the Working Group

Post Office has always been clear that the Working Group's role is to
ensure the Scheme is run in a fair and efficient manner. It will also be
involved in making decisions on how particular cases should be managed
through the Scheme only

Working Group (at the suggestion of JFSA and Second Sight) is seeking a
much wider scope allowing it to examine any issues that it sees as
relevant across Horizon and Post Office’s business

The wider scope carries increased risk for Post Office as any attempt to
restrict the scope will be met with hostility and accusations of attempting to
fetter the independence of the process

Post Office cannot allow the scope creep particularly given the challenges
around controlling the engagement with Second Sight

This is likely to lead to confrontation.

In addition to our focus on Second Sight and JFSA we are taking
forward two other key strands of engagement:

James Arbuthnot and other interested MPs — Paula and Alice held a
positive meeting with James Arbuthnot. A follow up meeting is being
arranged for Mid March with James and other interested MPs.

Anthony Hooper (Chair of the Working Group) — Given the challenges
posed by the other members of the Working Group maintaining strong
relations with Tony will be critical. Paula is going to meet with him in the next
few weeks to ensure we are well placed should relations with JFSA or
Second Sight deteriorate further
