Symptoms

A cash declaration was made in "Stock Balancing" for the amount displayed on the Snapshot. When the Cash Variance was
checked afterwards a Gain of £45.05 was displayed.<br/><br/>****<br/>May get PMs calling in to stating that they've been
declaring cash but have been getting varying discrepancies reported even though they've been declaring the same amount of
cash each time. Or that they have done a transfer but are then getting a discrepancy equal to the amount of the transfer, or
that the system hasn't transferred the cash out of the stock unit.

Problem

The underlying problem is that we cache the current trading position for a Stock Unit and rely on a mechanism (in Riposte)
to notify us of new transactions across the outlet to keep this cache up to date.<br/><br/>When this fails it affects
Discrepancy, Variance and Balance Reports and has the effect of presenting the clerk with incorrect information. This will
be potentially confusing and may lead to the clerk making unnecessary corrections. These will in turn show up as future
inconsistencies (eg nothing gets lost in the end).

Solution - ATOS

<b>Helpdesk:</b><br/>The Declare Cash problem clears itself overnight. If the PM logs a call on the day he is having
problems, ask him to try the following workaround:<br/><br/>1. The clerk should log out of the affected counter.<br/>2.
Another clerk attached to a different (individual, not shared) stock unit should log into the <b>same</b> counter, declare
cash for his own stock unit, then logout.<br/>3. The first clerk can now login to the same counter and declare cash again.
The variance should be correctly recalculated. Alternatively log on to a different counter and do the cash declaration there.

If the workaround is not successful or the problem does not clear itself overnight, send a call to SSC, otherwise no call is
needed. November 2007: a fix is currently being piloted and is likely to be sent to the whole estate in January
(COUNTER_EPOSS 39_3 or later). If this problem is reported after COUNTER_EPOSS 39_3 has been applied, send call to
SSC.

Evidence

If there is any pattern of failure eg it is occuring on the same counter repeatedly .<br/>Can the audit log
(c:\temp\audit<day>.log) be recovered if this occurs please?
