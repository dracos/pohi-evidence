Please see below comments from Rebecca regarding the cash at this branch, it is Colin Woodbridge's branch in the RG post
code. What do you suggest we do on this one?

Regards

Nikki

Afternoon,

I have spoken to this outlet today regarding the high levels of cash holdings. This outlet pays out £2500 on average per week and
has been holding in excess of £20k since the beginning of the year. I have asked that the Postmistress returns at least £25k on
Wednesday, I do have concerns however as to whether the cash is actually there and believe there could be a risk of loss. I have
spoken to CIT and advised them that the office will be returning £25k. If possible I feel it would be prudent to physically check to
see if the funds are there before contacting audits if the cash is not returned on Wednesday,

I would appreciate your comments,

Thank you

Becky
