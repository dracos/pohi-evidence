2 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Programme Status Live Outlets Operational Counters

0" June 2000

Comments

The July SRB now contains the quarterly conformance data against each SLA for Q4 1999 and Qz 2000. The
format of the SRB has been agreed with Liz Tuddenham, POCL.

Horizon Systems Helpdesk: Telephony and Helpdesk Services
A significant improvement in conformance to all Helpdesk Telephony and Services SLA’s has been recorded
in June 2000. This is evidence that the ‘get well’ programme described in the June SRB and introduced by
ICL OSD is now seen to be working, Conformance for Telephony SLA’s is being reported in accordance to
contract, however, there is an even greater improvement in achievement taking into account the
introduction of IVR during May 2000. Both contractual and IVR achievement are shown within section 4.1.

System Service:
There is a significant improvement in the achievement of both Hardware / Network priority A and B calls

when compared to the results for May 2000. Thereby indicating that the ‘get well’ programme introduced by
ICL OSD is again seen to be reaping positive results.

Data File Delivery and Data Delivery:

The failure of outlets to communicate with the centre (non-polling) continues to be the sole reason why
transactions are not delivered to TIP, HAPS & BA and data is not delivered from ICL Pathway central systems
to the outlets in accordance with SLA requirements. ICL Pathway are maintaining a strong focus on
improving the support processes in place to resolve communication problems quickly to ensure a timely flow
of information in both directions. Since improvements were introduced in early May, there has been a
notable drop in the number of outlets failing to communicate with the centre for in excess of 3 calendar days
against an ever increasing live estate.

Both the ICL OSD and the non-polling process improvements will remain at a high profile within ICL
Pathway.

Comments

Performance Summary
65.0% of calls were answered within 20 seconds

96.6% of calls were answered within 4o seconds
97.7% of calls were abandoned through ring-off

Cause and Action

June 2000 highlights a significant improvement in
conformance against all Helpdesk Service performance
measures. This can be attributed to the ‘get well’ programme,
explained in the June SRB, which is now well under way
within ICL OSD.

Performance measures for calls answered within 20 seconds
and 40 seconds have been calculated according to the current
contractual requirements, which do not take into account the
effect of IVR. Therefore within this review book, May and
June 2000 have been shown as ‘grey’ (with the achievement
included), until discussions between ICL Pathway and POCL
have finalised any revised contractual position. Taking into
account the effect of IVR on these two performance
measures, the conformance value for June 2000 would be:

Calls answered within 20 seconds 96.0%
Calls answered within 40 seconds: 97.5%

ICL OSD will continue to effect measures to bring about
further improvement to our conformance.

Cause and Action

For information: Calculation of RDMC Reference Data, APS

Reference Data and OBCS Stop List Delivery SLAs uses the

‘Non Polled’ outlet report to identify when an outlet has failed

to return an ‘End of Day’ (EOD) marker to the Data Centre. If

this is the case, the outlet is assumed to have not received a

delivery of:

* APS Reference Data (delivered 1 day/month to all outlets)

« RDMC Reference Data (delivered daily to all outlets)

* OBCS Stop List information (delivered daily to selected
outlets)

CSR+ sees the automation of this calculation.

Where SLA conformance has not been achieved, this is
directly attributable to the ‘Non Polling’ of outlets where
transactions are not harvested from the counters and
delivered to HAPS, TIP and BA within the required

Cause and Ac

timescales. (See also above re: the calculation of Data delivery

to the outlets). This problem is now receiving priority

attention within ICL Pathway with the aim of reducing the

time in which an outlet may be allowed to remain in a

position where the communication links to the centre are not

functioning. Positive steps have been taken to address this
issue, namely :

* Process re-engineering that will see considerable
reduction in time to resolution to ensure that non-polled
outlets fail to communicate for fewer than 5 calendar
days, This will be achieved by condensing the resolution
cycle, introducing a higher degree of automation to such
areas as ‘counter health checking’, incident management
and applying a greater resource to the support units

¢ The creation of a root cause analysis data base that will
establish the main causes of non polling and thus enable
plans to be put in place to prevent re-occurrence

An on-going programme to ensure the non-polling of
outlets is managed, focus is maintained and the problem

is seen to reduce in impact as the roll out progresses
¢ Discussion between ICL Pathway and POCL :
¢ Re: the development of technical solutions to alert the
outlets that counters are not communicating

¢ Re: the recovery of marooned transactions in the event
that an outlet remains out of communication for an
extended period

* To agree reasons for non-polling which can be deemed
to be outside the jurisdiction of ICL Pathway to ensure
any affected transactions are excluded from both SLA
and remedial calculations

Since the week commencing 8 May 2000, we have seen
encouraging results with the number of outlets failing to poll
on the decline, with the live estate increasing in size.

currently being reviewed between ICL Pathway and PONU
Commercial. No data is therefore included in this review.

Cause and Action

The number of staff passing the PSA reflects those who
passed some needing more than 1 attempt. The number who
failed at the first attempt is 318

The numbers of staff trained outside the contractual window
have now been added. These exceptions were all requested by
PONU and authorised by ICL Pathway in the manner agreed.

The Infrastructure programme is now close to completing.

The process issues involved resulting in the low conformance

5 days of receipt

Comments

82.1% of business incidents were cleared within 5 working
days of receipt. (The definitions of ‘cleared’ being that
sufficient detail was supplied to PONU to allow reconciliation
or client settlement to take place).

Cause and Action
Out of 123 Reconciliation and Business incidents received in

June 2000, 101 were cleared within the 5 day timescale.

22 incidents suffered delays in clearance which can be
attributable to the following reasons :

Delays in obtaining corrective data due to resource being
allocated to CI4 testing

New incident categories being received which are taking
longer to investigate due to their unique nature, for
example; stamp redemption with incorrect increments
where settlement can occur in any denomination and
discrepancies within stock unit roll over

¢ Receipt of POCL incidents requiring access to archive
data

Process improvements have been implemented during the
latter half of June 2000 to improve the flow of incident
resolution information between ICL Pathway and POCL. The
effect of these improvements has started to become evident
with the conformance to SLA improving by 12.1% when
compared with May 2000.
