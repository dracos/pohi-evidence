THE POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF DAN O’MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF POST

OFFICE LIMITED IN THE POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

1, Dan O’Mahoney of 100 Wood Street, London, EC2V 7ER, will say as follows:

A. Introduction

1 I am Dan O'Mahoney, Inquiry Director at Post Office Limited (“Post Office’).
This is my first Witness Statement to the Inquiry. I am giving this witness
statement in a corporate capacity on behalf of Post Office, in response to the
Rule 9 request dated 19 September 2024 ("R9(62)"). I am aware of the steps
Post Office has taken to respond to this R9(62); as such, I am the appropriate

person to give this witness statement on behalf of Post Office.

2 I have aimed to include within this witness statement evidence relating to
R9(62) insofar as the relevant facts are within my own knowledge. The facts in

this witness statement are true, complete and accurate to the best of my

Page 1 of 12
WITN11760100
WITN11760100

knowledge and belief. Where my knowledge and belief, as set out in this
witness statement, has been informed by another person or by documents that
I have reviewed, I acknowledge that person or those documents. I have been
assisted in preparing this witness statement by Burges Salmon LLP and
Fieldfisher LLP (together "BSFf"), who act on behalf of Post Office in the Post
Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the "Inquiry"). I have also been aided by Richard
Crawley within Post Office’s cyber department who has provided technical audit
analysis required to respond to R9(62) in particular in (i) outlining the audit log
processes at Appendix 1 and (ii) providing the underlying data analysed in

devising the list contained in Appendix 2.

. Methodology

R9(62) refers to the document titled ‘Strictly Private and Confidential
Investigation Report: Pineapple’ (POL00460000) dated 1 September 2024 (the
“Report’) and requires that Post Office “identifies every person within Post
Office Limited who has received or accessed a copy of this document, including
the dates on which those persons first received or accessed it’. The Report
has a corresponding file name of
‘Pineapple Investigation Outcome report Final 4924.pdf’. The Inquiry has
requested that Post Office identifies individuals within the business which have
accessed or received a copy of the Report. Following analysis carried out by
Post Office's cyber department, I understand that previous draft versions of the
Report were received or accessed within Post Office on 2 September, two days

prior to the circulation of the final Report. For completeness, I have also

Page 2 of 12
WITN11760100
WITN11760100

included details at Appendix 2 of the individuals who have accessed or received
copies of the following documents with a file name of:

(a) ‘Pineapple Investigation Outcome report Final 4924.docx’

(b) ‘Pineapple Investigation Outcome report DRAFT.docx’; and

(c) ‘Pineapple Investigation Outcome report DRAFT_NB comments.docx’.

4 Post Office's cyber department have analysed the data in respect of the
aforementioned drafts but have not located or seen actual copies of these
drafts. I also have not seen copies of these individual drafts of the Report. As

outlined in Appendix 2, I have only seen a final version of the Report.

5 Following the receipt of R9(62), Post Office checked its internal email records

and confirmed that the following six individuals within Post Office had received
a copy of the Report on 4 September 2024, circulated by Nicola Marriot:

(a) — Saf Ismail;

(b) Elliot Jacobs;

(c) Neil Brocklehurst;

(d) I Owen Woodley;

(e) Karen McEwan; and

(f) Myself (Dan O'Mahoney).

6 A list of the above individuals was provided to the Inquiry by email on Friday 20

September 2024 in advance of the filing of this witness statement. This email

also acknowledged the additional ‘technical searches’ required to provide a

Page 3 of 12
WITN11760100
WITN11760100

response to this R9(62). Such technical analysis forms the basis for the

methodology in this statement.

Upon receipt of R9(62), Post Office engaged with members of its IT and cyber
teams to extract and process the Report's audit data, using standard audit
applications that are available across the Microsoft 365 proprietary application
suite (together, the “Audit Log Data’). I understand that these audit processes
are routine in the context of cyber security investigations which can also provide
for analysis and oversight on document data and user activity. Audit Log Data
provides an efficient means of compiling the required detail as to when, and by
who, the Report is accessed, modified and disseminated within Post Office’s
electronic data universe. This Audit Log Data comprises the basis of the review

methodology in responding to R9(62):

(a) Microsoft_Defender_DeviceFileEvents Log — searched using the

Microsoft Security portal. Search terms were limited to file names
together with a date range parameter applied. Results are exported and
searched across date limits.

(b) Microsoft 365 Audit Log — searched using the Purview web interface
targeting: Files, Folders or Sites across a search field with a confined
search data parameter of 2024-08-20 to 2024-09-20. Results are
exported and cross referenced as against DeviceFileEvents.

(c) Microsoft Security Explorer - Mail-flow analysis — searched using the

identified list of file name variants for the Report. For each variant, a

Page 4 of 12

WITN11760100

summary table of email metadata was export to Excel from the audit

log data.

Details of the relative functionality and technical scope of the above audit logs

are set out in Appendix 1 of this witness statement.

The Audit Log Data across the above logs was then extracted and assimilated
into a consolidated spreadsheet setting out log entries for the Report and its

draft versions.

. Response

The Audit Log Data is consistent with and supports the initial investigations
carried out by Post Office outlined at paragraph 5, above, as it identifies the six
Post Office individuals who received a copy of the Report. This further audit
analysis also identifies a number of additional individuals within Post Office that
have also received or had access to the Report by way of the Audit Log Data.
A list of all Post Office individuals who according to the Audit Log Data have
had access to, or received a copy of, the Report is set out at Appendix 2 of this
witness statement. This list sets out the individuals at Post Office that had
access to or received a copy of the Report (or previous drafts) as at 12:00 on
20 September 2024 at the point in which the Audit Log Data was harvested.
This document may have been accessed or received by additional individuals
within Post Office between 20 September 2024 and the date of this statement;

however, it has not been possible to undertake a rolling analysis or audit

Page 5 of 12
WITN11760100
WITN11760100

following this date. Separately, the Audit Log Data is limited to only those
activities within Post Office, and once data is sent to a non-Post Office recipient,
there is no way to track or audit any subsequent document access or
interactions. As such Post Office does not have sight of any wider dissemination

of the Report outside of its own data universe.

11 Post Office has not produced the actual Audit Log Data generated as part of
these investigations as such audit logs are technically complex and very large
(with thousands of line items of data across multiple tabs of a spreadsheet);
however, this has been retained should the Inquiry require it Post Office has
instead extracted and reviewed the Audit Log Data and has compiled a list of
the individuals within Post Office that have received or accessed the Report

and when.

Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.

APPENDIX 1: AUDIT LOG SEARCHES UNDERTAKEN IN RESPONSE TO R9(62)

1 This appendix refers to the three audit logs that were interrogated and reviewed
for the purposes of responding to R9(62). The following information has been
provided to me by Richard Crawley of Post Office’s cyber department who
assisted in carrying out this technical analysis which informed the methodology
and Audit Log Data to respond to Rule 9(62) and draft the consolidated list at

Appendix 2.

Microsoft 365 Audit Log

2 Microsoft 365 Audit Logs (sometimes referred to as Purview Audit, Unified
Event Log or Cloud App Security Log) provide for a centralised log of all
activities recorded within Post Office’s Microsoft 365 tenant which monitor and
track changes all data held within online repositories, including to the Report.
These audit logs are generated where a Post Office 365 account interacts with
the Microsoft platform. This includes (i) human interactions such as where the
Report is accessed, downloaded, modified, renamed or deleted; as well as (ii)
background and automated processes, including OneDrive background

synchronisation.

3 Post Office's cyber department also reviewed print event logs to assess
whether the Report has been printed to a different document format, most
commonly a hard copy print. No print events were identified to indicate that the

Report had been printed to hardcopy or disseminated further.

Microsoft DeviceFileEvents Log

4 DeviceFileEvent log data represents auto-generated file system events and
interactions recording on MS Windows devices such as user laptops, which
includes at the point of creation, access and modification. DeviceFileEvents
logs also provide for records such as where a document has been subject to a
Microsoft Outlook mail attachment preview. DefineFileEvents are recorded from
the laptop device but are stored online and are searchable with the 365 Audit

data.

Microsoft Security Explorer - Mail-flow analysis

5 Microsoft mail-flow log data provides a detailed, 30-day rolling record to capture
and track all actions and metadata across email activity. Technical
investigations for all cyber security incident matters can be carried out to search
across email attachments providing for detailed email mail flow tracking

analysis.

“Lyn Daniels is the Personal Assistant to Karen McEwan- Lyn Daniels accessed the document by way
of an Outlook preview function which provided for a DeviceFileEvent log entry. Thismay have happened
because of Ms Daniels having a shared inbox function by virtue of her role as Karen McEwan’s PA but
cannot confirm this on the basis of the audit. Following reviews across the Audit Log Data, Ms Daniels
did not directly access or download the Report in full.

* Previously titled “Pineapple Investigation Outcome report.docx’
© Nicola Marriott was the document author of the Report. This represents the first instance in which a
DeviceFileEvent was registered in which Nicola Marriott accessed and modified this draft version of the
Report after 26 August 2024.
