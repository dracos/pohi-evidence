All

I have drafted the message below for field teams which you'll see gives them the opportunity to feedback any specific
issues that we may want to pick up subsequently. If everyone is comfortable with this, we can send this morning.

Media coverage on Post Office IT system

You may be aware of some media coverage about the Post Office’s Horizon system, relating to the contents of some
confidential documents, and this may prompt questions from postmasters you speak to.

We are challenging the reporting of this matter as it implies we acknowledge there are systemic faults with Horizon. This
is absolutely not the case.

Although we will not comment on the contents of any confidential documents, after two years of investigation it
remains the case that there is absolutely no evidence of any systemic issues with the computer system which is used by
over 78,000 people across our 11,500 branches and which successfully processes over 6 million transactions every day.

If the postmasters you speak to have specific concerns caused by the coverage please let us know by email to:
communicaions.team;,

Richard Weaver I Network Communications Manager

Happy for Richard to consider best approach with you - and I think that is having the briefing rather than sending it out.
We've had no negative feedback from the network at all.

Richard - please can you pick up?
Thanks

If we had pushed messaging out, thousands of people who didnt hear the coverage would have been alarmed and
worried and I don't believe that doing that would be in anyone's interests.
