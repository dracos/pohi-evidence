Juliet

I can confirm that i attended Bell Yard and viewed the documentation. Firstly, i have to say that there
was considerably more than i had been led to believe. There were 7 boxes, containing a total of 91
ting binders.

In essence, the ring binders contained the same type of documentation, which i took from South
Warnborough PO on day of audit and is now listed as item 8 of the unused. This documentation is
generally the standard printouts, schedules, etc that each PO in the country would retain.

The main items that were contained within the ring binders were:-

Cash Accounts (Trial & Final)

Balance Printouts (Trial & Final)

Automated Payment receipts and Horizon listings

Cash / stock remittance advices

Cheque Remittance out Horizon printouts & Cheque listings

A &L Girobank deposit & withdrawal daily printouts

Personal Banking daily printouts

Daily cash declaration printouts

A4 sheets showing manual cash entries (as item 2 on unused)

Other standard daily printouts e.g. NS&I, Post Office Card Account

Standard weekly reports & summaries e.g. Postal Orders paid, Inland Revenue payments(Child
Benefit, Disabled Persons Tax credit), Postage labels issued/rejected summary, Green Girocheques
paid etc

Various miscellaneous documents e.g. POCA Vault Destruction Certificate, Monochrome TV refund
table, foreign currency undercopies, Fishing Licence undercopies etc

Letter re: authority to repay £3,191 loss by monthly deductions from remuneration and instructions on
how to remove shortage from cash account.

One or two items where it appears that they should have either been given to customer, e.g. Special
Delivery receipt or should have been despatched e.g. a pension foil for £82.22.

The documentation dated back as far as December 2002, which was prior to Mrs Hamilton becomming
SPMR. There was documentation covering most weeks up to the time of audit on 09/03/06.

The Cash Accounts prior to dates i had obtained, showed that between October 2003 and November
2004 the cash holdings were generally between £8,000 - £14,000. My Cash Holding Schedule shows
December 2004 - March 2006.

In summary, the documentaion contained within the 91 ring binders is generally the sort that i would
expect to find in every PO i.e. office hard copies of transactions, summaries, listings, schedules etc.

I did not find anything that would offer, in my opinion, any explanation for the £36 K audit deficit on
09/03/07.

Please note that iam now on leave until Monday 06 August 2007.

As discussed, 18th is fine. I will await confirmation of time, but 10.00 a.m. would suit me.
