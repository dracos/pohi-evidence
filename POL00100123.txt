Subject:Second Sight

Dear Paula,

Following on from your discussion with Belinda please find below the information we have about the original Second Sight
cases.

In their email to Belinda about their letter of engagement, Second Sight said, 'we are also continuing to deal with
the original 27 MP cases and 19 JFSA cases, some of which are not part of the Mediation Scheme. We have

been told that the MPs will expect us to continue to report on all of those cases quite separately from the
Mediation Scheme’.

We do not know exactly which cases this comment relates to. During the period of the Second Sight investigation there
were different figures suggested by different people about the number of cases which might emerge. The information we
hold, which we have not checked with Second Sight, shows that:

° 25 cases were raised by 22 MPs - all of these cases have applied to the scheme
. Second sight completed 11 spot reviews - all but one of these cases have applied to the scheme

. The JFSA website lists 22 cases but as they are anonymous we are unable to confirm if they have applied to the
scheme

o http://www. jfsa.org.uk/cases.aspx

We believe that not all of the JFSA cases entered the scheme. Just before the scheme closed to applications we
understand Alan Bates rang the 'JFSA cases' to encourage them to enter the scheme but that not all of them did.

T hope this is the information you were looking for, if there is anything else that I can help with do let me know.
Best wishes

Sophie
