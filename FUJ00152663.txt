Good News !

This has now set a precedent and will have a knock on effect with the other enquiries waiting in the wings.

Gareth J is aware as is Naomi.

You may have heard already but just in case you haven't ...

The Post Office has been completely successful in defending all the

allegations made by Mr Castleton. You will recall that he contended that no
genuine losses occurred whilst he was a postmaster and that any losses were
manufactured by the HORIZON system. The Judgement has entirely vindicated
the HORIZON system. Mr Castleton appeared to be stunned by the result and
did not apply for leave to appeal against the decision. There were

journalists at Court and it is possible that this will be picked up by the

media ........ hopefully.
