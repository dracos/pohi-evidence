Patrick
Pete's answers confirm the position stated in the first draft response.

I've considered adding more detail about the safeguards and controls around the BT process but this seems very
defensive so would not recommend it.

So... I've stuck with the first draft plus Mark's first comment. Mark — I've removed your second comment (about the
branch consenting to the BT as we don't know that this happened for certain in the case in question).

Updated copy of the response attached.

Kind regards
Andy

As agreed, I will look at a re-tweaked version when you send it. Suggest we then meet on the phone at 1645 to agree
and I'll send thereafter with a suitable closing line to try to draw this issue, and Part Il, to a close. I have a nasty feeling

that they are just waiting to pounce on something...but I don’t think there’s much we can do about that.

Subject: FW: Questions from the Call

Hi
The following questions came up on the call:

¢ — Pilot number of branches in Q1 2010

POL-0037522
POL00041040

POL00041040

© Still to be confirmed
=~ Would the transaction appear in the branch print out
© This type of transaction will appear in the branch printout
e Post Office want to see OCP 25882
© See document attached
e Describe process with controls for a Injecting Balancing Transaction
o See below

if the Post Office have a requirement for the Fujitsu SSC to update the Branch Database by injecting a balancing
transaction the process is:

Issue is described on a Peak incident (the incident reporting system)

Requirement for financial correction identified by Post Office and discussed with Sub Postmaster

Peak transferred from SSC to Development team to write required correction as a script

MSC generated and signed off by Post Office to provide audit trail and authorisation for change

Development upload script to MSC (previously OCP)

e §SC verify script as attached to MSC, download and copy to live system

* — SSC change role from read only to read / write access

* — SSC perform the data correction

e Any change would be a new transaction in the audit log and can be identified under a separate identifiable login
in the branch audit record. All existing transactions are unchanged.

© = itis Post Office’s responsibility to explain the need for the change and the change that took place with the Sub
Postmaster.

« During all stages above marked “SSC” one member of the SSC will perform the action while a second member of

the SSC will witness ("four eyes rule" ~ see WI}. Both names must be recorded on the MSC for audit purposes.
