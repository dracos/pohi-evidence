Penny,
Certainly not that urgent.

If you could get me a figure some time this week that would be fantastic. If it needs a lot of work then let me know.

Could we ask Penny to have a quick look and advise please? My initial view is that this is OK as a ROM request.

Amit,
As per recent guidance can you review the attached ROM Request and advised whether:
- It should progress as a ROM Request (in which case I will pass to Penny as she handles ARQs and is quoted

on the CR , or
- It should be responded to by a Feasibility Study

Penny, at this stage this is merely copied to you for information.

Please advise,
