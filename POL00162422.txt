>> V quick read out of minister meeting today which I attended with Al and Paula. More detailed note to follow:

>

>> A very positive meeting: the best we have had with a minister in Paula's memory (and mine). Very commercial and brisk in a
businesslike way. Very positive about the business and recognises social purpose (circled and ticked on her briefing paper).

>

>> Very engaged in FS and keen to know more on margins and product range. I suggested to Paula and Al afterwards that we build
this in to her session at away day. She is on a learning curve: very low awareness of some of our products but very engaged in
potential.

>>

>> She has low awareness of mails (and confused us with her RMG Delivery office experience - a bad one), so another good take out
for the away day would be a very clear and nuts and bolts description of the mails business.

>

>> She was very impressed with our engagement scores - "you are clearly handling the change well with good communication" was
her comment.

>

>> On Horizon she was businesslike but keen to know more about our approach - but supportive. "Handle it commercially" was her
comment. "Not sensible for ministers to get involved". She did though say it was the only issue she knew about before getting brief.
>

>> On NS&I she said there had to be a commercial case if we wanted to push it: she wants more on numbers and footfall, impact on
network etc..but was clear that commercial factors would be at forefront of HMT minds. Tim will link in with Nick and team.

>

>> On banking services her view was very much - if there is a commercial case, pursue it.

>

>> These are main points: very supportive of NT and overall keen to stress that commercial factors will dictate her view.
