Introduction

This document has been produced as one in the series of strategy documents reflecting
the processes involved in the implementation of the Horizon counter systems.
Specifically the document provides the high level overview of the processes required
to install the Horizon counter infrastructure in outlets targeted at release 1c.

Purpose

The purpose of the document is to describe the high level overview of the activities
related to the implementation of the Horizon counter system for release lc.
Acceptance of the strategy results in the production of lower level processes and
procedures which document the implementation programme in more detail.

Where related activities are documented in other strategy papers this document will
make reference to them accordingly.

Any changes to the implementation strategy will be reflected by change proposals to
this document or other related documents. At intervals accepted change proposals will
be incorporated in to new versions of this document.

Scope

The scope of the document is as follows;

e To provide a high level overview of the implementation processes for the Horizon
counter environment and provide direction to related documents associated with
the delivery of release 1c systems to post office outlets.

e To detail the implementation strategy sufficiently to allow production and
agreement of lower level procedural and work instructions resulting from
agreement of this document.

Implementation Overview

At release Ic the target outlets are summarised in Table I below;

Each of the environments are described in the following sub sections.

IGL outlets

The activities performed for IGL outlets apply to 10 specific outlets in the POCL
South Wales and South West region. The upgrade activities at these outlets occur over
a specified migration weekend, the details of which is published through upgrade
schedules. Site survey and preparation activities will be carried out using the
processes established at release 1b. (Ref. [1]) and as such are not discussed further in
this document.

Release 1b outlets

These activities are performed at outlets which have been installed with the Horizon
counter system at release 1b and are upgraded to support release Ic. The activities
include a swap out of the base unit, keyboard and counter printer at each position. The
upgrade activities at these outlets will occur during the operational day on a defined
working day (Monday to Friday). Some disruption in the outlets may be experienced,
in that the existing Horizon service will not be available, whilst the upgrade from
release 1b to release Ic takes place. However, during this period manual backup
procedures will be invoked.

The replaced items will be removed from the outlet using the packaging in which the
new equipment was delivered.

Post office environments

The Horizon counter infrastructure was implemented in around 200 post offices as
part of release 1a (IGL offices) and release 1b.

Initial Go Live Outlets

The IGL outlets were each installed with one counter system using equipment
specified for these outlets (Ref.[9]). The system connected to a dedicated Pathway
campus supporting the infrastructure which enabled the Benefit Encashment Service
across BT ISDN. The users of these systems are now familiar with the Horizon
environment.

Release 1b Outlets

The release 1b outlets were installed using the high level procedures detailed in the
implementation strategy (Ref. [1]). Horizon counter systems were installed as either a
single position or multiple position outlet, depending on information supplied by
POCL and determined during the Site survey process (Ref. [1]). The outlets connected
to a dedicated Pathway campus supporting only the Order Book Control Service
introduced at release 1b across BT ISDN. The users of these systems are already
familiar with the Horizon environment.

3.3. The counter environment
The Horizon counter equipment is physically installed in outlets in either a “Counter”,
ora “Back Office” position.

e A “Counter” is a customer facing serving position where day to day operations are
performed.

e A “Back Office Position” is a location and business profile which does not provide
a customer facing role but from which transactions can still be carried out. No
“Back Office Positions” are encountered at this release.

The number of counter and back office positions varies between the different outlets.

3.3.1. Numbering of counters

Counters in the POCL network do not use any fixed scheme when numbering or
labelling counter positions. For example;

1. Counters are numbered 1-x left to right as viewed from the serving side.
or

2. Counter positions are identified using letters of the alphabet ( A-Z as
viewed from the counter side).

To overcome this, the implementation strategy specifies standard labelling of counter
positions for the rollout as follows;

© Counter positions are numbered 01 - xx, where x is the number of positions from
left to right as viewed from the counter side.

e Ifthere is a back office system then it is always the gateway server.
e Numbering of positions is as follows;

(i) gateway server is always position 01

(ii) Counter positions are numbered 02 - xx

(iii) Open plan positions are numbered after all counter positions have been
allocated.

Horizon equipment installed at the counter will be labelled with the counter number
(See section 3.4). It is this counter number that is used during the auto configuration
system introduced at this release.

The strategy is best explained using a series of examples.

Example 2__3 counter position

In this example , three scenarios are shown.

The first is where the gateway system is installed at counter position 01. The ISDN
connection can be installed in the same area as the gateway system.

The second scenario is where the ISDN connection cannot be located with the
gateway system. In this situation additional cabling is installed such that the gateway
system still remains in position 01.

The third is where the gateway server cannot be installed in the target counter
position. This may be because there is insufficient room to install the office printer at
counter position 1. In this situation the gateway server will be located in the next
available position, however the gateway will still be labelled as position 01. This
scenario cannot be used without prior approval from the ICL Pathway rollout
manager.

Outlet Identifiers

In order that each outlet can be tracked during the rollout a unique identifier is
established. The identifier is derived from information relating to its location, as
identified below.

© The database reference for each outlet is a unique key. The key is an allocated
number in the range 1-40,000 which is associated with individual offices. This
reference is an internal identifier which is only within the database.

e An additional key is also associated with each outlet based on the FAD code ( the
Post Office identifier for outlets). The rollout project will refer to this code as the
Post Office Code.

Post Office Code format

The Post Office Code used during the implementation programme is a unique
reference which relates to the Post Office Identifier and counter number. The format
used is:

123456AAAXX,

Table 2
The format of the code and its use is explained in the following example
Example - outlet with FAD Code 123456 and 4 counter positions
The Pathway Post Office Code format for this outlet is
123456001.

This is the outlet identifier used in the rollout process. The identifier is translated to a
bar code and was installed during the Implementation process. It is this code which is
scanned by Exel during the asset information gathering phase.

ersion: 1
Date: 10/11/97

12345600101 - 12345600104

These codes were used during the implementation process at release 1b. The
identifiers are translated into bar code format and are installed on the Base Unit at
each Counter position. It is this code which is used during the auto configuration stage
of the Installation process (see section 6). For each outlet sufficient bar codes are
produced to allow for 24 nodes in the outlet. Each outlet is installed using two bar
code sheets.

The first sheet contains detachable bar code labels which are installed in a plastic
wallet attached to the base unit.

The second sheet is left with the outlet manager for safe keeping. This sheet can be
used during the installation or replacement programme should the first bar code
become damaged or lost.

If neither of the bar code sheets are available then the auto configuration process can
still continue in the outlet through the invocation of a manual procedure which is
based on the counter position of the Horizon equipment in the outlet.

Details of the production of bar codes and their distribution is documented in the Bar
Code strategy ( Ref. [5]).

Communication during the Rollout Programme

This section documents the communication strategy that operates throughout the
implementation programme for release 1c. To achieve this, working practices adopted

6 Outlet upgrade strategy
The implementation of release Ic to the post office outlets is achieved through the
preparation activities and the post office establishment activities. The strategy is
summarised in this section.
6.1 Preparation activities
Preparation activities are those carried out in advance of the installation day (day 0)
and comprise;
e IGL Survey and preparation activities
¢ Rollout data base activities
¢ Counter system build activities
e Auto configuration activities
¢ Communication activities
© User awareness and training activities
6.1.1 IGL Survey and preparation activities
The 10 IGL outlets will be surveyed and prepared using the processes established and
adopted for release 1b (Ref. [1]).
6.1.2 Rollout Database Activities
The rollout database is used during the implementation of release 1c. The outlets
implemented at IGL and release 1b are applied to the rollout database to facilitate the
generation of auto configuration files (ACF’s) only.
Control of the programme and generation of rollout schedules will continue to be
performed using Excel spreadsheets (Ref. [1]).
6.1.3. Counter System Build Activities
This section provides details on how the equipment that comprise Horizon
configuration are built, tested and packaged ready for delivery to a specific outlet. A
number of processes are involved to deliver this functionality.
1. Preparation activities
© Overshipper equipment contents are defined by ICL Pathway.
e Test routines are prepared and scripted by the Verification Centre
e Configuration scripts and parameters are prepared and scripted by the Verification
Centre.
2. Order activities

¢ Initial forecasts for Horizon equipment are provided to ICL Pathway by D2D.

e Confirmed orders for Horizon equipment are provided to ICL Pathway by D2D.
e Equipment is delivered to D2D.

¢ Overshipper requirements for D2D.

3. Collection activities.

e Equipment is packaged in an Overshipper

e Equipment is collected from D2D by Exel

These are described in more detail in the following sections.

6.1.3.1 Overshipper contents

The contents of each of the overshippers, also known as the Bill of Materials, are
defined by ICL Pathway.

6.1.3.2. Equipment test routines

All equipment is tested prior to packaging in the overshipper. The test scripts for each
item is prepared by the Verification Centre. Where equipment items have
configuration switches, or where equipment has pre configuration menus associated
with them, these are checked to comply with the Configuration Controlled
requirements. Again these are scripted by the Verification Centre.

As each Base Unit is tested, the correct baseline software is applied to the disk, which
also includes the Baseline scripts and configuration items. The process is scripted by
the Verification Centre.

All scripts generated for the test routines are registered with ICL Pathway
Configuration Management. As changes or amendments are made, these are
controlled through the normal Change Management routines.

6.1.3.3 Initial forecasts for Horizon equipment

Initial forecasts for equipment comprising the Horizon counter system are passed to
equipment suppliers by ICL Pathway. In order that suppliers are aware of the potential
numbers of systems required to satisfy the rollout, initial forecasts are obtained on a
weekly basis. D2D supply the forecast figures based on information from the rollout
schedules. These figures are converted to build figures which are submitted to ICL
Pathway.

6.1.3.4 Confirmed orders for Horizon equipment

Confirmed figures are supplied by ICL Pathway to equipment suppliers such that
confirmed orders are placed. The figures are estimated to be within +/- 12% of the
target. These figures are determined by D2D to ICL Pathway based on the Build
figures determined from the rollout schedules.

6.1.3.5 Equipment Delivery

The equipment items ordered using the process detailed above arrive at D2D. The
equipment is checked into the storage area and the confirmed numbers supplied back
to ICL Pathway. This equipment is used to build the target overshippers for delivery to
outlets.

6.1.3.6 Overshipper requirements and packaging
The requirements for overshipper types is passed to D2D by ICL Pathway.

The overshipper types are derived from information collated in a report format at
release 1b. To assist with build process the report provides a consolidation of all the
overshipper types required in outlets whose target installation date is 25 working days
ahead. This information is extracted on a working day basis.

As such D2D are presented with a requirement for a quantity of overshipper types as
detailed in section 3 built to a specified release.

As the overshippers are built in this release they are configured with generic
configuration information. This is applied during the build process using scripts
provided by the Verification Centre. Each overshipper is then labelled with bar-codes
indicating the overshipper type, serial number of the overshipper and the release
number. The serial numbers of the equipment stored in the overshipper is collected
and marked against the overshipper serial number. Asset data is thus collected on a
overshipper basis. This information is stored ready for use later in the process.

Once the overshippers are built they are moved to a buffer area ready for collection a
minimum of 10 days before outlet installation.
6.1.3.7 Overshipper collection

Exel are responsible for collecting overshippers from D2D ready for the Installation
Process and may collect the overshipper types for outlets up to a maximum of 5 days
before installation.

As part of the collection process Exel provide D2D with the expected number of
overshippers required for the forthcoming installations.

When overshippers are collected they are scanned using Hand Held Terminals thus
providing asset control of the equipment.
6.1.3.8 Equipment Spares

The Exel installation engineers are equipped with sufficient spares to support the
rollout programme. The following conditions apply;

e Where an item of equipment fails during the Installation activities only the faulty
piece is exchanged with a replacement item of the same type and release state.

The number of spare items is calculated at the start of the rollout programme. These
are based on figures provided by Exel and D2D to ICL Pathway.

Consideration is made for the management of the following;

e Recovery and replacement of failed items on installation.
¢ Recycling of spare systems during the implementation period.

© The use of spare equipment and systems at the end of the implementation rollout.

6.1.4 Auto configuration activities

Auto configuration is introduced for release 1c. The process allows the introduction of
a generically configured base unit to an outlet, where after installation the target
configuration parameters are applied automatically to the system. The configuration
parameters are also known as the personalisation details.

6.1.4.1 Overview of the Auto configuration process

When the installer connects the gateway server to the ISDN connection, powers on the
system and scans the bar code during the installation process ( see section 3.4.1)
sufficient information is configured on the base system to enable a connection to a
boot server system installed in the Pathway campus to be made. Should the bar code
not be available in the outlet then the outlet details can be entered manually to the
system by selection of specific keys*. Specific information relating to that particular
post office gateway server is downloaded to the system. At this point the server
automatically applies the configuration information and reloads.

After reloading, the gateway server then has sufficient information to establish a
connection to the Pathway management centre from which the full configuration file
(ACF) is downloaded. The server will then apply this configuration information and
reload again.

After the system has reloaded for the second time the server is fully personalised with
configuration information specific to that post office outlet and counter configuration.
The system is then ready for the secure phase of the operation to start. This is the Post
master logon. On completion, the server will then communicate with the Pathway
campus to download specific Riposte information. This process may take up to 15
minutes to complete.

Any additional counter servers in the outlet follow the same process except that the
first configuration information is obtained from the gateway server and the loading of
Riposte information is also obtained from the gateway server.

For release Ic the following will apply;

e Authoritative signatures collected on completion of the Horizon equipment
installation.

e Authoritative signature collected as part of the Horizon equipment acceptance tests.
Completion of the acceptance tests results in a telephone call being made by the
Horizon Field Support Officer to the Horizon System Help Desk.

¢ Only after completion of the acceptance activities will the Exel installer move to
the next site.

The Horizon equipment acceptance tests demonstrate to the post master that the
equipment that has been installed is functionally operating.

In Office Migration Activities

For release Ic the migration strategy involves the introduction of users in the office to
the Horizon counter infrastructure. This will be performed by the Horizon Field
Support Officer in conjunction with the Outlet Manager.

The migration strategy is documented in the In office data migration strategy for
release Ic (Ref. [6]).

After care support

The Horizon Field Support Officer will ensure that the outlet manager is conversant
with the use of training and support documentation and general use of the Horizon
system.

Handover to steady state

Completion of the acceptance procedures results in the hardware platform being
supported from Steady State. Notification to Steady State occurs 1 working day after
systems acceptance. This allows for full migration activities to have been completed.

Details of live outlets (those which have been successfully upgraded to release Ic) are
also passed to PDA and BA Data Administration Unit to enable the initiation of BES
card distribution.

upgraded initially to release 1c. The upgrade activities are carried out in conjunction
with Pathway campus migration activities and are co-ordinated from a central point.
The activities involve demonstration to PDA that all Pathway campus migration
activities have been completed and involve the use of Volunteer customers using BES
and OBCS functionality. Only on authority from the central control point will the
upgrade activities at all remaining IGL outlets commence.

Should regression to existing environment be required then this will be authorised
from the central control point’. This will involve the de-commissioning of the release
lc environment and re installation of the existing IGL equipment.

Release 1b outlets

The upgrade of release 1b outlets will occur over a pre defined period agreed with
PDA. These activities will occur after the upgrade activities for the IGL outlets. As
such the Pathway campus (and therefore application components) will have already
been through acceptance processes.

Two outlets are identified to be upgraded initially to release 1c. In one of the outlets
Volunteer customers will be used to demonstrate the correct operation of OBCS and
BES functionality. The activities are co-ordinated from a central control point®. Only
on authority from the central control point will the upgrade activities commence on a
predefined date in the remaining outlets.

The following regression facility will operate for the release 1b outlets. These will
only be initiated on the authority of the central control point® and only apply to outlets
which have been upgraded to release Ic.

e Swap out of the release Ic equipment and re-installation of the release 1b
equipment. The existing equipment will be stored initially in the installers vehicle
in an marked overshipper and then in a local bonded store.

e Throughout the upgrade programme. overshippers used to remove the equipment
from outlets is clearly labelled with the outlet name and counter position. These are
stored at an agreed bonded store, such that if regression to release 1b at the outlet is
required, (as initiated from the central control point) the overshippers can be used
to revert the equipment back to a 1b outlet.

e In exceptional circumstances, which are to be established between ICL Pathway
and PDA, outlets which fail to migrate before a pre defined date may remain at
release 1b. The authority and approval for this will be sought through the central
control point.

6.4 Implementation Management
The implementation of the Horizon Counter infrastructure is controlled by the
Pathway Implementation Team. This section provides an overview of how the
implementation programme is managed and covers the following topics.
¢ Structure of the Pathway Implementation Team
e¢ Management of change
© Management of “Drop Offs”
6.4.1 Structure of the Pathway Implementation Team.
The Pathway Implementation Team has been constructed to cover all aspects of the
Horizon Counter infrastructure rollout activities.
The delivery of a Horizon Counter system to an Outlet involves the inter-working of a
number of Organisations and teams under the control of the Pathway Implementation
Team. Each are responsible for a specific set of activities which collectively result in
the successful implementation of the counter system.
Organisations involved are;
e D2D - who are responsible for the testing and packaging of the Horizon Counter
equipment.
¢ Peritas - who are responsible for the delivery of training and users awareness
events.
¢ Workplace Technologies Ltd - who are responsible for providing the infrastructure
within the Outlet to support the Horizon Counter equipment in the IGL outlets.
e Energis - who are responsible for providing the communication infrastructure.
e ICL SORBUS / EXEL - who are responsible for installation of the equipment
within an Outlet.
e Verification Centre - who are responsible for the management of software and
hardware baselines and the production of D2D build scripts.
e ICL Pathway who are responsible for management of the implementation
programme and the interface with PDA and POCL.
e¢ PDA and POCL, who are responsible for managing the interface between ICL
Pathway and the implementation of the Horizon infrastructure for the Post Office
and Benefits Agency.
6.4.2 Management of Change in the programme
During the implementation programme, changes will occur to planned activities.
Changes are controlled through the rollout change management system, which is
based on the standard ICL Pathway / POCL change management system and is fact a
separate system developed purposely for the quick turn around of implementation

activities. As changes to dates in schedules, impact initially teams involved in the
rollout program, the circulation lists are limited to PDA, RLM’s, ICL Pathway
Implementation Team and suppliers. The change management process also involves
the establishment of a Change Review Board for the implementation process.

Interfaces and Escalation Routes.

Management of the implementation programme is dependant on the establishment of
good communication interfaces. When problems are encountered escalation routes are
required such that sufficient management focus is applied to the problem area to
determine the correct resolution.

To achieve this problems encountered during the implementation are managed

Management of “drop offs”

Drop offs are those outlets encountered at release le which cannot be implemented
within the agreed timescales. Successful implementation is dependant on co-operation
between post office outlet managers, POCL RLM’s and the Pathway implementation
team.

The implementation of release Ic at the IGL outlets is scheduled over a specified
weekend. Communication of the activities is a PDA responsibility with assistance
from Pathway. Should one of the IGL outlets not be available over the specified
weekend, this will result in delay to the implementation programme. PDA are
responsible for ensuring availability and access to the outlets for these activities over
the specified weekend.

The implementation of release Ic in release 1b outlets is scheduled over a 10 working
day period. PDA are responsible for communicating to outlet managers that access
will be required over this scheduled period. Where problems are encountered during
the scheduling phase of the programme, the outlet will be referred to POCL RLM’s
and Pathway IPM’s for resolution.

7 Data Centres

The Horizon Counter infrastructure for release 1c is supported from the Pathway
campus based primarily at Wigan. Replicated builds of the main operational
components (Correspondence Server, Agent Machine & Router) are available on
standby in the event of major problem. The equipment used is that used through the
Model Office Rehearsal and Test.

At the end of the Model Office Test the Pathway campus components are cleared
ready for operational use. The service will then be transferred from a test service to a
live service and the 190 offices for release 1b will be connected to the Pathway
campus using ISDN.

The Pathway campus used to support the IGL and release 1b systems will relinquish
the equipment which after secure procedures have been applied will be recycled for
use later in the programme.
