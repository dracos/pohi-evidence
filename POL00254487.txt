Subject: 100 Technical Horizon Documents

Attachment: RE: Post Office Group Action - Known Error Log and technical documents [BD-
4A.FID26896945]

Jane, Tom & Rod,

I have made a mistake. The 100 technical documents specifically requested by Freeths have already been disclosed.
This was on my instruction to WBD, subsequent to my meeting with Rob and David and receiving the attached email
from David.

Wrongly, I had not thought this was a decision that needed to go to SteerCo.

I had hoped that I would be able to delay the disclosure, pending the ‘reputational review’ that was requested at this
afternoon’s Steerco, but having since asked Amy (who was not aware during Steerco) to check whether or not these
documents have in fact already been disclosed - she has confirmed that they have been.

Amy did mention that WBD have already read through the 100 documents (reviewing them for privileged material)
and that they do not believe there is anything included in the reports that is reputationally damaging. That said, Amy

does want to re-review 12 documents and this will be completed tomorrow morning.

I have asked WBD to share amongst this distribution list, any items included in these 12 documents that they believe
could, upon further review, be reputationally damaging to Post Office.

Depending upon what is flagged by WBD, I will work this through with Comms, WBD and SteerCo as required.
This mistake sits squarely with me.
Once again, sorry

Mark
