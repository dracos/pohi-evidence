POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF BARBARA LONGLEY

|, BARBARA LONGLEY, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
“Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request No 1 dated 12 July

2022 (the “Request’).

PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND

2. | held 3 Secretarial roles in ICL Retail in 1980s.
About 1992 | was a Visits Executive arranging site visits, travel, accommodation,
entertainment for potential overseas customers,
About 1996 | joined SSC as SSC Co-ordinator

(I can see now from the documents sent that | actually joined on 23/1/1998)

3. My role in relation to Pathway/Horizon was assigning calls off the PINICL to
technicians in the team. | had learnt which technician dealt with each situation.
| can’t remember exactly what was involved with the process now it was so long
ago, but | would basically move the call from my call stack to the technician's

stack. | knew it was the right technician for the reason above and no complaints.

4. SSC was the name given to the team. My role was arranging rotas, Annual
Leave records, photocopying, scheduling appraisals, stationery, post and

generally looking after needs of the team. Also assigning calls to technicians.

5. The training | received involved sitting beside Hazel Salvat each day for several

weeks until she was satisfied that | was able to do the job.

PinlICLs, PEAKs and KELs

6. | cannot explain any of that as | was not a technician and cannot remember
after all this time. | do remember that a KEL was a database kept by the

technicians for when they solved a problem others could refer to that solution.

7. | don’t think | was the actual administrator for the PINICL system as | had no
technical knowledge of any of the systems, | just allocated the calls to

technicians.

8. | have considered WITN0450_01/1 and | have no idea what Privilege Plus was

but | think it probably gave me access to the call logging system.

9. Calls were assigned to an available technician in team specialising in that
particular problem. The allocation was effective because the call got dealt with

by correct person on time with no complaints.

10.1 cannot recall there being any particular challenges to allocating the calls.

11.The system for resolving issues seemed effective to me because | didn’t know
any different and it would not have been up to me to change anything not being

a technician or someone who would make changes.

12.1 cannot remember now whether an issue was defined as an ICL issue or a

Post Office one. | am not even sure whether | would have made this decision.

13.1 cannot honestly remember now who the development team were or even
where they were located. This was 17 to 27 years ago! | think this question not
relevant to my role anyway. Someone higher up would know all about

relationships, not me.

14. It was not part of my role to resolve or close issues or attribute them to user
error. It was up to technicians, managers and above, to tell you impacts and

who was involved.

15.| have considered WITN0450_01/2 to WITN0450_ 01/7. | would not have known
how common complaints regarding missing transactions or similar errors were.

Technicians and above, who might keep statistics, would.

16.1 can’t recall any change in complaints, and | didn’t keep records, so | don’t

know.

17.1 can’t recall any issues standing out but the technicians and above would be

more likely to know.

18.1 did not decide whether to close calls, that was technicians and above.

19.1 had no contact with users.

20.1 don’t believe | was involved in the Horizon Roll Out, so | don’t have any opinion

on it.

GENERAL

21.My predessessor Hazel Salvat trained me well and | was as confident as | could

be knowing | had people | could ask for help if required.

22.1 don’t believe | was involved in the Horizon Roll Out, so | don’t have any opinion

on it.

23.1 retired Sept 2005. It would have been earlier but had to stay on to train my
successor. | cannot remember her name after all this time but think it was

Lorraine somebody.

24.1 had no reason during my time to think anything negative about Horizon. |

don’t think | gave it much thought really.

25.Naming individuals on performance would not be something | would do or have
a true opinion of, it would be down to the manager or above who did appraisals
for instance. | cannot remember names of hardly anyone | worked with after all

this time.

26.It would be much more relevant to put these questions to the technicians and
higher ups who knew what went on in the background. From looking at these
new documents, the date | was set up with access would have been the date |

joined. From that date, whilst still in training, until May 1998, all narrative on

calls was dictated to me by my predecessor Hazel Salvat. | worked in a non
technical, more clerical role from 17 to 27 years ago and am 77 years old now
with a very poor memory of those long forgotten days. | cannot contribute

anything useful to your inquiry.

Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
