POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANTHONY OPPENHEIM

I, MR ANTHONY OPPENHEIM, will say as follows:

1. This witness statement is made to clarify and supplement the oral evidence I
provided to the Inquiry on 26 October 2022.

2. In particular, this witness statement seeks to clarify and supplement two
sections of my oral evidence. The information contained in this supplemental
witness statement is based on my own reflection of my oral evidence. No further
information or documents were drawn to my attention following my attendance
at the Inquiry, including by Morrison Foerster, nor have I discussed the
substance of the evidence I gave with anyone or watched / read the evidence
of any other Inquiry witness.

3. The first section runs from page 122, line 5 of the transcript to page 124, line 2,
as set out below for ease of reference (emphasis added):

“Q. Thank you. Can we move to a similar progress report for January 2000,
FUJ00058189. You can see the date, similar format to before. Can we go
forwards, please, to page 26. The first bullet point at the top of the page: "The

outturn on Al376 was 0.06% Cash Account Discrepancies, exactly an order of

Page 1 of 11
WITNO3770200
WITNO3770200

magnitude better than the target." Obviously 0.06 better than the target of 0.6:
"Under this activity John P [John Pope] made significant contributions to the
Third Supplemental agreement, specified the committed CS Repair Facility,
aligned the operating agreement on Reconciliation to support the contract, and
sorted out the necessary PinICLs to clear." This reads as if it's a job well done
and that's the end of the matter; is that right?

A. No. It's a job well done, but it certainly wasn't the end of the matter.

Q. Why wasn't it an end of the matter?

A. Because we needed the detailed processes that were then written into the
third supplemental agreement and, subsequently, operational documents that
flow from that, so that the fact that he had made significant contributions to an
agreement that -- what was the date of this?

Q. January 2000?

A. I mean, the third supplemental agreement from memory was signed on the
19th, so I don't know whether this was before or after.

Q. It's just dated January 2000.

A. But, in any event, the work that went into that was very, very significant.

Q. Can we look forwards then, please, to the statistics. Can we just look back
a moment at POLO0090590. We see an email here at the foot of the page,
dated 6 January 2000: "In advance of tomorrow's delivery meeting, find
attached the latest spreadsheet that looks at criteria in relation to 376." Then
the thing that we're looking at, 376(i), a 0.17 per cent pass rate, so cleared the
ceiling of 0.6 per cent, and we see what happened to that by the time of the
undated report that we have just read. How far had the accounting integrity

control release contributed to this?

Page 2of 11
WITNO3770200
WITNO3770200

A. don't know for sure but I would say it was a major contributing factor.”

4. Having considered this exchange further since the conclusion of my oral

evidence, I now consider the response underlined above to have been incorrect
and wish to amend it as follows:
“No. The Accounting Integrity Control Release merely identified and reported
on reconciliation errors. It could not have prevented reconciliation errors from
occurring so could not have caused the number of such incidents to go down.
The order of magnitude improvement observed in December 1999 (especially
considering that transaction volumes would have been elevated by Christmas
trading) must therefore have been explained by other causal factors.”

5. The fact that the new Accounting Integrity Controls could only report on the
reconciliation errors identified and not have identified the root causes was a
point well made by Counsel to the Inquiry immediately after the response
underlined above. I agreed with him at the time.

6. I have given this matter further thought since I gave my oral evidence and
looked at the statistics to see if I could identify what might have caused the
order of magnitude improvement.

7. ICL Pathway Limited's (“Pathway”) “Service Review — Performance Statistics”
document for February 2000 dated 20 March 2000 (WITN0377_02/1) shows at
page 12 the following data with numbers of calls logged by the Help Desk with

respect to reconciliation issues over the period August 1999 to February 2000:

August 1999 29
September 1999 47
October 1999 65
November 1999 19

Page 3 of 11
WITNO3770200

WITNO3770200

December 1999 6

January 2000 7

February 2000 34

8. The following had changed, month by month, during that period:

August 1999 No Rollout and no Reference Data changes

September 1999 Rollout and Reference Data both resume

October 1999 Full month of Rollout at 300 per week

November 1999 No Rollout, few Reference Data changes,
bug-fixing software update

December 1999 No Rollout or Reference Data changes

January 2000 No Rollout or Reference Data changes (for
first 3 weeks)

February 2000 Rollout and Reference Data both resume

9. A moratorium on Operational Business Change (including in relation to
Reference Data) was routinely applied by Post Office Counters
Limited (“POCL”), starting in late November or the beginning of December and
running through to mid-January of the following year. Its purpose was to
minimise network disruption at a time of elevated transaction volumes. I recall
just such a moratorium being applied in 1999. It was the reason we were
required to complete the Rollout of the 1,800 post office branches (the first
phase of Rollout) before the end of the first week in November 1999 at the latest
(we achieved it one week early, during the last week of October 1999).

10.Except for emergency changes (e.g. a post office closing), no product or rule
changes would have been applied during December 1999 or the first half of

January 2000. In the run-up to the Christmas rush, it is likely that the number

Page 4 of 11

WITNO3770200

of changes applied in November 1999 would also have been down on the
monthly average. In addition, there would have been no new Reference Data
associated with the implementation of Horizon in newly rolled out branches
during that period, as none were rollout out in November 1999.

11.Reference Data errors could have been caused by any of the following:

a. errors in the data provided by POCL;

b. errors made by Pathway applying the data provided by POCL before
distributing it to counters;

c. problems distributing the data to all counters before the change was due
to take effect (either because the input was provided by POCL to
Pathway late or because Pathway failed to get that data to counters as
quickly as it should have done);

d. POCL not having provided sufficient advance notice to postmasters of
the impending change (e.g. where postmasters were not made aware
that they needed rem out tokens before a product was withdrawn from
sale); and / or

e. errors made at the counter following the change (e.g. because guidance
from POCL was not sufficiently clear).

12.As previously noted, Reference Data errors can cause cash account
discrepancies. PinICLs PC0032552, PC0031884, and PC0033363, exhibited
to my First Witness Statement at WITN0O377_01/85 to WITN0377_01/87
respectively, are examples of those that did.

13. The Attribute Checker (which I mentioned briefly during my oral evidence, see
transcript page 141, line 16) was intended to identify and flag errors in POCL

Reference Data such that POCL could correct them before they were

Page 5 of 11
WITNO3770200
WITNO3770200

distributed to counters. However, at the point where the POCL approved the
resumption of Rollout on 24 January 2000, the Attribute Checker was still in
development and had not been tested by POCL. POCL knew there was a risk
that, even with the Attribute Checker, Reference Data errors might get through
and that, if they did get through, they had the potential to cause cash account
discrepancies.

14.During my preparation for the hearing, I recall reading a letter I had written in
or around July 2000 to Keith Baines on the subject of Help Desk performance.
This letter responded to a letter from Mr Baines escalating to me that Pathway
had been missing its Service Level Agreements. As I recall, my letter identified
Reference Data errors as being a major contributing factor and reminded him
that, notwithstanding the addition of the Attribute Checker, under the Codified
Agreement “getting Reference Data right” was a formal Contracting Authority
Responsibility (“CAR”). Setting aside any question of which party was more to
blame, POCL knew that Reference Data errors were still occurring, with the
attendant risk to cash account integrity.

15. The second section of my oral evidence which I wish to clarify and supplement
runs from line 15 on page 133 of the transcript to line 11 on page 134, as set
out below for ease of reference (emphasis added):

16.“Q. Can we move, please, to the third supplemental agreement, FUJ00118186.
This was entered into, we can see on the top of the page there, on 19 January
2000 and, overall, would you agree that it defines, at a relatively high level, the
measures that were to be implemented to detect, report and remedy cash
account errors by various issues, including software faults, coding errors,

reference data errors?

A. I wouldn't quite characterise it like that. It is actually quite detailed and it went

into -- there's a table of, I think, all the known reasons for error at the time and

it wasn't so much to do with software errors. I mean, there was a process for

that. This was not to do with software errors. It was identifying, okay, was it one

of these or one of those and it set it out in very, very —

MR BEER: I'm sorry, somebody is drawing something to my attention. The
transcript had stopped so we had better stop speaking. (Pause) Can I suggest
that we take an early afternoon break...”

17. Having considered this (truncated) exchange further since the conclusion of my
oral evidence, I now consider the response underlined above to have been
incorrect and wish to amend it as follows:

18.“Setting aside the provisions relating to the Help Desk, the Third Supplemental
Agreement really needs to be considered in two parts. Schedule 4 sets out a
table of all Incident Types known at the time. Each of these was referred to by
both a TIP Incident number and a Pathway Incident number. The Incident
numbers were those assigned to the first call to the Help Desk of that Incident
type. The table groups them into Incident Classifications. The table sets out
how each instance of each type of Incident was to be identified and what was
to be done about them. The Notes below the table describe how that was to be
done. There were two classes of resolution: (i) Defences and (ii) AIC Detection.

a. Defences comprised (i) bug fixes, (ii) software code designed to prevent
user error (to be included in Release CSR+), and (iii) code that would
automate certain types of error correction (as provided for in Schedule

5).

Page 7 of 11

WITNO3770200

b. AIC Detection comprised (i) daily transaction data checks at the counter,
harvester and host and (ii) weekly cash account checks at the counter,
harvester, host and of “receipts not equal to payments”.

The results of the AIC checks would have fed into the Accounting Integrity
Control reporting. Separately, Incidents logged by the Help Desk which were
suspected as having been caused by a software bug or calling for defensive
software code to prevent user error should have generated a PinlICL. These
would have followed the 2", 3 and 4* line resolution path. Schedule 4 was
concerned with following through on the different Incident types at the Incident
level. Schedule 5 was concerned with correcting errors in transactions and
cash accounts that had occurred as a result of the Incidents considered under
Schedule 4.”

19.Regarding Schedule 5, the paragraphs in the Third Supplemental Agreement
that I was referring to at pages 139 and 140 of the transcript of my oral
evidence, and which Counsel to the Inquiry stated would be chased down in
due course, are:

a. paragraph 3.6.1.1: “Not Data Error means any of the following:

i. “an error caused by invalid data input by Users in Outlets (other
than the input of data which puts a previously balanced cash
account into a state of imbalance);

ji. an error caused by the input of erroneous data by a User during
migration of POCL Data to any Outlet (save where data migration
tools have been provided by the Contractor to detect such error
but such error is not detected despite proper use of those tools

by the User in question);

Page 8 of 11

WITNO3770200

iii. an error caused by Reference Data supplied by POCL which
result in Transactions not being correctly taken into account in
cash accounts where such Reference Data were correctly applied
by the Contractor in compliance with the CCD entitled "ICL
Pathway/POCL Interface Agreement for Operational Business
Change-Product" or, pending the signature thereof, the draft of
that CCD dated 13/1/2000, version 2.9;

iv. an Inaccurate Cash Account (Not Data Error); or

v. anerror which is classified in Annex 1 to this Schedule G01 as an
error of class "F" or "G", whether or not it falls within sub-
paragraphs (i) to (iv) above.”

b. paragraph 3.6.7: “Not Data Errors
The Contractor shall, promptly following discovery of any Not
Data Error, issue a report to POCL (in the same format as a
Manual Error Report) containing a brief description of the Not
Data Error to the extent that it can be identified and shall co-
operate with POCL and, to the extent that is reasonable, assist
POCL (a) to investigate and seek to prevent the recurrence of
such Not Data Error and (b) to prevent the production of Cash
Accounts which are incorrect as a result of such Not Data Error.”
c. paragraph 3.6.12: “Where the Contractor is required to make an
assumption in order to correct a Data Error and/or present Repaired
Transaction Data or a Repaired Cash Account, the Contractor shall
make such assumption and promptly inform POCL of the assumption

made.”

20.Whereas paragraphs 3.6.5 and 3.6.6 required Pathway to make corrections to
transactions and/ or cash accounts in respect of Data Errors and to issue to
POCL Manual Error Reports providing there were no more than 50 Data Errors
in that Data Error Counting Period (paragraph 3.6.5.4) or otherwise transfer
those corrections to TIP electronically in the form of “repaired transactions” or
“repaired cash accounts”, that obligation did not extend to Not Data Errors
(most notably Reference Data provided by POCL and User error). The onus for
resolving Not Data Errors was to lie with POCL, with Pathway supporting.

21.Paragraph 3.6.12 provided for the possibility that it would not always be
possible for Pathway to determine what had gone wrong and therefore what
the appropriate error correction might be, in which case Pathway was required

to inform POCL.
