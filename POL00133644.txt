1. . Introduction


I am Gareth. Idris Jenkins.                         I am employed by Fujitsu. Services Ltd who
have been contracted by Post Office Ltd to provide the Horizon systems
operating in Post Offices around the country.                                      However I understand that
my role is to assist the court rather than represent the                                               views of my
employers or Post Office Ltd.

I graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in Mathematics in
1973 and         was      awarded       an    MA    by Cambridge             University in            1997.    I     was
employed by ICL in September 1973 and have worked for that company ever
since (though. its name was changed to Fujitsu Services about 10 years
ago).         During my time with, ICL / Fujitsu I have held a number of roles
in customer Support, development, design and architecture.                                                 During the
early 1990s I was involved with representing ICL in developing Systems
Management Standards and in 1992 I was the head of the UK delegation on
Systems          Management            at      the       International                Standards        Organisation
conference          in.        Ottawa,       Canada.             In     the       late       1990s     I    become     a
Distinguished Engineer within ICL.                              Distinguished Engineers, were about
1.00 or so of the senior technical staff wit=hin the company (out of about
6000 to 7000 technical. staff) .

Statement of

Engineer (CEng) and a Chartered IT Professional (CITP) .


Since 1996 I       have been     working on the            horizon    project in association
with Post Office Ltd.            My initial role was in the integration of the
Riposte messaging system which is responsible for storing all data in
the Post Office branches and replicating it to the Data Centres.                                   I was
also   responsible for the design of                 the   interface       between      Horizon      and
Streamline which processes all Credit and Debit Card payments for Post
Office     Ltd.    More   recently I've been involved                 in projects associated
with interfacing data from Horizon to Post. Office's back end accounting
systems.


I have been asked to provide a statement in the case of Kim Wylie.                                      I
understand that the integrity of the system has been questioned and this
report     provides     some   general   information          regarding      the     Integrity        of
Horizon_


I   note   that    in   the    Defence   Statement         (CPI A    1996    s5(5))      there       are
comments about the Robustness of Horizon.                     Firstly, I am not aware of
the specific allegations regarding missing                    user information or phantom
logs, and so cannot comment on those.                 However, I would say that Horizon
has been designed such          that it does not break down easily and is not
affected by a single application failure.                     Also, Horizon does recovery
quickly     from    failures     and     does      hold      up     well    under       exceptional
circumstances and is not wholly affected by a bug in one aspect of it.
However as the report below shows, that in those cases where there is a
failure,    the    Integrity     of    the    data    recorded       is    maintained      and       any
discrepancies       resulting     from       the     failure        are    restricted         to     the
transactions being processed at the time of failure, whose amounts are
normally insignificant compared to the amounts .identified in shortfalls
of cash as found during an. audit of a Branch.

Statement of


I also note a comment made about it being possible to remotely access
the system.               It is     true that such                          access is                possible; however in an
analysis of data audited by the system, it is possible to identify any
data that has not been input directly by staff in the Branch.                                                                                       Any such
change to data is very rare and would be authorised by Post Office Ltd.
As I have not had an opportunity to examine data related to this Branch,
I cannot categorically say that this has not happened in this case, but
would suggest it is highly unlikely.

The       purpose         of    this     report             is       to      provide               some                 further                   background
information.

1.1       The Document Structure
Section 2 of the document describes the Horizon system at a high level,
giving       a    time-line            for         its          development,                     the            Business                          scope      and
Architecture              diagrams       for        both          the        original                Horizon                   System                  and    the
current Horizon Online system.
Section 3        then          summarises           my       views          on       the         overall                 integrity of                        the
Horizon system.

        •       Data Centre Migration 2009

        •      HNG-X Rollout 2010

 Horizon. Online (or HNG-X) was a major re-implementation of Horizon.                                                                                         It
 was a complete re-implementation of the business functionality at the
 counter                 and          utilised.            a      central            Database               to       hold        details                of   all
 transactions rather than the MessageStore used by the original Horizon
 system.

 All Post Office Branches migrated from the original Horizon to Horizon
 Online between January and September 2010.                                                              Historical transactions were
 made visible in the new system as part of the migration process.

2.2 Business Scope
The Business scope of Horizon is:
       •       Point Of Sale Application

       •       Transaction Recording

The replication process is designed such that should the data fail to be
copied immediately (far example due to a failure on the local IT network
within the branch or another counter being switched off or the branch
being disconnected from the dat.a centre), then further attempts are made
to replicate the data at regular intervals until it is finally copied
successfully.               Once the data. reaches the Data Centre a further
                                                                 copy is
taken by the Audit Agent which writes it to an Audit File which is added
into the audit trail where it is available for retrieval for up to 7
years.             Data in. the audit .trail is "sealed" with a secure checksum that
is     held        separately       to ensure              that it           has      not been              tampered             with or
corrupted.

Other systems can also access                                the data            from the            CS       Messa.gestore             via
Harvester Agents.                   However such systems are outside the scope of the
integrity of the Audit trail.

Every         record       that     is         written       to     the       transaction                log        has      a       unique
incrementing sequence number.                               This means it is possible to detect if
any transitions records have been lost.

while a customer session is in progress, details of the transactions for
that customer session are normally held in the computer's memory until
the customer session (often known as the "stack") is settled.                                                                    At that
point all details of the transactions (including any methods of payment
used) are written to the local hard disk and replicated (as described
above).            It should be noted that double entry bookkeeping is used when
recording            all   financial            transactions,               ie     for      every         sale        of     goods       or
services, there is a corresponding entry to cover the method of payment
that     has been used.              When a "stack"                   is    secured it             is written               in such a

way that either all the data is written to the local hard disk or none
of it is written..                 This concept of "atomic writes" is also taken into
account         when data is replicated                        to other systems (ie other counters,
external storage or the data centre).

The data for a stack will have been successfully secured to the local
hard disk before the screen is updated indicating that. a new customer
session can be started.                      Note that although an attempt will have been
made to replicate the data to an external system at this time, there is
no     guarantee         at       this     point        that        such            replication                 will    have             been
successful.            For example if there is a Network                                            Failure followed                     by a
Terminal         failure          there     is     a     slight          risk          that          transactions                   in    the
intervening period could be lost.

All data         that is written includes a "checksum" value (known as a CRC)
which is checked whenever the data is read to ensure that it has not
been corrupted.               Any such corruptions detected on reading will result in
failures being recorded in the event logs which are held on the local
hard disk for a few days for immediate diagnosis and also immediately
sent through to the data centre where they are held for 7 years.

Any failures to write to a hard disk (after appropriate retries) will
result in the counter failing and needing to be restarted and so will be
immediately visible to the user.

Whenever data is retrieved for audit enquiries a                                                     number of checks are
carried out:
     1 . The audit files have not been tampered with (ie the Seals on the
             audit   files    are correct)

     2. The individual             transactions                have their            CRCs checked to ensure that
             they have not been corrupted.

Transactions are carried out locally on the Horizon Online counters and
a Basket is built up during a Customer Session.                                                           Each transaction will
result in a Basket Entry consisting of one or more Accounting Lines.                                                                               At
the end of a Customer Session, when the Basket has been completed and all
Settlement items (or Tender lines) have been processed and added into
the Basket as further Accounting Lines, such that the total value of the
Basket is zero, the entire Basket is sent to the Data Centre as a BAL
Message          where the Branch                         Access Layer            (BAL) processes the message and
all the Accounting Lines are recorded and committed to the BRDB as part
of a single Oracle Commit.                                   This means that either all the transactions
within a Basket are successfully written or none of them are.                                                                       Once the
Accounting Lines have been successfully committed a response is returned
to the counter indicating this success and this then allows any receipts
to    be     printed.               The            Basket is        deemed to          be fully completed                           once          all
relevant          receipts have been successfully                                    printed.                      Note   that if there
are     no receipts             to            be    printed,        then     the     screen          is        updated         to show the
top le•v.-i menu indicating successful completion of the previous Basket.

at the counter using a                              key generated as part of the Log On process.                                                   it
is this audit record that is used. to provide the extract of trar,_3 -: rs
used for Litigation support.


Any     auditable             message               from      the     counter        is    stored,                 together         with          its
Digital Signature and other key attributes in an "Audit table" (known as

            concentrated into a                 small             number of these files for ease of
            retrieval.


At       this   point   a   check     is         made            that indeed                       there are              no       missing              or
duplicate        jsns for      any counter and                             should            any        be found                 an      alert is
raised.

            Note   that     this    could only happen as a                                         result      of a bug in                        the
            code or by somebody tampering with                                             the data in BRDB and this
            check is included specifically to check for any such, bugs /
            tampering.


These files are then copied to the Audit system where they are sealed
with digital seals.                They are held there Fora period of 7 years during
which time they may be retrieved and filtered to produce the relevant
audit data for a particular Branch.

The      audit record       may     also include                        application events                            that              have       been
accumulated at the counter since the last auditable message was sent to
the Data Centre.            All major activities that affect the Branch also have
an audit        of the data sent. from the counter to the Data Centre included
 n the audit log.

Each Audit record includes the following identification:

     •    Branch identifier (i.e. FAD Code)

     •    Counter identifier

     •    Sequence Number          (known as a Journal Secue:ice Number or                                                       ''sn)

no records missing from the audit trail when they are retrieved.

The     transactions in                          a     basket are                constructed                   using the                   principle of
double-entry bookkeeping.                                  This means that in addition to the Accounting
Lines           that         relate              to     the           actual         business                   transactions,                        separate
Accounting Lines are also generated for the tender items                                                                                  such as Cash,
Cheques or Credit / Debit Cards) , resulting in the total value of all
Accounting Lines in a Basket adding up to zero.                                                                  When the contents of a
Basket are written to BRDB a check is made that the net value of all the
accounting lines is indeed zero and should it not be, then an alert is
raised and the basket is discarded and an error response returned to the
counter.

                Note that               this         could only happen as a                                   result         of a bug in                    the

     for a number of cases where the Integrity has been challenged.                                                                  I am not
     aware        of     any cases where the Integrity of Horizon Online has yet been
     successfully                 challenged in court.

 The main challenges in the cases in which I have been. involved                                                                            were

                                                                                     my
 went           through. each              of     these        hypotheses and                  showed           that there                was   no
specific evidence for any of them in the                                                       presented.


                                                                                     data
 In summary I would conclude by saying that I fully believe that Horizon
will accurately record all data that is submitted to it and correctly
account for                       it.     However         it cannot compensate for any data                                          that is
.incorrectly input into it as a result of human error, lack of training
        fraud. (and nor can any other., sy.stem).
