1. [SET CHAPTERSTART"1" JINTRODUCTION

1.1 OVERVIEW

The Horizon Service Improvement Process is intended to give users the facility to raise
proposals to improve the Horizon Service. The proposals raised will be assessed and
may be progressed by PON.

This document describes the Service Improvement Process. The process defines the
way in which service improvements are proposed, assessed, developed and managed.
It also defines the way in which the Process interfaces with other PON functions and
processes._This document provides guidance for the development of detailed
procedures and for implementation and communication plans.

The Service Improvement Process forms part of the overall PON Business Service
Management methodology.

1.2: DEFINITION

Service Improvement - A Service Improvement is an-originala proposal intended to
improve, change or enhance an existing process, design or specification.

Service Improvement Proposals will be identified as “usability” or other. Usability is
defined as improvements which make changes to the way in which the Horizon Service
operates in order to make its’ use easier, more user friendly, more logical, or more
efficient, but without changing the fundamental design of the system, service, or
operating process. Examples are: changes to the order of the menu hierarchy, changes
to form design or wording, etc.

1.3 SERVICE IMPROVEMENT AND PROBLEM MANAGEMENT

Although both disciplines are concerned with improving the service, Problem
Management is concerned with actions to restore service to its ‘specification’, Service
Improvement is about improvements to allow the service to exceed specification. The
definition of Service Improvement should be contrasted with the definition of Problem,
below.

Problem - A Problem is an underlying cause which may result in Incidents. A Problem
potentially exists when a defect in the specification, design, production,
implementation, or use of any of the service components results in any aspect of the
service not meeting contractual specification [Ref. 3].

1.4_ ESCALATION

Should there be disagreements about the progression of Service Improvement
Proposals, in particular about their rejection, the issue be escalated within PON but this

POL00393957
Document Date: 14/1120/10/2 Document Type — L/001
000
Version 1.24 Reference No.: SRP/APR/001

should be considered as a last resort and the reasons for such actions should be

carefully examined.

Escalation is intended to bring increasing levels of management attention and/or

expertise to bear upon a resolution when concern is caused by;

e Time delay, or

e Failure to reach agreement on the progression or rejection of a Service Improvement
Proposal.

Escalation of cross-domain proposals should aim to escalate the issue to similar

management levels within PON and ICL Pathway where possible.

441.5 SCOPE

44415.1 Fit

The Service Improvement Process is a new process. It is additional and complementary
to existing processes for identifying and developing change, and is not a replacement
for PON change processes such as PIP, Service Development Plan, etc.

Contact points for the progression of Service Improvements will be established in the
relevant areas of PON. At present these include:

¢ Service Development Team

¢ Horizon Maintenance Team

¢ Internal Account Management

¢ Transaction Processing

Other contacts will be set up as and when identified, or as the need arises.

44:21.5.2 Coverage

The Service Improvement Process concentrates principally on an iterative and
evolutionary approach to improvement. It is possible that occasionally major step
change improvements (e.g. new services) may be identified within the process, but
these will be managed as discrete projects outside the process.

Overall responsibility for the end to end administration of the process will rest with the
Service Improvement Team.

The Service Improvement process caters for improvements to the Horizon Service, and
will be applied to:

e all Horizon operational services and, where these are affected by improvement
proposals, all their feeder, client and support services whether operated within PON
or by other service providers and suppliers;

¢ all Horizon infrastructure and environments including those of feeder, client and
support services;

¢ all Horizon related operational documentation at process and procedure levels.

POL00393957
Document Date: 14/1120/10/2 Document Type —L/001
000
Version 1.24 Reference No SRP/APR/001

The Service Improvement Process will be suitable for extension to other PON business
areas, systems, and services, as determined by PON.

44:31.5.3 Start and Finish Points

The Service Improvement Process will commence at the point that potential Service
Improvements Proposals (SIPs) are proposed, whether through Service Review,
network input or any other source. The directly managed process will cease when:
1) A business owner accepts responsibility for progressing the proposal.

2) The service improvement enters the Service Developmenttivery Plan process.
3 The service improvement enters the PIP or OBC process

3}4)__ The proposal is rejected prior to any of the events above.

Despite the transfer of direct responsibility for the proposal at these points, the Service
Improvement Team will continue to monitor and record progress of the service
improvement on the SIP database and produce reports based on this information.

The Service Improvement Process will cease altogether at the point that an
improvement has been implemented, or when it has been rejected for business reasons
and has been given the status of “closed”. Service improvement proposals will remain
open on the database until implemented. Records will be maintained of all ‘closed’
service improvement proposals.

451.6 OBJECTIVES

The primary purpose of the Service Improvement Process is to harness business
experience to achieve continuous improvement to the Horizon service and associated
SLAs.

A key secondary purpose of the Service Improvement Process, in conjunction with the
Service Review Process, is to ensure that users are empowered to influence the design
and direction of the service. This is particularly important in the context of PON
automating the customer facing business processes and concentrating on conformance.

45-41.6.1 Objective 1

To improve the quality, performance and resilience of the service and the levels
of performance provided to users, customers and clients.

45.21.6.2 Objective 2

To focus PON staff and systems effectively towards providing the greatest
improvement in service in the shortest time possible.

45.:31.6.3 Objective 3
To provide an efficient process for dealing with the small scale changes that will
form the bulk of the Service Improvement Proposals, that as well as progressing
them effectively will also protect PON from wasting effort unnecessarily.

4+541.6.4 Objective 4
To foster in counter staff and agents a sense of ownership of the Horizon Service.

2. PRINCIPLES

In order to meet the objectives the Service Improvement Process must follow these

principles:

1. Subpostmasters, counter staff and all end users must have the opportunity to raise
improvement ideas; the process must also be geared to accept proposals from any
other source:

2. Service improvement originators may be involved in the analysis and development
of service improvement proposals.

3. All service improvement proposals must be logged on a central database, and
progress recorded on the database. The database must provide a life-cycle audit
trail for every proposal that is logged.

4, The progress of service improvement proposals must be communicated to
originators and to the user community.

5. Service improvements proposals must be assessed against consistent and relevant
criteria.

6. Operational responsibilities for the capture, analysis, and development of service
improvements, and the management of the process, must be clearly defined.

7. Responsibility for the detailed analysis and development of a proposal is allocated
on a case by case basis, the allocation being based on factors such as technical
capability, resource availability, and the ownership of the business area that
potentially will benefit.

8. Service improvement proposals will be deemed to be closed when the improvement
has been introduced or has been rejected by the business.

9. The introduction of service improvements will be subject to Change Control and

Post Implementation Monitoring. F>N—duetothelack-ofa-comprehensive chang:

I HORIZON SERVICE IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL
Title Green Giro Milk Token Icon

Please give your proposal a
name.

Service Improvement
Description

Give a detailed description of
the proposed improvement.
Which part of the service do you
think should be changed and
what is the exact change that is
required to make the
improvement work.

Currently the Green Giro Milk Token Icon is
not on the screen used for inputting Green Giro
Cheque details.

My proposal is that the Milk Token icon be
moved to the Green Giro screen so that
associated milk tokens can be input at the same
time as the Green Giro details.

Purpose of the Proposal
Describe why you think the
proposal will improve the service
and what will be better as a
result of implementing this
change.

This should reduce the time it takes to carry out
this transaction and prompt counter staff to
issue milk tokens while the customer is at the
counter.

Benefits

What benefits do you think will
be achieved by implementing
this change.

This change should also prevent counter staff
from forgetting to enter milk tokens issued onto
the system and improve the accounting of milk
tokens.

9. APPENDIXC - SERVICE REVIEW PROCESS

This appendix gives an overview of the BSM Horizon Service Review Process.

9.1 PURPOSE

Service Review exists to help maximise the benefits of an automated network by
managing the quality of the service provided. A hierarchy of Service Review Forums
has been established headed by the Horizon Evaluation Review Forum and the Horizon
Service Review Forum, and supported by subsidiary forums focused on specific
operational and support services. The purpose of the structure of forums is to provide
quality management information to the appropriate people, to enable effective supplier
management and continuous service improvement. Service Review also provides a
clear structure for escalation and delegation of issues at a senior management level and
at an operational level.

9.2 SCOPE

Review at an operational level should be detailed and specific and focus on the relevant
service level agreements and operational level agreements. Representatives at the
forums should be close to the operation and able to:

™ report on the overall performance of the specific part of the service

™ identify and record associated risks, issues and problems with this part of the service
™ offer informed opinion on the service which can be escalated and easily understood
™ deliver delegated and/or escalated actions and ensure results are communicated

Review at a higher level will cover all aspects of the service and include:

@ discussion of SLA performance and action required to rectify failure

@ dealing with issues that have been escalated

™@ receiving information on the operational situation via reports which are produced by
each forum

™ delegating actions to specific forums

9.3. FORUMS AND THEIR PURPOSE
