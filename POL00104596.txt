Subject: 25 Fwd: Re: Horizon - Offices to be investigated
Keith

We discussed these two offices at our last meeting and you said you would send me the
information forwarded to Audits. I have not received anything to date and despite trying both
Chris Painter and Martin Ferlinc I have been unable to find anyone in Audits who has any
recollection of having received any information about them. I have received copies of an audit
summary for each office for audits carried out on 13/4 (Two Ball Lonnen) and 18/4 (Hazelrigg)
but these are really of no help and simply say the investigation is ongoing. It is now over a year
since these offices went live and we really do need to resolve these shortages (not surprisingly
the subpostmaster who has about 10 offices in my area is unhappy with what he perceives the
lack of progress). Can you please forward the information sent to audits to me and confirm
who in audits is dealing with this.

Thanks
Lynn

I would like it to include both as the errors in P&As occurred during the same period as the
shortages which the office is claiming are due to the system and which we think may be down
to in-house fraud

Thanks for your help

Lyan,

Thanks. I'll take this up with Pathway. For Two Ball Lonnen, should the investigation include
the £19,419 in outstanding error notices, or just the £45,431 authorised cash shortage?
