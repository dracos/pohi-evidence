Importance: High

Alysa — further to my updates on the Horizon scheme, note that it looks as if BISCom are inviting SPMs and POL to
sessions on the 3" Feb. I suggest that Jo stays clear of this if she can given that this is an independent scheme, but I
suppose she might inevitably be drawn in.

I haven’t talked to POL about this yet so will keep you posted. I would be grateful if you could provide us with Jo’s
views following my email of yesterday as clearly this may have handling implications for POL, although instinctively it
feels that the more conciliatory we are on this, the more the JFSA get to try and widen the scope of the scheme to find
a smoking gun which does not exist.

Please see below from the BIS Select Committee. There’s a certain inevitability about this.

I’ve spoken to the committee clerk. It’s a one off Inquiry comprising 2 sessions — 9.30am and 10.30am
on 3" February. “Sub-postmaster representatives” are being asked to appear in the first, POL for the

second. We can put up 2, possibly 3, people.

Please can we grab some time today to discuss?

Dear Jane,

The BIS Committee is having an evidence session on the Post Office mediation scheme on 3 February.
We’re putting together a programme of witnesses, which we’ll announce once confirmed. The
Committee would like the Post Office to give evidence at 10.30am (approx.).

Are representative(s) be available to speak with the Committee?

Thank you,

Jess
