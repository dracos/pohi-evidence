lan,

I sent an update late yesterday pm to Gary so he may have sent it on to
you by now, but here it is anyway.

At this point I'm concentrating on the Business issues, but I believe a
fix is being prepared. Once it is prepared it will be tested and
distributed in the normal way. I'm not normally in the loop for such
things, but presumably details of this will be communicated to POL in
the normal way (whatever that is).

Regards
Gareth

many thanks for the update

Please could you circulate a revised explanation that shows the correct

I'd also be interested in the "fix" to the code and test plans etc, so
please could you keep me in the loop
