Project Sparrow — Options
Assumptions and Constants

¢ Increasing the pace of the process is beneficial to POL in order to minimise costs and long term reputational damage.

e Mediations are currently proceeding at an approximate rate of 1 every 3 weeks. Under any option this will need to increase and be resourced.

* If adecision is taken to change the Scheme we will need to implement a comprehensive media and Parliamentary strategy (e.g . briefings, interviews
WMS, third party advocates etc).

e Under all options Post Office should anticipate public criticism — the variables are when and how long it lasts.

* We should expect Second Sight’s Part Two Report to be critical (however unjustified); and plan on the basis that it will leak if Post Office seek to
mitigate that criticism or block the report.

¢ Post Office do not anticipate the need to pay very large sums in compensation — thus far the average is £10k per case with merit that has been settled
whether through mediation or outside of the Scheme process. This is contrary to many applicants’ expectations.

¢ Thus far just under half of the cases that have gone to mediation have been resolved through that process. The more cases that are put through to
mediation, the more likely it is that that proportion will fall.

e 16 cases have been resolved outside of mediation (usually prior to Working Group consideration). We continue to look for opportunities to settle cases
with merit early but there are unlikely to be many more capable of resolution in this way.

¢  Itis highly likely that JFSA will pursue litigation against the Post Office under all options.

e@ = The risk of a successful Judicial Review is considered low on all options.

This would involve

are very low if non-

Delays probable

We could end up
mediating twice —
especially if as a result
of errors in mediation a
person successfully
overturns a conviction
~ we may end up
mediating for
compensation.

Will be seen as a
victory for those
campaigning against
POL and can expect
continued BBC and
trade coverage. POL
may be cast as weak
and in having accepted
their wrongdoing or
being forced to move
by Second Sight’s Part
Two report.

Cannot predict whether
any settlement offer
would be accepted but
unlikely in many cases
where expectations are
high and growing in the
face of MP/Select
Committee and media
involvement — spurred
‘on by Second Sight

However, timing risks
associated with
litigation risks ongoing
and probably increased

Legal advice from
linklaters against ex
gratia payment unless
linked to the Scheme.

Significant risk of
applicants aggregating
payment to support a
“group action”.

Media coverage likely —
and will continue, in
bursts, re the vocal
applicants continuing
“campaign”

Presentation likely to
be that of POL
wrongdoing (probably
fuelled by SS & P2) and
“paying out” to
attempt to shut issue
down (even payment
for litigation likely to be
presented as calling
bluff e.g. applicants out
of time, too distressed
for court process again,
won’t be enough
money

Potentially unfair on
the vast majority of
spmrs in the network
who have not
complained. Suggests
POL will payout if you
complain loudly
enough regardless of
merit

May result in a Flurry of
claims from other
spmrs (existing and old)
hoping that they can
get money.

May make existing

spmrs less inclined to
repay loses under the
terms of the contract

Criticism likely.

Possible group actions

Continued scope for
prevarication by JFSA
and Second Sight.

Continue to provide
JFSA with information
which could be used by
Edwin Coe (and others)
in litigation further
down the line

Likely to still result in
litigation if cases are
not resolved.

Continued flurries of
negative media interest
likely with a peak
around Second Sight’s
Part Two Report.

POL scope to respond
hindered by
confidentiality
requirements of the
Working Group.

Honours our

Lack of support from
NFSP who are now back
on side and ready to
support. Unlikely to
continue if we do not
take some action given
their views on the
erosion of the brand by
ongoing criticism.

Continuing in the face
of criticism may fuel
opposition.

New Minister post-
election could make
containment difficult,
particularly with 2" SS
report.

MPs (led by Kevan
Jones MP) continue to
campaign.
