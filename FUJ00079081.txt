Re: POCL Infrastructure Acceptance
Bob,

I now have a set of Acceptance documentation for you as follows: -

Version 1.9 of the Acceptance Specification. This proposes a number of
changes as documented in section 0.4. These are mainly the substitution of
more appropriate documents for review following the creation of the first
segment pack.

Version 0.2 of the Acceptance Reviews Plan which reflects the above
changes.

The first issue of the Acceptance Pack - Segment 1 together with the set of
documents as shown in section 4.

With regard to the comments you sent me on v1.8 I can advise you a follows: -

1.

Ref.(91), the E2E closure report in POCL Inf. has now been changed to be
CR/ACR/013 - the Acceptance Closure Report.

. CS/FSP/002 has moved to version 3 but hasn't yet been updated in our
library. I will show the baseline version in the relevant Acceptance Pack
segment 3. The title is as shown in the POCL Inf spec.

. CS/PER/013 - This document is updated monthly and is provided as an
exemplar of the type of data recorded. In that regard any version would be
suitable. The title is as shown in the POCL Inf. spec.

. SMC Core Processes for Service Delivery - the ref. SM/PRD/004 is the

Pathway library reference, the other being the document authors reference.

. DIT Closure Report - The reference shown in POCL Inf. is correct.

1. PA/STR/009 - The title should be Pathway New Release 2 Contents
Description

Finally, I would like to propose a change to Criterion 869/1 & 2 in section 5.1.2.
You may know that there are similarly worded criterion (885 & 887) in the Service
Boundaries Acceptance spec. The approach being taken here is to use the
document CR/REP/012 - Boundary Performance Methodology and for
consistency I propose doing the same.

Please let me know if you have any concerns with the above.

Regards,

Dave Cooke
