As discussed regarding Seaburn sPSO. Please see attached a slightly amended witness statement required
for court on Friday 18th April.

All I have done is increased the time period to a starting date of lst July 2005. This is because the
defence have requested Horizon data from the previous year for comparison. Therefore the amount of HSH
calls will more than likely increase from the 20 mentioned in the draft.

(See attached file: WS Seaburn 193343.doc)

A signed copy can be sent direct to either McKenzie Bell or to my PO Box address below.
Thanks
