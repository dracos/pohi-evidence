                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




              FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JAMES ARBUTHNOT




I, James Norwich Arbuthnot of Edrom, will say as follows...



INTRODUCTION



1.   I am the former Member of Parliament for North East Hampshire and currently

     a Member of the House of Lords and of the Horizon Compensation Advisory

     Board.



2.   This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

     "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 13th December

     2023 (the "Request").

BACKGROUND

3.   I have been asked to set out my involvement with the matters being

     investigated by the Inquiry, and in particular, a detailed account of my

     involvement and / or my views on:



     a.   the efforts of sub-postmasters, subpostmistresses, managers and

          assistants ("SPMs") in seeking to expose the failings of the Horizon IT

          System and to obtain redress for the wrongs they suffered as a result of

          those failings;



     b.   the support and representation that was available to those SPMs in

          pursuing those efforts;


     c.   the extent of any procedures available to SPMs to raise concerns and

          grievances with POL [Post Office Ltd] and the adequacy of the same;


     d.   the appointment of Second Sight, the ambit of its investigation, the extent

          of its access to relevant information and documentation and the

          termination of its involvement;


     e.   the creation of the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme, its

          termination and the reason for the same;


     f    the response of POL [Post Office Ltd] to the above, including any policies

          or strategies it adopted in relation to the same;


     g.   to what extent, if at all, Post Office Limited ("POL") or Fujitsu Services

          Limited ("Fujitsu") assisted or obstructed the efforts of SPMs to expose

          the failings of the Horizon IT System and to obtain redress for the wrongs

          which they suffered as a result of those failings;


     h.   POL's conduct of the Group Litigation; and


     i.   the mechanism(s) in place to enable government oversight of the above

          issues and whether they were adequate.




4.   First a bit about my professional career and my roles in Parliament.



     a.   In 1975 I was called to the Bar in the Inner Temple, and in 1976 began to

          practise as a Chancery Barrister at 10 Old Square in Lincoln's Inn.



     b.   From 1987 to 1997 I was the Conservative Member of Parliament for

          Wanstead and Woodford and served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary

          in the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry. In

          1992 I was appointed an Assistant Government Whip and stopped

          practising as a barrister. In 1994 I became the Parliamentary Under-

          Secretary of State for Pensions in the Department of Social Security and

          in 1995 the Minister of State for Defence Procurement.


     c.   In the 1997 General Election, the constituency of Wanstead and Woodford

          having been abolished by the Boundary Commission, I was elected as MP

          for North East Hampshire. The Conservatives lost that election, and I

          became Opposition Chief Whip from 1997 until 2001. From 2001 until



                                      Page 3 of 193
                                                                                     WITN00020100




          2005 I served on the Intelligence and Security Committee and from 2003

          to 2005 I was Shadow Secretary of State for Trade.



     d.   In 2005 I became Chair of the Defence Select Committee, a position I

          held until 2014.



     e.   In 2015 I stood down from the House of Commons and in October of that

          year I was appointed a Life Peer. In the House of Lords I chaired the

          Special Select Committee on Risk Assessment and Risk Planning

          between October 2020 and December 2021.



5.   I should start by saying that the issues with which I have been involved relate to

     more than an IT system — they relate to the behaviour of people in the Post

     Office, Fujitsu, the Government and the legal system, with the Horizon IT

     system being the backdrop of that behaviour.



6.   What follows has been reconstructed as to detail not only from the documents

     helpfully provided by the Inquiry team but also from the entries in my electronic

     diary and in my document folders. The facts set out below are within my own

     knowledge or are derived from the documents I have seen, and I believe them

     to be true. The process of reconstruction has involved my going through my

     electronic entries and looking at the notes attached thereto. Sometimes those

     notes contain documents such as letters, sometimes threads of emails and

     sometimes both. For the purposes of this Statement I copied them from those

     diary entries into a Microsoft Word document. I no longer have access to the

                                                                                   WITN00020100




original emails because I left the House of Commons on 30 March 2015, but I

believe the documents I have copied to be accurate copies of the original

documents. Some of the documents to which I refer were stored on the

computer of my former Chief of Staff, Janet Walker, and she sent me copies of

those documents but I cannot now remember how or when she did that. All of

those documents I believe to be true copies of the original documents. It has

not always been possible with the email threads to be certain about the dates

on which those emails were sent; I have simply done my best to be accurate.

One further important caveat is that the fact that something was in my diary

means that it was likely, though not certain, to have taken place as envisaged in

my diary; it is possible that meetings, telephone calls or events either did not

take place or were slightly different from what was envisaged, but, again, the

narrative below fully accords with my own memory of what happened.

2009 — 2011: INITIAL INVOLVEMENT WITH POL & HORIZON




7.      On Friday 3rd April 2009 I went to a coffee morning in Long Sutton in my

        constituency, and a local councillor from South Warnborough, Cllr John

        Kennett, told me about the case of Jo Hamilton. He told me that Rebecca

        Thompson of Computer Weekly was writing an article about it, and that she

        hoped it would be published that month or the following month. I already had a

        high regard for Computer Weekly as a result of their investigations into the

        Chinook crash of 1994 (which had led to a campaign which I and others had

        pursued to exonerate from the accusation of negligence the deceased pilots).

        CM. Kennett sent me an email of 4 th April 20091 confirming our conversation but

        it is not clear what, if anything, I did as a result of that conversation and email. I

        should think I probably decided to wait until the article came out and then, when

        I heard nothing more, I got on with other things,



8.      On 8111 October 2009 David Bristow, the former subpostmaster of Odiham, sent

        me an email2. He had just been removed from his position by the Post Office

        who were demanding he pay them more than £42,000. He referred to the case

        of Jo Hamilton, and also to one in the constituency of David Jones MP, that of

        Alan Bates. I probably then had an informal conversation in the House of

        Commons with David Jones MP because I replied on 22nd October 20093 to

        say that I had not previously been aware of his predicament and that I had

      been in contact with David Jones MP and would help in any way I could. It

      appears from my email that I did not remember the conversation I had

      previously had with CIIr John Kennett about Jo Hamilton but I cannot now say

      why that might have been.



9.    On 27th October 2009 Mr Bristow wrote to me4 to say that he had had another

      threatening letter from the Post Office, that he had found out that the problem

      arose from Horizon and that Brooks Newmark MP had asked a written question

      about Post Office miscarriages of justice.



10. It appears that I then wrote to David Jones MP and also raised the matter with

      CM. John Kennett, because by this time I had connected in my own mind Mr

      Bristow's case with that of Jo Hamilton. I wrote my first letter to Lord

      Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, on 3rd

      November 2009. In my email of 19th November 20095 I wrote to Mr Bristow to

      say that I had raised the issue with these people and that I was asking air

      Kennett's permission to pass on the contents of his email of 4th April 20096.



11. On 26th November 2009 I wrote to Mr Bristow, setting out the email dated 4th

      April 2009 that I had received from Cllr Kennett and asked Mr Bristow if he

      recognised any commonalities with his case.

12. On 29th November 2009 Mr Bristow wrote to me8 to say that there were indeed

      commonalities and to ask for a meeting. He drew my attention to another MP,

      David Heathcoat-Amory MP, who had had a constituent with a similar problem.



13. At some stage, and I do not remember the timing and I have no record in my

      diary of it, I also spoke to Nippy Singh, a Borough Councillor in my

      constituency, who was a senior figure in the National Federation of

      SubPostmasters, about the matter. His response was that the Horizon system

      worked well, and that the subpostmasters' problems were of their own making.



14. On 5th December 2009 Pat McFadden MP, Minister of State for Business,

      Innovation and Skills, replied9 to my letter of 3rd November 2009 saying that the

      Government had assumed an arms' length role in Post Office Ltd and that the

      issues I had raised were operational and contractual matters for POL and not

      for Government. This letter crossed in the post with my chasing letter of 10th

      December 200919.



15. While I was frustrated on receiving the Minister's letter, it did not then occur to

      me quite how troubling it was. In the years since then I have come to believe

      that in effect it left the British public with no redress against a Government-

      owned organisation which the Government was deliberately refusing to

      oversee. The only shareholder was repudiating the responsibilities of

      ownership. It may be that the Government considered such an arms' length

      relationship to be a necessary pre-cursor to the sale of Royal Mail or the Post

      Office to the private sector which, as I believe was widely thought at the time,

      the Government was hoping eventually to achieve. Or it may be that the

      Government considered that private sector disciplines would be easier to bring

      in to the Post Office if there were minimal Government interference in its day to

      day running. It might have been a mixture of both, but I do not know.



16. Also on 10th December 2009 there was a meeting between two or three Post

      Office personnel, David Jones MP and myself in a room off Westminster Hall in

      the House of Commons. I would expect the Post Office to have taken notes of

      that meeting. The briefing notes" written by James Marshall, my then Chief of

      Staff, in the diary entry say that we were to discuss general issues and the

      background. We were not to raise constituent-specific issues but it would be

      useful background for the meeting in my constituency with Mr Bristow that was

      to happen the following day. I could not stay for long, because I had a meeting

      at the same time of the Liaison Committee, but I remember that the Post Office

      personnel there were adamant that the Horizon system was "robust" (a word

      which struck me as unusual at the time, but one we have heard so many times

      since that it had clearly been fixed as the Post Office's line to take).



17. The following day, on 11th December 2009 I went to South Warnborough to

      meet David Bristow and Jo Hamilton as Mr Bristow had asked. Also present

      was Issy Hogg of Shoosmiths, the Basingstoke solicitors. I have not found a

      record of that meeting, but I came away thinking that the subpostmasters' case

                                         Page 9 of 193
                                                                                           WITN00020100




        was a convincing one. Both of them struck me as truthful people. I shall not

        repeat here Jo Hamilton's account of what had happened to her, but will only

        say that it has not changed in any respect since I first met her at that meeting in

        2009; I continue to keep in touch with her. I believed from what she told me

        that she probably had committed the offence of false accounting, but equally

        that she might have had no choice in the matter if she was (as she was

        contractually bound to do) to open the Post Office the following day. But even

        by then my legal experience (in chancery law rather than criminal law) was out

        of date, and I am no longer at all sure that she did, in fact and in all the

        circumstances, commit that offence. That, however, is not a matter for me to

        decide.



18. I think it is likely that at the meeting somebody showed me the article in

        Computer Weekly of 11th May 200912. For the reason set out above that

        strengthened in my eyes the credibility of the two subpostmasters and I

        distinctly remember that it and my meeting with the subpostmasters reduced

        the credence I would otherwise normally have given to the view of CIIr Nippy

        Singh, a man I respect. I should think that the meeting was the first time I had

        mentioned to me the name of Alan Bates, who formed the Justice for

        SubPostmasters Alliance that year.



19. On 15th December 2009 I sent David Jones MP a message13 to set up a

        meeting to see where we could take the matter. As I said in the message, I felt

         a campaign coming on. But nothing then appears to have come of that meeting

         or campaign. It may be (I cannot remember) that we could think of no way to

         take it further. Jo Hamilton had pleaded guilty, so could obviously not appeal.

         The Government was refusing to get involved. The Post Office was insistent

         that the Horizon system was "robust", and there was not sufficient evidence

         available to us to call that robustness into question.



20. However, I remained uncomfortable about the impasse we seemed to have

         reached. On 7th February 2011 there was aired on television a programme

         presented by Nick Wallis, Inside Out South14, which addressed the problem of

         the subpostmasters accused of fraud. Seema Misra, Jo Hamilton, David

         Bristow and I appeared on it. I said that there were a lot of cases that seemed

         to be cropping up all round the country and that I was very concerned about it.

         Amanda Glover of Shoosmiths, the solicitors, also appeared, and said that the

         55 people that had come forward to Shoosmiths were the tip of the iceberg.



21. On 9th February 2011 CIIr Nippy Singh telephoned me and asked me to set up

         an urgent meeting with Ed Davey MP, the Minister with responsibility for the

         Post Office. The issues on which Cllr Singh, who was expecting soon to

         become President of the NFSP, wanted to brief me to raise with the Minister did

         not include Horizon but were about the new Government proposals for the Post

         Office relating to Green Giros, Paypoint, and the structure of sub-post offices15.

         I believe that the meeting between Ed Davey MP and myself did take place,

      and I must have raised with him the issues of Horizon that I had raised in the

      Inside Out South interview two days earlier, because it was not the sort of thing

      I would have passed over; I subsequently referred to such a discussion in a

      letter I wrote to Ed Davey on 15th December 201116.



22. On 16th February 2011 I wrote to Amanda Glover17 at Shoosmiths to say that I

      would be grateful if she would update Janet Walker, who worked in my office,

      about the subpostmaster matter. I am sure she did so.



23. At some stage during 2011, probably at a defence conference at Ditchley Park

      of 22nd and 23rd September 2011, I had a conversation with Alice Perkins. I

      knew her because she had been a senior and respected civil servant,

      seconded by the Treasury to the Ministry of Defence, at a time between 1995

      and 1997 when I had been Minister of State for Defence Procurement. I

      discovered during that conversation that she might soon be involved with the

      Post Office, and I raised with her my concerns about the events described

      above. She expressed a wish to help sort it out but was not at that stage in a

      position to do so.



24. In December 2011 the event that really exacerbated my concerns took place:

      Mr Bristow having been removed as subpostmaster from the Odiham Post

      Office, his successor, Mr Paul Kemp, was also removed and the Odiham Post

      Office was closed. Some of my Odiham constituents (though not Mr Kemp)

      wrote to me to express their concern about the closure of the Post Office on the

      grounds, my constituents said, of "irregularities".



25. I immediately took the view that this could not be a coincidence. It confirmed to

      me that what Shoosmiths had been saying about their cases being

      representative of a widespread problem required serious investigation.



26. On 151h December 2011 I wrote to Ms Moya Greene18, the then Chief Executive

      of Royal Mail, and to the Minister, Ed Davey MP19, to express my concerns that

      there were apparently 34 cases of such unexplained problems and I asked for

      the matter to be looked into as a matter of urgency. I told Ms Greene and the

      Minister that I was planning on meeting the 34 individuals to discuss what

      action they planned on taking.



27. At some stage I suggested to Shoosmiths that I should write to all MPs to ask if

      they had experienced similar issues, and that then the MPs and Shoosmiths,

      possibly with subpostmasters as well, should meet in the House of Commons

      to discuss possible ways forward. On 3rd January 2012 my new Chief of Staff,

      Janet Walker, wrote to ask Shoosmiths about a date of such a meeting, which

      would probably be around the end of February 2012. On 11th January 2012

      Mr Channer of Shoosmiths replied to say he was keen to have such a meeting.

28. I have seen two replies from the Post Office to my letter to them, one or both of

      which I probably received. Paula Vennells, then Managing Director of POL,

      wrote an unsigned letter of 9th January 201220, referring to the JFSA and

      allegations about financial discrepancies being due in some way to the system;

      she said there was no evidence to support those allegations and she was

      confident that the system was robust (that word again) and fit for purpose. The

      other was written on behalf of Moya Greene by Kevin Gilliland, Network and

      Sales Director, who wrote an unsigned letter of 12th January 201221 in similar

      terms but not referring to the JFSA, saying that POL did not accept the

      allegations and that they were fully confident in the integrity and robustness of

      the system. I do not remember receiving a reply from the Minister. I drafted a

      template reply22 to send to my constituents saying that I was suspicious of what

      the Post Office said about the software it was using.



29. At this stage I did not know the truth of the matter but it was clear that a

      detailed investigation was needed. I thought it was conceivable but unlikely

      that all of these allegations were wrong — there were too many for it to be a

      coincidence, and by this time I had come across three in my own constituency.

      (From my vague memory I later came across a fourth.) The subpostmasters I

      had met seemed to me to be transparently honest. I do not remember anyone

      suggesting to me that the introduction of a new computerised accounting

      system had uncovered previously hidden fraudsters. If they did I would have

      given it little credence, both because of the self-evident honesty of the

subpostmasters I had met and because of the sudden rash of similar

allegations appearing shortly after the installation of a new computer system,

an exercise which inevitably will have teething problems. I was therefore not

satisfied with the brush off I was getting by way of reply to my letters of 151

December 2011.

THE APPOINTMENT OF SECOND SIGHT



30. On 12th January 2012 Janet Walker wrote to Mr Channer to suggest the

      meeting take place on 20th or 27th February 2012, and on 17th January 2012 Mr

      Channer replied to choose 27th February 2012. On or about 31st January 2012

      Janet Walker wrote to Mr Channer23 to say:



               "I would like to pencil in a pre-meeting meeting with James, here at

               Westminster, on 20 February at 11am. This will be to go over what

               Shoosmiths are doing with regard to the post office cases. James will

               be interested to learn what it is you think MPs can do to help. You will

               know that once solicitors are involved, unless they expressly give

               permission to MPs to become involved in their constituent's case, and

               have a role to play in helping, MPs must stand aside. This is one

               reason both meetings are important.



               The larger meeting on 27 February at 2pm is for Shoosmiths,

               interested individuals affected by this matter, and constituency MPs, to

               discuss what is happening. In order to entice MPs along, it is important

               for the individuals you have listed on your spreadsheet to write to their

               MPs, giving details about the meeting, stating that they (the individual)

               will attend and asking their MP to do so as well. Could you possibly let

                me have a draft of this proposed letter, as I would like to use some of

                your wording in an email invitation we will send to MPs, which will

                come from James."



31. After the pre-meeting, on 22nd February 2012, I telephoned a friend of mine,

      Orna Ni Chionna, who was on the board of the Post Office/Royal Mail. She

      said that her responsibilities were limited to Royal Mail, but that she suggested I

      write to the incoming chair of the Post Office, Alice Perkins, whom, as set out

      above, I had met at Ditchley Park



32. I wrote to Alice Perkins on 23rd February 201224, saying:



                "You may remember that when we last met at, I think, Ditchley Park I

                mentioned the issue of the Horizon computer system in use in Sub

                Post Offices throughout the country, and said I had a real concern

                about the way some of the sub-Post Masters in and outside my

                constituency had been treated. I have spoken to Orna Ni Chionna as

                well about this, and she may mention it to you.



                "May I please come and see you about it? I know it is the position of

                the Post Office (supported by the National Federation of Sub Post

                Masters, though not by the Communications Workers Union) that there

                is nothing wrong with Horizon. I am deeply sceptical about this, and

                hope I can persuade you to look afresh at the matter, rather than

                accepting that there should be a closing of ranks round the computer.



                "I look forward to hearing from you."




33. Alice Perkins replied the same day25, offering a meeting either at the House of

      Commons or the Post Office.



34. At some stage, perhaps as a result of the premeeting with Mr Channer on 20th

      February 2012, perhaps in preparation for the substantive meeting with the

      subpostmasters on 27th February 2012, somebody, and I think it was probably

      Mr Channer rather than Janet Walker, prepared a two page summary26 of the

      issues. The points made included:



                "Access Legal from Shoosmiths, a national law firm, have been

                contacted by almost 100 SPM's who have suffered losses they cannot

                explain, and have been subjected to disciplinary measures by POL. All

                are adamant that they or their staff have not stolen any money."



                "They claim there has been no real investigation by POL as to the

                cause of the losses that have appeared — and SPMs are expected to

                pay it back regardless of how it was caused."

35. Many of the issues raised in the summary of the issues were later to be found

      by Mr Justice Fraser to have occurred.



36. On 24th February 2012 I emailed Alice Perkins to ask her to come to meet me,

      and said that my office would arrange it.



37. On 27th February 2012 between 2:00 and 3:00pm the meeting between the

      subpostmasters, Shoosmiths and MPs took place in the Wilson Room of

      Portcullis House of the House of Commons. Janet Walker took notes of the

      meeting27 which refer to the summary of issues. It was attended by six

      Members of Parliament including myself and by the representatives of two

      others, by Tadge Channer and Rose Donoghue from Shoosmiths and also by

      some subpostmasters and some of their partners (the spreadsheet28 provided

      by Shoosmiths beforehand suggested that 23 subpostmasters attended).



38. I chaired the meeting and told the subpostmasters that I did not believe that

      they were anything other than honest, and that the allegations about the Post

      Office gave rise to a series of concerns. Mr Channer said that just under 100

      individuals had come to Shoosmiths with similar cases. Rose Donaghue said

      that the Post Office had a moral if not legal obligation to sort the matter out.

      Andrew Tyrie MP recommended commissioning a report to look into the matter.

      Mr Channer said that there would be two problems with that, the first being the

      cost and the second access to the Horizon system. I told the meeting that I

      was organising a meeting with the Chairman Designate of the Post Office, Alice

      Perkins. I asked everyone present to get more people who were in the same

      situation to write to their MPs to ask them to contact me. I said (and believed)

      that the Post Office's line, which was always that there was nothing wrong with

      Horizon, was wholly implausible, because so many people would not have

      come to the House of Commons simply to say that they were not criminals, that

      those attending were there to ensure something was done to prove that they

      were not, and that loss of reputation was a very hurtful thing.



39. On 13th March 2012 there took place in my office in the House of Commons a

      meeting between Alice Perkins and Alwen Lyons of the Post Office and myself;

      this had been arranged following my writing to Alice Perkins on 23rd February

      2012. According to the Post Office minutes29 of that meeting it seems that I

      was the only MP present. While it seems likely that Janet Walker would have

      been there taking notes, I cannot find a record of it. I accept the truth of the

      Post Office minutes, presumably taken by Alwen Lyons. In the meeting I raised

      concerns about the training of the subpostmasters, about the support and

      helpline and about the contract between the subpostmasters and the Post

      Office. Alice Perkins invited me to see Horizon in action, and I suggested that I

      should be accompanied by a computer expert from Computer Weekly. I

      explained my belief in Computer Weekly arising out of the Chinook crash

      referred to above.

40. I wrote to Alice Perkins on 26th March 20123° to thank her for coming to the

      meeting but also to thank her for lending a willing ear. It was my belief then,

      and it remains my belief now, that at that stage at any rate she genuinely did

      wish to sort the matter out.



41. On 28th March 2012 Oliver Letwin MP wrote to Janet Walker arranging to meet

      me on 16th April 2012 (after the Easter Recess) to talk about Post Office issues.



42. In a letter of 2nd April 201231 Alice Perkins invited me to visit the Post Office

      HQ. Our respective offices agreed that this meeting should take place on 171h

      May 2012. Oliver Letwin and I met on 16th April 2012, which presumably led to

      my inviting him to the meeting at the Post Office.



43. On 17th May 2012 from 10:30 to 12:00 a meeting took place between Alice

      Perkins and Paula Vennells of Post Office Ltd and Oliver Letwin and myself at

      1st floor, 148 Old Street, London EC1V 9HQ. I have seen the Post Office

      pack32 dealing with the meeting and I have no reason to question it. My own

      memory of the meeting is that Alice Perkins and Paula Vennells were clear that

      they believed their systems worked well, but they were equally clear that they

      too wanted to clear up a matter that was growing in importance for them, and

      they both wanted and needed to find a way through that would solve the

      problem to the satisfaction of everyone. I believed then and I believe now that

      they did both genuinely want and expect to sort the matter out and that their

      belief in the integrity of Horizon was real.



44. It may or may not be relevant, but Alice Perkins particularly made the point that

      when as Chair designate she began her introductory visits to sub-Post Offices,

      she was struck by — or there was brought to her attention - the huge amounts of

      cash that were lying around in unexpected places, and she said the Post Office

      and the subpostmasters needed to have efficient ways of accounting for and

      dealing with that cash. I believe that she or Paula Vennells or both mentioned

      the temptation that this put in the way of subpostmasters. I do not know

      whether that point — which Alice Perkins made strongly — affected her approach

      towards the honesty or otherwise of subpostmasters.



45. Towards the end of the meeting Paula Vennells said that the Post Office

      believed that what we (and the Post Office) needed, to get to the bottom of the

      allegations being made by the subpostmasters, was an investigation by

      forensic accountants, to be paid for by the Post Office. This amounted to an

      offer by the Post Office to provide exactly what had been suggested by Andrew

      Tyrie MP in the meeting of 27th February 2012, but overcoming the two

      objections of cost and access to the Horizon system that had been raised by Mr

      Channer33. Oliver Letwin and I accepted with enthusiasm and relief. I believe

      we pointed out at that stage the suspicion that some MPs would have about the

      independence of any such investigation being funded by the Post Office, and

      either Alice Perkins or Paula Vennells or both agreed that the MPs should meet

      the accountants to be recommended by the Post Office, to satisfy ourselves

      that they would indeed be independent.



46. Oliver Letwin and I came away from the meeting feeling that it had gone better

      than we had hoped. We were content that things were on the right track.



47. It seems that one of the matters that must have been agreed at the meeting on

      17th May 2012 was that Alice Perkins and Paula Vennells would come to a

      meeting of MPs in the House of Commons to lay before the MPs the agreement

      we had reached. On or about 26th May 2012 inter-office negotiations on the

      date of that meeting with MPs concluded that it would take place at 6pm on

      Tuesday 18th June 2012 in Portcullis House with, attending from the Post

      Office, Alice Perkins (Chairman), Paula Vennells (Chief Executive), Angela Van

      Den Bogerd (Head of Network Services) and Alwen Lyons (Company

      Secretary).



48. A list dated 28th May 201234 entitled "List of MPs who have a constituent

      affected by the Horizon/Post Office case" drawn up by Janet Walker suggests

      that at that stage she was aware of 38 MPs including myself who had

      constituents affected.



49. On 8th June 201235 Janet Walker emailed Glenda at the Post Office to suggest

      a short 15 minute premeeting to take place between the Post Office personnel

      and myself before the full meeting with MPs on 18th June 2012. It appears that

      on 11th June 2012 there was a telephone call36 between Paula Vennells and

      myself to discuss and agree an agenda (which appears to have been drafted by

      the Post Office) for the meeting to take place on 18th June 2012. It may be that

      it was in this conversation that she told me about Second Sight. At some stage

      I believe she told me that Susan Crichton, Post Office's General Counsel, had

      worked with Second Sight before and had been impressed by them. And at

      some stage Paula Vennells told me that she would send me the proposed

      Terms of Reference for their appointment.



50. On 12th or 13th June 2012 I wrote37 to Alice Perkins and Paula Vennells to

      thank them for sending me the proposed Terms of Reference38. Those terms

      included:



                "Reviewing all company-held documentation focussing on why

                shortfalls occurred.

                Interviewing company investigators to gain insights and to verify their

                findings,

                Reviewing defence submissions and

                Studying relevant evidence with regard to the 'Horizon' system."

51.   The review would "reach conclusions on each case and identify any systemic

      issues/concerns, including training and support processes."



52. In my email I also made the points, first, that the subpostmasters should also

      be present at the meetings with MPs and, second, that the coming summer

      recess would cause difficulties with timing. I attached a draft Press release of

      which I do not have a copy.



53. On 13th June 2012 Paula Vennells wrote to me39 to advise against the press

      release and to set out her approach. She said,



               "Dear James, thank you for your care and attention to this. It is critical

               we resolve it properly and I am grateful to you.



               "Firstly, let me reassure you that Altice [sic] and I intend total

               transparency - as I'm sure you sensed from the meeting we arranged

               for you and Oliver.



               "Secondly, the queries you raise are entirely valid: the reason I had

               wanted to meet face to face on Monday was to talk this through. Each

               case as you saw with your own and with Oliver's, is different. We are

               dealing with particularly sensitive and personal situations, as well as

               with a combination of fact and misunderstandings. (And in some cases,

               as we explained, fiction and /or fraud.)

             "Rather than a blanket approach, we would take each case separately -

             we are dealing with individuals' lives and livelihoods. But, the guarantee

             for each one is complete transparency and handled in the most

             appropriate and sensitive way. Therefore in some, we may need to go

             further than the draft TOR suggests, with SubPostmasters in joint

             meetings; in others, that might be difficult and/or embarrassing for them

             and their MPs. We would however, start with each MP in order to

             explain/explore the background.



             "Thank you for reminding me about summer Recess - of course, we will

             work to a timetable that suits.



             "As regards, your draft release, my view is that it would not be without

             risk both in terms of human sensitivities and reputational distortions.

             There are reasons for this which I am happy to share."



             And she added, "Ps. Alice is away on holiday this week, hence I am

             replying for both of us. (We discussed the issue of transparency before

             she left. As you would expect, Alice is committed to the primacy of this.

             She is also very aware of the risks and sensitivities of how we handle

             the individual cases.)"



54. It appears that the premeeting in fact took place on 14th June 2012 between

     Paula Vennells and Alwen Lyons and myself. It is possible that Oliver Letwin

      MP also attended. I cannot remember what was said or done at that

      premeeting.



55. The meeting with MPs took place on 18th June 2012, with six MPs Including

      myself) attending and representatives of three more, as well as the

      representatives from the Post Office. Janet Walker took notes4° which reflected

      the discussion. I concluded the meeting by saying that the terms of reference

      would be circulated, the investigations begun shortly and concluded by the end

      of the year. A draft press release was agreed.



56. On the following day, 19th June 2012, I said in an email to Shoosmiths41 that we

      had had the meeting with the Post Office and that we had found a very positive

      way to resolve the problem. It seems that Janet Walker in my office sent the

      Post Office a copy of the email. I also issued a press release42 on 19th June

      2012 which is entitled "Resolution to Post Office/Horizon system problems

      proposed".



57. On 22nd June 2012 Christopher Hine of RSM Tenon wrote to me, perhaps

      following up an email from one of his colleagues, Paul Burchett, to offer his

      firm's services as the forensic accountants who would investigate Horizon. It

      seems likely that RSM Tenon had previously advised a subpostmaster,

      because I replied to him43 on 28th June 2012 to say,

                "whoever takes on the investigations into each case must be genuinely

                independent. The Post Office is insisting on this as well, therefore we

                have decided that anyone with prior connection to the cases involved

                really cannot take part.'



        He responded on 4th July 201244 accepting the need for independence.



58. The next task was for the MPs to interview Second Sight. It had been agreed

      on all sides at the MPs' meeting that such an appointment would work only if

      the MPs who were concerned could vet them before they were appointed; there

      was a natural suspicion that accountants chosen and paid for by the Post Office

      would have their tune called by the Post Office rather than by the interests of

      justice. On 26th June 2012 Janet Walker telephoned Ron Warmington of

      Second Sight and agreed a meeting date of 4th July 2012. Second Sight sent

      their biographical details45. The meeting took place, with Andrew Bridgen MP,

      Mary Glindon MP, Tessa Munt MP and Mike Wood MP, with Edward Garnier MP

      sending a representative. Janet Walker, having put forward a list of suggested

      questions46 for MPs to ask Second Sight, took notes47. Those notes are similar

      in content to those in Ron Warmington's email" to Susan Crichton of 4th July

      2012. The MPs were convinced of Second Sight's expertise and determination

      to be independent, and endorsed the appointment of Second Sight, but also

      wanted the agreement (without giving him a veto) of Alan Bates, who was a

      person of increasing importance and influence in the representation of

      sub postmasters.



59. Shortly after the meeting with Second Sight, and probably the same day and as

      a consequence, I telephoned Alan Bates of the Justice For Subpostmasters

      Alliance, because at some stage, according to his email of 5th July 201249, I

      suggested that he and I needed to meet Second Sight. He told Janet Walker

      he would be bringing Kay Linnell as the JFSA's expert forensic accountant.



60. Alwen Lyons asked Janet Walker how we thought the meeting with Second

      Sight had gone, and in my email of 5th July 20125° I confirmed that it had gone

      well.



61. The meeting between Alan Bates, Kay Linnell, Ron Warmington, Ian

      Henderson and myself took place on 12th July 2012 in my office in Portcullis

      House. Kay Linnell was particularly challenging of Second Sight, but the

      overall result was that Alan and Kay too, with a caveat, agreed with the

      appointment of Second Sight. The caveat was that they wanted to enable Kay

      Linnell, at the Post Office's expense, to double check that Second Sight were

      doing a proper independent job. After the meeting I wrote an email51 to Alwen

      Lyons asking the Post Office to set aside £5000 towards Kay Linnell's doing a

      review of Second Sight's initial investigations.

62. On 13th July 2012 Alan Bates wrote to me52 to set out his understanding of what

      we had agreed as the way forward even though, he said, I had not at the end of

      the meeting sought his agreement. He said that the scope of the initial

      investigation would include, but would not be restricted to:



                "1. Review of area manager complaints.

                2. A description of the Horizon system operations, in theory, in practice

                including training and level and access and authority.

                3. Review of the second level queries of system problems especially

                those involving Fujitsu.

                4. Preparation of a forensic analysis of the system errors to be used in

                point 5.

                5. Selection of a sample of cases together with the historic cases put

                forward by MPs.

                6. Live data testing on system parameters.

                7. Report on the "cradle to grave" of the transactions that are flagged

                up in the cases reviewed.

                8. Report on the integrity of the Post Office Horizon system."



        If the terms set out in his letter were agreed then he would, on behalf of the

        members of JFSA, be prepared to offer his full support and cooperation with

        the investigation, as proposed.

63. On 16th July 2012 Mia Porter on behalf of Paula Vennells emailed me53 to

      agree the proposal for setting aside £5,000, which was later confirmed in a

      letter to me from Alwen Lyons of 28th August 201254.



64. On 17th July 2012 I emailed Paula Vennells55 to ask what to do with cases

      forwarded to me by MPs, and she replied that I should send them on to the

      office of the Company Secretary, Alwen Lyons. It appears from an email sent

      on 18th July 2012 from Alwen Lyons to Paula Vennells that a slightly different

      arrangement was going to happen with Alan Bates and the JFSA, in that Alan

      Bates was going to forward cases to Second Sight. In any event, things were

      underway.



65. I replied to Alan Bates's letter on 18th July 2012; in my files I have two different

      drafts of that reply56, one containing an apology for my apparent failure to ask

      for his explicit agreement, but both setting out the way forward that we

      envisaged, with Second Sight doing their initial investigations, the result of

      which would determine the later ones, including whether an investigation was

      needed of the entire system.



66. I received a letter dated 6th August 201257 from Mr Hogan of Messrs Hogan

       THE INTERIM REPORT AND THE MEDIATION SCHEME



67. On 31st August 2012 Alan Bates sent an email to Janet Walker in my office

      expressing concerns about several matters. I do not have a copy of that email

      but the tenor of what he said can be gleaned from my draft reply of 3rd

      September 201258, which I expect I sent in the words drafted and which it is

      worth setting out in full:



               "Thank you for your email to Janet Walker of 31 August 2012, bringing

               me up to date with your concerns about this matter. Please be assured

               that I am well aware of the difficulty individual SubPostmasters and

               mistresses have had, and continue to have, with regard to this entire

               matter. Do not underestimate my determination to see that they are

               dealt with fairly.



               "I am slightly at a loss as to your message, however, as I did not think

               that you believed investigations ought not to proceed until we had your

               agreement. Investigations are indeed already underway. 2nd Sight

               have a number of these that have been passed from individuals to their

               MPs, and thence to my office. In every case, my office has ensured

               that the individual concerned, as well as his or her MP, is fully aware

               that his or her details will be passed to the Post Office, who require this

               detail in order to pass on relevant data to 2nd Sight in order for them to

               conduct their investigation. We will continue to proceed along these

lines with any individual SubPostmaster or mistress that approaches us

via their MP.



"I understand that you have been sent a copy of the letter the Post

Office sent to me, confirming that they have set aside £5000 for the

review of 2nd Sight's initial investigations, which we discussed at our

last meeting. Do you agree that this should be done by Miss Kay

Linnell.



"The Post Office has, in addition, drafted a form of words which I

understand you have also seen, but not commented on, as follows, and

I draw your attention in particular to paragraphs 2 and 3, and ask that

you might let me have your thoughts on their points. They seem to me

to be reasonable:



       "Post Office Limited ("POL") has agreed that the Office of the Rt

       Hon James Arbuthnot should contact Alan Bates and the Justice

       for Sub Postmasters Alliance ("JFSA") and request that the

       JFSA submit approximately 5 of their best cases for independent

       review by Second Sight Support Services Ltd ("2nd Sight").

       Ideally, cases for review should be less than 5 years old, but it

       may be possible to accept older cases in certain circumstances.

       2nd Sight is the body appointed by POL to conduct an

       independent review of a number of cases that have previously

       been subject to formal investigation by POL.

                                                                 WITN00020100




"POL recognises that the JFSA may have concerns about

submitting detailed information about possible cases to POL and

agrees that the JFSA may submit this information directly to 2nd

Sight, via the Office of the Rt Hon James Arbuthnot. JFSA must

recognise that minimum basic information about each case such

as branch details, identity of the sub-postmaster and relevant

dates must be notified to POL by 2nd Sight in order that the

appropriate records and correspondence may be provided to

2nd Sight.



"POL also recognises that some members of JFSA may have

concerns about submitting cases for independent review by 2nd

Sight where even basic case information is communicated to

POL. Whilst POL cannot provide any form of immunity from

prosecution in respect of information held by POL, in recognition

of the concerns expressed by the JSFA, POL agrees not to take

any prosecution action relating to information provided by JFSA

without the agreement of the Executive Committee of POL and

to deal which each case submitted in a sensitive manner. The

Executive Committee of POL comprises 9 senior members of

staff including the POL Chief Executive and the POL Lead

Counsel.

                "Finally, I do not think it is wise or indeed feasible to dictate to 2nd

                Sight how their conduct their investigations. Neither you nor I are

                experts in this field. They are, and Miss Linnell is being offered the

                opportunity to bring her expertise to bear in her review. I do not think

                we can do more than this and would suggest we left those with the

                requisite skills to do their job independently. They outlined how they

                would conduct their investigation when we met, and Miss Linnet/ was

                content, as was I, and as I thought were you. I had no expectation that

                anyone anticipated signing an agreement to this effect.



                "I think you and I, and the Post Office as well, want the right result from

                this undertaking — a fair and independent examination of a number of

                cases, from which results can be extrapolated to see what next steps

                may be required. It would be a shame if you felt unable to lend this

                your support, as I believe it is the best chance the Alliance is going to

                be offered to help your membership get the justice they seek. I hope

                you might give this some thought."



68. Alan Bates replied on 6th September 201259 to point out that in my letter to him

      of 18th July 2012 I had said,



                "Your point about obtaining cases where current errors are occurring

                was and is a very good one. I shall write to the Post Office and suggest

                                          Page 36 of 193

                this, asking firstly that individuals might be prompted to come forward

                via the Post Office's Subspace magazine, and secondly, for some

                assurances with regard to immunity. I take your point that this immunity

                ought to be extended to all personnel involved. Thank you for making

                it."



69. It had clearly slipped through the net, and on 13th September 2012 I wrote to

      Paula Vennells6° enclosing Alan Bates's letter and asking her to address the

      points about immunity and mentioning the investigation in the Post Office's

      Subspace magazine.



70. On 18th September 2012 there was a catch-up meeting between Alice Perkins

      and myself. The negotiations to set this up had been going on since the end of

      July 2012, and it seems likely that amongst the matters we discussed were the

      points raised in Alan Bates's correspondence.



71. On 4th October 2012 there was a meeting between Alan Bates, Paula Vennells,

      her Chief of Staff and myself. It seems from a letter61 I wrote to Alan Bates

      after that meeting that the main purpose of the meeting was to put him together

      with Paula Vennells so that they could deal directly with each other, rather than

      through me. But from that letter, and from a letter I also wrote to Paula

      Vennells on the same day62, it is clear that I at any rate thought the meeting

      had gone well (to Alan Bates, I said, "very well indeed" and to Paula Vennells I

      said, "I was extremely pleased"). I would have expected Janet Walker also to

      have been present at that meeting, but I cannot find any evidence that she was

      or that she took notes.



72. I received a letter of 5th October 2012 from Albert Owen MP about one of his

      constituents, to which I replied on 231d October 201263. From my reply can be

      seen the view that I then had about the entire negotiations with the Post Office.

     I said:



               "Thank you for your letter of 5 October, and I am sorry it has taken me

               a while to respond. This is with regard to your constituent, [   ], about

               the Horizon system and the issue to do with SubPostmasters.



               "I recently hosted a meeting between Mr Alan Bates, who chairs the

               Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, and the Chief Executive of the

               Post Office, Paula Vennells, and her chief of staff. It appears that there

               has been some disconnect between the two parties as to the exact

               terms of investigations that will be brought to the forensic accountants

               directly from the JSFA. This has to do with a blanket guarantee of

               immunity, which the Post Office as a statutory body cannot offer, and

               the currency of cases that ought to be investigated. The result of this

               meeting is that the two parties are going to talk directly and come to an

               agreement, rather than having to deal with each other via my office.

               "I ought to let you know that I continue to pass on details - at the

               request of their constituency MP - of individuals who are happy for me

               to do so, to the forensic accountants. There are just over a dozen who

               have done so thus far in the full knowledge that their details will be

               passed first of all to the Post Office who are collating relevant data,

               who then pass details and data on to the accountants. No offer of

               immunity has been made to these people, and so if your constituent is

               concerned about this, he ought to stay in touch with the JSFA and

               await their negotiations with the Post Office before deciding whether or

               not to proceed. The JSFA will be best placed to advise him about this.



               "Finally, I should like to add that there is nothing sinister about the

               investigations that are underway. My constituent, clearly those others

               who have been content for their details to be made known, the Post

               Office, and I are all extremely keen for this entire matter to be resolved.

               What I expect is that, beyond the results of individual investigations,

               the accountants will be able to extrapolate some general points from

               the investigations undertaken, which will point the way for further work

               to be done. I am awaiting the results with real interest.



               "Do come back to me if you need more detail as I am happy to help."



73. I received a letter dated 23rd November 201264 from John Woodcock MP about

      one of his constituents, from which it appeared that the Post Office was

        redirecting complaints about the Horizon system to me, so that I could vet

        whether the case should then be included in the tranche of cases being

        investigated by Second Sight. John Woodcock understandably found this

        strange and had written to the Minister, Jo Swinson MP. In my lengthy reply of

        4th December 201265 I set out the history of the matter.



74. I received a similar request from Damian Hinds MP dated 16th January 2013 in

        relation to a constituent of his, and another from Sir Alan Meale MP in relation

        to two of his constituents. I should think I or my office probably replied to them

        in similar terms to the way I had replied to John Woodcock MP.



75. On 19th February 2013 Janet Walker emailed Ron Warmington and Ian

        Henderson, starting her email66 with,



              "I am so relieved to hear that things are beginning to run smoothly. Well

             done! It really is your persistence and patience that has driven this, and

             James will be really pleased."



          She also passed on details of two further MPs, Mark Lazarowicz MP and Priti

          Patel MP, who had constituents who had cases which needed investigation.

          But it seems that I had also begun to receive questions from MPs about

          Second Sight's methodology and how they were getting along, so Janet asked

          if Second Sight could contact the MPs and let them know.

76. Ian Henderson told Janet Walker in his first email67 the following day, 20th

      February 2013, that they were moving towards thematic issues rather than

      case by case investigations. Janet Walker replied68 that she would need to

      discuss that with me, and in his second email69 he said that their current

      thinking was that they would issue a single report that dealt with all the thematic

      issues that were identified, but that in addition, each sub-postmaster and MP

      would be issued with an appendix dealing with the specific issues they had

      raised.



77. A telephone call was set up for Thursday 28th February 2013 between Ian

      Henderson and myself and Janet Walker to discuss how in practice to deal with

      the queries I would receive from MPs, and to set up a meeting on 25th March

      2013 between Second Sight, the Post Office and MPs.



78. On 7th March 20137° I wrote an email to MP colleagues to invite them to the

      meeting to take place on 25th March 2013 and I also wrote to Alan Bates to

      suggest that Second Sight were keen on Post Office representatives being at

      the meeting and wondering whether he would be content with this. Rather

      oddly I also (without waiting for a response from Alan Bates) wrote to Alice

      Perkins71 to invite her to the meeting. I made to her various points about how

      the meeting might go, including the following:



67 [JARB0000040].
68 [JARB0000041].
69 [JARB0000042].

7° [JARB0000043].

                "In my discussions with Ron and Ian, I gather that questions have been

                raised over the absolute integrity of Horizon, though without their being

                so fundamental as to say that the system is not fit for purpose. Since it

                is a system that remains in current use, there is the risk that existing

                SubPostmasters and mistresses may find themselves in exactly the

                same position as those whose cases are being investigated. I know

                that definitive results are not yet available, but I hope the Post Office

                would be ready to address this issue."



79. I concluded the letter as follows:



                "I would like to say in conclusion that I am impressed beyond my

                expectations with not only how the investigations are proceeding, but of

                your continuing support. I cannot recall a more important campaign,

                nor one where the end result has been so consistently supported by all

                parties involved. You have my gratitude and admiration for how the

                Post Office is handling this."




80. My letter caused strong push back from the Post Office, and on 19th March

      2013 there was a meeting between myself and Alice Perkins. It appears from a

      speaking note72 Janet Walker wrote for me for a telephone call on 20th March

      2013 between myself and Ian Henderson that at the meeting on 19th March



72 [JARB0000045].

     2013 Alice Perkins said amongst other things: that the Post Office didn't believe

     anything was wrong with Horizon; that they were very concerned that any

     opinion being formed by Second Sight at this stage was being communicated;

     that Second Sight should not be expressing an opinion, not least as PO hadn't

     had right of reply; that there was a limit to the Post Office's willingness to

     continue funding investigations; that it seemed there would be some sort of

     deadline for cases of the end of February (though it is unclear from the note

     what this meant); and that the Post Office would not attend the meeting of 25th

     March 2013 but there would be an open letter from the Post Office available for

     distribution at that meeting; and that the Post Office would expect to be ready to

     attend a meeting with MPs in perhaps June.



81. It appears from that speaking note that after the meeting on 19th March 2013

     Ian Henderson had his own meeting with the Post Office, probably Susan

     Crichton, General Counsel (though the note refers to Susan Leyton(?), head of

     legal), and Alwen Lyons, company secretary.



82. On 20th March 2013 Ian Henderson and I and probably Janet Walker and

     possibly other MPs had the telephone call. Apart from the fact that I believe I

     would have passed on what Alice Perkins had said the day before, I cannot

     remember exactly what was said in that telephone call. Looking back on it now,

     it may have been the first time that Second Sight had said that there might be

     issues with Horizon, and the first time that the Post Office had tried to restrict

     things that could be said openly by Second Sight about Horizon.

83. On 25th March 2013 there was a meeting in Room N of Portcullis House for

      Second Sight to update the MPs. I had an agenda which was:



                "17:00 Welcome — James Arbuthnot

                17.05        Second Sight — lan Henderson, Ron Warmington

                Update on investigations — process followed, rationale for procedure,

                preliminary findings

                17.35        MPs Q&A

                18.0    Close"



84. For the meeting, attended by 11 MPs, Second Sight, JFSA and Shoosmiths,

      Janet Walker had done me speaking notes73. I thanked Alice Perkins and the

      Post Office, Shoosmiths, JFSA, Kay Linnell and Second Sight. I made the

      point that the Post Office were saying that it had not been given the opportunity

      to comment on what had been found thus far, thus we should not pre-judge

      matters before this had occurred and that it would not be helpful to issue press

      releases now, but this time would come. I then turned over to Second Sight.

      Ian Henderson had provided me with a draft74 of what he was going to say.

      Janet Walker kept a note of the meeting75 which so far as I recall accurately

      reflected what was said.



85. Alan Bates sent me a long letter dated 1st April 201376. After reflecting on the

      meeting with Second Sight he expressed his frustration that there seemed to be

      less appetite than he would have liked for the Post Office to be confronted with

      Horizon's systemic failures (of which Second Sight appeared to be finding

      some evidence), their bullying and abusive use of their powers that he and

      JFSA had been talking about for years. I was on holiday when the letter came

      in, and I replied on 16th April 201377 saying I would raise the matters with

      Second Sight.



86. It appears (from an email78 of "High" importance that Janet Walker wrote to

      Second Sight on 9th May 2013) that we were chasing them and the Post Office

      for their comments on Alan Bates's letter, which it seems I had sent to Second

      Sight on 16th April 2013.



87. On 23rd May 2013 there was a telephone call between myself and Paula

      Vennells. Janet Walker prepared speaking notes79 for that conversation. In

      those speaking notes I see the first reference in my files to the Rudkin events at

      Bracknell, because it would appear that Ron Warmington had emailed Alan

      Bates to say:



                `You have mentioned "numerous miscarriages ofjustice" and it's pretty

                clear that James has also focussed on that.... as has POL's top

                management. You, Kay, Ian and I all know how much reliance has

                been placed by the courts (Criminal and Civil) on POL's assurances

                (such as that "there is no remote access to the system or to individual

               branch terminals which would allow accounting records to be

               manipulated in any way'). As you also know, Alan, several of the Spot

               Reviews have presented what appears to be evidence that completely

               undermines and disproves statements like that. I am pretty certain

               that, in the event that even one of those Spot Reviews (for example

               SR005 the Bracknell Basement/Rudkin one) turns out to be irrefutable,

               then James will completely understand the implications, as I'm sure will

               POL's senior management.'



       I believe the conversation went much as Janet Walker's speaking notes

       suggested it should.




88. I cannot remember exactly when Ron Warmington and I discussed the rumours

      about the Michael Rudkin visit to Fujitsu but he told me that Second Sight could

      not put anything in their Interim Report about it until they had discovered what

      had actually happened. He and I agreed that it was at best odd, and potentially

      sinister, that Michael Rudkin's account of his visit to Fujitsu was being flatly

      denied by the Post Office on the basis that it never took place.



89. It seems from an email of 11th June 201380 from Alan Bates to Janet Walker

      that I had just sent him a letter or email in which I asked for a chat with him. At

      the same time I probably emailed Ron Warmington, probably to ask for an

      update and to propose a meeting with MPs before the summer recess. Ron

      Warmington responded to my email in one of his own in the early hours of 12th

      June 201381, in which he said:



                "171 send a proper response to your latest email later today but the idea

                of a 2nd July meeting is certainly a good one so well agree to that.

                Also, I don't think we'll need your help in getting POL to respond to the

                Spot Reviews. They are RESPONDING... but not yet in a form that will

                really WORK in our Interim Report or in the 8th July Meeting. They are

                still - understandably I suppose - incredibly defensive and nobody - at

                the levels producing the responses - is ready to give an inch. They

                probably fear it will be career death to concede any failings

                whatsoever. We have consistently and clearly asked for short, easy-

                to-understand, honest and complete answers to the assertions that we

                have put forward. What we are getting are highly technical, multi-page,

                responses that will appear to many to have been crafted so as to avoid

                actually giving any answers to those assertions and allegations at all.

                Without wishing to burden you with detail, the attached is a pretty good

                example of the POL/2nd Sight dialogue... and shows my exasperation

                in trying to get them to ANSWER THE BLASTED QUESTIONS."



90. On 13th June 2013 I had a telephone conversation with Alan Bates. Janet

      Walker reported that conversation to Alwen Lyons in an email82 in which she

      says:

"1.   Alan Bates

Interim report - James had an extremely good telephone conversation

with Alan Bates today. He has asked me to let you know that Alan was

content with the proposed content of the interim report. Alan was more

concerned with what happens after this has been delivered (which is

due at a meeting to take place at Westminster on 8 July, with Ian and

Ron presenting). James touched on the point Paula has made about

potentially bringing the investigation of further cases in-house within

the Post Office. Alan said he was not entirely comfortable with this, but

James persuaded him to put this matter into abeyance for the time

being, and Alan agreed. We can return to this after the interim report

when we have all seen what it has to say.



"Media - James also discussed media with him. We are beginning to

be approached and are putting people on hold - Private Eye,

Computer Weekly, BBC Shropshire local radio. Alan said he was not

responsible for the article in this week's Private Eye, and James

believes him. Alan said he was happy not to go public on anything

while the investigation process was underway.



"2.   Meeting 8 July

Ian and Ron have agreed to present an interim report based on 3

cases to MPs, here at Westminster on 8 July. James has said to both

them and Alan that at the moment, he is not minded to invite

                representatives of the Post Office to attend, given that you will

                presumably only have just seen the report yourselves. Do you have a

                view on this? James needs to think through this a little more, so it

                would be helpful if he knew your thoughts.



                "I am going to email Ron and Ian with all this as well, but wanted to let

                you know the view from this end is good. Might you let Paula know

                please?"



91. Despite what Janet Walker says in that email, it is not clear in my mind whether

      at that stage I or Alan Bates actually knew the contents of the interim report or

      whether what was being discussed was the method of handling the report. This

      is because on 17th June 2013 Janet emailed Alwen Lyons83 to say that I was

      "about to ask Ian and Ron for a meeting on 2 July as a heads-up n the interim

      report to be delivered on 8 July. I don't know if and when Paul is expecting

      news from them about their findings, but it makes sense for James and Paul to

      talk AFTER James has been given some warning about what the interim report

      will contain." I believe "Paul" meant Paula Vennells. The email also began

      negotiations for a conversation between Paula Vennells and myself, and told

      Alwen Lyons that: "Furthermore, James is starting to talk to the media. He has

      scheduled phone calls with Private Eye and Computer Weekly which will simply

      be to let them know about the interim report and its presentation on 8 July.

      Media will not be invited to the meeting."

92. On 18th June 2013 I telephoned Private Eye about the Interim Report and also

      spoke to Karl Flinders of Computer Weekly. On 25th June 2013 I telephoned

      Matt Prodger of the BBC. According to a speaking note84 prepared for me by

      Janet Walker for the conversation with Private Eye I told them:



                Update = 47 cases under current investigation by Second Sight.

                1.   Interim report - to be presented by Second Sight to MPs on

                evening of 8 July, at Westminster.

                2.   The report will concentrate on a few (two? three?) strongest

                complaints against the Post Office.

                3.   The report should consider whether there are:

                       a.   any flaws in Horizon,

                       b.   any flaws in processes currently followed by the Post Office,

                       or training offered to staff.

                4.   The report should be absolutely clear as to whether there are

                problems with Horizon or not.

                5.   Final report — details yet to be finalised, but want something by end

                of year.



93. On 27th June 2013 I went to see the Speaker. It seems likely that I wanted to

      give him the background to the whole story in case I wanted to ask an Urgent

      Question about the Interim Report when it came out, because I did indeed a

      fortnight later put in for such a question.

94. On 2nd July 2013 I had a conference call with Second Sight at 09:00. At 10:00

      that day there is an entry in my diary to say that I was to speak on the

      telephone to Jo Swinson, the Minister with responsibility for the Post Office; I do

      not know whether that call took place nor, if it did, what was said, because there

      is an entry for the following day for a similar call.



95. On 3rd July 2013 I had a meeting at 08:45 in the House of Commons with

      Paula Vennells and Alwen Lyons. At 14:17 that day Ron Warmington wrote85 to

      Janet Walker to say,



               "Ian and I have been "summoned" to a 16:00 hrs meeting with Paula

               Vennells. We are hearing that Paula and James have agreed to a

               substantial change to the scope either of the (virtually finalised) Interim

               Report or even of the entire Investigation (I'm pre-advised that we are

               to cut the report back to only "bottomed-out SOFTWARE-related

               issues"). Either way, managing the non-POL stakeholders' and the

               media's disappointment (even anger) would be a huge challenge.

               Maybe James didn't agree to that? I'll find out from Paula in 2 hrs time

               I suppose. It might be a resignation matter."



96. Janet Walker replied at 14:3786 to say,

"Just spoken to Ian and explained that what you have written is not

quite what the meeting discussed or concluded this morning.



"No difference in scope for the interim report. No conclusion on exactly

what the entire investigation process does or where it goes from now

on - this will be something that, at least in part, comes out of Monday's

meeting.



"1. Post Office and James very keen to ensure that because of the

scope of the investigations, the definition of 'Horizon' that is used in the

report is made explicit and very very clear that it is not just the software

program, but includes interface with other programs, and the processes

and systems (help desk, training, etc.) around it. There is

understandable anxiety that when existing SubPostMasters and media

hear the word 'Horizon' (and assume it refers solely and strictly to the

computer software program only), they will immediately leap to the

conclusion that there if faults have been found and can be proved, this

is tantamount to admitting that there is a 'ghost in the machine' which

will cause enormous panic.



"2. Post Office and James very keen that what is presented in the

report is totally accurate and evidence-based.



"James will call Ian at 3.45pm on his mobile fora brief chat."

97. In fact it seems that I made that telephone call at 3:15pm (on 31d July 2013). I

      then spoke to Jo Swinson on the telephone for 10 minutes at 3:45pm and Alan

      Bates for 15 minutes at 6:00pm.



98. On 4th July 2013 Paula Vennells wrote me a letter87 in which she referred to the

      distinction between systemic issues with the Horizon system — of which she

      understood none had been found — and the wider support systems, and the

      importance of making that distinction clear.



99. On 5th July 2013 there was a further meeting between myself (as often,

      perhaps with other MPs present), Paula Vennells and Alwyn Lyons. I cannot

      remember how the discussion went.


100. 8th July 2013 was Interim Report Day. I put out an early holding Press

      Statement88, referring to a further statement which I would put out at 6pm,

      when I would be chairing a closed meeting with MPs at which Second Sight

      would release its Interim Report. At 11:00 there was a 15 minute telephone call

      between Jo Swinson and myself.



101. At some stage I received a briefing from Second Sight about the Interim Report,

      but I do not know when. They provided me with preliminary conclusions89 and I

      wrote some handwritten notes9° for my own use about my reaction to the

      Interim Report. I wrote, "It seems at the moment that the Horizon software itself

      has worked as it was meant to", but I underlined "at the moment", which

      suggests that I believed that there was more work to be done. Basing my

      comments on those notes, at 11:15 I rang Private Eye, and at 11:30 Computer

      Weekly. At 12:00 I rang Paula Vennells at her request for a "catchup".



102. At 4pm on 8th July 2013 I went to see the Speaker; he was in the chair, so I

      could not have taken long about it; I was confirming what I had already

      probably warned him about on 27th June 2013, namely that I would be asking

      for an Urgent Question the following day. I probably gave him the question now

      in my files91 which set out the background of the matter and why I felt an urgent

      question was needed. In that question I said:



               "Essentially the Report finds that the Horizon software itself seems not

               to be at fault, but the combination of defects in the way the Post Office

               dealt with concerns, sometimes inadequate training, sometimes

               unreliable hardware, an exceptionally complex system and other

               concerns all led to Sub Postmasters not having the support they should

               have had."



       This was not completely accurate, because the Interim Report had included

       the following sentence:



               "It has become clear that whereas the Horizon system appears to

               achieve its intended purpose almost all of the time and operates

                smoothly for most SPMRs and their staff, some combinations of events

                can trigger situations where problems occur"



        It also said:



                "We are aware of 2 incidents where defects or 'bugs' in the Horizon

                software gave rise to 76 branches being affected by incorrect balances

                or transactions, which took some time to identify and correct".



103. At 6pm that day, 8th July 2013, we held a meeting in the House of Commons to

      launch the Second Sight Interim Report92. Janet Walker's note of attendance93

      said that as well as MPs there were present Second Sight, Shoosmiths, Alan

      Bates, Kay Linnell and observers from the Minister's Office and the Post Office.



104. According to my own agenda94 I said that the Report was a good one — but only

      a step along the way. I thanked the Post Office for supporting and funding the

      investigation thus far, in particular Alice Perkins and Paula Vennells. I

      mentioned that I had concerns regarding the solutions that the Post Office had

      proposed (the creation of a working party, the involvement of an independent

      person and a new branch user forum) but that we'd discuss those during the

      meeting. There was then a presentation by Second Sight, 40 minutes of

      questions and the meeting closed at 7pm. I told the meeting that I envisaged a

      further meeting in the autumn to which MPs would be invited.

105. In the press statement95 I put out that evening, more detailed than the one put

        out earlier that day, I welcomed the report, saying that it did highlight some real

        issues of concern, some of which the Post Office had already addressed, some

        of which they were putting forward proposals to address, and some which

        remained unresolved. After the meeting I did media interviews on the Report.

        With Alan Bates I did the BBC at around 7pm, and I did Radio 5 Live at

        10:40pm. On 9th July 2013 at 07:02 I did Radio Surrey and at 8:08 BBC

        Shropshire.



106. On 9th July 2013 the Minister, Jo Swinson, in the event decided to make a

        statement. I expect that she knew that the Speaker would have been likely to

        have granted my urgent question if she had not. In that Statement96 she

        emphasised the arms' length nature of the relationship between the Post Office

        and its owner, the Government.



107. My own question, which shows what was uppermost in my mind about the

        Interim Report, was as follows:



                  "I thank my hon. Friend for making this valuable statement to the

                  House. Does she accept that the Post Office, which has acted highly

                  commendably in commissioning this independent review, has a conflict

                  of interest or, rather, a conflict of duty—in both looking after its sub-

             postmasters and protecting public money, and that the review has

             shown that it has fallen too far on the asset recovery side of that

             conflict? Does she agree that it is essential that the work that needs to

             be done is not only independent, but seen to be independent of the

             Post Office? Does she also agree that some sub-postmasters would

             never have been prosecuted, sued or disciplined had the new

             procedures now in place or proposed been in effect earlier, and that we

             must look after them and try to provide them with redress, perhaps

             through the Criminal Cases Review Commission?"



108. The Minister replied, saying amongst other things,



             "It is important that any further work is not only independent, but seen

             to be independent, and clearly the role of Second Sight in that is

             important, as is the role of the JFSA. I would not go as far as my right

             hon. Friend, however; there is no evidence to suggest that any

             convictions would have been different had these processes and

             training systems been in place, particularly given that in most of the

             prosecutions dealt with in the report—not all 47 cases in the report

             resulted in a prosecution—the sub-postmaster pleaded guilty in the first

             place. It is difficult to second guess when somebody has entered a

             guilty plea."



109. The questions which were asked during the Statement were in some respects

     prescient of what was later to be found by Mr Justice Fraser, and showed a


                                      Page 57 of 193
                                                                                                 WITN00020100




        concern about the Post Office's behaviour that the Interim Report had not

        dispelled. I would particularly draw attention to the question by Andrew

        Bridgen MP, Michael Rudkin's MP, in which he said:



                  "Having been involved in this issue for some time and having initially

                  been told by Post Office representatives that the Horizon software

                  system was perfect and could not be infiltrated, I am pleased that the

                  Post Office is co-operating with the independent investigation"...



          He was to return to that theme in a debate the following year.




110. On the morning of Thursday 11th July 2013 at 09:15 there was a wash-up

        meeting at the Post Office headquarters at Old Street between Paula Vennells,

        Alwen Lyons, Janet Walker and me with Alan Bates joining by telephone. To

        prepare for that meeting Janet Walker emailed me some notes97, which I will

        have followed. Those notes said:



                  "To raise / discuss



                  "Second Sight continuing involvement



                  "1.   It is worth your raising, if not fully resolving, the fact that Second

                  Sight really ought to continue to be involved. Whilst the terms of their

involvement are not our concern, the fact that they continue to be

involved and in what capacity, is. Ian Henderson has called to express

some anxiety that neither he nor Ron have heard from the PO since

just before the meeting on 8 July. Not entirely surprising. But he did say

that given the Ministerial agreement with MP's comments in the

statement that Second Sight's continued involvement is necessary, it is

a bit unnerving. Second Sight appears to be on some kind of rolling

`agreement' based on an hourly rate rather than having a contract. Not

our problem, but worth knowing the agreement seems tenuous rather

than formal.



"2.   lan also mentioned that he rather expects PO full cooperation to

drop off, given the hammering it has taken. I pointed out that this would

not be in the interests of PO, and that they would probably see this.

However, he did ask what escalation point might he be able to use over

summer if his requests for data / documents / cooperation were not

met. I said, come to me. I did not say, James is available if absolutely

necessary — they should be able to sort this out themselves. But it's

worth you just bearing in mind. lan, Ron, and Alan know recess dates,

my holiday dates, and I have said that you are pretty much unavailable

during summer.



"3.   Said has never heard from Ministerial office, should he expect to?

I said probably not now, but would check your view on this.

                     "October meeting

                     "Shall we mull over what might comprise an October meeting (14? 21?

                     28?), and get that in the diary now, with forewarning to Second Sight

                 and PO? You've said that at this meeting, the PO ought to be in a

                 position to respond to investigation findings and speak directly to the

                 MPs. I'd suggest a date for the meeting, then let PO and Second Sight

                     work out between themselves what needs to be done to get them

                     there. Good pressure to keep things moving.

                 proceed. Should they be acknowledged by and held at this office or

                 PO?"



111. It appears that we contemplated a further meeting on 22nd or 23rd July 2013,

         because Janet Walker sent Alwen Lyons an email98 to that effect that day (11th

         July 2013). That afternoon Alan Bates sent Janet Walker an email99 proposing

         a set of steps to deal with the historic cases. Janet forwarded it to Alwen Lyons

        with a comment from me that I thought Alan Bates's ideas were quite

        outstanding.

112. It is worth noting here that the Clarke advice about Dr Gareth Jenkins was

      dated 15th July 2013, and so presumably had been commissioned some time

      beforehand. I was aware neither of the commissioning nor of the receipt of the

      Clarke advice.



113. On 17th July 2013 I met Simon Blagden, the non-executive Chairman of

      Fujitsu. The reason for the meetinglw was that he wanted to talk to me as

      Chairman of the Defence Select Committee about the recent MoD White Paper

      which outlined the next stages in the move to transform DE&S (Defence

      Equipment and Support). I had had several meetings with Mr Blagden to talk

      about defence; but I also raised with him at that meeting the issue of Horizon.

      On 18th July 2013 he wrote to mel01 to agree to a visit to the Fujitsu offices (I

      accepted on 9th August 2013). In his email he said,



                 "With regards to The Post Office, as discussed, I really do think that a

                 continued open and inclusive engagement with Paula Vermeils would

                be the best way forward. I hold her in very high regard and she is

                 without doubt the most morally and socially aware CEO that I deal with.

                I always think with these kind of sensitive situations that agreeing a

                 common approach on the issues is often best for the people who are

                affected. Do let me know if you think I can help in any way."

114. On 22nd July 2013 there was a meeting at the Post Office between Paula

      Vennells, Ian Henderson and myself. The Post Office notes102 sent on 23rd

      July 2013 say that there were also present Ron Warmington, Susan Crichton,

      Mark Davies and Alwen Lyons. The preparatory notes103 I have for that

      meeting read as follows:



                "1.     What is going to be delivered in October?

                2.      Will it answer the question MPs will want answered regarding their

                constituent?

                3.     If any cases are to be dropped from this batch, we MUST know

                who they are, who the relevant MP is, and why they are being dropped,

                so I can write to the MPs and explain

                4.     How are we going defining the process by which new cases will be

                investigated?

                     am now holding 6 new cases, one of which goes to court next week"



115. At the meeting we were given a flow chart104 prepared by the Post Office to set

      out how cases would be dealt with. I believe that the meeting went as set out in

      the email from Alwen Lyons. From what I can now remember, I firmly believed

      that the Post Office were dealing in good faith with the matter, and that

      everyone was working towards a full resolution of all the outstanding cases.

      There were probably at the back of my mind niggling doubts arising from the

      legalistic approach to Second Sight's investigations, and their failure to answer

      the questions Second Sight were putting to them, and their over-confident

      backing of the Horizon system in their response to the Interim Report, but I

      believed I was dealing with people who were able to work through any

      problems and get to the right result.



116. On 29th July 2013 Susan Crichton emailed me105 to tell me about the first

      meeting of the Working Party and the details of the mediation process which

      the Post Office were proposing.



117. From 20th to 24th August 2013 I was in Scotland on holiday. Susan Crichton

      and Alwen Lyons met Janet Walker106 to discuss "the mediation process which

      has been agreed with the JFSA and SS". As a result of that meeting Janet

      emailed me the documentation for my comments, and I returned some pretty

      detailed comments as set out in Janet Walker's email107 to Susan Crichton and

      Alwen Lyons of 21st August 2013. I had suggested to Janet that the eventual

      announcement should include the words from me,



                "I am very pleased indeed with the working group's proposed process.

                To my mind it represents the very best chance all parties — individual

                subPost Masters and Mistresses, and the Post Office — have of

                ensuring the best outcome for everyone. It is fair, thorough and

                independent."

118. I was proposing Sir Stephen Sedley, a retired Court of Appeal Judge, to chair

      the mediation process, and Janet Walker was sending on a further list of new

      cases that had come into my office.



119. There was a telephone call between Paula Vennells and myself while I was on

      a fishing boat near Oban; the purpose of the call was to iron out some details

      about the Mediation Scheme that had been agreed at earlier meetings. The

      call was amicable and constructive, and I certainly believed at the time that

      matters were on the right track and indeed going well.



120. In the event it seems that the Post Office gave to the NFSP the task of

      announcing the mediation scheme, which they did on 27th August 2013108,

      including the quote from me. On that day I did an interview with BBC South

      about Jo Hamilton and the mediation process. I did it outside Jo Hamilton's

      shop in South Warnborough109, and she will have been there too. The thought

      that the Post Office might eventually exclude Jo Hamilton from the mediation

      scheme did not cross my mind for a moment.



121. Also on 27th August 2013 I responded to a blogpost by Nick Wallis, and said110:



                "Good stuff, and / know you will keep your eye on this extremely

                important issue. But one thing I would challenge you on, namely the

                payment by the Post Office for the investigation by Second Sight. The

                very fact that they were prepared to do that suggested to me that they

                did want, perhaps against their own apparent interest, to resolve the

                matter for the good of everyone, themselves included. I thought that

                was creditable.



                "And someone had to pay for it. I wasn't going to, the Government

                wouldn't have forked out money from somewhere else to do so, and

                the Post Office offered to do so despite the risk to their reputation.

                That does contrast (well, IMHO) with the cover ups we've seen

                elsewhere in the public sector."



122. Apparently Angela Van Den Bogerd wrote" 1 on the same day to Alan (Bates, I

      presume) about the Mediation Scheme.



123. On 11th September 2013 there was a meeting in the House of Commons

      between Alice Perkins, Alwen Lyons and myself. The questions which Janet

      Walker suggested in the notes112 to that meeting were:



                ""* has a decision been made re chairman of new working party (JNA

                suggested Sir Stephen Sedley)

                * October meeting with MPs - we had promised this."

124. I understand that during September 2013 Susan Crichton left the Post Office. I

     do not know why she left, but it may be important, because it was (I now see,

     looking back on it) around about this time that the Post Office's approach

     changed. Their change of attitude may have been because they had been

     expecting Second Sight (whom Susan Crichton had recommended) to give

     Horizon a clean bill of health, which Second Sight had not done. The Post

     Office clearly did not like that.



125. Alternatively or additionally it may have been partly because Susan Crichton's

     replacement, Chris Aujard, brought a different tone to the Post Office's

     dealings. I cannot exactly put my finger on it. I felt uncomfortable with him and

     thought him uncommitted to the process we were going through. I cannot at

     this remove in time give details of what he said or did or in which meetings to

     give rise to that feeling, but I do remember thinking that things were somehow

     different — less open, more combative - because of him.

        MEDIATION SCHEME GETS UNDERWAY



126. Some time before the end of September 2013 Janet Walker on my behalf sent

      an email113 to MPs who had been involved in the Horizon matter. She set out

      the details of the mediation scheme, and said that while the results of the

      continuing investigations had been hoped for by October 2013, I was now

      delaying the meeting until January in order to hear how investigations were

      going, how the internal review of processes at the Post Office was going, and

      perhaps to hear from the chairman of the Working Party.



127. On 1st October 2013 I did a TV interview with BBC Wales. In the emails114

      setting up the interview, of which the subject was "Interview with James

      Arbuthnot MP, 3pm, 1 Oct, at Tory Party Conf, re Post office", I was asked:



                 "I also understand he received an email the day before yesterday from

                 the JFSA about an attempted suicide by one of the posymasters [sic] —

                 the second one to try to kill themselves over discrepancies between

                 them and the PO. Is he happy to respond to that email from the JFSA

                in our programme?"



        I have no information in my files about what I said.

128. Also that day, 1st October 2013, I had a meeting with executives from Fujitsu;

      the diary notes concern only defence, but it is possible that at that meeting I

      also raised the issue of Horizon. Both of the attempts of my office to arrange a

      Fujitsu visit failed by 11th October 2013, so we tried to organise another day.



129. On 28th October 2013 Alwen Lyons emailed Janet Walker and me15 to say that

      the Post Office were just about to announce the appointment of Sir Anthony

      Hooper as chairman of the Mediation Scheme. Sir Anthony had been proposed

      by Kay Linnell and was supported by Alan Bates.



130. From 1St to 3rd November 2013 I attended a British-Turkish conference in

      Edinburgh. Alice Perkins also attended and it seems that at some stage during

      that conference she and I spoke about the Horizon issue. I cannot remember

      the conversation.



131. On 4th November 2013 it seems that Paula Vennells emailed Chris Aujard and

      Alice Perkins116 to say that I had spoken to her (Paula Vennells) about Sparrow.

      I do not know what had caused me to do that — clearly I had raised the matter

      with her rather than the other way round - nor whether this was the first time I

      had heard of Sparrow, nor what if anything I knew about Sparrow, nor what she

      told me.

132. It seems I also described Sir Anthony Hooper as "quirky" but I cannot

      remember that. I am not sure whether I have ever met him. I do remember

      being perfectly content with his appointment, not least because he was

      supported by Alan Bates. I see from a note117 of a meeting in January 2014,

      the following year, that I said I had received feedback that he was a really good

      man doing a really good job.



133. On 26th November 2013 Alice Perkins sent me a letter118 referring to the

      conversation she and I had had in Edinburgh. She said that she and I had

      agreed to arrange a date to discuss the progress being made on the Post

      Office's commitments. She said that the mediation scheme was taking longer

      than at first envisaged, so that it would be better for us to meet in the New Year

      rather than earlier.



134. On 10th December 2013 Alan Bates emailed Janet Walker119 to ask for a

      telephone conversation with me which took place the following day. He wanted

      "a short conversation in the near future to discuss a concern that may arise in

      the future, before we arrive at that point". Janet Walker wrote to Alan Bates on

      11th December 2013120 to tell him about the meeting it was proposed I was to

      have with Alice Perkins and Paula Vennells on 28th January 2014, suggesting

      that my conversation with Alan should take place shortly before that, and also

      to say:

                 "what he will need [that is to say, I believe, what I would need] is

                evidence. lf, as you suggest, current practice is not changing despite

                processes being reviewed and cases investigated, he will need very

                 clear description (no names are required) about what is going wrong,

                 when, and why this indicates that processes are in fact not being

                 changed as the mediation process proceeds. I am sure you are

                keeping a log of what you are hearing, and this would be useful to refer

                 to."



135. On or about Wednesday 8th January 2014 Alan Bates called Janet Walker121

      and asked for a confidential chat with me. He told her that the mediation

      scheme was running, but that the Post Office were putting some pressure on

      Second Sight — he was vague about quite what — and that Ron Warmington

      was getting to the stage where he was thinking of walking out. Alan Bates

      wanted to talk to me and brief me on the background. It appears that that

      telephone conversation between Alan Bates and me took place the following

      day, 9th January 2014. I do not have a note of what was said.



136. A note122 of a telephone conversation on 10th January 2014 between Janet

      Walker and Ian Henderson reads as follows:



                 "JKW spoke to Ian H, and there are problems with PO/Second Sight

                relationship. lH has written to new head of legal about contract, and

                 waiting for response. Will contact JKW when he receives answer, and

                 take it from there. JKW mentioned JNA meeting with Alice and Paula

                on 28 Jan, and asked for telephone call to be pencilled in, in case JNA

                needs to raise anything with Alice / Paula regarding this. Suggested to

                lH that if problems are not resolved, he ought to raise them with

                 working group chairman BEFORE speaking to JNA."



        Things were starting to go slightly (at that stage) wrong.



137. On 20th January 2014 Janet Walker wrote to Second Sight123 about the

      telephone call to take place before my meeting with the Post Office to take

      place on 28th January. She asked whether there was a satisfactory agreement

      in place with the Post Office and also said,



                 "it is clear that a January update meeting for MPs is not going to

                happen, but I think something ought to be done to let them know how

                 the mediation process is going, at what stage the investigations are at,

                and when the cases will be moved on to the next stage. Two MPs in

                particular are beginning to ask questions: Andrew Bridgen has raised

                 the matter of compensation (Alan and Kay are looking into this); and

                Mike Wood is asking how things are going with his constituent. Would

                a report from Second Sight be a good idea, I wonder? Perhaps ahead

                of a February meeting with MPs? I think it is be important to keep MPs

                up-to-date with what is going on, and it might be helpful to Second

                Sight and the JSFA in keeping pressure on the Post Office."



138. On 27th January 2014 at 2:45 pm the telephone call with Second Sight took

      place. And at 5pm there was a telephone call with Alan Bates. I do not have

      notes of what was said in either of those calls, but whatever it was will have

      been reflected in the speaking notes that Janet Walker prepared for my

      subsequent meeting with the Post Office.



139. At 09:30 on 28th January 2014 there was a meeting with the Post Office in my

      room in the House of Commons. The agenda124 (from the looks of its

      formatting it appears to have been provided by Janet Walker) covered the

      following subjects:



                "1.    The mediation scheme — how it is going; what will be reported to

                MPs, how, and when; matters surrounding compensation; external

                review of past cases that went to court

                 2.    Second Sight — relationship with them including agreement as to

                 what they are doing and for whom

                 3.    JFSA — relationship between POL and the Association

                5.     Business Improvement Programme

140. Janet Walker didspeaking notes125 for me for the meeting. These will have

      been partly based on the telephone conversations I had had with Second Sight

      and Alan Bates. The notes read as follows:



                Mediation Scheme



                 1.    How is this going?

                a.      147 cases have applied

                b.     How many have reached mediation?

                 c.     Only half a day or one day allocated for mediation — is this

                enough?

                d.      Understand that results are not binding — on either SubPM or

                Post Office. Is this true? What are consequences of this?

                e.      Chairman — how long is he contracted for?



                 2.    Reporting progress to MPs — when and how and in what detail?

                a.     Do confidentiality terms mean that constituents will not be able

                 to talk to their MPs?



                 3.    Reporting results to MPs — individual cases, cases in total, when

                and how

                a.      Second Sight producing a Thematic Report (previously called

                Mediators Briefing Document) — sounds ideal for circulation

                4.    Are there any exclusions on what can be made public?

                a.    Reporting problems with Horizon — should they be found



                5.    Compensation

                a.    Is there contingency for this?

                b.    Is there someone of sufficient authority on the working group

                that will be empowered to make offers from POL without having to

                revert to senior management?



                6.    External review of past and current litigation — what were the

                results?



                7.    Any future plans for second tranche of mediation for new cases

                that come to light?



141. It seems from the Post Office notes126 of the meeting that there were present

      Alice Perkins, Paula Vennells, Janet Walker, David Oliver (the programme

      manager of the mediation scheme) and myself. I raised a number of points. I

      wondered how MPs would be kept in touch with the scheme. I asked about the

      turnover of the staff on the scheme, and about Second Sight's employment. I

      asked about a final report, and said that Second Sight were being prevented

      from talking to MPs about their own constituents. It seems from the note that

      Paula Vennells told me Second Sight's engagement letter was not designed to

      restrict in any way Second Sight's ability to investigate issues with Horizon.

      This was not the first time that she had promised access for Second Sight to

      any document or file that was relevant to their investigations.



142. But she then said that Second Sight would not be advising Post Office on

      criminal cases or prosecution policy as they were forensic accountants and not

      lawyers. I believe that at the time this struck me as wrong. It was at odds with

      what she had just said about not restricting Second Sight's ability to investigate

      the issues with Horizon. Accountants in their training and work have a great

      deal to do with criminal cases and prosecution. The Post Office notes do not

      record that made this point at the time, but since I accepted her offer of a

      meeting to discuss it (itself a strange proposal, given that we were already

      having a meeting) it seems probable that I was sceptical. Looking back on it

      now, I believe she was following the recommendations of Chris Aujard and

      Angela Van Den Bogerd.



143. On 4th February 2014 I sent an email127 to MP colleagues including the

      following words:



                "I would like to mention a couple of matters in advance of the meeting.

                The mediation scheme is running, and we must take care both to

                respect the privacy of individual applicants and to avoid skewing the

                mediation process. Individual cases will not be up for discussion, but I

                am sure that if any colleague wanted to seek a separate meeting with

                Post Office to discuss an individual case, Post Office would be happy

                  to arrange this separately."



        This, according to Janet Walker, was an offer made by the Post Office.



144. At close of play on Friday 7th February 2014 David Oliver sent Janet Walker an

      email128 containing the draft minutes of the meeting. Janet Walker, having

      spoken to me, replied to him on 11th February 2014 to raise three points. First,

      I wanted Paula Vennells to confirm that Second Sight were at liberty to discuss

      matters with me, as the JFSA was. Second I wanted her to confirm that, if

      problems arose with Horizon, Second Sight were at liberty to investigate — in

      other words, there were no "no-go" areas in the investigations. Third I wanted

      her to meet Second Sight to iron out a letter of agreement. These were issues

      on which clearly I had reservations about the Post Office's approach, and which

      were reminding me of the concerns I felt the previous summer about Post

      Office defensiveness and legalism. I also proposed an agenda for the meeting

      with MPs that was eventually to take place. I would have expected there to be

      some response to that email of 11th February 2014, but do not have a copy in

      my files.



145. Oliver Heald MP wrote to me on 19th February 2014 about one of his

      constituents; I do not have a copy of his letter. On 5th March 2014 I wrote a

      letter to him to say that the mediation scheme had now closed but that he

      would be welcome to attend a meeting I would be chairing on Monday 24

      March 2014, at 5.45pm in Room T, Portcullis House.



146. On 14th March 2014 Janet Walker emailed me to say that Paula Vennells

      wanted to speak to me on the telephone, a call eventually agreed to take place

      on 18th March 2014. She emailed David Oliver at the Post Office on 17th March

      2014129 to say:



                 "One thing that has come up which he would like to cover is the

                agenda for the meeting next week. What has been proposed is as

                follows:



                 1.   Welcome and into — JNA for 5 mins

                 2.   Update on progress with mediation scheme and business

                improvement programme — PV for 15 mins

                 3.   Second Sight update — 10 mins

                 4.   JFSA update — 10 mins

                 5.   Q&A — 20 mins



                Is Paula content with this? Second Sight have expressed some

                 concern in that they feel they cannot, and should not, speak on behalf

                of the Working Group. However, they can offer their perspective on the

                investigations. I have spoken to Ian just now and he understands that it

                 would be inappropriate to go into details given that the investigations

                are still works in progress, and that gesturing towards any conclusions

                at this stage would not be wise. This would be something it would be

                very good for Paula and James to cover."



147. On 20th March 2014 David Oliver wrote an email130 to Janet Walker beginning,

      "Following on from the call Paula undertook to provide James with a draft email

      he could send to interested colleagues about the restrictions around what we

      can and can't say." He also asked whether Janet and I were happy with

      amendments he had made to the minutes — presumably of the meeting of 28111

      January 2014. Janet replied immediately that on 4th February 2014 I had sent

      an email to MP colleagues telling them something slightly different from what

      David Oliver was now proposing, and also saying that she had sent an email

      some time before agreeing the amendments. However I do not have a copy

      either of the amendments proposed by David Oliver nor of Janet Walker's

      approval of those amendments. It seems that David Oliver tried to speak on

      the telephone to Janet Walker following receipt of her email of 20th March 2014.



148. I do not have notes of the meeting that took place on 24th March 2014 but I

      have seen the Post Office notes131. I do not question the accuracy of the Post

      Office notes. They include the comment,

                "In the short term the Second Sight reference to the thematic report

                and it somehow being shared with MPs is a concern and we are

                prepared for the potential leaking of the report."



149. This comment appears to be at odds with the Post Office's professed intention

      to be open and transparent. Perhaps the meeting of 24th March 2014 — which

      the Post Office describes as "difficult" - was the time that I truly began to sense

      a changed attitude from the Post Office. The reluctance by Chris Aujard and

      Paula Vennells to discuss compensation, combined with my own determination

      to return to the issue, will have suggested to me that we might be on divergent

      tracks.



150. On 26th March 2014 I wrote132 to Paula Vennells to try to get a date for a

      meeting in July in our diaries but also to say:



                "I know you sensed that MPs are beginning to want to hear something

                more than that the cases are going through mediation. There was

                some dismay, I thought, at the prospect mentioned that even when the

                mediation process is complete, MPs are not going to get a chance to

                hear the result of investigations. I am fairly certain this will not wash

                and that something is going to have to be offered by way of reported

                results, even if only on a generic basis.

                "Everyone understands the point about the integrity and independence

                of the working group being respected, but the reason this entire

                process has been instigated is that MPs agitated on behalf of their

                constituents for it. Given that Second Sight are producing a report

                within days, I think it is quite justifiable that MPs believe that results of

                some description are being arrived at, and we are getting hungry to

                know what they are. Might a report be made available soon, or can

                results be made known at this July meeting? Perhaps you can let me

                know your thoughts about this?"



        I was — and MPs were — beginning to feel frustrated at the Post Office's

        secretiveness.



151. On 1st April 2014 I emailed MPs133 and said (amongst other things) that Alan

      Bates was expressing frustration and:



                "I remain concerned that the process is taking much longer than

                anyone wants and also that we were not given any indication of when

                any investigation might yield results, and what exactly we might be told

                about those results. Given that investigators were on the verge of

                producing a report on 26th March about their work and handing this to

                the working group, I have also asked when MPs might be offered some

                more substantial news.

                "I have therefore written to Paula Vennells, the CEO who attended the

                meeting, expressing these points and requested another meeting

                which I hope could take place in July. ...



                "I have said to the Post Office that I remain confident that the mediation

                process remains the best possible opportunity for this matter to be

                resolved, but that we need to see some results, and soon. I ask you to

                be patient a while longer."



152. On 11th April 2014 Paula Vennells replied134 to my letter of 26th March 2014 to

      say that she was not supportive of a further interim report because it would

      have the potential to damage the integrity of the scheme, and that a meeting in

      July 2014 would serve no purpose because there would be no more to discuss

      then; it should wait until September 2014.



153. On 1st May 2014 I replied135:



                "May I make two points in response to your letter? The first is that

                whilst I appreciate that an interim report is slightly disruptive of the

                Mediation Scheme's progress, I am not so sure that preliminary

                findings cannot be shared in a manner that respects the Scheme's

                integrity. Given that the investigators were issuing the Post Office with

                a report in late March, surely by now they have been able to draw

       some conclusions about the cases before them. Doing so would not

       intrude on the confidentiality of any individual case. And would it not be

       fair to share these, given that the group of MPs whose constituents

       have been affected have been partially (with the Post Office and the

       JSFA) responsible for getting these investigations underway? Second,

      if a July meeting is unimaginable, can you offer me a date when a

       further meeting will be considered, please?



       "I understand all the points that you make and have some sympathy

       with the position you adopt. However, I am anxious that the longer the

       silence, the more concerned MPs will get. This relates not just to their

       own constituency cases but to the processes which had been followed

       at the Post Office which led to so many individuals coming forward.

       This entire matter has the potential to run away from our control,

       something neither you nor I want to see happen. In short, I am slightly

       worried.



       "I wonder if you might let me have your thoughts please? In order to

       dampen expectations about a July meeting, I would like to circulate

       your letter of 11 April to those MPs involved, but I feel I should give you

       an opportunity to think these points through before I do so."



By my standards I was irritated.

154. On 6th May 2014 I had a meeting with Clark Vasey of Fujitsu. In the emails

      organising that meeting my diary secretary reminded Fujitsu that I was hoping

      for a visit to see their operations in my constituency. On 13th June 2014 that

      visit took place, and there is no evidence of any discussion of Horizon — it

      appears to have been an entirely defence orientated visit.



155. On 14th May 2014 Paula Vennells wrote to me136 in reply to my letter of 1s1 May

      2014. She said that the scheme was making progress, but that every stage

      was taking longer than originally envisaged. She said that Second Sight had

      only just submitted their first case review, and that given the slow process of

      their case reviews, a thematic report should not be the focus of their efforts.

      She also made a complaint that Alan Bates had written to Jenny Willott MP, and

      she said that this was in breach of the confidential nature of the Working Group,

      that the Working Group Chair had written to the Minister about it and that Alan

      Bates's letter had contained various inaccuracies.



156. On 20th May 2014 I replied137 to say that I was taken aback by the fact that only

      one review had been completed thus far, and to ask what she suggested I

      should tell MPs about why things were taking so long. As for her complaint

      about Alan Bates, I was inclined to forgive him and asked why it might have

      been that he had not felt able to approach either Sir Anthony Hooper or her with

      his concerns. But I also wrote to Alan Bates136 to say that he probably should

      have raised the issues with Sir Anthony Hooper or Paula Vennells rather than

      the Minister. I probably felt that the prediction in my letter of 1st May 2014 that

      things might run away from our control was beginning to come true. I

      suggested to both Paula Vennells and Alan Bates a meeting between the three

      of us to clear the air.



157. It appears that on 22nd May 2014 Second Sight produced Part 1 of a Mediation

      Briefing Report139. I cannot say when I saw this. It is linked to Part 2 which

      contains the conclusions of Second Sight's continuing investigations, and in

      view of the absence of those conclusions I would probably have waited until

      seeing them before forming a view.



158. On 12th June 2014 Paula Vennells replied140 to my letter of 20th May 2014. She

      wanted to discuss with Sir Anthony Hooper an update — which she thought

      would be helpful - to be provided to MPs. She did not think a "clear the air"

      discussion with Alan Bates was needed but she would keep the offer in mind.



159. On 2nd July 2014 Paula Vennells wrote to me141 enclosing an annex from Sir

      Anthony Hooper giving a brief update on the mediation scheme. I was

      disappointed with it. I replied on 8th July 2014142, as follows:



                "I understand your reticence about reporting anything further to MPs

                than is covered by the Annex to your letter. I will circulate this to the

group who will, I suspect, be disappointed that no further news can be

offered.



"What I propose to write to them via email is as follows:



       "I had hoped that we could schedule a meeting before summer

       during which the Post Office might offer us an update on how

       the mediation scheme is progressing. To this end I have been in

       correspondence with Paul Vennells, the Chief Executive. I attach

       an update from her office, which I have just received.



       It appears that not a great deal can be added to what was said

       in our last meeting. I see no point in trying to push for a meeting

       which offers no further detail than we heard at the last.



       "I understand and am concerned that the investigations and

       reviews are taking longer than any of us anticipated. It is

       possible (though I have not been told so) that the Post Office

       considers that nothing can be said about any individual case

       until something can be said about all of them. Perhaps there is a

       risk in the mind of Sir Anthony Hooper that to release the result

       of one case might create pressure on another.

                        "I intend to press the Post Office on this point, to reconfirm the

                         need to give us all some substantial information, and to come

                         back to you with a further update in September



                        "I hope you might be content with this approach."



                  "I plan on sending this at the end of this week. If you would like to

                  suggest any amendments, could you do so by close of play Thursday

                  10 July please?"



160. Paula Vennells emailed me on 10th July 2014143 to put a slightly better gloss on

        things.



161. On 11th July 2014 Alan Bates telephoned Janet Walker. Her note144 to me of

        that conversation reads as follows:



                  "Alan spoke to JKW. Working Group meeting this week has ended

                  rather badly. Alan feels that Second Sight's role is being changed as

                  independent arbiters of whether cases ought to proceed to mediation is

                  being changed [sic]. Has spoken to Tony Hooper who has given Alan 2

                  weeks to make a case that Second Sight should be the decision maker

                  as to whether or not cases proceed to mediation. Alan wants to know

                  JNA's views on what he and other MPs believe Second Sight's role is.

                "At the moment, Second Sight investigates. At the end of the

                investigation, they make a recommendation as to whether a case goes

                to mediation or not. This is then debated at Working Group, where

                there are two votes, Post Office and JSFA. If the vote is split, then Tony

                Hooper makes a decision.



                "Alan's point is that surely Second Sight's recommendation should be

                regarded as final, and that not allowing this to be the case interferes

                with the independence of the process."



162. On 15th July 2014 two things happened. I had a telephone call with Alan Bates

      arising out of his previous conversation with Janet Walker. I do not have notes

      of my conversation with him. And second Janet Walker sent Paula Vennells a

      redraft of the email145 I was going to send MPs that was a little less downbeat

      than my first draft and asking for a telephone call between her and me to

      discuss that redraft. That telephone call was due to take place and probably

      did on 17th July 2014.



163. Probably on 17" July 2014 — after my conversation with Paula Vennells - I

      emailed MPs146 as follows:

"I had hoped that we might schedule a meeting before summer during

which the Post Office might offer us an update on how the mediation

scheme is progressing. To this end I have been in correspondence with

Paula Vennells, the Chief Executive, to see what might be arranged.



It appears that not a great deal can be added to what was said in our

last meeting. The mediation scheme is progressing, but at a slower

pace than any of us would have liked. Rather than hold a meeting just

before Recess that will not reveal more than we already know, I would

rather wait until autumn, but I do want to get a date in the diary for a

meeting then.



I attach a note that Paula has sent which sets out the progress made

since our last meeting. She has reiterated to me that the integrity of the

mediation scheme requires that confidentiality of cases be respected.

In her letter to me she has also said that individual case details may

not be shared with us at any point, including at the end of the Scheme.



I would like to believe that at the end of the Scheme we will be

presented with a report which shows why and how we got to the stage

where hundreds of individuals were (and still are) coming forward with

their concerns and their often harrowing stories. I do believe that the

mediation scheme has a good chance of righting things, but we shall all

need clarity as to what happened and why, and how it is being put

right."

164. On 4th August 2014 Janet Walker forwarded on my behalf an email from the

     office of Steve Webb MP about a constituent of his.

        THE BREAKDOWN OF RELATIONS




165. On 21st August 2014 Second Sight produced Part 2 of its Initial Complaint

      Review and Mediation Scheme Briefing Report147. In my files I also have a

      document called "Post Office — Second Sight Report — Part 2"148 which is also

      from August 2014. I believe it must have been provided to me by Second

      Sight, and it is a useful summary of the conclusions of the full report and I

      would have read them together. I do not, however, know when I saw it.



166. The report contains many points that were damning. Whether at the time I saw

      it I recognised quite how damning they were is less clear in my mind. There is

      no reference, for example, to the Post Office or Fujitsu being able to access

      Horizon remotely, something I remember being concerned about. But the

      question, "Is Horizon fit for purpose", is answered by Second Sight's conclusion

      — no. Uppermost in my own mind was always the question, have the actions

      taken against these subpostmasters, whether disciplinary, litigious or

      prosecutory, been fair, and are the results safe? The conclusion I would have

      drawn from the summary whenever I did see it was, "Almost certainly not, and

      certainly not in every case".



167. By this stage I had come to trust Ron Warmington and Ian Henderson. My

      feeling about their approach was that they were straightforward, open,

      competent, and experienced in the issues with which we were all dealing. I had

      completely abandoned my initial suspicion of their (or at least Ron

      Warmington's) past friendship with Susan Crichton and the fact that they were

      being funded by the Post Office. At the same time the Post Office personnel

      with whom I was dealing had become defensive, legalistic and determined to

      keep from MPs information about which they had previously promised to be

      open. Where there was a dispute between Second Sight and the Post Office I

      therefore felt more inclined to favour Second Sight's version.



168. On 28th August 2014 Priti Patel MP wrote to me about a constituent of hers. I

      do not have a copy of her letter, but my reply to her149 of 4th September 2014

      said,



                 "I know he is not alone in finding the length of time that is being taken

                 to investigate his case frustrating.



                 "I am afraid there is nothing I can do to increase the pace of

                investigation. I too would like to see these cases resolved more swiftly

                 than is currently happening. The investigators are being extremely

                diligent in gathering and then wading through a great deal of

                information in each of the 150 cases they are investigating and so I

                 would counsel patience, not least as I remain convinced that this

                process offers Mr Ward the very best chance of seeing his complaint

                resolved.

                 "I am glad you have written to the Chief Executive. Your letter will help

                her to see how very keen constituency MPs are to see this matter

                resolved, and it will have applied just the right pressure required to

                ensure she knows this is true in I        l's case."



169. On 4th September 2014 I wrote to Paula Vennells15° asking for a meeting with

      her and Jimmy Hood MP about a constituent of his.



170. On 5th September 2014 Angela Van Den Bogerd wrote to Second Sight's'

      asking Second Sight to reconsider their recommendation that a particular case

      was suitable for mediation. The reason she gave boiled down to the fact that

      the applicant had pleaded guilty in court to false accounting and theft, so that

      there was no basis left for mediation. I do not know how I have the letter of 5th

      September 2014 in my files. While it looks as though it came from Second

      Sight, I cannot be sure of that. Nor do I know when I first saw it. But whenever

      I did see it, if the same logic were applied to all of the cases where there had

      been guilty pleas, then the basis of the mediation scheme would have been

      fundamentally changed.



171. It had always been obvious that the mediation scheme would not have been

      able to alter convictions in courts. In the question I had asked in the statement

      on the floor of the House of Commons on 9th July 2013 after the production of

      Second Sight's Interim Review I had said



                 "we must look after them and try to provide them with redress, perhaps

                 through the Criminal Cases Review Commission".



172. The MPs had always regarded the mediation scheme as being one step on the

      way to, rather than the entire process of, the potential exoneration of those who

      had been found or who had pleaded guilty. It would be fair to say that we had

      not worked out a process of what to do should someone's conviction (whether

      through a finding of a court or a plea of guilty) turn out to be based on evidence

      that was wrong, untrue or unfair, but I believed that the first step was to

      establish the validity of the evidence, which was what Second Sight and the

      mediation scheme were doing. The Post Office now seemed to be treating its

      own lack of power to overturn court decisions as being a reason not even to

      admit applicants into the mediation scheme to work out whether those court

      decisions had been based on evidence that was true and fair. This was not

      what MPs had agreed to.



173. I have in my files a letter152 dated 9th September 2014 from Steve McCabe MP,

      about a constituent of his (see paragraph 175 below).

174. On 13th September 2014 I went to see Kay Linnell who, like Jo Hamilton, was a

      constituent of mine. The briefing note153 in my papers prepared for me by

      Janet Walker shows that the meeting was about the details of the case of Jo

      Hamilton, whom Kay Linnell was advising.



175. Janet Walker replied to Steve McCabe MP's letter on 15th September 2014 to

      say that I was forwarding such out of time cases to the Post Office, and she

      wrote to Paula Vennells doing so. Also on 15th September 2014 Janet Walker

      forwarded to Steve Webb MP the brief reply she had had from the Post Office

      about his constituent. On 16th September 2014 the Post Office acknowledged

      receipt of the letter from Steve McCabe MP about his constituent.



176. On 17th September 2014 I wrote154 to Paula Vennells (copying it to Sir Anthony

      Hooper and Alan Bates) as follows:



                 "Alan Bates telephoned my office today following the Working Group

                meeting which I believe was held earlier this week. He expressed

                 concern about how the meetings were proceeding and mentioned that

                 three solicitors were present during the last one, all from the Post

                 Office's side. I wonder whether this has the effect of interfering with

                 what is meant to be an independent group? Might you think about

                making these meetings a little less lawyerly'?

                Also, might you let me have an answer to my letter of 4 September

                2014 to you please about meeting with my colleague Jim Hood MP and

                myself?"



177. On 22nd September 2012 the Post Office wrote to me saying they would look

      into the constituent's case raised by Steve Webb MR



178. In the Post Office's reply155 to Second Sight's Initial Complaint Review and

      Mediation Scheme Briefing Report dated 22nd September 2014 the Post Office

      said it was unable to endorse the Report. I cannot remember precisely when or

      how I saw this Reply.


179. I accept that much of the Second Sight Report and of the Post Office Reply is

      outside my own area (such as it is) of expertise. I have no understanding of the

      Activation of Scratchcards, and I never mastered the details of Transaction

      Reversals. But when I did see the Reply, which I assumed from its tone had

      been drafted mainly by Chris Aujard, it struck me as unconvincing, defensive,

      offhand and designed to be obstructive.



180. The Reply said, for example, that "Matters such as the Subpostmaster contract

      and other legal matters are not within the scope of the Scheme and are outside

      Second Sight's professional expertise." (Paragraph 1.9). I had expressly said

      to the Post Office that Second Sight should have no no-go areas and believed

      that they had accepted that, so 1.9 was a breach of the understanding that MPs




155 [POL00002415].


                                       Page 95 of 193
                                                                                         WITN00020100




     had with them. And Second Sight's professional expertise was more than

     capable of dealing with contracts and legal matters. Accountants have to deal

     with law much as lawyers have to deal with accounts.



181. Another example was the Post Office's treatment of the contract with

     subpostmasters (paragraphs 4.1-4.16). My experience of dealing with Jo

     Hamilton was that she was a trustworthy, sensible woman dealing with an

     overbearing organisation that refused to listen to what she said. The Post

     Office Reply about the fairness of the contract, I thought, was callous and

     wrong, and bore out what I had heard from Jo Hamilton.



182. Another example was the Post Office's Reply about Training, Support and

     Supervision (Section 8). The complaints from the subpostmasters about the

     inadequacy of these things are dismissed as "based entirely on the anecdotal

     information provided by Applicants in their CQRs. As noted in the introduction

     to this Reply, that information remains largely untested." But what else could

     such a report be based on? Since the Post Office was insisting that Second

     Sight restrict itself to dealing with the applications to the mediation scheme

     rather than doing the investigations that such allegations cried out for, it came

     poorly from the Post Office to complain about the anecdotal nature of what

     Second Sight was finding.



183. Another example was the Post Office's arrogant dismissal of Second Sight's

     concerns expressed in Section 22 about the behaviour of Post Office

     investigators. It merely rejected the section as being outside the scope of


                                      Page 96 of 193
                                                                                       WITN00020100




      Second Sight's expertise. But when Second Sight had produced its Interim

      Report in July 2013, in my Press Release156 issued on the day of the release of

      that report I had included the following words:



                 "However, the problems investigators have discovered point to the

                need for further work. These problems involve:

                •      The way the Post Office has investigated concerns"



184. So my preference (referred to above) for Second Sight's view of events over

      that of the Post Office where their views differed encouraged me to reject the

      Post Office's Reply in those areas — virtually all - where they disagreed with

      Second Sight.



185. On 1st October 2014 Paula Vennells wrote to me157 in response to my letter to

      her of 17th September 2014 about Alan Bates' concerns about the Post Office

      being lawyered up as follows:



                 "Thank you for your letter of 17th September regarding the concerns

                Alan has expressed about how the Working Group meetings are

                proceeding and attendance at those meetings. For your information,

                Post Office General Counsel is the lead PO representative at the

                meeting and from time to time takes along members of his team who

                are involved in the case work, as do Second Sight.

               "As you note, the Working Group is independent, and it would be

               inappropriate for me to intervene as its proceedings, including who

               attends, are matters for the Group and the Chair. It is of course open

               to Alan to raise any concerns relating to Working Group meetings with

               the Chair."



       There is no record in my files as to what I did with this dismissive letter.

       Neither is there any record of a response from Sir Anthony Hooper, to whom I

       had copied my letter of 17th September 2014.



186. In view of rising concerns about the progress of the mediation scheme I believe

      that there were then several telephone calls and probably meetings between

      Alan Bates, Second Sight, other MPs and myself — though not necessarily

      together - to discuss how we should best take things forward. Journalists were

      beginning to get wind (though not through me) that things were not going well.



187. On 17th October 2014 I wrote158 to Paula Vennells as follows:



               "I would be pleased if you would accept a request to come to a meeting

               with myself, Oliver Letwin, Mike Wood, and Andrew Bridgen to discuss

               progress on the mediation process. I am not alone in becoming

                and I am beginning to fear its disintegration. I would like to discuss this

                 with you as soon as possible.



                 "The following times suit me. Might you be able to make one of them? I

                am very keen to meet as soon as possible.

                6pm Monday 17 November



                 "If none of these suit, please would your office call mine to discuss

                 times that might be available? I shall ask Janet to call your office next

                 week to check.



                 "Also, might you let me have an answer to my letter of 4 September

                2014 to you please about meeting with my colleague Jim Hood MP and

                myself? I did write to remind you about this a month ago but am yet to

                have a response."



        I was losing — had in fact lost — patience and trust.



188. Then things began to go bad quite quickly. On 22nd October 2014 Janet

      Walker wrote to Avene O'Farrell159 at the Post Office to say,

                "Last Friday fie 17th October 2014] James sent a letter to Paula

                requesting a meeting. Could you please give me a call at the earliest

                possible opportunity to arrange. I must let you know that we are now

                receiving calls from numerous journalists about the mediation scheme

                and so this meeting is a matter of considerable urgency"



189. On 23rd October 2014 Janet Walker emailed Ron Warmington16° to say that

      things were starting to speed up and she wondered whether he had yet heard

      from Paula. We were getting calls from journalists and I would have to say

      something soon. Ron Warmington replied:



                "Left a message today. Paula is out on holiday this week. They're

                going to see whether she can fit in a call with me some time next week

                (I). The Defence Team Representative (Belinda Crowe) wanted to

                know what I wanted to speak to Paula about (the weather maybe?). I

                gave her a broad outline but obviously I want to have a person-to-

                person quick call with Paula not to have some intermediary

                intercept/interpret/dilute/delay. Will persevere."

                 "I am becoming increasingly worried about how the sub-Postmasters

                mediation process is working. The Post Office is treating the decision

                as to whether individual cases should go through to mediation as a

                legal battlefield, to the extent that I am getting close to asking another

                Urgent Question in the House of Commons about it. I have requested

                a meeting with Paula, who I know is on leave this week. My office is

                receiving requests for me to talk to the media, and I intend to do so, but

                I want to discuss matters with Paula first, if possible. I, the

                subpostmasters and Second Sight agreed to this process in the

      Bates and me. He wanted to talk to me about "potential developments". I do

      not have a note of that conversation but it helped to inform me for the telephone

                know that Ron from Second Sight is trying to reach her. He would like

                 to tell her how things are going from his perspective and James is very

                keen for her to hear what he has to say."



192. On 28th October 2014 there was a telephone call between Paula Vennells and

      me. In setting it up with Avene O'Farrell Janet Walker said163,



                 "James is content to have a word but he would prefer to meet Paula

                face to face and wants other MPs to join him, namely Oliver Letwin,

                Andrew Bridgen, and Mike Wood. So, a preliminary and brief word

                 tomorrow would work well but he does want a meeting subsequently."



193. Janet Walker had prepared speaking notes164 for me, and I accept the accuracy

      of the Post Office notes165 of the conversation. In essence I told Paula Vennells

      that the mediation scheme was breaking down, that the Post Office was trying

      to prevent people from entering it, that JFSA were likely to take legal action

      before the end of the year and that I was minded to advise them to do so and

      that while I did not want to be seen as abandoning the process I felt I could not

      currently really support it.



194. Paula Vennells replied that the Post Office had invested a lot of time and

      money in the scheme and could not be accused of bad faith, that the Post

      Office could not accept responsibility for matters for which it was not

      responsible, that the mediation scheme was not a compensation scheme and

      that over 90 cases had now been investigated and no evidence had been

      identified which suggested there was a problem with Horizon.



195. I raised the case of Jo Hamilton, and was concerned she had been told the

      Post Office was not willing to consider the case until all other cases had been

      completed. It does not appear that this point received a reply from Paula

      Vennells at this stage.



196. On 4th November 2014 Janet Walker forwarded to Steve McCabe MP

      correspondence from the Post Office about his constituent.



197. On 5th November 2014 Paula Vennells wrote to me166 to repeat what she had

      said in our telephone conversation.



198. The meeting between the Post Office and MPs took place in my office in

      Portcullis House on Monday 17th November 2014 at 4:30pm. In the pre-

      meeting emails167 --Avene O'Farrell had said that Pauline Vennells had no

      objection to Alan Bates attending as well, so the attendees were Paula

      Vennells, Mark Davies, Chris Aujard and Angela Van Den Bogerd from the Post

      Office, Alan Bates from JFSA and Andrew Bridgen MP, Oliver Letwin MP, Mike

      Wood MP and myself. I held a pre-meeting with the MPs alone — and perhaps

      Alan Bates - at 4pm. Janet Walker had prepared speaking notes168 for the

      meeting.



199. What I remember of the meeting is that I felt that it was controlled, on the Post

      Office side, by Angela Van Den Bogerd and Chris Aujard. They said that the

      Post Office should exclude altogether from the mediation scheme people who

      had pleaded guilty — a different proposition from their being put to the back of

      the queue. I asked them how they thought I would have supported a scheme

      which excluded my constituent, Jo Hamilton, to which they had no answer.

      This, for me, was the final straw. Paula Vennells seemed almost cowed by their

      stronger personalities and said little. I told her she was breaking her word. I

      sensed, rightly or wrongly, that she felt ashamed. The meeting broke up in

      acrimony.



200. While I do not have notes of the meeting as such, my letter169 to interested

      MPs, which I probably sent on 20th November 2014 and which Janet Walker

      forwarded to the Post Office on 261" November 2014, sets out my view of how it

      had gone. In that letter I said:



                 "On Monday afternoon Oliver Letwin, Andrew Bridgen, Mike Wood and

                I met Paula Vennells, the CEO of Post Office Ltd, and some of her staff

                 to discuss progress of the mediation scheme. Also present at the

                meeting was Alan Bates of the Justice for Sub-Postmasters

Association. I think it would be fair to say that it was not an easy

meeting from anyone's point of view.



"The MPs expressed concerns about the Post Office's challenging too

many issues before cases even went to mediation, and we suggested

that where the independent investigators, Second Sight, recommended

that a case should go to mediation, there should be a presumption that

that would then happen.



"The Post Office said that they had done exactly what they had said

they would do, and that in challenging cases within the Working Party

they were doing what had always been set down as the process of the

Working Party (though this point was questioned by Alan Bates).



"In relation to our suggestion about a presumption in favour of Second

Sight's recommendation, Paula Vennells said she would consider it and

would take the matter to the Post Office Board. I believe we should

give her the opportunity to do that. The media are wanting to talk, but I

intend at the moment not myself to give interviews until the Post Office

has had a reasonable time — not open-ended - to consider it.



"I am sorry to relay this disappointing news, but I do believe that there

still is a chance to bring this very unhappy saga to a conclusion which

will not satisfy everybody but which will be better for most than before

we embarked on it.

                "On a different point, it does seem unlikely that resolution will have

                been reached by the General Election, at which, as you may know, I

                shall not be standing. I have (with the agreement of the MPs

                mentioned in this letter) discussed the matter with Kevan Jones, who

                would in due course be happy to take over from me the leadership of

                the matter. I am sure he will have your full support, as he will mine.



                "As soon as I have more news I will be in touch."



201. On 28th November 2014 Paula Vennells wrote to me170, having consulted the

      Post Office Board, rejecting my proposition that there should be a presumption

      in favour of Second Sight's recommendation as to who should go forward for

      mediation.



202. From 28th to 30th November 2014 I was in Istanbul for a British-Turkish

      conference, as was Alice Perkins. She and I spoke on the evening of 29th

      November 2014, and she reported our conversation to Paula Vennells in her

      email of 1st December 2014171. I accept the accuracy of her report. I would be

      surprised if this were the only Post Office report referring to the meeting of 17th

      November 2014, but it is the only one disclosed to me. It seems that I told Alice

      Perkins that I had had a sleepless night on receiving Paula Vennells' letter of

     28th November 2014. Alice Perkins says she was rather surprised at this. I

     took this matter as seriously then as I take it now.



203. She then asked me how I thought my colleagues had behaved at the meeting,

     and I said (correctly) that they had been much more restrained than I had

     expected. She said that it had not sounded very restrained to her, and it would

     be right to say that the MPs had been, and showed that we were, extremely

     angry.



204. She and I then apparently went through the arguments first rehearsed in the

     telephone conversation of 28th October 2014. It seems I said that the MPs

     wanted to meet Sir Anthony Hooper.



205. I told her that I thought that she and Paula Vennells genuinely believed what

     they were saying. Looking back on it now, I think I was wrong to believe that, at

     least as regards Paula Vennells, but I did believe it at the time — I thought at the

     time that much of the changed approach to the mediation scheme was down to

     Chris Aujard and Angela Van Den Bogerd.



206. Alice Perkins concluded that my position was exactly the same as it had been

     two and a half years previously. About that she was wrong. My position two

     and a half years previously had been that with hard work and good faith a

     public organisation like the Post Office could and would work with MPs to right

     wrongs for their constituents. But by the time of the conversation she was

     reporting I had lost trust in the Post Office. And I also found myself in full

      alignment with the forensic accountants that the Post Office themselves had

      appointed to investigate the matter.



207. On 1st December 2014 Paula Vennells forwarded Alice Perkins's report to

      Gavin Lambert172. I believe he was a civil servant at the Department of

      Business, Innovation and Skills. I do not know his role. In her email Paula

      Vennells said:


                "FYI.



                "To be discussed with the team if you can please Gavin, as Alice will

                undoubtedly want to cover off on Wed. Probably best to see below

                before you read on.



                "I hope AN decides to keep to his position of independence, I have

                suggested a couple of times in the past few months, to Belinda, that

                Alice might meet AH just in terms of keeping the relationship going, or

                even me (tho' I now think Chairman is better as is more removed from

                the process). Alice had requested to do so as well. But B was reticent

                (she thought it would raise the profile too much; I also think that she felt

                personally better in control if we didn't).

                "This may be the time — now. Or ... it may be too late and be seen as

                the PO trying to influence, which would be wrong. (Tho' if we find AH

                agrees to meet the MPs, we'd have to see him as well.)



                "All rather difficult. Sounds as though Alice did a good job though."



        I presume AH is Sir Anthony Hooper but I do not know who Belinda or B are. I

        see that there is a reference in an email from Ron Warmington of 23rd October

        2014173 to a Belinda Crowe whom Ron Warmington describes as "the Defence

        Team Representative" and perhaps 'B' might be Angela Van Den Bogard. But I

        do not know.


208. Whoever 'B' was, I note that the reason she (B) apparently gave for there being

      no meeting with AH was not that this might damage the integrity and

      independence of the scheme — the reason Paula Vennells implies that she

      herself would surely have given for his not meeting MPs - but that "she [B]

      thought it would raise the profile too much; I also think that she felt personally

      better in control if we didn't."



209. On 3rd December 2014 there was a meeting between Kevan Jones, Andrew

      Bridgen, Mike Wood and myself from the core group of MPs. I do not have a

      note of that meeting but what followed was presumably the outcome.

210. On 4th December 2014 I went to see the Speaker to ask for a debate in

      Westminster Hall. Thereafter, in an email contained in the diary entry for 17th

      December apparently dated 4th December 2014 but which must in reality have

      been dated 8th December, I wrote to Kevan Jones MP an email14 to say that

      the debate could be either in his, Kevan Jones's, name or mine and the

      Speaker did not seem to mind about that. And I wrote to Tim Robinson175 at the

      BBC as follows:



                "We need to talk. Specifically I shall be writing to Paula Vennells today,

                but releasing my letter to the press. In order to maximise its impact, I

                rather think my letter needs to be discussed on the Today Programme

                 tomorrow morning. But I'd like to discuss that with you before making

                any decisions, please."



        We probably did have such a conversation, but I did not go on the Today

        programme until 9th December 2014.



211. On 8th December 2014 I had a note in my diary entitled "Post Office letter

      actions" which read as follows:

"On 25th November I wrote to you to say that all was not well with the

Post Office Mediation Scheme. I am extremely sad to have to tell you

that since then things have taken a turn for the worse. The CEO of

Post Office Ltd, Paula Vennells, wrote to me to say that her Board had

considered but rejected the proposal that there should be a

presumption in favour of the recommendations made by Second Sight.

I have replied that in several different respects Post Office Ltd were

neither allowing the Mediation Scheme to proceed as it was designed

to nor doing what they said they would do. I attach hereto a copy of

the letter from Paula Vennells to me, a copy of my reply to her and of

the accompanying press release.



In the circumstances I have lost faith in the Post Office Board's

commitment to a fair resolution of the issue and have handed over the

leadership of the informal group of MPs to Kevan Jones with immediate

effect. I hope we shall shortly have an opportunity to discuss the issue

in an adjournment debate.



Many thanks for your encouraging support on this issue. I shall not

myself be abandoning the fight - merely carrying it on in other ways."'

212. And on the same day, 81" December 2014, I wrote a long letter176 to Paula

      Vennells setting out our position. The conclusions of that letter were as follows:



                "Conclusions



                "13   Despite the points raised in paragraph 5 above about

                investigations and contracts, the Post Office response of 22 September

                2014 states, among other things, that contracts and Post Office

                investigations are outside Second Sight's remit.



                "14   Despite your agreement that the Mediation Scheme was to be

                available to all SPMRs whose cases had been identified by Second

                Sight as giving rise to concern (see paragraph 6 above), in recent

                months the Post Office has been objecting to around 90% of cases

                going forward to mediation. This is contrary to the envisaged process

                whereby exclusion from mediation would be the exception (see

                paragraph 8 above), as well as being contrary to the entire purpose of

                the Mediation Scheme.



                "15   Despite your agreement to fund the engagement of professional

                advisers to support SPMRs "in all relevant stages of the process" (see

                paragraph 7), the Post Office is attempting, in the absence of

representation by those professional advisers of the SPMR under

consideration, to have 90% of cases excluded from mediation.



"16    Despite your agreement that those who had pleaded guilty

would be able to take advantage of the Mediation Scheme (see

paragraph 6 above), the Post Office has objected to cases going to

mediation on the ground that the SPMR had pleaded guilty.



"17    Despite your knowing that I and other MPs agreed to the

Mediation Scheme only on the basis that it would be available to those

who had pleaded guilty (see paragraph 6 above), you did not tell me,

nor so far as I am aware any other MP, that the Post Office was

arguing that a plea of guilty should debar the SPMR from mediation.



"18    Clearly the Post Office is aware of the Limitation Act point set

out in paragraph 13 above — it has enough lawyers. The Post Office

could allay any suspicion that this was a factor in the way that it has

been behaving by agreeing that Post Office Ltd will not take any time

barred limitation point in resisting legal claims arising out of the

introduction of Horizon and its support arrangements. Will you agree to

this? And will you agree not to destroy any data relevant to these

cases?



"19    Will you agree to MPs meeting Second Sight to discuss our

concerns and to hear their take on the matter?

                "20     I shall not be standing at the next General Election. It is clear

                that this will not have been resolved by then, and so the group of MPs

                who met you have agreed that Kevan Jones MP should take over my

                role in the group of MPs. This has been accepted without demur by the

                almost 150 other MPs who have constituents in this plight. In any event

                I could not continue negotiating with you because I have lost faith in the

                Post Office Board's commitment to a fair resolution of this issue. I shall

                be pursuing the need for justice for Sub Postmasters in other ways."



213. Also on December 8th 2014 I issued a Press Release177 the body of which read

      as follows:



                "MPs lose faith in Post Office mediation scheme



                "Today a group of MPs campaigning for justice for SubPostmasters

                announced that they have lost faith in the mediation scheme run by

                Post Office Ltd. James Arbuthnot, leader of the group of over 140 MPs,

                said:

"Following a meeting between the Chief Executive of Post Office Ltd,

Paula Vennells, and a small group of MPs to discuss the MPs'

concerns, the Chief Executive wrote a letter setting out the Post

Office's position. That letter and James Arbuthnot's reply are attached

hereto.



"Andrew Bridgen MP said:



      "MPs have been working with the Post Office for two years now

      in the belief that they would work towards a solution to this

"Mike Wood MP said:

        ADJOURNMENT DEBATE AND 2015 SELECT COMMITTEE



214. On the same day (8th December 2014) I wrote a letter178 to Adrian Bailey MP,

      Chair of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee. I said:



                 "Please may I put before you for consideration the possibility of your

                 Committee's doing an inquiry into the Mediation Scheme run by Post

                 Office Ltd in relation to the subpostmasters and the Horizon accounting

                system?



                It is a saga which has been running for years, but recent developments

                mean that I have decided that I should no longer lead the group of MPs

                 who have been campaigning to have some form of redress for the

                subpostmasters. I took this decision because I shall not be standing at

                 the next election, but it has been brought forward by some months by

                my loss of faith in the Post Office Board's commitment to a fair result. It

                 would not be overstating it to say that I believe the Post Office is doing

                its best to sabotage its own Mediation Scheme. / attach two letters, one

                from the CEO of the Post Office to me, and my reply to her, which give

                you an idea of the issues involved. My place will be taken by Kevan

                Jones, to whom I am copying this letter.



                I appreciate that this is not brilliant timing for your committee. But a

                subpostmaster who is having a house repossessed, or who is in

                 danger of losing the right to sue the Post Office through lapse of time,

                 cannot worry about our election timetable."



215. That evening in the division lobby I spoke to Adrian Bailey in the Central Lobby

      to reinforce my letter. He seemed to like my proposal and told me he would

      discuss it with his committee.



216. The following morning, 9th December 2014, I and others did media interviews

      to follow up the press release. I did the Today Programme with John

      Humphreys179, Radio 5 Live at 10:45180, and BBC Surrey at 5:15pm.



217. I also wrote to Jimmy Hood MP181 to explain what had happened to his

      correspondence. I said:



                 "Further to our conversation today I am writing to let you know that I

                 sent a letter to Paula Vennells, CEO, Post Office Ltd (copied in) in

                 September 2014, and followed it up in October 2014 asking when I

                 should be expectng a reply.



                 In a telephone call in November, Paula Vennells said she was very

                 sony [sic] for the delay andexplained [sic] that it had somehow slipped

                 through the net. She assured me that this matter was now in hand and

                 that a reply would be forthcoming shortly. it is now December and still

                 we have heard nothing.



                As lam standing down from the leadership of the group of MPs

                 campaigning to have some form of redress for the Subpostmasters, it

                is clear that I am no longer the person to try to persuade the Post

                 Office to respond.



                     am extremely sorry to let you down - I really hate doing this but in

                 view of the circumstances, can only hope that you understand my

                predicament."



218. I was granted the Adjournment Debate for which I had asked, and on the

      evening of 9th December 2014 I wrote to all MPs182 and said:



                 "Dear Colleague,



                 "At 2:30pm on Wednesday 17th December (next week) there will be a

                90 minute Adjournment Debate in Westminster Hall on the Post Office

                Mediation Scheme. The background to this, as contained in the

                attached letters and Press Release, is as follows.



                 "A decade or so ago the Post Office introduced a new computer

                accounting system, Horizon, for its sub Post Offices. Shortly thereafter

subPostmasters began to find discrepancies appearing in their

accounts (which they were required to balance at the end of each day

in order to trade the following day). Eventually these discrepancies led

to subPostmasters being prosecuted by the Post Office for false

accounting and theft, some of them going to prison. If you would like to

listen to accounts of how this happened, they are to be found on Radio

5 Live at http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b04tcfw6 , about 1 hour 10

minutes from the start, and on the Today Programme,

httpl/www.bbc.co.uk/radio/plaver/b04fidlq , about 1 hour and 32

minutes from the start.



"Growing concern was felt about the dependability of the Horizon

system, and MPs approached the Post Office asking for a resolution of

these concerns. Following an independent interim report by forensic

accountants Second Sight the Post Office set up a Mediation Scheme

to deal with those cases which have given rise to concern.



"In recent months MPs have discovered that the Post Office was using

the procedures of that Mediation Scheme to argue that most of the

cases giving rise to concern should not, despite what was agreed with

MPs, be permitted to go through mediation. This was done without the

Post Office's telling MPs they were doing it. I therefore have written to

the Post Office to say that I no longer have faith in the Post Office

Board's commitment to a fair resolution of this issue.

                "If you felt able to take part in the Adjournment Debate, I and the other

                MPs who have been pursuing this matter would be most appreciative."



219. I see that the Post Office held a Drop-in Session in the House of Commons on

      10th December 2014183. I believe I did not go.



220. On Monday 15th December 2014 there is an item184 in my diary entitled

      "Postponed — phone call with Simon Blagden, Fujitsu". It seems that I had tried

      to telephone him — and it can only have been about Horizon since I was no

      longer Chairman of the Defence Select Committee. Mr Blagden had gone

      overseas.



221. On 17th December 2014 the Adjournment Debate took place185, from 2:30pm to

      4:00pm, with the Minister Jo Swinson answering on behalf of the Government.

      The House of Commons Library had issued briefing for the debate which

      despite its being the day before the Christmas Recess was very well attended

      both by MPs and subpostmasters.



222. There is no need for me to rehearse here the speeches made but I shall pick

      out two matters. First, Andrew Bridgen MP raised the extraordinary case of

      Michael Rudkin and remote access — followed by an investigator's visit to his

      post office the following day, about which there had been simmering suspicion

      for well over a year. And second, Kevan Jones MP said to the Minister, "You're

      the Minister, do something" to which the Minister in replying said, "In order to do

      something, what is required is independent investigation that is done thoroughly

      and forensically". She seemed to be unaware that the independent

      investigation done by Second Sight had just been rejected by the Post Office.



223. The following day, on 18th December 2014, I did an interview with BBC Radio

      Shropshire.



224. By January 2015 I had a list of 123 MPs representing 144 subpostmaster

      applicants within the mediation scheme and 19 other MPs with subpostmasters

      outside the scheme.


225. On 12th January 2015 I wrote a letter to the CCRC186, in which I said,



                 "Could I ask for your help please, over a matter I have been pursuing

                for a number of years? This concerns the Post Office and the

                 convictions, sometimes after pleas of guilty, of sub-postmasters and

                sub-postmistresses for offences usually of false accounting, but also (I

                understand) theft and fraud. The accused tended to blame the Post

                 Office's Horizon computer system for the money that had gone

                missing.



                 "After discussion with many concerned Members of Parliament, the

                Post Office set up a scheme to consider these cases, with the

availability of independent mediation if agreement between those

accused and the Post Office could not be reached. I was hopeful that

justice might be achieved via this scheme, but have now given up as

the Post Office is doing everything in its powers to stop cases

proceeding to any mediation at all. I am extremely disappointed that

this is the result of much hard work and negotiation by myself and over

140 other MPs.



"The result of this is that there is a strong likelihood that miscarriages of

justice have occurred but that those who have suffered from them will

now have no means for redress of their conviction via the Post Office's

mediation scheme. Whilst we understand that some of these

individuals may be guilty we cannot believe that all are and we would

very much like to see what we can do to help our constituents, many of

whose lives, finances, and reputations have been utterly ruined.

"Are you able to offer me any thoughts as to whether or not the CCRB

[sic] would look into these cases please? I do not know the procedure

of bringing this to the Board's attention, and so thought it best to begin

with a direct approach to you.

                "I should be most grateful for your consideration of this matter."



226. On 13th January 2015 I wrote to Paula Vennells187 asking for a reply to my letter

      of 8th December 2014. On 14 th January 2015 Mark Davies said188 he had been

      asked to reply to my letter of 8th December 2014189. He offered me a meeting

      to talk about Jo Hamilton. He said he enclosed a fact sheet, but that is not with

      the papers disclosed to me and I may not have retained it.



227. The CCRC's reply to me of 14th January 2015190 said that they had been in

      contact with the Post Office for some time seeking information and clarification

      on a number of points, and that they had the power under s.17 of the Criminal

      Appeals Act 1995 to require public bodies to preserve and make available to

      them documentation, and that they had made a s.17 request to the Post Office.



228. On 22nd January 2015 I wrote again to Paula Vennells191 to say:



                "Please would you offer me an answer to the questions I posed in my

                letter to you of 8 December 2014? These are:

                 "2.   Will you agree not to take any time barred limitation point in

                resisting legal claims arising out of the introduction of Horizon and its

                support arrangements?



                 "3.   Will you agree to MPs meeting Second Sight to discuss our

                 concerns and to hear their take on the matter?



                 "Whilst you may prefer an answer to come from either one of your

                lawyers or your public affairs spokesman might you do me the courtesy

                of responding to this yourself, please?"



229. At some stage the BIS Select Committee decided to hold an inquiry on Tuesday

      3rd February 2015 into the Post Office Mediation Scheme, because on 21s1

      January 2015 Karl Flinders of Computer Weekly emailed192 Janet Walker to

      say:



                 "Great news about the inquiry. I have written a story this morning about

                it but I am interested in doing a more in depth follow-up about what this

                 could mean.



                 "It seems that there are more and more people supporting the

                subpostmasters' cause, which is great.

                "If James can call me onl        GRO         later for a chat that would be

                good. No hurry as the news is done. This will be more on an analysis."



230. I do not know when I spoke to Karl Flinders nor what article came of it, but I

      would have spoken to him and he would have written an article.



231. On 28th January 2015 I wrote to Adrian Bailey MP193, the Chair of the Select

      Committee, to send him some of the evidence he might find useful.



232. On 29th January 2015 I spoke to Ian Henderson of Second Sight; he wanted

      tips on how to give evidence to the committee; he had been told it seems that

      his evidence might last only 45 minutes.



233. On 2nd February 2015 Janet Walker (and this would have been after

      discussion with me) wrote to Alan Bates and Kay Linne11194 (copied to Ron

      Warmington) about their evidence, making the following suggestions about

      what they should ask the Select Committee to recommend:



                "1.       Initiate inquiry independent of Post Office — perhaps a public

234. I went to the hearing of the Select Committee on 3rd February 2015195 to sit in

      the public gallery. I shall confine myself to picking up one or two matters from

      the hearing.



235. At Questions 73 and 74 Ian Henderson was asked whether he asked for the

      emails from 2008 and was given those from 2009 instead. He said,



                "... we were provided with 2009. We were told at the time that with the

                first batch there were some technology issues relating to the provision

                of the 2008 e-mails. Two years down the line, we still don't have

                those."



236. In answer to Question 76, Ian Henderson said,



                "we unsurprisingly asked for full access to those legal files. Responses

                were to the effect, "Under no circumstances are we going to give you

                access to those files. You are entitled to the public documents that

                would normally be available to the defendant if the case had gone to

                trial."



237. Although Angela Van Den Bogerd tried to dispute both points (saying in answer

      to Question 81, "I do not recall that conversation"), this was another example of

     my preferring Second Sight's version of events to that of the Post Office. But

     then in answer to Question 112 Ian Henderson clarified things as follows:



             "Chairman, may I add something by way of clarification? It is the

             general counsel of Post Office [Chris Aujard], to whom I have spoken,

             who said that he is not prepared to disclose to us the full legal files. I do

             not know to what extent he gave the same answer and advice to the

             chief executive of the Post Office."



238. In answer to Question 147 Paula Vennells said:



             "If there had been any miscarriages ofjustice, it would have been really

             important to me and the Post Office that we surfaced those. As the

             investigations have gone through, so far we have no evidence of that."



239. As set out above I had formed a different opinion from hers, and thought she

     was probably simply wrong and blinding herself to the Second Sight evidence

     that I thought was so compelling. I did not dismiss entirely the thought that she

     might be lying, but lying to Parliament is a big step. At the time I was listening

     to her saying it, I was unaware of the Clarke Advice of 15th July 2013 and of the

     considerations, investigations and discussions that must have gone into its

     commissioning and the fallout after its receipt. If I had been aware of the

     existence of the Clarke Advice I would have thought she was lying, because it

     would have been inconceivable to me that so important a matter would have

     been kept from the CEO. If she had not been aware of it, it could only in my

         view be because she had decided, despite all the concerns raised directly with

        her over a period of years about possible miscarriages of justice, deliberately to

        remain in ignorance of what was going on in the organisation of which she was

        CEO.



240. On 11th February 2015 I had a telephone call with Alan Bates. There are no

        notes in my diary entry about it, but that may have been the date on which he

         told me he was pressing ahead with group litigation.



241. On 11th February 2015 I spoke to Sir Alan Beith MP, the Chair of the Justice

        Select Committee, and on the following day wrote to him196 as follows:



                  "We spoke briefly last night on a matter in connection with the

                  Committee's current inquiry into the Criminal Cases Review

                  Commission. My interest is with regard to cases connected with the

                  Post Office where an individual has pleaded guilty to a charge and the

                  case later turns out to be a miscarriage of justice. I have corresponded

                  with the Chair, Richard Foster, about this and attach a copy of his

                  response to me.



                  "We discussed whether the CCRC might review such a case. You said

                  that your understanding was that it was possible but only if the Appeals

                  Court was prepared to accept the argument that a miscarriage of

                justice had in fact occurred. My question is: how would such a case get

                 to the Appeals Court unless it had first been reviewed by the CCRC?



                 "Second, we discussed the lack of clarity surrounding whether or not

                 the CCRC can deal with private prosecutions. It would be good to see

                 what the Inquiry findings are on this."



242. On 12th February 2015 I wrote to Daniel Kawczynski MP197 as follows:



                 "Thank you for your letter of 9 February regarding your constituent and

                involvement in the Post Office Horizon issues. You ask a very pertinent

                question - how to maintain a coordinated approach to this very thorny

                problem. As I am standing down at the next election Kevan Jones MP

                has kindly offered to lead on this and so your office ought to get in

                 touch with his office and register your interest.



                 "I have lost faith with the Mediation Scheme and indeed the Post Office

                 who seem to me to be running in almost exactly the opposite direction

                 to that intended at the outset of this process. My own constituent

                remains in the Scheme - which in her case has ground to a shuddering

                halt - but she is in close contact with the Justice for SubPostmasters

                Alliance run by the splendid Alan Bates, and I could think of no better

                place to send your constituent than there: http://www.jfsa.org.uk/. I

                understand that they are considering a class action lawsuit.

                 "If I think of anything else I will let you know but I hope you will continue

                 to campaign on behalf of your constituent. The Post Office has acted

                abominably and seems not to comprehend this in the slightest."



243. On 18th February 2015 I went to see Kay Linnell and Jo Hamilton — both being

      my constituents.



244. It seems that on 19th February 2015 Ian Henderson wrote a confidential

      memo198 to the BIS Select Committee (I don't know how or exactly when I got

      hold of this memo, whether from Second Sight or one of the members of the

      Select Committee or otherwise, but I remember seeing it shortly after its receipt

      by the Select Committee). That note said, amongst other things:



                 "2.1. In my evidence to the Committee I referred to the need for

                Second Sight to have access to the complete, i.e. not redacted, legal

                files held by Post Office. Ms. Vennells also referred to Post Office's

                 commitment to identifying "Miscarriages of Justice".



                 "2.2. However, Post Office's true position on this point was set out in a

                letter from Post Office to Second Sight, dated 21 January 2015:



                        "Post Office does not accept that an analysis of the evidence in

                        the Applicant's criminal case, whether served during the course

                                                                           WITN00020100




        of that case or not, is either within the scope of the mediation

        scheme or something which is within Second Sight's remit."



2.3. It would appear that concern about Second Sight investigating

previous prosecutions by Post Office, is the real reason behind Post

Office's continuing refusal to provide us with access to the complete

legal files.



2.4. When Second Sight was first appointed by Post Office and

Members of Parliament in July 2012, a number of undertakings were

given by Post Office in order to satisfy MPs that Second Sight would be

able to conduct a truly independent investigation into the matters of

concern.



2.5. Those undertakings included the following:



        • Unrestricted access to documents held by Post Office

        (including documents subject to confidentiality and legal

        professional privilege);

        • No limitation in the scope of work determined necessary by

        Second Sight.



2.6. Those undertakings were reflected in the "Raising Concerns with

Horizon" document signed by Post Office on 17 Dec 2012 and sent to

the JFSA and Mediation Scheme Applicants. A key paragraph was:


                         Page 133 of 193
                                                                                          WITN00020100




                       "In order to carry out the Inquiry, Second Sight will be entitled to

                       request information related to a concern from Post Office

                       Limited, and if Post Office Limited holds that information, Post

                       Office Limited will provide it to Second Sight."



                2.8. It would appear that many Subpostmasters and Applicants to the

                Mediation Scheme will have relied on that paragraph, when reporting

                matters to Second Sight. Post Office is clearly no longer meeting its

                commitment to provide Second Sight with the documents requested."



245. In relation to one of the rare cases where Second Sight was given access to

      the full file (and I believe it was Jo Hamilton's), the memo said in its conclusion,



                "4.1. The new facts that have come to light as a result of examining a

                single complete legal file, have identified a number of issues that

                indicate:

                a) Possible misconduct by a Prosecutor on behalf of Post Office; and

                b) A possible miscarriage ofjustice."



246. On 24th February 2015 Paula Vennells wrote to me199 in reply to my letters of

      8th December 2014 and 13th and 22nd January 2015. She refused my request

      not to rely on the Statute of Limitations. This contributed to an impression I had

      that one of her motivations was to string the subpostmasters and MPs along

      until the subpostmasters were time-barred. She said (without mentioning the

      Post Office's general policies on retention of documents),



                 "Post Office has gone to great lengths to trace information relating to

                cases in the Scheme, even those that are very old and we have no

                plans to destroy that information, all of which is being provided to

                Second Sight and applicants as part of the process of the Scheme.



                 "You asked if I would agree to Second Sight meeting with MPs. I am

                content for Post Office to organise a briefing on the Scheme for MPs,

                perhaps via the All Party Parliamentary Post Office Group, that Second

                Sight could attend. I have asked my team to pick this up."



        She did not say that in under a month she would be sacking Second Sight.



247. On 4th March 2015 Kevan Jones MP and I held a meeting in my office in the

      House of Commons with Richard Foster of the Criminal Cases Review

      Commission. On 5th March 2015 I wrote to Richard Foster20° as follows:



                 "Thank you very much for coming to London yesterday for our meeting.

                Both Kevan Jones and I came away from it feeling encouraged. As I

                mentioned, the SubPostmasters we both know are not criminals, are

                finding that the mediation Scheme currently run by the Post Office is

                offering them no redress and they are at a loss as to where to go next.

You have given us a most valuable suggestion as to what they ought to

do next.



"I may not have mentioned to you and Sally but there are over 140

MPs who have at least one constituent involved in the Mediation

Scheme. There are plenty more individuals who could not apply within

the timescale allowed to join the Scheme so this should give you some

idea of the scale of the problem. There have been bankruptcies and

family breakdowns, of course, but there have also been suicides. Some

of the stories we hear are utterly ghastly.



"I have asked Alan Bates, an extremely good man who runs the Justice

for SubPostmasters Alliance (JFSA), to prompt those affected to apply

to the CCRC to have their cases investigated. I hope many do apply.

My own constituent, Jo Hamilton, most certainly will.



"As to the favour you asked in return, within the next week I shall be

sending an update on the matter to all 140+ colleagues here at the

House of Commons and I shall ask them to look on your request to

make Section 17 applicable to private bodies with favour. You might

care to talk to Kevan Jones about this after the election, if he is

returned. I hope we can deliver this for you."

248. On 9th March 2015 Richard Foster wrote me a long and helpful letter201 about

      the powers of the CCRC, and told me that they would be setting up a dedicated

      unit to handle the Post Office cases.



249. On 10th March 2015 I heard via a Post Office Press Release202 that the Post

      Office had sacked Second Sight and disbanded Sir Anthony Hooper's

      independent Working Group. I thought there was a strong risk that the Post

      Office would try to suppress Second Sight's updated Briefing Report Part 2, so I

      immediately wrote a letter203 to Paula Vennells making a Freedom of

      Information request for the updated report. The Post Office sent me a holding

      reply204 the following day.



250. And on 11th March 2015 I emailed MPs205 quoting the Post Office's Press

      Release and saying,



                "The independent investigators, Second Sight, have now been put on

                30 days' notice. They have been denied the documents they consider

                they need to determine whether a miscarriage ofjustice has taken

                place. As I understand it, this action by the Post Office denies to MPs

                the possibility of seeing Second Sight's Part 2 Report, which is now to

                be restricted to Post Office eyes only.

              "The Working Group is to be closed, presumably with immediate effect.

              The Post Office has said in their Press Releease, of which I attach a

              copy, "Nothing has been found in any of the cases to suggest Horizon

              has not worked as it should." While I do not accept that to be true, the

              refusal to give Second Sight access to the documents they considered

              they needed has made it impossible to satisfy our constituents that

              potential miscarriages ofjustice have been or will be put right. ...



              "I hope to have an early opportunity to bring this deeply worrying matter

              to the attention of the House, and should be grateful for your support."



251. In one sense it did not matter, to me or to anybody else, that Second Sight's

     role had been terminated. Their work had been so confined, restricted and

     frustrated by the Post Office that they were hardly able to continue to perform

     any useful role. They were being denied sight of the documents they needed in

     order to establish whether the Horizon IT and all the processes that went with it

     had any integrity. They were not being permitted to do the job that the Post

     Office had employed them to do, so in that sense there was no point in their

     struggling on.



252. This meant that the truth (or lack of it) of the evidence leading to convictions or

     pleas of guilty could not be tested. The mediation scheme had failed at the first

     step. Subsequent steps — including determining whether there had been

     miscarriages of justice, and if so what should flow from that in terms of




                                      Page 138 of 193

     compensation or overturning convictions or holding to account those who had

     been responsible for miscarriages of justice — never arose.



253. But in another sense I was infuriated, though not surprised. The Post Office

     had comprehensively abandoned its commitment to get to the bottom of the

     complaints as first agreed with me and Oliver Letwin in the meeting of 17th May

     2012. I believed, and still believe, that the reason the Post Office acted in such

     a way was because Second Sight were doing too good a job, that they were

     bringing to light failings in an accounting and auditing system, and the

     investigation and support services that went with it, in a way that amounted to

     an existential threat not only to Horizon but to the Post Office itself. Second

     Sight saw one legal folder — that of Jo Hamilton — and identified a case of

     misconduct in a public office. Although they may have seen a few others, my

     understanding (right or wrong, but Second Sight will be able to answer that) is

     that the result of their identifying the misconduct in Jo Hamilton's case was that

     thereafter they saw no more. The desire to cover it all up was more important

     to the Post Office than the requirements of truth, fairness and justice for the

     individual subpostmasters. I did believe then that justice would eventually be

     done, and I still believe that now, but I believed it would take much longer and

     would cost much more than needed. It has.



254. In that sense, therefore, the Post Office's sabotaging of its own mediation

     scheme, culminating in its sacking of Second Sight, was one of many tragically

     missed opportunities. But there were more to come.

255. Also on 11th March 2015 I asked a question2°6 in Prime Minister's Questions as

      follows:



                 "Is my right hon. Friend aware that in connection with the Post Office

                 mediation scheme, the Post Office has just sacked the independent

                 investigator, Second Sight, and told it to destroy all its papers? Does he

                 agree that it is essential that Second Sight's second report should not

                 be suppressed, but should be supplied to sub-postmasters and MPs,

                 starting with the hon. Member for West Bromwich West (Mr Bailey) and

                 the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee?"



256. The Prime Minister replied:



                 "My right hon. Friend makes an important point. I know that he has

                 consistently raised the concerns of some sub-postmasters about the

                 operation of the Post Office IT system and the matter of the Post Office

                 mediation scheme. The Business Committee is currently taking

                 evidence on this issue, and it should be given all the relevant

                 information. The Government should not interfere with the independent

                 mediation process, but I will ask the Business Secretary to write to my

                 right hon. Friend about his concern and to ensure that the Business

                 Committee can do its job properly."

257. So I wrote a letter207 dated 11th March 2015 to the Secretary of State saying,



                "In Prime Mister's Questions today the Prime Minister told me that he

                would ask you to write to me about the Post Office Mediation Scheme.

                While there are many things that are very worrying about it, what

                particularly concerns me is that the Post Office has recently been

                refusing to give to Second Sight the documents and information that

                Second Sight feel they need in order to determine whether a

                miscarriage of justice has occurred. I believe that the only legal folder,

                for example, that Second Sight has seen is that relating to my

                constituent Jo Hamilton - but that folder did show that there was no

                evidence (as the Post Office knew at the time) of theft. Yet the Post

                Office charged her with theft. And as a result she then pleaded guilty

                to false accounting, having untruthfully been told that she was the only

                person going through these difficulties.



                "That suggests to me that there is more disclosure of documents that

                need to take place, and that our constituents will never believe that the

                truth has been reached without that disclosure. Equally, that disclosure

                needs to be made to Second Sight, who have now built up the

                expertise to deal with it."



258. On 12th March 2015 I wrote208 again to Richard Foster at the CCRC and said:

"When we met on 4 March you said that the CCRC would welcome

applications from SubPostmasters who had been found guilty or who

had pleaded guilty to a criminal conviction. I now enclose an

application from my constituent, Jo Hamilton, whom I mentioned to you

and Sally when we met.



"The reason for my approaching you directly is that I am concerned

that the Post Office are about to begin destroying documents pertinent

not just to Jo's case but to all the others that come under the same

rubrick. I wonder if there is anything the CCRC can do to forestall this?



"With no notice given, on Tuesday 10 March 2015 the Post Office

closed the mediation scheme that was set up with the express purpose

of offering individuals like Jo some kind of redress. The independent

investigators, Second Sight, who were appointed by the Post Office,

have been put on 30 days' notice on Tuesday which was not

coincidentally, I suspect, the day before they were due to issue their

final report (formally called the Second Sight Briefing Report — Part 2)

into all cases they investigated to the working group administering the

mediation scheme. This of course means that the report will only be

seen by Post Office. I have requested a copy under Freedom of

Information but fully expect to receive a negative response. I have

asked the Prime Minister at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of

Commons this week to ensure the Report is made available to the BIS

Select Committee who conducted a formal inquiry into the mediation

scheme very recently. Would it be helpful for the CCRC to request a

copy of this report, under your own investigative powers, I wonder? It

would certainly be pertinent to any future investigations your

Commission might wish to undertake.



"The investigators have also been told that they must destroy all

relevant communications and return all relevant documents to the Post

Office, on 17 April 2015. My fear is that this signals the beginning of

relevant documents disappearing. Is there any action the CCRC can

take to stop this happening?



"You will read from the enclosed Briefing Note to BIS Select

Committee, which is from Ian Henderson of Second Sight, the

difficulties he and his team have faced in gaining access to documents

they deem indispensable for thorough investigation to occur. Now Post

Office has rescinded Second Sight's permission to speak to me and all

other MPs, thus our avenues for discovering the facts about our

constituents' cases and therefore helping them are now closed.



"If there is anything the Commission can do at this stage to stop the

destruction of potentially relevant documents and to gain access to the

Second Sight Part 2 Report, I would be most grateful."

259. On 17th March 2015 the Secretary of State, Vince Cable, wrote209 to me in

      response to my letter of 11th March 2015210. In essence he reiterates "that the

      mediation scheme is independent of Government", goes on to put the Post

      Office's case and says, "The Government is not privy to information about this

      [the business of the Working Group]". To all intents and purposes his letter was

      pointless.



260. Also on 17th March 2015 I had a telephone conversation with Oliver Letwin

      about the Post Office at his request, but I do not know what was said in that

      conversation.



261. On 18th March 2015 I wrote to Paula Vennells211 rejecting Mark Davies's offer

      of a meeting to talk about Jo Hamilton. I seemed to be unaware in writing that

      letter of Paula Vennells' letter212 of 24th February 2015.



262. On 24th March 2015, the CCRC wrote to me 213 to say that they were in active

      discussion with the Post Office over Jo Hamilton and the retention of the

      relevant documents, and on 25th March 2015 I wrote214 to the CCRC (probably

      not by then having received their letter of 24th March 2015) enclosing a copy of

      Second Sight's briefing note to the BIS Committee drafted in advance of Ian

      Henderson's appearance before the Committee on 3rd February 2015. It is not

      clear to me which briefing note this was.

263. On 26th March 2015 Paula Vennells wrote to me215 in reply to my letter of 18th

      March 2015216, and she correctly pointed out to me her earlier response of 24th

      February 2015217. She confirmed that the Post Office would not destroy

      documents relating to Jo Hamilton.

        FOLLOWING THE SCHEME



264. On 30th March 2015 Parliament was dissolved and I stopped being an MP.



265. On 9th April 2015 there is a note218 in my diary — probably written by Janet

      Walker - about my Freedom of Information Request to see Second Sight's Final

      Report. The note states that the response was due on that day, and:



                 "If Post Office refuse to send you copy of the Second Sight Part 2

                Report, you need to write back to the post Office asking them to state

                reasons why they have refused. Once you receive this, if you disagree

                or wish to challenge their decision, you need to follow instructions on

                 the Information Commissioner's website. https://ico.om.ukifor-the-

                public/official-informationi



        On 10th April 2015219 the Post Office replied to my Freedom of Information

        Request saying that the Report was exempt from disclosure (not something

        which I remember accepting) but that they would send it to me on a

        discretionary basis.



266. I do not know exactly when I therefore received the Second Sight updated

      report dated 9th April 2015220 but I should think it was shortly after it was

     produced. In that document Second Sight set out that they had experienced

     significant difficulty in obtaining access to a number of documents that they

     believed were necessary for the purposes of their investigation, notwithstanding

     Post Office's commitment to make requested documents available to them.



267. They set out (in paragraphs 2.9-2.13) part of the Michael Rudkin story and state

     that they believed that Fujitsu / Post Office did have, and might still have, the

     ability to directly alter branch records without the knowledge of the relevant

     Subpostmaster, an allegation which the Post Office was at the time denying.

     They set out a number of other issues including (paragraph 4.10) that Post

     Office did not appear — at least for a time - to operate a "litigation hold" process

     whereby documents that might later be needed to support a complaint or

     investigation would be retained — and so, on and on. The updated report was

     more damning even than the Part 2 Report of the previous year. Its

     conclusions cast doubt (to put it at its most favourable to the Post Office) on the

     Post Office's commitment to seek the truth. Second Sight were unable to

     complete their independent investigation in the way they considered necessary

     but they were able to say that "we remain concerned that in some

     circumstances Horizon can be systemically flawed from a user's perspective

     and Post Office has not necessarily provided an appropriate level of support."



268. At this stage I was out of Parliament, and so far as I was concerned my political

     efforts had now to be subsumed to the legal case that Alan Bates was trying to

     get off the ground, but I had not given up my own part in the fight.

269. I have in my files an email sent to me by Ron Warmington of 28th July 2015221

      in which he is trying to get through both to George Freeman MP and to the then

      Prime Minister, David Cameron MP, the inaccuracy of their summary of the

      Second Sight reports. He says in the email to George Freeman,



                 "even if there had never been any systemic flaws in either version of

                 the system (that being a contention with which we do not agree), that

                 would not mean that the operational platform as a whole was always fit

                for purpose for all of the tens of thousands of users. As we have stated

                in our Report, it was not."



        I considered he was right about both the flaws in the system and about the

        inaccurate portrayal of the Second Sight reports. I probably left to the

        continuing MPs the task of ensuring that George Freeman and the Prime

        Minister took the points on board.



270. On 4th August 2015 the office of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for

      Intellectual Property, Baroness Neville-Rolfe wrote to me222 at the request of

      Andrew Bridgen MP to set up a meeting to talk about the Post Office, and it

      was agreed that it should take place on 17th September 2015.

271. On 17th August 2015 the Panorama programme, "Trouble at the Post Office",

      was aired. I was interviewed, and said that Jo Hamilton's conviction needed to

      be overturned despite her plea of guilty and Paula Vennells should go.



272. In the Dissolution Honours List issued on 27th August 2015 it was announced

      that I would become a Life Peer.



273. I have in my papers a copy of a letter dated 10th September 2015223 from

      Baroness Neville-Rolfe, to the incoming Chairman of the Post Office, Tim

      Parker. I do not know how that letter came to me, but I may have downloaded

      it from the internet. In that letter she says,



                 "I am writing to you ahead of your taking up the role of Post Office

                Limited Chairman to confirm our conversation last month regarding the

                Post Office Horizon system. The issues surrounding the Horizon IT

                system have not been resolved. Indeed, some of the MPs concerned

                have written to me again following the Panorama programme pressing

                 the case for an independent investigation."



274. On 16th September 2015 Alan Bates emailed me224 to ask about Tim Parker

      and also to keep me up to speed about how things were going from his point of

      view.

275. I think it was in the hope, arising out of Andrew Bridgen's request and the

      Panorama programme, of keeping the issue alive with the incoming

      Government that I went to see Baroness Neville-Rolfe, on 17th September

      2015. Janet Walker (even though she was now working for someone else) had

      made a few suggestions225 as to what I should raise, including:



                 "Give her hell!

                 Worth telling her that Post Office is dragging its heels in getting

                documents to the CCRC in Jo's case.

                 Would she be willing to see Ian Henderson, do you think?

                Journalists still interested — campaigners still v active — won't go away.

                 Worth saying that in the end, the entire matter will need to be sorted

                and the longer it is left, the more expensive to the Government (money

                and reputation) it will be."



        I cannot remember much about the meeting except that I talked Baroness

        Neville-Rolfe through the saga and asked her to see what she could do to

        help. I think her reaction was positive. On 13th October 2015 she wrote to

        me 226 to say that she would, as I had asked, meet Second Sight.



276. In my files there is a briefing note which I believe Ron Warmington sent me on

      19th October 2015227. I cannot remember whether this was because he was

      meeting Baroness Neville-Rolfe and knew I would be interested, or whether it

new role and we thought it would be helpful to compare notes.

        THE SWIFT REVIEW



277. On 10th December 2015 I had a meeting in my office in Gray's Inn with Tim

      Parker and Jonathan Swift QC at Tim Parker's request. I accept the accuracy

      of their notes225. I took the meeting as an opportunity to revisit an issue that the

      Post Office had been very keen to bury. I cannot remember being particularly

      optimistic about the outcome — I had had too many dealings with the Post

      Office to believe that a new person in the chair would be likely to change the

      culture of an organisation that was so deeply defensive and unwilling to hear or

      act upon the truth.



278. I do not remember hearing back from Tim Parker or Jonathan Swift. Apart from

      the meeting on 10th December 2015 I was not involved in the Swift Review229. I

      believe I first became aware of its existence on or around 11th August 2022

      when Eleanor Shaikh's Freedom of Information request bore fruit, when I was

      able to obtain a copy from the internet - and as far as I remember I read about it

      on Nick Wallis's blog or in Karl Flinders' Computer Weekly article.



279. It is hard to say what steps I would have taken in response to the Swift Review,

      since I would have given the Review entirely different terms of reference — I

      would not have started from here. On the assumption, which we now know to

      be true, that Gareth Jenkins had told Ian Henderson on 13th September 2012

that remote access was a given, and also that the Post Office had in 2013

informed its insurers that there might be miscarriages of justice, there would

have needed to have been serious and immediate action. It should have

started with a clear out of that part of the management and legal team that had

been covering it all up and lying about it. There would then have needed to be

open disclosure of the lack of safety of most if not all previous Post Office

convictions and a serious discussion with Fujitsu about the future of Horizon

and the consequences of Fujitsu's own behaviour.

        THE GROUP LITIGATION



280. Neither was I involved, except in one respect, in the Group Litigation. However,

      much as I wanted to, I could not except on narrowly defined terms ask

      questions or lead debates in the House of Lords because of the sub judice rule.



281. I was delighted when Alan Bates told me (I cannot remember when) that he had

      managed to secure litigation funding. And I had a discussion on 14th July

      2016230 with Kevan Jones for us to brief each other on how things were going.



282. But on 26th January 2017 I heard the news — through Nick Wallis — that the Post

      Office had accepted that the subpostmasters' accounts could be remotely

      accessed without the permission or knowledge of the subpostmasters. I

      thought at the time, as I think now, that this point went to the heart of the cases

      against the Post Office. It was an admission so fundamental, and so at odds

      with everything the Post Office had told subpostmasters, the courts, MPs and

      the media, that I thought the right thing for the Post Office then to have done

      would have been to concede and settle the cases. It threw into question, to put

      it at its lowest, the safety of the convictions against many, and perhaps all, of

      the subpostmasters, as well as those cases where subpostmasters had been

      sued rather than prosecuted, or coerced into paying money into the system

      before they were taken to court.

283. I was not surprised by the admission, because I now believed — rather than

      keeping an open mind about - both Michael Rudkin's story and the assertions in

      private conversations with Second Sight to the effect that all complicated

      accounting systems require some form of remote access. What did surprise

      me was the continuing aggression of the Post Office in defending the litigation.

      This was another missed opportunity to save money for the taxpayer and do

      right by the subpostmasters and even by the Post Office. Alan Bates told me

      that the Post Office was trying to spend so much (taxpayers') money on the

      litigation that the subpostmasters would run out of money first. I agreed.



284. Lucy Allen MP was later (27th April 2021)231 to describe the Post Office's

      behaviour in the following way:



               "Will the Minister ask his officials whether his Department authorised

               the Post Office to use millions of pounds of taxpayers' money to fight

               the sub-postmasters in that litigation, waging a war of attrition on them,

               purely to disguise the Horizon failings? Will he ask whether his

               predecessor, the Minister responsible for post offices in 2018-19, was

               aware of that, and if not, why not?"

      Hamilton to say:

               "the investigation phase of the CCRC's review is complete. We are now

               in a position to move into the decision-making phase of the cases this

               autumn".



286. When Nick Wallis heard about the CCRC letter, he wrote to the CCRC on 21st

      November 2018 and said,



               "I really really don't see how the CCRC can make an announcement on

               whether it is minded to refer these Postmaster cases to the Court of

               Appeal without waiting to see the transcripts in this trial and the

               forthcoming Horizon trial."



287. Nick Wallis forwarded a copy of his email to me and I believe he may well have

      rung me as well, to express his concern that the CCRC might be just about to

      reject the cases of subpostmasters even though important evidence against the

     Post Office was coming out in court on an almost daily basis. I wrote to the

      CCRC on the same day232 to say,



               "Mr Wallis has sent me a copy of the email he sent to you which is

               below. I have to say that he makes a very strong point. I would worry

               that any decision not to reopen these criminal cases, before the

               allegations have been examined in the cases that are currently before

               the court, might be subject to judicial review - and certainly would be if

               the current cases went against the Post Office."

       I do not know whether or not there was indeed a risk that the CCRC might

       have made premature decisions. In any event, they did not.



288. On 15th March 2019 the subpostmasters won their first of potentially five cases

      in a judgement by Mr Justice Fraser (as he then was) that I should not attempt

      to summarise. This was the turning point of the battle. I responded to the

      decision in various media interviews including one in Computer Weekly,233.



289. Baroness Neville-Rolfe's ministerial successor, Kelly Tolhurst MP, wrote to all

      MPs and Peers on 18th March 2019234 about the group litigation, saying that it

      was a matter for the courts to resolve but that she would be remaining in close

      contact with the Post Office over the coming weeks and months as they

      delivered on their "commitments to improve".



290. Their "commitments to improve" apparently began, on 21st March 2019, with

      the application, later described as "absurd" by the Court of Appeal, to recuse Mr

      Justice Fraser, an application served on the final day of evidence of the second

      trial. On 29th April 2019 I went to see Kelly Tolhurst in her office in the House

      of Commons. At that meeting I expressed strong disapproval of the way that

      the litigation between the subpostmasters and the Post Office was going. I was

      particularly concerned about the recusal application and the possibility that the

      Post Office might even appeal Mr Justice Fraser's decision not to recuse

     himself (they did). She told me that it had been made very clear to her that she

     was to keep out of the matter. She did not say who had made this clear, but I

     had the impression that it might have been the Permanent Secretary, because

     it would have to have been someone senior enough to tell a Minister what to

     do. But I did not ask, and I do not know.



291. The application for the recusal of the judge on 21st March 2019 was part of the

     Post Office's aggressive, expensive and delaying litigation tactics. Mr Justice

     Fraser had formed a judgment of the Post Office based on the evidence and

     had applied it accordingly, which it was his job to do. The Post Office did not

     like that, in much the same way as they had not liked the outcome of Second

     Sight's investigations, and therefore in much the same way tried to denigrate

     Mr Justice Fraser as they had tried to denigrate Second Sight.



292. By applying for his recusal, the Post Office ran up further costs for the

     subpostmasters, which contributed to forcing the subpostmasters towards

     settlement at the end of the second trial, even though there was envisaged to

     be a total of potentially five trials. It was an abuse of the legal system, a waste

     of a large amount of taxpayers' money and a further cruelty to subpostmasters

     who had been so badly treated already. I gather that the Post Office believed

     that it had no choice in applying for recusal. It was wrong.



293. Over the course of the period from my leaving the House of Commons to the

     date of this Witness Statement I have done numerous interviews and

     responded to numerous questions from journalists from all types of media, of


                                      Page 158 of 193

      which I have not kept a record. On 26th November 2019 I called, in Computer

      Weekly, for the removal of the Board of the Post Office235. I felt that the culture

      of the Board and the awful quality of its decisions were such that only its

      removal would allow the Post Office to improve. I took part in the Panorama

      programme of 2020, "Scandal at the Post Office" and BBC's Great Post Office

      Trial radio series, both going out in June and July 2020. On 25th April 2022 I

      took part in the Panorama programme — "The Post Office Scandal". On 2nd

      November 2023 I took part in an ITV programme about Wendy Cousins. The

      airing of the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, caused me to do many

      more interviews.



294. When the litigation settled, on 11th December 2019, many people (including

      myself) were dismayed at the low level of payment made by the Post Office to

      the subpostmasters, and even more so when it later transpired that the vast

      bulk of that payment was to go in the costs of lawyers and litigation funding.

      But I was not prepared to criticise Alan Bates, because I was not in the

      negotiations, I did not have the pressure of trying to fund any further litigation,

      nor the responsibility for the litigants that he did. But calls for a public inquiry

      began to grow.



295. I also believed that Fujitsu should bear its share of the blame and of the costs,

      and on 8th January 2020 an article by Karl Flinders in Computer Weekly

      contains the following quotation from me,

              "Peer James Arbuthnot, a staunch critic of the Post Office over the

             Horizon scandal, said: "It may well be that the Post Office may feel let

             down by Fujitsu, but it is certain that the subpostmasters will. Might

             they have a cause of action against Fujitsu for a breach of Fujitsu's

             duty of care?"



296. The settlement of the Group Litigation meant that Parliament was largely

     released from the restrictions of the sub judice rule (except in relation to those

     many cases that were still going through the process of convictions being

     overturned). Therefore I was able, as I did several times a year, to pursue

     different aspects of the matter (such as the need to reconsider the Post Office

     acting as prosecutor, the need for the Inquiry to be properly independent, the

     need to overturn the Group Litigation settlement, the need to hold Fujitsu to

     account and so on) in questions and debates in the House of Lords.



297. The next battle, carried out in different ways by different people, became to

     force the Government to accept its own share of the responsibility for the

     behaviour of the Post Office. As many people began to say, the Post Office

     was owned by the Government, funded by the Government and directed by the

     Government, and the Permanent Secretary of the BEIS Department (now DBT)

     was (and remains) the Accounting Officer. The Government's defence that it

     was an arms' length organisation was becoming less effective every day.

298. At around this point the Government abandoned the line that this was all a

      matter for the Post Office and moved on to the line that it had been misled by

      the Post Office. On 25th February 2020 Lord Callanan, the Minister in the

      House of Lords responsible for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy

      matters, said236,



                "The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy relied on

                Post Office management to investigate the issues with the Horizon

                system and the government was assured that the system was robust

                and the issues being raised by the postmasters were being handled

                appropriately. BETS pressed management on these issues and was

                given consistent advice from the company's experts that appeared to

                verify these claims at that time."



                "In hindsight, of course, facts have come to light through the litigation

                that has revealed that advice given during that period was flawed."



299. On 18th November 2020 some of the cases referred by the CCRC came before

      the Court of Appeal for procedural directions. I was not in court but read Nick

      Wallis' Twitter feed. I heard for the first time of the 2013 Clarke advice.



300. On 20th November 2020 I wrote to Lord Callanan237 as follows:

                "On Wednesday 18 November the Court of Appeal considered a piece

                of advice written by a barrister, Simon Clarke, in 2013 for the Post

                Office. According to Brian Altman QC, acting for the Post Office, this

                advice - which was apparently to the effect that the evidence of Gareth

                Jenkins (a former senior Fujitsu Horizon engineer) was wrong - was

                disclosed to Aria Grace solicitors (acting for three appellants) by Peters

                and Peters solicitors (acting for the Post Office) last week. As you

                know, the judge in the Horizon litigation referred Mr Jenkins' evidence

                to the DPP.



                In 2013 I and other MPs were in full flow of the discussion with Paula

                 Vennells and Alice Perkins about the unsafe nature of the Horizon

                convictions. We should have been told about this document, but I have

                not yet seen it. Please will you immediately send me a copy, and place

                it in the library of both Houses?"



301. On Saturday 21st November 2020238, I wrote to Mel Craig in Lord Callanan's

        office, copying it to the Post Office Minister Paul Scully MP, Speaker of the

        House of Commons and the Lord Speaker, as follows:



                "On 3rd February 2015 the BIS Select Committee took evidence in

                their inquiry into the Post Office Mediation scheme. Part of that

                evidence was a written submission from the Post Office, although they

                also received oral evidence from amongst others the Chief Executive of

the Post Office. Paragraph 11 of that written evidence

(http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evid

encedocument/business-innovation-and-skills-committee/post-office-

mediation/written/17827.pdf ) reads as follows:



       "At the start of the Scheme, both Post Office and the Justice for

       Subpostmasters Alliance made clear that mediation cannot

       overturn a conviction. This can only be done through established

       Court procedures. Post Office is under an absolute duty to

       disclose any evidence that might undermine a prosecution case

       or support the case of a defendant. It takes its responsibilities in

       this regard very seriously and Post Office's investigations have

       been carried out with this important duty firmly in mind. Post

       Office writes to everyone who has suggested they have or have

       seen evidence that a conviction is unsafe and asked them to

       disclose this so that it can be acted on. To date no such

       evidence has been provided."



"I suggest that the contemptibly late disclosure of the advice of Mr

Clarke - something that should have been in the public domain in 2013

- establishes that the Post Office lied to, and was in contempt of,

Parliament. The above quoted paragraph of the Post Office's written

advice was only one of many instances of this. I should be grateful if

you would consider my request for the immediate publication of the

advice in the light of this."

302. On 30th November 2020 Lord Callanan replied239 to say his department did not

      have a copy of the Clarke Advice and that it was for the Court of Appeal to

      decide the extent to which it should be disclosed.



303. I wrote back the same day240, saying that his department owned the Post

      Office, and pointing out that he had not commented on the Post Office's having

      lied.


304. On 7th December 2020 Lord Callanan said241 that his department had checked

      their files and really did not seem to have the Clarke Advice, that it was still a

      matter for the Court of Appeal, and that I should stop writing to him and write

      instead to the responsible minister, Paul Scully MP.




305. On 14th December 2020 I wrote to Paul Scully MP242, the Commons Minister

      with responsibility for the Post Office, and said,



                "It is now more than three weeks since I drew to your attention that the

                Post Office, which your department owns and for which you are

                responsible, lied to Parliament on 3rd February 2015. The lie went to

                the heart of the BIS Committee's inquiry, and the effect of it must have

                been to deny to the subpostmasters evidence and an argument about

                a lack of safety of their convictions which might have helped them in

                 their defence. The Post Office then went on to perpetuate the lie in the

                evidence they adduced and the arguments they made in the High

                 Court, costing the taxpayer well over £100 million.



                 "I am disappointed that, despite the importance of the matter and the

                fact that you are responsible for the Post Office, you have given me no

                response whatever. I am therefore writing to the Chair of the BEIS

                Select Committee to see what the Committee might be able to do in the

                matter."



306. On the same day, 14th December 2020 I did write to the Chair of the BEIS

      Committee, but on 16th December 2020 the BEIS Committee Clerk wrote243 to

      say they would not be considering the issue until after the Inquiry had reported.

      On that day I wrote a briefing note244 for Chi Onwurah MP (so far as I can

      remember at her request) to help her with her front bench responsibility for the

      Post Office on behalf of the Labour Party.



307. Paul Scully MP wrote to me on 18th December 2020245 making two points. The

      first, about the disclosure of the Clarke Advice, was as follows:


                 "As you know from the Court ofAppeal hearing on 3 December, the

                court has decided not to disclose the Clarke Advice. The Clarke Advice




243 [JARB0000141], [JARB0000142].

244 [JARB0000133].

245 [JARB0000143], [POL00104183].

             is a privileged document disclosed for a specific purpose in the

             proceedings. It also has the potential to impact a live police

             investigation. Post Office is respecting the court's decision to not

             disclose the advice at this time and we must do the same."



308. The second point was about whether the Post Office lied to the Select

     Committee. On that matter he relied on a Post Office Ltd statement which he

     attached to his letter. That statement concluded with the words,



             "Although Post Office cannot comment on the oral evidence provided

             to the Committee by its former Chief Executive, as only she can do

             that, the summary above suggests that the evidence was given in the

             context of the Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme and the steps

             taken to investigate cases through that scheme."



      I found his letter unpersuasive.

            GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS OVERTURNING OF GLO SETTLEMENT



309. On 29th April 2021 I wrote a series of answers to questions from Karl Flinders of

          Computer Weekly, stating, amongst other things, that the Government's refusal

          to compensate the Group Litigants was shameful.


310. I co-wrote, with Lord Falconer of Thoroton, an article for the Sunday Times of

          A
          I rs
               th
                    May 2021246, in which we called for the Government to give full

          compensation to all the victims of the scandal, and to hold to account Fujitsu,

          the Accounting Officers, the Post Office Board including the Government's

          representatives on it, the court system and the lawyers involved, so many of

          which had failed the subpostmasters so badly.



311. In June 2021 I wrote what I now consider to be a thoroughly bad-tempered

          email247 to the House Magazine (the Parliamentary in-house magazine) about

          their failure to cover the Horizon issue — it was a failure common to all too much

          of the media. They invited me to write an article, which came out in July 2021.


312. In late 2021 Kevan Jones MP at my request organised a meeting between the

          chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, Darren

          Jones MP, Kevan Jones and myself to see where the matter could be taken. I

          suggested that since compensation had been expressly excluded from the

          remit of the Inquiry there was still scope for the Select Committee to conduct a

          hearing on it. Darren Jones was receptive to the suggestion, and on 14th

         December 2021 his committee held the first of two hearings on the matter, the

         second being on 11th January 2022248 in which the Minister Paul Scully MP

         made it plain (without quite saying so) that he wanted to include the Group

         Litigants in the compensation schemes available to other subpostmasters. This

         lead to a most helpful report on 17th February 2022 which contributed to

         persuading the Government to reopen the Group Litigation settlement and to

         compensate the Group Litigants.

        GOVERNANCE



313. I turn next to the mechanism(s) in place to enable government oversight of the

      above issues and whether they were adequate. First perhaps I should give my

      - perhaps faulty - understanding of those mechanisms.



314. The Post Office is classified as a Public Non-Financial Corporation and is an

      organisation wholly owned by the Secretary of State of the relevant

      Department, the name of which has changed over the years. The Department

      is currently the Department of Business and Trade but during the time I was

      most involved, from 2012 to 2015, it was the Department of Business,

      Innovation and Skills.



315. Departments have Accounting Officers who are responsible for managing the

      public money the departments spend, and in the case of the Post Office the

      Accounting Officer is the Permanent Secretary. For much departmental

      spending the Accounting Officer takes personal responsibility for ensuring that

      the organisation they manage delivers the standards set out in paragraph 3.3 of

      "Managing Public Money"249 - standards which currently include requirements

      such that the organisation should:



             •   "have trustworthy internal controls to safeguard, channel and record

                 resources as intended




249 https://www.gov.0 lc/government/13u blIcationsirnanaging-public-money

                                                                                                       WITN00020100




            •   "treat its customers and business counterparties fairly, honestly and

                with integrity"

            •   and other matters.



        In my view it hardly needs to be said that the Post Office failed such

        standards. But it is a Public Non-Financial Corporation, or Arms' Length Body,

        so perhaps different standards apply to it.



316. Arms' Length Bodies are meant to have Framework Agreements. The Post

      Office's Framework Agreement25° is dated 25th March 2020. Prior to that, as I

      understand it, there was no such agreement between the Government and the

      Post Office governing how the relationship worked. I do not know if the

      absence of a Framework Agreement means that the standards to be applied to

      the Accounting Officer's role are those set out in paragraph 3.3 of "Managing

      Public Money".



317. Let us suppose, however, for want of anything better, that the standards set out

      in the current Framework Agreement are to be applied retrospectively to the

      Post Office's behaviour. According to Appendix 1 of that Agreement,



                "The organisation should:

                • have a governance structure which transmits, delegates, implements

                and enforces decisions

                • have trustworthy internal controls to safeguard, channel and record

                resources as intended

                • work cooperatively with partners in the public interest

                • operate with propriety and regularity in all its transactions

                • treat its customers and business counterparties fairly, honestly and

                with integrity

                • offer appropriate redress for failure to meet agreed customer

                standards

                • give timely, transparent and realistic accounts of its business and

                decisions, underpinning public confidence"



        Again, in my view it hardly needs to be said that the Post Office failed such

        standards.



318. However, it is not clear to me, in the case of an arms' length body, who is

      responsible for enforcing those standards. The House of Commons Public

      Accounts Committee, in its 18111Report of the 2021-22 session, Government's

      Delivery Through Arm's-Length Bodies251, said that in 2016 it



                "called for the Cabinet Office to use its unique position at the centre of

                government "to ensure that departments improve the way they manage

                their business through arm's-length bodies". Progress since then

               however has been limited."



       The Government agreed with the Committee's conclusions252. This is a

       subject on which there is urgent need for reform.



319. I have set out earlier in this Witness Statement my concerns about the

      Government's refusal to take the responsibility that naturally goes with

      ownership. Ministers asserted that they did not know and could not or would

      not find out what was going on in the Post Office. This is not oversight.



320. There is the additional issue of democratic control. If an organisation as central

      to the lives of so many people in our communities is not subject (through

      Parliament and MPs) to the control of those communities, then over time things

      will go seriously wrong, as has happened in this case.



321. On Wednesday 7th February 2024 I asked253 in the House of Lords,



                "In an arm's-length organisation, to whom in practice is the chief

                executive accountable? Is it the department's Permanent Secretary?"



               I received the answer,

             ""I thank my noble friend for his question and for all his efforts on behalf

             of the postmasters. We have to realise that this is a limited company

             owned entirely by the Government, with one share owned by the

             Secretary of State. It separated from Royal Mail Group when that went

             private, but the Post Office is actually classified as a public non-

             financial corporation. Public corporations include, for example,

             Ordnance Survey, Royal Mint and British International Investment.

             They are typically owned by the appropriate Secretary of State in that

             department, the reason being that they are hybrid: the Post Office has

             commercial activity, it makes revenue through the post offices, but it

             also receives public money to support the network. As a result, the

             governance is such that the chief executive reports to the chair, the

             chair reports to the Secretary of State, and the chief executive also

             reports to the Permanent Secretary when it comes to public money."



322. The Permanent Secretaries involved with Horizon since I first became involved

     have been Sir Simon Fraser (2009-2010), Sir Martin Donnelly (2010-2016, the

     period when the Horizon shortcomings should have been properly addressed)

     and Sir Alex Chisholm (2016-2020, the period when the litigation should have

     been properly addressed). In view of the lack of clarity in the oversight

     arrangements for the Post Office, it is not clear to me what personal

     responsibility each of these accounting officers has for the costs the country

     now faces. Neither do I know what they actually did in their roles and it might

     be helpful to discover that.

323. Paragraph 11.1 of the Framework Agreement Articles of Association254 states

       that,



                  "POL requires the prior written consent of the Shareholder for any

                 undertaking to incur any expenditure in excess of £50,000,000."



        I asked a question about this and received the following answer255 on 8th

        February 2024:



                  "Under its Articles ofAssociation, the Post Office is required to gain

                 prior written consent from the Shareholder before entering into a

                  transaction which involves the incurrence of a commitment, liability or

                 payment of a sum in excess of £50 million. Officials have checked our

                 records and have seen no evidence of any such written consent."



324. It is, therefore, my current view that at least Sir Martin Donnelly and Sir Alex

       Chisholm — neither of whom is yet on the Inquiry's list of potential witnesses to

       give oral evidence — might wish to explain whether they could or should have

       stepped forward to stop the Post Office from incurring potential liabilities for (in

       Sir Martin's case) compensation such as we now see materialising at perhaps

       £1 billion and (in Sir Alex's case) litigation costing over £100 million.

325. As regards the Ministers involved, I have set out above the responses I got.

     Some were a little more helpful than others. Lord Mandelson referred me to his

     junior minister, Pat McFadden MP — which is fair enough, junior ministers have

     their role. Pat McFadden passed on the departmental mantra that this was an

     arms' length body and a matter for the Post Office. Ed Davey MP did likewise.

     Jo Swinson MP showed a lack of curiosity surprising in a minister, given the

     strength of feeling that was on display during both the statement on the Interim

     Report and the Adjournment debate in December 2014. David Cameron, as

     Prime Minister, simply passed me on to Vince Cable MP, the Secretary of State

     — again, fair enough, Secretaries of State have their role - who wrote me a letter

     that I have said above was to all intents and purposes pointless. Kelly Tolhurst

     MP was warned off getting involved, and accepted the warning. Perhaps it

     would be unfair to expect a junior minister to step away from the boundaries so

     rigorously set by many more senior who had gone before. Baroness Neville-

     Rolfe did try to take action in speaking to the incoming chairman of the Post

     Office, but then (we later learnt) seems not to have received a copy of the

     review she caused to be produced.



326. As a catalogue of failure of oversight, all this seems hard to beat.



327. It was only when on 26th February 2020 Boris Johnson, the new Prime

     Minister, answered a question from Kate Osborne MP and promised (no doubt

     much to the surprise of his officials and of the Post Office) a public inquiry that

     the logjam broke. This was the second turning point in the story, but it is hardly

     an example of good governance. And thereafter Paul Scully MP and Kevin


                                      Page 175 of 193
                                                                                        WITN00020100




     Hollinrake MP have tried hard to ensure that justice is done and compensation

     paid, but the sclerosis of government has hindered them both.



328. The final point I have to make about governance (in which I profess no

     expertise) is that the Chairman and Board of Directors — all appointed by and

     therefore removable by and answerable to the Government - had an important

     part to play in the oversight of the Post Office. I recognise that the following

     points are made with the benefit of hindsight, but one of the purposes of a

     board of directors is to exercise foresight. Some of the areas (and I suspect

     this may be a small sample) where they might have asked important questions,

     but either did not do so or allowed themselves to be satisfied with answers that

     may have been unsatisfactory, include the following:



     a.   When introducing a new computer system, how likely is it that it will be so

          free of error that you can base prosecutions upon it?



     b.   Do complicated new computer systems routinely — or perhaps always —

          come with remote access to them?



     c.   Have any reports to the Board included reference to remote access?


     d.   In 1997, before the introduction of Horizon, the number of prosecutions

          was 10. In 2001, after the introduction of Horizon, the number was 80.

          Should this have rung warning bells?




                                      Page 176 of 193

e.   If we accept as a fact that the Post Office suspected, before the

     introduction of Horizon, that there was a large amount of undiscovered

     fraud going on, what weight should have been given to the possibility that

     that suspicion might have been wrong, and that it was the new system

     that might be to blame for any increase in prosecutions?


f.   In contracting for the maintenance of a new computer system, is it

     appropriate to permit the contractor to charge for disclosure of details of

     whether there are errors in that equipment or software?



g.   What was the role of suspense accounts?



h.   In devising bonus schemes, is it appropriate to:



     i    incentivise the recovery of money in priority to the interests of truth

          or justice?



     ii   Incentivise compliance with a public inquiry into the failures of your

          own organisation?



     What legal advice is the Board receiving about multiple allegations of

     miscarriages of justice, and what is the Board doing about it?



     Is the culture of the organisation one which encourages or discourages

     whistle-blowing?



                                Page 177 of 193
                                                                                            WITN00020100




     k.   How, both as a board and as an organisation, do we fight against

          groupthink?



          In rejecting the proposition put forward by a substantial group of MPs (that

          there should be a presumption that the Mediation Scheme should accept

          the recommendation of the forensic accountants chosen and appointed by

          the Post Office), do we need to consider the interests of justice as well as

          the apparent immediate interests of the Post Office?



329. There is one further point I should make which is not precisely related to

     governance, and it is about the role of auditors. I am aware that the Inquiry

     Chair has decided not to include within the scope of the Inquiry a consideration

     of what auditors knew or did not know, because it would have added

     disproportionately to the length of the Inquiry. Of course I do not question that

     decision. The point I do nevertheless wish to make is that it is the duty of

     auditors to determine whether the accounts present a true and fair view of a

     company's financial state. If auditors fail to establish the existence of a

     potential liability of over £1 billion, then their reports are of less value than we

     might wish. And their failure to identify this potential (and now actual) liability

     was yet another missed opportunity to put things right.

      REDRESS



330. The drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office — the third turning point in the scandal

     (the first being the Fraser judgement and the second being Kate Osborne MP's

     question to the Prime Minister) - has galvanised the nation. This was what I

     said needed to happen in the Today Programme interview on 9th December

     2014. One of the many terrible facets of this story is that it has taken so long.



331. I do believe that the Government, with all political parties much aligned on this,

     is now focusing on the need for overturning wrongful convictions, paying

     redress to subpostmasters and holding to account those responsible for the

     actions, failures and human consequences outlined in the drama. And because

     of all the missed opportunities it has taken longer than it should and cost more

     than it should. And there are many loose ends to tidy — including, for example,

     the employees of subpostmasters who have suffered, those who were

     employed not by the Post Office but by partner organisations such as McCoils

     or the Co-op, and the subpostmasters' families who themselves have been put

     through ghastly experiences yet have not been included in the compensation

     schemes.



332. But sitting as I do on the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board I am seeing at

     first hand the day to day struggles of the Government to speed up the payment

     of money to the subpostmaster victims, and to pass unprecedented legislation

     to overturn hundreds of convictions. We are doing what we can to cut out as

     much as possible of the unthinking bureaucracy that inevitably goes with the

     spending of public money.



333. The drama has nevertheless brought home to us that too many people have

     died before we reached this point. I find it difficult to stop thinking of them.
