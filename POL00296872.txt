Well... my pressure on Rudkin has paid off. He eventually found the attached doc which shows that the person he met at
Bracknell was Martin ROLFE.

POL needs to get Martin's side of the story straight way. Also, please let's find out why he did not come forward earlier
(you told us you'd contacted all the Basement team to ask if they'd met Rudkin, yes?).

Best regards, Ron.
