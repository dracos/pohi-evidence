Subject: NFSP media line on Horizon / Justice for Subpostmasters Allaince
Dear Sue

George has asked me to forward for information the statement (below) which the NFSP issued to the
media last year following enquiries on the issues raised by the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance; and
which was issued again earlier this week in response to an enquiry from the BBC.

NFSP General Secretary George Thomson: “We have complete confidence in the Horizon system, which
carries out hundreds of millions of transactions every week at 12,000 Post Office outlets across the
country. The NFSP has seen no evidence to suggest that Horizon has been at fault — we believe it to be
robust, as does Post Office Ltd, with whom we have regular discussions on the system.”

Kind regards
Paul
