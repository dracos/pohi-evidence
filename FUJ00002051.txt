5 Exclusion Details - Engineering Service and
Branch Network Service

Further details of the reasons for exclusion listed in Table 1 are provided below. The exclusions relate to
both SLTs and Liquidated Damages and, unless otherwise stated, apply to all faults.

5.1 Access times

Calls will be suspended for any time outside the access hours as provided by the branch, which may be
greater or more restrictive than the opening hours. In the case of portables the access times are when
the engineer can have access to the portable at the location at which the fault can be resolved.

5.2 Engineer refused access to Branch

Where an engineer has visited the branch within the specified access times but has been refused access
to the branch. This exclusion will apply to all engineer visits e.g. Fujitsu engineer, BT engineer.

5.3 Tivoli indicates Branch/Counter operational

Calls will be suspended when the event management system indicates that the branch/counter is
operational. This will allow for accurate suspension on intermittent communications faults and also when
the engineer is delayed in returning the call closure notification. This exclusion will apply to Hardware
base unit and Branch Network Incidents only.

5.4 Functionality not impacted by fault

Where the fault does not have a consistent effect on the operation of the branch e.g. reboot required
each morning but thereafter service is fully operational for the remainder of the day, whilst awaiting
engineer visit. This is not applicable to portables at the storage location, see 5.1.

5.5 Call reclassification (ND to HD)

If during the investigation of a network fault (ND) it is identified that the fault is with the base unit, the call
will be recoded to HD. The call will be suspended from the open time until the call is passed to
engineering, which may include the time the call is with BT. This exclusion will apply to Hardware base
unit incidents only, which have been recoded from ND to HD.

5.6 Incident passed out of Fujitsu domain

Where the incident has been passed out of the Fujitsu domain e.g. where the branch details are passed
to BT or referral to POL agreed. The call is suspended from the time the call was passed out of the
Fujitsu domain until the time the call is passed back to Fujitsu Services.

5.7 Unable to contact Branch to progress resolution

Where the Service Desk or Third Line Support have been unable to contact the branch to arrange an
engineer visit or provide remote assistance. It should be evident within the call that reasonable

endeavours were used to contact the branch. The call is suspended after reasonable endeavours to
contact the branch were made until the time that contact with the branch is established.

5.8 Clear time requires adjustment

Where it is evident that the service became operational prior to the clear time specified in the call. The
call is suspended from the time that the service became operational until the clear time.

5.9 Delay in resolution — Not Fujitsu default

Where an engineer has been delayed in visiting branch(es) in a geographical area due to reasons
completely out of the control of Fujitsu Services. The call is suspended from the time that access is
prevented until the time it becomes available again. Details of the delay in resolution must be recorded
and exclusion agreed with Post Office Operations Control.

When the build of a gateway is delayed due to an incorrectly filtered Redcare alarm, and the engineer
has to leave site to obtain a specialist filter (non standard equipment), the call will be suspended from
the time the engineer leaves site to collect the filter to the time that he/she returns to resolve the fault.
This suspension equates to the time it takes for the engineer to receive the specialist filter plus the retum
journey to branch, and must not include the time spent on other calls, whilst in possession of the filter.

5.10 Branch in OBC status

Where the fault relates to an OBC Branch Change which is in the course of completion.

5.11 Agreed pilot site

Where the fault relates to a pilot site which is excluded from SLTs and Liquidated Damages as agreed

by POL.

5.12 Fault due to enforced closure, third party or user
error/damage/negligence

Where it is evident within the call that the fault has been caused by circumstances of enforced closure,
user or third party error, damage or negligence.

5.13 Call cancelled by Branch

Where the branch has taken action to resolve the fault, or the fault has resolved itself, and the call has
subsequently been cancelled.

5.14 No fault found by engineer

Where an engineer has visited the branch but has taken no action due to the service being fully
operational. This exclusion will apply to Hardware Incidents only.

5.15 POA internally raised call

Where the call has been incorrectly logged against a live branch when it has been internally raised by
POA.

5.16 Indeterminate resolution

Where a fault has been resolved but both its cause and resolution are unclear. For example, where a
fault is investigated by a number of areas, say, HSD, SSC, BT and POL, who all undertake actions to try
and resolve the fault but, although the fault is resolved, its cause and the resolving action are unclear. It
should be evident within the call that reasonable endeavours were used to diagnose the cause of the
fault and to resolve it.

5.17 Service disabled by agreement with POL

Where the service has been disabled by agreement with POL e.g. for protection against a computer
virus.

5.18 Network wide failure

Where the fault results from failure of the HNG-X Central Infrastructure and/or the Central Telecom
Infrastructure which results in a loss of the availability of one or more branches and counter positions.
Such faults will be included in the Network Wide Failure unavailability figures and therefore individual
calls in respect of this failure may be excluded.

6 Exclusion Details - Data File Delivery

Further details of the reasons for exclusion listed in Table 2 are provided below. The exclusions relate to
both SLTs and Liquidated Damages.

6.1 Access times

Calls will be suspended for any time outside the access hours as provided by the branch, which may be
greater or more restrictive than the opening hours. In the case of portables the access times are when
the engineer can have access to the portable at the location at which the fault can be resolved.

6.2. Branch in OBC status

See Section 5.10

6.3 Fault due to enforced closure, third party or user
error/damage/negligence
See Section 5.12

6.4 Engineer unable to access Branch and/or kit

Where the engineer has been unable to gain access to the branch/kit e.g. refused by PM or for Health
and Safety reasons.

6.5 Let agreed by POL/Fujitsu

Where a let for a branch has been jointly agreed by POL and Fujitsu Services.
