Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Royal Mail v_C.J.Trousdale

During the above case, which was concluded on 31°‘ march 2004, the prosecution
accepted on more than one occasion, that the accounts presented to the court by Royal
Mail were incorrect. It was stated that the correct figures would be presented at the next
hearing — this never happened.

I would now like this matter to be addressed and to be refunded the money, which Royal

Mail has been holding since that time.

Yours faithfully,

Christopher Trousdale

Dear Sir

I refer to the letter of 26" July 2005, in which Nicola Knight informed me that
details of my letter of 4" July 2005 had been forwarded to you for investigation.

A full four months has now passed and I am appalled not to have even received
an acknowledgement.

I had hoped that this matter would have been resolved easily, but considering the
excessive length of time that has elapsed, I will have no option other than to
hand the matter to a solicitor, unless a satisfactory reply is received within 14
days. You have, after all, had 20 months now to sort out your accounts and pay
us what is owed.

I hope that this time you have the courtesy to reply and that the matter is not
simply swept under the carpet again.

Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Trowsdale

I refer to your letter of the 2 December 2005. I had previously requested Mr Robertson to carry out
enquiries into the matter you raised. My understanding is that these matters are normally dealt with
by the Late Account Duty at the Financial Accounting Division Headquarters in Chesterfield. Their
address is Transaction Processing, Ground Floor East, 1 Future Walk, Chesterfield, S49 1PF
(Reference Carol King). I have asked Mr Robertson to refer the matter to them for their attention (if
this has not already occurred) and for the matter to be dealt with expeditiously.

Yours sincerely

Nicola Knight
