Support Services Resolution
Team(SSRT) ie. end to end
from issue/discrepancy being
flagged/identified to findings of
investigation being produced
and shared with spmr/branch.

Full root cause analysis done
by SSRT when a branch flags a
discrepancy.

approach will piece together
what has or rather what has
not happened in branch in a
timely manner with a high
degree of accuracy so Post
Office can establish whether
there has been a shortfall
and, in many cases, its likely
root cause.

By sharing the investigation
findings with spmr/branch,
Post Office can reach a final
position more quickly
resulting in increased
recovery of losses from
spmrs by showing that they
are at fault
