are customer specific messages received daily (DCM) & Daily Tariff files received daily
(DRD)

1.0 Management Summary

The first file problem with the .DCM file was initially alerted by CFM1 on 19" July 04
following receipt of an alert on the BMC patrol, which referred to a Quantum file failing
checksum validation. A subsequent call was raised by operations following this alert at
23:19hrs. On further investigation it was discovered that .DCM files had not been processed
since 10" July 04 (S60 Data Centre upgrade), but all files had generated a similar BMC alert.

The second file problem related to the .DRD file, following a more detailed analysis for the
reasons of the .DCM file failing validation, it was discovered that this file also had been
failing validation also since the 10" July 04 (S60 Data Centre upgrade).

Throughout these problems the correct escalation routes — including to POL ~ were followed.

Full services were resumed on 24" July 04, following successful development and testing of
the required scripts prior to release into the live estate.

2.0 Description of the fault and service failure

2.1 Symptoms and Business Impact

2.1.1 Symptoms as seen by Branches

Whilst it cannot be guaranteed, it is likely that individual branches may not have witnessed
any symptoms bought on by this failure. This is due to the fact that whilst we receive files on
a daily basis they rarely change in detail form week to week. Where changes had been made
to either Tariff data or customer specific messages, the branches would only have discovered
this through customers querying either their credit or debit or changes to their supply of gas
in terms of tariffs.

2.2. Detailed explanation of the incident

S60 involved moving the APS Host application from its original host platform running on the
Dynix operating system to a new platform running on a Solaris operating system in order to
ensure continued support. This involved a number of program code changes to accommodate
some differences in the operating systems. One of these was unfortunately missed in the
change. This bug caused the checksum field on these inbound files to be incorrectly
identified as the wrong type of data and passed to validation as a hex value instead of a
numeric field. This caused the files to be incorrectly rejected, the failure of delivery of the
data to the counters and a rejection sent to the client.

Alerts were being generated on both of these file types. However, due to the number of
spurious alerts generated following the S60 upgrade, it would appear that these alerts where
ignored as they were considered, albeit erroneously, to be insignificant. The incident raised
on 19th July followed a more detailed review of those BMC alerts, which remained after the
quantity of spurious alerts had fallen.

The patrol user environment was not fully migrated from DYNIX to Solaris at S60 — this has
since been corrected in live through OCP being raised and actioned.
