lam the person named above and have been employed by the Post Office for approximately
22 years. I am currently employed as a Contract & Service Advisor based in Bournemouth.
Although over recent years my job title has changed I have been involved in dealing with
Subpostmaster contractual issues since September 2001.

I am responsible for a number of Sub Post Office Branches (SPOB) within the Post Office
network. The area that I cover can change from time to time, although on 09 March 2006 the
Post Offices that I was responsible included those in the Reading (RG) postcode area.

I can confirm from business records that on 09 March 2006 the Postmaster of South

Warnborough SPOB was a Mrs Josephine Hamilton, who had been in post since 21 October

2003. —
1 conductedan interview With Mrs Hamilton on 17 September 2003 and she was subsequently

appointed Subpostiniaster of South Warnborough SPOB. During the interview, I would have
ascertained whether Mrs Hamilton required any training. From looking at the Training
Requirements For Incoming Subpostmasters form that I completed following the interview I
can see that against item 2, it indicates by an X in the NO box that no tr: ining was required. I
now produce a copy of that form as item NA/01 and I have signed an exhibit tabel bearing that
item number.

As Subpostmaster, Mrs Hamilton was responsible for the general day to day running of the
Office. All Sub Postmasters on appointment are bound by a contract with Post Office Ltd

Continuation of statement of Nigel ALLEN

Section 12 of the Sub postmaster's contract deals specifically with the treatment of Post Office
Ltd cash and stock and how to deal with deficiencies in the Post Office accounts.

Section 12.3 states that “ The Sub Postmaster is expressly forbidden to make use of the
balance due to Post Office Limited for any purpose other than the requirements of the Post
Office service; and he must, on no account apply to his own private use, for however short a
period, any portion of Post Office Limited funds entrusted to him. He must also be careful to
keep the Post Office money separate from any other monies. Misuse of Post Office Limited
cash may render the offender liable to prosecution and, or, the termination of his Contract of
Appointment.”

At 12.4 itis stated “The Sub Postmaster must ensure that accounts of all stock and cash
entrusted to him by Post Office Limited are kept in the form prescribed by Post Office Limited.
He must immediately produce these accounts, and the whole of his Sub Office cash and stock
for inspection whenever so requested by a person duly authorised by the Regional General
Manager.”

At 12.12 itis stated “The Sub Postmaster is responsible for all losses caused through his own
negligence, carelessness or error, and also for losses of all kinds caused by his assistants
Deficiencies due to such losses must be made good without delay.”

Stated at 12.13 is “The financial responsibility of the Sub Postmaster does not cease when he
Telinquishes his appointment and he will be required to make good any losses incurred during
his term of office which may subsequently come to light.”

I now produce a photocopy of section 12 of the Sub postmaster’s contract as item NA/02 and

have signed an exhibits label bearing that item number.
