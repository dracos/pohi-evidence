Audit of Walton On Thames 090 023

An audit was undertaken at the above office by myself and supported by Sue Le
May on Friday 7 March 2003 as a result of discrepancies that were highlighted
in post audit checks relating to rems following the last audit conducted on the 15"
November 2002.

The audit commenced at approx 08:55 at which point Mr Yates was not present
and the office had been prepared by one of the counter assistants. I informed him
of our intention to complete an audit of the office and that the office would remain
closed until a result had been reached. Mr Yates arrived at approx 09:05 where I
informed him of the process of the day as previously discussed with the counter
assistant. I asked Mr Yates to print an office snapshot from the Horizon system
which indicated an overall office cash holding of £410354.67. I then asked him to
provide me with the previous nights ONCH declaration. This indicated a total
holding of £43566.00. I asked Mr Yates why there was such a large variance
between what had been declared to that on the office snapshot. He informed me
that he had sent a rem the previous day but had not booked it out on the Horizon
system. I asked him to produce both the rem undercopies P884 and the CIT
collection receipts which he was unable to do. At this point Mr Yates admitted that
he had not sent any rems the previous day and that the audit would reveal a
shortage in the region of £350k.

I informed the Operations Manager Mr Michael Dadra of the position who
contacted Paul Dawkins the Internal Crime Manager for that geographical area
who arranged for Dave Posnett and Rob Fitzgerald to attend and interview the
subpostmaster.

The audit revealed a total shortage of £359325.71 which is broken down as
follows-

Cash short from snapshot £356541.35
Nat Lottery Tickets disallowed (Out of date) £483.00
Littlewoods Tickets disallowed (Out of date) £650.00
National Lottery Tickets short from snapshot £208.00
Charge error notice bta on audit £112.00

Claim error notices bta on audit - £512.28
Previous weeks surplus not withdrawn - £144.20
Net shortages in stock from snapshot £1987.84
Total £359325.71

The audit shortage was transferred to the late account and the cash and stock
secured and overlocked in the safes pending the Retail Line Manager Elaine
Wright arranging the office to be transferred to a temporary subpostmaster.

During the audit 5133 mvl discs were discovered in the counter insert safe. These
were dated from August 1999 to February 2003. From discussions with the
subpostmaster it would seem that these were booked out on the office
reconciliation but never sent. I made checks with the reconciliation duty in
Chesterfield on the day who confirmed that there were returns which had not
been confirmed by Hemel although there does not seem to be any evidence of
follow up action to date. No reconciliation could be produced by Mr Yates in order
that a reconciliation of discs could be performed on the audit.
