Dave Posnett - I conducted Torch visits to a number of branches on
11/04/13 (security visits) and whilst at Westerham (FAD 056948), the
manager (Atul Desai) just happened to show me a real time anomaly.
He had a customer in front of him who wanted to post a small
standard letter (25g) by recorded delivery (signed for). Atul
explained that it should be £1.70 (and I’ve checked and can confirm
that £1.70 is correct). I associate 3 photos below, which show;

1. The Horizon screen - 11° April (during Torch visit) - screen
clearly shows the weight of 25g in the top right hand corner.
However, there are no options displayed concerning a ‘1** class
signed for letter’ at £1.70 (in the left side service
column). Instead the signed for options start at £3.70 for a
‘24 class signed for small parcel’ to £6.75 for a ‘1* class
signed for medium parcel’. Atul said he has had problems re
this for the past few days and has to reboot the terminal to
rectify, which takes a number of minutes to perform. He has
retained letters and asked customers to pop back for their
receipts/proof of posting (as these are generated from
Horizon, once rebooted and once the ‘1% class signed for
letter’ option returns).

3. Branch calendar - on 9°" April Atul has written a similar

entry. He has also written ‘Called Helpline 10.15am’, and
‘Jessica H17950181’ and ‘Louise A2636382, Technical Support’.
He was advised to reboot, w h he did, and had no problems
for the remainder of 9*° April or 10** April.

But the problem did return on 11 April (as per 1 above). When I
left the branch the Horizon system was still rebooting, with a few
customers in the queue who couldn't be served until the reboot had
completed.
