Impact statements must consider all transitional states between Horizon and HNG-X, as well
as the final HNG-X solution.

Description of Change Proposed:

The Audit system supports a service (the Prosecution Support Service) whereby POL can request an
extract of historical data that is held within the Audit archive. Typically this requires retrieval of
archived Riposte transaction data. The data, as returned to POL, is often used to support legal
proceedings where, say, a postmaster is accused of fraud. In such cases, we must also provide a
witness statement with the audit data which attests to its provenance and integrity.

In order to further automate this service under HNG-X, for every branch Riposte data retrieval, the
archived events generated by counters at the branch are also analysed to identify any possible
occurrences of problems which might adversely affect the integrity of the transaction data.

The current Horizon tactical solution is a largely manual process, the operation of which is reliant on a
few key individuals. Whilst we believe that we will have to live with this tactical solution for the
remaining life of the Horizon Audit system, a permanent solution for the HNG-X Audit solution is
required. In outline, this will require the following:

> Amending the HNG-X Audit server (ARC) and workstation (AUW) applications to
automatically retrieve and filter Events data when performing Horizon branch data retrievals.’
» Amending the HNG-X Audit server (ARC) and workstation (AUW) applications to
automatically retrieve and filter Events data when performing HNG-X branch data retrievals.”
>» Introduce Prosecution Support process changes around the operation of the amended

system.
> Identify suitable skilled & committed resources to perform any manual analysis required.
» Identify all ongoing operational costs associated with operating the revised service.

Acceptance Criteria and Methods (Functional and Non Functional):
Testing will be required to ensure that all counter events are extracted by the system and presented to
the Audit workstation user for further analysis

Reason for Change and Justification for Required Date (above):

While we do not believe that (due to time constraints) it is practicable to introduce this change into
Horizon, it is required to ensure the viability of the ongoing Prosecution Support service within HNG-
x.

Consequences if Not Approved:
» Weare obliged to present, and vouch for the integrity of, Audit data that is fit for purpose - i.e.
admissible as evidence in court. If this change is not approved, we will need to continue
operating the current Horizon tactical process for the lifetime of HNG-X.

This solution has a number of deficiencies :

» It is a largely manual process which is error prone & time consuming.

»  Itinvolves moving large volumes of data between the Audit server and workstation

> Itis reliant on ad hoc tooling & hardware

> Itis reliant on a few key individuals

> It requires local & insecure storage of event audit data, invalidating certain statements made
within the current witness statement

» Ithas no DR mechanism in the event of DR from BRAO1 to LEW02

‘The HNG-X Audit solution will need to continue to support the retrieval & analysis of Horizon branch audit

? While there is no reason to believe that the HNG-X counter will suffer the same deficiencies as the Horizon
counter, it is advisable that similar checks are performed in both environments
