I have had a meeting with RO from post office.
I have requested the following info.

1. Copy of all quarterly audits over the qualifying period in order to establish
how and when the embezzlement took place. He indicated that these documents
would be difficult to obtain as they are kept by an independent company who
charge a lot of money to provide them.

2. The criticism of the post office Horizon system has yet to be answered. RO
from post office has stated that he would be unable to defend the system if this
case was to go to court.
