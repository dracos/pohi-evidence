Thanks Ben. I thought as much but just wanted to double check.

I would still appreciate a quick call from you, Kate or Alan, in the next hour or so if possible, to
clarify a couple of queries regarding the status of the settlement vis a vis the convicted
claimants.

Kind regards

Morning Richard

Thanks for your email. The potential budget of [IEEE does include the proposed historic

Hope that helps.

Thanks for this. I have recently texted asking for a quick chat. The issue I wanted to understand
better was the relationship between the potential budget of [INN for future claims which
you kindly set out below and the proposed historic shortfall group to deal with any shortfalls
which arose between 2000 and the effective date of the settlement deed. Is there a separate
estimated budget for that historic shortfall group or is that covered by the

estimate?

Kind regards

Hi Richard

Thanks for your email.
UKG100018815
UKGI00018815

As you appreciate we will not be able to accurately predict how many claims will be made and
the merits until they are in fact made. The team are still working through a more scientific
analysis which we will provide in due course. The settlement of these proceedings is of course
distinct from these future claims.

At a headline level, we may want to consider a potential budget of [EEE for the future

claims although these numbers need subsequent verification. The methodology for these
numbers is based on the following assumptions:

This assumes 100% liability and no discount over evidential or time bar issues. However, it does
not take into account the operational costs of managing the above process. We intend to
establish a mediation scheme for the above claims which ultimately can be resolved by
arbitration rather than court proceedings. The above exposure does not take into account the
separate compensation for the convicted claimants who manage to have their convictions
overturned. HSF previously advised that if all 61 convicted claimants had their convictions

overturned there could be a further exposure of EEE due to the stigma claims on top of
the above range.

Finally, Post Office has just made an offer £45m (plus the £5.5m which Post Office was ordered
to pay in costs following the ClJ which was already approved). Their previous offer was £65m
plus £5.5m for the ClJ costs. We are awaiting to hear back.

Shall we have a call now to take you and Tom through the non-financial elements of the
settlement as summarised in my note last night and the above numbers and methodology.
Kind regards
Ben

Hi Richard

I have sent Tom Cooper an email updating him on the mediation and other matters earlier this
evening. Below sets out our update in respect of the mediation. We suggest a call with Tom and
yourself tomorrow to take you through the details.

Mediation Update- Settlement Deed

As indicated in my previous email, the parties have focused on the non-financial aspects of the
settlement over the last two days. Attached is the draft settlement agreement which is still a
work in progress. Broadly, the non-financial aspects of the settlement include:

e Agreed joint statement by the parties which recognises the past experience of the
claimants and our desire to learn the lessons and improve our relationship with
postmasters as well as noting that the parties have engaged with each other in good
faith in this mediation process

POL’s approach in respect of the convicted claimants and its undertaking to comply
with its ongoing duties. This points out that although the proceedings are
comprehensively settled Post Office has not made any payment to or of the benefit of
the convicted claimant. Post Office undertakes to take advise from a leading criminal
barrister and as a minimum to act upon and follow the legal advice it receives in respect
of what position it should take if a convicted claimant obtains permission to appeal. If the
convicted claimant's conviction was overturned as a result of the breaches by Post
Office of which complaint is made in the action, Post Office will issue an apology. We
make it clear that there is no admission to liability or wrong doing by virtue of this
agreement.

POL’s support in respect of claimants who wish to exit the business post settlement
POL to withdraw proof of debt or claim in respect of insolvent claimants as part of the
settlement

A support programme for claimant SPM and SPM in similar position of the claimants
including mental health support for claimants

POL to consult claimant group on the change process and for them to have some form
of consultancy role advising the business, which could include input to consideration of
the future of the Post Office, but no right to determine issues or make decisions. This
gives rise to the creation of a “Idea Sharing Group” of which Post Office would listen and
consider on a quarterly basis for no less than 12 months post settlement.

UKGI00018815

POL would also set up a historic shortfall group to deal with any shortfalls which arose
between 2000 and the effective date of the settlement deed with an internal escalation
and ultimately arbitration as a resolution forum (rather than the public court process)
POL not the enforce SPM debts pending implementation of the settlement agreement
Emergency funding for hardship cases which is to be taken out of the funds of the
settlement and administered by the claimant group.

POL agrees to consider the giving of a bibliographical reference to postmasters which
confirms the duration of their tenure and there appointment as a postmaster with the
confirmation that they are agents and not employees.

¢ Claimants solicitors and funders not to solicit new claims

Given the amount of detail, could I suggest that we take you and Tom through these points
tomorrow over the phone. We are bound to have some down time tomorrow in between offers.

Public Announcement — Mediation Outcome
Patrick has flagged to me that there could be a question from the shareholder as to whether it
would be feasible to have the mediation settlement subject to HMG approval. This suggestion
would be very difficult for a number of reasons:

¢ There would be a very high risk that it would derail the mediation process in two ways:

o The parties have embarked on a process in good faith that each side had the
authority to mediate and seek to resolve the matter on agreed terms. For Post
Office to now advise on Day 6 of the mediation that any agreement would then
be subject to further approval by the HMG risks being seen as having not
operated in good faith.

o If there is a further hurdle for the Claimants to clear to achieve settlement,
tactically they may wish to not proceed to their best and final offers in the
mediation because there is either a further round of negotiation with the
government or they may think they can secure a greater financial settlement from
HMG. I am not speaking to the accuracy of that assertion but the risk around that
perception.

It may not be in HMG interests to be seen publicly as making this decision.

Happy to discuss tomorrow on our proposed call.

Do let me know when is convenient time to contact Tom and yourself tomorrow (probably
around lunch time is best if that’s possible).

Kind regards
Ben
