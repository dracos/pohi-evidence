Helen

Please see attached copy of summons — due in court 30 May 2012. Despite the numerous phone calls / e mails he still
has not got his solicitor to send in the Letter of Undertaking, so don’t know if the Post Office has been sold and a new
spmr has taken over.

Anything else that you need?

Steve
