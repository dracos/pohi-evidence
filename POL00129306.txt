All,

I’ve spoken with Martin Smith and he would like to deliver some training around awkward interviewees,
significant statements, points to prove, interviewing techniques, etc.

I’m looking at Team Leaders to nominate those in your teams that would benefit from this piece of activity.
I suggest this is applicable mainly to our recent starters and perhaps those who are relatively
inexperienced or those that Team Leaders feel would benefit.

If you can collate names and let me know, I'll then liaise with Martin for some suitable dates.
Possibly looking at central England again, depending on the names put forward.

Darrell ... we have spoken about this — you indicated excluding Ben and Mark given their experience. You
also mentioned a couple of other training areas that CK may want to include ... can you remind me what
they were?

Regards,
