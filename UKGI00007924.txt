Information Sharing Protocol

BACKGROUND

A. UK Government Investments (UKGI), on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business,
Energy and Industrial Strategy (the Secretary of State), oversees Her Majesty’s
Government’s 100% shareholding in Post Office Limited (POL).

B. POLis the Defendant in the “Post Office Group Litigation”, Bates & Others v. Post Office
Limited, High Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division, Claim No’s HQ16X01238,
HQ17X02637, HQ17X04248 (“Group Litigation”). POL is also assisting the Criminal Cases
Review Commission investigate a number of cases where former Post Office agents
(most of whom are claimants in the Group Litigation) claim to have been wrongly
convicted of a criminal offence prosecuted by POL (the “CCRC Investigations”, together
with the Group Litigation, the “Postmaster Complaints”).

C. The Secretary of State and UKGI share with POL a common interest in understanding the
matters in issue in the Postmaster Complaints, POL’s positon on them, and the
exposures they present to POL’s operations, finances and reputation. This common
interest is based (among other grounds) on the Secretary of State/UKGI’s ownership of
POL, the investment they make in POL’s activities to support the important public and
social purpose POL serves, and the accountabilities the Secretary of State/UKGI have for
that ownership and investment to Parliament and to the public.

D. Consistent with that common interest, POL wishes to share with the Secretary of State
and UKGI information about the Postmaster Complaints. That information may include
material which is confidential and/or covered by legal professional privilege, and it is
expressly agreed by the Secretary of State, UKGI and POL that it is in their common
interest to maintain any and all such confidentiality and privilege.
