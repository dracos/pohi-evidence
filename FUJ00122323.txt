                   WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANNE CHAMBERS




I, ANNE CHAMBERS of Fujitsu Services, Lovelace Road, Bracknell, Berkshire, RG12
8SN WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:


1.   I am a System Specialist employed by Fujitsu.          I have worked for Fujitsu
     (previously ICL) since 1978. I have a working knowledge of the computer system
     known as Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office
     Limited (the Post Office).    For the past 6 years I have been responsible for
     investigation of problems which are, or are suspected to be, caused by software
     or hardware errors anywhere in the Horizon system. I am authorised by Fujitsu
     Services to view extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system and to
     obtain system transaction information from the live Horizon system.


2.   I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless
     otherwise stated.   References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to
     page numbers of Exhibit "AC1" to this Witness Statement.


3.   Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to
     the business of Fujitsu Services. These were compiled during the ordinary course
     of business from information supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be
     supposed to have personal knowledge of the matter dealt with in the information

                                                                                             FUJOO122323
                                                                                           FUJ00122323




     supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the information or cannot be
     traced. As part of my duties, I have access to these records and I have refreshed
     my memory from them.


System Support Centre


4.   Calls from Post Masters relating to potential system problems are initially taken
     and logged by the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). Business issues, which
     include problems with discrepancies when balancing the branch accounts, are
     expected to be handled in the first instance by the National Business Support
     Centre (NBSC), run by the Post Office. If these helpdesks are unable to resolve
     the problem, calls may be passed to the System Support Centre (SSC), the unit in
     which I work. I have access to much more detailed system information than do
     the other units.



SSC investigation



5.   My initial involvement with the investigation was on 26 February 2004, when call
     reference e-0402251077 was assigned to the SSC (pages 14 and 15). The call
     cross-referred several other closed calls being numbers e-0401280325, e-
     0401290358, e-0402130267, e-0402250454, e-0402250553 (pages 1 to 11) and
     so I read those too, to get a better idea of the problems being reported by the
     Marine Drive branch.



6.   I refer to the call log of 18 February 2004, 4.56pm, call reference e-0402251011
     (pages 12 and 13).     This states "Critical event seen @13..00.36 18/02/04 on
     H21333700101" This particular call was raised several days after the event
     occurred.    The Known Error Log entry quoted did not match the specific
     symptoms of this instance. Upon checking further, I found that hundreds of
     branches had had the same event at the same time. The cause had already been
     investigated by another member of the SSC on 18 February 2004 (call reference
     e-0402180803 at pages 5 and 6) and was benign.         The event would not have
     been seen by users at the branches, and in no way affected the branch accounts.



7.   On 26 February 2004, I also checked for any central reconciliation report entries
     for the branch for the previous 2 weeks which might indicate a system problem.
     Various built in checks occur at the end of each day. For example, the gateway
     terminal (i.e. the particular computer at the branch through which data is
     uploaded to the central data centre) will total all the transactions completed on
     both terminals during the day. The total is transmitted to the central data centre




IA_1208412_2                               2
                                                                                               FUJO0122323
                                                                                             FUJO0122323




     and compared with the total transactions received at the data centre from the
     branch, to ensure that all transactions recorded at the branch have reached the
     data centre.   If the gateway terminal is not in communication with the second
     terminal, the totals are not calculated until communications are restored.



8.   Further checks are made when the sub-postmaster has produced the weekly cash
     account at the end of the financial week - normally Wednesday.               The cash
     account lines are produced by processing the entire week's transactions as
     recorded at the branch, the paper copies of the cash account are printed, and the
     electronic copy is sent to the data centre.     Each day, the gateway terminal has
     added up the day's transactions according to where they should appear in the
     cash account, and summarises them at the end of the week. The data centre also
     produces a weekly cash account based on all the transactions received from the
     branch during the week.       There are therefore effectively three weekly cash
     accounts:



     a)   The official branch weekly cash account;

     b)   The branch daily account, summarised at the end of the week; and

     c)   The data centre weekly cash account.



     Any differences between any of these will result in one or more reconciliation
     report entries. Report entries are only produced if there are differences.



9.   I found no reconciliation report entries relating to this branch, indicating that all
     transactions recorded at the branch had reached the data centre and had been
     included in the official branch cash account.      My checks covered at least two
     weeks prior to the investigation, i.e. weeks 47 and 48.



10. I examined the branch messagestore as at 26 February 2004. This contained,
     among other things, all the transactions completed in the previous 34 days, and
     any cash, stamp and stock declarations or adjustments made at the branch.           I
     looked primarily at one of the latest financial weeks - I cannot remember now
     whether I checked week 47 or 48.



11. Cheques were handled correctly as far as the system was concerned. I checked
     the remittance out of the cheques, which is normally done several times a week,
     as the sub-postmaster had reported a problem with this on 10 February (call




IA_1208412_2                                3
                                                                                             FUJOO122323
                                                                                           FUJ00122323




    reference e-0402130267) (pages 3 and 4).        I found that on that one day, the
    cheque listing report was not cut off after the day's cheques had been remmed
    out. "Cut off" involves pressing a button on the system to confirm that you have
    completed processing of the report, so that when the report is next printed, it will
    include only transactions done after the cut-off point. Since the report was not
    cut off, when next printed, it still included the cheques that had already been
    despatched.       I confirmed that the total value of cheques remmed out of the
    system equalled the values of cheques received, and so the failure in process did
    not cause any financial discrepancy.



12. Following up a further point from call reference e-0402130267, I noticed that
    occasionally, when the branch declared the cash held in the office at the end of
    the working day in their overnight cash holding (ONCH) declaration, they did not
    always use the same declaration identification number.       For example if a sub-
    postmaster uses number 01 and enters £10,000 and then changes their number
    and uses 11 to record it elsewhere, the system will think that, at that point, the
    branch has £20,000 whereas it only has £10,000.       I checked to make sure this
    had not been done when they declared the cash at the end of the financial week,
    and it had not.



13. I went through the cash elements of transactions contained in the branch
    messagestore day by day and compared them with the overnight cash
    declarations (ignoring any duplicated declarations as described in paragraph 12
    above). I expected to find that the cash holding declared by the sub-postmaster
    at the end of a day was reasonably close to what he had declared the previous
    day, adjusted by the value of the cash transactions recorded on the system during
    the day. For example, if at the end of day 1 he was holding £50,000 cash, and
    during day 2 recorded transactions showing      £6,000 cash received and £5,000
    cash paid out, the net cash for the day would be £1,000 received, and so the cash
    holding at the end of day 2 should be £51,000. The main reason for making this
    check was to see if I could narrow down the source of the discrepancy to a
    particular day.



14. I was surprised to discover that at the end of each day, the cash the branch
    declared as being in the drawer was tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds
    astray (sometimes higher, sometimes lower) from what they had recorded on or
    had been recorded by the system. This meant that it was possible that the sub-
    postmaster was not accurately recording all transactions on the system at the
    time the cash was physically being put into or taken out of the till . This is not
    necessarily a problem, as long as everything is entered and declared correctly by

                                                                                                                FUJOO122323
                                                                                                              FUJ00122323




       the end of the financial week. However, it does suggest that they are not working
       accurately and it meant I could not link the weekly loss to any particular day.



15. I saw that on 25 February 2004, call reference e-0402250454 (pages 8 and 9) the
       clerk reported that their balancing problem seemed to be related to stock being
       "remmed in" (i .e. entered on the Horizon system) through the week. Accordingly,
       I also looked in particular to see if there could be a problem caused by remming
       in, but I was unable to find anything that suggested that the remming in was
       causing the balancing problem.



Conclusion



16. There was no evidence whatsoever of any system problem, but the continuing
       losses and calls suggested the Marine Drive branch needed some business
       assistance.            I therefore contacted a colleague, Julie Welsh, in Fujitsu Customer
       Services, and asked her to inform Post Office which she did (page 16). I updated
       the call with a summary of my investigation and returned it to HSH, requesting
       they contact the sub-postmaster and explain that we had investigated and the
       discrepancies were caused by the difference between the transactions they had
       recorded on the system and the cash they declared, and were not being caused
       by the software or hardware.



17. I had investigated and examined whether Horizon could have caused the
       discrepancies, either for the specific reasons raised by the Marine Drive branch, or
       for various other reasons.                         I was unable to identify any basis upon which the
        Horizon system could have caused the losses.




I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.
