Version: 3.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 10/05/02

1.0 Introduction

The Network Banking (NWB) report set produced by Fujitsu Services — Pathway (
Pathway) central systems has been designed to enable NWB transactions completed in
the outlets to be reconciled to the outlet Cash Account and settlement to be made with
Post Office Limited (PO Limited) clients, e.g. Link, or direct settlement to specific
clients.

Pathway central systems will produce a suite of reports in accordance with the rules
documented within ‘CS/SPE/011: Network Banking End to End Reconciliation
Reporting’, which reconcile all the individual transaction components making a NWB
transaction. Reconciliation is essentially at two levels, the counter reconciling with the
‘Client’ and the counter reconciling with PO Limited central systems — the Cash
Account.

In addition to those exceptions reported by Pathway within the NWB report set,
reconciliation errors may be discovered by PO Limited when reconciling data within
it’s central systems or relating to queries from PO Limited clients. To initiate the
Business Incident Management Service (BIMS) process, Pathway or PO Limited
Transaction Processing (TP) or Business Service Management (BSM) generates NWB
Business Incidents for one or more exceptions or reconciliation errors discovered.

The incident management process is generic for all services. Electronic Point of Sale
Service (EPOSS), Automated Payment Service (APS) and NWB incidents are raised,
documented and progressed to resolution in the same manner. It should be noted
however, that where a NWB incident DOES NOT affect reconciliation within PO
Limited Transaction Information Processing (TIP), the provisions quoted within the
Codified Agreement (CA) schedule G01, in respect of charges levied for Manual Error
Reports (MER), DO NOT apply. Definition and charges for NWB / Transaction
Processing Service (TPS) related errors, subject to the provisions of CA schedule G01,
where the incident has caused a reconciliation or settlement error within TIP are found
in associated Pathway document: ‘CS/PRO/I11: TPS Reconciliation & Incident
Management’

3.0 Reports produced by Pathway central systems

This section is intended to give an overview of the working of each reconciliation report
available. It is not intended as a reference point in the design of the reports, as such any rules
or definitions quoted within the associated CCD ‘CS/SPE/001: NWB End to End
Reconciliation Reporting’, will take precedence.

3.1. NB101— Network Banking Settlement Statement

This report provides settlement information based upon the ‘Client View’ where C4
transaction components have been received by the DRS.

1

C4 Settlement Date 1 — This figure identifies all C4 transaction components
received by the DRS from the NBE with a ‘C4 Settlement Date’ = to the Run Date
of the report.

C4 Settlement Date 2 — This figure identifies all C4 transaction components
received by the DRS from the NBE with a ‘C4 Settlement Date’ = to the Run Date
of the report minus I day if any C4 transactions received for this date.

C4 Settlement Date 3 etc — This figure identifies all C4 transaction components
received by the DRS from the NBE with a ‘C4 Settlement Date’ = to the Run Date
of the report minus 2 days if any C4 transactions received for this date. (Repeat for
each day where C4 transactions have been received)

Total of all C4 transactions received on this report.

Columns: Representing volume and value of Deposits, (titled ‘Receipts’) and
Withdrawals, (titled ‘Payments’).

Net Settlement column showing volume and value where:
¢ Volume = number of deposits plus number of withdrawals
e Value = value of deposits minus value of withdrawals

e Where the value of withdrawals exceeds the value of deposits, this total is
shown as (£9999.99)

NB102 — Exception Summary

The report identifies all incomplete or exception states.

This report is divided into 12 sections:

Section 1: All Uncleared confirmed, unconfirmed and TIP exceptions

e Reports exceptions by ‘Incomplete or Exception System State’ and reconciliation
date. Where no exceptions are reported for a particular system state, the row is
suppressed.

Section 2: Uncleared exceptioned client transactions

e Reports NBE exceptions, (D), individually listed in system state order and
reconciliation date where the incomplete or exception state suggests an urgent
resolution is required to avoid customer dissatisfaction

Section 3: Uncleared corruption’s

e Reports NBE / DRS corruption’s individually listed in system state order and
reconciliation date.

Section 4: Uncleared timing differences

e Reports transaction components where there is a difference in the reconciliation
date and the posting date allocated where an ‘S’ has been received with an earlier
or later date than the ‘C4’. The ‘C4’ automatically assumes the ‘S’ reconciliation
date however the transaction is exceptioned. NB: For Network Banking, this
section is generally not expected to be populated due to the exclusion of ‘S’ type
transactions from this stream.

Section 5: Uncleared confirmed, unconfirmed and TIP exceptions >24 hrs

e Reports defined uncleared exceptions (see CS/SPE/011) previously included within
Section 1 which have remained uncleared for a period of greater than 24 hours.
They are removed from section 1 and listed individually in system state and
reconciliation date order.

Section 6: Uncleared future dated transactions by client

e Reports any transactions received by the DRS from the NBE which are ‘future
dated’ — Settlement date > report run date +3 in system state and reconciliation
date order.

Section 7: All Cleared confirmed, unconfirmed & TIP exceptions

e As section 1 — exceptions cleared and set to ‘F99’ by Pathway MSU
Section 8: Cleared exceptioned client transactions

e As section 2 — exceptions cleared and set to ‘F99’ by Pathway MSU
Section 9: Cleared corruption’s

e As section 3— exceptions cleared and set to “F99’ by Pathway MSU
Section 10: Cleared timing differences

e As section 4 — exceptions cleared and set to ‘F99’ by Pathway MSU
Section 11: Cleared confirmed, unconfirmed & TIP exceptions >24 hrs

e As section 5 — exceptions cleared and set to ‘F99’ by Pathway MSU

3.3. NB103 — Settled Transaction / Cash Account Reconciliation

Statement

This report allows PO Limited to reconcile the settlement stream against the outlet
Cash Account stream. This reconciliation is required as settlement with the individual
PO Limited clients is based upon ‘C4 Processing Date’ i.e. the business day upon
which the settlement took place. To complete a full reconciliation, it is important to
know which Cash Account the settled transaction was posted to, to enable a
reconciliation of settlement to be made with the outlet records. This report reconciles
the transactions by ‘C4 Processing Date’ and Cash Account record.

1. NB103 is run weekly: In order to align with internal PO Limited / TIP processing it
is required that this report is produced AFTER TPS processing on Friday and
BEFORE TPS processing on Saturday. The report will include all C4 transaction
components where:
© ‘C4 Processing Date’ = run date and,
¢ ‘C4 Processing Date’ = run date minus ‘N’ (where ‘N’ = I to 13).

2. Where a C112 is available and the Cash Account Period (CAP) is known the C4
transaction value will be posted against the appropriate CBDB CAP column.

3. Where a C112 is available and the CAP is known, but there is no C4, it will not be
reflected in this report because the report includes C4 transaction values only

4. Where no C112 is available and therefore the CAP is unknown:

e the C4 transaction value will be posted to ‘No Cash Account Allocated’

e then, when the C112 becomes available, the entry will be deleted from ‘No
Cash Account Allocated’ and posted to the appropriate CBDB CAP column

e  ifno C112 has been received after 14 days, the entry within ‘No Cash
Account Allocated’ will remain until the C112 becomes available even if
this exceeds 14 days

5. If a transaction is posted to the row ‘No C/A to TIP’ (according to rules 2 & 4
above):

e the transaction will remain in this row until the Cash Account has been
delivered to TIP and then move up into the row ‘C/A to TIP’

e  ifno Cash Account has been delivered to TIP after 14 days, the entry within
‘No C/A to TIP’ will remain until the Cash Account is delivered to TIP
even if this exceeds 14 days

6. As the report is run each week, the transactions will move across the report
according to the CAP and the reconciliation date; for example, a transaction posted
to CBDB>=plus 2 in the first week, will move to CBDB plus I the second week
and then appear in CBDB the third week, until disappearing off the report after 14
days

7. Where the columns headed ‘CAPXX’ are referred to, the actual report produced
will show the actual CAP number, for example CBSB CAP40 is quoted, the
column ‘CAPXX<=-2’ will show ‘CAP40<=-2’.

8. This report identifies VALUE only

9. A separate report NB103 will be produced for both Deposit and Withdrawal
transactions derived from ‘Txn_type’”

minus 1, the CBDB <=minus2, the CBDB plus I and the CBDB >= plus 2. In
addition, those settled transactions, which currently have not been allocated a Cash
Account are shown.

The CBDB CAP equates to TWO CAP’s prior to the CAP applicable to the run
date of the report. For example; if the report was run on Saturday 20" January
within CAP42 (CAP 42 commenced on Thursday 17" January), the CBDB CAP
would be CAP40 (CAP 40 commenced on Thursday 3" January, ended
Wednesday 9" January).

. Where the CAP in which the outlet is trading is numerically more than 2 weeks

prior to the CBDB CAP, if this takes the outlet CAP into the previous year, this
will be reported as such. For example; the CBDB CAP is CAP I and the outlet is
trading in CAP 51, this is assumed to be CAPS1 of the previous year, (therefore
CBDB <=minus2) and not reported ahead in the current year.

The C4 processing dates will be shown in reverse chronological order.

For a given C4 Processing Date, the sum of the two Total values (for the two rows
C/A to TIP and No C/A to TIP) should be equal to the Total corresponding
Receipts and Payments value on report NB101 for the same run date

3.4 Report Distribution & Checking

3.4.1

Both daily and weekly reports will be available by 08.00hrs the day following the run
date of the report to:

e PO Limited / TIP gateway: The Host writes the reports to an appropriate
directory. These are picked up by FTMS and posted to the TIP gateway. (As per
other Host to external system applications)

e Pathway / MSU DRS Workstation —- MSU will check each report for mathematical
accuracy only.

All reports will be produced as ASCII text files — one for each report. The report
layout will be fixed format with space characters providing the blank space. This will
allow for ‘Excel’ input, using fixed field width facilities. Any formatting, (lines and
shading) will not be included within the file.

Contingency in the Event on Non delivery of reports to PON

If Pathway is unable to deliver all or any individual report to the PO Limited / TIP
gateway by 08.00hrs the day following the run date of the report, Pathway MSU
Manager will liase with the Network Banking Settlement Team Leader PO Limited /
TP to arrange an e mail transmission via the Pathway account within the PO Limited
corporate mail system of reports NB101_ and NB102 section _1_and_section 2.
Pathway / MSU will operate this contingency under ‘reasonable endeavours’ and will
aim to have the reports with PO Limited by 08.00hrs. However this timescale may not
be achievable if processing problems have also delayed receipt of the reports into the
DRS workstation. Should the PO Limited corporate mail system be unavailable to
Pathway, then ICL Corporate mail is used as an alternative.

NB: Should the corporate e mail service of either organisation be unavailable, the
Manager Pathway / MSU will liase with the Manager PO Limited / TP and agree
facsimile of reports NB101 and NB102 section 1 and 2.

Any distribution list for these reports is considered by both Pathway and PO Limited to

be of a dynamic nature and therefore specific addressees are not covered within this
document.

Incident Classification

NWB Business Incidents

Business Incidents relate to the ‘Symptom’ of an underlying cause — e.g. the effect of
the system fault on the resulting reconciliation or settlement information sent to PO
LIMITED.

A NWB Business Incident relates to one or more of the exceptions reported within the
NWB Report Set, or one or more reconciliation or settlement errors / disputed
transactions raised in accordance with this document by PO Limited / TP / BSM.
(Refer to section 6.0 for a list of those NWB Business Incident incomplete or
exception states currently known and for which appropriate NWB Business Incident
reporting processes are set out in this document).

NWB Reconciliation Report Exceptions

Exceptions reported within the NWB reconciliation report set will be applicable to:

Communication difficulties between the outlet and the Campus
Communication difficulties between the Campus and the NBE
Errors within the NBE

Errors within the DRS

Errors causing TIP transactions not to be harvested
Corruption’s within the NBE / DRS

NWB System Incidents
System Incidents relate to the underlying ‘Cause’

Following the creation of a NWB Business Incident, Pathway may raise an associated
System Incident to identify and repair the underlying cause of a NWB Business
Incident. System Incidents will be routed to the appropriate group within Pathway, for
investigation and resolution.

Where there are associated System Incidents and NWB Business Incidents, their
relationship can be either:

© one to one; or

* one to many, respectively.

4.2 Generation of Business Incidents

4.2.1

4.2.2

In line with the generic incident management PO Limited policy agreed between
Pathway and PO Limited, NWB Business Incidents will only be recognised as such if
generated by Pathway or PO Limited as appropriate, via the HSH or via the ‘Enquiry
Service’. This ensures that the NWB Business Incident is properly logged, enabling
Pathway / MSU to ensure that corrective information can be supplied and any
underlying system fault can be rectified.

It is envisaged that NWB Business Incidents will only be generated by the following
groups within Pathway and PO Limited:

e Pathway / MSU for all exceptions reported via the NWB Report Set

¢ PO Limited TP / BSM for any “Enquiry Based Banking Transactions’ (EBBT) or
‘Disputed Transaction Notice’ (DBTN) discovered by PO Limited that has not been
reported by Fujitsu Services via the NWB report set

e Pathway / System Support Centre (SSC) for any system fault or data ‘surgery’
which is considered by Fujitsu Services to have a reconciliation or settlement
implication within PO Limited in respect of NWB transactions.

Subject to agreement by the parties to the contrary, Post Office outlet calls to the
Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH) will not generate NWB Business Incidents. However
calls from Post Office outlets will be monitored and if it is considered necessary by
Pathway, difficulties reported to the HSH will be elevated to NWB Business Incident
status.

NWB Business Incidents Raised via the HSH by Pathway / MSU

Pathway / MSU will raise an appropriate Business Incident via the HSH for all
exceptions appearing on reconciliation report NB102 sections 2,3,4 and 5.

NWB EBBT Business Incidents Raised via the HSH by PO

Limited
It is important that PO Limited TP / BSM supply sufficient information to the HSH
when generating a NWB Business Incident in respect of an EBBT NWB Business
Incident to ensure the timescales for the resolution of NWB Business Incidents
referred to in section 4.4 can be achieved. Achievement of such timescales is
dependent upon the following information being provided by PO Limitea TP / BSM
when generating a NWB Business Incident via the HSH:

1. A valid ‘PATH’ code must be quoted, e.g. ‘PATH040’ etc.
2. Prefix all narrative with ‘THIS IS A BUSINESS INCIDENT FOR MSU’

NB: Where PO Limited TP / BSM raise an EBBT NWB Business Incident which may
require a large amount of supporting information, summary detail only may be given
to the HSH and the additional information may be sent via e-mail to Fujitsu Services /
MSU. (A current Pathway / MSU contact list will be made available to PO Limited).

4.2.3 DBTN NWB Business Incidents Raised via the Enquiry Service

This facility is to support requirement NBR260 in respect of DBTN where PO Limited
have received notification via either the outlet or the Network Business Support
Centre (NBSC). PO Limited / TP / BSM will contact Pathway / MSU ‘Enquiry
Service’ directly by telephone, requesting urgent investigation within the timescales
quoted in section 4.4.1

Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon the following information being
provided by PO Limited TP / BSM when generating a DBTN enquiry via the Enquiry
Service:
1. A valid ‘PATH’ code must be quoted, e.g. ‘PATH040” etc.
2. The following transaction detail:

e Client Account Number (the PAN)

e Outlet FAD

¢ Value of transaction

¢ Date of transaction

NB: If incorrect or insufficient information is provided by PO Limited Pathway s to
allow resolution of the DBTN enquiry, no further action will take place until new
information is supplied and the enquiry will not be monitored in accordance with the
timescales referred to in section 4.4.1.

NWB Incident Reporting

BIMS Reports / MER

The Business Incident Management System (BIMS) has been designed to report the
progress to resolution of an NWB Business Incident to allow PO Limited / TP to
complete an accurate reconciliation (within PO Limited central systems) or settlement
with their clients. For ease of identification and association with the corresponding
HSH call, BIMS Report references will mimic the HSH reference. However they will
be prefixed with a letter ‘B’, e.g. HSH ref: E9912120011 = BIMS ref.:
BE9912120011. Where an incident has been raised via the Enquiry Service, an initial
response will be provided via telephone to PO Limited / TP / BSM and followed up by
an appropriate BIMS report.

Format & content of BIMS report / MER

ABIMS Report will be issued for each NWB Business Incident generated via the HSH
and the Enquiry Service. As part of that BIMS report, Fujitsu Services will issue a
MER for each error associated with the relevant NWB Business Incident where it is
necessary to do so, to advise PO timitea / TP of the transaction detail required to enable
reconciliation or settlement to take place.

BIMS Reports / MER are designed to notify PO Limited / TP of the detail required to
assist in the reconciliation or settlement process within PO Limited / TP. They
communicate information concerning the resolution of the symptom of an underlying
cause, not the cause itself. BIMS Reports / MER will not advise any detail as to the
underlying ‘Cause’ of the problem if this is a result of a software error etc. This
information is supplied via the System Incident Log (SIL). Where a System Incident is
generated to eradicate the cause of a particular problem and there are one or more
associated NWB Business Incidents, cross-references will be supplied on the NWB
Business Incident BIMS Report / MER and the SIL to allow tracking of the System
Incident.

Clearance & Closure Criteria

Pathway anticipates that it will provide information concerning NWB Business
Incidents to PO Limited / TP on a ‘drip feed’ basis, by issuing updated versions of the
initial BIMS Report / MER.

A BIMS Report is ‘Cleared’ when Fujitsu Services / MSU has provided the
reconciliation / settlement information required to be contained in the relevant BIMS
Report as set out in section 4.4.1.1. Additionally, the exception is cleared from the
appropriate section of NB102 by MSU. The BIMS Report is then ‘Closed’ following
agreement between PO Limited / TP and Pathway / MSU at the monthly TIP
Operational Review Forum (TIPORF). Such agreement is subject only to fulfilment of
the following conditions:

e Ifthere is no associated System Incident, the BIMS Report is closed subject to the
clearance criteria described above being met

4.3.2

e If there is an associated System Incident, the BIMS Report is closed subject to the
successful closure of the System Incident by Pathway / MSU. (On some occasions
however, it is expected that PO Limited / TP will give authority to close a BIMS
report prior to the closure of the System Incident).

PO Limited / TP will advise Pathway / MSU via spreadsheet on a monthly basis at the
monthly TIPORF of any payments it considers are payable to PO Limited (as
compensation for PO Limited’s costs in dealing with MER). For the avoidance of
doubt, NO charges are payable in respect of MER issued for NWB incidents not
affecting the TIP transaction stream.

If the parties disagree whether the TIP transaction stream has been affected or not, this
will be initially discussed at the monthly TIPORF. The specific incidents will then be
escalated via a ‘Case Law Referral’ form, to the Contract Administration Board for a
final decision to be made.

BIMS Report Distribution

Pathway / MSU will distribute NWB BIMS Reports / MER within PO Limited / TP
using the PO Limited corporate e-mail network. In the event that this facility is
temporarily unavailable, reports will be distributed via the Fujitsu Services mail system.

BIMS Reports / MER distributed in accordance with this section will be deemed to
have been issued to PO Limited / TP, and / or PO Limited / TP given notice of any
errors described therein, at the time of transmission by mail.

An example of a BIMS Report / MER is shown in Section 5.0.

System Incident Log

The SIL is intended to track the progress to resolution of a System Incident generated
to eradicate an underlying system fault. In practice, one system fault could lead to a
number of symptoms generating NWB Business Incidents. The SIL has been
developed to remove the need to annotate each BIMS Report / MER associated with a
particular system fault, with the detail required to ensure PO Limited / TP are fully
advised as to the nature of this fault and how and when it is to be rectified. This
information will be contained in the SIL. NB: The SIL is not intended to be a vehicle
to relay detail of all Pathway releases / fixes and will relate only to reconciliation
incidents resolved by MSU.

4.4 NWB Exception Resolution Timescales

4.4.1 NWB Business Incident SLA conditions

Pathway / MSU will raise an initial BIMS Report (V1.0) relating to a new NWB
Business Incident, on the same working day as the NWB Business Incident is
generated via the HSH or the Enquiry Service, or in any event on the morning of the
next working day. This will be made available in accordance with section 4.3.1.1, to
PO Limited / TP. This initial, incomplete, BIMS Report will serve to notify PO
Limited that a NWB Business Incident has occurred and that the completed BIMS
Report will be provided to PO Limited within the agreed timescales below.

In the event of the NWB Report Set not being available to Pathway / MSU in time to
enable any exceptions to be notified within this timescale, Fujitsu Services / MSU will
contact the PO Limited / TP ‘Incident Manager Transaction Processing’ to agree a
temporary extension to the timescale

All enquiries and transaction searches within 90 days of the original transaction date
will be carried out by Pathway / MSU via the DRS Workstation. Enquiries and
transaction searches where the original transaction date is in excess of 90 days will be
carried out by Pathway / MSU using the Audit Archive subject to PO LIMITED
agreement to this archive being used for this purpose.

Pathway / MSU will ensure the final cleared BIMS Report / MER, is made available in
accordance with section 4.3.1.l.and is cleared in accordance with the following
timescales:

1. For DBTN enquiries where the transaction date is within 90 days of the date
the transaction is disputed by the end customer and raised by PO Limited / TP /
BSM via the Enquiry Service in accordance with section 4.2.3:

95% must be resolved within <= 8 hours of notification based upon all DBTN
enquiries (Customer Critical Exceptions) received within the quarterly reporting
period

The following conditions apply to DBTN enquiries:

The calculation of the time to resolution within the above SLA will only commence
from either the receipt of the C4 or D transaction component within the DRS, or
the reporting of a Priority Exception, (which becomes a ‘Customer Critical
Exception by way of the associated DBTN), within NB102 section 5 of the NWB
reconciliation report set.

2. For any DBTN enquiries where the transaction date is in excess of 90 days of
the date the transaction is disputed by the end customer and raised by PO

LIMITED / TP / BSM via the Enquiry Service in accordance with section 4.2.3:
e It must be resolved within 5 MSU days of notification

3. For any ‘Priority’ exception relating to incomplete states 4 or 12, where a DBTN

4.4.1.1

4.4.1.2

enquiry has not been received, reported within NB102 section 5 and raised by
Fujitsu Services / MSU via the HSH in accordance with section 4.2.1:

95% must be resolved within <= 8 hours commencing at 08.00hrs on the
SECOND MSU day following receipt by the DRS of the exception, based upon
all Priority exceptions received within the quarterly reporting period.

For all non ‘Customer Critical’ NWB exceptions reported within NB102 sections
2 —5 and raised via the HSH by Pathway / MSU in accordance with section 4.2.1:

e They must be resolved within 5 MSU days of notification via NB102 sections
2-5.

For EBBT NWB reconciliation errors raised by PO Limited / TP / BSM via the
HSH in accordance with section 4.2.2:

e They must be resolved within 5 MSU days from the date they were reported
to the HSH.

NB: All time is calculated using the MSU day (08.00 to 17.30) and Monday to Friday
inclusive, excluding English bank holidays.

SLA Exclusion / Suspension criteria

Where an exception has been generated due to factors outside of Pathway control,
e.g. where an outlet has failed to communicate due to fire, flooding or other agreed
‘Force Majeur’ conditions, the exception will be removed from the SLA
calculation and resolved using ‘Reasonable Endeavours’.

Where an exception necessitates the retrieval of information from, or access to, an
Outlet to enable successful resolution and this is not available. The period whilst
Pathway waits, having requested that information or access be provided, shall not
count towards the time for resolution of that exception.

Where resolution is dependent upon information being received from the NBE,
The period whilst Pathway waits, having requested that information or access be
provided, shall not count towards the time for resolution of that exception.

PO Limited will be informed via the BIMS report applicable to the exception being
investigated that SLA suspension is being invoked in respect of the above.

NWB System Incident Resolution Timescales

There is no strict timescale for the resolution of a System Incident as the time taken to
develop a fix or correct erroneous reference data cannot be determined. Obviously

however, Pathway will give every System Incident the priority it deserves taking into
account PO Limited’s requirement and would aim to deliver an initial analysis of the
root cause within 5 working days and a final analysis and evidence of remedial action,
within 10 working days. A System Incident will be closed by Pathway once the
relevant fix has been developed and tested, or a correction to the relevant erroneous
reference data has been authorised or approved for release through the appropriate
agreed procedures between Pathway and PO Limited. The SIL, advising the current
status of System Incidents will be delivered to PO Limited / TP at the end of each
week. PO Limited / TP may telephone Pathway / MSU at any time to receive an
update as to the status of any System Incident documented on the SIL.

4.4.2 Widespread Errors

Pathway will monitor ‘trigger points’, for example HSH calls and the NWB Report set,
which can alert of any likely potential or actual ‘widespread’ errors which may occur.

4.4.2.1 Widespread Error Conditions:

Total Number CCE Priority Exceptions which aren’t Other
of Exceptions CCE’s Exceptions
in the day
Up to 100 8 hr SLA 8 hr SLA 5 day target time
100 to 500 8 hr SLA 8 hr SLA unless there are more than I 5 day target time

100 in either state 4 or state 12 in
which case those in that error state
will have a Widespread Error ‘let’ to
5 day target time, but all others to
meet the 8 hr SLA

Over 500 8 hr SLA Target time for Widespread Errors. I 5 day target time

8 hr SLA for the first 500 which are
not Widespread Errors and 5 day
target time thereafter
