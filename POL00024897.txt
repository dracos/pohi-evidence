All

Please see attached ~ I've taken a slightly different approach to this.

I strongly suspect (but don’t know) that Post Office will hold copies of the KEL for non-litigation reasons. I'd be amazed if
FJ hasn't sent extracts to POL previously as part of BAU technical support. On this basis, POL's previous FOI responses
were correct in asserting the commercial interests and law enforcement exemptions. Aliso, we may wish to continue to
reference these exemptions given that not all disclosures of the KEL may be covered by privilege.

This approach aiso has the benefit of avoiding the pain of saying to TM that we were wrong before.

I'm no FO! expert so if this is the wrong approach, please do say.
