0.4.2 Definitions

The following terms, when capitalised as here, have specific meanings as indicated.

transacted onto POL FS accounts will be defined in Reference Data

Branch, however in this document it is purely used to refer to the Horizon
System component

Balancing The process by which a clerk ensures that all the cash and stock for
which they are responsible is correct.

their behalf by a sub-postmaster. In the past the term Outlet was used

Statement during a Trading Period

closing time (in Reference Data) for a Branch or 19:00 whichever is
earlier.

Horizon has a mechanism whereby background processes can be
triggered to operate in the Branch at the End of Day time, for example to
trigger the harvesting of that day’s transactions.

functions can request corrections are made to branch accounts following
various errors. This is to be replaced by Transaction Corrections

0.5 CHANGES IN THIS VERSION

0.5.1 Changes in Version 2.0
Changes from version 1.1 are marked in red (like this) with significant deletions in red-
strikeout-(like-this).

Note that in some places where a section has had major changes I’ve not preserved the
original text to make the new description more readable. Such sections are clearly
marked.

Changes are primarily:

= Incorporation of CPs 3842, 3843, 3844 & 3888

0.5.2 Changes in Version 1.1

This-is- called 4-1 , L Lh L sil beth

Changes from version 1.0 to version 1.1a are marked in red (like this) with significant

deletions in red-strikeout-(ike-this). Changes from Version 1.la are in violet (like
this). Changes from Version 1.1b are in brown (like this).

Note that in some places where a section has had major changes I’ve not preserved the
original text to make the new description more readable. Such sections are clearly
marked.

I have attempted to maintain the sub-section numbers within sections 2.5, Chapter 3
and Chapter 4 to aid traceability from other documents. This may result in some
sections being empty. New sub-sections are added at the end of their parent section to
aid this even if this is not necessarily the most logical place. Note that section 2.6 has
been restructured and in particular the subsections of 2.6.3 have all changed. Note
that Figure numbers and Table numbers may well have changed.

Changes are primarily:

= The breakdown of work between the various HLDs has now been included in
section 1.5
= The excluded interfaces (SAP ADS Transaction Data and CAPO remuneration
data) have been removed from the DP to avoid confusion as to their status
= Migration Terminology has been aligned with that defined in [MIGSTGY].
= Alignment with the lower level documents, ie User Interface Design Proposals,
HLDs and AISs, which are now available. In some cases this has resulted in text
being removed from the DP to avoid duplication.
= Section on LFS Harvester included since it has now been decided to cut-off the
Weekly Stock data in the LFS Harvester to simplify migration
= Details of Post Office Ltd Change Requests and Fujitsu Change Proposals included
as section 8.5
= Some of the more detailed discussion sections have either been removed (if the
subject is now covered in a lower level document) or moved to an appendix within
Chapter 9 (if the discussion may be relevant for future CRs).
0.5.3 Changes in Version 1.0
Changes from version 0.3b to 1.0 are marked in green (like this).

Changes from version 0.2 to version 0.3a are marked in red (like this) with significant
deletions in red-strikeout-(likethis). Changes from 0.3a to 0.3b are in violet (like this).
Note that in some places where a section has had major changes I’ve not preserved the
original text to make the new description more readable. Such sections are clearly
marked.
Changes are primarily:
= The expansion of sections which were previously TBS
= Resolution of issues highlighted in version 0.2
= Alignment with the design that was costed for the CT.
Version 0.3 is being sent on a limited circulation and it is expected that it will be
updated to version 1.0 for baselining shortly.
0.5.5 Changes in Version 0.2
This supersedes various informal issues 0.2a through to 0.2d.

0.6.1 Outstanding Design Issues
A number of areas of in the document require clarification. These are marked in
YeiHOW or BEBBH highlight in this working draft (as indicated):

Wherever possible a working assumption is recorded.
There are also a number of minor comments that require resolving that are made in a
distinctive style like this.
I’ve split such outstanding issues into three lists:
= Issues to be resolved by Post Office Ltd
am _ Issues to be resolved within Fujitsu Services

Introduction

1.1 PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

1.1.1 Accuracy

Fujitsu Services endeavours to ensure that the information contained in this document
is correct but, whilst every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of such information, it
accepts no liability for any loss (however caused) sustained as a result of any error or
omission in the same.

1.1.2 Copyright

© 2004 Fujitsu Services. All rights reserved. No part of this document may be
reproduced, stored or transmitted in any form without the prior written permission of
Fujitsu Services.

1.2 SCOPE OF THE DOCUMENT

1.2.1 Scope

[CDPROG] identified a number of areas for the business proposition of the Impact
programme of which only some will be achieved by the completion of this project.
The business proposition section of [CDPROG] is copied below.

= Interface of data to RMG financial systems (including for data passed to HR SAP)

= Management of PO Ltd Bank Accounts (though this is not a “front end” issue and
so is not covered here)

= Capture, Validation, Verification and Correction of client transaction data from
any channel where applicable

= Provision of validated client transaction data to internal and external recipients
(though some of this is done via POL FS and MI)

= Responding to client/branch enquiries concerning transaction data (Enquiries to
allow response)

= Accounting at branches
= Branch control
= Recovering debt from branches, clients etc (inc non-transaction) debt

This Design Proposal documents the solution design for the Fujitsu Services
components of Impact Release 3.

Fujitsu IMPACT Release 3 Design Proposal Ref.: EA/DPR/004
Services
Version 2.0

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

The Design Proposal has been produced in parallel with the Conceptual Design. The
Conceptual Design (ie requirements) for the overall Impact Programme is defined in
[CDPROG]. The detailed requirements for the projects that make up Release 3 are
described in two separate Conceptual Design documents [CDBT] covering the Branch
perspective and [CDPOLFS] covering the Central perspective.

This Design Proposal is only addressing those requirements defined in [CDBT]. Any
requirements on Fujitsu associated with the Hosting of POL FS (covered in
[CDPOLFS)) will be covered in a separate Design Proposal [SAPDP].

Any requirements on Fujitsu Services that are not fully met by this Design Proposal are
listed in section 1.6.1.

If the Fujitsu Services Commercial Terms for the Solution Build and Test and
Implementation Phases is accepted by Post Office Ltd then the solution delivered by
Fujitsu Services will be based on the outline design defined in this Design Proposal.

1.2.2 Timescales and Phasing

The design contained in this Design Proposal does not link Impact Release 3 to a
particular Horizon release. The release will be determined by the Joint Demand
Planning Forum.

However the expectation is that it will be included in S80.
1.2.3 Potential for Change

There are no specific requirements to allow for future change, however the use of
Reference Data where possible provides a good basis for minimising the developments
required in future to accommodate changes.

It is understood that the data feed to HR SAP (see section 3.2.6) is likely to be
simplified in the future and although that change is out of scope, the design should take
this into account.

1.2.4 Requirements Out of Scope
A number of the Business Processes described in [CDBT] are outside the scope of this

DP. These are listed in Table 4:

Business Process Comment
Perform Transaction Checks — Periodic _I This will be handled by the Post Office MIS system
Summarise Cash Centre Transactions _I This will be handled by SAP ADS as at present

Table 4 — Out of Scope Processes

In addition Section 21 (Appendix C) of [CDBT] identifies a number of changes based
on Schedule 12 savings. These are considered to be outside the scope of this DP.

1.3 REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW

The detailed requirements for Release 3 are described in [CDBT]

Fujitsu IMPACT Release 3 Design Proposal Ref.: EA/DPR/004
Services
Version 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004
A number of further requirements were identified following the baselining of [CDBT],
which have been included in [CT] as Attachment 1.
A number of further Change Requests have been raised by Post Office Ltd and these
are listed in section 8.5.
Some requirements are also defined in [CDPROG], however since these are not
currently aligned with those in [CDBT], they have been ignored in this Design
Proposal.
Chapter 8 provides a formal compliance statement against each requirement in
[CDBT] (section 8.2) and Attachment I of [CT] (section 8.3) with references to where
the way in which the requirement is to be met is described in this document.
A number of assumptions were made at the time [CT] was approved and these are
formally described in Attachments 2 and 3 of [CT]. Section 8.4 is equivalent to
Attachment 2 of [CT] and Section 5.5 reflects the proposal made in Attachment 3 of
[CT].
1.4 DocumENT SUMMARY
[CDBT] split the changes required by Impact Release 3 as far as Horizon is concerned
into a number of areas:
= Verification
= Other Data Capture
= Produce Reports
= Daily Trading
= Produce Branch Accounts
= Stock Control
= Discrepancy Management
= Transaction Management
This document describes the changes that are required to Horizon to meet these
requirements. It is split into a number of chapters:
Chapter Title Comment R
Chapter 2 - This is the bulk of the document
Solution Outline Design and describes all the new and
changed functions that are required
Chapter 3 - This describes new and changed
Data Model interfaces and major data changes
Chapter 4 - This describes the technical aspects
Environmental Constraints of the various interfaces
Chapter 5 - This describes all the non-functional
Non-Functional Requirements —_I requirements including any Service
Level targets
Chapter 6 = This describes requirements on
Testing and Acceptance Testing

Chapter 8 - This is an appendix that formally
Compliance Matrices describes the compliance to the
requirements specified in [CDBT]
and subsequent Change Requests.

Table 5 — Document Structure

1.5 OTHER AFFECTED DOCUMENTS

A number of High Level Design and interface documents are being produced and some
existing documents are being updated from this Design Proposal:

m= [CTRBAL] and [CTRDEC] which covers the counter changes. The split between
these documents is described in section 1.5.1.

= [TPSPOLFS] and [TPSOTHER] which cover those aspects to be included in the
TPS Host. The split between these documents is described in section 1.5.4.

= [TPSDWHAIS] which covers the changes to the interface between the TPS Host
and the POA Data Warehouse

Chapter 2 -
Solution Outline Design

2.1 GENERAL
This chapter provides a definition of the solution being proposed. This is done in the
following ways:

= An overview of the full Impact Release 3 solution is presented including a
breakdown of the components for which Fujitsu Services are responsible

= Changes to the components for which Fujitsu Services are responsible are then
described in more detail, enabling the High Level Designs for these components to
be produced

= Issues to do with Migration and initial start up are covered separately

Interfaces between components (both Internal to Fujitsu Services and External to or
from other service providers) are described in Chapter 3.

2.2 OVERVIEW OF IMPACT RELEASE 3 COMPONENTS

Figure I shows the overall scope of Release 3 of Impact and the components and
interfaces involved.

It should be noted that some of the components are external to the overall system.
These are shown as green boxes in the diagram.
Some of the components / data flows have a suffix of “R2”. This has been done purely
to avoid duplicating objects names within Systems Architect. These suffixes should be
ignored and have not been included in the text in this document.
The components are:
= Prism Systems
This represents the systems provided and operated by the Prism Alliance. The
main components relevant to Fujitsu are:
a Terminals for user access to POL FS (and other systems)
a SAP ADS
o MIS
a Reference Data System
= Horizon Systems
This represents the systems developed and operated by the Fujitsu Services. This
is expanded further in section 2.2.1.
= POLFS
This represents the new Financial System which will replace CBDB. It is being
developed by Prism, but will be operated by Fujitsu Services.
Its design is outside the scope of this document.
= HRSAP
This is a system run by RMG to pay Postmasters. It is fed by summaries of value
and volume of a subset of transactions, which are the basis of the Postmaster’s pay.

2.3 MaJor New END To END CONCEPTS

The purpose of this section is to provide an end-to-end description of new components
that have an effect on multiple components of the proposed solution.

Two such concepts have been identified
= Transaction Corrections
= Reconciliation

These are discussed in the following sub-sections.
2.3.1 Transaction Corrections

This is a new set of business processes to enable corrections to be made to the Branch
accounts as a result of various central investigations. The purpose of this new process
is to replace the existing Error Notice functionality.

The main purpose of this functionality is to enable financial corrections to be made to
the branch position. However it is also possible to adjust stock levels and correct
potential errors in the recording of non-accounting data. Both of these are done by
using the “Stock Write On / Off? Mode. In this Mode a Volume is specified rather
than a Value for the correction. It is not possible to amend both Volume and Value in
a single Transaction Correction.

In summary the process works as follows:

= The central accounting function decides that it is necessary to make some
adjustment to the Branch accounts

= A Transaction Correction is defined which will carry out the necessary changes (ie
the central user will define an amount to be transacted for a given Product in a
given Branch and a corresponding Settlement Product which will normally be Cash
or a defined Suspense Product).

The Transaction Correction will also define a list of possible actions that the
Branch Manager can take and also text to be presented to the Branch Manager
informing him / her of the affect of carrying out any of these actions.

= A daily file of such Transaction Corrections is generated from POL FS and passed
to Horizon overnight

= Horizon host systems need to receive this file and send messages using Riposte to
the specified Branches with details of the Transaction Correction. This will use
normal Bulk Loader technology including the use of Acks from the Branch to
acknowledge successful receipt of the Transaction Correction which can be
reported on as with any other in-bound file delivery. (See section 2.5.2.12 for
more details.)

= In order to alert Branch Management of the receipt of Transaction Corrections a
new check is included at Logon for roles MANAGER and SUPERVISOR as to

whether there are any Outstanding Transaction Corrections and if so the user is
informed of the number currently outstanding and given the option of processing
them. (See section 2.5.1.6 for more details.)

= A new Transaction Correction Button is provided to enable the Branch Manager /
Supervisor to view and process Outstanding Transaction Corrections. (See
section 2.5.1.7 for more details)

= The result of processing a Transaction Correction will normally be the creation of
the specified Transactions, which will be returned to POL FS as part of the normal
flow of Summarised Transaction data at the end of the Trading Day on which the
Transaction Correction was processed at the Branch.

= An additional check is made as part of the Branch Balancing Process to ensure that
there are no Outstanding Transaction Corrections. This ensures that Transaction
Corrections cannot be ignored indefinitely. (See section 2.5.1.4.1 for more
details.)

As far as the processing of Transaction Corrections is concerned, the Host
functionality is very similar to that for Replenishment Deliveries (introduced at Impact
Release 1), in that a single message is written to Riposte for the appropriate Branch for
each Transaction Correction.

When a Transaction Correction is processed, a message is written at the Branch, thus
enabling a Branch to scan all Transaction Corrections and any Transaction Correction
Processed messages, and thus easily identify any that are Outstanding. This is the same
as the logic currently used to handle LFS messages.

In order to keep things simple at the Branch, it is proposed that Transaction
Corrections include the <WAIndex.LFSFlag:> attribute with new values for
Transaction Corrections and Processed Transaction Corrections. (See [CTRDEC].)

2.3.2 Reconciliation

In general, reconciliation is unchanged, however there are currently some places where
there is reconciliation against the Cash Account and in general these reconciliation
checks are to be removed rather than being changed to reconcile against anything else.
The following summarises the reconciliation changes:

= APS Reconciliation
This is totally unchanged. Currently there are three aspects to this:

co Reconciliation of AP Transactions at the counter against those harvested to the
APS Host

o Reconciliation of AP Transactions sent to clients against those available in TPS

co Reconciliation of the AP Transactions sent to clients against the Client
Summaries

= DRS Reconciliation

This is unchanged to a large extent. The only change is that the reconciliation of
DRS transactions against the Cash Account information that has been sent to Post

Office Ltd (covered by the NB103 report) is removed at the time that the OPTIP
interface is removed. This is discussed further in section 2.5.2.5
= EPOSS Reconciliation with TPS.
Currently there are 3 aspects to this:
o Reconciliation of the total value and volume of transactions that take place at
the counter against those passed to OPTIP.
o Reconciliation of the daily transactions at the counter against the cash account
as checked at the counter.
o Reconciliation of the daily transactions in the Host against the cash account.
The first check will remain (though it will be reconciled against the transactions
being passed to POL MIS rather than to OPTIP since POL MIS is in effect
replacing OPTIP). The other two checks will be removed since the cash account
will no longer be available. The changes are discussed further in sections 2.5.1.5.5
and 2.5.2.14.
It should be noted, that strictly the reconciliation should be changed to reconcile
against the POL FS feed rather than the POL MIS feed, however such a change
would introduce a number of complications:
co The detailed transactions passed to POL FS and POL MIS are not quite the
same, and so there would be migration issues in co-ordinating the changes to
the counter calculation of the reconciliation totals to align with the POL FS
data rather than the POL MIS data
a The transactions passed to POL FS are already checked as having a net value
of zero, which should be sufficient to identify any missing transactions.
Therefore it is proposed that no change is made and that we continue to reconcile
the counter transactions against the POL MIS feed. This approach has been
discussed with the Horizon operational support staff and they support this.
2.4 UNCHANGED PROCESSES

change. These are listed in Table 16:

Table 16 — Unchanged Processes

2.5 CHANGED COMPONENTS

2.5.1 Counter Components

2.5.1.1 Branch Transactions

There are a number of aspects to this:

= Extending Transaction Retention

= Stock to be handled by Volume rather than by Value
= Merging of Value and Non-Value Stock

= Changes to Suspense Products

= Change APS to use EPOSS Core

= Settlement Transactions

= Reversal Control

These are discussed further below

2.5.1.1.1 Extending Transaction Retention

This is a new requirement and wasn’t included in the March 2003 costings.

It doesn’t directly support a Business function, but more the non-functional requirements and
the move to a monthly reporting period.

The move from a one week Cash Account period to a monthly Trading Period means
that transactional data will need to be retained in the branch for a minimum of 42 days
rather than the current 35 days. [BT049, BT050]

POL would prefer longer, but 42 days is thought to be the best we can offer without upgrading
the Correspondence Server Disk storage. Disk storage at the counter is considered not to be
an issue.

There are a number of aspects to this:
= Changes to Riposte configuration parameters and the migration implications

= Changes to applications in the way that they specify the Expiry of Riposte
messages

= Analysis of “unnecessary messages” and their removal

= Protection against lost data at system start

= Protection against lost data at EOD (see section 2.5.1.5.6)
= Protection against lost data at Logon (see section 2.5.1.6.4)

Some of these topics are covered elsewhere in the DP (as indicated), the remaining
ones are covered in the following subsections

2.5.1.1.1.1  Riposte Configuration Parameters
The Riposte configuration is documented in three separate documents:
= Counters [RIPCNT]
= Correspondence Servers [RIPCS]
= Other platforms [RIPDC]

These documents will be updated to reflect the detailed configuration changes
following detailed design. The main change is to MaxMessageExpiry to allow
messages to be retained for longer, however there are some messages whose retention
could be reduced in the branch given that we are committed to recover any non-polled
branch by Day J. Feedback suggests that this is probably too risky so
MinMessageExpiry will remain at 34 days.

Riposte is currently configured as follows:

Platform Config Param Current Value _I New Value
Correspondence Server & Clients_I MinMessageExpiry 10 10
Counter MinMessageExpiry 34 346
Correspondence Server & Clients _I MaxMessageExpiry 37 50
Counter MaxMessageExpiry 37 50
Correspondence Server & Clients I DefaultMessageExpiry I 36 43
Counter DefaultMessageExpiry I 36 43

Table 17 — Riposte Configuration Changes

Making these changes will require some other Riposte Configuration parameters to be
changed in line, however the details will be covered in the Riposte Configuration
documents [RIPCNT], [RIPCS] and [RIPDC] rather than here.

2.5.1.1.1.2_ Changes to the Expiry of Riposte messages

The main EPOSS messages are explicitly written with an Expiry value of 35 days.
These need to be changed to 42 days. This value should be defined in a Type C
Reference Data Object, thus allowing the exact value to be easily tuned in future.

In some cases we may decide to just change the Expiry to the default value
This is defined in [CTRBAL].

2.5.1.1.1.3 Analysis of “unnecessary messages” and their removal

A quick analysis of a live counter shows the following Expiry Values

Table 18 - Expiry Value Analysis

Two separate exercises have been carried out:

= Set the Riposte Configuration values as specified in Table 17 and run a counter
with a complete mixture of transactions and look to see what the Expiry values
become for various types of message. Need to consider any that do not have a
value of 34, 35 or 43, since that would mean that these are being explicitly set to
that value. No such messages have been identified.

= Analysis of those messages with a current Expiry value of 35 or 36 to see if it can
be sensibly changed. Specific types of message that could be considered for
reducing the Expiry value are:

o LPOs

a Some LFS Messages (ie those containing <WAIndex:>)

o Print messages

co EOD Reconciliation messages (though many of these are likely to be removed)

The output of this analysis will be a series of proposals for further changes to the
Expiry Values of specific messages which should then be included with those changes
identified in section 2.5.1.1.1.2.

This is covered in [CTRBAL].

2.5.1.1.1.4 Protection against lost data at system start

One of the major risks associated with increasing the Trading Period to 4 or 5 weeks is
that there is a significantly reduced margin for error should a branch not change its
Trading Period at the correct time. Currently there is a one week Cash Account
Period (which exceptionally can be extended to 3 weeks) and data is retained for 35
days, thus having a minimum safety factor of 2 weeks and a normal safety factor of 4
weeks before data relevant to the current trading period is lost. With the revised 4 / 5
week Trading Period and 42 days Transaction Retention, the safety factor has been
reduced to 2 weeks normally and only one week if there is a 5 week Trading Period.

Given the way in which the counter is currently engineered means that all local
reporting will fail and the ability to carry forward data into a new period will fail if the
data recorded at the start of a period is no longer available. Therefore, it is essential
that measures are introduced to ensure that the chances of losing data associated with
the current Trading Period are minimised. It is expected that there may still be some
obscure circumstances under which the data is lost, and the only option in such cases
will be to Temporarily Close the branch and reopen it as a “new branch” as is currently
done for long term temporary closures. Such a closure must be for a minimum of 15
days currently and no work is being done to reduce that as part of Impact R3.

The main measure to be undertaken to protect against data loss is a set of checks at
End Of Day. These are described in section 2.5.1.5.6. However these checks do not
protect against the case where all the counters in a Branch are switched off for a
period, thus preventing the EOD checks from being carried out. A simple mechanism
to handle this scenario is to carry out a check as part of the initial counter load
sequence, namely how long has the counter been switched off. If this is more than a
day (24 hours), then the assumption should be that the data on the counter may be

vulnerable and so the Riposte Configuration parameter DisableArchiving must be set
to 1 (through the registry) before starting the Riposte Service. The EOD checks will
ensure that this is reset back to 0 once it is safe to do so. [BT115] In particular, if this
is a new counter (ie a box swap) then DisableArchiving will be set to I as part of the
cold build.

Although 1 day is possibly a bit aggressive, with only 7 days between a “normal” 5 week
Trading Period and losing data, I believe that this is necessary. However the time should be
configurable (via the registry) to allow subsequent tuning.

2.5.1.1.2 Stock to be handled by Volume rather than by Value

This is a new requirement and wasn't included in the March 2003 costings.

It doesn’t directly support a Business process.

This has a number of implications: [BT056]
= Stock Remittance / Transfer
= Stock Declaration / Adjustment (see section 2.5.1.2.4)
= Stock Sales
= Stock Unit Balancing (see section 2.5.1.4.1)
= Stock Reporting (see section 2.5.1.3.7)
= Stock Revaluation
= Exceptional Products
Some of these topics are covered elsewhere in the DP (as indicated), the remaining
ones are covered in the following subsections.
2.5.1.1.2.1_ Stock Remittance / Transfer
This supports part of the Business Process Rem In/Out Stock.

In general, Stock Remittances and Transfers are carried out by volume. There are
some exceptions to this and these are discussed in section 2.5.1.1.2.4. However when
the remittances / transfer transactions are recorded, then the stock values are recorded.
This should be changed such that a value of zero is recorded.

This may require changes to the Transaction validation function for Fixed priced
products.

A new flag will be required in product Reference Data to identify a stock Product as
being handled by Volume rather than by Value and this should be used for controlling
this change. (See also section 3.5.)

This in turn means that when the Remittance / Transfer session completes, there will be
a net value of zero on the stack, and so strictly there would be no need for a settlement
transaction. However, a zero-value settlement transaction will be recorded since some
reporting is against the Settlement Product.

Services
Version 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

A consequence of this is that there will be no value for the overall Remittance /
Transfer session and so this will mean that the Remittance / Transfer reports will
change. This is covered further in section 2.5.1.3.7.

2.5.1.1.2.2 Stock Sales

A concept of Tertiary Mappings is introduced for stock products (see
section 2.5.1.4.1.3) in order to support the production of the Stock Unit Balance
Report. All Volume Stock Transactions (beth-steck-and—nen-steck} may need to
include these Tertiary Mappings where they exist in addition to the current Primary /
Secondary Mappings, if dependant-zpon the Mode of the Transaction incurs a value
movement (ie SaleValue is not zero).

This is a change to EPOSSCore and so is not specific to stock.

2.5.1.1.2.3 Stock Revaluation
This supports part of the Business Process Stock Revaluation.

A consequence of holding stock by volume rather than by value (and the business
reason for doing it) is that revaluation is no longer required as a branch accounting
function. However the current mechanism of reporting imminent product revaluations
is still required to ensure that stock levels are adjusted correctly prior to the
revaluation and that staff are fully aware of the new prices. [BT046] However the
functionality to support revaluation of Stock Levels will no longer be required and so
can be removed. (ie the button will become invisible at the appropriate point in
migration)

2.5.1.1.2.4 Exceptional Products

“Other Stamps” have a special problem since they can’t easily be managed by Volume.
Therefore they will continue to be managed by Value and so still appear as part of the
Stock Unit Balance (together with Cash, Cheques and Foreign Currency)

In particular any Non Value Indicator stamps (in particular the 38p Europe stamp)
should be removed from the list of “stamps” on the Declare Stamps and Postage
Stamps Remittance menus and no longer be transacted as Postage Stamps (F3 on the
main Serve Customer menu) and appear as a separate menu item. This will enable
them to be held by volume and thus avoid any future revaluation. Note that there is a
requirement on Post Office Ltd ([BT047]) to make this change.

This can be handled via normal OBC and should take place prior to S80. NB there is a
suggestion that Euro stamps are to be withdrawn which would also solve this problem

This should be a simple Reference Data change.

Table 21 (in section 2.5.1.2.4) identifies other products that are likely to present a
similar problem. All these products should continue to be managed by Value and so
have their mapping set appropriately and appear in reports as at present.

It is assumed that all of these exception products are removed.

However our current design will handle such products sensibly (other than not revaluing them).

2.5.1.1.3 Merging of Value and Non-Value Stock

This is a new requirement and wasn’t included in the March 2003 costings.

It doesn’t directly support a Business function,

There are a number of requirements in terms of how Stock is to be handled in future.
BT055]

No changes are currently proposed in this area other than removing the non-value stock
functions.

The following discussion is included for information and we anticipate receiving a CR from
POL to request further work in this area. The CR is 3813. Now approved for S90.

They can best be summarised as removing the distinction between Value and Non-
Value stock.

Currently, the only purpose of Horizon taking note of non-value stock is for the
weekly stock report to SAP ADS. This will be removed (see section 2.5.1.5).

Having done that, any current non-value stock products can be “retired” in the normal
way and removed from the system. Since it is understood that the weekly stock report
is not actually used by SAP ADS, there is no need to wait until the interface is
removed before starting to remove non-value stock from the system.

Further analysis is required by Post Office Ltd as to what should happen to these non-
value stock products. The following are the options:

= Do Nothing

= Change the transactions that are currently undertaken which use the non-value
stock to become Value Stock transactions.

= Re-engineer the transactions to better exploit Horizon functionality

Since there are no specific requirements on this in [CDBT], our current costings
assume that Post Office Ltd will choose “do nothing” in all cases or-raise-suitable-CRs.

Further analysis has been carried out and this is included in section 9.2.

2.5.1.1.4 Changes to Suspense Products

This is a new requirement and wasn't included in the March 2003 costings.

This supports part of the Business Process Make Good or Declare any Outstanding
Losses.

There are currently a number of Products and Buttons that relate to the Suspense
account. For each line on the suspense account there are 2 associated products:

= One to post the item to the Suspense Account
= One to clear the item from the Suspense Account

Most of these are invoked by Buttons or picklists on or below the Housekeeping
menu. The following changes are required:

The concept of “emergency suspense” is an operational workaround for when one or more
branches has incorrect Reference Data. In such cases, the process that they are asked to follow

by the NBSC is to record the transaction against a suspense account (eg Cash Surpluses C) and
when the Reference Data is corrected to reverse the transaction and record the correct
transaction.

There are two aspects of this:

+ If the “emergency suspense” products are still required, then we need to keep the buttons for them (or
introduce new ones)

+ If they are to continue to be “Suspense” products, does that mean we have to leave full access to the
Housekeeping Menu?

[Any changes here will be done using the OCP process

= All of the Suspense Account Products are to be restricted to those Roles who can
do an Office Balance (ie Manager, Supervisor, Migrate, Auditor and Auditor -
Emergency Manager). [BT040a]

This will be controlled using normal Menu Security functionality on the
Housekeeping menu.

= The list of Suspense Account products needs to be rationalised. Some additional
products are required and some existing products may no longer be required. In
particular some of the products may become non-core. [BT 102]

Branch Consumables and Corporate Customers have been introduced as new
Housekeeping categories. It is assumed that normal Pick List mechanism can be
used to define the exact products to be included in these categories and that the
introduction of such products will be handled using the OBC process.

These names are likely to change, however the concept will not. It is anticipated that such
changes will be handled as a result of normal OBC change.

Note that Products cannot be removed if there is still a balance associated with
them. This means that in practice it is unlikely that any Suspense products will
actually be removed, however the buttons that enable the Suspense products to be
used will be removed. Business processes will then ensure that Transaction
Corrections are used to clear out the balance from these Suspense products.

= Need to introduce a new “Local Suspense Account”. This is also linked to the
Stock Unit Balancing Process (see section 2.5.1.4.1). [BT 102]

= The buttons that allow Error Notices to be cleared and Vouchers to be processed
need to be removed, since in the future this will be achieved using Transaction
Corrections. [BT 103]

This can all be implemented via Reference Data Changes

The detailed changes are specified in [DIAGBAL].
Section 9.3 contains details of the current suspense products.
2.5.1.1.5 Change APS to use EPOSS Core

The APS application needs to be changed to call EPOSS Core thus enabling it to pick
up other changes associated with Stock Products and Tertiary mappings.

2.5.1.1.6 Settlement Transactions

Currently, we have a number of “special products” with Product Ids in the range
10,000 to 13,000 which are managed by Fujitsu and do not come from POL as Type A
Reference Data.

Historically these products are of no interest to POL and in particular are not passed to
OPTIP. In general this is achieved by suppressing such products in either the TPS
Harvester or in the TPS Host (or in many cases both!).

However with the introduction of Impact, some of these products are relevant to POL
FS, namely the Remittance Settlement Products for Cash and ForEx. At Impact R1
these are picked up at the branch as part of the EOD Summarisation process and
harvested as part of the POL FS feed into the TPS Host. However at Impact R3, since
summarisation of transactions for POL FS is done in TPS, all such transactions will
need to be harvested otherwise the data passed to POL FS may not balance and data
will be lost.

The following table shows the types of products affected with approximate numbers:

Product Numbers I Category Comment

10639 & 10990 Revaluations These appear to be historic and can no longer be
transacted.

11212 & 11213 Revaluations Currently used for revaluations.

Will still be required to support ForEx revaluations.

11101 Adjustment This relates to staff discounts and has never been turned-
on in live. Since the system has moved-on since
implementation, then I would suggest that it would be
risky to turn this functionality on without rechecking the
code (le: would require a CP).

Therefore suggest this product is removed.

11200 & 11201 Transfers Settlement Products for Transfers between Stock Units
11202 — 11211; Rems Settlement Products for various modes of Remittance
11215 & 11216 NB some are no longer used (Modes now redundant)
plus others at S60
11214 Parcel Traffic Settlement Product for Parcel Traffic sessions
11217 - 11299 Rems New Settlement Products introduced at S60 or later
11300 - 11401 Scales No longer used

11999 - 12002 BES No longer used

Table 19 — Current Settlement Products

There are two approaches to this that could be considered:

= That we continue using the existing Settlement Products, but ensure that they are
harvested to TPS so that they can be used for Transaction Summarisation, but are
suppressed in the feed to OPTIP. We would need to consider separately whether
or not they should be passed to POL MIS.

= That we pass control of these products back to nRDS since they need to be aware
of those used for summarisation to POL FS. This will probably result in them
having new Product Ids (presumably in the 5000 or 6000 range), which in turn will
require changes to some of the Type C Ref Data to use the new products.

It has been agreed that we take the second approach. In particular, transactions
involving such products must not be sent to MIS and so the product Reference Data

needs to identify such products to enable them to be easily suppressed by the TPS Host
system.

The proposed approach is to request that nRDS delivers replacements for the
Settlement Products that we expect to be used and we then withdraw all the 1xxxx
equivalent products following migration. There are migration issues and these are
discussed in section 2.6.3.2.4.

2.5.1.1.7 Reversal Control

This section has been added as a result of a question from ITU concerning the ability to
Reverse Transaction Corrections.

An additional check is required in the handling of Existing Reversals, based on the
Mode of the original transaction. In order to support this check a new flag is required
in the ModeParameters to indicate if Existing Reversals are supported for Transactions
originally carried out in a given Mode.

It should be noted that there are already a number of specific checks done for an
existing reversal, some of which are already based on the mode of the original
transaction. Consideration should be given to removing such checks to utilise the
generic mechanism.

There are no User Interface implications with such a check, since there are already
checks in place as to which Transactions can be reversed and the same mechanism will
be used to inform the user that such transactions cannot be reversed.

2.5.1.2 Changes to Cash / Stock declarations and handling of variances

This is a new requirement and wasn’t included in the March 2003 costings.

Again, there are a number of aspects to this:
= Changes to Cash Declarations

= Reporting of Cash Variances

= Processing of Cash Variances

= Stock Declarations and Variances

= Non-Value Stock Declarations

These are discussed further below.

2.5.1.2.1 Changes to Cash Declarations

This supports the Business Process Compare Generated with Actual Cash Held for
Stock Unit.

Currently there are separate functions for a Cash Declaration (on the Stock Balancing
menu) and ONCH Declaration (on the reporting menu). Both have similar dialogues
with the branch office staff and record similar information within the message store. It
is required that the ONCH declaration be removed and replaced by a Daily Cash
Declaration. [BT 104]

Services
Version 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

For ease of transition, the Cash Declaration Button will also be placed on the
Reporting menu.

The dialogue of the Cash Declaration function will be basically unchanged.

The detailed dialogues for the current Cash Declarations and ONCH Declarations have
subtle differences. In all cases the Cash Declaration dialogue will be followed rather
than that for ONCH Declaration dialogue.

In particular, what this means is:
= Shared Stock Unit
When a declaration is requested:

co The user is presented with a list of the latest declaration for all Declaration Ids
that currently exist. They also have the option of "New Declaration" (and this
will be the only option if there are no existing declarations)

co The previous declaration is presented for updating (for a New Declaration this
will have zero for everything)

o When they complete the declaration it will be stored so as to over-write the
previous declaration for that Declaration Id. If they had selected "New
Declaration" they will be invited to enter the Declaration Id and will be warned
if this will result in over-writing an existing declaration with that Declaration Id

At desktop start-up, any zero value Declaration Ids which have a current value of
zero and “Make Good” amount of zero will be removed such that they are no
longer available. This is the only way to remove a declaration Id from the list
presented (ie Declare it with a zero value and wait until the next day).

= Unshared Stock Unit
When a declaration is requested:
co The previous declaration is presented for updating.

co When they complete the declaration it will be stored so as to over-write the
previous declaration (if any)

This has a number of implications:

= Normally for a Daily Cash Declarations, the user will have to update the previous

’’s declaration. This will mean having to clear out yesterday's figure before
in today's figures. For a Shared Stock Unit this can be avoided by always
choosing "New Declaration" and selecting the Declaration Id after the Declaration
and saying "OK" when asked if the old one is to be over-written. There is no
similar avoidance for Unshared Stock Units

In order to support subsequent reporting, details of cash declarations made need to be
held in a set of Persistent Objects similar to those currently used to hold details of
ONCH Declarations. These are described in section 2.5.1.2.1.3. The denominational
level information will continue to be maintained in Declaration messages.

For an Unshared Stock Unit, any difference between the declared figure and the
systems generated figure will be presented to the user and will be recorded (as a
discrepancy — but now to be called a variance) as part of the Declaration event.

FUJ00090393
Fujitsu IMPACT Release 3 Design Proposal Ref.: EA/DPR/004
Services
Version 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

For a Shared Stock Unit, a new function, Check for Variances, is required to check for
Cash Variances across all declarations within the stock unit. This is described in
section 2.5.1.2.1.1.

In addition, an extra button is added into the “Produce Report” screen at the end of a
Cash Declaration in a Shared Stock Unit, giving the user the option of going straight
into this new “Check for Variances” function. [BT026]

2.5.1.2.1.1 I Check for Variances Function

The Check for Variances function will present a list of declarations for that stock unit
with different Declaration Ids and then compare the total declared position against the
system derived figure and again any differences will be recorded (as a variance) as part
of the appropriate event. [BT105]

The rules for picking those Declarations Ids to be presented as part of the Check
Variances function are the same as those currently used by the Stock Unit Balance
Process. The processing required is:

1) Find the latest Declaration Persistent Objects for each Declaration Id that has
been used within the current Stock Unit

Note that the current selection of Declarations restricts the choice to those Declarations made
since the last BP rollover. It is proposed that no such restriction is made here or elsewhere
where Declarations are selected for display.

2) For each Declaration Id being displayed need to include the following:
¢ Declaration Id
e User
¢ Date and Time of Declaration
© Node

3) The user has the option of abandoning the function if they are not happy with
the list presented. This can be achieved by use of the Prev or Home buttons.
There is no need to explicitly request confirmation. The list will be displayed
as a picklist (as for the current list displayed as part of SU Balancing)

4) If the user selects Continue, the current stock unit derived position is
calculated and compared with the sum of the declarations selected.

5) If they match, then a Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete event is
written; the Stock Unit Variance Persistent Object is updated; and the function
exits having confirmed to the user that there is no variance

6) If they do not match, then a Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete with
Discrepancy event is written; the Stock Unit Variance Persistent Object is
updated; and the function exits having informed the user that there is a variance
and what it is

Note that there is no requirement to produce a report at this stage. All the relevant
information can be found on the Variance Report.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

It should be noted, that no attempt will be made to check or to take into account any
transactions that may have taken place between the times the various declarations were
made and the time that the Variance is calculated.

This is no different from the current “Discrepancies” function.

Two new events are required for this:
a Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete
m Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete with Discrepancy

Note that if other users attached to the Stock Unit have continued trading since they
made their Declarations, then the Variance that is calculated is likely to be incorrect.
No attempt should be made to compensate for this. It is the responsibility of the
Branch staff to ensure that no such trading takes place. This is why a list of when the
last Cash Declarations were made for each declaration Id is required to assist in
monitoring this.

This function can optionally be selected at the end of the Cash Declaration process, so
that the branch office staff can move into it directly if they know that all Cash
Declarations have already been made for that Stock Unit.

2.5.1.2.1.2 Declaration Events

In order to simplify subsequent processing of Variances, then it is necessary to change
the way in which the Declaration event is recorded.

There are 3 events currently associated with Declaration:
= Declaration Complete (Event Id 21)

This is used when a declaration has completed with no discrepancy or where it is
not possible to check if there is a discrepancy (eg in a Shared SU)

In this case the event message includes information about the value that was
declared

= Declaration Abandoned (Event Id 22)

I've tried to generate this event and have failed. I suspect it can't happen.

It is now confirmed that although the code supports the generation of this event, it is not
possible to get to this bit of code. It can be ignored as far as this DP is concerned.

= Declaration Complete with Discrepancy (Event Id 23)

This is used when a declaration has completed and it has been detected that there is
a discrepancy from the systems derived figure.

In this case the event message includes information about the value that was
declared and the amount of the discrepancy

In addition two new events have been identified above:
= Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete (Event Id 63)
= Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete with Discrepancy (Event Id 64)

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

These new events will need to be defined in Type C Reference Data. Also a new
mechanism will need to be introduced to indicate that the shared stock unit
declarations have been completed.

These events will be classified as Balancing Events and SU Balancing Events and those
indicating a discrepancy (ie Event Ids 23 and 64) will contain a variable Parameter
<P4>>-containing the amount of the Discrepancy. This amount will be held as a signed
amount — positive indicating a gain and negative a loss.

2.5.1.2.1.3 Variance Persistent Objects

In order to support the production of the Variance report (defined in section 2.5.1.2.2)
the following Persistent Objects are required:

= One for each week for each Stock Unit (shared or unshared)
= One for each week for each Declaration Id in each Shared Stock Unit

= One for each week for the Office

Old Persistent Objects should belogically-deletedwt y

2.5.1.2.2 Reporting of Cash Variances

This supports the Business Process Create Variance Report ... Compare Generated
with Actual Cash Held Across Branch.

A report is required to show the variances for all Stock Units in the branch and also
indicate what when-theast-declarations have been made was-dene-for each Stock
Unit.

This is a new Office Daily Report which is generally available.

It is assumed that a new button is added into the Reports Menu at some appropriate
place (probably as an Office Daily Report)

The processing when the button is touched is as follows: [BT009]
1) The normal “Produce Report” screen is displayed

2) The Report tablet will include “Trading Period” and the current week

3) All the Stock Unit Variance Persistent Objects for this week are found (of all
types)
NB if it is a Thursday, then the report is done on last weeks data and last
week’s Variance Persistent Objects are used instead.

4) The report is then produced.

Details of the report layout are in [DIAGDEC] and the way in which it is
produced is defined in [CTRDEC].

The report is defined as providing data up to and including “yesterday”. Since much of
the report is prepared as part of the EOD process, then should the EOD process not
run for some reason (eg one of the counters is broken), then data for those days which
have not run the EOD process will be missing.

It should be noted, that immediately after migrating to the Impact R3 functionality,
there will be a very limited history of Variance Persistent Objects. Any data that is
required by the report, which is not available in the Variance Persistent Objects, should

be treated as if no declarations were made on that day and “x”s output.

Special handling is required for Stock Units that have been Created or Deleted during
the time covered by the report. The rules are as follows:

= Reporting for these Stock Units should be as above for the periods when the Stock
Units were in existence

= For those periods when the Stock Units were not in existence, then the various
columns should have a value of “n/a” rather than “x”, and the Stock Units should
be ignored in terms of deciding if totals should be included. In the case of deleted
Stock Units, this may not change until the next week, however the value in such
Stock Units must be zero (it is not possible to delete a Stock Unit that has any
value in it or has carried out any Transactions in the current accounting period)

2.5.1.2.2.1 Reprints of the Cash Variance Report

This report is produced from the raw data in a similar manner to the production of the
Cash Variance report as described above. The difference is that the date range for
which the report is to be produced is defined as part of the reprint mechanism and the
Variance Persistent Objects for that period are used rather than those for the current
week. [BT060a]

2.5.1.2.3 Processing of Cash Variances
This supports the Business Process Make Good, Hold or Declare Any Cash Variance.

The Cash Declaration process may result in Variances being identified between the
Declared Cash values and the System Generated values. Such variances can either be:

= Held (ie ignored for now in the expectation that they will resolve themselves)

m Made Good (ie the physical cash will be adjusted to match the System Generated
figure)

Fujitsu IMPACT Release 3 Design Proposal Ref.: EA/DPR/004
Services
Version 2.0

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

= Recording the variance as a Discrepancy (ie the System Generated figure will be
adjusted to match the physical cash by creating a transaction which is balanced
against the Discrepancy product)

This is current functionality and will continue to be invoked only as part of the
Stock Unit balancing process. This is covered further in section 2.5.1.4.1.

Making good a loss (or removing excess cash), has no actual affect on the system
generated figures since what is being done is adjusting the actual cash holding to
reflect what the system thinks it to be. This can be thought of as making an update to
the last Cash Declaration recorded in the system.

There is also a requirement to make any such event explicitly visible, so that if an issue
subsequently comes to light there is some evidence that there had been a variance
within the system. [BT032]

Therefore two new “buttons” are introduced in the Stock Balancing Menu:
= Make good a loss
= Remove excess cash

These buttons will be available for any clerk to record the “making good” events.
Such “make good” events will be recorded in the audit trail and can be viewed using
the normal event reporting mechanisms and will also be passed through to MIS. They
are also shown on the Stock Unit Balance Report (section 2.5.1.4.1), the Variance
Report (section 2.5.1.2.2) and the Branch Trading Report (section 2.5.1.4.2).

Invoking either button will result in a screen being presented to the user inviting them
to enter the amount to be made good (or removed). No attempt is made to calculate
or verify this amount is-to-be-made, since it is assumed that trading has taken place
since the last Declaration.

The Variance report may help the User in working out how much (s)he needs to Make Good.

Note that if there is no current Cash Declaration for the Stock Unit (ie no Cash
Declaration has been made since the Stock Unit was last balanced or created), then the
Make Good or Remove Excess Cash processing will be rejected (see [DIAGDEC]).

Two separate events will be defined:
= Make good a loss (Event Id 59)
= Remove excess cash (Event Id 58)

These events will be classified as Balancing Events and SU Balancing Events and will
contain a Parameter <P1:> containing the amount of cash Made Good / Removed.
This amount will always be held as a positive amount — the different events will allow
the effect to be deduced when reporting on the amounts.

The relevant event is written to record the fact that the Stock Unit’s cash position has
been corrected.

In addition, the last cash declaration for the Stock Unit will be updated (for an
unshared Stock Unit the user will be asked to chose which Declaration Id should be
updated). [BT032]

Any subsequent attempt to update the declaration will make it clear that there is an
amount “made good” (or removed) from the Declaration. However if a subsequent
Declaration is made, it is assumed that the cash declared at that time is correct and the
record of the amount made good (or removed) will not be carried forward in the
Declaration.
2.5.1.2.4 Stock Declarations and Variances
This supports the Business Process Local Stock Check Stock Held for Stock Unit.
There are currently two mechanisms supported for managing Stock levels and
adjusting them:
= Stock Adjustments
This mechanism presents the clerk with a list of all Stock items (apart from cash
and “other stamps”), together with the system derived stock levels.
The user can then page through the list of products and amend the volume of any
products to match those actually held. When the Finish button is pressed a “Stock
Adjustment” transaction is created for each stock item whose level has been
changed based on the Sale Price and a balancing transaction of cash in each case.
= Stock Declarations
This mechanism is only available in a Shared Stock Unit. The clerk is presented
with a list of all previous Stock Declarations made, together with their Declaration
Ids and timestamps in this current Balance Period. They can then select one of
these declarations to update or alternatively decide to make a new declaration from
scratch.
They are then presented with a list of all Stock items (apart from cash and “other
stamps”) and are invited to make a “blind declaration2. This declaration may be an
update to any previous declaration made since the Stock Unit was last rolled over
(see section 2.5.1.2.1). If it is a new declaration, then they are required to enter a
Declaration Id.
Subsequent use of the Discrepancies function or running a Trial Balance will then
compare the total Declarations for the Stock Unit with the System Derived figures
and highlight any discrepancies that are identified. If this check is done as part of
the Trial Balance process, then the discrepancies must be accepted, which will
result in a Discrepancy transaction being created for each stock item whose level is
identified as being in error based on the Sale Price and a balancing transaction of
the Discrepancy product in each case.
Both of these mechanisms need to be retained, however rather than using the Sale
Price when recording the Adjustment or Discrepancy transaction, a separate “loss
price” should be used. This “loss price” will optionally be supplied as part of the
Product Reference Data. Should no “loss price” be defined in Reference Data, then
the Sale Price should be used. [BT036]
This has a number of implications:

= Changes are required to Product Reference data to include an optional “loss price”
for those products where it is different from the sale price. This is discussed
further in section 3.5.
= The Pick lists displayed by the Stock Adjustment and Stock Declaration functions,
include the Sale Price in brackets after the Product Name. This should be replaced
by the “loss price” (if specified).
= When the Adjustment or Discrepancy is recorded as a Transaction, then the price
used should be the “loss price”.

account that the loss price may well differ from the Sale Price.
Currently Methods of Payments such as Cheques and Vouchers are also presented in

The move from a weekly Cash Account to a monthly Branch Trading cycle means that
there will up to be 5 times as much data to scan when preparing a report, and some
reports will be much bigger. However there are no requirements to improve the
reporting mechanisms, and so increased report production times are acceptable.
[BT001]
Dev have some ideas in terms of “caching” Data Server data to improve the performance, but I
want to avoid this if at all possible so as to keep things simple.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

Currently all reports have references to CAP within their headers. Changes will be
required to change this to a Trading Period identifier.

2.5.1.3.1 Remuneration Reporting

This supports the Business Process Produce Sales Report to Assist Remuneration
Check. The business requirement is that a postmaster can look at the data that will be
used by HR SAP to calculate his remuneration. It should be noted that this will only
provide a guide, since it will not take into account issues such as the fact that lottery
transactions are paid for early and that the report doesn’t necessarily include non-
accounting data for which the Postmaster is remunerated. However it is up to the
Postmaster to select the appropriate dates that align with those used for delineating
“pay months”. Another aspect of this alignment is that the dates specified need to
align to EOD markers rather than to calendar dates so that again the data aligns with
that which is passed to HR SAP.

The requirements are to be met by making a change to the way in which the current
Sales Report is produced.

Currently, the Sales Report reports on all relevant transactions since the start of the
current Cash Account period.

The requirement is to include an additional dialogue at the start of the process asking
the clerk to input a Start Date and an End Date.

The dialogue will be formally defined in [DIAGREP], however it will have the
following characteristics: [BT016]

1) A new button is added to the “Produce Report” screen called “Define Date
range”

2) The Report tablet will include “Trading Period” rather than “Office CAP”

3) If no Date range is selected then the current behaviour will continue (ie from
the start of the current Trading Period up until the present time)

4) If “Define Date range” is selected, then the clerk is invited to select firstly a
Start Date and then an End Date. These are both to be specified as normal
calendar dates (dd/mm/yy). The following validation is required:

a) End Date is no later than “yesterday” and EOD has been run for that
day.

b) Start Date is less than or equal to End Date
c) Start Date is not less than xx days before “today”

Where xx is defined in Reference Data and defines the Transaction
Retention time.

5) The scan for the Transactions to build the report should be modified so that if a
Date Range is specified, then the start point for the transactions is defined as
the EOD marker for the Trading day before Start Date, and the end point for
the transactions is defined as the EOD marker for the Trading day of End Date.
These EOD markers can be found by following the chain of EOD Markers
from the Current EOD Object.

2.5.1.3.2 Office Snapshot Report
This supports the Business Process Review Stock Held Across Branch.

This report is similar in layout to the Stock Unit Balance report, however covers all
transactions for all Stock Units, rather than being restricted to a single Stock Unit.

It is proposed that its scope is unchanged, however the actual report layout will be
changed in line with the changes being made to the Stock Unit Balance report as
defined in section 2.5.1.4.1.3. [BT037]

2.5.1.3.3 Suspense Account Report

This report needs to take into account the changes to the Suspense Products
(described in section 2.5.1.1.4) and also the introduction of the “Local Suspense
Account”. [BT039]

It has been agreed that this report will continue to be available to all users (ie no
additional security needs to be added).

However to avoid the report growing too much and to enable old Suspense Products
to be “retired”, some additional flexibility is required in the way the report is produced.
Currently all possible Suspense Products are reported on in the Suspense Account
Report. In future only those Suspense Products which have either a Balance or a
movement during the Trading Period should be included. All Suspense Products with
zero balance and no movements in the period should be suppresses when the report is
printed.

There is an added complexity. With the introduction of Cash in Pouches at S60, there
will be a potentially large number of Cash in Pouches transactions, particularly in large
branches (maybe hundreds in a 5 week period). Therefore CP3787 has been raised to
address this issue. The solution has two aspects:

= The “Cash in Pouches” section of the Suspense Report will be handled differently
from all other Suspense product, in that only the summary line will be included.
This summary line will just give the total Volume and Value of Cash in Pouches
Transactions together with the B/Fwd and C/Fwd figures. The detailed
transactions will be suppressed.

= A new report will be introduced which will provide the details of all the Cash in
Pouches Transactions. This report will be optional.

2.5.1.3.4 Counter Weekly Redeemed Savings Stamps Report
This is a new report. [BT107]

It should become a mandatory report with a cut-off and must be produced if any
savings stamps have been redeemed. It should include a total of all transactions which
involve redeemed trading stamps since the last cut-off. These can be identified by
having a Level 2 accounting node of 535.

2.5.1.3.5 APS Transactions Report
This report is currently produced based on all Transactions that are found under the
APS Node in the accounting hierarchy. Given the need to introduce Stock Products
for AP Transactions, then the report should be changed to report on all Transactions
which have been written with <Application:APS>.
2.5.1.3.6 Event Log
No changes are required to the reports as such, however there will be additional events
introduced which will need to be categorised appropriately to appear on the various
subsets of events.
This should be purely a Reference Data change to the Events Collection.
2.5.1.3.7 Other reports affected by changes to Stock Processing
The changes to Stock Processing, particularly those requiring stock to be held by
Volume rather than by Value (see section 2.5.1.1.2) require a number of reports to be
changed so that stock values are no longer reported. [BT056]
I've also seen some example reports where a stock item only has a value and no volume
clearly we will need to ensure that this doesn’t cause any problems. Hopefully it is just bad
examples in [REPREC]. However there are some products listed in Table 21 (section 2.5.1.2.4)
which need special consideration.
This is expected to be primarily a change to the report definitions in GlobalObjects.dat rather
than actual code changes.

are specified:

2.5.1.3.7.1_ I Remittance and Transfer Reports
The general rule regarding Remittance and Transfer reports is that reports that indicate
specific transactions should show volumes and suppress values (for volume stock).
Reports that summarise remittances / transfers should suppress volumes and
summarise values (usually to zero for volume stock remittances / transfers). The
exception to this is the Office Weekly Remittances In / Out reports which summarise
by product rather than by remittance and so, on these, volume products should be
summarised by volume, and value products by value.

2.5.1.3.7.2 Remittance and Transfer Summaries
The report layouts should remain unchanged, however any stock remittances will be at
zero value, thus resulting in the value column usually being zero in such cases.
2.5.1.3.7.3. Other Reports
These need to be considered individually:
= Declaration: Stock on Hand
The value column should be remain in the report layout to support stock that is still
handled by Value, however the value should be suppressed for those products
handled by Volume (rather than included as zero). The total at the bottom should
be removed.
= Counter Weekly Stock on Hand
This report needs to be restructured in a similar way to the Stock Unit Balance
report (see section 2.5.1.4.1.3).
It will contain two main sections:
o Value Stock and MOP
o Volume Stock
corresponding to the sections in the Stock Unit Balance report.

The Value column should be removed in the Volume Stock section and no Total is
required in that section.

This restructuring can be achieved by using the Tertiary mappings described in
section 2.5.1.4.1.3.

2.5.1.3.8 Reprints of Reports

Currently a number of reports are defined as being capable of being reprinted.

Reprint.

Track-and Trace Manifest Reprint

Table 23 - Reports that can be reprinted

It is also required that the new Variances report will need to be reprinted. Since the
requirements for this are somewhat different to other reports this is considered as part
of the Variance report in section 2.5.1.2.2. [BT060a]

The current mechanism for this is that each time one of these re-printable reports is
produced, then the start and end markers used for producing the report are stored and
the reprint is achieved by rescanning the transactions using those markers. This means
that reprints can be done for those CAPs that are still “in scope”.

The move to 4 / 5 week Trading Periods makes the Reprint function more complex.
Different reports are affected in different ways:
= Office Weekly Counters Revenue Schedule: Reprint

Since the original report is to be removed, then there is no need for a reprint.

= Frack-andFrace Manifest-Reprint

The current functionality is purely to reprint the last report produced. so no change

is required.

= Office Weekly Inland Revenue Tax Credits P5589: Reprint

= Office Weekly P&A P2311MA: Reprint

= Office Weekly Redeemed Savings Stamps Summary: Reprint

= Variance Report Reprint (new)
All of these will continue to be weekly reports, however they will be identified by
the Date Range for which they were produced rather than by the CAP of the week
for which they apply.
The requirement is to be able to reprint all those reports for which the data is still
available, ie the last 5 reports. Therefore, no changes are required to the way in

which the reprints are produced other than by identifying past reports by a date
range rather than a CAP.

Note that when the branch has just migrated from CAP operation into Branch
Trading operation, it should still be possible to Reprint the reports from the “CAP
period”, however such reports will be identified to the user by the dates when they
were produced rather than by the CAP they were produced for and they will be
printed in the new format.

= Stock Unit Balance: Reprint
= Branch Trading Report: Reprint

Here, the requirement is to be able to reprint the last report that has been produced
for each Stock Unit /Office (excluding any interim Stock Unit Balance Period
reports). This will be achieved by ensuring that all data required to reprint the
report is stored as a BLOB within the messagestore at the time that the report is
originally run. New reprint functionality is then required to take the data from this
BLOB and regenerate the report based on that data. Since only the last report
requires to be reprinted, it is sufficient to maintain the last report data as a
Persistent Object which is overwritten each time a new report is produced.

However it will also be possible to reprint all Balance Period reports for the
current and previous Trading Period.

Note that during the first Branch Trading Period it should still be possible to
reprint the last CAP based Stock Unit Balance Report or Cash Account Report,
provided that all the data for such a report is still available in the message store (ie
by invoking the old code to regenerate the report from the raw data). Once a
Stock Unit or Branch has rolled over into the second Branch Trading Period, then
there is no need to be able to reprint CAP based data.

2.5.1.3.9 Reports proposed to be removed

The following reports are considered no longer necessary as a result of the changes
introduced by Impact (or other changes) and so will to be removed. [BT057]

2.5.1.3.10 Weekly Reports
There are currently a number of Weekly Reports within Horizon. The move to a
monthly Trading Period means that all these reports need to be reviewed as to what
affect this might have on them. The underlying principle is that current weekly reports
will remain weekly and will be driven by a normal calendar (typically start of business
on Thursday to close of business the following Wednesday). Reports will either be
mandatory or non-mandatory in terms of business processes. Mandatory reports will
be produced weekly by reference to the calendar by the Branch staff. Non-mandatory
reports will be produced by the same means but if not printed will accumulate data
during the trading period until they are printed. Some reports are defined as
Mandatory within Horizon and what this means is that Horizon will ensure that they
are printed before allowing the Stock Unit to rollover at trading period end.
No support is required from Horizon to manage conformance to any of the above
other than the following:
= Existing mechanisms for forcing reports to be produced prior to Stock Unit /
Office rollover will be maintained
m Any necessary changes to ensure that reports can be cut-off other than at period
end (for example on a weekly basis where required) such that subsequent weekly
reports only report from the last cut-off rather than for the full Trading Period to
date are needed.
Many reports have the concept of a cut-off. What this means is that once a report has
been successfully produced, the clerk can request a cut-off, such that any subsequent
attempts to produce this report will only look at Transactions that have taken place
since the cut-off was invoked.
Table 25 lists all the current weekly report and highlights those that need to be
considered further.

2.5.1.4 Balancing and Rollover

There are a number of aspects to this:
= Changes to Rollover processing

= Branch Trading Reports

= Remove Extended CAPs

a Selecting the next Trading Period

These are discussed further below.

2.5.1.4.1 Changes to Rollover processing

The March 2003 costings assumed no change to this process and so no costs were defined in
this area.

This supports the Business Processes Produce Trial Balance and Produce Final
Balance.

In general, the Stock Unit Balancing process will be very similar to that which is
currently in place. The following highlights the changes: [BT038]

The following are the main areas for change:

= Checking that a Stock Unit is balanced before allowing a Trial Balance to be
produced

= Handling Discrepancies prior to Rolling over

= Producing the Trial Balance / Final Balance report

= Rolling over the data into the next Trading Period
The migration implications are covered separately in section 2.6.3.2.2.

These are discussed below.

2.5.1.4.1.1_ I Checking that a Stock Unit is balanced
Some additional checks are required at this point:
= On the Final Stock Unit to be rolled over within the Branch
a Check that there are no Outstanding Transaction Corrections within the Branch

This check is similar to the one carried out at logon (see section 2.5.1.6).

2.5.1.4.1.2 Handling Discrepancies prior to Rolling over

At the point where the user decides whether the rollover is to a new Trading Period or
to a new Balance Period within the current Trading Period, additional checks are
required.

If the rollover is to a new Trading Period (as opposed to a Balance period):

= any Nett Discrepancy needs to be transferred from the Stock Unit to the Branch’s
Local Suspense Account. This is done by generating a pair of transactions such
that the first transaction causes the cumulative value of the Discrepancy products
for that SU becomes zero and the other transaction is generated to balance this
transaction against the Local Suspense Account product. These transactions
should be carried out in Mode Housekeeping (HK).

= If this is the last Stock Unit to rollover, also need to ensure that the Local
Suspense account has been cleared. If it has not yet been cleared a dialogue is
introduced to allow it to be cleared at the time.

There is a requirement (that emerged in the UI workshops) that different
“products” are available for settlement depending upon the type of branch. The
rules for which products should be available are as follows:

a If Local Suspense has an overall gain (ie cash needs to be removed from the till
to balance it), then one list of products needs to be presented

a If Local Suspense has an overall loss (ie cash needs to be put in the till to
balance it), then a separate list of products needs to be presented

It is proposed that each of these lists is presented as a Product Group which
identifies the relevant products. Some products may be non-core and they should
only be included in the pick list if they are available to be transacted in the branch
(as is the normal case for pick lists). Similarly some products may have minimum
or maximum values defined for them (in the normal way) and again they should
only be included in the list if the amount required to clear local suspense (ie the
negative of the amount in local suspense) is valid.

Should the selected product fail to be transacted then a suitable message should be
displayed to the user and they then have the opportunity to select a different
product or to abandon the rollover (using the Prev or Home buttons as normal).

A consequence of this is that the Final Balance Report may differ from the Trial
Balance report.
2.5.1.4.1.3. Producing the Trial Balance / Final Balance report

The actual Stock Unit Balance report that is produced (both for Trial and Final
Balances) will be amended as follows: [BT007]

The following are the areas in which changes are required:
= Header

Standard report header changes to remove CAP from the Header are required
here.

= Discrepancies Section

After the existing Discrepancy details, there is a need to add in the new lines for
the “Cash Made Good” and “Excess Cash removed” events. This information
should be obtained from the events recorded at the time (see section 2.5.1.2.3). A
total is also required. [BT032]

Note that on a Final Balance following a Trading Period Rollover, the Nett
discrepancy line will be zero.

= Balance Section

Since Stock is to be held by volume rather than value, then Volume Stock holdings
should be removed from this section.

This is to be achieved by including a new set of mappings on all stock product
Reference Data and included in all Stock Transactions known as Tertiary
Mappings. These Tertiary Mappings will be in addition to the existing mappings
included on the Transactions.

Ifa Transaction has a Tertiary Mapping, then it is ignored when constructing this
section of the table. This will result in only those Inventory products with no
Tertiary Mappings (eg cash, cheques, other stamps or Foreign Exchange) being
included in this section of the Balance Report.

= Receipts Section
All Volume stock movements will need to be included in the receipts section.

If an Item has a Tertiary mapping then this should be used instead of its Primary
mapping when building up this part of the report.

In addition further lines will be required for Local Suspense Transfers.

Revaluation Up transactions will no longer occur, so the “Reval Up” line should be
suppressed if it is zero.

It should be noted that since Volume Stock Remittances will have zero value, then
their value will be excluded from the Remittance part of this section. The same
also applies to Volume Stock Transfers.

If an Item has a Tertiary mapping then this should be used instead of its Primary
mapping when building up this part of the report.

I wouldn't expect any Stock Products to be mapped to the Payments section, however the
implementation should allow for it rather than exclude it.

New lines will be required for Local Suspense Transfers.

Revaluation Down transactions will no longer occur, so the “Reval Down” line
should be suppressed if it is zero.

It should be noted that since Volume Stock Remittances will have zero value, then
their value will be excluded from the Remittance part of this section. The same
also applies to Volume Stock Transfers.

= Stock Section

This is a new section. Its purpose is to provide the current balance (by volume) of
all stock items that are held by volume. This can be done by selecting all stock
items (including the opening balance for the period) that have tertiary mappings,
but building the report based on the primary mappings. Such a figure will take into
account all Remittances and Transfers.

In order to support the revised reprinting functionality, the data used to build up the
report needs to be stored as a BLOB so that the report can be re-printed without the
original transactions being present.

2.5.1.4.1.4 Rolling over the data into the next Trading Period

The current rollover process generates a large amount of data from the Stock Unit
Balance report for use as an opening position for the new trading period. In the future,
less data needs to be generated. The following defines what data needs to be
generated following the Stock Unit Rollover:

= Opening Balances of all Inventory Products. This includes

o Stock (this should just be a volume with a zero value other than those
exceptional products covered in section 2.5.1.1.2.4)

Any such item that has a Tertiary mapping should include a “dummy” Tertiary
mapping to ensure that it is handled correctly on the Balance Reports.

a Cash and near cash (eg cheques and ForEx)
a Suspense products

This data is currently written to the messagestore as part of the SU Rollover
process and, other than holding the carried forward stock with zero value (if there
are Tertiary Mappings present), no further changes are required.

= Summary Information from the Balance Report to support the Branch Trading

2.5.1.4.2 Branch Trading Reports

This is the replacement for the Cash Account report.

This supports the Business Process Produce and Confirm Trading Statement.
[BT008, BT032, BT041, BT043]

Tt is assumed that the existing Office Rollover button will trigger this report instead of
the current Cash Account Report.

The processing when the button is touched is as follows:
1) The normal “Produce Report” screen is displayed
2) The Report tablet will include “Trading Period” and the current week

3) All the current checks made prior to allowing a Trial Cash Account to be
produced are made except that the check for non-value stock can be removed.
[BT063]

4) The report can then be built up as follows:

I The following is a high level outline. The detailed report is defined in [DIAGBAL]

a) Standard Heading

b) The first column provides an Office Total and is obtained by summing
the values in the row. The second column provides details of what is
currently held in the Suspense Account. The remaining columns
provide details recorded when each Stock Unit rolled over into the next
trading period. If there are too many Stock Units to fit on a single
page, then additional pages are required. Each page will repeat the
Row headings, however there is no need for subtotals to be carried
forward from one page to the next.

c) The data in each row can be obtained from the data stored as part of
each Stock Unit’s rollover process (see-section 3-41)

In order to support the revised reprinting functionality, the data used to build up the
report needs to be stored as-a-BLOB so that the report can be re-printed without the
original transactions being present.

2.5.1.4.3 Remove Extended CAPs

The Office Balancing Menu currently has a button to allow Cash Accounts to be
extended to 2 or 3 weeks.

This button should be removed, thus removing this functionality since it no longer
makes sense with Branch Trading Statements. [BT045]

2.5.1.4.4 Selecting the next Trading Period

When a Branch is rolling forward into the next Trading Period, it is necessary to
decide what the following period will be.

The current mechanism is fairly simple (ignoring extended CAPs which are no longer
supported at S80), namely that it will add 1 to the current “next CAP” number and if

the resulting CAP number exists in Reference Data, then it will set that as the new
“next CAP”. If that CAP number doesn’t exist, then it is assumed to be the end of the
year and so the Reference Data for CAP I of the next year is checked and if that exists
then “next CAP” will be set to this. Should this not exist either, then the rollover will
be prevented and an error displayed to the user.

With Trading Periods, the same approach will be followed. However given the
increased likelihood of running out of Trading Periods before the end of the year the
algorithm for setting “next TP” will be as follows:

= Add 1 to current “Next TP”
= Ifthe resulting TP number exists in the Reference Data calendar, all is well so exit

= Ifthe resulting TP number doesn’t exist in the Reference Data calendar, check for
TP 1 of “next year”. If that is found in the Reference Data calendar, use it

= If“next year” doesn’t exist yet, use the resulting TP (ie “next TP”+1). Note that in
this case the TP will not exist in the calendar so the normal prompts to the user
warning them that the TP is incorrect and on subsequent logons that the TP
doesn’t match the calendar will be output. However this is seen to be a better
option than forcing the branch to stay in the current TP until the end of the year.

2.5.1.5 EOD

There are a number of aspects to this:
= Removal of LFS Weekly Stock Reporting functions
= POL FS Summarisation at counter
= Maintenance of Office Variances Persistent Object
= LFS EOD functionality changes to handle changes in Cash Declarations
= Simplification of EPOSS Reconciliation
= Protection against lost data
The current APS EOD Reconciliation function will remain unchanged. [BT059]
These are discussed in the following sub-sections.
2.5.1.5.1 Removal of LFS Weekly Stock Reporting functions

The current LFS Weekly Stock Reporting functions which are run early on Thursday
and Friday mornings and again on Friday evening, should be removed from the
Counter Applications Schedule since they are no longer required. [BT058]

It is proposed that the code is left in the counter rather than actually being removed.

Strictly not part of EOD, but that’s as good a place to mention it as any other.

In theory it could be done tomorrow, but we need to understand what constraints there might be
from testing as to when it is removed. The actual removal is a change to the Reference Data
that controls the CAS.

2.5.1.5.2 POL FS Summarisation at counter

This functionality was introduced as part of Impact Release I at S60. With the move
to Transaction Summarisation at the Data Centre (see section 2.5.2.8), this
functionality will no longer be required other than to calculate the Carried Forward
cash position for the SAP ADS ONCH data flow. Because of this dependency, it is
simplest to leave the functionality unchanged.

2.5.1.5.3 Maintenance of Office Variances Persistent Object

In order to support the Variance Report (described in section 2.5.1.2.2) a new function
is required as part of EOD processing to calculate information for the report.

This function will assemble the data needed for that day’s portion of the Office
Variance Persistent Object.

It will also handle the bringing forward of data from previous days’ Variance Persistent
Objects in the case where no cash declaration is done (either where it is “forgotten” or
the Drawer / Stock Unit is unused for a day).

2.5.1.5.4 LFS EOD functionality changes to handle changes in Cash Declarations

It has now been decided that it is simplest to leave this functionality unchanged.
[BT029]

2.5.1.5.5 Simplification of EPOSS Reconciliation

The current EPOSS Reconciliation function runs each day as part of the EOD set of
tasks. At present this is a fairly complex set of tasks, however once the cash account
has been removed, then it should be possible to simplify it significantly to a simple
check that all Transactions have been successfully harvested.

It is proposed that this is achieved by providing a new function that merely calculates
the Daily Transaction Totals.

Therefore no changes will be made to the current function and the Reference Data that
invokes this function will be removed and replaced by Reference Data to invoke the
new function at the appropriate migration stage (see section 2.6.2). [BT059]

2.5.1.5.6 Protection against lost data

This is a new EOD Check that is required to protect against the potential loss of data
as discussed earlier in section 2.5.1.1.1.4. [BT115]

This check needs to be run on all counters every night as part of the EOD process.
However it is not important when in the EOD sequence it is actually run.

A check is required on the following:
= How many days ago was the Branch rolled over into the current Trading Period?

= For each stock Unit in the Branch that is still current (ie not Deleted), how many
days ago was it last rolled over into a new Trading Period?

In order to support this, the StockUnit Persistent Object and the EPOSSOffice CAP
Persistent Object will both need to include a new field “Date of last Trading Period
Rollover”, so that this check can easily be made without trawling through the
messagestore.

The Largest number of days detected from these checks needs to be calculated and this
number needs to be compared against a configurable parameter (configurable via Type
C Reference data to allow tuning — the proposed value is 38 days).

If the number of days exceeds the threshold, then the Riposte configuration parameter
DisableArchiving needs to be checked and if it is currently set to 0 it should be set to
1. Regardless of whether the parameter is changed an Error Event should be raised to
alert SMC.

If the number of days does not exceed the threshold, then the Riposte configuration
parameter DisableArchiving needs to be checked and if it is currently set to 1 it should
be reset to 0. There is no need to record an error event in this case.

Simon has suggested that we may need to do some work to produce a report on these events to
pass to POL. This is excluded from the current costs. [BT0S1]

NB: Any such reporting would be a Data Centre function and have no impact on the counter.

2.5.1.6 Logon Checks

This is a new requirement and wasn’t included in the March 2003 costings.

There are a number of aspects to this:

2.5.1.6.1 ONCH run for “yesterday”

The checks currently carried out as part of the logon process that an ONCH
declaration was made the previous day, should be amended to check that a Cash
Declaration was made the previous day. If no cash declaration was made the previous
day, the user will be forced to make a declaration at that time. [BT028]

2.5.1.6.2 Stock Unit in correct Trading Period

The existing check that a Stock Unit is running in the correct Cash Account Period
(based on the Cash Account Weeks Reference Data), needs to be modified such that
the check is based on the Trading Period (based on the Trading Period Calendar).

In order to spread the workload at the centre, different branches will be configured (in
the Branch’s “Outlet Reference Data”) with an “Offset” (in days) from the Trading
Period Calendars. [BT044] See also section 3.5.

2.5.1.6.3 Outstanding Transaction Corrections
This supports the Business Process Receive Automated Message.

In order to inform the Postmaster that a Transaction Correction has arrived in the
branch for processing, an additional check is required on logon for any user with a
Role of Manager or Supervisor (actual list of Roles to be defined in Reference Data
see section 3.5), to see if there are any unprocessed Transaction Corrections.
[BT024a] How this is done is described in Section 2.5.1.7.2. If there are any, the user
should be prompted about their existence and given the option to invoke the Process
Transaction Correction function immediately, provided that this is not an isolated
node. Such a check should take place after all other existing checks.

An event needs to be recorded when a user is prompted. Section 20.15 of [CDBT]
defines how the event should be categorised. This is a new event with Identifier 62
and needs to include a parameter indicating the number of Outstanding Transaction
Corrections.

2.5.1.6.4 Protection against Data Loss

This is a new logon check. The logic is similar to that done at End of Day described in
section 2.5.1.5.6.

A check is required on the following:
= How many days ago was the Branch rolled over into the current Trading Period?

= How many days ago was the current Stock Unit rolled over into the current
Trading Period?

If either of these periods is greater than a configurable parameter (configurable via
Type C Reference data to allow tuning — the proposed value is 38 days), then a
warning is displayed to the user indicating this fact

2.5.1.7 Process Transaction Correction

The March 2003 costings for this assumed that a centrally generated memo view was s
and so no counter functionality was required. Any counter work is therefore in addition to the
March 2003 costings.

This supports the Business Process Handle Transaction Corrections.
There are a number of aspects to this:

= Actual Processing of the Transaction Corrections

= Selecting Transaction Corrections

= Reporting on Transaction Corrections

These are discussed in the following sub-sections.

2.5.1.7.1 Actual Processing of the Transaction Corrections

This is new functionality to automate the processing of Transaction Corrections (a
replacement for Error Notices). It is only available to those Roles who can do an
Office Balance (ie Manager, Supervisor, Migrate, Auditor and Auditor - Emergency
Manager). This will be controlled using normal Menu Sccurity functionality.

This function will be activated by a new button on Horizon or as part of the logon
process (see section 2.5.1.6). [BT025]

Given the security requirements, it is simplest to add the button to the Housekeeping
menu.

When the function is invoked, the user will be presented with a list of outstanding
Transaction Corrections. Section 2.5.1.7.2 describes how Outstanding Transaction
corrections are found.

The list should be a picklist with the Transaction Corrections ordered based on Date
and Time generated. If multiple Transaction Corrections have the same Date and Time
generated, then they are further ordered based on the TC Reference field which is a
concatenation of Iteration flag and Reference Id.

The user can then select a Transaction Correction from the list and process it.

Once a Transaction Correction has been selected for processing the system needs to
ensure that no other user is able to select that Transaction Correction for processing.

NB if it is simpler to lock out users from all TC processing rather than just locking out an
individual TC, then this is acceptable.

EPOSS Watchdog needs to ensure that Transaction Corrections are prevented on
isolated nodes. This is a Reference Data Change.

The user will be shown what effect the Transaction Correction will have on their
branch position by displaying the Text field associated with the Transaction Correction
and will be invited to select one of up to 3 options associated with the Transaction
Correction (as specified in the Allowed Modes field).

[TCAIS] defines the interface in detail and in particular defines the 6 options that can
be presented to the user (though for any one Transaction Correction a maximum of 3
are available). Each of these Options is required to correspond to a new Settlement
Mode to simplify the passing of the data back to POL FS through the normal
Summarisation interface.

[CTRDEC] defines how the Transaction Correction is to be held as Attribute
Grammar.

Depending on the mode selected the Transaction Correction will be processed as
follows:

= Mode MG (Make Good)

The Transaction Correction will define the Product to be transacted
(<Data.Article:>) and the accounting sense (<Data.AccountingSense:>), and also
the Product against which the Transaction Correction should be settled
(<Data.Instruction:>).

Following the UIDP discussions, it has now been agreed that in the following
circumstances the “Instruction” product may be substituted. These circumstances
are:

a If “Instruction” is “cash” (ie Product 1) and the accounting sense is such that
cash must be put in the till (ie TCINV—or-do+meanFCCRM?)

a Then, Cheque can be used instead.

[And so could Debit Card when CP 3785 is implemented. I

= Modes HD (Plead Hardship), WO (Wrote Off) or AN (Assign to Nominee)

The Transaction Correction will define the Product to be transacted
(<Data.Article>) and the accounting sense (<Data.AccountingSense:>).
Settlement will be against a fixed Settlement Product for the selected mode.

This fixed product would be defined in the normal ModeParameters Type C
Reference Data.

= Mode EV (Request Evidence)

In the case of Mode EV two transactions are written against the article Product,
one positive and one negative, thus having a null effect on the Branch accounts.
However both transactions will be passed to POL FS so that they can tell that this
has happened.

= Mode SW (Stock Write On / Off)

In this case there will just be a single transaction (with Quantity and no value)
against the Article product (<Data.Article:>). Since it has no value, then there is
nothing to settle.

To protect against the product having a fixed price, thus resulting in a Value being
generated, the SW Mode will be defined as using a zero price for Stock by Volume
products.

Note that this will not solve the problem for a Stock by Value product. Should this
occur, then the Instruction Product will be used to settle any Value included on the
stack.
In all cases the transactions that are generated by this process (including any settlement
transactions) need to include the TC Reference (<Data.Ref:>) and the additienal-data-
client reference field (<Data:AddRef:>) so that it can be passed to POL FS.

These should be put into two new attributes under
<EPOSSTransaction.BlackBoxData:> called Ref and AddRef.

Version 2.0

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

When the Transaction Correction is processed a Transaction Correction Processed
message should be written as part of the same Riposte Transaction, thus enabling
reports to understand the outcome of the Transaction Correction and to ensure that it
is not reprocessed.

It will also be possible to abandon the Transaction Correction. Should the Transaction
Correction be abandoned, then there will be no impact on the system and the
Transaction Correction will still appear in the list of outstanding Transaction
Corrections and may be processed by a suitably empowered user at a later time.
However any locks applied to prevent other users processing the Transaction
Correction will need to be removed.

Should the user select one of the options associated with the Transaction Correction,
then the underlying Transactions defined in the Transaction Correction will be applied
in the Stock Unit in which the user is currently assigned.

Should any of the associated Transactions fail validation for whatever reason, a
suitable message will be displayed to the user providing them with information to raise
a Help Desk call. The Transaction Correction will then be marked as having been
processed, though no underlying transactions will actually be performed.

A consequence of this is that a new method needs to be made available by EPOSS
Core, such that it is possible to pass it a Transaction and to decide whether or not it is
valid. If it is decided it is valid, then any subsequent request to write that Transaction
would always succeed.

This is necessary since at present any problems with the parameters would result in
prompts to the user about “miss-typed transactions”.

2.5.1.7.2 Selecting Transaction Corrections

[CTRDEC] describes how a Transaction Correction is stored within the messagestore.
Transaction Corrections can be easily identified by having a <WAIndex.LFSFlag:TC>
attribute and <Data.Ref:> and <Data.Iter:> attributes containing the unique
Transaction Correction Reference defined by POL FS.

A simple scan of the messagestore looking for all such messages will identify all
Transaction Corrections that have been received in the branch.

Once a Transaction Correction has been processed (as described in section 2.5.1.7.1),
then a Transaction Correction Processed message is written containing the
<WAIndex.LFSFlag:TP> attribute.

This mechanism then enables all Outstanding Transaction Corrections to be easily
identified as being those with a <WAIndex.LFSFlag:TC> message and no
corresponding <WAIndex.LFSFlag:TP> message for any given Transaction Correction
Reference.

Similarly all those Transaction Correction References with both a
<WAIndex.LFSFlag:TC> message and a corresponding <WAIndex.LFSFlag:TP>
message identify those Transaction Corrections that have been processed.

2.5.1.7.3 Reporting on Transaction Corrections
Two new reports are required to provide information about Transaction Corrections.
These are: [BT065]
= Outstanding Transaction Corrections Report
= Processed Transaction Corrections Report
Section 20.3 in Appendix B of [CDBT] defines the structure of these reports which are
both similar. Detailed definition of the report layouts will be defined as part of the
High Level Design phase in [DIAGDEC].
The principle difference between the two reports is in selecting which Transaction
Corrections are to be reported on. This is described in section 2.5.1.7.2.
2.5.1.8 MiMAN
This is an aspect that was forgotten in the original design.
MiMAN is a desktop component that handles the initial startup of a new Branch in
Horizon.
It was designed to support the initial rollout of Horizon and enables opening values to
be input to Horizon to represent the state of each Stock Unit at the time that the Stock
Unit switches from manual processing to Horizon.
It is now primarily used when a new Branch opens or reopens after a long term
temporary closure.
MiMAN is driven by the Cash Account Reference Data and provides a fast mechanism
for taking on the opening position.
It is proposed that MiMAN is replaced by a simple function that identifies whether or
not the Branch should be opening in CAP of TP mode and sets up an initial opening
balance of zero and initialises the current CAP / TP as appropriate. This is discussed
further in section 2.6.3.2.6.
2.5.1.9 Removal of Training Mode
Training Mode is currently invoked through a button on the main menu.
This button is set up as part of the <Collection:DesktopApps><ObjectName:Training>
Type D Reference Data.
Training Mode will be disabled by removing this via a Reference Data change just
before Point 20. No attempt will be made to tidy up any Training Mode code or
remove any other Training Mode support.
This is in response to removed PSO_CR00280 (CP 3842).

2.5.2.4

The main changes here are to support the new Reference Data that will be received
from POL as Type A Reference Data. This will be defined in [RDSAIS].

In addition there will be a Check function provided which will ensure the integrity of
the summarisation Reference Data. In particular it will need to ensure that all Product
/ Mode combinations have a defined mapping onto an Article. If this isn’t the case,
then there is a risk that when the transactions from a branch are summarised that they
will not balance to zero.

LFS

Nothing was included in the March 2003 costings in this area.

The weekly Stock Reporting functionality can be removed. This affects both the LFS
Agent and the LFS Host. Since the information is currently unused, it might as well be
removed as soon as LFS is upgraded at the Data Centre. [BT058]

It has now been decided that the simplest way to do this is to change the LFS
Harvester such that it no longer attempts to Harvest the Stock Statements. At the
simplest level this is purely a case of removing the filter from the LFS Harvester, but
the opportunity should also be taken to remove the associated code modules that
process the Stock statements and in particular the modules that access the Stock tables
in the LFS Host.

The LFS Host (and Maestro schedules) can then be enhanced to remove these tables
and the associated modules that process Stock Statements.

Process SAP ADS Transactions

The requirement for this has been removed and so the rest of this section has been deleted.

TPS Harvesting

This supports the Business Processes Scan Transaction for Day.
A few changes have been identified as being required here:

= Additional event information is required for MIS. Therefore the details of which
events are to be harvested and how they are to be transformed needs to be refined.

The following additional events are required: [BT1 10]

Note that additional Product Ids will need to be provided by Post Office Ltd onto
which these Event Ids should be mapped by the agent. These Product Ids will be
formally defined in [{MISAJS} [RDMIG] once they have been allocated by the Post
Office Reference Data team.

= In order to support the generation of individual Transactions for POL FS, it is
necessary to pick up the various Reference attributes if they are present.

Reference attributes will be present on Remittance Balancing transactions (in
Attribute <EPOSSTransaction.BlackBoxData.PouchId:>) and also for Transaction
Corrections (in Attributes <EPOSSTransaction.BlackBoxData.Ref:> and
<EPOSSTransaction.BlackBoxData.AddRef:>)

Three new columns will be required in the EPOSSTransaction interface tables,
Pouchld, Ref and AddRef into which these are harvested.

= The TPS Harvester currently has a fairly complex mechanism by which it calculates
the CAP and BP of a Transaction based on the rollover markers that delineate
when the CAP and BP change for any Stock Unit. This mechanism will need to be
retained while data is still being passed to OPTIP, however once the branches are
no longer operating on CAPs, it will no longer be sensible to report on this.

Therefore, it is proposed that an additional check is included in the TPS Harvester.
When the Stock Unit Persistent Object is retrieved in order to calculate the CAP
and BP a check is made as to whether that Stock Unit is currently operating in
Cash Account or a Branch Trading Period mode. If the Stock Unit is operating in
a Branch Trading Period mode, the Stock Unit Persistent Object will contain an
attribute <Data.TP:> with a non-null value. In this case no further attempt should
be made to calculate CAP or BP and values of zero-NULL should be input into the
TPS Interface tables. Note that if no Stock Unit Persistent Object is found (for
example because it has been deleted since the transaction took place), then again
values of zero should be returned. If TPS is in the early stages of migration, then
this will result in the Transaction being handled as an Exception, but that is no
different to what happens at present.

= Currently the CAPTrailer message is picked up in order to harvest Cash Account
related data. If the branch is operating in Branch Trading Period mode, (identified
by the presence of an attribute <Data.TP:> with a non-null value in the
EPOSSCAP Office Persistent Object) then no further processing is required.

2.5.2.5 DRS Host

The following changes are needed here:
= Remove reporting based on CAP (eg NB103) [BT062]

Dev are concerned that POL haven't thought through the full implications on this on the POL
Reconciliation processes.

The specific sections are 2, 3, 4, 5, 8,9, 10 & 11.

No change will be made to these reports for Impact R3.

We should look at removing this column in a future release, but leave it there for Impact R3.

= The DRS function that copies in data from TPS Host about Cash Account Delivery
to POL needs to stop doing that. Note that the function cannot be removed
altogether since it also copies in data on non-polled offices and it is assumed that
this is still required.

This is achieved without changing the DRS code since no attempt is made to copy
data for NULL cash accounts.

Other than that the reconciliation process remains unchanged. [BT059]

It is expected that all these changes can be achieved through standing data and
Maestro changes and no code changes are actually required. See [DRSHLD] for
details. [DRSREP] describes the changes to the DRS Reports.

2.5.2.6 APS Host

No changes are needed here.

This supports part of the Business Processes Deliver Data to External Systems.

This process takes the transactions and events from the Temporary Transaction Store
and passes them to POL MIS in a file as described in section 3.2.7. [BT043]

This process will be similar to the current process that produces the Transaction Files
for OPTIP, however the file format has changed as described in section 3.2.7. One
further change is that Settlement Transactions are not to be passed through to MIS.
Settlement Transactions are identified by having an Attribute Transfer_Txn_To_MIS
set in the Product Reference Data for the Product.

2.5.2.8 Transaction Summarisation

This functionality will be done within the TPS Host system.
This supports the Business Processes Accumulate Transactions for Summarisation.

Currently this is being done at the Branch and the summaries are harvested into TPS
for passing onto POL FS.

There is no specific requirement on Fujitsu to make the changes in this area, This is because
we have chosen to do this as it makes the overall system simpler.

However what is now proposed is a new Summarisation function at the Data Centre

that will run as part of the normal overnight processing after the day’s data has been

harvested.

Summarisation is a three-stage process:

= Initial Summarisation of Product and Mode

= Summarisation for POL FS

= Summarisation for HR SAP

These are discussed further below.

2.5.2.8.1 Initial Summarisation of Product and Mode

All Transactions are summarised by Product / Mode combinations such that for cach
Branch and Trading Day there is a single Summary Record for each combination of
Product / Mode that has taken place during the Trading Day. So as to support
Migration (see section 2.6.3.1.3), separate summaries are produced for each CAP, thus
enabling those transactions produced prior to Migration Point 30 to be separated from
those that take place after this point.

Note that those Product / Mode combinations that are defined in the POL FS
Summarisation Reference Data as needing to be passed through to POL FS at a
transaction level are not summarised, but passed through as individual transactions into
the intermediate summarisation tables.

2.5.2.8.2 Summarisation for POL FS

A further set of summarisation, based on Reference Data, then maps the Product /
Mode summaries for each Branch / Trading Day onto the data to be passed to the
relevant POL FS Accounts (based on Articles).

Only Initial Summaries for a CAP greater than the CAP that triggers Point 30 are
considered. All other initial summaries are ignored by this process.

The rules for Summarisation are as follows:

1) For each set of Transactions that have been summarised by Horizon Product
and Mode they can be further summarised as follows:
a) Reference Data will define the Article associated with the given
Horizon Product.
b) This Article will have associated one or mode Article Modes
corresponding to the Horizon Mode under which the Product was
transacted.

c) If there is a single Article Mode for all Modes, then that Article Mode is
used to accumulate the details for all the transactions for that Horizon
Product

d) If there are a number of different Article Modes for different Modes,
then the appropriate one is used to accumulate the details for all the
transactions for that Horizon Product carried out in the appropriate
Mode

* Post Office doesn’t roll over for several weeks and so TPS Harvester generates a zero CAP / BP
¢ Delete Stock Unit results in a zero CAP / BP

+ BdC problem where Reference Data allows a currency to be transacted, but First Rate doesn't provide a spot
rate for that currency.

2.5.2.8.3

2) If the Article Mode is described as being “non-summarised”, then the
underlying transactions need to be preserved without being summarised.

3) A number of attributes are associated with the Article Mode and these will
need to be passed to POL FS with the associated Records.

A potential problem is that some transactions will have failed Harvesting and will
subsequently be passed through when they are repaired.

Recent analysis shows a number of causes:

In all these cases the transactions would be OK as far as Summarisation is concerned. It is
proposed that these constraints are removed (see section 2.5.2.14). However Summarisation
will need to allow for potential errors.

The current frequency of such problems is about once per week so they can be handled
manually by the SSC.

In order to handle the case where Transactions are known to be missing (ie they have
failed harvesting), then there is no point in attempting to produce a sub-file for passing
to POL FS since it will be incomplete. Such cases can be detected by examining the
TPS Harvester Exceptions tables. Should any Transactions be in these tables, the
summaries should be held back for processing on a subsequent day when the
exceptions have been processed. A mechanism is required to take the corrected
exceptions and add them into the appropriate summaries.

A check is also required that all the data in a sub-file has a net value of zero. Should
this not be the case, then an exception needs to be raised and the summaries held back
until a correcting transaction is generated to enable the sub-file to balance correctly.

In theory this can't happen, however in practice there could be bugs in the system or perhaps
even Reference Data errors that will cause this to occur. Therefore we need to allow for it.

We don't want to repeat the mistakes we made with the original TPS processing where we
assumed that such errors couldn’t happen!

James has confirmed that this holding back of sub-files is unlikely to give us SLA problems,

Assumption recorded in section 8.4

Summarisation for HR SAP

Only Initial Summaries for a CAP greater than the CAP that triggers Point 30 are
considered. All other initial summaries are ignored by this process.

A separate set-ef summarisation, again based on Reference Data, maps the Product /
Mode summaries for each Branch / Trading Day onto the data required for HR SAP
based on CTT Numbers. Note that not all Branches are required for HR SAP
summarisation (though it may be simpler to summarise for all branches and discard
those not required when the interface is built for HR SAP each month, since the

numbers of branches not required are fairly low - it is the Directly Managed Branches
of which there are about 600).

Since [HRSAPAIS1] requires the data passed across to be predominantly positive (ie
for both in-pay and out-pay transactions to be passed as positive counts, and only
having negative amounts where any reversals / corrections exceed the number of actual
transactions). In order to achieve this the accounting sense of the product needs to be
ascertained from the product Reference Data and those transactions identified as out-
pay transactions need to have their signs reversed as part of the summarisation
process. [PSO_CR00275 3843]

It is proposed that sets of summarisations are held for each branch for each target Pay
Period (as defined in Reference Data). Each day, the intermediate summaries
(described in section 2.5.2.8.1) are added into the set of summaries for the appropriate
Pay Period based on the Trading Date for which the transactions making up the
summaries took place. Note that for some CTT numbers and HR SAP Groups
(specifically Lottery transactions for franchised offices), the summaries will need to be
added into an earlier Pay Period than others. This will be defined as part of the
mapping Reference Data.

Any corrected Transactions (following Harvesting exceptions) also need to be added
into the appropriate set of summaries based on their Trading Date:

Note that once a set of summaries has been sent to HR SAP, they will be marked as
such and any attempt to add further data into those summaries should result in the data
being included in the next period. This should only happen if a branch has been non-
polled for a significant period and so should be very rare.

2.5.2.9 Accept CAPO Data

The requirement for this has been removed and so the rest of this section has been deleted.

2.5.2.10 Generate HR SAP Info

This functionality will be done within the TPS Host system. [BT 112]
This supports part of the Business Processes Deliver Data to External Systems.

Currently, Postmasters pay is calculated based on the work that they did 2 months ago
other than for Lottery Transactions, where it is based on the work done in the previous
month. In order to support this, data about transactions undertaken during a pay
period are passed to HR SAP each month to support a run of the payroll system. An
added complication is that for those branches where the contract is with a separate
organisation (such as Tescos) rather than an individual, the data has to be made
available to HR SAP in a separate file for a separate payroll run.

POL are planning to simplify this such that all Postmasters / multiples will be paid
based on the previous months trading data. However it is not yet agreed when this
might happen, so we have designed the summarisation and file generation mechanisms
to support the current interface.

The summarisation process (including any complexities associated with accounting for
Lottery transactions “early”) is described in section 2.5.2.8.3. This process is purely

concerned with the ability to generate the two separate files each month to contain the
data for the relevant branches.

A single file generation process is required which will generate any file currently due,
however-a-parameter-will be-required-indieating (whether to-prod he-files for
the “multiples” or for the bulk of the branches). The format of both files is defined in
[HRSAPAIS1].

This parameter will also control which branches should be included in the selection of
summarisation data. The identification of Branches into these two categories (or as
not required for HR SAP) will be done through Reference Data.

There is no requirement to consider the case of a branch changing its categorisation
during a month. In order to detect the situation where data comes from branches after
the data has been sent to HR SAP, the process should mark all summaries that have
been sent to HR SAP thus enabling the summarisation process to include them in the
next period’s summaries. All data should be sent even if a branch has been closed.

It is assumed that this doesn’t give us a problem in terms of Reference Data having removed a
closed branch. In particular the branch would be marked as ‘Closed’ rather than being
physically removed.

Generate POL FS Info

There is no specific requirement on Fujitsu to make the changes in this area. This is because we
have chosen to do this as it makes the overall system simpler.

This functionality will be done within the TPS Host system.
This supports part of the Business Processes Deliver Data to External Systems.

A set of files is required to be generated each night for passing to POL FS. The
structure of the file is basically the same as for S60, however the detailed record
formats have changed. Instead of building up the summaries at the counter and
passing them straight through to the file generation function, the summarisation will
now take place at the Data Centre. Some transactions (as defined in Ref Data) will
still need to be passed through “un-summarised”. All records for a single Branch /
Trading Day should have a net value of zero. This needs to be checked as part of the
file generation process and exceptions should be raised if that isn’t the case.

In order to support SLA Monitoring, information needs to be passed to the POA Data

Transactions associated with these sub-files. The—caleulati fh iber—of

This component takes the file produced each night by POL FS of Transaction
Corrections and passes them on to the specified Branch. [BT113] The file is described
in section 3.2.2

This is a standard File Load and Distribute process very similar to that used for LFS
Planned Orders and Replenishment Deliveries.

In addition to loading the data some mapping is required based on Reference Data (see
section 3.5).

This mapping will be used to convert the Article and Instruction fields of the
Transaction Correction into the corresponding Horizon Products. Checks are also
done that the resulting Horizon Products can be transacted for the amounts specified in
any of the Modes that are defined as part of the Transaction Correction.

In addition the Allowed Modes field needs to be mapped through to the list of actual
modes that are allowed to simplify the branch processing.

Any failures from the above checks will result in the failing Transaction Correction
being rejected, but the remaining ones being processed as normal. Failures in the File
Header or Trailer will result in the entire file being rejected.

Note that some of these checks are not currently defined in [TCAIS], therefore a CR
will need to be raised to update the AIS once the detailed design for this function has
been done. This is covered in PSO_CRO00264 (CP 3844)

2.5.2.13 POA Data Warehouse

There is no specific requirement on Fujitsu to make the changes in this area. However there
are requirements for us to measure and monitor various SLA and this work is in support of this.

The POA Data Warehouse will need to be aware of all file deliveries that we need to
monitor. Each interface needs to be considered separately in the following
subsections:

= POLFS File Delivery (Outbound)

a MIS File Delivery (Outbound)

= CTS File Delivery (Outbound)

m_ FRTS File Delivery (Outbound)

= HR SAP File Delivery (Outbound)

= Transaction Corrections File Delivery (Inbound)

2.5.2.13.1 POL FS File Delivery

What is needed here is to report on how many transactions that were harvested into
TPS and aggregated to create the individual sub-files that have been successfully
passed to POL FS each day in time for loading.

In order to measure the delivery, TPS must provide the Data Warehouse with a file of
records in the following format:

In order that this information can be compiled, TPS must record the number of

addition, when TPS copies the file to POL FS, an acknowledgement record must be
generated by-FPS that confirms the date/time that each sub-file was delivered to POL

2.5.2.14 TPS Host

A number of changes are required here:

m Since the Transactions for dummy Settlement Products will now be harvested in
order to support the POL FS Information flow, then it will be necessary to
explicitly suppress this data on the flow to OPTIP. This is done in the same way as
on the POL MIS flow (see section 2.5.2.7)

m= The new events being harvested by the TPS Harvester (see Table 26 in
section 2.5.2.4) must not be passed through to OPTIP. Therefore the process that
generates the file for OPTIP needs to suppress those events should they be
harvested.

= In order to support the new Transaction Modes introduced by Transaction
Correction processing the check constraint "Transaction_Mode_Id in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
7, 8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28)"
will change to include new modes (29,30,31,32,33,34) to the list.

This change will affect all transaction tables and take place at Migration Point 10.

= In order to simplify TPS Host processing the following check constraints will be
added (at Migration Point 10):

o "TRADING_DATE" is not null
This change will affect all Transaction and Event tables.

= In order to reduce the number of TPS Harvester Exceptions, which will result in
failures to deliver data to POL FS, a review is required of the constraints on the
TPS Harvester Interface tables, thus allowing some Transactions that are currently
handled as exceptions through to the main TPS system for processing.

It is proposed that the following constraints are removed at point 40 in the
migration process (see also section 2.6):

o “BALANCE PERIOD" is not null

a balance_period >= 0

a "CASH_ACCOUNT_PERIOD" is not null
a cash_account_period >= 0

This change will affect all Transaction tables.

SSC see the above constraints as the primary candidates for causing harvester exceptions
They also see missing Start Date for causing a small number of harvester exceptions in the
past. But this check constraint must be kept as the Agents usually derive the missing value of
Start Dates

It will not be possible to relax all constraints on the TPS Harvester interface tables,
so this means that the Transaction Summarisation Function will need to be able to

handle such cases (see also section 2.5.2.8). Since the current failure rate is very
low (about I per week), it is proposed that this change to the constraints is done as
part of the switching of the interface from OPTIP to POL MIS thus avoiding the
need to filter out such transactions from the flow to OPTIP.

This has the effect of potentially increasing the number of failures in transaction summarisation
during the period when data is being sent to POL FS and to OPTIP, however given the expected
frequency at which such problem occur, this should be OK operationally.

See also section 2.6.3.1.1

= TPS is involved in a number of reconciliation processes. In general, these should
continue as they are [BT059]. Specifically:

a The APS Transactions should be generated as at present for passing to the APS
reconciliation system

a The checks on the Branch Reconciliation Totals generated at EOD should
continue

However the calculation of the “mini cash account” to reconcile against the
Branch’s Cash Account summaries can be removed from the code. There is no
longer a requirement to support this functionality during the early stages of Impact
R3.

= Changes are required on the current interface of Bureau transactions to FRTS,
since the control file includes summaries based on CAP.

The working assumption is that we should summarise by Margin Product and
Transaction Mode Code (ie ignore CAP)

Note that the transactional data flow to the POA Data Warehouse remains unchanged.
Similarly, the CTS file will continue to be delivered unchanged, though it will no
longer be co-ordinated with the other OPTIP files.

2.6 MIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS

The requirements for migration require further work. This section has made a number of
assumptions as to how it will work. Should these assumptions be incorrect, then CRs will be
raised when a full migration design has been agreed.

There are a number of assumption in this section which are recorded in section 8.4

2.6.1 Migration Overview

Figure 1 is adapted from [CDBT] and shows a timeline for the different aspects of
migration. This diagram has been expanded in [MIGSTGY] to include POL FS
activities as well, however the simpler diagram is sufficient for this DP.

Figure 6 — Migration Timeline

Migration will occur over a period of time. The key migration points are:

= Data Centre Migration (Point 10)

= Counter Software Upgrade (Point 20)

= Switch to new POL FS Interface (Point 25)

= Running the Final Counter Cash Account for CBDB (Point 30)

= Switch of TMS feed of Transactions from OPTIP to MIS (Point 40)

= Delayed-Count feware- Upsrade (Point 45)

= Upgrade of Counter processes to operate Branch Trading Statement (Point 50)

([BT114]

These are described in more detail below.
2.6.1.1 Data Centre Migration

This will be the normal upgrade process that takes place over a single weekend. It will
ensure that all the Data Centre Systems are able to support the new functionality, while
also retaining support for the existing functionality, prior to it being switched off.

Once this migration has taken place, it will be possible to receive the additional
Reference Data required to support the new functionality from NRDS and to distribute
it as required.

It is expected that NRDS will have been upgraded prior to this point so that the new
Reference Data can be prepared, thus enabling the new Reference Data to be
distributed as soon as the Horizon Data Centre is migrated. However until this point
the pre-S80 interface will be supported by NRDS in delivering Reference Data to
Horizon.

2.6.1.2 Counter Software Upgrade

This will follow the normal pattern for a Software rollout and include some initial trial
Branches to ensure that the process runs smoothly, prior to rolling the software out to
the full estate. Some of the new functionality will become active as soon as the Branch
is upgraded, while other functions will be controlled by a Soft Launch mechanism and
so be activated at a later time.

2.6.1.3 Switch to new POL FS Interface

In order to support a possible pilot of POL FS for full Impact R3 functionality, then it
is necessary to continue supporting the Impact R1 interface to POL FS until the pilot is
complete. This allows TPS to support both flows in parallel. This delay in switching
the interface also allows time for the new Summarisation Reference Data to be
distributed from NRDS to Horizon.

Once the pilot is complete it is then necessary to switch to using the Impact R3
interface prior to the new data being generated.

This point is chosen so as to ensure that it occurs before any Branches are trading in
the CAP following the CAP that triggers Point 30. It is Post Office Ltd’s
responsibility to ensure that no Branch is running too many CAPs ahead of where it
should be. It is expected that setting this point 2 weeks before the scheduled Point 30
is sufficient to achieve this.

Should any Branch have rolled over into the CAP following Point 30 prior to this
point, then the Opening Figures and initial transactions for that Branch are likely to be
incorrect and will have to be manually corrected. It is Post Office Ltd’s responsibility
to make any such corrections in POL FS.

2.6.1.4 Running the Final Counter Cash Account for CBDB

It is a requirement of the POL FS designers that the switch over of the accounts from
CBDB to POL FS occurs at a single point in time, which coincides with a POL Month
End. [BT003] A specific Cash Account Week will be identified such that once that
Cash Account has been produced, all subsequent transactions will be summarised and
passed to POL FS. In addition a special migration flow of data will be required to pass
the Closing Figures from that Cash Account through to POL FS as Opening Figures
for the corresponding accounts.

POL will be required to ensure that all Branches generate this Cash Account on time.
This will ensure that we have a clean cutover.

There will also be some minor changes to the menu structures, particularly under the
Housekeeping menu at this point. Other than that, this should be invisible to Branch
staff.

As far as the Data Centre is concerned, this is the point at which the new Impact
Release 3 data is first sent to POL FS.

There may need to be an earlier pilot of a small number of branch's data to a test POL FS.
Should such a pilot be supported, then there will need to be a period of a few days between

ending the pilot and switching to the new interface to POL FS. The design will only support
such a pilot while we are passing Live Data to the Live POL FS using the Impact R1 interface.

We have only provided for supporting the pilot in our development costs. No operational or
test support has been included since the migration strategy is not clear.

Assumption recorded in section 8.4

Switch of TMS feed of Transactions from OPTIP to MIS

Once all Cash Account data from the final cash account has been successfully passed
to OPTIP, the Transactional flow to OPTIP can be discontinued and replaced by the
new flow to MIS.

This should be invisible to Branch staff.

In addition there are various other changes to the Horizon Host systems to complete
the migration process at this point.

This point also indicates that migration to POL FS is complete, so process used during
the migration can be stopped at this point. From this point onwards, the Data Centre
is operating the complete Impact R3 functionality.

Upgrade of Counter processes to operate Branch Trading Statement

At some later time the branches need to switch to using the new processes. This can
be done by different branches at different times, thus allowing a pilot to be supported.
However the changes in process at any branch need to occur immediately after rolling
over into a new Cash Account Period.

This will be achieved by introducing a new type of “Soft Launch” which will be
triggered as part of the rollover process to a specified Cash Account Period. This is
known as a “Rollover Triggered Soft Launch”.

2.6.3 Specific Migration Developments
This section has been restructured and so no attempt has been made to explicitly mark
deletions. New text is marked where possible.
As can be seen from Table 33, a number of migration activities need to take place
other than as part of the normal Software introduction changes.
These are:
= Data Centre Changes
o Switch on Transaction Correction Feed
a Switch the POL FS Feed from Impact Release 1 to Impact Release 3 interface
and generate Opening Balances where required
a Switch of TMS feed of Transactions from OPTIP to MIS
o Generate HR SAP Info
= Counter Changes
o Process the final cash account for CBDB
ca Upgrade of Counter processes to operate Branch Trading Statement
co Merging of Non-Value and Value Stock
a Support of nRDS supported Settlement Products
a Support for Quiescent Rollover
co MiMAN change
o Reprinting Reports
These are described further below
2.6.3.1 Data Centre Changes

The simplest way to describe the specific migration considerations is to go through the
Migration Points in turn.

2.6.3.1.1 Point 10

At this point all new Data Centre processes are delivered and a Maestro scheduled is
produced that will run all the relevant process. However some processes will be
designed such that they will test a TPS System Variables to decide at which point in
the migration process the system is and where appropriate exit without doing any
further processing. This approach avoids the need to provide and test a number of
different Maestro schedules during the migration period.

2.6.3.1.2 Support of a POL FS Pilot
We are required to support a pilot of the migration to POL FS.

CP 3870 has been raised to capture the costs for achieving a Cut-over Rehearsal. The
proposed approach is as follows:

m The Live Maestro schedule is changed to take an export of key TPS Host tables
each night from Point 10 to Point 40.

= On 4 consecutive nights these exports are take from the TPS Host and copied to
exchangeable media

a The media is transported to FELO1

a The data is loaded onto the V&I Test TPS Host (one day at a time)

= The POL FS interface files are produced and written to exchangeable media
a The media is transported to Wigan

u The Data is loaded onto a test instance of POL FS

No formal request has been received from Post Office Ltd for such a Rehersal, so it is
outside the scope of this version of the DP.

2.6.3.1.4

= The interface to POL FS is switched from the Impact Release 1 interface to the
Release 3 interface.

= Transaction Summarisation within TPS starts at this point. However in order to
support the migration requirements, the Initial Summarisation (described in
section 2.5.2.8.1) will produce separate summaries for each CAP within a Branch
and Trading Date.

= The normal Summarisation processes for POL FS and HR SAP (described in
sections 2.5.2.8.2 and 2.5.2.8.3 will restrict themselves to those initial summaries
where the CAP is greater than that defined as triggering Point 30, or as being
NULL (indicating that the branch has passed Point 50)

Due to still having the full TPS Harvester constraints until migration point 40, there will be an
increased likelihood of Summarisation failures during this early period.

Assumed to be acceptable.

= From this point onwards, HR SAP summarisation and File generation can operate
in “final form”.

= A separate POL FS Summarisation Process is provided that will summarise all
Cash and near-cash data from the Initial Summaries which have a CAP of less than
or equal to the CAP that triggers Point 30 and generate an appropriate balancing
transaction, thus ensuring that the Impact Release one subset of data continues to
be passed to POL FS at this time. In order to support this a special set of “S60
mappings” will be defined as standing data within POL FS. This mapping will be
based on [POLFSMAP].

= In order to provide Opening Figures for POL FS, a further process is provided that
will take details from the Cash Account produced at the end of the CAP that
triggers Point 30 and generate the Opening Figures for all Stock, Suspense and
Discrepancy products other than those such as Cash and Cheques which are
already known to POL FS from Impact Release 1.

= Since CBDB is not concerned with any Cash Accounts beyond Point 30, the TPS
function that passes Cash Accounts through to OPTIP will suppress any Cash
Accounts for a CAP greater than Point 30. This is necessary since Point 40 is
likely to be over a week after Point 30.

Point 40

This is the point where a migration from CBDB to POL FS can be considered to be
complete from a Horizon Perspective.

Specifically:
= The migration process for POL FS (described above) can be withdrawn
= Switch of TMS feed of Transactions from OPTIP to MIS

2.6.3.2 Counter Changes
2.6.3.2.1 Process the final cash account for CBDB

In general this phase should have minimal impact on the branch processes. However
there are some changes required to the menu structures at this point. These changes
will be triggered by a new type of Soft Launch which is invoked as a result of the
Stock Unit or Branch rolling over into a specified CAP number defined in the Soft
Launch Reference Data.

This CAP will be flagged as requiring a Rollover Triggered Soft Launch (see
section 2.6.3.2.5). This will ensure that the soft launch functionality is triggered
correctly.

It is expected that the same CAP will trigger this change across the full estate.
The changes that need to happen at this point are:

a The report changes to include a week number (see section ) will take effect at this
point. [PSO_CR00271 3888]

2.6.3.2.2 Upgrade of Counter processes to operate Branch Trading Statement

This is where the main changes occur at the Branch. Again it is triggered by a Soft
launch product linked to a given CAP. It is expected that in this case, different
branches will migrate at different CAPs.

The process is expected to operate as follows:

= Each Stock Unit will rollover into a new “CAP” following the pre-S80 processes.

Version 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

As part of this rollover a new flag needs to be included in the Stock Unit Persistent
Object to indicate that this Stock Unit is now operating in Branch Trading Period
mode rather than Cash Account mode. This flag is needed so that other processes
such as the TPS Harvester can tell in which mode this Stock unit is operating.

This CAP will be flagged as requiring a Rollover Triggered Soft Launch (see
section 2.6.3.2.5). This will ensure that the soft launch functionality is triggered
correctly.

= When all Stock Units have rolled over in this way (including inactive Stock Units),
the Office can then be rolled over into the new CAP and produce the final Cash
Account Report.

= From this point onwards, all reports will be in their new format and any
functionality identified as “Point 50” in Table 33 will be made available. In
particular the buttons used to invoke the non-value stock functions will be
removed.

2.6.3.2.3 Merging of Non-Value and Value Stock

This can be seen as a product introduction / change process. It is not expected that
any changes in functionality are required, however there will be changes to Reference
Data. Further analysis may be required on a product by product basis to sort out the
exact consequences.

This should be handled as an OBC change once all branches are operating on the new
processes. Any changes other than those handled through the normal OBC process are
currently out of scope. [BT055]}

This is discussed in section 2.5.1.1.3 and there are some outstanding issues to be resolved
before I can consider this further.

Assumed out of scope.

2.6.3.2.4 Support of nRDS supported Settlement Products

There is probably no migration development required here as such, however there is a
need to identify exactly how this migration is to take place.

The current state is that we have Type C Reference Data that defines the current
Settlement Products with appropriate Product Mappings. We also have Product Mode

smoothly: There should be no need to co-ordinate this in terms of CAPs since both
products should have identical mapping s and so will be treated identically. In
particular this change can take place while the counter is still at S75 (and in fact the
migration is simplest if this is the case).

2.1.1.1.5 Support for Rollover Triggered Soft Launch

A new technique is introduced, that of a Rollover Triggered Soft Launch. What this
means is that once a Stock Unit has rolled over into a specified CAP, the soft launch
mechanism is invoked so as to update the Horizon Menus to reflect the changes that
are required at that point.

It is proposed that this will operate as follows:

= The CAP for which this rollover is to apply is defined in Reference Data using the
standard Soft Launch control mechanisms.

= Whenever a Stock Unit completes a CAP rollover or a user logs in or is attached
to a different Stock Unit, the Soft Launch mechanism is invoked to ensure that the
correct Horizon Menus are displayed according to whether the Stock Unit is
operating before or after the “target CAP”.

Full details how this is achieved are described in [MIGOVW].

Note that if there are multiple Soft Launch products for Point 50, only the earliest
CAP will be used and the others will be ignored.

2.1.1.1.6 MiMAN change

Although the changed way of operating MiMAN will take effect from Point 20, there
is one significant impact on Migration. MiMAN will need to decide whether the
branch is to initially operate in Cash Account or Branch Trading Mode when it first
initialises the branch.

The way in which this is done is as follows

= Check to see if there is a cash account calendar present in Reference Data. If there
isn’t then we must be in a later year and so should operate in Branch Trading
Mode

a Check to see if there is an active Point 50 Soft Launch product for this branch. If
not we should operate in Cash Account Mode

= If there is check the CAP associated with that Soft Launch product and decide if
the dates for that CAP in the CAP calendar are before or after “today”. If the CAP
is in the future, then we should operate in Cash Account Mode, otherwise we
should operate in Branch Trading Mode.

2.1.1.1.7 Reprinting Reports

Report reprinting is fully covered by section 2.5

Data Model
3.1 GENERAL
Figure I shows the interfaces between Horizon and other components involved in
Impact Release 3 and the breakdowns in Figure 2 to Figure 5 show the interfaces
between the components of Horizon. Figure 5 also shows some data stores. These
Interfaces and Data stores represent the Data Model. They can be divided into
External interfaces, Internal interfaces and Data Stores:
= External Interfaces
These are described in section 3.2
a Reference Data (section 3.2.1)
a Client Access (out of scope)
co Bank Statements (out of scope)
a Transaction Corrections (section 3.2.2)
a SAP ADS Transactions and Summaries (out of scope)
o Ledger Entry Information (section 3.2.4)
a TMS Info from Clients (out of scope)
co Remuneration Information (section 3.2.6)
ca Management Info (section 3.2.7)
a CTS File (section 3.2.8)

o Stock Unit Summary for Branch Trading Report (section 3.4.1)
Finally section 3.5 describes the dependencies on Reference Data.
3.2 EXTERNAL INTERFACES
3.2.1 Reference Data
Changes will be required to [RDSAIS] to include the changes to Reference Data
described in section 3.5.
3.2.2 Transaction Corrections
This is a new data flow from POL FS to Horizon giving details of Error Notices that
are to be distributed to the branches to be actioned.
The interface will be an overnight file from POL FS containing all the Error Notices to
be distributed for that day. Feedback will be provided to POL FS via transactions in
the normal Ledger Entry Information flow (see section 3.2.4),
The interface is formally defined in [TCAIS].
3.2.3 SAP ADS Transactions and Summaries
POL have dropped the requirement for this, so remainder of section has been deleted without
being marked as such.
3.2.4 Ledger Entry Information
This is primarily an expansion of the summarised financial information being passed to
POL FS at RI to cover all Horizon products rather than just cash and near cash
products. However the details format of the data has changed.
The interface is formally defined in the AIS [POLFSAIS].
3.2.5 TMS Info from Clients
POL have dropped the requirement for this, so remainder of section has been deleted without
being marked as such.
3.2.6 Remuneration Information
This is the interface to HR SAP and is formally defined in [HRSAPAIS1] which is
based on [HRSAPAIS].
At the time this DP was originally produced, [HRSAPAIS1] was not available and so a
number of assumptions were made about the interface (documented below). Now that
[HRSAPAIS1] has been produced, they have all been confirmed as correct:
= That data will be provided one or two months in arrears as specified in the
summarisation Reference Data.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

= Two separate interfaces will be used:
a An initial feed for “multiples” (about 250 branches)
a_ A full feed for other sub-post offices (about 16,000 branches)

Reference Data will be used to identify in which feed the data for a branch is to be
included. Note that some branches (Directly Managed Branches) are not included
in either feed.

= There is no requirement to migrate a branch from one feed to the other.

= That any migration to the target situation of data being passed across as a single
feed, 1 month in arrears is out of scope of Impact S80 and will be handled by a
separate CR, though the design should take into account the fact that this is likely
to be required in future.

= It is assumed that a Calendar will be provided via Reference Data defining the cut-
off dates for summarisation and also the dates at which files will be sent to HR
SAP.

= It is assumed that the mapping of products to CTTs will be provided by Reference
Data. This mapping will also indicate whether the summary is to be passed to HR
SAP one or two months in arrears.

= It is assumed that it is acceptable to use the Reference Data currently available at
the Data Centre at the time the Transaction is harvested for the Summarisation and
that there is no requirement to maintain historical mapping data associated with the
time that the transaction was actually carried out should that be differed (eg
following non-polling)

= It is assumed that not all transactions will be mapped to a CTT, and so no checking
is required regarding transactions that are not mapped to any CTT number as part
of the summarisation process.

3.2.7 Management Info
The starting point for this is the current OPTIP AIS and is formally defined in
[TIPAIS]. A new AIS has been produced defining this interface [MISAIS].
The following summarises the main changes from [TIPAIS] to [MISAIS]:
= Changes due to removal of the Cash Account
The CAP and BP fields will be removed retained rth te i-be-null

= Additional Transactional Information

There are a number of the more recent “specialised” transactions where all that is
passed to OPTIP is the basic EPOSS Transactional Data. Sections B5 and Bo of
[MISAIS] define the additional data required.

It has also been agreed that the Quantity field can be extended to accommodate
Bureau Quantities rather than having to hold it as an additional field.

= Additional Event Information

Section B7.2 of [MISAIS] identifies some additional events that are to be passed
through to MIS. This is also defined in Table 26.

= Rules for Signs

All Transactions are now to be passed to POL MIS with the signs used on the
Horizon Counter rather than as predominantly positive (which is how it is specified
in [TIPAIS]). [PSO_CR00272 3843]

= Record Identifiers changes

Record Identifiers have been changed to reflect the Additional Transactional
Information provided. [PSO_CR00272 3843]

3.2.8 CTS Files
The starting point for this is the current OPTIP AIS and is formally defined in
[TIPAIS]. A new AIS has been produced defining this interface [CTSAIS].

The CTS file is currently delivered as part of the current OPTIP set of files as a
separate file. The file itself will remain unchanged.

3.3 INTERNAL INTERFACES

3.3.1 Branch to TMS: Transactions

This is the current flow of data to the TPS Harvester.

It may need some minor changes.
3.3.2 TMS to Branch: Transaction Corrections

This is a new data flow.
There are two aspects to this:

= The Oracle table structure used in TPS to make the Transaction Corrections
available to the Agent

This is documented in [TPSOTHER]
= The Attribute Grammar format used to hold the Transaction Correction in Riposte
This is documented in [CTRDEC]

Low level detail removed without marking.

3.3.3 Within Branch: Transactions

This is the current recording of EPOSS Transactions.

Environmental Constraints
41 GENERAL
The Impact Programme is primarily concerned with application changes and there are
no significant Infrastructure changes other than in terms of new / changed technical
interfaces to other systems. This chapter is concerned with describing these Technical
(as opposed to Application) Interface changes.
Information is also included about the operational schedule, SLAs and Volumes
associated with the interfaces, which although included in the AISs is more relevant to
this part of the document.
There are a number of aspects to this:
= Technical Interface from NRDS
= Technical Interfaces to and from POL FS
= Technical Interface to HR SAP
= Technical Interface to MIS
= Technical Interface to CTS
These are described further in the following subsections.
Since all of these interfaces are bulk file transmissions and most are from the Horizon
Data Centre to Huthwaite, then they will be formally defined in an update to
[POLTIS].
Assume this is the only TIS needed.
Assumption recorded in section 8.4
4.2 TECHNICAL INTERFACE FROM SAP ADS
POL have dropped the requirement for this, so remainder of section has been deleted without
being marked as such.
4.3 TECHNICAL INTERFACE FROM NRDS
The existing technical interface will remain unchanged.

4.4 TECHNICAL INTERFACES TO AND FROM POL FS
The technical interface that was introduced as part of Impact Release I will remain
unchanged.
However the volume of data will be increased significantly (since now all transactions
are summarised rather than just cash and near-cash movements) and there is a need to
measure delivery times to support SLA measurement (see section 5.5).
= These files need to be audited on despatch and receipt
This interface is no a fully two way interface in that it also needs to support the flow of
Transaction Corrections from POL FS to Horizon. The receipt of Transaction
Correction files needs to be monitored as follows:
= At least one file should be received every night Monday through to Saturday.
= More than one file may be received on any day and also a file may be received on a
Sunday night
= Should a file not be received when expected, then an alert needs to be raised so
that this can be investigated on the morning of the next working day. This alert
will be raised using the mechanism introduced for monitoring POL FS Error Files
at S60 in CP 3775. (Ie a message is written to the local application log which is
picked up by Systems Management and an Event is presented to SMC to process
according to KELs. A KEL would be provided to ensure that such an event
resulted in a call being raised on SSC to process on the next working day.)
[PSO_CR00276 3843]
4.5 TECHNICAL INTERFACE FROM EDS
POL have dropped the requirement for this, so remainder of section has been deleted without
being marked as such.
4.6 TECHNICAL INTERFACE TO HR SAP
This is a new interface.
It is assumed that we will send this file to the remote FTMS Server at Huthwaite.
The following assumptions are made:
= Approx Monthly File Size
0.9mb for the first interface (company franchises) and 30mb for the main interface
= Proposed Operational Schedule
Each month there will be two separate “pay runs”:
o At the beginning of the month to cover the “multiples”
a At the middle of the month to cover the bulk of the branches

Each “pay run” will take place over a weekend. The exact dates for these pay runs
and the range of Trading Days to be included in each pay run will be defined in a
Reference Data Calendar (see section 3.5). Data delivery should be by 21.30 on
the Friday preceding the pay run. Data must not be delivered more than a week
before hand. Therefore, to provide operational flexibility and opportunity to sort
out any unexpected problems it is proposed that the file is generated and sent a
configurable number of days before the required delivery date. This will initially be
set to 3 days beforehand (ie Tuesday).

For simplicity, this task will be scheduled to be invoked each day, and the first
check that is made is whether there is anything to be run. If not it will exit with a
response indicating that there was no work to do, thus allowing Maestro to by-pass
the remaining work associated with delivering the file.

= See section 5.5 for SLA requirements.

= These files need to be audited on despatch

4.7 TECHNICAL INTERFACE TO MIS
This is a new interface, however it is effectively the equivalent of the current OPTIP
Interface as defined in [POLTIS].
These files will be sent to the remote FTMS Server at Huthwaite.

At the time this DP was originally produced, [MISAIS] was not available and so a
number of assumptions were made about the interface (documented below). Now that
[MISAIS] has been produced, they have all been confirmed as correct:

= Approx Daily File Size is assumed to be the same as for [TIPAIS].
= Proposed Operational Schedule

These will be passed as soon as they are available and should be with MIS at a
similar time to them being passed to OPTIP now (normally before midnight)

= See section 5.5 for SLA requirements

= These files need to be audited on despatch

4.8 TECHNICAL INTERFACE TO CTS

This is a new interface, however it is effectively the equivalent of the current OPTIP
Interface as defined in [POLTIS].

It is assumed that we will send this file to the remote FTMS Server at Huthwaite.

At the time this DP was originally produced, [CTSAIS] was not available and so a
number of assumptions were made about the interface (documented below). Now that
[CTSAIS] has been produced, they have all been confirmed as correct:

a__ Approx Daily File Size: Assumed to be the same as for [TIPAIS].

Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 GENERAL
These can be broken down into a number of areas:
= Availability
= Usability
= Volumetrics
= Service Level Objectives
= Security
These are discussed in the following sections.
5.2 AVAILABILITY
None of the changes proposed will impact on the current systems availability and any
changes should be made in line with current practice, thus ensuring that systems
availability is not impacted.
5.2.1 Resilience
No special considerations are required for Resilience. Existing mechanisms within the
Host systems and agents will provide the necessary Resilience.
5.3 USABILITY
The changed counter processes will conform to the existing systems and any text
displayed to the clerk must be agreed with Post Office Ltd.
5.4 VOLUMETRICS
Volumetrics will be described in the relevant AISs. [VOLS] will be updated to include
the volumes associated with the new interfaces.
A key change here is the increased data retention period at the counter and the
Correspondence Server.

= SLAs being removed
= Unchanged SLAs
= Migration Implications
These are discussed in the following sections.
5.5.1 SLA Changes
I This section has now been updated to match Attachment 3 to [CT].
Section 11.3 of [CDBT] says the following about Service levels:
= LFS — remains unchanged
= TMS - POL-FS — to be consistent with that being developed for S60
= Transaction Correction — to be like Planned Orders — 95% by 08.00 and 100% by
24.00 — both Day A
= TMS -MIS (SAP ADS data) — by 05.00
Note that this data flow has been withdrawn as a result of [CDBTCR1] and so no SLT is
required.
= TMS - MIS (Horizon data) — by 03.00
= TMS ~—HRSAP 100% by 21.30 on Friday preceding weekend of pay run
= TMS (CTS file) — no SLA
Each of these statements is discussed separately in the following subsections.
In addition we will monitor the delivery of files to FRTS for completeness.
5.5.1.1 LFS
Stated Requirement: remains unchanged.
Proposal: There are no changes to the LFS interfaces (other than the removal of the
weekly Stock on hand files — see section 5.5.2), so no changes are needed here.
5.5.1.2 TMS - POL-FS

Stated Requirement: to be consistent with that being developed for S60.
For S60 there is no SLA on this interface and no measures are in place.

[CDPOLFS], however, says that the requirement is for Horizon to deliver the files to
POL FS by 03:00. Post Office Ltd has indicated that this should be taken as the SLA.

Proposal: The Service Level Target to be:
a 96% of Transactions to be delivered to POL FS by 03:00 on Day B
a 97% of Transactions to be delivered to POL FS by 03:00 on Day C
a 98% of Transactions to be delivered to POL FS by 03:00 on Day D

a 100% of Transactions to be delivered to POL FS by 03:00 on Day J

LDT is the same as SLT and ARL is 98% of Transactions to be delivered to POL
FS by 03:00 on Day D.
Remedies to be consistent with Data File delivery to TIP (as set out in Schedule
15, Annex 2, Paragraph 2.2.4)
5.5.1.3 Transaction Correction
Stated Requirement: to be like Planned Orders — 95% by 08.00 and 100% by 24.00 —
both Day A.
This SLT appears to have been based on the previous version of the Horizon
agreement whereas, the current SLT for Planned Orders reads:
Provided data delivered by 06:00 from SAP ADS:
a 90% by 08:00 on Day A
a 96% by 12:00 (noon) on Day A.
There is no LDT and ARL is 95% by 12:00 (noon) on Day A.
The requirement as stated is self-contradictory.
Proposal: Fujitsu will support a contractual SLT similar to that for Planned Orders
and Remedies to be consistent with LFS Remedies (as set out in Schedule 15, Annex
2, Paragraph 2.4.5.3), rather than that stated in the CD.
5.5.1.4 TMS — MIS (SAP ADS data)
POL have dropped the requirement for this, so remainder of section has been deleted without
being marked as such.
5.5.1.5 TMS — MIS (Horizon data)
Stated Requirement: by 03.00.
Proposal: Fujitsu to support an SLT similar to that for the current OPTIP delivery
namely:
co 96% of Transactions to be delivered to MIS by 03:00 on Day B
a 97% of Transactions to be delivered to MIS by 03:00 on Day C
a 98% of Transactions to be delivered to MIS by 03:00 on Day D
a 100% of Transactions to be delivered to MIS by 03:00 on Day J
However in this case there is no LDT and no ARL, and no Remedies apply.
5.5.1.6 TMS — HR SAP
Stated Requirement: 100% by 21.30 on Friday preceding weekend of pay run.
Given that the Friday that we need to load this data is beyond Day J for any of the relevant
data, then I don’t see any problem with this.

Fujitsu IMPACT Release 3 Design Proposal Ref.: EA/DPR/004
Services
Version 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004
Proposal: Fujitsu will support an SLT as follows:
That the file containing data for HR SAP is delivered to the Huthwaite remote
gateway by 21:30 on Friday preceding weekend of pay run, provided that the date
has been notified at least 2 weeks in advance.
CAPO data will not be included in this file as the interface with CAPO is currently
out of scope.
There should be no LDT but the ARL should be the same as the SLT.
Remedies: in the event of failure to achieve the ARL then Post Office shall be
entitled to recover Post Office Additional Costs from Fujitsu Services.
5.5.1.7 TMS (CTS file)
Stated Requirement: The overnight CTS file should be loaded onto the Horizon-Post
Office gateway by 07:307.
Proposal: This is an acceptable operational measure, subject to the following
qualification:
The measurement will be treated as design target with Fujitsu Services taking
responsibility for tuning the infrastructure to meet the design targets and discussing
any changes in infrastructure through the Capacity Management Service.
5.5.1.8 TMS (FRTS file)
In this case there is no formal requirement, however for completeness it is proposed
that we measure delivery of the overnight FRTS files against a target delivery time to
the Horizon-Post Office gateway of 07:30 on Day B.
5.5.2 SLAs to be removed
The following interfaces are removed as part of the introduction of Impact R3 and so
the associated SLAs need to be removed:
= LFS Weekly Stock on Hand feed is being removed
= OPTIP Feed is removed
= Network Banking Report NB 103
5.5.3 Unchanged SLAs
The following interfaces are unaffected by the introduction of Impact R3 and so the
associated SLAs are unchanged:
= Reference Data Delivery
= Delivery of Data to AP Clients
= Delivery of Network Banking Reports (other than NB103 which is being removed)
7 This requirement was not stated in [CDBT], but introduced as part of agreeing [CT]

5.5.4 Migration Implications
The SLA changes will take places at different times during the migration.
Section 2.6.1 defines the various migration stages.
The following table shows how the SLA changes fit in with this migration timetable:
Interface Point I Comment :
TMS - POL-FS 40 This SLT should commence after branch opening
positions are established on POL FS. The
introduction of this SLT should align with the ceasing
of the OpTIP SLT, i.e. there will only be one SLT or
the other SLT in operation at any one time.
Transaction Correction 40 Date to be agreed
NB Counter won't process them until Point 50.
TMS — MIS (Horizon data) 40 Date to be agreed
TMS — HR SAP Post 50 I Date to be agreed
May not start for a month or two.
LFS Weekly Stock on Hand 10 This interface is not currently used and so the SLT
should stop asap
OPTIP Feed 40 Date to be agreed
Network Banking Report NB 103 I 40 Date to be agreed
Table 34 — Migration of SLAs
5.6 SECURITY
None of the changes proposed will impact on the current systems security and any
changes should be made in line with current practice, thus ensuring that systems
security is not impacted.

Testing and Acceptance
6.1 GENERAL
Each element of the new solution will be tested independently based on their interface
specifications. Testing up to the service boundary between Fujitsu Services and Post
Office domain is assumed on the basis of DIT testing at the boundary.
[CDBT] specifies that an End to End test will also be required.
A Test Strategy will be produced defining in detail the testing that will be carried out
at the various stages. The results of tests will be made available to Post Office Ltd as
described in that Test Strategy.
6.2 PRODUCT TESTING
6.2.1 Test Stages
The following test stages will be applied to each component:
= Unit Testing - module testing
= Link test — testing the interaction between modules
= Product Introduction Test (PIT)
= Direct Interface Test (DIT) tests new or amended interfaces to internal or external
systems
In particular a number of DIT tests are required:
I’ve excluded any SAP Hosting interfaces
a Interface from NRDS to Horizon (Reference Data)
a Interface from TMS to POL FS (Summarised Transactions)
a Interface from POL FS to TMS (Transaction Corrections)
a Interface from TMS to MIS (Horizon Transactions)
a Interface from TMS to HR SAP (Postmaster Remuneration Data)
a Interface from TMS to POL (DRS Reports and CTS Reports)
= Business Integration Test (BIT) to prove the business integration of the various
components of the system on a live-like infrastructure
= Release Test (RT)
This also includes Migration Testing

Services
Version 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004
= Live Support Test (LST)
Note that LST does not include a POL FS system and so will not test any
interfaces to POL FS.
In addition there will be support for the Post Office End-to-End Testing. This will
include the use of a POL FS system and so can be used for any required testing of the
interface to POL FS.
6.2.2 Test Environments
No specific test environments or test harnesses are required. Since the new external
interfaces are Bulk File interfaces all that is required is the generation of these files and
the checking of the revised files that are transmitted.
6.3 ASPECTS TO BE TESTED
The following sub-sections are provided as input to the Test Strategy and are aligned
with the requirements of the Test Strategy.
Note that there will be a number of non-functional tests being carried out for the
Hosting of POL FS, however those are all outside the scope of this DP.
6.3.1 Business functionality
The Business Functionality is described in Chapter 2. All new Business Functionality
as described there will need to be explicitly tested.
Existing functionality needs to be regression tested to show that it hasn’t been changed
and that the service provided has not been degraded. [BT002]
6.3.2 Performance
The following needs to be considered for Performance Testing:
= Impact on overall Counter Performance, in particular the effect of the increase
from a I week CAP to a monthly Trading period and the corresponding increase in
message store sizes on the time for report production
= The time taken to summarise the transactions with the TPS Host prior to delivery
to POL FS
= The time taken to produce the monthly files for HR SAP
= Ability to deliver the various data flows within their targets
Note that it should be assumed that all counters will have been upgraded to 256Mb of
memory prior to the rollout of S80.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004
6.3.3 Volume
The main effect of Volumes is on the ability to summarise the Transactions prior to
delivery to POL FS. In addition need to consider the implications of the longer Data
Retention period on the counter and Correspondence Server.
The volume of data to be passed to MIS will be similar to that currently passed to
OPTIP.
6.3.4 Integrity
This cover auditing of the interfaces that are subject to DIT.
6.3.5 Resilience
There is no specific resilience testing required.
6.3.6 Recoverability (including backup and recovery, including disaster
recovery)
There is no specific recoverability testing required.
6.3.7 Networking
There is no specific network testing required.
6.3.8 Security
There is no specific security testing required.
6.3.9 Supportability
There is no specific supportability testing required.
6.3.10 Manageability (system management)
There is no specific manageability testing required.
6.3.11 Migration
Migration is described in section 2.6. The migration requirements are fairly complex
and particular attention needs paying to testing the various migration scenarios, and in
particular the ability to migrate from the final cash account to the first Branch Trading
period while still providing valid data. The soft launch of the various features will be
tested as part of this test phase.

6.4 ACCEPTANCE
[CDBT] specifies some acceptance criteria and the way in which they will be accepted
against each requirement. The focus of acceptance testing will be on ensuring that all
these acceptance criteria are met other than in those cases where there are agreed
exceptions.
6.1.1 Live Pilot
There are no explicit requirements for a Live Pilot, however there are requirements to
support Soft Launch for some aspects of the functionality (see section 2.6), which will
enable a Live Pilot to be supported.
It should be assumed that a Live Pilot will be required in line with best practice on
other releases.
6.1.2 Capacity Modelling
The changes introduced here will have an impact on the overall system capacity.
Testing will demonstrate that the changes can accommodated within the current
headroom in the system.

The purpose of this chapter is to list all the formal Requirements identified in [CDBT]
and [CDPROG] that are identified as being on Fujitsu Services together with
compliance statements and references to where in this document the meeting of the
requirement is described. Details of acceptance criteria are also included.

I've ignored [CDPROG] since it isn’t yet aligned with [CDBT].

NB it does have some high level requirements which may need to be added in here.

POL have categorised the various requirements with acceptance mechanisms. I’ve
included the mechanism to be used in the following section. Table 36 contains the key.

values as defined in [REPREC]/3.
BT038 Anew check is to be introduced after producing the Trial Yes 2.5.1.4.1 FST

Balance (ie when the “rollover” button is pressed prior to
producing the Final Balance). This check will act as follows:

1. Ifit isn’t the last Stock Unit to rollover, the clerk will
be advised that the Discrepancy is to be posted to a
“local adjustments” account. They have the option
of accepting or rejecting this action

a. Should they accept it, then a pair of
transactions will be generated resulting in
the Discrepancy being reduced to zero and
a corresponding amount being put into a
“local adjustments product”.

b. Should they reject it, then the rollover is
aborted and the clerk is free to do whatever
they wish to balance the Stock Unit and will
then need to balance the Stock Unit again
at a later time.

c. The “local adjustment” is not associated
with any Stock Unit (as with a Suspense
account). Items can be added to it by any
clerk, but only as part of the Balancing
Process. Managers / Supervisors will be
able to move items from it into cash in their
SU to be Made Good.

2. If this is the last Stock Unit to Rollover an additional
check will be performed to ensure that the net total
of transactions, within the Trading Period, in the
“local adjustment” account has a net value of zero.

3. If this is the last Stock Unit to Rollover, then the user
will be informed if the Stock Unit has a Discrepancy
and that this must be resolved before the last Stock
Unit can be rolled over.

Local Adjustment will behave in a similar way to existing
Suspense Account items, namely the values will not be
associated with any Stock Unit, but is considered as part of
the overall Branch balance.

FUJ00090393

Ref.: EA/DPR/004
Version 2.0

Date: 20/12/2004

It is acceptable to prohibit further
processing in a Stock Unit that has
rolled into a new CAP until the
Branch is rolled over into the new
CAP for the two special rollovers,
ie the final CAP to CBDB and the
final CAP prior to switching to
Branch Trading Processes (points
30 and 50 in the migration
process). In both these cases, any
attempt to logon or attach to a
stock unit in the new CAP will
result in all buttons being inhibited
other than those that will support
CAP Rollover; Attachment to a
new SU; and Logout.

Detailed design now shows that this is
not desirable or necessary

The proposal now is that the menu
structure presented to users reflects the
current state of the Stock Unit and
Office in terms of whether they are
operating in CAP or TP mode

¢ — Following the final CAP rollover for
CBDB, changes will be made to
the housekeeping menu to support
changed Suspense accounts;
prevention of Error Notice and
Voucher processing; and
introduction of new Housekeeping
functions to replace vouchers.

This is the current baseline. However
POL are still considering raising a CR to
change this.

Restricting the Housekeeping
menus as specified in requirement
[BT040a] will happen at a specified
date prior to the final CAP for
CBDB being rolled over at all
branches (ie it will not be co-
ordinated to a CAP rollover). In
particular this change will take
place at the same time in all
branches and will not be available
for piloting

* — Transactions Corrections will not
be able to be processed until the
branch is operating in Branch
Trading Mode (ie point 50 in the
migration process). Transactions
Corrections received earlier than
point 50 will be retained and can
be processed after point 50 until
42 days after they were delivered
by POL FS.

« — It must be possible to support a
pilot “POL FS" for selected
branches in parallel with normal
“S60” operation of the live POL
FS. Such a pilot can then be
stopped and a “proper” migration
supported. The term pilot is taken
to mean the provision of data from
selected branches to a test
instance of POL FS whilst
continuing to provide an
operational feed to CBDB. On
completion of the pilot, it is
assumed that the data in the POL
FS test instance will be discarded.

It is understood that a CR will be raised
if a Pilot is to be operated, at which time
operating, infrastructure and test rig
costs will be assessed, i.e. costs for
Pilot operation are not covered by this
CT.

* The flow to POL FS will conform to
the S60 AIS until we first pass
through the S80 Data (i.e. Point 30
in the migration process).
Therefore late data from branches
that are still operating at S60 will
then pass the data through the
$80 interface (but include a
Balancing account)

The details have now been changed
such that Point 25 has been introduced
for the change from the S60 AIS to the
$80 AIS. Also detailed data delivery
has been changed as a result of

CP 3823

«There may be circumstances
under which S80 Transactions
from Horizon get passed to POL
FS prior to the Opening Balances.

[POLFSAIS] now reflects this.

¢ — ForEx will continue to be handled
as a single account within POL FS

It is understood that a CR is likely to be
raised to change this.
PSO_CR00220v2 has formally
documents this change.

« The CD has not identified the
requirement for any special reports
that need to be created to support
branch migration. In particular,
the opening Balance from the first
“new” Stock Unit Balance will not
match the Closing Balance of the
last “old” balance (though business.
processes can be defined to allow
the two to be manually reconciled)

«Pending completion of POL
requirement analysis to define
specific requirements, it has not
been possible to address any
changes that may be necessary to
handle migration non-value stock
products to value stock products.

It is understood that a CR is likely to be
raised to change this.

© The feed to OPTIP will be switched
to MIS at a given point after POL
FS is operational (expected to be
approximately 10 days following
point 30 in the migration process).
It is understood that there is no
requirement for no parallel
running.

This Point is now formally referred to as
Point 40.

« Branch transactions conducted
following completion of the final
CAP and the commencement of
the next trading day (i.e. at the
switch from CBDB to POL FS may
be excluded / double counted in
the summaries prepared for HR.

It is understood that POL procedures
will attempt to mitigate this risk.

Detailed design work will also attempt to
reduce the probability of this happening

The design now ensures that this will not
happen.

«There is no requirement to look at
old NB103's after CBDB switch off

3.2.6

The following assumptions are made about
the interface to HR SAP:

Once the AIS has been baselined, the
impact on the solution design will be
assessed and any changes in the
assumed requirement will be addressed
by CR.

All these assumptions have now been
confirmed in [HRSAPAIS1].

Retained Information
9.1 GENERAL
This chapter has been added to hold text that has been removed from the DP, but is
perhaps relevant to future changes or Lower Level design documentation.
9.2 NON-VALUE STOCK ANALYSIS
This text was previously part of section 2.5.1.1.3.
The remainder of this section is an analysis of the sort of things that could be done,
however at present it is assumed that none of this will be done for Impact R3.

Table 43 - Categories of Non-Value Stock
[Ms tem has 4702 Pre Pack Currency instead of N Lott Chgs.
Table 43 identifies the various types of non-value stock in the current system. The
following subsections consider each one in turn.
9.2.1 Travel Schemes and Local Authority Vouchers

These can be converted into controlled stock fairly simply. They are currently defined
as a single product which is used both for the non-value stock declaration and for the
transaction of the item within the Serve Customer menu. The following is required for
these products.

Note that these changes should not be done on Live until after the cash account has
been removed (ie after point E in the migration strategy). This will mean that there is
no need to worry about the impact on cash account mappings.

= New buttons are added to the Rem In / Out from ADC and Transfer Out menus to
support Remitting these products in / out and transferring them between Stock
Units. These buttons should use the same pick lists as are currently used on the
Serve Customer menus for these products.

Version 2.0

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/12/2004

= RDS generates a new version of the Reference Data such that the product is
defined as a Stock Item with any necessary changes to the product mappings so
that it is reported correctly.

Since changing mappings on an existing product is likely to cause unpredictable
effects, it will be necessary to introduce new, equivalent products with the new
mappings and withdraw the old ones. Since these products appear on picklists,
then this should not cause any problems other than to any PLU lists.

The product will also need to be included in the Stock Adjustment and Stock
Declarations lists.

= Following the change of Reference Data, the next time the Stock Unit is balanced,
then the user will find that the system generated Stock Position will not match
reality. This should be rectified by making a Stock Adjustment (or in a shared
Stock unit it could be done by making a Stock Declaration on each drawer and
accepting any discrepancy that results). This will result in the systems generated
position being brought in line with the amount present.

Note that to avoid this resulting in a corresponding cash discrepancy it will be
necessary to ensure that all such products have a zero “loss price” (at least until
this adjustment has been carried out).

Need to check if these adjustments will cause any problems for POL FS. I would assume that
they won't since there will have been no “opening figures” for these products.

= Ifrequired it should then be OK to change the “loss price” to a non-zero value.

9.2.2 MVL Disks

MVL Disks are currently sold by the AP application and detailed investigations are
required to decide what can be done.

Here there are currently different stock products for each expiry date. Changing the
DVLA application to take this into account is considered to be outside the scope of
Impact, so it is assumed that it is sufficient to mange the stock of MVLs at the generic
level. Currently there is no link between DVLA Transactions and an explicit month’s
tax disk.

Te it is sufficient to know that a branch has 70 tax discs and not know that there are 10 for each
month from September 2004 to March 2005.

9.2.3 Other Tokens

It isn’t currently clear what these products are used for. They seem to be all
Electricity tokens of some sort, but it isn’t clear how they are used. They are assumed
to be related to AP Transactions. Detailed investigations are required to decide what
can be done.

9.2.4 NRA Rods
Looking at these products there appear to be separate service products for a single
stock product (eg a Salmon licence can be sold as a number of different products
depending who it is sold to and for what period of time). There is little that can be
done here without Product re-engineering.
9.2.5 N. Lott. Chqs
This has been discussed as a potential product for re-engineering and it is proposed
that it is left uncontrolled until such re-engineering takes place.
