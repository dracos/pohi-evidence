Dear Sirs, —
Re: Khayyam Ishaq
Trial at Bradford Crown Court 25" February 2013
We write further to your letter dated the 20" November 2012 and thank you for enclosures
in respect of the same.
With regard to the other matters of disclosure contained within our defence case
statement, we make reference to an Order made by HHJ Rose at the Plea and Case
Management Hearing. We are not aware of any such Order that a revised Defence Case
Statement should be served with a view to disclosure being reviewed on your part.
Our Defence Case Statement not only details our defence and the issues we take with the
Horizon Software but also we feel it explains why we make the disclosure requests.
In the interest of progressing, the matter we ask that you review your disclosure obligations
if you have not already done so and revert back to us with your final position and if you still
feel that you are not obliged or willing to provide the information then we may give thought
to a Section 8 application.
We look forward to hearing from you as a matter of extreme urgency.
Yours fajtbfullv....... a
