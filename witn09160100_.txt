                FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF GARY THOMAS




I, Gary Thomas, will say as follows....




This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
"Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 23rd August 2023
(the "Request"). I am responding below to all the questions set out in the annex
supplied to me on the date of the request on the 23 August.




INTRODUCTION


1 _ I am a former employee of Post Office Ltd and held the various positions of
   Counter Clerk, Assistant Manager, Branch Manager, Security Manager and
   Fraud Investigator and Field Change Advisor amongst other short-term roles
   between September 1985 and September 2017, when I then left the business
   after 32 years loyal service. My qualifications and training were all undertaken
   through internal training initially as a Counter Clerk following on to Branch
                                                                                      WITN09160100
                                                                                     WITNO9160100




   Manager Courses and included my Security and PACE training when I joined
   the Security Team from around 2000 as I recall_




BACKGROUND


2_ 1 became a Fraud Investigator / Security Manager around 2000 as I recall
   following an internal application and a recommendation from my Line Manager
   at the time, Mr Andrew Thomson. At that time, I was the Post Office Branch
   Manager in Southampton Crown Post Office and after I had lost both my
   parents in the space of 9 months, there was a vacancy in Security being
   advertised. Andrew Thomson felt I had the necessary experience and expertise
   to do well within this type of role and it was based in Bournemouth closer to my
   home. I therefore applied and underwent a fairly complex set of Interviews
   before being offered the role of Post Office Security Manager. This
   subsequently resulted in a residential training course lasting around 3 weeks as
   I recall and to be trained in various competencies including PACE 1984 Codes
   of Practice, Interviewing Under Caution, Voluntary Searching of Home, Person
   and Vehicles along with completion of notebook entries and the retention and
   storing of exhibits to name but a few I can now try to remember, some 23 plus
   years ago.


3_ My initial Line Manager was Mr Geoff Hall, the Security Area Team Leader_ I
   subsequently had a number of other Team Managers as I recall over the years
   I was in the team, including Tony Utting, Andy Hayward, Dave Posnett and
   Jason Collins. All of these Area Managers reported to the various National
   Heads Of Security with the first I recall being Mr Tony Marsh whom I had little
   direct contact with but felt he was however very competent and respected.
   There was also Mr Phil Gerrish who again was excellent and very
   approachable and then my final Head of Security before I left was Mr John
   Scott.


4. During my time in the Security I Fraud Team, I found all of my colleagues and
   Direct Line Managers (Area Team Leaders) to be both competent, professional
                                                                                        WITNO9160100
                                                                                       WITN09160100




   and approachable. I did not necessarily feel the same or hold the respect of all
   of the Security Senior Managers in my final last few years within the team and
   before I left_ The reason I say this is the firsthand experience I witnessed with
   the treatment of Security Team colleagues and managers in the last few years I
   worked there. They appeared to not welcome any challenges or questions
   raised from team members with regards to any decisions or changes they
   made or planned to introduce. I can't give specific examples of these now but
   recall personally how they would introduce unreasonable working practices and
   work locations for team members. For example, I lived in Bournemouth and
   worked from either home or an office base for probably around 9/10 years as
   did my colleagues Graham Brander in Southampton and Mike Wilcox in
   Plymouth. I also around 2009 possibly shared an office with Lester Chine now
   living in Bournemouth. We were all told we then all had to work out of Swindon
   Stock Centre as a Hub at least 3 days a week when there appeared no valid or
   sensible reason. This was to be at our own time travelling and at our own
   expense for fuel. Mike Wilcox in Plymouth who was in the Security Team for
   well over 12 years at the time could clearly not do the 300 mile a day round trip
   in his own time after say an 8 or 9 hour day and at his own expense. He
   subsequently felt he had no option other than to leave the business after nearly
   40 years service, when to everyone else it was a kind of constructive dismissal
   situation. This is just one example of several as to why I say this now.




5. The Security Manager / Fraud Investigator roles were as above and generally
   covering both positions which were the same in many aspects but just held a
   different title, is my only considered difference. Although the Security Manager
   Role was later more related to external crime, with attacks on staff for example
   delivering cash and stock or where a burglary or robbery had taken place at an
   office.




6. With regards to disciplinary matters these were always dealt with by the Post
   Office Contracts Manager towards Subpostmasters and with regards to
   Counter Clerks / Branch Managers, this was dealt with by the Post Office
                                                                                       WITNO9160100
                                                                                     WITNO9160100




   Counters Area Managers. I can confirm that on occasions I was asked to
   advise Postmasters that they may have been precautionary suspended on
   behalf of their Contracts Manager pending further information and subject to a
   meeting or interview with that said person.


7. My role was to interview individuals who were Post Office employees, either
   direct Crown Office Staff or via their Subpostmaster Contract, who were
   suspected or who had admitted to committing a criminal offence or to ascertain
   the facts surrounding an enquiry. Individuals were either interviewed voluntarily
   where I would advise them of their legal rights and the Post Office Friend rule
   for any interview, or unless they were arrested by the Police, the Police would
   do all this before transporting them to the local Police Station for the
   subsequent Interview. I would have still conducted the Interview at a Police
   Station as we were a well-known recognised interviewing authority with the
   Police similar to that of the Benefits Agency / DWP Security Teams.




8. I would always give disclosure to any Legal Representative who was present in
   either suspected criminal or voluntary interviews. Should any case proceed to
   court, the Post Office Legal Services Team or any Legal Representative
   instructed by the Post Office would deal with any disclosure.


9. This is the same with any litigation case strategy. This would have been the
   Post Office Legal Team's role as I can recall.




10. My liaising with other Post Office departments would have been varied
   depending on who was interviewed. This would include my Line Manager,
   Security Casework Managers, Post Office Contracts / Area Managers,
   Postmaster Federation Reps, Financial Recovery Investigators in later years
   when the Proceeds of Crime Act was introduced. There was also the Post
   Office Helpline, Auditor's and there may have been several others, but these
   were the frequent ones I still recall.

 12. In respect of all the numerous documents I have accessed, I can say a few look
     familiar, a few were more Royal Mail specific and some documents I have
     never seen or recall as I had already possibly left the Security Team when they
     were produced and / or circulated.


 13. The Security / Fraud Team structure as I remember was made up of The Head
     of Security - Tony Marsh 2000, Phil Gerrish, Tony Utting (temporary) Dave
     Pardoe (temporary) and John Scott. The other Senior Security Managers had
     specific titles like Policy and Standards Manager, Head of Financial
     Investigations, Senior Casework and Compliance Manager and Fraud Risk
     Manager. I have no recollection of all their specific titles, but other senior
     managers I recall included John Bigley and Dave Pardoe who I think we're
     maybe Senior Fraud Strand Leaders to name but two on my departure. Below
     the Senior Managers were the Fraud Regional Area Team Manager Roles,
     which when I joined included maybe around 7 regions or more, but by my
     departure from the team there were just two with Northern England and
     Southern England (North I South) teams. The significant changes over my time
                                                                                            WITNO9160100
                                                                                       WITN09160100




   in the team was the move from around 40-50 plus Security / Fraud Managers
   working to about 7-8 Area Managers and this was eventually cut to about 16
   Security / Fraud Managers working to two just Area Managers. In addition to
   these were Financial Investigators. As I remember, there were maybe 3
   Financial Investigator positions including a Team Leader. There was also The
   Casework / Compliance Manager and their support team members. There was
   also towards the end of my time, a Fujitsu Liaison Officer - Mark Dinsdale and
   then Jane Owen, who you could request any Horizon ARQ Data to be
   downloaded via Fujitsu to sometimes assist with a case. There were other
   support type staff based in Croydon on my joining in 2000 and who were later
   based in Salford when I left the team. I am sure there were many other roles I
   could possibly confirm, but at this time cannot recall specifically the job or titles.


14.1 played no role in the development or content of the above policies at point 11
   but would have been possibly advised by the ones that directly involved my role
   and that were to be followed at the time whilst I was in the Team.




15. Any legislation, policies or guidance governing the conduct of investigations, or
   any relevant changes, would have been communicated if relevant in the
   policies like shown at point 11, but I personally had no authority or involvement
   in their content or any changes as far as I can remember.


16. 1 had no involvement in investigation policies pre or post POL separation.




17.1 have no recollection of any specific complaints about the conduct of an
   investigation by myself in the Security team, but my Line Manager would have
   been my first contact point should there have been any made against me or my
   colleagues. And I can only assume this would have been the same depending
   on whatever level the complaint was directed at. Again, complaints could have
   been made at the Contract Manager's disciplinary interview or via the Security
   Team / Helpline etc or even at court I guess and again I am sure this would
   have been escalated and been brought to the specific individual's attention by
   their line manager through some disciplinary aspect.
                                                                                            WITN09160100
                                                                                        WITNO9160100




18. The supervision of criminal investigation conducted by Security Managers was
   carried out by both the Area Team Manager (Line Manager) and the Casework
   Manager / Compliance Manager through various means including being at
   some interviews, as well as daily phone calls, our monthly 1-1 meetings, and
   monthly Team Meetings for every case to be updated upon. The Casework
   Manager followed a case paper compliance check to ensure every case was
   subjected to the same levels of standards, care and procedural check for
   consistency in work quality.




19. In respect of the Post Office policy and practice regarding investigations and
   prosecution of Crown Office employees, this was the same as for
   Subpostmasters as far as I was concerned. The only thing that changed in my
   opinion was the actual number of audits carried out at the Crown Offices
   seemed to reduce over the years, as the staffing numbers reduced within
   audits as it had also done within the Security Team. These were all subjected
   to cutbacks for Post Office Ltd, overhead and bottom-line costs. The Post
   Office's focus on Crown Office losses for Branch Manager's was another factor
   that meant the Security Team had to prioritise their enquiries around the offices
   with the consistently worst or highest losses to the business including the worst
   Crown Office's.


Audit and Investigation


20. I have considered the document "Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance"
   (version 2, October 2008) (POL00104821). An investigator would sometimes
   attend an audit if they had been allocated a case and had actually instigated or
   requested the audit was carried out if there was a possible suspect offender.
   This could either be the Postmaster or potentially a member of their staff.
   Occasionally, a routine audit may have been conducted as possibly a request
   to return any identified excess cash held on hand at a branch that had not been
   forthcoming or returned, suspecting maybe the cash was not on hand for them
   to do this. If on the audit a substantial shortfall was identified by the auditors, or
   an admission made to them, then an investigator may have been contacted
                                                                                        WITNO9160100
                                                                                     WITN09160100




   about their availability to attend depending on the location, time and
   circumstances. The investigators' role on attendance was always to await any
   final outcome result of the audit that was also communicated at that point to the
   Contracts Manager. The auditor would ask if there was any explanation for any
   discrepancy discovered and compare the physical cash on hand to the
   declared cash made the previous night at the Post Office branch, as well as
   check all the stock. If any admission was made to the auditor either upon arrival
   or during the audit, they would write this down and ask the person admitting
   this to sign that this was a true reflection of what they had said. Any
   investigators in attendance after this would then show their identity and
   introduce themselves and explain the reason for their attendance. Depending
   on the specific situation their line manager (Area Team Manager) would be
   advised, the next steps would then be decided. There could have been a
   reasonable explanation, or the case could have resulted in a caution and then
   they would be advised of their Legal Rights / Post Office Friend Rule etc. It
   could be a request for voluntary searches or not, again depending on the
   circumstances before a possible interview. However, every case would not
   necessarily be the same circumstances, so this is not a definitive answer.


21. Security / Fraud Investigators line managers or further up the Security Seniority
   chain, determined whether an investigation into potential criminality was
   conducted by the Security Team, or if the case was to be taken forwards as a
   debt recovery matter by the Financial Investigators or the relevant legal team.
   Any debt identified would be reported and the recovery of Post Office funds
   missing was always considered a business priority. If the Financial Recoveries
   Manager or above felt that voluntary repayment was not apparent or likely, I
   would assume they would then decide if they were to pursue the financial
   recovery processes. Financial recoveries through court orders etc only became
   apparent following the introduction of the Proceeds of Crime Act and the
   introduction and training of the specialist Post Office Financial Recovery
   Managers.


22_Where the branch was run by a SPM, the SPM's local contract manager did
   have input into this in some ways as they would be immediately informed, but
   they dealt entirely with their Contractual Employment decision. If they re-
                                                                                           WITNO9160100
                                                                                         WITNO9160100




   instated a Postmaster following their fact-finding interview, or if they had a
   reasonable explanation or reason for the shortfall including reimbursing, as per
   their contractual obligation, then no financial investigation would take place.


23. 1 have no idea of any specific criteria or triggers, or if these changed whilst I
   was in the team, for raising a fraud case following the identification of a shortfall
   or discrepancy in a branch. I am not sure if the triggers or criteria for raising a
   theft or false accounting case are different and if so, what they were.
   Documents I have been referred to have possible indications of say £5,000 and
   later £15,000 as triggers but, this may have been in respect of financial
   recovery triggers more than raising an actual case, so I am not entirely sure
   and unable to answer this.


The process followed by Security team investigators when conducting a
criminal investigation following the identification of a shortfall at an audit


24. Once a decision was made to conduct a suspected criminal investigation, the
   next steps process depended upon each case and if the investigator was
   present at the audit or not. If I was present once the decision was made, I
   would explain my position and show my identification and explain their legal
   rights and Post Office Friend rule. If I was not present, then my contact would
   often be either by telephone or by a letter if this wasn't possible but again
   explaining the same Legal Rights and Post Office Friend rule. Case papers
   would be raised, and the necessary stakeholders advised that a case was
   apparent. Subsequently, evidence would be gathered usually at the audit and
   possible searches conducted. Then a PACE taped Interview would be
   conducted and then summarised unless full transcripts were later requested. A
   full Suspect Offender report along with a separate discipline report that was
   sent to the Contracts Manager would be produced and copied to the line
   manager for checking before submission to the Casework Manager for Legal
   recommendation and the usual compliance checks.


Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings
                                                                                        WITN09160100
                                                                                       WITNO9160100




25. Following an initial investigation, the case papers would be forwarded to the
   Post Office Legal Team via the Casework Manager for any recommendation or
   possible charges and then the decision of whether prosecution was considered
   appropriate would be advised. Any decision agreed would be filtered back to
   the investigator via the Casework Manager and their Line Manager, with advice
   on any necessary statements or evidence considered to proceed. I am unsure
   if they themselves obtained or needed authority from their Senior Security
   Manager also.


26. During my time within the Security Team, the Contracts Manager only dealt
   with the Subpostmasters employment contract and had no input into any
   prosecution decision making.


27.1 have no idea of any test applied by those making prosecution or charging
   decisions. I always believed the decision was only made if there was sufficient
   evidence to suggest beyond reasonable doubt that a criminal offence had been
   committed by the individual.


28.A written advice with suggested charges was added to the Casework file with
   any recommendation from the Post Office Legal Team and then an authority to
   proceed or otherwise was made from the Casework / Team Manager possibly
   on the Senior Manager's authority.




29. In respect of this any restraint decision on assets identified, this was made by
   the trained Financial Investigator, and this was decided on if a benefit from
   crime was clear I would suggest. This only happened when the Proceeds of
   Crime Act was introduced as I recall.


30. 1 am unable to answer as to who decided whether criminal enforcement
   proceedings should be pursued and what factors did they consider when
   making decisions around this, other than I would again assume the Financial
   Investigation Team possibly on authority of The Head Of Security.


Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security team
                                                                                          WITNO9160100
                                                                                         WITN09160100




31 _I have been asked what instructions, guidance and / or training were given to
        investigators within the Security team about the following topics and how was
    this provided:
   i.      interviewing a SPM / SPM's assistant / Crown Office employee who was
           suspected of a criminal offence;
  ii.      taking witness statements in the course of an investigation;
 iii.      conducting searches in the course of an investigation;
 iv.       the duty on an investigator to investigate a case fully;
  v.       obtaining evidence in the course of an investigation;
 vi.       whether and in what circumstances evidence should be sought from third
           parties who might hold relevant evidence and, in particular, Fujitsu, where
           shortfalls were identified in branch;
vii.       an investigator's disclosure obligations;
viii.      drafting investigation reports to enable a decision to be made about the
           future conduct of a case.


32. With respect to all points listed above, I was given initial training on my
    appointment as I recall over around 3 weeks at a residential training location
    covering all these aspects. We were supplied with reference books and files for
    covering all these subjects and were tested to ensure we passed the necessary
        level of competence to conduct Pace 1984 Codes of Practice Interviewing
    techniques along with all these other areas. My recollection of point vi) above
    as to whether and in what circumstances evidence should be sought from third
    parties who might hold relevant evidence and, in particular, Fujitsu, where
    shortfalls were identified in branch was often through discussions with the
    Legal Team / Casework Manager & Line Manager (Team Leader), was that any
        request for Fujitsu data was only when this became available to us and
        dependent on the type of investigation being undertaken, if considered
    appropriate and thought able to assist that particular enquiry. Requests were
    not necessarily requested in every case, as not always deemed necessary if
    admissions were made and clearly there was also no reason for me or
    colleagues to doubt the Horizon System had these confirmed bugs, errors or
        defects as it has been stated now during this inquiry.
                                                                                           WITNO9160100
                                                                                      WITNO9160100




33. 1 have reviewed the Casework Management document at [POL00104747]
   (version 1.0, March 2000) and [POL00104777] (version 4.0, October 2002);
   David Posnett's email to me and others dated 23 May 2011 at [POL00118096]
   and the documents [POL00118108], [POL00118109], [POL00118101],
   [P0L00118102], [P0L00118103], [P0L00118104], [P0L00118105],
   [P0L00118106] and [P0L00118107];


34.1 would have no reason to doubt that I would have been provided with both the
   2000 or 2002 version of the Casework Management document when I held
   relevant roles within the Security Team.


35. My understanding by the instructions / guidance given in second, third and
   fourth bullet points on page 2 of the 2000 version and the first, second and third
   bullet points on page 2 of the 2002 version (in particular whether I understood
   this to be relevant to Post Office' disclosure obligations in relation to information
   about Horizon bugs, errors and defects); was that upon my submission of the
   case papers the Casework Manager / Legal Team would check the content of
   the discipline report to ensure it had just the discipline aspect covered. With
   regards to Horizon bugs, errors or defects I was totally unaware that any such
   things existed as I am confident were all of my colleagues at the time, so there
   would have been no occasion I would have disclosed this as I had absolutely
   no idea whatsoever it was relevant. In fact, I am now so angry and livid to have
   been made aware of these facts more recently and since leaving the Post
   Office back in 2017.



36_ My recollection of compliance checks and their purpose was to ensure a high
   consistency of standards across all casework paper submissions by all team
   members and to give a consistent approach in all files. These checks were
   carried out by the Casework Manager against a tick list 100% score as seen at
   page 1 of document (POL00118108).


37. The documents were in my opinion a kind of training aid to assist me and my
   colleagues in a consistent approach in raising standards and in checking I had
   covered the 100-point score areas prior to submitting my case papers.
                                                                                         WITN09160100
                                                                                        WITNO9160100




38. The suite of compliance documents at the time was to ensure consistency and
   raise quality standards and were monitored and used as part of our line
   managers appraisal process.


39. 1 did not have any role in the development, management or amendment other
   than to use this if required as an aid for casework submission.



40_My understanding under paragraph 2.15 on page 10 of the document entitled
   "Guide to the Preparation and Layout of Investigation Red Label Case Files —
   Offender reports & Discipline reports" ([POL00118101], attached to David
   Posnett's email of 23 May 2011) and how this related to the Offender Report
   template (at [POL00118102], attached to David Posnett's email of 23 May
   2011, was to advise of any identified failures in security as shown as the
   second from last point on document (POL00118102) after copy reports and
   tape summary. This could include, but is not exhaustive to, shared or known
   Horizon Logan codes and passwords, the sharing of date stamps, keys left in
   safes, parcel hatch left open, security doors propped open, high levels of cash
   held in counter tills or excess cash held at the office etc. Basically, any known
   or identified breaches or failures in security. Clearly any Horizon bugs, errors or
   defects were not known.


41. During my time within the Security Team, I was not aware of any known or
   suspected Horizon Bugs, errors or defects and as stated previously and I am
   very angry to have been now made aware this was known.



42.1 can state I had absolutely no involvement in the drafting of the document
   entitled "Identification Codes" at [POL00118104] attached to Dave Posnetts
   email dated 23 May 2011. Sorry I have absolutely no idea as to who did.


43_ I don't recall the document entitled "Identification Codes" or even viewing it or
   some of the other documents attached in the email if I'm honest. The
   documents attached in the email were suggested to mainly assist the new
   people we recruited into the team recently in 2011. I was at this time of around
                                                                                       WITNO9160100
                                                                                      WITN09160100




   11 years' experience and had always followed the Police Identification codes
   contained within PACE. I therefore knew that mostly I had dealt with an IC1
   suspect but would refer to PACE if unsure.


44. It was my understanding that we all actually usually asked the individuals to
   describe themselves and assign their own belief on identification codes. The
   codes were mainly only used in cases we submitted upon any successful
   prosecution on to an NPA001/002 document. This was standing for Non-Police
   Agency as any criminal offence proved and charged this would need to be
   added to the PNC (Police National Computer Database) to ensure any known
   offence was correctly recorded on the said individual.


Analysing Horizon data, requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu and relationship
with Fujitsu


45. When I held relevant roles within the Security team, I have no specific
   examples of analysis being done by Security team investigators of Horizon data
   when a SPM / SPM's manager(s) or assistant(s) / Crown Office employee(s)
   attributed a shortfall to a problem with Horizon. But if there were any
   employees that suggested this was the case, I would have asked them initially
   what steps they had taken to report this fact. What examples they had actually
   discovered on Horizon to claim this and had they reported this at their earliest
   opportunity to say the Post Office Helpdesk, their Contracts Manager or the
   possibility of requesting some further training assistance or even an audit for
   example. If I had any ARQ Horizon Data available to me either before any
   interview or requested this subsequently after I would have spent time viewing
   and assessing any such claim they made by looking for any potential issue. If
   had found any evidence this would have been communicated and obviously
   disclosed but I never did. I was also unaware that any Horizon System issues
   could be attributed to a shortfall other than human error / mistakes or
   wrongdoing and had there been such issues assume they would have been
   more apparent across the many thousands if not all Post Offices Horizon
   locations_


46.1 have no idea of the Contractual requirements on Fujitsu other than it was my
                                                                                           WITN09160100
                                                                                       WITNO9160100




   understanding that there was an agreed number with regards to requests per
   year for ARQ Data and it was not an infinitive number of requests that could be
   made.



47.As above, along with all my colleagues, I understand we knew there was a limit
   but I have no idea what that was or any cost amounts incurred for any requests
   made over and above that agreed limit.


48. 1 have no idea as to any changes to the contractual requirements on Fujitsu, as
   I understood them to be (including in respect of the ability of POL to obtain
   audit data, the type of data and the quality and completeness of the data), nor
   to any limits on the number of ARQ requests which would be covered without
   additional charges and how requests above the limits were dealt with / charged.



49. Nor do I have any idea of any changes as between Legacy Horizon and
   Horizon Online and maybe I had already left the team when this happened.


50. My role would be to request any data covering specific time scales for the
   periods of suspect offending on the case enquiry I had been allocated and
   dealing with. I can't recall if this was either via email or possibly completion of a
   kind of ARQ request form sent to Mark Dinsda►e or Jane Owen in Salford.



51. Either my line manager, the casework manager or the ARQ requesting Fujitsu
   Liaison Manager decided whether to authorise an ARQ request.


52. It is my recollection that ARQ requests would be made to or received via either
   Penny Thomas or Andy Dunks at Fujitsu via Mark Dinsdale / Jane Owen.



53. Data was presented by Fujitsu in the form of a CD Rom or sometimes
   numerous CD Rom's depending on the actual time frames and amounts of data
   requested. Should the Horizon Data be used in evidence, then a Witness
                                                                                         WITNO9160100
                                                                                    WITNO9160100




   Statement or Statements would be obtained from the person producing and
   supplying the data. This as I recall was a kind of standard statement on each
   occasion other than the Office details and the ARQ no's produced being
   changed. The expert Witness Statement if proceeding to Court was as I was
   reminded of in the documents by a Gareth Jenkins at Fujitsu.


54. 1 have no recollection of ever seeing any of these documents listed here:
         i.   The document entitled "Conducting Audit Data Extractions at CSR"
              dated 4 May 2000 at [POL00029169];
        ii.   The document entitled "Conducting Audit Data Extractions at Live"
              dated 27 November 2001 at [FUJ00152176];
       iii.   The versions of the document entitled "Management of the Litigation
              Support Service" dated 27 October 2009 ([FUJ00152212]), 14
              February 2012 ([FUJ00152220]) and 23 April 2012 ([FUJ00152225]),
              as well as the version marked "withdrawn" at [FUJ00152235];
        iv.   The versions of the document entitled "Audit Data Extraction Process"
              dated 13 September 2010 ([FUJ00152216]), 1 March 2011
              ([FUJ00152218]), 14 February 2012 ([FUJ00152221]), 3 September
              2014 ([FUJ00152226]) and 4 September 2014 ([FUJ00152228]);
        v.    The document entitled "Security Management Service: Service
              Description"   (SVM/SDM/SD/0017)        dated    24    August       2006
              ([FUJ00002033]), 31 December 2008 ([FUJ00080107]), 15 October
              2010 ([FUJ00002264]), 25 November 2013 ([FUJ00088868]), 4
              December 2013 ([FUJ00002555]), 4 April 2014([POL00002572])and
              19 February 2016 ([POL00002666])(in all versions see, in particular,
              paragraph 2.4).


55. 1 never recall any of my cases suggesting where a shortfall had been identified
   and the relevant SPM / SPM's manager(s) or assistant(s)! Crown Office
   employee(s) attributed the shortfall to problems with Horizon, that ARQ data
   requested from Fujitsu was requested as a matter of course. This was the
   case at Astwood Bank as far as I recall. It was my belief and that of my
   colleagues I would guess that shortfalls could not actually be attributed to
   Horizon as there was no knowledge or evidence to suggest there was anything
   wrong with the system. We even had and used expert witnesses with
                                                                                      WITN09160100
                                                                                     WITNO9160100




   statements from Fujitsu to corroborate this.


56. Where ARQ data was obtained from Fujitsu, in circumstances where a shortfall
   had been identified and the relevant SPM was attributing the shortfall to
   problems with Horizon, as there was no known bugs, errors or defects known
   and certainly no evidence from Fujitsu to suggest there was anything wrong
   with the system then I would assume the data would be unlikely or not have
   been provided.



57. As you can see at (FUJ00156221) the email trail the Security Managers / Fraud
   Investigators had no official direct contact with Fujitsu as this was done via
   Mark Dinsdale as our Fujitsu contact that was later to be Jane Owen. As I
   recall, the two main people I would have received ARQ Data from was via
   either a Penny Thomas or Andy Dunks. They would produce a witness
   statement along the lines of these extracts being requested and supplied but
   their so-called expert witness statement for court came from a Gareth Jenkins
   at Fujitsu.


58. 1 have considered [FUJ00122938] and [FUJ00122939]. The processes in
   place for investigators contacting Fujitsu engineers, was:
       (a) Investigators would make any Fujitsu requests for ARQ Horizon Data or
       (b) statements needed through the Post Office point of contact at the time I
           recall being Mark Dinsdale then Jane Owen.
      (b) I have no real idea why it was "against the process for investigators to
      approach Fujitsu engineers directly" other than them being contacted by
      numerous team members rather than say one point of contact within the
      Post Office Security Team to request all.
      (c) Jane Owen was the Post Office / Fujitsu point of contact to make
      requests for ARQ Data and I think she replaced Mark Dinsdale who
      previously did this.
      (d) I have no idea, in what circumstances would the usual process not be
      followed unless in periods of say annual leave or sickness when a substitute
      person may cover their role I guess.
      (e) I would very rarely have direct contact with engineers/technicians from
                                                                                        WITNO9160100
                                                                                      WITNO9160100




      Fujitsu, although I did have some contact probably via email. I am sure
      regarding receipt of ARQ data or possibly requests for witness statements.
      This may have happened say 2/3 times a year at a guess with Penny
      Thomas or Andy Dunks and maybe once maybe twice in my whole time in
      the team with regards to Gareth Jenkins if he was the expert witness at
      court.


59.1 understood Gareth Jenkins was the Fujitsu expert witness to supply a
   statement and give evidence in court about the accuracy, robustness and
   reliability of the Horizon Data and Horizon System.


60. I cannot comment further as to what extent did I consider him to be acting as an
   expert witness, just on the advice of the Post Office Senior Security Team and
   Legal Team and I can't answer any further.


Relationship with others


61. My main involvement was with the Post Office Legal Services Team more so
   than with Cartwright King Solicitors whom I think took over just prior to me
   leaving the team. They would, I guess, be forwarded our casework for sight and
   advise on possible charges and statements required in much the same way as
   had been the case with the Post Office Legal Team previously. I have no
   recollection of any specific names at Cartwright King and my only interaction
   with them would have been by email or possibly telephone.


62. My only involvement or interaction with the National Federation of
   Subpostmasters would be if the local representative acted at interview as a
   Post Office Friend. The only person I recall, as I met with him on a good few
   occasions, was Mr Mark Baker. If I needed to, I would sometimes contact Mark
   if a Postmaster did not know their local representative to see if he had a point
   of contact to help me and the Postmaster and I felt I got along with Mark Baker
   very well.

Prosecution of Mr Julian Wilson — Astwood Bank Post Office


63. I have reviewed the following documents:
       i)      The stakeholder notification [POL00047065]
       ii)     The event capture form [POL00118275]
       iii)    The financial investigation case closure report [POL00119127]
       iv)     The financial investigation events log [POL00044749]

       vi)     The investigation report [POL00044803]
       vii)    The suspect offender report [POL00119221]
       viii)   The case timeline [POL00114696]
       ix)     The case closure report [POL00114739]




Initial investigation


In answering the questions below, I have reviewed the following documents:


       i)      The draft audit report [POL00050062]
       ii)     The Record of Tape Recorded Interview dated 15 September 2008
       at [POL00050140] (part 1) and [POL00050128] (part 2);


64.1 remember the office name of Astwood Bank, the Postmaster's name of Julian
   Wilson and that voluntary searches of the home and car were carried out prior
   to the interview with Mr Wilson at his Solicitors Office on the 15th September
   2008. 1 can now recall from the document (POL00044803) that his solicitor was
   not a specialist in the criminal law field and I asked if he was sure he did not
   want to seek this kind of Legal Advice and if he was still happy to proceed with
   his interview at Astwood Law. Mr Wilson confirmed he was aware of this but
   wanted to still proceed. Other than this I have assisted my recollection now with
   the available documents, reports and tape summaries etc at Points 37 & 38
   including [POL00044803] previously mentioned and [POL00050140 and
   POL00050128]. I have to say whilst being assisted by the Investigation Report
   document [POL00044803] I have found within my own report a typo error with
   regards to the date of the interview. It actually took place on Monday 15th
                                                                                                           WITN09160100
                                                                                                          WITNO9160100




   September 2008 at Astwood Law but I had stated the 11th September 2008 in
   my report which was the day the audit took place not the interview. My
   apologies for the error and hopefully this was identified at the time the papers
   were submitted or accepted as an error. I have also seen that it appears the
   report [POL00044803] was dated the 2 December 2008. This appears to be
   somewhat outside the submission case papers time scales and compliance
   time and I cannot be certain, but I am thinking maybe I was absent from work
   following the interview. This may have been sickness I'm thinking or even a
   holiday and then sickness, but I cannot be sure. I am not sure if my own
   personnel HR papers would clarify this if still available and I have now tried to
   obtain these by emailing the Post Office and asking the Solicitor if they may still
   be available of course. I will also see if my GP has any NHS records as I know I
   was off at one time _.__._._._._._._._._._._._.cRo._._._~__._._.____._.. The reason I am considering
   this a possibility is the date on the report, and also as the taped summaries I
   viewed at [POL00050140] and [POL00050128] as I feel they could have been
   prepared by someone other than myself. They clearly appear accurate and a
   true account of the interview, but the layout and font used etc does not look
   necessarily like the way I would have summarised my own tapes at that time.
   We did at times as I recall use a company who would offer the tape summary
   support facility with the tapes, but I can't be specific when and whom. Again, if
   in absence they may also have been done again by my second officer or even
   my line manager if my workload was excessive at the time ,but I can't be sure
   some 15 plus years ago now.


65.1 first became involved in Mr Wilson's case following his admission to the
   Auditors on the day of the 11 September 2008 that they would find a large
   shortage and cash missing that he had been falsely accounting for over a
   period of around 5 years. They subsequently confirmed the shortage on the
   day and obtained a signed declaration from Mr Wilson that this was the case.
   This can also be confirmed in the document [POL00050062].



66. I was the lead Fraud Investigator! Security Manager allocated to this case.


67. On the arrival of the Auditors Mr Wilson advised them that they would find a
                                                                                      WITN09160100
                                                                                     WITNO9160100




   shortage of over £27,000 that had occurred over a period of about 5 years. The
   audit result confirmed this, and Mr Wilson was precautionarily suspended on
   the authority of his Contracts Manager Glen Chester.



68.1 would have had no invo►vement in this decision although it may have been the
   auditors who advised Mr Wilson of the decision by his Contracts Manager
   Glenn Chester unless he had spoken to Mr Wilson on the phone.


69. This would have been my line manager at the time following the notification of
   the shortfall found by the auditors or via the Contracts Manager by the creation
   of a case file allocated to myself.



70. I would have spoken to Mr Wilson on the phone advising him of his Legal
   Rights and that of the Post Office Friend rule. I would have explained that I
   would like to conduct a Voluntary Interview with him and would he also consent
   to any voluntary search of his home and maybe a vehicle. Mr Wilson agreed to
   the searches and said he was going to take Legal Advice and gave me the
   contact details of his Solicitor at Astwood Law and that he would have his
   Postmaster Federation Rep present acting as his Post Office Friend.


71. The evidence that was shown to Mr Wilson at the interview would have been
   listed within my suspect offender report the document [POL00044803]
   (previously mentioned) and would have included the completion of the GS001
   and GS003 forms advising Mr Wilson of his Legal Rights and Post Office
   Friend option. I would also have shown Mr Wilson and confirmed it was him
   that signed the statement of what he had informed the auditors on their arrival.
   A►so, the Event Log Balancing printout and a selection of Branch Trading
   Statements that Mr Wilson confirmed to be false declared accounts that he was
   responsible for and he had completed. Also, I think the tape summaries
   mentioned the bank statements we seized at the voluntary search being
   discussed in some detail with Mr Wilson and the Solicitor.
                                                                                           WITN09160100
                                                                                      WITNO9160100




72. My only observations and response to the paragraphs 40 to 42 by Mrs Wilson
   at [WITN1680100] is as follows. Mrs Wilson mentions being a Police Officer for
   3 years and the voluntary search of both the home and car was exactly that,
   voluntary and agreed to by Mr Wilson at the time and therefore clearly no police
   warrant or their involvement was necessary as I would have expected Mrs
   Wilson may have known. The voluntary search forms were completed and duly
   signed by Mr Wilson with regards financial items seized. At Paragraph 41 Mrs
   Wilson mentions something about some kind of markings she had made on the
   bank statements we had seized as part of the search and then stated we had
   clearly not looked at them. Firstly, I would add these were looked at and were
   actually discussed with Mr Wilson and the Solicitor during the Taped Interviews
   as can be seen in documents [POL00050140] and [POL00050128] (previously
   mentioned). Secondly, I do find the fact Mrs Wilson stated she had made any
   such markings on their financial documents prior to the voluntary search that
   day somewhat unusual. At point 42 Mrs Wilson states that her husband told her
   later that the investigators had said he had been doing false accounting, but it
   was in fact her husband Mr Wilson, who had clearly already admitted to doing
   this to the auditors on their arrival on the day of the audit and that he had in fact
   been doing false accounting for at least 5 years. He confirmed this again to
   Graham Brander and myself during the taped interview and in the presence of
   his Astwood Law legal representative and the Post Office Friend. We did listen
   to what Mr Wilson was saying but asked him why he had not brought his so-
   called issues and concerns being Horizon or otherwise to anyone's attention for
   over 5 plus years. He did mention a couple of previous line managers but
   stated he had not mentioned the extent as to what was happening or the
   amount of the said losses. He had no specific examples of how it was the
   Horizon System responsible, and I had no reason at that time to doubt the
   Horizon System without any evidence or examples. Mr Wilson was clearly not
   charged either at that point as we are again not the Police and had to seek our
   own Legal Teams Advice. He was however later subject to a summons through
   the post to appear at court. I can confirm that yes, The Post Office had always
   looked for any forms of voluntary repayment under the terms of a
   Subpostmasters Contract and in this case with no repayment forthcoming that
   is why I assume a Financial Investigation recovery case was set up within that
   part of the team.
                                                                                        WITN09160100
                                                                                       WITNO9160100




73. The further evidence I was gathering was that I was looking to confirm what Mr
   Wilson stated, in that this had been going on for around 5 years. I was looking
   for evidence of potential phone calls to the Post Office Helpline stating he felt
   he had Horizon issues or otherwise. If not then calls to his Contracts Manager's
   maybe for help or assistance with maybe further training help or why it
   appeared his office was regularly haemorrhaging these kinds of losses on what
   appeared from him to be most weeks. He did mention two previous Contracts
   Managers he had mentioned Horizon concerns to after his first audit was found
   to be accurate after his initial 6 months at Astwood Bank. I can't recall now but
   imagine I would have tried to corroborate this after the interview by seeing if
   they were maybe still working within the business and had recollection or if any
   actual record was made at Contract Manager level. Sorry I can't recall what
   other checks would have been done. We asked Mr Wilson if he had any
   concerns over his staff stealing from him each week and he said he only had
   one other staff member who had worked there 20 plus years and while a
   possibility he did not think this was the case from my recollection.


74. The Contract Manager Glenn Chester and Post Office Helpline with recorded
   call logs from Mr Wilson's office at Astwood Bank assisted with the
   investigation. Basically, all the witnesses whose statements are within the case
   file.



75. Following the interview my investigation report along with the interview taped
   summaries would have been submitted for Legal Advice. This would have been
   done as Mr Wilson had admitted to False Accounting over 5 years but not theft.
   Any prosecution decision was only decided upon by our Post Office Solicitors
   Legal Team and on authority of a Senior Security Manager.


76. 1 have considered page 3 of [POL00044803] In relation to my comment that
   "The period of offending in this case could not be fully established" that meant
   just that. Mr Wilson admitted to the auditors and me and Mr Brander at the
   interview that he had been producing false trading statements every month by
   inflating the cash on hand and declaring an incorrect amount from around 2003
   to September 2008 (5 years) when he was audited. He could not recall or be
                                                                                      WITN09160100
                                                                                   WITNO9160100




    specific about the exact date he first did this and produced the first false
    account other than during 2003 so the exact date to date period of offending
    could therefore not be fully established.


77. 1 had no involvement in the decision to charge Mr Wilson, this would have been
    the Post Office Legal Team.


78.1 would have completed and submitted the Charges to Court for summons
    following advice from the Post Office Legal Team.


79. There was no direct involvement of the Police as Mr Wilson was not under
    arrest and had consented to both voluntary searches and a voluntary interview
    with his solicitors at Astwood Law. I would have submitted the Non Police
    Agencies forms NPA001/NPA002 following charges as per our obligation with
    Police to ensure their PNC was fully updated.


80. 1 would have completed the document [POL00119211]. As I recall all questions
       in all cases for NPA001/NPA002 completion were asked of the person following
    the interview if they were happy to assist. It was therefore fairly standard
    practice to complete these Antecedents / NPA forms and was therefore
    answers of how the person best described their appearance along with all the
    other questions for its completion. For example an IC1 was stated in PACE as -
    White-skinned European: English, Scottish, Welsh, French, German, Swedish,
    Norwegian, Polish, Russia. I would have asked Mr Wilson if he felt that best
       describes himself or anyone with whom I was completing this document.

    83. 1 was the Lead Investigator / Interview Officer in this case.


    84. The statement from me is requested if the Post Office Legal Team / Senior
        Manager decides upon a Prosecution in any particular case. It would obviously
        state the Lead and second interviewing officer along with the lead auditor on
        the day and possibly the contracts managers, Fujitsu personnel if ARQ Horizon
        Data was used etc. Therefore, the Post Office Legal Team would have asked
        me to provide a statement.



    85.1 can only recall from viewing the tape summaries attached, of any references
        made by Mr Wilson relating to the Horizon IT system and some Federation
        Document being circulated. I did not feel there was any significance as I had no
        doubts whatsoever regarding the Horizon System.


    86.1 would have given a full disclosure to Mr Wilson's Legal Representative prior to
        the interview so he could advise his client fully. Prosecution type disclosure I
        assume would have been advised and given by the Legal Team instructed.
                                                                                        WITNO9160100
                                                                                       WITNO9160100




87. In relation to my standard memo to the Legal Team at [POL00050733] where I
   stated, "the total monies missing that amounted to £27,811.98 have not been
   recovered", I was not concerned at all but purely stating the facts for the Legal
   Team that the monies identified as missing at the audit shortage and agreed by
   Mr Wilson were still outstanding. At that stage on completion of my memo there
   were no funds recovered and so this would now be a matter the Contracts
   Manager covered during any disciplinary interview or subsequently through the
   Post Office Security Recoveries / Financial Investigator Team.


88.Without sight of the GS018 document covering TIC's I can only assume it was
   covering either a selection or all of the numerous Weekly / Monthly Trading
   Statements declared false over the suggested 5 year period admitted to by Mr
   Julian Wilson.


89. The document from Anthony Vines at [POL00044751] appears to be his advice
   I can only assume prior to a first court appearance or PCMH (Plea & Case
   Management Hearing). This would be reporting back to the Post Office
   Solicitors regarding any potential further evidence that may be needed. This
   advice is likely to have been sent to the Legal Team and subsequently added
   to the Case papers.



90.The request made by Mr Wilson's solicitors dated the 14 May 2009 appears to
   have only been sent to our own counsel Anthony Vines as per his advice at
   [POL00044751] (previously mentioned) and would not have been something I
   would have immediate sight of or any knowledge as to what steps were taken.


91. Re [POL00051936]. I was not consulted on the basis of the plea put forward.
   These decisions were only made at Legal or Senior Manager level not by
   myself. Recoveries were advised to me when they were received but I have no
   recollection of any intentions of how other than the interview responses given
   by Mr Wilson. Again, I have no idea about any basis of plea as this would have
   again been through Jarnail Singh I guess and via Anthony Vines counsel and
   both Legal Representatives.
                                                                                       WITN09160100
                                                                                      WITNO9160100




92.1 had no involvement in the financial investigation and enforcement
   proceedings on this case.


93. In relation to the application of a restraint order, I have no idea who decided
   this, but I would suggest a Financial Investigator on the authority by the Head
   of Security.


94. 1 did not attend court for these proceedings as far as I recall.


95. With regards to the [POL00113278] document in particular paragraphs 175 -
   178 I am clearly very angry and upset myself, that like Mr Wilson I was also told
   like in in paragraph 176 "There Was Nothing Wrong With Horizon" this was a
   message that myself and as far as I am aware all my colleagues were clearly
   also led to believe as can be seen by my own email chain I sent to the Post
   Office Managing Director after this came to light to about my own feelings at
   document [POL00113304]. Although yes, Mr Wilson admitted to Fa►se
   Accounting for 5 years at interview had I had any inkling there were any such
   bugs or errors possible within Horizon then this data would obviously have
   been requested as a matter of course. With the losses attributed to my
   understanding that they could only be down to Mr Wilson or maybe his
   assistant this was why no theft charge could be established and the false
   accounting was obviously openly admitted to when the auditors arrived. If this
   data is now still available, I would welcome the inquiry requesting this
   information to support the fact Mrs Wilson wants to prove her husband's
   innocence and maybe these so called BED's (Bugs / Errors / Defects) as they
   appear to be referred to could be looked at to help Mrs Wilson finally prove her
   husband's innocence. Clearly the fact the Post Office hid the knowledge of
   these bugs, errors or defects has impacted on many individuals and brought
   into question the investigations myself and my colleagues tried to lead to the
   best of our ability with what was made aware of to us at the time. My anger and
   upset now to any subsequent injustice case is difficult to live with.

   xvi)      The unsigned witness statement of Graham Brander dated 25
   November 2011 at [POL00057267] (page 1) and [POL00044535] (pages 2 to
   7);
   xvii)     The list of exhibits at [POL00046100].


97.1 must honestly confess to no real recollection of this case other than the
                                                                                        WITNO9160100

   assisted documents produced at Point 95 and paragraph 91 above.


98. I would refer specifically to the Help Desk witness Louise Sheridan and her
   exhibit (LS/1) at [POL00054806] and the Tape Recorded Interview regarding
   the consistently increased £50 notes entries at point 74 (iii) [POL00056417],
   [POL00044505] and [POL00046625]. As can be seen Lynette Hutchings went
   "NO COMMENT" throughout the interview when her opportunity to give an
   explanation was there as well as to the consistent £50 Note increases shown or
   if she had any other concerns. My involvement came from a request from my
   colleague Graham Brander as to my availability to assist him as second officer
   at interview and my role was to be the second officer at the interview.



99. 1 had no involvement in relation to the reason and decision to interview as this
   was the case of my colleague Graham Brander.


100_   The evidence shown in the interview would have been described in the
   interview taped summaries at [POL00056417], [POL00044505] and
   [POL00046625] (previously mentioned) and exhibited within any witness
   statements obtained by Graham Brander.



101. I had no involvement in the decision to charge. — this would have been the
   Legal Team / Solicitors at the time on authority of Senior Security Manager.


102.   Graham Brander would have asked me to provide a witness statement.



103. I was not aware, at any time that I was involved, of any allegations made by
   Ms Hutchings relating to the reliability of the Horizon IT system as she went
   "NO COMMENT" in the entire interview when her opportunity was then to give
   a reason or explanation or to raise any concerns or specific examples. This
   may have been seen and included in the prepared statement.
                                                                                            WITN09160100
                                                                                        WITNO9160100




104. I have considered the handwritten documents at [POL00046095] and
   [POL00046096] and Counsel's attendance note dated 30 July 2012 at
       [POL00058132] (which appears to have been sent under cover of the email
   dated 30 August 2012 at [POL00058252] and the email at [POL00058153]). I
   have no previous sight or knowledge of any of these documents as they would
   only have been seen by Graham Brander the lead officer in this case.



105. I am unable to comment accurately as this was my colleague Graham
   Brander's case. The paragraphs 267 to 272 of [POL00113278] have been
   read. However, with 33 calls made to the Business Helpline Lynette Hutchings
   apparently only mentioned twice about losses and gains issues which was why
   I have referred to that specific exhibit L/S1. She stated that advice at POL was
       difficult to access and unreliable and yet clearly, she had made at least 33 calls
   to the Helpline, so I am unsure as to what difficulty she was therefore
   describing. I would imagine but can't say that ARQ data if received would have
   been viewed and used at the interview especially with regards to showing these
   £50 Notes shown to be increasing consistently but maybe my colleague could
   assist on this further. Then finally at the interview when she had the perfect
   opportunity to air and raise any or all of these apparent long term ongoing
       issues fully, she chose to use her right to go "No Comment". It states that ARQ
       data was requested but unknown if received. The only other point I find slightly
   worrying or surprising is that I think in her evidence she mentioned issues
   occurring at her previous Post Office where she was the Subpostmistress and
       had substantial losses. I guess she must have put this cash in out of her own
   money and yet surprisingly after doing this and if she believed the Horizon
       System to be the cause she still decided to purchase another Post Office. I
   have no further points to add on this case as this was led by Graham Brander.


POL v Susan Rudkin


106. I have reviewed the following documents:
  i.      The Audit Report, dated 21 August 2008 [POL00046550]
 ii.      The handwritten notes at [POL00045243] and [POL00045246];
                                                                                       WITNO9160100
                                                                                      WITNO9160100




 iii.   The Record of Tape-Recorded Interview of 20 August 2008 at
        [POL00050026];
 iv.    The suspect offender report [POL00050123];
  v.    The Investigation Report dated 2 September 2008 at [POL00046485]
 vi.    The Antecedents form for Susan Rudkin dated 2 September 2008 at
        [POL00046576];
vii.    Jarnail Singh's memo to the Fraud Team dated 3 October 2008 at
        [POL00046488];
viii.   The Schedule of Charges at [POL00045220];
 ix.    David Pardoe's email to the Fraud Team dated 7 October 2008 at
        [POL00050347];
  x.    The memo from Mike Wilcox to Jarnail Singh dated 29 January 2009 at
        [POL00046505];
 xi.    Jarnail Singh's memo to the Fraud Team dated 6 February 2009 at
        [POL00046506];
xii.    The memo from Debbie Helszajn to the Fraud Team dated 26 March 2009 at
        [POL00051256];
xiii.   The memo from Rob Wilson to the Fraud Team dated 6 May 2009 at
        [POL00051420].


107. I was involved in this case as I was the second officer assisting Mike
    Wilcox, the lead officer in this case. The Investigation Report at
    [POL00046485] and Tape Summary at [POL00050026] best cover the full and
    detailed account of Mr Wilcox's case and includes, the evidence that Legal
    Representation as in every case was offered and covered by the completion of
    the GS001 Legal Rights Form on tape. This was always explained fully, signed
    and contained within the case papers and part of the evidence. It can also be
    seen that Mr Wilcox agreed to allow her son (Dale) to sit in on the interview to
    act as her friend for moral support.


108.    From the document [POL00046485] (previously mentioned) it appears I
    was actually with Mike Wilcox on Wednesday 20th August 2008 when he was
    assigned this case by Colin Price (Temp Area Team Manager) and we were
    diverted to Ibstock Post Office where I was to assist him as his second officer
    at an interview with Susan Rudkin following the audit result.
                                                                                       WITN09160100
                                                                                      WITNO9160100




109.   This was Mike Wilcox's case, so I had no involvement in the initial
   investigation that was raised following an audit shortage on the day and an
   admission to the auditors by Susan Rudkin that she was solely responsible.


110.   The decision to charge and prosecute would have been the current Team
   Leader but from the report at [POL00046485] (previously mentioned) it would
   appear it was Colin Price who was quite likely covering as the Temporary Area
   Team Leader.



111.   The evidence shown to Mrs Rudkin was that which was shown during the
   interview [POL00050026] and that was subsequently exhibited as part of the
   evidence by Mike Wilcox.


112. I had no involvement in the decision to charge or prosecute. I would also
   have no involvement in this as in any of my own cases as this would be
   advised by the Post Office Legal Team / Solicitors at the time.



113.   As far as I recall I was not aware, at any time that I was involved, of any
   allegations made by Ms Rudkin relating to the reliability of the Horizon IT
   system and she didn't suggest this at the interview as I could see or recall. In
   fact she had actually said she had taken physical cash from the Post Office and
   paid this into her own Business Bank Account (Lloyds I think) to cover
   numerous financial shortfalls and bills etc following a previous robbery at the
   branch and she did this without her husbands or the staff's knowledge.


114. I have no reason to doubt that the investigation was again conducted in the
   correct way by my colleague Mike Wilcox and with the knowledge and evidence
   he relied upon to be 100% accurate as far as we were aware at that time.



115.   The fact there were many many thousands of Horizon terminals in operation
                                                                                       WITN09160100
                                                                                      WITNO9160100




   across several thousand Post Offices causing no issues or errors indicated that
   these were as had been historically the minority cases of possible misconduct
   and there were absolutely no Horizon integrity issues whatsoever. All
   investigators had no reason to doubt the Horizon system with absolutely no
   knowledge of these bugs, errors or defects ever existed.


116. I had absolutely no knowledge or awareness that any bugs, errors or
   defects existed in Horizon.



117.   As above, I was unaware any existed so would have no idea if Fujitsu
   passed any such information to Post Office Ltd and if they ever did it certainly
   was not passed to me or my colleagues.


118. I was a loyal, honest and trusted member of staff and I am clearly very
   angry and upset that my employer of 32 years, if known, never advised anyone
   that these so-called bugs, errors or defects existed in the Horizon system. In
   my opinion at whatever level, especially Senior Manager's level if any
   knowledge or doubts existed this should have been brought to absolutely
   everyone's attention immediately including staff and Postmasters. It would then
   have been included as a reason that could undermine any case under
   disclosure.



119.   The [POL00113304] document (previously mentioned) is now clearly
   interesting for me. You can see that even after leaving the Post Office back in
   2017, I was still under the impression, clearly wrongly, that Horizon was 100%
   accurate. When the Horizon Inquiry started, and cases went to the High Court
   etc I was still none the wiser. However, when the press and television
   subsequently released details of possible Managing Directors, Chairman &
   Senior Managers knowing these existed, I was mortified and extremely angry.
   Then when cases in the High Court became successful, I was even more angry
   as not so much as an apology was received from the Post Office. As you can
   hopefully see so much from the initial email, I sent it to Nick Read in 2021. I
   have clearly not seen these internal email chain responses until now which do
                                                                                       WITN09160100
                                                                                      WITNO9160100




   make interesting reading. Again, compensation worries appear to be their
   primary focus and yes whilst I do think this would also be appropriate to staff
   clearly affected all I really wanted was some form of an apology and
   explanation. I'm more than happy to give that apology now myself to any
   Postmasters who were 100% proven to be unfairly prosecuted.


120. If anyone in the Post Office Senior Team were aware of these possible bugs
   / errors or defects within Horizon, they did not communicate this and any
   correctly identified or proven miscarriages of justice by the Post Office should
   be both quashed and compensated in my opinion.
