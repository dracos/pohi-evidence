Draft. Branch data and balancing issue

This note is to respond to some recent concerns about data during branch balancing
processes.

In draft as yet to ensure it makes sense to those not so closely involved in the
issues.

The issue sometimes known as the "Receipts and Payments Mismatch" has come up in some
recent emails. There have been several business discussions about how to resolve it
and an option had been referred to which, if adopted, would have led to adjustments
being made direct in Horizon.

For clarity, whilst this was (for completeness) flagged as an option, my understanding
is that it has always been rejected as it would undermine the long standing principle
that all entries in Horizon be initiated or authorised by the branch.

It is undoubtedly possible with any IT system that special mechanisms could be
developed to adjust users systems and data, however, POL IT colleagues have remained
satisfied:

(A) that POL would not wish this facility to be built for Horizon, and

(B) that there are segregations of duties and change management controls which would
prevent Fujitsu from deploying such functionality

The specific "R&P" issue has arisen from a non compliant series of user actions in
branch and applies to a small number of branches. Whilst some branches had been
concerned that data had "disappeared" the relevant balance had actually been moved to
the wrong place but was still visible.

A solution and a covering explanatory note for branches are currently being worked up
through a group involving IT, Finance and Network colleagues.

Thanks Rod
