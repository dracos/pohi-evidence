while investigating PC0241216; State:4 Banking txn, I identified a separate issue.

n 21/2/15 User started SESSION: 1-893961
This session contained two transactions:

1. Health Lottery txn 00-145925-1-3891960-1
Banking txn 00-145925-1-3891961-1

aa

Whe Health Lottery txn 00-145925-1-3891960-1 was authorised and the receipt was printed.
However PM didn’t settle the txn basket.

While still logged on Node:1, PM then logged on Node:2 at 14:20pm.

Jser: HPAQO2 was warned about the concurrent login and the session on Node:1 will fail. But the PM carried on login on Node:2.
Whis caused Both txns to fail on Node:1.

n 23/2/15 when the user attempted to logon on Node:1, the recovery kicked-in. But the recovery failed due to Health lottery
DeScript failure and preventing User Logon. Currently this is in @ loop.

Please raise a TFS call with ATOS and ask POL to formally authorise us to delete this Health Lottery session so that office is
lable to use Node:1 again. This will enable the office to use Node:1 again quickly.

If nothing is done then after 5 days both tx:

(Good afternoon Patricia,

I hope you're well.

Apologies to involve you in this issue again; I've been looking into the ticket and it looks like crossed wires have led to
onfusion over deletion of the session at Lydd Post Office. With Meanwood being referenced a number of times in the below
jemail chain, I believe there has been a misunderstanding on the Service Desk as to whether authorisation was being provided
ifor Meanwood, Lydd, or neither Branch.

‘he frequency of these issues has been noted and as of early March there is a Problem Record open from our side to try to
establish why this is occurring so frequently for Health Lottery, and how it can be stopped. To be candid we’re currently

F/1320/5

y

relying on an interim process and it was arguably only a matter of time before we hit an issue (Anne being out of office).

present we are looking at a frozen counter where the only viable means of restoring service to the Branch is to delete the
data which is causing this; unfortunately Atos are not permitted to authorise this as per Fujitsu's stringent processes.

If this makes sense, I’d be really grateful if you'd be able to send me just a few words stating you are happy for the
transaction to be removed at Lydd.

f course, please let me know if you've any questions, though. Apologies once again for involving you in this.

Best regards,

ames Egan

i Tan/Sharon

Please see below and attached another issue where we are being asked to authorise removal of a transaction without any
lnderstanding of the issue. I am aware recently of Meanwood office where Anne Allaker exceptionally gave authorisation for the
removal of the transaction. (Please note Anne is on annual leave this week)

Below is an e-mail Anne sent to yourselves regarding this issue: Could you please advise if this was resolved as currently I
ave not given authorisation to remove this transaction and the office will need to be advised, the office is unable to
rollover or balance correctly.

E

vhis appears to be saying that the banking transaction recovery has worked correctly without any impact to branch or customer.
‘he recovery of the health lottery transaction however was not successful.

Tt appears that the postmaster followed the on screen prompts and proc y can that you confirm that for me please?
It doesn’t tell me whether there’s any impact to branch or customer for the Health Lottery Transaction but Pat has kindly rung
che branch and confirmed the customer isn’t impacted, nothing changed hands for the Health Lottery transaction, and there is
no branch discrepancy.

I’m therefore happy to authorise this session to be deleted so that the kit at the branch can return to BAU state.
I still need to understand the background to this type of enquiry, what has happened in the past, where would authorisation
ave been requested from. If a branch has followed process correctly that may explain why Network haven’t been asked for
uthorisation in the past but without identifying root cause or knowing past cases I don’t know where this should sit or why
Network need to make the authorisation.

[mat needs to happen now is that the reason for the unsuccessful recovery of the health lottery transaction needs to be
established so that if this scenario happens again the branch or customer isn’t impacted. who has responsibility for taking
hat. forward please?
