1. Problem & Major Incident Management
1.1 Weekly Tasks
1.1.1 Virtual Whiteboard Clean-up

At the beginning of each week, it is beneficial to perform a simple tidy up of the Incident Whiteboard found on
SharePoint:

This consists of aligning closed incidents on TfS in the Virtual Whiteboard (VWB).
1. Open the VWB
2. Month by month check for open incidents by filtering out those that are not labelled as closed (Closed — ‘Y’)

3. Open TfS. Copy the incident number into TfS and check if incident is closed (this is in the top right corner — ‘Active’
if ‘No’, then the incident has been closed, if ‘Yes’, then the incident is still open)

@ wo." serice vex fae 2
ae simy_ksiiny totes tte, Adee itn tive

ae — joa

wou _ ‘a wads

ss _ a a

tyne a — en

= —

os

4. Change the ‘Closed’ status in the VWB to ‘Y’.

5. Update the ‘End Time’ to reflect when the incident was resolved. To do this you need to read through the logged
comments in the incident to find the most relevant update showing when the incident was resolved.

6. Update the ‘Root Cause’ to reflect what the cause of the incident was. Similarly, to do this you need to read
through the logged comments in the incident to find the most relevant update for the cause of the incident.

7. Repeat this for all open incidents in the VWB, this may take a while so spread it over the week as a background
task if need be.

1.1.2 ATOS Problem Spreadsheet

Every Tuesday afternoon you will be responsible for distributing the Problem Spreadsheet to ATOS Problem
Management (Richard Benton & Robert Shaw) with Fujitsu updates which are discussed on the weekly Problem
Management call every Friday.

1. Open the last spreadsheet sent from ATOS Problem Management.
2. For each problem record, insert the date, your name, and then the update for the week
3. For problem records currently sitting with ATOS, update with ‘Awaiting ATOS update’

4. For problem records sitting with Fujitsu, each update can be based on any work you or Tony have undertaken in
the past week in relation to that problem. If you are stuck for an update, discuss with Tony and he'll point you in the
right direction for who is responsible for the work in that Problem Record.

5. When completed, save file with the date you have updated the spreadsheet and save to your documents.

(REY wey soe se nee a 721

7. At the end of each month, upload the latest updated spreadsheet for that month, including the latest copy sent
through from ATOS on the Friday, into the Problem Management SharePoint area in ‘Weekly problem Reports’:

1.1.3 Problem Management Call with ATOS

Every Friday morning, you and Tony Wicks hold a Problem review call with ATOS Problem Management to discuss
the ongoing problem records within the spreadsheet. ATOS will send a spreadsheet with their updates on the Friday
morning before the meeting which will be discussed. Before each meeting it is best to discuss these with Tony Wicks
and make sure you are set for discussion with the customer before entering the room unprepared. The call consists
of going down each Problem Record and giving a view of its latest status, followed by an AOB opportunity.

Before every meeting, Atos Problem Management will send through an email with the updated spreadsheet
attached. This will be the spreadsheet that is used in the discussion on the call. The example of the email received is
as below. Attached is also the example of the spreadsheet.

1.1.4 Action Spreadsheet

Asa result of Major and Post Incident Reports, there are a number of actions which can easily become difficult to
manage with a high number of reports open at once (see sections 1.2 & 1.3), so we have a central spreadsheet where
we keep record of all the actions from both Major and Post Incident Reports. This can be found at:

http://emeia.fujitsu.local/03/sites/T17/00672/Service_Management/Service%20Support/Forms/Allltems.aspx?Root
Folder=%2F03%2Fsites%2FT17%2F00672%2FService_Management%2FService%20Support%2F Post%20Incident%20R

ODD6-41FE-957D-1£43327616FC%7D

Your role is to maintain this spreadsheet:
1. Whenever a new MIR/PIR is generated, add this to the spreadsheet with all of the actions associated.
2. When an action is closed, move this to the closed tab and give a summary of closure.

3. At the beginning of each week, send the spreadsheet out to all action owners via email and copy in Steve Bansal —
as a reminder of the urgency to complete their actions to aid in lessons learnt to avoid repeat occurrences.

4. If you get no response, send individual chasers and even phone / set up meetings to discuss progress with action
owners.

5. If you get an update, place this into the spreadsheet and continue tracking.

1.1.5 OBC19 Spreadsheet

Every Wednesday the Release Management hold an OBC19 Review Meeting to discuss issues relating to file transfers
via the Post Office Data Gateway (PODG): new PODG routes deployment, routes deletion, progress of PODG
incidents etc. You will be asked to update the last 2 tabs of OBC19 Spreadsheet — PODG Issues and PODG
Decommissioning tab.

PODG issues tab is updated by adding new incidents that might be raised for file transfer issues. Include the client
name, PODG route name, TfS and ATOS reference and a brief description of the issue. Newly added incidents and
updates need to be marked in green.

We (f) have been unable to connect to the 3rd Party Server (RIS) since 07:20 on 2nd August 17 and hence we have a back log of
files awaiting transfer. it would appear that ATOS might be having problems identifying who they should be contacting; the
incident was raised with UK 3rdP.CSCSTERIASAPHR. A company called Lumesse (Lee Pearce) were involved in the testing phase
back in 2012, Paula Hillsden provided contact details for Lumesse representative. We (Fl) are awaiting ATOS IM to liaise with
the third party representative. The third party (Lumesse) performed an IP address change at their end on the 2nd Aug 17. The
Ichange was unannounced to both ATOS and Fl, however there had been some communication between POL and Lumesse. An OBC

HRSA _IRIS request (OBC105 ~Route Change with Network Changes) now needs to be submitted into Fl from ATOS. There are currently 28

Every day SMC Team send an update on the PODG incidents (PODG calls logged between...), so check these in the
first instance. Still, if you are unsure what incidents to add, request Steve Gardiner for asisstance. He normally
attends the meeting as well and has access to PODG Reporter to check file activity on a given route (if Steve is
unavailable, FJ SMC and FJ Unix may assist in checking).

The second tab is PODG Decommissioning issues. These are incidents raised for PODG routes that are no longer
operational but have not been yet deactivated. There are normally no updates on this tab so just change the dates.
Once every 2-3 months you might approach Steve Bansal to find whether he got any update via the monthly Service
Review. The update then might look as follows:

[25/01/17 The last Wincor Kiosk was decommissioned on 28th March 2015, with their contract ending on 31st
March 2015 for Post Office so there is no longer any contact with Wincor. For an extended period we have
lbeen receiving empty files (84 K) in sie. This now appears to have come to an end. No WINCOR Post and Go

1.1.6 KEL Review Forum

The KEL is the master knowledge base for all incidents being progressed through the support chain. It was developed
by the SSC who also maintain the servers it runs on.

The KEL Review Forum is a meeting held weekly to update this master knowledge database, accessed via SSC
website: https://ssc.fs.fujitsu.com/SSC3/homepage.jsp

1. Compile Agenda: The SMC Team are to send through a list of KELs for discussion each Tuesday. It normally
contains 10 KELs. These need to be included in the KEL Agenda, along with Criteria for Review. Example below:

Hold Skype KRF Session: The KRF Meeting takes place Thursdays at 14:00. During the meeting you will need to share
your screen with participants, presenting the KELs that are being discussed. You also read out the criteria for review
& comments (2 screens come in handy...).

Right under the list of KELs for discussion, there’s also a table with actions. You are required to request participants
about any update and make a note if provided. At the end of the Meeting you do a quick round the table, and if
anyone raises an AOB (Any Other Business) item, make a note in a table along an appropriate action no.

The actions following the KRF need to be shared with the assignees (normally SMC get all the actions).
The SMC Management confirms back the actions are completed prior to the next Forum.

If there are KELs with no clear action agreed (i.e. SMC/SSC are unsure how to proceed and need to consult other FJ
SDUs), the KELs needs to be published in the next Agenda, until update on KEL is agreed.

2. Ensure there is a spreadsheet for the following weeks date and open the sheet

3. Look down the spreadsheet and if there are any gaps, you need to email members from the teams and ask them
to provide updates before the end of the day.

4, Ensure the spreadsheet has been updated for our Duty Manager team. If not, discuss with Tony Wicks/Steve
Gardiner and ask who is Primary / Secondary Duty Manager for the week and update the sheet accordingly. This also
applies for the Out of Hours Duty Manager — this information can be found on the POA OHH Duty Manager Rota
provided by Jean Woolley, ask Tony for sight of this if you haven’t already been given one.

5. You are also responsible to update the GDC details on the call out rota. The GDC team has a separate rota that you
would need to copy the details from and into the Account Call-Out Rota. Their rota can be found at:

1.1.8 Weekly Reports
1.1.8.1 Incident Report

Each Friday, you are required to generate the weekly reports for the account from Problem & Major Incident
Management. This is handed over to Steve Gardiner on the Friday afternoon who then provides updates on
Monday/Tuesday the following week reflecting incidents that occurred over the weekend.

1. Open the VWB
2. Review each incident from the Monday to the Friday that week

3. Only incidents that either have an ATOS incident reference or need to be shared with the customer need to be
added. Those labelled ‘Internal FJ’ are not to be added to the weekly report.

4. For each incident in the weekly report, the summary consists of the incident date, high level summary of the
incident, high level root cause & resolution of the incident and Fujitsu/ATOS incident references. If ATOS have not
provided an incident reference at the time of producing the weekly report, then leave as ‘No ATOS incident
provided’.

5. Update the date of the report showing the week ending date, then send to Steve Gardiner in a ‘DM Friday-Monday
Handover’ email, ready for when Steve comes back into the office on Monday.

To see an example report ask Tony Wicks / Steve Gardiner.

1.1.8.2 PEAK Reporting

Each Thursday, you are required to generate a PEAK Report for Steve Bansal in preparation for the Leadership Team
Meeting on Friday. The instructions to produce the PEAK report are detailed in the document ‘PEAK Reporting’
below. To produce this report, you would need to have access to PEAK and FSR (using your TfS user).

As PEAK Reporting is used to keep track of the trend of PEAKs, when there is a sudden increase or decrease of PEAKs,
do a little drill down to enable better understanding of why it has happened. Run a query on PEAK for what area you
would like to drill down.

There are 3 main spreadsheets to help produce this report. The spreadsheet titled ‘PEAK Weekly Totals’ contains
historical data to help with trend analysis. The spreadsheet titled ‘16-06-2016’ is a spreadsheet created weekly that
contains data extracted for the PEAK report of that week. The spreadsheet titled ‘TfS Totals’ is a template to help
produce the report for the TfS section of the PEAK Report.

1.2 Major Incident Reports

Asa Major Incident manager, your highest priority role is to manage live service, even more so when there is a high
priority incident that can have a potential service impact. In the event of a Major Incident, you alongside the rest of
the team will be expected to drop whatever you are doing to manage the issue in the most effective way.

There are a variety of ways and reasons for Major Incidents which you may be involved in, but an important role for
the IP is to assist with the documentation that follows. In the event of a Major Incident, we have 24 hours to produce
a first draft report to ATOS who provide the detail to Post Office Ltd., detailing the Major Incident, from a specific
timeline of events to the root cause and resolution actions taken. The Major Incident Procedure document is useful
to flick through and gain an understanding SVD/SDM/PRO/0001.

When producing the Major Incident Report, you will be assisted by the Duty Manager who was running with the
incident, who will provide you with a detailed timeline of events, including calls that were made and resolution steps
taken by the individual teams. With this information you will do the typing of the first draft using the account
template SVM/SDM/INR/2693.

Once you have completed the report, you will review with the relevant parties, e.g. Duty Manager involved and
Steve Bansal, before sending the report to Steve Bansal. From this point Steve will make final edits and send to the
customer. Your main job is to type up the report and make sure all detail is recorded, Steve will make the decision to
remove any unnecessary detail.

1.3 Post Incident Reviews

Following a Major Incident, we will normally hold a Post Incident Review (PIR) internally. This is so all parties
involved can discuss the incident, run through the timeline and make sure everyone agrees on the events. In doing
so, the aim is to build a view of lessons to be learnt and generate actions to fulfil this in an attempt to avoid any
repeat occurrence of the incident.

Your role:

1. Set up the PIR, sending invites to all people involved in the incident (ask the Duty Manager if you’re unsure who
needs to be involved)

2. Take the minutes throughout the PIR. The minutes will consist of a walkthrough of the incident, including a
number of observations. An observation is a point where there could be improvement, or a question is asked as to
why it was handled in that way etc.

3. Your opportunity to ask any questions or suggest ways of improving a process to minimise the likelihood of a
repeated mistake.

4. Observations made will be tied to actions. Either no further action is required, i.e. the answer is given in the PIR
and there is nothing more that can be done OR an action will be generated in accordance to the observation made.

5. Run through the observations and actions at the end of the PIR to ensure all parties are content.

6. After the PIR, you will need to spend some time tidying up the minutes taken, removing points that aren’t needed
and generating actions etc.

7. Once you are happy with the document and have reviewed with Tony and the Duty Manager then you need to
upload the first draft to Dimensions and distribute to all Ived fe iew. You can do this by emailing the
document to PostOfficeAccountDocumentManagementi....

1.4 Major Incident Report Tracker

Asa result of Major Incidents and Post Incident Reviews, the Business & Application Services Team have a tracker to

1.6 CP CT Tracker

As part of the Communication Cell for the BAS Weekly Team Meeting, you will also be responsible for updating the
CP CT Tracker. This is a spreadsheet that is used to keep track of the number of days allocated/impacted by the BAS
team for a certain Change Proposal (CP). You will not be providing any impacts as this is done my other indivi

Check out the document and add the impacts and CPs accordingly. As this task is correlated to the CP Impacting
Meeting on Tuesdays, you can update the spreadsheet after every meeting to ensure the CP’s and impacts are up to
date. Details for columns A to E are found in the CP itself. To obtain the CP, go to the BAS SDM Mailbox and open up
the email with the CP you are looking for. These CP’s are usually sent by

PostOfficeAccountCustomerServicel GRO).

Only CP’s titled ‘Urgent’ are added to your spreadsheet. This task is related to the CP Impacting ( See 6. CP Impacting
Meeting of this document) and Customer Service (See 8. Customer Service of this document).

1.7 HORIce

HORIce is the screen on the right, showing a number of our live services and their running status. Here is a summary
of the status colours the screen may show:

Green — Service is running ok
Red — Critical alert, failures within Fujitsu domain

Amber — Failure alerts in the external domain - less of an issue for Fujitsu, but needs monitoring and managing in the
appropriate way with ATOS Service Desk to liaise with 3 party who are seeing high failure counts

Purple — Service is reporting behind schedule - this is a simple call up to the SSC if it prolongs to ensure it is running
ok

Blue — Service is harvesting data - this usually only lasts around 30 to 60 seconds and is just updating the latest
status, again, if this prolongs, simple call up to the SSC

Grey — Not Running - HORIce is not running data for the service, if this prolongs for longer than a minute or so then
call SSC and ask to investigate.

For when a service is showing as RED, this is the most critical alert for us as it indicates there are failures that can
potentially be service impacting as a result of errors within our domain.

When any service shows critical, first this to do is voice MAC team and ask them to raise an incident and pass call to
relevant teams. Speak to Tony Wicks / Steve Gardiner to see where the calls should be routed to. Number for MAC

FUJ00085985
FUJ00085985

1.8 Tech Bridge

When there is a major incident or an incident of high priority, you may be required to join a Technical Bridge. This is
an internal call between Fujitsu Post Office Account service lines in order to discuss an incident and move to
resolution as promptly as possible. This is an urgent call, so if you are required to join, then this becomes your
greatest priority.

Your main role within a Tech Bridge is to take the minutes and record everything discussed as it may be of use ina
following report e.g. Major Incident Report. This call can become very technical so while it is important to try and

understand what is going on, it is vital that you capture all details and in particular the times at which updates are
given. This level is detail is crucial if a report is needed for the customer.

Details of joining the Tech Bridge will be provided as and when necessary as they may be subject to change, however
the general joining details for the Tech Bridge are:

Diali, i Participant ID is 38461819#. If you are needed to chair the Tech Bridge, the Chairperson ID is 92796518#.

There is also a Service Bridge, which is for external use, so third party clients can join the bridge if it is a cross domain
issue and needs urgent resolution.

Again, details for joining the Service Bridge may be subject to change, however the general joining details are:

Dial

articipant ID is 36081855# the Chairperson ID is 57863059#.

1.9 Virtual Whiteboard Incident Input

Part of the teams working way is to include all incidents of necessary priority into our team Virtual Whiteboard. This
is a yearly Excel spreadsheet with a monthly breakdown of each incident of note.

Incidents that we input into the Whiteboard are mainly Major Incidents/P1s (Priority 1 in TfS), those that have been
shared with ATOS Service Desk, incidents caused by change and in general those that have taken a fair amount of
effort to resolve.

When placing an incident into the Whiteboard, the main information that is required from the call is the date and
time of the incident, incident summary, Fujitsu and ATOS (if available) call references, impact and root cause.

You can find the Virtual Whiteboard at the bottom of this page:

Irrelevant

If you are unsure whether or not to place an incident into the Whiteboard then discuss with one of the team.

FUJ00085985

1.10 Yearly Problem Review

Once a year, Problem Management produce a Problem Review for the previous years’ problem records. Detailed
instruction on how to complete this can be found in SVM/SDM/PRO/0025 the POA Problem Management Procedure.

The review is made up of two phases. First, you need to undergo analysis of each problem record opened and/or
closed in that year. These are broken down into three categories:

Type 1— Problems in Fujitsu domain or further analysis is required.
Type 2 — Administration Closures, e.g., the problem record was raised in error against the incorrect resolver group.

Type 3 — Underlying issue was found to have originated in a third party domain.

See below the 2015 Problem Review as a reference for how to complete the following years review.

2015 - Problem
Records Review - 0.2

The second phase consists of organising a meeting with the relevant people involved in the ‘Fujitsu domain’ problem
records, to discuss if anything further can be done or if anything can be learnt.

All of the above is covered in more detail in document SVM/SDM/WKI/2399 Problem & Major Incident Management
Team Work Instructions. This handover document is for use as a basic guide.

2. Finance
2.1 BAS Monthly SST Breakdown

FUJ00085985
FUJ00085985

Once a month, you are required to produce a Breakdown of the figures in BAS Profit and Loss Statement. At the

4. Service Level Targets (SLTs)

4.1 Data Centre SLTs

Every month, you and Yannis Symvoulidis are responsible to enter SLTs into a spreadsheet as this will feed into MJ’s
monthly report. To perform this task, you would need to have access to HORIce. Any issues regarding HORIce, send
an email to POAHORICE! I or speak to John Simpkins in SSC up on the 6" Floor. Attached below is a set
of work instructions on how to perform the task. Contact Yannis Symvoulidis for any queries.

i)

DC Ops Work
Instructions.docx

The SLTs are recorded in an excel spreadsheet that can be found on RMG_BU_Business_Support (U: ) Drive > Service
Review Book > SLT charts > Data Centre Operations Service.

4.2 POLSAP SLTs

Every month, you and Yannis will also be responsible for the SLT input for POLSAP. As POLSAP currently do not have a
requirement for SLTs, these are still recorded in a specific area for audit purposes. At the beginning of each month,
you will receive an email from Sandeep Bhamare which will contain 2 spreadsheets. The example of the email is as
below:

hamare, Sande

Update Monthly SUT data for POLSAP - May 2016

1008 (SLT. 95% TARGET)

10086 (SUT: 200% TARGEN)

Once you've received this email, you can start recording the SLTs in the correct area. Some of the SLT’s feed into the
Data Centre SLTs. Go to RMG_BU_Business_Support (U: ) Drive > Service Review Book > SLT charts > Data Centre
Operations Service. The details in this email will fill in SLTs 5 to SLT 8 on this spreadsheet.

5.1 Scorecard Weighting Factor

Page 42 of 52
FUJ00085985
FUJ00085985

Each quarter you will be required to apply a weighting factor to the scoring received by the customer, below is a
guide to completing this:

1. Open the weighting factor table

CSAT Weighted
score.xlsx

2. You will only be updating the ‘Applied Weight’ and ‘Score’ column, leave the other columns as they are, the
calculations will be applied automatically.

3. Update the ‘Score’ column with the CSAT scores received from the customer (these will usually be sent to you by
Pete Thompson)

4. For the services that have not received a score, change the ‘Applied Weight’ column to 0 and leave the ‘Score’ field
blank.

Do not put a 0 in the ‘Score’ field as this will give a poor average calculation.

5. If a service has received a score, then the ‘Applied Weight’ field for that service should reflect the number in the
‘Weight’ column. E.g. If Online — POLSAP received a score, the ‘Applied Weight’ should be 2. If it did not received a
score, the applied weight should be changed to 0.

6. The CMT, Engineering and HSD service scores will usually be found in the Comments field of the CSAT scorecard
for End User Services. (The average of the three scores makes up the End User Services score)

7. The ‘Score’ total give you the Overall Operational Service score, and the ‘Weighting Score’ total give you the
Weighted Measure. Update the scorecard to reflect these figures.

I have left some figures in the table as a completed example and highlighted the two columns that need editing.

5.2 POLSAP Slides for the SMR Pack

Every Tuesday at 2pm, you will be required to hold a CP Impacting meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to allow
attendees to determine their impacts towards a particular Change Proposal (CP). Your role in this meeting as the

8. Customer Service

In case you are ever asked to provide working cover for Jean Woolley, the Operations Service Controller for the
account, the below documents should be a good starting point, but discuss the process in detail with Jean before the
cover is needed.

8.1 CP Database

The CP database can be found by going to My Computer > Map Network Drive > Drive drop down: ‘V’ > Folder:
Europemuk097\RMG_ BU Cust Serv > Finish

This will open the folder in a new window. Go to ‘All Change Proposal FORMS&Documents’ > CPDatabase > CP
Database (Microsoft Access file)

Ask Jean for access to the Cust_Serv folder.

8.2 Adding Impacts to Dimensions

One of the tasks you'll be required to do is add CP impacts into Dimensions to send to Change Management as and
when they come through into the Customer Service mailbox. Ask Jean to grant you access to this mailbox.

8.3 Sending Out a New CP

The other main task you'll need to do is send out a new CP as and when they come into the Customer Service
mailbox from Change Management. You then forward these on to the D-Lists provided by Jean. Ask Jean to share
these with you.

The document below covers the work instructions on performing tasks 7.2 and 7.3:

renewed will expire. For example, when a Purchase Order shows an end date of 31% March 2017 it would be placed
