Hi Ben,
In relation to your questions;

The very first LEA letter (attached dated Dec 2015) was for Security Managers to pass to the OIC of any case they were
involved with. Unfortunately there was no definitive list of who / which cases these were sent to. There may be entries
of the case log but to trawl through every single case log would be a mammoth task.

The October LEA letter (attached) was again for SMs to pass to the OIC in cases they were dealing with. Again there was
no central log but would be on the case log which would be a mammoth task to sift through.

On both of these occasions the letter would not have been sent to any CPS offices, only to cases being dealt with as
liaison (more than likely Police)

Also attached are the addresses of the CPS offices the new LEA letter was sent. The letters only differed as they
contained the address of the CPS office, the body of the letter was the same to all CPS offices.

I hope this helps,

Dear Chris

POL00292987

As well as my query about “hidden columns” on your COH spreadsheet — could you also urgently respond to my
questions below on all three different Horizon Update letters?

We urgently need to understand the origins and distribution of the version of the Horizon update letter which was the
pre-curser to the October letter and likewise for the October and then December update letters: I attach copies of all
three I have come across for ease of reference: obviously I know that Legal created the letters in October and
December, but we very urgently need from you a clear explanation of:

1. The date of creation and circulation of the attached “pre-curser” letter “LEA Disclosure Letter.docx”— when
was this letter first prepared and deployed by Security ? was this letter sent out to all CPS Area Offices in the
past? If so, when? Or was this letter used only on a case by case basis? If so, from what date onwards and do
you have copies/a record of in which cases it was provided to the CPS and/or the Police ?

2. The October update letter “Disclosure for CPS 21 October 19”: was this letter sent out to all CPS Area Offices
in October 2019 and/or was this letter only sent on a case by case basis to known ongoing cases? Can we have
copies and a record of in which cases it was provided to the CPS/Police and when from October onwards?

3. The December update letter “[Draft] Letter to Prosecutors — clean final copy.docx”: confirmation this letter
was indeed sent to all CPS Area Offices (including NI and Scotland) in December2019 and copies of those
letters; also confirmation, that this letter was also sent out to individual CPS/Police in known ongoing
prosecutions; and again copies of those individual letters as sent.

The priority is to have a better understanding of the scope to circulation of each of these letters please urgently, even if
getting the copies as sent together will take some time — can you please respond on this aspect ASAP by way of general
explanations to the above even if copy letters will follow along later?

Thanks

Ben

CoH Spreadsheet - legal privilege/confidential/do not share this email
legal privilege/confidential/do not share this email

Dear Chris

More urgent assistance required:

1. I recalled from the COH call last week that you said you had hidden a number of columns to make it easier to
read the sheet on a screen —is the attached COH schedule worked from the full version of your spreadsheet or
the “hidden” version? Can I please have the full version asap?

2. As requested below — please can you urgently clarify the precise recipients of the October and December 2019
CPS Update Letters from Security. Please start with the December letters if that’s easier.

Many thanks

Ben

It was mentioned in the meeting that any (Police) case that progresses through the legal process CPS / Court that your

Dear Christopher and Mark (D)
Urgent — your response required today. Please confirm receipt by return and that you can assist.

In Mark R’s absence, Rod needs your urgent assistance regarding your current COH spreadsheet as attached. Can you
between you please provide the following - please respond with (1) and (2) today:

1. From the spreadsheet can you list out (simply by reference to the number line on the spreadsheet and Branch
name):

e The cases where POL is now engaged with assisting the Police/HMRC/other investigators but, so far as you are
aware, the case has not yet been passed to the CPS for their consideration;

@ The cases where the CPS are engaged with the case already — whether still at an early stage or where the cases
are progressing in Court.

e Any others.

2. Can you identify which of your cases in the spreadsheet are next going to be heard in Court - whether some sort
of interim hearing or a trial date — and flag up anything imminent - looking over the list I can immediately see
there are trial dates for the following — but you should double check to include others with a trial date or other
hearing date :

2 March — Scotter Road (item 13)
25 March — Cabragh (item 18)

POL-BSFF-0131050_0003
POL00292987
POL00292987

@ 2November — Hanger Lane (item 21)

3. Please can you clarify in Column G of the spreadsheet — where it identifies “Legal Letter sent” in December or
some in January — was that letter sent both to (a) the CPS contact/Police in the case and/or (b) CPS area
office? Where there are entries in the spreadsheet where the letter was not sent, is the a general explanation of
why not?

4. Can you produce a list of where the December CPS update letter was sent and did Security retain copies of
them “as sent”?

5. Separately, you will recall a previous CPS update letter was prepared in October 2019 by Legal and instructions
given to Security on sending it out on 22 October — likewise, can you proiduce a list of where that October CPS
update letter was sent and did you retain copies of them “as sent”?

Please can you turn your attention urgently to (1) and (2) above and respond today and then pick up on (3) to (5) as
soon as possible.

Thanks

Ben
