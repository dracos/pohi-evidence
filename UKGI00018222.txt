93% of the total UK population (and 99% of those living in towns and cities) living
within one mile of a post office.

spectrum, carry out a critical economic function for many small firms, and often play
a significant social role in communities.

Over 170 different services are available over Post Office counters and all but one is.

Dori 2012/13 2013/14 2014/16

180m ‘e410m ‘e4t6m 330m

BIS also provides a £1.15bn working capital facility ~
effectively an overdraft faclity —to POL to fund the
‘cash in the network,

‘Amounts drawn under this facility enable POL to have
sufficient cash in its branches to meet demands for
benefits payments or business and personal banking
requirements with a high degree of certainty
Consequently “cash-ouls” at post offices are
extremely rare,

Government funding for POL — both the subsidy and
the loan - requires state aid approval. The 2011/12
funding has been approved and was paid on 1 April
2011. Itis imperative we receive approval for the
‘remaining funding before 1 April 2012.

@ Shareholder
Executive

+ The restructuring is proposed to coincide with the implementation of the pension
solution on 1 April 2012, subject to state aid clearance.

‘Anew 10-year distribution agreement between Royal Mail and POL, suitable for
completely separated businesses, has been agreed.

On 4 April 2012, POL staff will become formal POL employees (having previously been
secondees from Royal Mail) and new group governance arrangements will be put in
place.

We are developing proposals with the companies for the role and constitution of the
RMH Board once RMG and POL have moved to sister companies under the RMH
holding company at March 2012. Our intention is for RMG and POL to be devolved full
operational autonomy, with minimal powers at the RMH level.

We envisage that the businesses will remain in the same corporate and tax group, but
operationally separate, until the earlier of an RMG transaction or a POL mutualisation.

‘Anew Chair and senior non-executive director have recently been appointed to POL’s
Board. The Board will be further strengthened by appointment of new NEDs.

From 1 April 2012, we will ensure that we have direct Shareholder powers over POL
(these are currently exercised at RMH level). These will nclude approval rights over
Board appointments and remuneration.

‘The company is also deploying a People Engagement plan aimed to ensure that the
whole organisation (including agents) is aligned behind the entire strategic plan,
including separation. 10

* Mails: Contract negotiation with Royal Mail and POL’s abilly to harness growth in parcels are main drivers of static growth
forecast.

+ Financial services: The company is coming under greater pressure in the bill payments market with competitors such as
PayPoint. Forecast increase in 2012 reflects renegotiation of Bank of Ireland contract and macro-economic assumplions.

* Government and ID services: POL's network of AE! Kits makes them a good competitor to win key government services.
Contracts, particularly in identity verification. However this revenue is volatile a itis largely dependent on POL winning key
contracts with UKBA, IPS and DVLA.
