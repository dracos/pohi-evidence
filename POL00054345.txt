Subject: Summary of Calendar Square Falkirk Problem

Charles,

lve been asked about the issue at Callender Square, Falkirk (I'm not quite sure about the spelling) that came
up at the Castleton Trial

I thought I'd better keep you in the loop on this.
lve now dug back into the archives to provide the following summary:

1, The problem occurred when transferring Cash or Stock between Stock Units. Note that West Byfleet
does operate multiple Stock Units so the issue could have occurred.

2. it manifests itself by the Receiving Stock Unit not being able to “see” the Transfer made by the
“sending” Stock Unit and is compounded by attempting to make a further transfer. Note that such
transactions usually reappear the next day.

3 it is clearly visible to the User as a “Receipts and Payments mismatch’ at the time that one of the
Stock Units is Balanced. This usually results in the Branch raising a call. There are no such calls in Andy
Dunks’ Witness Statement which summarises the calls raised by West Byfleet. Also this can be checked
on any Balance Reports or Branch Trading Statements that are available from the Branch which should show
that Receipts and Payments do match and that the Trading Position is zero

4 The problem is also visible when looking at system events associated with the Branch. The System
events from 30/06/2005 to 31/12/2009 for West Byfleet have been checked and no such events have been
found.

5. The problem was fixed in the S90 Release which went live in March 2006 and so would not have been
relevant at the time of the detailed Transaction Logs obtained for West Byfleet between December 2006 and
December 2007

Therefore I can conclude that the problems identified in Calendar Square, Falkirk are not relevant to West
Byfleet.
