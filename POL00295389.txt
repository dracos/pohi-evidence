hold of you. She suggested your mobile. Would you be available this morning for a call

Who in POL had the idea to have a review into Horizon.Given my strong support for the integrity of the Horizon
system over 5 years ,I am disappointed that my views on this course of action were not sought,I am also

surprised that after leaving messages with POL no one has picked up the phone to talk through this contentious
decision.

Please can Alwen contact George as I'm out this pm, and make sure that we have a process for capturing
‘interest’ that comes in via the Fed.

George thank you for this. We will be completely open and transparent. I'd like to get this cleared up for
everyone.

Dear Sir/Madam

Ref; Thorney Post Office, 5 Abbey Place PE6 , Computer Systems failure.

http: //www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18535354

T have previously written to you regarding a computer errors not balancing correctly at the
end of each day and my 63 year old mother having to use her own money to balance the
system. After constant checking, as my mother use to work in a bank and has been a sub
post mistress for twelve years she is more than able to do this basic task, however, the
system still did not balance even when on paper it should. Because of this she has had to
use her own funds to balance the system or be accused of being incompetent or fraudulent.

After weeks of telephone conversations by my Mother with unhelpful staff from nameless
Post Office personal I contacted your organisation in order for your support and advice.

Your advice was close to useless your support was non existent and my Mother was just
insulted by a man stating the obvious over the telephone.

So please explain to me the link I attach below and why after several letters you did not
bring this to my attention?

I would like you to contact Mrs G Taylor at Thorney Post Office, 5 Abbey Place, Thorney
PE6 and apologise for your lack lustre performance and how you are going to support her
further as I thought is the whole point being a paid member of National Federation of Sub
Postmasters.

Yours sincerely

Paul Taylor
