Post Office Mediation Scheme Update

The Post Office today announced that it has completed its investigations into
complaints from 136 postmasters concerning the operation of the Post Office's
Horizon computer system.

Horizon has around 78,000 users and processes more than six million
transactions every day. None of the cases investigated have revealed any
problems caused by flaws in the system.

xx of the 136 cases have already been closed through mediation or other means.
The remaining xx cases will now go to mediation, except those which have been
the subject of earlier Court rulings.

The Post Office will consider its approach to cases with a Court ruling on an
individual basis, including through offering applicants the opportunity for a
discussion of their case with their Member of Parliament.

Angela van den Bogerd, Post Office Head of Partnerships, said:

“This has been an exhaustive process which has established that there are no
system-wide problems with our computer system and associated processes. We
will now look to resolve the final outstanding cases as quickly as possible."

The announcement means that the Working Group set up to assess whether
cases move forward for mediation will be wound up.

Angela van den Bogerd added: “We would like to thank everyone who played a
part in the Working Group for their valuable and important input.”
