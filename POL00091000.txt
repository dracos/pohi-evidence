Hi Chris

Sue Muddeman dealt with this case and has all the information regarding the case. The other thing that you
could obtain is details of the NBSC calls which were logged by the branch.

Regards
Karen

Karen,

I've been asked by our Lawyer if we know if Mrs Hall ever requested an audit at the branch?
