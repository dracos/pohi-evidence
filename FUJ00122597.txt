I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL Pathway Ltd
since DATE as an Information Technology (IT) Security Analyst responsible for audit data
extractions and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised
by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit archived data and to obtain information

regarding system transactions recorded on the Horizon system.

Horizon’s documented procedures stipulate how the Horizon System operates, and while I am
not involved with any of the technical aspects of the Horizon System, these documented

processes allow me to provide a general overview.

At each Post Office there are counter positions that have a computer terminal, a visual display
unit and a keyboard and printer. This individual system records all completed transactions input
by the counter clerk working at that counter position. Clerks log on to the system by using their
own unique password. The transactions performed by each clerk, and the associated cash
and stock level information, are recorded by the computer system in a stock unit. Once logged
on, all completed transactions performed by the clerk must be recorded and entered on the
computer and are accounted for within the user's allocated stock unit.

The Horizon system provides a number of daily and weekly records of all completed

transactions input into it. It enables Post Office users to obtain computer summaries for
individual clients of Post Office Limited e.g. Alliance & Leicester. The Horizon system also
enables the clerk to produce a periodic balance of cash and stock on hand combined with the

other transactions performed in that accounting period, known as a trading period.

Where local reports are required these are accessed from a button on the desktop menu. The
user is presented with a parameter driven menu, which enables the report to be customised to
requirements. The report is then populated from transaction data that is held in the local
database and is printed out on the printer. The system also allows for information to be
transferred to the main accounting department at Chesterfield

The Post Office counter processing functions are provided through a series of counter
applications: the Order Book Control Service (OBCS) that ascertained the validity of DWP
order books before payment was made, this application ceased in June 2005; the Electronic
Point of Sale Service (EPOSS) that enables Postmasters to conduct general retail trade at the
counter and sell products on behalf of their clients; the Automated Payments Service (APS)
which provides support for utility companies and others who provide incremental in and out
payment mechanisms based on the use of cards and other tokens and the Logistics Feeder
Service (LFS) which supports the management of cash and value stock movements to and
from the outlet, principally to minimise cash held overnight in outlets. The counter desktop
service and the office platform service on which it runs provides various common functions for
transaction recording and settlement as well as user access control and session management.

Information from counter transactions is written into a local database and then replicated
automatically to databases on all other counters within a Post Office outlet. The information is
then forwarded over ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)or other communication
service, to databases on a set of central Correspondence Servers at the Fujitsu Services data
centres. This is undertaken by a messaging transport system within the Transaction
Management Service (TMS). Various systems then transfer information to Central Servers that
control the flow of information to various support services. Details of outlet transactions are
normally sent at least daily via the system. Details are then forwarded daily via a file transfer

service to the Post Office accounting department at Chesterfield and also, where appropriate,
to other Post Office Clients.

An audit of all information handled by the TMS is taken daily by copying all new messages to
archive media. This creates a record of all completed outlet transaction details including its
origin - outlet and counter, when it happened, who caused it to happen and the outcome. The
TMS journal is maintained at each of the Fujitsu Services Data Centre sites and is created by
securely replicating all completed transaction records that occurred in every Outlet. They
therefore provide the ability to compare the audit track record of the same transaction recorded
in two places to verify that systems were operating correctly. Records of all transactions are
written to audit archive media.

The system clock incorporated into the desktop application on the counter visual display units
is configured to indicate local time. This has been the situation at (INSERT PO), Branch Code
(INSERT) since (INSTALLATION DATE) when the Horizon system was introduced at that
particular Post Office.

The Horizon system records time in GMT and takes no account of Civil Time Displacements,
thus during British Summer Time (BST) (generally the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday
in October), system record timings are shown in GMT — one hour earlier than local time (BST).

There was, however, one exception which related to the category of transactions ‘Transfer In’
where events recorded in the Transaction Logs, were shown in local time. This meant that
during the designated summer months ‘Transfer In’ log entries were recorded in BST instead
of GMT and showed a one hour forward displacement in time from other transactions being
recorded in the logs. This anomaly was corrected during the winter months prior to BST 2005
since when ‘Transfer In’ log entries have been recorded in GMT, consistent with all other

transactions being recorded in the logs. ~ Delete this for data post Oct 2004.

audit archive media via the Audit Workstations (AW’s). Information is presented in exactly the
same way as the data held in the archive although it can be filtered depending upon the type of
information requested. The integrity of data retrieved for audit purposes is guaranteed at all
times from the point of gathering, storage and retrieval to subsequent despatch to the
requester. Controls have been established that provide assurances to Post Office Internal
Audit (POIA) that this integrity is maintained.

During audit data extractions the following controls apply :

1. Extractions can only be made through the AWs which exist at Fujitsu Services,
Lovelace Lane, Bracknell, Berkshire and Fujitsu Services, Sackville House, Brooks
Close, Lewes, East Sussex. These sites are both subject to rigorous physical security
controls appropriate to each location. All AWs are located in a secure room subject to
proximity pass access within a secured Fujitsu Services site.

2. Logical access to the AW and its functionality is managed in accordance with the
Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account Security Policy and the principles of ISO 17799.
This includes dedicated Logins, password control and the use of Microsoft Windows NT
security features.

3. All extractions are logged on the AW and supported by documented Audit Record
Queries (ARQ’s), authorised by nominated persons within Post Office Ltd. This log can
be scrutinised on the AW.

Extractions are only made by authorised individuals.
Upon receipt of an ARQ from Post Office Ltd they are interpreted by CS Security. The
details are checked and the printed request filed.

6. The required files are identified and marked using the dedicated audit tools.

7. Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to audit
archive media and re-calculated when the files are retrieved.

8. To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the audit archive media the checksum
seal for the file is re-calculated by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the original
value calculated when the file was originally written to the audit archive media. The
result is maintained in a Check Seal Table.

(FOR DATA PROVIDED BETWEEN MAY 2007 AND NOV 2008, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING
PARAGRAPH)

In December 2007 an occurence was reported in one office where a Stock Unit roll-over
coincided with the End Of Day Process running. This led to a previously unseen database lock
in which an administrative balancing transaction failed to be written to the local messagestore
database. This generated a generic and non-specific software error Event which went
unnoticed in the monitoring of Events. A financial imbalance was evident and was subject to
investigation by Fujitsu's Service Support Centre (SSC) and Post Office Limited (POL). The
financial imbalance has been resolved.

A software correction was applied across the estate in early November 2008, to ensure that
any such Event generated would be monitored. Testing of that correction has established that

the unmonitored error does not occur elsewhere in the system.

There is no reason to believe that the information in this statement is inaccurate because of
the improper use of the system. To the best of my knowledge and belief at all material times
the system was operating properly, or if not, any respect in which it was not operating properly,
or was out of operation was not such as to effect the information held within it.

Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to the business of
Fujitsu Services. These were compiled during the ordinary course of business from
information supplied by persons who have, or may reasonably be supposed to have, personal
knowledge of the matter dealt with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any
recollection of the information or cannot be traced. As part of my duties, I have access to

these records.
