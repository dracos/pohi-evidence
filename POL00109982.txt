appreciated.

Jane MacLeod has written to you today confirming our decisions on Post Office’s approach
to mediation and the closure of the Working Group. You should also have received a copy
of our press notice and confirmation that other members of the Working Group were
informed of our decisions ahead our announcement.

lam writing separately to follow up some of the points we discussed last week. Firstly,
have reflected on your comments on our approach to applicants in the Scheme with a
conviction, In our announcement, we have confirmed will continue to look at each case
individually and consider their suitability for mediation or potentially a discussion with the
applicant.

{also want to confirm that the Scheme’s Secretariat will remain in place to complete the
actions agreed at the last Working Group, including outstanding correspondence, answer
enquiries from applicants and to work with CEDR to administer the timely mediation of
cases. The Secretariat has collated a list of actions that were outstanding at the time the
Working Group closed and proposals for dealing with them for your agreement. They will
send these through. In addition, they would be pleased to offer you any support you
require to complete any outstanding tasks or on any other issues that you feel are required
or appropriate. Please do let them know.
