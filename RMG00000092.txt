Subject: Highly Confidential - Query regarding Horizon trials
Hi Everyone

By way of introduction, I am lawyer in the Group Legal team.
We have been asked by Post Office to confirm if we hold any information or documents relating to previous
prosecutions of Sub-Postmasters that relied on evidence from its Horizon system. These prosecutions would have
taken place between the period from 2000 to 2012.
You have been identified as somebody who may be able to assist. Please can you answer the following 2 questions:
1. Did you work on any investigations of Sub-Postmasters involving the use of Horizon data?; and
2. Do you possess any material relating to prosecutions using Horizon data?

Can you please respond to james.e.jones@: relation to this as soon as possible.
You must retain the originals until you are advised ‘they are no longer required.

Many thanks for your assistance.

Kind regards

Luke Ryan
