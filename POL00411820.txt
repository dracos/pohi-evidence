Post Office’s Legal & Regulatory Framework E>
Scope

- Hundreds of pieces of legislation and regulation

- Vast web of laws, regulations, contracts, licences, & disputes

- Purpose:

Outline material and most frequently encountered legislation and regulation.

Who is accountable (ownership of the risk) and responsible (those who need to
comply or follow direction of the accountable owner) within POL.

Outline the basic controls that mitigate the risk and through which assurance
can be given that the risk is being appropriately managed.

Necessarily high level but Legal would be pleased to provide deep dives into
any topic.

Penalty of Non-Compliance

SoS can seek to enforce the obligation by obtaining an injunction in the High Court. Adverse publicity
and reputational damage likely.

Personal criminal liability for individuals with the maximum sentence for modern slavery / human
trafficking offences is life imprisonment.

IDD — indirect application

IDD applies to POMS but as a result of the MSA, ARA, and Distribution Agreement between POL and
POMS, there are implications for POL. IDD aims to enhance consumer protection and competition.

By 23 February 2018, insurance intermediaries must provide the exact amount of fees payable by the
customer, including the post contract fees a customer may incur during the life of a policy e.g
commissions. There is a new product information document which is to replace the current policy
summary. The insurance intermediary is responsible for distributing it and staff distributing products
must undertake minimum of 15 hours of CPD. POL is impacted by those distribut in branch e.g Travel,
Life.

Criminal Finances Act

CFA comes into force on 30 September 2017 and introduces a new corporate offence of failing to
prevent the facilitation of criminal UK or foreign tax evasion by an Associated Person. Associated
Persons include employees, postmasters/agents, suppliers, contractors and consultants. It is a defence
for the Post Office to show that it had reasonable procedures in place to prevent facilitation or that it
was not reasonable to expect it to have such procedures. The HMRC guidance makes it clear that the
Act is not intended to hold bodies to account for their customers or agents tax crimes but rather to
require them not to turn a blind eye where their associated persons deliberately assists others to evade
tax.

Penalty of Non-Compliance

* — Criminal corporate offence and potentially unlimited fine.
Accountable and Responsible

* Finance Crime Policy

« Law and Trends Forum identified this new Act and established a cross functional CFA working group to
implement the requirements of the Act and in particular establish a “reasonable procedures” defence to
the new corporate offence.

« New contractual obligations are imposed on postmasters, suppliers, contractors and further
communication is planned for employees.
