The PORA process is mandatory in any Post
Office led investigation which may involve a
planned, interview under caution or premises
search. A PORA is required for each suspect
involved in the investigation,

In order to manage the risks effectively
Investigators should conduct any risk related
intelligence checks and/or enquiries that they
feel are necessary as part of the PORA
process. The following checks are available
and thought to be the most relevant to Post
Office Security cases

Local Management check -. may also
identify other information such as health

issues, including suspected drug or alcohol
habits, or outside interests e.g. domestic
circumstances which may impact on H&S.

PNC Individual checks — may identify
“warning” indicators or previous convictions of
both suspects and others at the address. It
may also identify other information which
impacts on H&S such as any history regarding
the certification (or refusal) of firearms or
orders recalling persons to hospital.

Full Equifax check — this check can be used
to identify current occupants at an address to
be searched or visited. A “Full Investigation”
Equifax check should be undertaken

PNC Vehicle check — this can reveal
registered keepers of vehicles at a specific

POL00122560
POL00122560

address.

Land Registry checks — these will identify the
owner of property.

Local Police Intelligence check — may
identify risks regarding the suspect or other

incidents or persons at the address(es) and
the geographical area(s) to be visited. It may
also identify other law enforcement interest.

Risk Score

Where any risk is assessed as High a Senior
Investigation Manager should be consulted
and the assistance of the Police sought before
any investigation activities which bring
Investigators in to contact with the suspect are
commenced.

Where the Planned Operation is assessed as
Low or Medium risk line manager’s authority
must be obtained before any investigation
activities which bring Investigators into contact
