                       POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




          FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JOHN GERARD MCKENNY




I, John Gerard McKenny, will say as follows...


INTRODUCTION


   1. I am a former employee of Post Office Limited. I joined the business in June

       1980 and began work as a Delivery Postman, delivering mail in the Omagh

       County Tyrone locality where I was based. In May 1982, I applied for a

       position as a Postal Officer to serve customers on the Post Office Counter. I

       was successful and continued in that job for approximately eight years, again

       in Omagh County Tyrone. In 1990, (not sure of the exact date) I joined the

       Northern Ireland Internal Audit team, based again in Omagh but managed

       from a Regional Office in Belfast. I worked within that Audit Team for

       seventeen years conducting Accounts and Systems audits at Crown and

       Sub Post Offices throughout Northern Ireland.


   2. In 2007, (again not sure of the exact date) Post Office Limited set up a

       closure programme team where 2500 Sub Post offices were identified for


                                    Page 1 of 12
                                                                                      WI TN10440100
                                                                                  WI TN10440100




    closure or restructuring. I joined that team as a Network Change Advisor and

   we had to conduct surveys in the areas where the identified Post Offices

   were. We then drew up plans to maintain a Post Office service in the areas

    even though some were closing. We also had to visit the Offices and inform

    the Subpostmasters ('SPMs') of the Post Office plans. That was my last job

   with Post Office Limited and I left the business in January 2009.


3_ In all my time with the business and in the various roles that I had, I was

   never involved in any disciplinary matters or interviews in relation to criminal

   offences or proceedings. I was required to attend court as a witness a small

   number of times due to my findings at Audits. But as far as I remember the

   Post Office Investigations Team dealt with all the disciplinary matters and

    criminal proceedings.



BACKGROUND



4_ In all my time with the Northern Ireland Internal Audit Team as an Auditor,

   all my work and instructions were given to me by my managers within the

   Team. I conducted audits on my own and as part of a team of auditors

   depending on the size of the branches. We would have been advised on a

   Friday what the audit schedule was for the following week and we would

    prepare accordingly. I do not recall any changes to that way of working.



5. I do not recall ever seeing any of the following documents which I have been

    asked by the Inquiry: `Assurance Review â€” Recruitment (Vetting and


                                 Page 2 of 12

                                                                                  WI TN10440100




     Training)' [POL00032698], 'Network auditing approach, methods and

     assurance (2013)' [POL00086765], `Training and Audit Advisor'

     [POL00088453] and 'Audit Advisor' [POL00088557].



6. In respect of the recruitment of auditors, as far as I remember they were

     recruited internally and had worked on Branch Counters for a reasonable

     period of time.



7.   I never knew of any minimum level of qualification and/ or experience

     required when becoming an auditor. In my case, I had worked on a Post

     Office Branch Counter for eight years when I was approached by a Manager

     to join the Audit Team. I had gained quite a bit of experience of what was

     required when it came to Post Office Accounting.



8. As far as I remember, I "shadowed" experienced auditors for a period of

     time prior to leading an audit myself. Any refresher training would have been

     conducted during team meetings.



9. I think as auditors we had the necessary experience and tools to conduct

     audits at various types of Post Office Branches.



10. I've been asked by the Inquiry to consider the document called `Audit Plan &

     Scheduling, Chapter 1 of the Audit Process Manual' [POL00084650]. I do

     not recall ever seeing this document.



                                  Page 3 of 12
                                                                                  WI TN10440100
                                                                                WI TN10440100




11. I was never involved when it came to scheduling Post Office Audits.

12. I have no idea how promptly audits were completed after scheduling.



13. When I was preparing for an audit of a branch, I would have examined the

    previous audit paperwork and any report that was completed.



14. I do not know how frequently branches were audited.



15. Again, I was not involved in any scheduling of audits of any kind.



16. I have been asked by the Inquiry to consider the following documents:


       i.   "Audit Charter" (version 4.0, undated) [POL00083966];

      ii.   "Performing a Branch Audit", Chapter 3 of the Audit Process Manual

            (version 5.1, May 2010) [POL00084801];

     iii.   "Core & Outreach Audit Process", Chapter 3a of the Audit Process

            Manual (version 1.0, 27 May 2011) [POL00085534];

     iv.    "Follow Up Audit Process", Chapter 3b of the Audit Process Manual

            (version 3.0, May 2015) [POL00087627];

      v.    "Performing a Cash Centre Audit", Chapter 7 of the Audit Process

            Manual (version 5.0, Aug 2016) [POL00088252];

     vi.    "Quality Assurance", Chapter 11 of the Audit Process Manual

            (version 5.0, Apr 2015) [POL00087672];

     vii.   "Post Incident Auditing without Horizon", Chapter 14 of the Audit

            Process Manual (version 1.0, Nov 2006) [POL00084003];


                                 Page 4 of 12
                                                                                    WI TN10440100
                                                                                  WI TN10440100




    viii.   "Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance" (version 2, Oct 2008)

            [POL00084813];

     ix.    "Requirement of Network Field Support Advisors at audit, following

            discovery of discrepancy" (version 1.0, Oct 2011) [POL00085652];

      x.    "Network auditing approach, methods and assurance" (2013)

            [POL00086765];

     xi.    "Training Guide: Compliance Audit Tool" (Sep 2015)

            [POL00087688];

     xii.   "Training-Aide for Branch Asset Checking" (version 1.7, Nov 2014)

            [POL00087716];

    xiii.   "Terms of Reference Audits" (version 1, April 2015) [POL00087614].


   I do not recall seeing any of the aforementioned documents during my time

   as an auditor.



17. With regard to sources of information, the remittances of cash and stock in

   and out of the branch for the week previous to the audit visit and the current

   week were always verified with the Cash Centres. There was no variance,

   that was completed at every audit.



18. Again, as far as I remember, when a discrepancy or shortfall was

   discovered at an audit and when all necessary checks were completed, I

   would have contacted my Line Manager, who in turn would have contacted

   the Area Manager responsible for the Branch. I would then have awaited

   further instructions.

                                                                                   WI TN10440100




19. If my memory serves me right, we would have asked the SPM if they could

    make good any discrepancy which wouldn't have been considered too large.

   I cannot remember what the limits on discrepancies were prior to calling in

    Management. However, I do not recall any practice as such for making good

    discrepancies.



20. I was not aware of any instructions on taking payment.



21. If my memory serves me right, all enquiry avenues would have been

    considered, including input from the SPM.



22. I think I always kept the SPM fully informed on how the audit was

    progressing and made sure that they or a member of their staff were

    present, especially when the value stock and cash were being audited.



23. I do not recall any processes in place that allowed the SPM to raise issues

    or concerns during an audit.



24. I don't think it would have been possible to conduct an audit at a branch if

    the Horizon IT system was not accessible.



25. I do not recall any variation between audit processes in Crown Office

    Branches and others.

26. I have been asked by the Inquiry to consider FUJ00001894 and

   POL00002841. I do not recall ever seeing either of these two documents.



27. I do not recall Fujitsu having any involvement in the audit process.



28. I do not remember having any access to information that wasn't available to

    a SPM.



29. I have never heard of an Audit Global User Account in my life. I do not know

    what Audit Global User Accounts are.



30. I have been asked to consider POL00104821. I do not recall ever seeing

    this document. My only recollection of investigators attending an audit would

    have been when the audit was requested by their team, and they would

    have attended and waited for the result of the audit checks.



31. My only involvement with the Security and Investigation Team would have

    been when they requested an audit of a particular branch, and they

    accompanied us at the audit.

33. My recollection and involvement in the prosecution of Maureen McKelvey is

   as follows-:



34. The Security and Investigation Team requested an audit of Maureen

   McKelvey's branch in April 2002. Back then, Pension and Allowances were

   paid to Post Office customers via "Dockets" which were issued to them by

   Social Security, Pensions Branch and other Government Departments. On

   cashment of these Dockets, the Subpostmaster would have to input the

   docket amounts into the Horizon System, pay the customer accordingly, and

   then retain the paid dockets in their till. At the end of an accounting week

   (usually a Wednesday), these Dockets would have to be "addlisted", verified

   with the Horizon System, and of course included in the office balance.

   These addlisted Dockets would then be dispatched to Lisahally in County

   Londonderry.



35. Lisahally was a centre where all paid Pension and Allowance Dockets from

   throughout the United Kingdom were sent. At this centre staff undertook

   periodical checks of the paid Dockets, and it seems that a check of Maureen

   McKelvey's Dockets revealed discrepancies, which in turn would have been

   reported to the Security and Investigation Team.


36. As part of the Security and Investigation Team's work, they would have

   requested the audit of Maureen McKelvey's branch which was conducted on

   4 April 2002. I was instructed to undertake the audit and I was accompanied

   by Suzanne Winter of the Security and Investigation Team. On completion
