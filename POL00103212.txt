Subject: Chairman's review
Tim

As flagged at the Board earlier this week, I hosted a call with Jonathan swift Qc today to ask what, in
his view, would be a reasonable course of action for you to take in relation to his recommendations as to
the further lines of enquiry which could be undertaken, now that POL faces litigation covering
essentially the same ground.

In summary, Jonathan felt that Tony Robertson Qc (the barrister retained to advise POL on its defence to
the proceedings) should first be requested to advise POL whether in light of the litigation, the various
works teams should be continued, paused or re-defined.

We will send instructions to Tony early next week and expect to have this advice relatively quickly.

Once this advice has been received, Jonathan has said that he would be happy to discuss with you how
best to take this forward in the context of your review, as well as considering how to position this with
BNR, and others with knowledge of and interest in the Review.

I will_let you know as soon as we have Tony Robinson's advice. As ever, please give me a call if you
would like to discuss.

Kind regards,

Jane
