Subject: Counsel's Opinion [8H-4A FIDI6896945T

Attachments: Summary of Counsel's Opinion.pdf; Common Issues Opinion.pdf

All
Please find attached Counsel's Opinion. This reflects the combined views of Tony, David, Owain and Gideon.

I have prepared the attached short summary of the Opinion. This summary is however a gross over-simplification of the
issues and so I would strongly recommend not circulating this summary outside of this group. It is a useful crib sheet for
us, but it should not be relied on by Post Office.

Kind regards
Andy
