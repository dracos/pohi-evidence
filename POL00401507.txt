t happened e performan

Overall NCR system performance
continues to be stable.

Overall Kiosk Service Availability
continues to exceed 98% target,
however dropped to 98.4% in June
following the SSK card payment P1.

Number of branches with 50% kiosks
unavailable spiked wic 6" and 28"
June due to initial problems with
Contactless upgrade and card
payment P1 respectively.

Low levels resumed in July.

Contactless upgrade Programme —
Non conformance has been
eradicated whereby engineer was
replacing pinpads as opposed to a
remote upgrade

SSK rebuild backlog has been
addressed following the card payment
P1 whereby (no remote software
upgrades were possible)

NCR have been provided with access
to real time monitoring of the
NCR/Fujitsu circuit

Service levels are much improved
with low volume kiosk outages.

Average resolution time for an SSK
has been 8 hours (March-May). This
increased to 13 hours in June due to
a) incorrect replacement of pinpads
instead of remote software upgrade
and b) new device build backlog both
a consequence of the P1 incident

POL00401507

Overall 3M Cogent system
performance is very stable.

89% device incidents were resolved
within the 6 hour target.

However the 6 and 10 hour targets
of 95% and 100% respectively
remain unachievable.

Student Surge planning includes

New AE! Desktop PC is tested

Pilot commences July 1 with 13

The new device is to be rolled out to
prioritised UKVI sites between
during August and September prior
to Student Surge in October 2016

What is service performance doing now

?

+ 3M Cogent Right First Time has
significantly improved in Q3 2015-16.
This is due to the improved
competency and quality of the new

Problem Management

All branches unable to perform AEI
transactions

Issue

+ On the 10/06/16 all branches with AEI kiosks
were unable to complete AEI transactions
including DVLA driving license, UKVI and Security
Industry Authority (SIA). The kiosks were
reporting an out of service error and the branch
devices used to process the transactions were not
loading any software.

Root Cause

+ 3M investigated and identified that a new type of
certificate was introduced to AEI in November.
This certificate had expired and consequently the
front-end devices in branches could not
communicate with the 3M Central Segment.

Fix

. To restore service 3M in agreement with Post
Office rolled back to a previous software version
prior to the introduction of the expired certificate
(4.4.2), however this was the incorrect version
and introduced an issue which could have
prevented DVLA transactions from working. 3M
sourced a fix and the estate was reconfigured on

4.4.21 following successful testing.

GETS
The RCA for the incident has been published to
POL. 3M have identified a number of actions as a
result, these will focus on exactly why the
certificate expired in the first instance and
Prevention of future occurrences. These actions
will be progressed under Problem Record
P9148716.

je branches reporting
Horizon counters going offline

Issue

+ During the afternoon of 09/06/2016 1500
branches were unable to trade for a period of
4 - 10 minutes due to a Network router
failure. The impacted branches automatically
connected to an alternative resilient router
within minutes.

Root Cause

+ Failure of the LNS router
The device suffered a software crash.
Analysis has identified no abnormal errors or
hardware faults. The resilience design is that
the sessions connect via alternative devices.
This device has a history of being reliable and
will be operated and checked for a period
before sessions are reintroduced.

+ Dropped Broadband sessions on LNS
router
As a result of the initial LNS crash and the
below configuration error sessions were
imperfectly load balanced so the network
needed to redistribute the load. This process.
causes a brief interruption to the affected
branches.

+ Authentication issues
A route authentication error affecting a third
LINS caused it not to have a resilient
authentication path following the initial LNS
crash. The error was corrected.

Fix

+ Resilient backup took over service. Router
was removed and tested extensively prior to
re-introduction.

Status
+ RCA Published and actions completed.

MoneyGram Service Timeouts

Issue

+ Latency seen within the MoneyGram network
continues to result in end users in branch
raising incidents to the Atos Service Desk. At
periods of high latency within the
MoneyGram domain transactions timeout
resulting in a 1204 error code being
displayed on the Horizon counter.

Root Cause

+ MoneyGram made a number of changes.
within their domain which increased the time
taken for a transaction to complete. They
have since tried to improve the efficiency of
their network to limit the impact at times of
high bandwidth utilization.

Investigations continue to identify where in
the transaction journey the 1204 error code
is generated.

Fix

+ MoneyGram have implemented a number of
solutions in order to balance the traffic across.
their networks to reduce timeouts. Long-term
fixes include an infrastructure upgrade and
will be put in place during the upcoming
months.

Cet
A conference call was held on 28/06/2016
with Fujitsu, Accenture, bony and POL
present. Investigations continue and a
further conference call has been scheduled to

take place 12/07/2016.
