5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This section lists the identifier of each Acceptance Criterion that will be
demonstrated by the Acceptance Test. It also lists the Acceptance Test
Conditions that are used to determine whether (or not) the Acceptance Criterion
has been met together with the applicable test Phase, Technical Test, or Live
Trial.

Acceptance Criteria are split into three sets of tables according to the nature of
the acceptance method, one set for those tested by Acceptance Trial, a second
for those tested by Acceptance Review and a third which lists those criteria which
are for Acceptance at a later release. The Release on which Acceptance is to be
conducted is defined by reference to the Release Contents Description included
in the Associated Documents section of the Acceptance Specification.
Exceptionally, it may be necessary for one particular Acceptance Criterion to be
tested by a combination of trial and review in which case there are entries for
Trial and Review.

5.1 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND TEST CONDITIONS

Conformance of the EPOSS Acceptance Criteria will be demonstrated through
Acceptance Trials and/or Acceptance Reviews.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Trials comprise practical tests using prepared
test scripts. If applicable the Test Condition(s) appropriate to a criterion are
specified in section 5.1.1 together with a description of the test. Detailed
composition of the test in terms of sequences of Test Conditions is contained in
Section 10. In the tables in section 5.1.1 the rows labelled Function Run Entry
will be populated immediately prior to the running of the Acceptance Trials ina
working version of the Acceptance Specification. These will provide invigilators
with references to the checklists used to monitor the progress of the testing. The
order of running of Test Conditions will not necessarily correspond to the order
presented in HLTPs because of the “physicalisation” of the testing. The Function
Run Entry will allow the invigilator to read across from the criterion to the
checklist.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Review comprise typically document reviews,
site visits or presentations. If applicable the Test Condition(s) are described in

Criterion 56
Derivation Requirement

Criterion Description

EPOSS shall allow a User or group of Users to be
accountable for a Stock Unit, so that each Outlet has at
least one Stock Unit, but there can be other Stock Units,
effectively operating independently. Each Stock Unit can
in turn be tied to both a User or group of Users or a single
Till or group of Tills.

Thread Scenario

Note: definition of a Till:
A part or whole of a Stock Unit depending upon
whether or not that Stock Unit is the sole charge of
one individual or is shared between several.

The system supports the concept of multiple stock units
capable of independent operation. The creation of stock
units, attachment of users to them and reporting on the
balance within them is exercised repeatedly throughout
the test threads. Users can only do transactions against
the stock unit to which they are allocated. Every
Transaction is recorded against User, Stock Unit and
Node.

Criterion 2
Derivation Requirement

Criterion Description

When a price changes for a fixed price Value Stock Stock
Item, the Stock value must change to maintain the
relationship Stock value = Stock quantity x price. The
change in Stock value must be "balanced" by one or more
Transactions for designated POCL Products (and thence
reported on designated Cash Account lines). Thus the
requirement for maintaining an equal and opposite effect
on the Stock Unit is maintained

HLTP / Business
Thread Scenario

The EPOSS functionality can be seen by performing a
revaluation and subsequently printing a Cash Account.

performing functions appropriate to his role (as defined in (29)). He creates a
“Manager level user” Manager 1 for the outlet.

Manager 1 logs on to the system for the first time and is forced to amend his
initial password. He is attached to the Default Stock Unit.

Manager 1 creates Stock Unit 1.

Manager 1 changes his attachment from the Default Stock Unit to Stock Unit
1. He is restricted to performing functions appropriate to his role (as defined in
(29)) and functions allowable only on the default stock unit.

Manager 1 adds other users with different access role types to the system, viz
Supervisor 1 and Clerk 1. He attaches the users to Stock Unit 1.

Supervisor 1 logs on to the system for the first time and is forced to amend
his initial password. He is restricted to performing functions appropriate to his
role (as defined in (29)).

Clerk 1 logs on to the system for the first time and is forced to amend his
initial password. He is restricted to performing functions appropriate to his role
(as defined in (29)).

Support Engineer 1 uses the default “Engineer User” to gain access to the
system. Whilst logging on to the system, he verbally authenticates himself to
the Horizon System Help Desk with an encrypted key generated by the
system. The Help Desk then notifies him verbally of a one-shot key which
allows him entry to the system when keyed in. He is restricted to performing
functions appropriate to his role (as defined in (29)). After logging out he can
no longer gain access to the system.

Migration User 1 uses the default “Migration User” to gain access to the
system. Whilst logging on to the system, he verbally authenticates himself to
the Horizon System Help Desk with an encrypted key generated by the
system. The Help Desk then notifies him verbally of a one-shot key which
allows him entry to the system when keyed in. He is restricted to performing

@ Emergency Manager 1 uses the default “Emergency Manager User” to gain
access to the system. Whilst logging on to the system, he verbally
authenticates himself to the Horizon System Help Desk with an encrypted key
generated by the system. The Help Desk then notifies him verbally of a one-
shot key which allows him entry to the system when keyed in. He is restricted
to performing functions appropriate to his role (as defined in (29)). After
logging out he can no longer gain access to the system.

e Manager 1 forgets his password. He uses the default “Support User” to gain
access to the system to change his password to a new value. Whilst logging
on as Support User 2 to the system, he verbally authenticates himself to the
Horizon System Help Desk with an encrypted key generated by the system.
The Help Desk then notifies him verbally of a one-shot key which allows him
entry to the system when keyed in. After logging out he can no longer gain
access to the system as Support User 2, but is able to log on as Manager 1
again using his new password.

e Supervisor 1’s system held details require amendment. Manager 1 changes
the details.

Supervisor 1 forgets his password. Manager 1 changes his old password to a
new value. When the supervisor logs on again he is prompted for the new
password which allows him entry to the system.

e Supervisor 1 logs on to the system after the system pre-determined time
when a user is required to change his password. He is forced to amend his
password before being allowed entry to the system.

e Supervisor 1 wishes to change his own password to the system. He uses the
administration facility to do so. When he next logs on he is prompted for the
new password which allows him entry to the system.

e Supervisor 1 is to be stopped from using the system. Manager 1 amends the
user to disable him so that he is unable to log on to the system.

@ Supervisor 1 who is disabled from using the system is to be allowed to use the
system again. Manager 1 amends the user to enable him to do so, and he is
able to log on again.

e Supervisor 1 attempts to log on to the system with an invalid password a
number of times in succession until the system-imposed limit is reached. He
becomes locked out of the system so Manager 1 has to unlock him. He is
then able to log on again using his correct password.

e Another stock unit is required. Manager 1 creates Stock Unit 2.

e Clerk 1 is to be given supervisor responsibilities. Manager 1 amends his
access role to give him the required authority, and changes his attachment
from Stock Unit 1 to Stock Unit 2. When Clerk 1 next logs on he has access
to supervisor functions

e Auditor 1 gains access to the system again using the one-shot key procedure
and produces an Event Log of events that have occurred during the day.

e@ Supervisor 1 and Clerk 1 no longer work in the outlet. Manager 1 attaches
them to the Default Stock Unit and deletes them from the system.

e Stock Unit 2 is no longer required in the outlet. Manager 1 deletes it from the

(b)

This case involves partial Batch reconciliation, with
completion later the same day.

During the production life of the batch all normal
acceptance and delivery status values are received from
Royal Mail Track and Trace.

The batch contains cards for 10 customers.

The batch reconciliation is commenced as a “non-urgent”
batch. After scanning of the first 5 cards, the reconciliation
is halted to allow the clerk to serve a customer. (Helpdesk
is used at this stage to confirm that the batch status is
“received”. Reconciliation is recommenced later - the clerk
first initiates the “Report” function which lists the batch
and associated cards with status as appropriate (i.e.
“received” and “in transit”).

The reconciliation is completed for all of the remaining
cards, and a report produced.

A customer receives a PUN which is chewed up by the
dog. The customer contacts the Helpdesk to arrange for
an exceptional PUN to be delivered immediately. This
PUN is taken to the NPO and the card is collected. Whilst
attempting to collect a payment that is due the customer
changes his mind and leaves the office. The transaction is
voided.

Description transactions are conducted for a range of payee types (including encashments

by beneficiary, appointee, alternative payee, permanent agent and by a casual
agent). These encashments include several with milk tokens as well as
encashments for which the office is the NPO, FPO and specified office for use
with a temporary token. At least one card and token are keyed manually and
one additional encashment transaction voided. The encashments include an
attempted collection which results in a nil receipt being produced.

For one of the encashments completed the customer comes back to the post
office and requests to return the money collected and for the transaction to be
voided. An attempted reversal of the BES transaction is attempted but can not
be completed.

An encashment summary report is produced at the end of the week, which
identifies the receipts/AtPs required for despatch and indicates the EPOSS
transaction identifier for each encashment. Transactions are forwarded to PAS
and TPS. The transaction details generated for transfer to CAPS and to TIP are
checked for consistency of transaction identifiers with the local encashment
summary report and for consistency of encashment details with the original
transactions. The nil receipt transaction that was completed is included in the
TIP output and the EPOSS transaction log.

Payment on EPOSS, probably just debit cards initially
(e.g. Switch, Connect) but perhaps extending to credit
cards later, (e.g. Visa and Mastercard). The capability to
handle both debit and credit cards from commencement of
Roll Out of such a facility;

5. indicative volumes for end of Roll Out of EFTPOS are:
between 30 and 50 million EFTPOS payments per annum;
70% above the floor limit (£15 working assumption) and so
needing authorisation;

6. the main Transactions for which EFTPOS will be used
are expected to be:

motor vehicle licence renewals (34%), bill payments (38%,
about half BT and half others);

television licence payments (11%) and payment for
purchases from PostShops (5%), all estimates;

other likely Transactions leading to EFTPOS are expected
to include travel insurance and bureau de change and
cash withdrawals;

there would be no Cash-Back option initially;

7. business arrangements have not yet been finalised but
the current assumptions are for:

a single Merchant Acquirer;

on-line authorisation and batch Transaction submission to
be via TMS;

reconciliation of EFTPOS payments on the EROSS
Transaction log with an electronic data stream version of
the daily bank account updates;

signed receipts may be stored in the Outlets, remitted to
Distribution Centres or dispatched to a central facility
(which the CONTRACTOR may wish to offer);

POCL expects to need to retrieve receipts in order to
prove Transactions at 0.2% or between 60,000 and
100,000 per annum at above volumes.

options for EFTPOS on the particular facilities being

amendment], as POCL have decided that they do not
require such a facility to be implemented. All Reference
data will be centrally maintained.

A Report shall be available in each Outlet that maps
Reference Data of POCL Products to the appropriate
line(s) of the Cash Account table(s).

Reason Not at release 2

Requirement Id 819

Criterion 4

Derivation Requirement

Criterion Description

Under certain authorised circumstances an authorised
Outlet may produce one Cash Account to span a 2 or 3
week period and this must be managed by EPOSS. Within
this variation there is a requirement to correctly associate
the week number with a specific Transaction according to
a Client's requirements. This is one of either:

a) the week in which the Transaction took place or;

b) the final week in which the Cash Account is produced.

Reason

(a) above is deferred: EPOSS permits CAPs up to 3 weeks
long. The agreed POCL process is that before starting a 2
or 3 week CAP the EPOSS extended CAP process is used
to roll the office directly into the final week of the extended
CAP. (b) above is therefore met by the normal reporting
process. (a) above can be met, as all transactions are
time/date stamped by the system, and the POCL calendar
is known to the system. Reports could therefore be written
to report client transactions against calendar CAP. This
will not be provided at NR2.

Requirement Id 819
Criterion 5
Derivation Requirement

Criterion Description

EPOSS shall support the production of the Cash Account

Accounts shall include a 2D bar code.

6. ACCEPTANCE INCIDENT SEVERITY

This section identifies the guidelines to be applied during the analysis of
Acceptance Incidents, in order to establish the severity of such Acceptance
Incidents.

6.1 HIGH SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a substantive impact
on the service received by the Customer, e.g. failure to pay benefits to the right
person, at the right place, at the right time.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a major impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where
there was a major impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES
necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. failure to support
accurate POCL accounting

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the
service where there is no acceptable procedural workaround.

Consistent failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels,
e.g. where particular transactions do not meet the minimum Acceptable
Threshold under normal loading.

6.2 MEDIUM SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is visible to the Customer and is
likely to give rise to an adverse public perception of the service, but does not
substantively impact the service received by the Customer, e.g. incorrect spelling
on a receipt.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a medium impact on

ICL Pathway EPOSS Ref... CR/ACS/008

if; H Version: 4.0
Acceptance Specification Date. 18/12/98

the ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or
where there was a medium impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or
AUTHORITIES necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-
production of a weekly report, resulting in its manual transcription, which causes
additional resource or effort at every outlet of the average duration of one hour
per week per outlet.

Occasional failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels,
e.g. at peak loading, some transactions fail to meet Minimum Acceptable
Thresholds, but on average all transactions within the service do achieve
Minimum Acceptable Thresholds.

6.3 LOW SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion that is neither visible to nor has
substantive impact on the service received by the Customer e.g. presentational,
style and other cosmetic faults that are only visible to the user.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a minor impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where
there was a minor impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES
necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-production of a
weekly report, resulting in its manual transcription, which causes additional
resource or effort at ten or fewer outlets of the average duration of one hour per
week per outlet.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the
service but where the workaround is as secure as the original solution (i.e. the
only impact on risk is in ensuring that the workaround is performed, but where
procedures have been agreed and are in place).

7. TEST DATA

Test data including any operator entered scripts that are required to run the
Acceptance Test are defined below.
