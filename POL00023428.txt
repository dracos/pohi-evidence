dane, Rob

FYI below. FJ have finally got in touch about the LOR (Rob — if you prompted this ~ thank you!)

Despite Deioitte’s recent findings, you'll see that FU are still saying that FU cannot change transaction data (highlighted
below). There is clearly a disconnect in understanding between the parties but unfortunately we will not be able to resoive
this before tomorrow.

What we really need FJ to do is sign off on the other parts of the LOR (eg. the wording about the historic bugs). We don't
want the Remote Access point derailing the rest of the letter.

Let's discuss on our call and then I can speak to Mike

Kind regards

We have a hard deadline (set by Court rules) of sending our Letter to the other side in the litigation by 4pm.
tomorrow. Any changes to the letter need approval by POL and so we need Fu's input by close today at the absolute
latest.

I'm around ail day so please call whenever good for you.

Kind regards

Andy,

Apologies for the delay, unfortunately with holidays and a number of other things happening at once this one has
proven to be a struggle to get the right people to review in a timely manner. I will call you this afternoon after I have a
call with the team to get an update. We will provide you some interim views but our legal team have asked to get
involved given some of the inferences made in the document about Fujitsu and so please let me know what the absolute
deadline is and why this is key.

The primary issue we have at the moment is that we don’t believe the key element regarding the sanctity of the Core
Audit Process comes through in your proposed response and this remains the cornerstone of our inputs to date and the
presentations we’ve done on this point in the past to Post Office and Bond Dickinson. To say that Post Office has never
said the system is “error free” whilst correct fails to make the point that the system is built on the expectation that the
overarching system could have errors over time but the Core Audit Process captures every submitted “basket”
accurately and without error and cannot subsequently be changed but only added to {ail such additions include details
as to what created the addition etc. to create a full audit log). Numerous audits have proved this and it is the Core Audit
Process that forms the basis of the first level of analysis with respect to any suspect fraud or loss and hence why we
believe that Horizon is robust.

Kind regards,

Mike

I should be grateful if you could confirm that the review below is underway and that you're on course for a response by
tomorrow.

Please could you also review the attached very short document, which addresses a very specific point around Post
Office's / Fujitsu's capability to change branch data (this overlaps with Deloitte's work).

Apologies for the short notice but please could you again come back with any comments by close tommorrow.

Kind regards

Further to below, please find attached relevant extracts in relation to Horizon from our draft Letter of Response.

I should be grateful if you (or someone suitably placed at Fujitsu) could review the attached and flag / amend any points
that you consider to be incorrect. If possible, please could you provide your feedback by the end of this

week. Amendments by way of track changes would be perfect.

I've also attached relevant extracts from the Letter of Claim for context (no need to comment on these but feel free to do
so if appropriate).

Please keep circulation of our draft Letter within Fujitsu to the absolute minimum necessary to undertake the above
task. This document has been prepared for litigation purposes and shouid it be circulated for any other purpose within
Fujitsu, then legai privilege over the docurnent may be lost.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

Andy Parsons (cc’ed) is the partner at Bond Dickinson leading our defence of the Group Litigation. The Bond Dickinson

Freeths, and I have asked Andy to contact you directly to get Fujitsu's input on the sections of the response which
concern the services Fujitsu supplies to Post Office.

Andy ~ can you please drop Mike a line or give him acalll. GRO 2 get this moving.

With thanks for your continued cooperation, Rodric

Mike — I hope this finds you well.

I’ve just left a fairly long voicemail with you (apologies!), but Id be grateful if you could please give me a call when you
get a moment so I can give you an update on where we have got to in the Group Litigation, our next steps, and the input
we'd like from Fujitsu to help us advance our position.

The best number is my mobile —

With thanks and kind regards, Rodric

Subject: Horizon Group Litigation Update - Subject to Privilege

Mike,

Just to let you know that earlier this week we received a letter from Freeths LLP (a firm of solicitors) advising that on 11
April 2016 they issued a Claim Form against Post Office in the High Court on behalf of some 91 claimants. They have not
as yet served the Claim Form or any Particulars of Claim on us, and did not send a Pre-Action Letter of Claim before
issuing, so we remain unsighted on the basis of the claim or who has brought it.

So we’re not really that much further forward, although Freeths did say they intend to send us a Letter of Claim by 26
April 2016 (which I’m sure you'll appreciate is rather putting the horse after the cart...).

Apologies for not being in touch sooner — I had intended to give you the courtesy of a call much sooner, but
unfortunately kept running out of time. I am in the office all week next week so will try to give you a call then (one of
the things we will need to discuss is document preservation), but please feel free give me a call any time.

Kind regards, Rodric
