Hello all

With thanks to Tom for his comments on my draft and, in particular, for the background information, here is some
briefing for Paula’s meeting with JA which I hope will take the trick. It seeks to cover all eventualities in terms of her
disposition on the day and the hostility or otherwise of the meeting — critically, however, it does represent an attempt
to try to regain some initiative.

All comments welcome, of course, and I can make the necessary changes/have discussions during the course of
tomorrow and early Monday.

Best wishes
