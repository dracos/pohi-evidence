Every certificate shall be sealed with the seal and shall specify the number, class and 1
distinguishing numbers (if any) of the shares to which it relates and the amount or

respective amounts paid up thereon. The company shall not be bound to issue more

certificate to one joint holder shall be a sufficient delivery to all of them.

16. REPLACEMENT OF SHARE CERTIFICATES

share shall extend to any amount payable in respect of it.

18. ENFORCING LIEN BY SALE

The company may sell in such manner as the board may determine any shares on
which the company has a lien if a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently
payable and is not paid within fourteen clear days after notice has been given to the
holder of the share or to the person entitled to it in consequence of the death or
bankruptcy of the holder, demanding payment and stating that if the notice is not
complied with the shares may be sold. To give effect to a sale, the board may authorise
some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares sold to, or in
accordance with the directions of, the purchaser. The title of the transferee to the shares

so much of the sum for which the lien exists as is presently payable, and any residue
shall (upon surrender to the company for cancellation of the certificate for the shares
sold and subject to a like lien for any moneys not presently payable as existed upon the
shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the
sale.

required by the notice the amount called on his shares. A call may be required to be
paid by instalments. A call may be revoked in whole or part and payment of a call may
be postponed in whole or part as the board may decide. A person upon whom a call is
made shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent
transfer of the shares in respect whereof the call was made. A call shall be deemed to
have been made at the time when the resolution of the board authorising the call was
passed.

LIABILITY OF JOINT HOLDERS

The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect
thereof.

INTEREST DUE ON NON-PAYMENT

If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the person from whom it is
due and payable shall pay interest on the amount unpaid from the day it became due
and payable until it is paid at the rate fixed by the terms of allotment of the share or in
the notice of the call or, if no rate is fixed, at the appropriate rate (as defined by the Act)
but the board may waive payment of the interest wholly or in part.

SUMS DUE ON ALLOTMENT TREATED AS CALLS

An amount payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date, whether in
respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a call, shall be deemed to
be a call and if it is not paid the provisions of the articles shall apply as if that amount
had become due and payable by virtue of a call.

shall name the place where payment is to be made and shall state that if the notice is
not complied with the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be
forfeited.

FORFEITURE FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH NOTICE

If the notice is not complied with any share in respect of which it was given may, before
the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the
board and the forfeiture shall include all dividends or other moneys payable in respect of
the forfeited shares and not paid before the forfeiture.

SALE OF FORFEITED SHARES

Subject to the provisions of the Act, a forfeited share may be sold, re-allotted or
otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the board determines.
either to the person who was before the forfeiture the holder or to any other person and
at any time before sale, re- allotment or other disposition, the forfeiture may be
cancelled on such terms as the board thinks fit. Where for the purposes of its disposal a
forfeited share is to be transferred to any person the board may authorise some person
to execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person.

ARREARS TO BE PAID NOTWITHSTANDING FORFEITURE

Aperson any of whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in
respect of them and shall surrender to the company for cancellation the certificate for
the shares forfeited but shall remain liable to the company for all moneys which at the
date of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the company in respect of those
shares with interest at the rate at which interest was payable on those moneys before
the forfeiture or, if no interest was so payable, at the appropriate rate (as defined in the
Act) from the date of forfeiture until payment but the board may waive payment wholly

specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all

execution of an instrument of transfer if necessary) constitute a good title to the share
and the person to whom the share is disposed of shall not be bound to see to the
application of the consideration, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any
irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture or disposal of
the share.

person of whom they do not approve and they may refuse to register the transfer of a
share on which the company has a lien or where such transfer is restricted by the Act or

period of the company shall not exceed the greater of 40 per cent. of the company’s net
profits after tax in such accounting period and any dividend floor set by the Special
Shareholder for such accounting period (as communicated by the Special Shareholder
to the company in writing at the same time or immediately after the Special Shareholder

interim dividends on shares which confer deferred or non-preferred rights with regard to
dividend as well as on shares which confer preferential rights with regard to dividend,
but no interim dividend shall be paid on shares carrying deferred or non- preferred rights
if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrear. The board may also pay
at intervals settled by them any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to them that
the profits available for distribution justify the payment. Provided the directors act in
good faith they shall not incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred
rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim dividend on any
shares having deferred or non- preferred rights.

CALCULATION OF DIVIDENDS

Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to shares, all dividends shall be
declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on which the
dividend is paid. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the
amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of
which the dividend is paid; but, if any share is issued on terms provided that it shall rank
for dividend as from a particular date, that share shali rank for dividend accordingly.

DIVIDENDS NOT IN CASH

Ageneral meeting declaring a dividend may, upon the recommendation of the board,
direct that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of assets and, where
any difficulty arises in regard to the distribution, the board may settle the same and in
particular may issue fractional certificates and fix the value for distribution of any assets
and may determine that cash shall be paid to any member upon the footing of the value
so fixed in order to adjust the rights of members and may vest any assets in trustees.
