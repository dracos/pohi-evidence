Subject: FW: If. A JR question
Attachment: RE: Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Legal Privilege

Please see attached advice re JR. This was in response to some specific questions about actions we were considering
back in June so is not as comprehensive as you might like.

For information, the reason for my email was that I had thought there had been subsequent written legal advice but
there was not. I understand that Chris spoke to Stephen Hocking about whether we could simply bring the Scheme in
house and the answer was that carried too great a risk.

I think in our options we should consider any other ideas we may have.

Best wishes

Subject: If. A JR question

I do not think I ever saw the advice that set out the JR risk associated with closing the Scheme but I think we
should revisit the question in, say, September. Paula has asked for this. The reasons are based on a series of

‘what ifs' which are or have the potential to become increasingly real and relevant.

What if:
POL00307631
POL00307631

- Second Sight's reports are so bland as to only restate what the applicant has said

- Second Sight's reports always recommend mediation

- JFSA refuse to engage in any discussions about mediation except where Second Sight recommend no
mediation

The answer is that Post Office, in effect, take the decision on whether or not to mediate.
Therefore, what is the role of the Working Group except to chase cases through the Scheme?
Would you please be able to send me the JR advice from Beechcrofts?

Best wishes
