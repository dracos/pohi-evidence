Gavin and David,

Sorry to badger but:-

Gavin, I am still awaiting your OK to send the below email to Rodric.

“Thank you for providing the update on both the disclosure of the Super User risk and the wider process with Freeths
and in particular taking the time to highlight the references to Fujitsu (or related inferences) to assist our review, it is
appreciated.

Having reviewed the documents and in light of discussions we’ve had to date, our key concern is with respect toa
view that the theoretical points regarding Super Users may be either misunderstood or the associated protections
not fully appreciated. In order to further support Post Office, we would like to offer to address this theoretical point
by providing you with a comprehensive paper that provides clarity with respect to our view of the points raised and
provides details as to the measures and protections in place to ensure that any such risk is and remains only
theoretical. In order that for us to do this we request sight of the relevant points highlighted in any reports that gave
rise to this concern so that we may address them in our response and outline how the systems and security processes
that we have in place would expose or prevent any attempt (noting there is no evidence to suggest there ever has
been such an attempt) to use the Super User facility to affect branch accounts outside of any proper and agreed
process.

Whilst this may be considered to be subject to the provisions of Clause 25, as a gesture of goodwill we propose to
provide this paper without any making any charge to Post Office on the basis that we hope it addresses Post Office’s
concerns and enables you to close this theoretical issue.

We would also appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you how we conclude this matter. Whilst we acknowledge
that, to a certain extent, the claims issued by Freeths and the responses they require are outside of your control, we
remain concerned that there remains no articulations as to what triggers the end of the audit process. We have
repeatedly highlighted our concerns that the audits and other associated activities are seeking to prove a negative
which, as well as being impossible, will be (and is) a very expensive exercise. As per the above, we want to be
supportive and assist in clarifying any issues but without a clear articulation of when the associated activity will
conclude, we will not be in a position to fund it and hence our continued position that this is, save for occasional ad
hoc instances, a chargeable activity.”

David — are you OK with me setting up a meeting and agreeing a way forward generally with Rodric or did you want
to?

Many thanks.
Best regards,

Chris

Pete,
Subject to Nigel and Gavin’s OK, I would advise that it be sent by me under “Joint Legal Privilege”.
NB I believe that there is a missing “we” per below.

Pete,

I’ve had a play! Not sure the last paragraph is necessary but depends on our tactics. Feel free to improve and then
when we’re happy we can share with Gavin and Nigel. Query whether this should be sent by you or Chris Jay back to
Rodric?

Thanks

Suggested text, will need review with Torstein to make sure I am not running too far:

Thank you for providing the update on both the disclosure of the Super User risk and the wider process with Freeths.
Having reviewed this information in order for Fujitsu to further support to Post Office in explaining the extremely low
probability of the theoretical risk disclosed being realised a document from Deloittes which describes the processes
and actions that would be required in order to show a material effect on a Sub-Post Masters Accountsthey-envisaged-
when-conducting their review. This will enable Fujitsu to further investigate and produce a disclosable paper outlining
the systems and security processes in place that would either prevent or expose any attempt to use the Super User

facility to affect branch accounts.

If as part of the ongoing litigation any of the claimants can evidence transactions that need to be investigated further
with respect to the Super User risk Fujitsu would be happy to provide more detailed analysis in order to support Post

Office in their defence activities.
Hope this works.
