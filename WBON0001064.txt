Mark, Lewis,

As discussed on the call this morning I attach a document containing our initial questions on the draft Bramble Report.

I'd be grateful if you would let me know how long it is likely to take you to provide responses.
Feel free to give me a call if there is anything you'd like to discuss.

Kind regards

Jonny
