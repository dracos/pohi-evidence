Dear all,

I wanted to inform you in advance of today’s meeting that Belinda Crowe will be joining the Steering Group from today.
I have asked her to provide support to Project Sparrow in three main ways:

* to provide secretariat support for the Chair and Working Group;

* to act as the main channel of communication between the Chair of the Working Group and the business; and

© to provide broader strategic support and advice to me as Chair of the Steering Group and to the Group itself, across
all of the Project Sparrow workstreams.

Separately, Belinda will also be helping to co-ordinate a short internal ‘lessons learned’ exercise on the process
leading up to the publication of the Second Sight report. We will discuss the approach to this in future steering groups,
but in brief the aim of the exercise will be to discuss collectively what insights the business can take from the
experience.

See you all shortly,
Paula

Paula Vennells I Chief Executive
