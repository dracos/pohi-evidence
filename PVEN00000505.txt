Hi Jane. I’m so sorry I’m not around to help.

The only other thought following on from our discussion is for you to talk to Ken as SID.

He should treat that as confidential (you must ask him to) and you can then share the worry about
any other angles being suggested. And my question re how the judge might have been chosen.
Happy for you to say I suggested it if useful.

Jane, I was listening on the earlier call. I get the impression Tim intends to join the main [board] call
now? Obviously he doesn’t know I was on the [earlier] call. Can you let me know if you still want me
to give a view? Thx Paula

Sorry Paula - i wasn’t watching my phone and didn’t see your message. The board has approved both
appeal and the recusal. Happy to discuss if that helps.

PV: Thx - I’m pleased. I would like to - are you free now? Or anytime after 3.30pm?

JMcL: Apologies Paula. Been running around getting things going. I’ve now come to court to hear the
FJ evidence. I'll call you during the next break, but maybe as late as 4.45 - is that ok?

PV: Yes fine. Thx P

Hi Al, any chance of a quick call -

As Tim and Tom are excusing themselves from the recusal decision and Ken is v worried about
chairing it, she has asked if I might offer a view, by email and caveated of course.

I'm prepared to do that but as you know, I would normally consult widely on something this serious.
We can talk before or after the Lord Grabiner call.
Are you ok if I join that - happy to do so silently if it helps?

Let me know on both?
Thx
Paula

Let me know you’re ok?

And yes, I felt the same about the board. Very proud and pleased. Difficult but completely the right
decision. (The opposite would have been unconscionable after what both Lords Grabiner and

Neuberger said.)
