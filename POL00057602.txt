23/08/08 The Post Ofice® Network Auditors, led by Paul Field visited Ibstock Post Ofice® on Wednesday 20”

‘Augus: 2008 to conduct a verification of assets audit. After being admitted to the office the wife of the
Postmaster, Mrs Susan RUDKIN requested a private word with Paul Field, She then informed him that the

safe would be around £40,000 short.

The office which has 3 HORIZON terminals and employs 5 part time statf is sited within a newsagents and
general dealers in a rural village on the outskirts of Leicester. There Is also a sorting office on the premises

which is a base for 14 postmen,

December 2006,

Mr Rudkin said that he would allow an interview ‘o take place on his premises and said that his wife would

cooperate fully with any investige

n and would not require a solicitor.

He handed me a signed admission statement, by Mrs Rudkin and informed me that at the time, the

POL00057602
During the interview Susan Rudkin explained that her husband was heavily involved in NFSP work and she
‘elt that the pressure of running the private business, the Post Office and the household finances had
gotten too much. She said that the Post Office had been experiencing losses and she had been in‘lating
the cash on hand to cover it up. She also said that she had been taking cash from the Post Office® and
paying it into their Lloyds bank business account to cover bills. It was not possible to establish an exact
date when the theft started but she said that she had been under pressure since the robbery. Susan
Rudkin said that she felt embarrassed to tell her husband about the situation and felt that she had let him
down, When asked about the cash declarations she said she that she kept a running total of the shortages
and just added this amount onto the dally figures, She was adamant that no one else knew what she was
doing and on the occasions that other staff members declared the cash she would overwrite the figures.
‘Susan Rudkin acknowledged that she had stolen the money from the Post Office® (although the initial

Intention was to repay It) and was not at present able to repay It

Mr & Mrs Rudkin live in a 6/7 bedroom premises attached to the Post Office® valued at around £450k.

There is a £250k mortgage outstanding and the only other known debt is a credit card statement for

around £10k. None of these figures can be confirmed until the usual financial check results are received.

Mr Rudkin feels there will be no prosecution when the money is repaid and he will be reinstated in post,

Piease find attached a section 18 request to be served on the defendant should she plead or be found,

guilty in a crown court.

We need to ensure that our agents ask for confiscation and ask for compensation, and that they request,
the compensation be deferred to the outcome of any future confiscation hearing,

With an outstanding amount for £43,894.15 the court may" Incorrectly’ at an early time agree confiscation

and compensation and make an order at the time of the hearing without waiting for a financial report (I say

incorrectly because this offence falls into the category of “General Criminal Conduct” and as such it would
bbe impossible at this point ‘or the court to agree the defendant's total bene‘ from crime). In this case the

section 18 need not be served but the increase In the value of money from Jan 07 offence start

2009 added (this being the latest figure on hand) and a bene’, con‘iscation and compensation figure of

£44,689.82 should be sought.

As discussed, I spoke with Mike Rudkin today and asked him if he was willing to allow
another temp to use the branch. Mr Rudkin informed me that he was but due to the fact that
he is currently experiencing serious financial difficulties he would be looking to charge rent
commensurate with the market value of the business and would also need the temp to pick up
the utility costs for the business ie. Electric/Gas/Water, which are currently in the region of
£5k per annum. Mr Rudkin also informed me that there are 5 members of staff working in the
Post Office. There is a full-time member of staff (Sue Ball) and 4 part-timers and the annual
wage cost is in the region of £32-33k per annum. I hope this information is of some help.

Subject: Ibstock Post Office

Dear Glenn

After ten months, some OK but the majority full of problems of one
sort or another I have decided to give you notice to quit at Ibstock post
office.

I only agreed to become temporary SPM in order to try and help
Michael out of the financial difficulties he was having,

The whole of the salary after wages went to Michael and I have not
taken anything for myself, the agreement between us was simply that
he would do everything he could to assist me where possible.

Unfortunately there have been problems on occasions with the
balancing of the lottery and the pay station, which are on the retail
counter.

Although I have been able to overcome these problems the situation
has created a atmosphere of mistrust between us all including the
staff.

I have always had a good relationship with the staff who Michael has
continued to pay under their contract of employment with him. and
their commitment to the job under the circumstances has been
commendable.

As well as the problems I have mentioned the staff are now unhappy
with the reluctance of Michael to pay them for the total hours they are
working.

My contracts provider has advised me not to take on the staff if] am
not taking an income out of the business and although I would in
different circumstances have no problem employing them, I must take
the professional advice I have been given.

Although my resignation from Ibstock may well mean even more
financial hardship for Michael I am not prepared to continue within.
the same premises, as the breakdown in trust between all of us has
proved one hurdle too many.

My last day at Ibstock will be on Wednesday 1st December.

I have not informed anyone yet of my decision as I have tried to speak
to you first but unable to contact you as yet.

I would also appreciate that this remains confidential.
