Subject: RE: James' meeting with Ron

Dear Alwen and Paula,

The meeting yesterday was good. The MPs attending were Andrew Bridgen, Mike Wood, Tessa Munt, and
Mary Glindon. Edward Garnier sent a representative, and I acted for myself and also as Oliver Letwin’s proxy.

Ron and his colleague Ian Henderson were impressive, and subject to what I say below we were happy for
them to proceed. There was some discussion with regard to the number of cases to be considered, and
whether the initial investigation of 10-12 might widen out to consider more (we felt it should), and possibly
lead to a more systems-focused approach. This will, I suspect, become obvious as 2nd Sight move through the
first cases.

I must make one comment, however, and that is with regard to the Justice for SubPostmasters Alliance. The
MPs are all extremely keen, as I know are you, for the subpostmaster to be supportive of this process.
Important to that is Mr Alan Bates, who heads the Alliance. I have offered him a meeting with myself, Ron,
and Ian, before the House rises on 17 July (although this is so important that in extremis I would be prepared
to meet after that date). I am waiting to hear from him. Whilst I do not believe he should have the power of a
veto over either the appointment of 2"¢ Sight nor how the investigations ought to be undertaken, we would
like as far as possible to win his support. Until I hear from him, I think it would be unwise to proceed. Details
are already getting into the media, and if we barrelled forth without resolution as to whether Mr Bates attends
a meeting, and what his reaction is, I think we would be heading for trouble.

I will keep you posted.

Yours ever,
James
