in my first analysis of the messagestore supplied, it would appear that the
declarations being written away were done so at the time that the EOD process
kicked in. The message which indicates the Riposte failure
(putpersistentobject) should have allowed the user at least to have backed
lout and start again, which seems to happen satisfactorily when these
conditions are simulated on a development system. As Les has indicated
learlier a system restart should be sufficient to get them back and working

K, in which case I would suspect this call should be dropped to a 'B'. Will
sce if I can simulate the failure whilst in the midst of an EOD scenario.

I've talked to Brian Orzell about the ‘lock' errors written away by Riposte
land it would appear this is an indication of Riposte being rather sick. There

FUJ00070841
FUJ00070841

fire Several DIl’s and excecutables all being told to go away becuase of this
locking problem. Either some application has left some write lock on
inadvertantly or Riposte is sick as described. A reboot should sort this out
lor try redeclaring on an alternate system. Brian Orzell has sugested routing
this for the attention of Mark Jarosz.

If} Response :

ly assesment of what happened is that on Wednesday Ist Nov at 18:32:13 a lock
was acquired on the run table which was not released. This had the subsequent
effect of causing may Riposte API calls to fail and hence the applications
connected to Riposte could not function reliably. I would speculate that the
probable cause was a thread silently failing but have no way of proving this.
Ir will check with Escher to confirm my assesment is reasonable and if not
further update this PinICL.

in the meantime I would recommend that in future occurences a restart of
IRiposte should be attempted prior to rebooting NT.

If the frequency of occurence of such an event becomes significant (> 1 per
month) then we will need to create a reproducible case
