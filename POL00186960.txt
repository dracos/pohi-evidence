Attached is the briefing note.

lam unclear on two points as I don’t think we are aligned with Second Sight:
1. The number of cases (second sight seem reluctant to limit to two or three)
2. The date for the findings (second sight say they need three months)

I have highlighted these two point in red in the briefing.

So this is where we are now. Susan I have a call with SS at 4.30 after which we will know what
Paula can say to James tomorrow. Would it be worth updating the brief as far as we can before
that call, Simon would you be able to do that and send back to Mark and I especially anything you
can do on stakeholder. Sorry still dying to get minutes sorted

Thanks
