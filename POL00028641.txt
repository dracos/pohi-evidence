Subject: Pathway Complaint 2nd September, 1998

At the last CNT, Tony Oppenheim requested an addition to the minutes which he stated reflected
his comments at the previous meeting. It was as follows:

“Tony Oppenheim expressed grave concer at the apparent change in the BA view of timescales
with respect to the end to end testing and therefore roll out. BA had explained to Pathway that the
end to end testing would require 212 elapsed days per logical test day. Tony Oppenheim said that
the impact of the change was to extend timescales by some 9 - 12 months. The way in which this
was communicated to ICL, through the Treasury Panel without normal prior discussion, was a
matter of considerable disappointment to Tony Oppenheim”

Tony Oppenheim did make these comments and he has expanded upon them in a subsequent
telephone call to me. He is particularly aggrieved at the presentation of the information. He told

me that on the Wednesday morning before being presented with the initial interim findings of the

Panel, Pathway received a fax from Dave Miller. It contained a change of roll-out dates from April

1999 (where they had been the previous Friday) to April 2000. He stated that this was a judgement

from PA following discussion with CAPS. It was considered by Pathway that these dates had been
—‘dropped in” by BA through PA...» = np ag er

If the above is inaccurate, we should correct it. If it is accurate, are there any further comments that
you would wish me to make to correctly reflect our case. I have spoken to lawyers and this is not a
legal issue per se, but you may be concerned about presentation.
