I was very pleased indeed with our meeting last week. Thank you for seeing me, and for
being so willing to hear things from this side of the fence.

What we agreed regarding how we proceed sounds very good indeed. I have asked Janet
Walker in my office to contact Paula Vennells to discuss the details about the initial meeting
with other MPs. I would like to propose something for the week starting 18 June. Until Janet
speaks to Paula, I am not divulging details of our meeting to anyone. It strikes me that we
ought to talk to MPs first before briefing any wider, and I hope you might agree.

Thank you again. It was good to see you, and I am sure what is proposed is exactly what
ought to be done.
