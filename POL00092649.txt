MAJOR INCIDENT REPORT

Incident Summary

We experienced performance issues as a result of security patching to the
Virtual Private Network (VPN)

Service Impacted

At any one time, the incident affected an average of 1,200 counters (out of
approximately 30,000 in the estate) Horizon Online counter positions. The
impact gradually reduced as the packages were regressed and was
completely resolved by 11:57.

Analysis of Problem

There is an ongoing investigation into the security patches.

Root Cause Analysis

To be confirmed

In order to restore service, the packages were regressed on the IRE19

Corrective Actions VSD servers (which host the IRE19 VPX servers). The IRE11 VPX servers
were taken offline to force the VPN traffic through IRE19.

Date Time Activity

1/4/2012 07:40 NNM Branch Ping Results showed an average of 892 gateway counters offline.
After contacting Windows team it was suspected that these were being caused by
MSC 333244 that was in progress in order to do Windows patching.

41:33 NNM Branch Ping Results showed an average of 1193 gateway counters offline.
As MSC 333244 was now complete, SMC escalated to the Post Office Account
Out of Hours Duty Manager. Call routed to Core ISP as per normal process.
Checks confirmed there was no problem with the branch network ADSL
connections.

16:45 Random sites from the NNM report were Tivoli health checked successfully. This
result added further weight to the fault being a NNM reporting problem.

TFS 5232217 routed to NOSS Team to resolve the NNM reporting problem.

Post Office Account Out of Hours Duty Manager escalated tl information to the

POSD Out of Hours Duty Manager.

18:35 Post Office Account Out of Hours Duty Manager called an internal conference call
to discuss the problem.

19:00 Internal conference call reconvened, however the NNM Branch Ping Results
showed an average of 452 gateway counters offline.

20:35 Internal conference call reconvened. Post Office Account Out of Hours Duty
Manager requested SMC to manually health check more failing sites.

21:45 Internal conference call reconvened. Following the request at 20:35, SMC
confirmed that approximately 70% of failing sites were manually health checking,
therefore taking the failing sites under threshold. These results suggested it was a
reporting issue.
