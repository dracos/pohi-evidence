Post Office intro briefing for SoS February 2023.pptx

OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE: COMMERCIAL

I understand that David Bickerton has an intro meeting with SoS at noon on 21 February. I attach an
introductory slide deck about the Post Office, which is likely to be one of the central topics.

Please could you forward to SpAds as I’m not yet sure of the right email address.
