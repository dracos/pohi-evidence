Tom

To see the view of the BEIS Legal Director in the below email on your role.

Perhaps I can get your thoughts on Monday before I email Jane as we discussed earlier. I have already explained to her
that the shareholder should not be involved in the decision and indicated that I was considering with you the extent to
which you should be involved. I think Patrick's view is a sensible one i.e. flag the things the board need to be cognisant of
but not to be part of the formal board decision.

You have my numbers if you want to discuss over the weekend.

Kind regards

Richard

Richard, Gareth
I don't think I would want to say Government NEVER consider a bias challenge - but in the sense of never say never.

I would have thought the function of the UKGI director might be to ensure the Board fully realised the seriousness of what
was proposed including the impact on the shareholder (and the difficulties of distinguishing between strategic direction
and operational matters in Parliament and the media) as well as the wider litigation strategy on Horizon, that the Board
had taken and properly considered legal advice - not a step to take on finely based merits, and finally had reflected
properly on whether there was bias or (painful as it is) inferences drawn ultimately properly from hearing the evidence
expressed in pithy and robust language. If the UKGI director has done that, I would agree s/he may stand back from the
decision to take the challenge or not

Gareth, Patrick,

Would you agree that the UKGI Director on POL's board should not be involved in any decision by the company about a
recusal application?

While I'm not convinced that there is a conflict of interest I think that given the concern, rightly, that HMG should not be
seen as questioning the independence and integrity of the judiciary it feels presentationally difficult for a director
appointed by the shareholder to be involved in the decision. Put another way it seems preferable that the UKGI Director
is not involved.

Kind regards

Not including Alex or Gavin in this email but copying in Patrick and Gareth from BEIS legal with whom I have raised the
issue about a possible recusal application on the grounds of bias. I shared with them Jane's email and the accompanying
note from Lord Neuberger and they have engaged on this issue at a high level in the Government Legal Department.

The particular concern here is anything that could be seen as HMG not upholding the independence and integrity of the
judiciary.

While we think it is OK for Alex to be informed we don't not consider the shareholder should be involved in a decision
whether or not to make a recusal application. That is properly a matter for the POL board. I am, of course, happy to
assist you as a Director on the board in carrying out your role.

Kind regards

>; Russell,

Alex
The judgement in the first trial is out and it is adverse to POL. You'll get the briefing by 3pm.

There are a couple of things that I need to brief you on and on which POL is asking for a quick decision. It’s a high profile
decision to do with handling the case with significant implications for BEIS.

Do you have time for a call later today or over the weekend?

Tom
