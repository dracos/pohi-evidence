£13,500 of cash has at any time, since you’ve been

working at that post office since 2005, have you

ever taken any money belonging to the Post Office

AH I have not taken anything belonging to the post
office not one penny.

~30 CK Right are you aware of anybody else who’s ever
taken any money?

AH I can’t see them that they have no I trust them
completely.

CK Right that’s fine that’s fine.

AH I'd be shocked if they had.

06 Pw Have you ever performed a transaction on Horizon
knowing it to be fraudulent you know sort of in
regard to your lottery if you like or in regard to
anything else?

AH No I haven't.

Pw Paid a bill without putting the money in or things
like that?

AH No I haven't.

PW So it’s not actually taking the money but doing
something that would cause a loss to the post
office?

AH No I wouldn’t know where to start on it to be
honest.

CK Right so you’re adamant that the £14,000 is
nothing that you’ve done criminally?

AH I have not taken a penny out of that post office
criminally I wouldn’t dare.

CK It’s something to do with some sort of discrepancy
in transactions?

AH I think it’s to do with a discrepancy with the

lottery and I’m hoping that we can come to the

bottom of this. I will pay any money back what’s

owed to Post Office Limited. I am not a thief I
will pay anything back but I just want all this to
be looked at in detail and because Horizon
system’s not 100% if I have got all the details
here I’d like that to be taken into account

please.

AH said she knew how much to add on to make her
accounts balance as she wrote it down on a piece
of paper. She said she asked for help when it all

got too much.

AH was shown a cash declaration timed at 17.39 on
28th 7 2010 showing her cash on hand of
£10,401.88 which she said was the day before her
holiday. She was shown another one on the same
date at 19.08 with a cash figure of £23,151.00

the difference being her £10 notes.

That’s falsifying account isn’t it which I’ve said
that I’ve admitted to that.

Right Alison I have to inform you that you may
have rendered yourself liable to prosecution, you
do not have to say anything but it may harm your
defence if you do not mention now something which
you later rely on in Court, anything you do say
may be given in evidence. Do you wish to clarify
anything you have said or add anything else before
the end of the interview?

I’m just sorry for all this mess what I’ve put
