*Consultants conclusions on likely National Roll-Out
start date
— 50% chance of January 2000 y,
— Planning date should be April 2000 (CL
*Conclusion based on
— Unexpected BA inputs on need for increased testing
— POCL readiness to “manage” automation in the business
— Lack of clarity on BA/POCL acceptance process
— Interaction between NR2 and NR2+ due to RCD caveats

“ICL Pathway response

— Unacceptable and unnecessary delay
— Restated plan date of April 1999 for NRO

*POCL position
