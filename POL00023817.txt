Subject: Appeal

Andy

A point for discussion tonight — I think we will need to get a 2" opinion on the likelihood of success on appeal. While
David & Tony have consistently warned us that the judge was the biggest risk, an appeal will be based on the merits of
the legal arguments, so we will need to be able to demonstrate to the Board and shareholder that an appeal is
appropriate, and (hopefully) likely to be successful.

Let’s discuss the implications of that tonight.

Thanks,

Jane
