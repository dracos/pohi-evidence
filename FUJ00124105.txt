Andrew,

Thanks for the info you have supplied me with on these two cases. I thought I should try and clarify
exactly what you want from me.

My understanding from Rachael was that all that is required is a signed version of a standard report I
produced a couple of months ago (attached - together with 2 related documents). If that is the case I
can get that produced, scanned and emailed to you in a couple of days.

However having read through the info you’ve given me, perhaps you want me to cover some further things.
Some observations:

1. In the case of Nield & Sefton, it is stated losses started in 2005 and this is linked to the
installation of Horizon. My report shows that Horizon was rolled out between 1999 and 2002, so 2005
doesn’t seem to tie in with Horizon being installed. NB I have no records as to exactly when Horizon was
installed in any Branch and I don’t know if Post Office Ltd have any such records. Similarly I have no
idea if this mismatch of dates is material.

2. At some point in 2010 the Post office would have been migrated from the original Horizon system to

the new Horizon Online system. This is mentioned in the Grant Allen case but not in the Nield & Sefton
case.

Note that I have no information regarding complaints or investigations into Horizon, and it has already
been established that it is not possible to examine the original Horizon system that was operational
until 2010.

similarly, I have not been presented with any audit data relating to any of these cases to examine.

Regards
Gareth

Dear Rachael / Gareth,

Please find enclosed outlines of the the two cases which involve me.

Of the two, i would say that the Sefton & nield case is the more urgent, and therefore Gareth i would
be grateful if you could concentrate on that one first. it is listed for trial in Jan and they have been
waiting longer for this report. the allen case is only for plea and case management on 10th December.
in an ideal world i would like to serve a report before the 10th if possible, but in any event we do not
have a defence case statement in that matter yet.

regards
