Working Group (WG) Update:
Cases where individual has been prosecuted - Tony wants Post Office to thoroughly
review each case submitted to the mediation process. He is expecting us to look at
areas within the case that may be suitable for mediation and then refer them to the
Working Group. If there are any additional themes / findings as we progress through the
process then Post Office will have a duty of care to disclose information.

« Closing of the Mediation Scheme application process — it was agreed by the WG that
Post Office would issue a statement (this will provide JFSA with a reference point).

immediate resolutions.
