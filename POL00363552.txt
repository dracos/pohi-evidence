Signing a statement of truth

Awitness statement must have a "statement of truth". This is a statement confirming that the person making it
believes that the facts stated in the document are true. The penalties for signing a statement of truth without an honest
belief in the truth of the facts being verified are potentially severe. A person who makes a false statement in litigation
in an attempt to interfere with the course of justice will be in contempt of court, which is punishable by a prison
sentence of up to two years.

Please could you:

carefully review your witness statement;
if you are satisfied with the content of the same, please sign the statement of truth;
email me a PDF of the signed witness statement; and

send the original signed witness statement to Victoria Brooks at Womble Bond Dickinson, Temple Quay, 3
Temple Back East, Bristol BS1 6DZ.
