Dear Mrs Athwal
Re: Post Office Ferndown branch, 3 Penny’s Walk, BH22 9TH

Thank you for your letter and enclosures of 14 June addressed to
Donald Brydon, Chairman Royal Mail Group Ltd and David Smith,
Managing Director Post Office Ltd about the summary termination of
your Contract for Services. Your correspondence has been forwarded
to me and I have been asked to reply to you directly.

The contents of your letter have been noted but it is not
appropriate for Donald or other board members to investigate
personally on your behalf. In your letter you ask for estoppel.
As your Contract for Services has already been summarily
terminated, estoppel is not appropriate. Should a subpostmaster
want to appeal against a decision to summarily terminate a Contract
for Services, as is the case here, we have established and robust
processes in place that are designed to protect the interests of
the subpostmaster and Post Office Limited and which are in
accordance with guidelines agreed with the National Federation of
Subpostmasters.

I note from your enclosures you have already advised Carol Ballan,
Contract Manager, that it is your intention to appeal and Carol
will be writing to you this week to confirm that she is arranging
for your appeal to be heard by a member of the Post Office Appeal
Authority. Once appointed, the appeals manager will contact you
directly to explain the next steps. I can assure you that the
appeal is not simply a review but a complete and independent re-
hearing of the case, at which the points you want to make can be
put forward and explored. All correspondence concerning your
appeal will be sent to you directly.

Your request for information under the Freedom of Information Act
is being responded to separately by our Freedom of Information

unit.

Yours sincerely,
