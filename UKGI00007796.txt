Attachment: Response to Liz Truss, POL, 16 Feb.pdf
Henry, all,

SofS is happy to appoint Tom Cooper as our shareholder representative to POL.

He is also content to send the attached letter to CST. Please could the pro-forma be sent by officials (also attached),
as he did not wish to mention it in the letter and I therefore believe it is best communicated by official channels.

Yours,
Robert

Dear Rob,

Please find attached a submission for the attention of Secretary of State, kindly provided by UKGI, concerning new
NED appointments at Post Office Ltd.

Alex asked me to forward this on his behalf; as following consideration and clearance, he expressed that he was keen
for proposals to be supported with the attached memo, for the attention of Secretary of State. Could you please
provide this as cover for the submission when it goes to SoS?

Minister Griffiths, Glenn Hall and AC have reviewed, and are content with the submission.
Happy to discuss.

Best wishes,
Henry
