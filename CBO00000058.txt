      PRIME MINISTER



      BAJPOCL

       The Fujitsu Board met this morning. They have decided not to walk away from
       the contract at this stage. This is on the basis that we would write to ICL giving
       an assurance to take a decision by 10 May; and that we would provide a
        contribution towards their (audited) cash costs over this period. Fujitsu has
        included a provision of f300 mn in its accounts to reflect the sums they have so
        far spent on the project, but have stood down the planned announcement of
         their results to analysts in Japan. The provision can only be removed if legally
         binding heads of agreement are reached on a way forward by 10 May. We must
          now pursue urgently with all the parties the large affordability gap associated
          with Option B1.

         Background

          My minute of yesterday recorded where matters stood in advance of the Fujitsu
          Board meeting this morning to sign off their end year accounts. Ministers - Alistair
          Darling, Steven Byers, Charlie Falconer and myself - had agreed that we wanted
                                                                                   significant
          to do everything possible to keep Option B I in play. However the very
                                                                                      required
           affordability gap meant that further scrutiny of POCL's business case was
                                                                                  two weeks.
           before a decision could be taken. This would take a further period of
                                                                            Fujitsu.
            This message was communicated to ICL, and through them, to

                                                                                   provision in
            2.    This was significantly short of what Fujitsu required to avoid a
                                                                              ICL two further
            their accounts. On our instruction Steve Robson had offered
                                                                                                             CB000000058

      concessions - an assurance that the Government would take a decision before 12
      May when ICL are legally required to file their accounts; and a contribution
      towards ICL's on-going costs of continuing with the project pending that decision
       (of up to £8 million). ICL interpreted this as a sign of our goodwill.


        Fujitsu's decision


         3.          The Fujitsu Board met this morning. On the basis of our further concessions
         they decided not to terminate at this stage. They have stood down a presentation
         of their end year results to analysts in Japan. They have, however, included a
          provision in their accounts given the absence of a legally binding agreement to
          take the project forward. However we understand it will be possible to remove the
              provision if legally binding heads of agreement on a way forward can be signed
              before the 12 May.


               Next steps


                4.       The next steps are therefore:

                                                                                            giving them

    The Government has done all it
                                       can to find a way through the current
     difficulties with the project, and to salvage the
                                                       time and effort all parties have
     devoted to it. But it cannot do this at any
                                                  price. It would be wrong for the
      taxpayer to bail out ICL; and unfair to other
                                                     suppliers who originally bid for the
       contracts.


        Even now, the Government would be willing to continue discussions with
                                                                               ICL.
        But ICL/Fujitsu have now chosen to walk away.


        The Government remains committed to the automation of post offices and will
        support the Post Office in seeking an alternative system to meet this objective.

          In the meantime, the Government will continue existing arrangements for
          paying benefits, including over the counter at post offices.

         Brief history

          3.         A consortium led by
                                            ICL won the contract in 1996.
                                                                            Under PFI
                      arrangements, they undertook to meet the
                                                                 development cost of the
                      project, in the expectation that
                                                       they would reap a substantial return
                                                                                            on
                      that investment once the project
                                                         was up and running.

           4.          It soon became apparent ICL that
                                                          had overstretched themselves: they
                       underestimated the technical requirements and despite
                                                                               backing from
                       Fujitsu did not have sufficient financial cover.


               5.       ICL were placed in breach of contract by the public sector
                                                                                parties in
                        November 1997 for failure to meet a key milestone. Since then, far from
                         improving their performance there have been further delays and missed
                         milestones, with the end date for getting the system in place stretching
                          ever further into the future.

                6.        Under the original contracts the system should have been operational by
                          the end of 1998 and fully up and running throughout the Post Office
                          network. On current plans, it may be completed three years late at the
                           end of 2001; but the problems with current testing make even this look
                           unlikely.

   7.       ICL did not have to sign

            should not be expected to bail them

                                             way to resolve the difficulties.

            What is the Government going to
                                                   do instead?

             Government is fully committed to the

                                                       offices; and to provide a simple, fraud-
             resistant way of paying benefits. The
                                                     Government will support the Post Office
              in seeking an alternative automation
                                                     platform. Benefits will continue to be paid
               over post office counters in the usual way.
                                                           DSS will be seeking alternative

                                                              it result in widespread
                closures?

                  Government will support the Post Office in seeking an alternative automation
                  platform, but in the meantime it will be business as usual for post offices.
                  Benefits will continue to be paid over post office counters as they are now.

         Is the Government going to

           What about the White Paper on the Post
                                                           Office?

           It clearly remains our intention to publish the
                                                            White Paper on Post Office

           itself, the implications of these events for our
                                                            modernising programme before
            the White Paper issues. But the Government remains
                                                                   committed to providing
            the Post Office with greater commercial freedom and to a more
                                                                              competitive
             postal market and independent regulation, as set out in our policy
                                                                                 statement on
             the future of the Post Office (Mandelson, 7 December 1998).

             Isn't this just another example, in a growing list, of failed PFI projects in
             the IT sector?

             There is nothing fundamentally wrong with PFI procurements nor are there any
             fundamental flaws with taking IT projects forward under PFI — others are
             being delivered successfully: providing good value and service to the public-
             sector and attractive return to the private sector investors. For example:

             ICL say Ministers have been too slow to take decisions?

             Government is committed to the objectives of the project, and wanted to find a
             way of resolving the difficulties. Large and complex project, significant amount
             of public money at stake. Only right that it should consider very carefully how
             to move forward.

       What are the implications for inward

        location for the company.                                     attractive investment

          What arc the implications
                                        for the future investment
                                                                 from Japan generally?
          The issues here are not about
                                        Japanese investment in the UK.
          range of factors which have led to                           There are a wide
                                             the UK being Europe's number
          investment location for Japanese companies                        one
                                                       with over 40% of Japanese
           investment here. These factors have not
                                                   changed.

           Is termination of the project a reaction to
                                                       Fujitsu closing its semi-
           conductor plant in the North East?

           There is absolutely no connection whatsoever between these two events. The
           Government continues to work closely with Fujitsu and its Response Group to
           try and find a buyer for the Newton Aycliffe plant and together we have
           succeeded in placing 80% of the 570 strong workforce in alternative
            employment, full time training or higher education.

                         these discussions to ensure that Alistair Darling's interests arc protected.


              5.         At the same time my officials will continue to explore with DSS and DTI
              our fall-back position.


              6.      We will need to be in a position by the end of next week to begin making
               a final decision about whether the affordability gap on Option 81 can be closed.
               I will report back with further advice on the basis of this further work in advance
                   of the 10 May deadline.

  My minute of yesterday recorded where matters

  Darling, Steven Byers, Charlie Falconer and myself - had agreed
                                                                     that we wanted

  affordability gap meant that further scrutiny of POCL's business case was required
   before a decision could be taken. This would take a further period of two weeks.
   This message was communicated to ICL, and through them, to Fujitsu.

 The Fujitsu Board meet tomorrow morning to decide whether to continue with

     4.     In view of the undeliverability of option A and the fact that option 131,
      although attractive, remained unaffordable, but with the prospect that further work
      might bridge the funding gap, we decided that Steve Robson should speak to !CL
       today to communicate the following points:

              • Ministers remained attracted to option BI and the potential scope for
              modernising government, provided it could be made affordable;

               - it was currently unaffordable;

               project pending a final decision by Ministers.

                                                        clear sign of goodwill from the

                                                               would be a matter for the
