                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




              FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF DIANE SARAH MATTHEWS



I Diane Matthews state the following:



1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry with

   the matters set out in the Rule 9 request dated 29th September 2023.



Background



2. I began my employment with Post Office Limited on 5th March 1986 as a counter

   clerk (PO Grade). My roles were in branch offices where I progressed to the role

   of Assistant Branch Manager. In 1999 I was seconded onto the Horizon project

   where I assisted the offices during the "Live Trial" phase mainly in Northern

   Ireland. As the roll out started, I undertook the role of Team Leader, managing a

   team of 22 Horizon Field Support Officers (HFSO's) in ensuring they were

   supported in managerial terms for example timetable, accommodation,

                                                                                      WITNO8330100




   performance. In 2003 I returned to my role as Assistant Branch Manager before

   taking up a role as Audit Manager with responsibilities for delivering an audit plan

   for the team as well as ad hoc audits where requested. I also undertook a small

   number of audits myself. In 2004, I accepted a temporarily move to the Post Office

   Limited Investigation team, initially to look at pension docket fraud. Approximately

   6 months later, this role was made permanent. In 2007 I was promoted to Security

   Manager, managing a small team of investigators. In 2008 I moved to Royal Mail

   Group as an investigator, a role I undertook until 2018 when I left the business

   under voluntary redundancy terms.




3. Upon joining the Investigation team, I completed a 6 week training course

   covering all aspects of the role including witness statement taking, analysing data,

   interviewing suspects, PACE, Risk Assessments. I also attended Thames Valley

   Police Training Centre and undertook a search course.



4. My understanding of the role of an Investigator within Post Office Limited was to

   obtain the facts and circumstances pertaining to a Post Office Counter loss and

   report this to the Legal team for their consideration as to next steps.



5. During my 4 years within Post Office Limited Security function I was line managed

   by Paul Dawkins and latterly David Pardoe. The Head of Investigations was

   initially Tony Utting who was succeeded by John Scott and Head of Security was

   Tony Marsh.

                                                                                       WITN08330100




6. I found the investigators, Team Leaders, Casework and Prosecution teams and

   the leadership of Tony Utting and Tony Marsh to be professional, had integrity and

   were committed to the business.



7. During 2007, I was promoted to Investigation Manager. This involved line

   managing approximately 6 investigators with their development and aspirations as

   well as day to day administrative duties. I was line managed during this period by

   David Pardoe with a level of input by Head of Security John Scott.




8. In my role as an Investigator/Investigation Manager, I played no part in disciplinary

   matters towards Subpostmasters apart from provide a report to the relevant Area

   Manager following any activity I attended at a Post Office. I was involved in the

   interviewing of accused individuals and subsequent reporting of these interviews.

   As part of any investigation following an interview with an accused, a further more

   in depth Investigation report compiled, a case file would be compiled and

   depending on the advice from the assigned lawyer, a committal bundle would be

   prepared which would ensure all evidence was forwarded to the legal team.



9. Any litigation strategy would be decided by the lawyers. There may have been

   some discussions with myself but this would be to tell me what their decision was.

   I have no legal training and the decision would be theirs. I would liaise with other

   Post Office departments which may include Pensions department (Northern

   Ireland) Helpline, Accounts, Audits and area management groups.

The Security team's role in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions



10. I have been asked to consider 23 documents to assist me in this section of

   questions. I wish to state that 16 documents were written after I had left the

   business and 1 (POL00104968) "POL — Enforcement & Prosecution Policy" is

   undated and I have no recollection of this document. I note Helen Dickinson is

   named as the "Reviewer". Mrs Dickinson assumed a management role after I left

   the business so I assume this was written post 2008.




11. I have reviewed the following 6 documents:

     .   Casework Management Policy (Version 1.0, March 2000) (POL00104747)

         and (Version 4.0, October 2022) (POL00104777)

     .   Rules and Standards Policy (Version 2.0, October 2000) (POL00104754)

     .   Investigation Procedures Policy (Version 2.0, January 2001) (POL00030687)

         Disclosure of Unused Material, Criminal Procedures and Investigations Act

         1996 Codes of Practice Policy (Version 1.0, May 2001) (POL00104762)

     .   Royal mail Group Ltd Criminal Investigation and Prosecution Policy (1

         December 2007) (POL00030578)

         Royal Mail Group Security — Procedures and Standards — Standards of

         Behaviour and Complaints Procedure (Version 2, October 2007)

         (POL00104806)



12. From my recollection, the investigators were split into teams across England,

   Scotland and Northern Ireland. Each team had a Team leader. I am unclear if


                                      Page 4 of 40
                                                                                           WI TNO8330100
                                                                                      WITNO8330100




   there was another level of management before the Head of Investigations. During

   my 4 years with the department, there were several reorganisations where the

   teams were moved into different geographical areas and therefore a restructure of

   the reporting lines.



13. I did not play any part in the development and/or management of the policies

   listed in point 11.



14.1 cannot recall the specific policies adhered to but as a Designated Prosecuting

   Authority the department was governed by Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984

   (PACE) and the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 regarding

   disclosure rules. There were also internal documents which were circulated and

   adhered to, however, I cannot remember what they were some 15 years

   previously. The only noticeable change I can recall was the introduction of

   Financial Investigators and the recovery of monies through the Proceeds of Crime

   Act 2002 (POCA).



15. 1 have been asked to consider the email sent to myself from Dave Posnett and

   others. (POL00123309). Having viewed the document, I cannot see my name on

   the circulation list and I note the date the email was sent, that being 9th July 2014

   was some 6 years after I left the company. I have therefore not reviewed the

   attachments (POL00123310), (POL00038728), or (POL00123312). I also note the

   email chain originated from Mick Matthews, so presume you have mistaken my

   name instead of his. I therefore have no comment to make regarding this

   question.

                                                                                        WITN08330100




16. I have been asked what the process was for dealing with complaints about the

   conduct of an investigation by the Security team. I do not recall ever being

   involved in or consulted over this issue. I have never been the subject of a

   complaint made during my 32 year career within the Royal Mail Group.



17. With regards to supervision over criminal investigations, from my recollection, I

   had regular interactions with my line managers and peers over the development

   and progression of investigations and any areas which need to be addressed.

   There was also conversations with the casework management team and direction

   from the Legal team.



18. From my recollection, there was no difference in the investigations I undertook

   between Crown Office staff and Subpostmasters. I treated each one exactly the

   same, evidence based, and reported up to the relevant individuals in exactly the

   same manner. I cannot comment on if there was any different strategies adopted

   from a higher level than me. My approach did not change over my time with Post

   Office Limited with the exception of consideration given to POCA.



   Audit and Investigation



19.I have been asked to consider the document "Condensed Guide for Audit

   Attendance" (Version 2, October 2008) (POL00104821). I have never seen this

   document as it was created after I had left the business. I therefore have no

   comment to make with regards to this document


                                      Page 6 of 40
                                                                                          WI TNO8330100
                                                                                       WITNO8330100




20.As an investigator, I would attend an audit if the auditors on site, after verifying the

   cash and stock on hand, reported a large loss or if the Counter

   Clerk/Subpostmaster volunteered the cash declared was inflated by a significant

   amount. Another reason for attendance would be if the Investigator had requested

   the audit due to anomalies in the accounts. This could also be from information

   from another department for example Cash Management where an office would

   be ordering cash despite having declared in excess of what the office needed.

   The investigators role on these occasions would be a watching brief until the audit

   was completed with interaction with the staff involved.



21.After a shortfall was identified following an audit, I cannot recall who made the

   decision on whether the Post Office Investigators would be involved. There were

   thresholds on amounts which would trigger involvement but I cannot recall what

   they were. The involvement of the Financial Investigators, from my recollection,

   was down to the amount of loss, possibly with previous reported incidents being

   taken into account. I cannot recall if this changed during my 4 years with the team

   from 2004 to 2008.



22.The local Contract Manager would be involved in conversations regarding the

   branch but I cannot recall if they could influence any decision re next steps. This

   conversation would be undertaken at a higher level than me.



23. I cannot recall what the triggers were from raising a fraud case following a

   shortfall or discrepancy at a branch. I believe several factors would impact on next


                                        Page 7 of 40
                                                                                         W ITNO8330100
                                                                                        WITN08330100




   steps taken including the amount of the loss, including any previous losses or

   concerns.



24.1 have been asked what process the Security Team Investigators followed in

   conducting an investigation. From my recollection, the process was to obtain

   accounts/statements from relevant persons, analyse the data available including

   transaction logs, log on/log off records, attendance and annual leave records etc.

   Follow up any lines of enquiry or possible evidence to prove or disprove the

   allegations. This would be done in line with all legal guidelines including but not

   limited to Data Protection Act 1998, Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and

   also the internal Post Office Limited guidelines for dealing with such matters.



25.The decision to prosecute was made by the Post Office Criminal Law Team and

   the Head of Post Office Security. I cannot comment if the Local Contract Manager

   had any input or influence in legal decisions as I was not involved at that level.



26.1 have been asked what test was applied by those making prosecution and

   charging decisions. I cannot answer this as I was not involved in these areas.

   Furthermore, I hold no legal qualifications and have no expertise in these areas.



27. In terms of what advice the investigator provided the legal team, this was by way

   of a Suspect Offender report which detailed the individual, the alleged offence, the

   investigation and any supporting evidential material. On occasions, not always, a

   conversation would take place between the investigator and the assigned lawyer




                                       Page 8 of 40
                                                                                         WI TNO8330100
                                                                                     WITN08330100




   regarding the case but in my experience this was to discuss any further evidence

   required and/or to inform me of the outcome.



28. I have been asked in what circumstances were steps to restrain a suspect's

   assets by criminal enforcement methods such as confiscation proceedings

   considered. Post Office Limited employed Financial Investigators to deal with

   these types of situations, however, I believe there was a threshold amount of a

   shortage which would trigger their involvement. I cannot recall what this amount

   was but it was around £15k. The decision to pursue this method of recovery lay

   with the Financial Investigators, maybe with involvement with the Head of

   Security.



   Training, Instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security

   Team



29. I received training with regards to all aspects of interviewing individuals suspected

   of a criminal offence, statement taking, searching, the role of an investigator and

   obtaining, reviewing and disclosing evidence. This was by way of a 6 week initial

   intensive training course at the start of my tenure with the department and

   subsequent ad hoc workshops either as a refresher or when there were significant

   changes to either legislation or working arrangements within Casework

   Management.



30. I have been asked whether and in what circumstances evidence should be sought

   from third parties who might hold relevant evidence and in particular, Fujitsu,


                                       Page 9 of 40
                                                                                           WI TNO8330100
                                                                                       WITNO8330100




   where shortfalls were identified in branch. In the investigations I undertook I

   followed the evidence trail and I would seek information from relevant

   departments where needed for example, cash management teams and Helpline

   departments. With regards to Fujitsu, I believe there were protocols to follow

   should you require their assistance, I cannot recall exactly the process but having

   viewed the documentation provided to me, I believe it was via an ARQ request via

   the Casework Team.




31. I have been asked what instructions, guidance and/or training I received regarding

   an Investigator's disclosure obligations. Disclosure of evidence was part of the

   initial training on joining the Security function. I also recall attending a workshop

   where it was covered.



32. Instructions were given on drafting investigation reports which were subject to

   scrutiny by the Casework team prior to being forwarded to the Criminal Law team

   for consideration. At the start of my 4 year tenure, in 2004, my work was mainly

   checking pension dockets and inflated submissions by counter clerks. I did not

   compile many reports whilst undertaking this responsibility as I was mainly doing

   the background work for the Lead investigator in the case. I believe my

   subsequent reports were scrutinised by my peers and Line Manager prior to

   submission to the Casework Team.



33.1 have been asked to consider the document entitled " The Casework

   Management document" (POL00104747) (version 1.0 March 2000) and


                                      Page 10 of 40
                                                                                        WI TNO8330100
                                                                                       WITNO8330100




   (POL00104777) (version 4.0 October 2002). I cannot recall being provided with

   either of these documents when I joined the Security team in 2004. I believe I may

   have seen something similar on my training course or from the document

   database which I referred to during my time in this role. I cannot state if these

   were the exact versions.



34.1 have been asked what I understood by the bullet points on page 2 of the

   Casework Management. I have reviewed the October 2002 version

   (POL00104777) as it is highly likely the previous version from March 2000 had

   been superseded when I joined in 2004. The first 3 bullet points on page 2 are

   regarding the documents required to be associated in any casefile and that all

   casefiles go in the first instance to the Prosecution Support Office.



35. With regards to bullet point 4 on page 2 concerning failures in operational

   procedures and security, my recollections on this are anything you observed or

   encountered which played a part in a fraud being committed or loss in an office.

   This could be due to a system problem, for example allowing an uncapped

   number of deposits into an A&L account, procedural issue for example paper

   pension dockets being inflated which less than 5% were subject to random

   scrutiny at the processing centre in Lisahally, Northern Ireland, or a security issue

   for example a malfunction of a safe or the fact the clerk keeps excess cash in the

   draw. These are examples where the business would not want these details to

   become common knowledge.

36. I do recall compliance checks being undertaken on my files. I cannot remember if

   this was in force prior to joining the team or whilst I was there (2004 to 2008). I

   believe it was introduced to improve the standard of the files and try and

   standardise the submissions across all teams. It did not change anything I did, I

   just used it as a guide to ensure I had completed the tasks. My recollection is this

   was undertaken by the Casework Team in Croydon however there were several

   people in that department and I cannot remember whose responsibility it was. I

   played no role in the development of the Casework Management documentation.




37. 1 have been asked to consider an email from David Posnett dated 23 May 2011

   (POL00118096) and the associated documents (POL00118096) (POL00118109)

   (POL00118101) (P0L00118102) (P0L00118103) (P0L00118104) (P0L00118105)

   Limited for some 3 years and therefore not included on the circulation of this email

   or had sight of the associated documents, I cannot comment as to the status of

   the suite of compliance documents at the times they were circulated nor the

   purpose of the documents.

   any Post Office Limited Security policies, procedures or guidelines. This includes

   any involvement in the document entitled "Identification Codes" (POL00118104)

40. My understanding of why Security Team investigators were instructed to assign

   identification codes to suspected offenders was to align with the details required

   when completing an antecedents documents and align the details to those

   required for input onto the Police National Database should a case reach that

   stage.



41.1 have been asked what analysis was done by Security team investigators of

   Horizon data when a Subpostmaster/managerlassistant attributed the shortfall to

   problems with Horizon. The claim made by Mr Thomas that an intermittent

   electrical issue caused problems with the On-Line banking withdrawals on his

   Horizon system, was the first time I had heard a claim that a loss was due to a

   fault with the system, and when I left in 2008, it remained the only investigation I

   led or had involvement with in which similar claims were made. I investigated Mr

   Thomas's claims and requested the Horizon data. From my recollection, the data

   was in an excel spreadsheet. I then analysed this information to look for

   anomalies and patterns. I also asked Fujitsu via the Casework team, to undertake

   checks at their end and I also had the equipment removed to be checked. I cannot

   comment what other investigators did or what the Post Office instructed

   investigators to do after 2008.



42.I have been asked to give an explanation of the contractual obligations of Fujitsu

   to provide data. I do not know what the contract with Fujitsu was, only that I

   requested data for specific times and information and received it. I knew there

   were limits on how many requests could be made to Fujitsu each month without

   having to pay for it so each application was scrutinised on its own merits. I played

   no part in this process apart from make an application. I also do not know who

   was responsible from Fujitsu to provide the data or any subsequent support

   offered as part of the contract. I did receive data and cannot be 100% sure but

   believe it was on CD discs.



43. I do not know if ARQ data was requested from Fujitsu as a matter of course

   regarding shortfalls identified which the Subpostmaster or clerk attributed to the

   Horizon system. I was not involved in this process. I do not know if the ARQ data

   was provided to Subpostmasters as a matter of course. If obtained, it should form

   part of the disclosure package.



44.1 cannot recall the names of Gareth Jenkins or Penny Thomas, however, I do

   recall seeking assistance on one occasion with individuals from Fujitsu regarding

   obtaining data, checking the integrity of a system and providing statements.

45. I do not recall Gareth Jenkins and I do not know if he was an expert witness for

   Fujitsu. From the documentation provided, this may well have been the case.



   Involvement in Criminal Prosecution Case Studies



   Prosecution of Janet Skinner



46.1 have been asked a series of questions regarding the POL v Janet Skinner case

   and wish to clarify that I had very little recollection of this case but have been

   aided by referring to the documentation provided by this inquiry. My answers will

   be from the documents provided as much as my own clear recollections.



47.On Tuesday 301h May 2006, I received information regarding a substantial loss at

   North Bransholme Post Office in the Hull area. I am unsure if this communication

   was from my Line Manager who I believe was Paul Dawkins or from Mrs Hoyles,

   Rural Support Officer. Following this an audit was undertaken which confirmed the

   total loss amount which I believe I would have been informed of.



48. On the day of the audit, after confirmation of the outcome, arrangements were

   made with Miss Skinner to undertake a tape recorded interview. From the List Of

   Exhibits (POL00047368), I refer to SB/1 "Copy of notebook entry of conversation

   with Janet Skinner 31/05/2006 at 09:58 hours. I am assuming the telephone call

   was made by Investigator Stephen Bradshaw. From the Summary of Tape

   Recorded Interview (POL00044632) an entry was made at 11:53 part of which

   states " Notebook entry by SB read out regarding arrangements made for JS to

                                                                                         WITNO8330100




   attend a voluntary interview. Legal rights explained. JS confirms it/s an accurate

   account of the conversation"



49. Accompanied by Stephen Bradshaw, on Thursday 1St June 2006 I travelled to

   North Bransholme Post Office and met Miss Skinner. As is standard procedure,

   Miss Skinner was cautioned and the offer to seek legal advice if she required,

   and/or a union representative or a friend to be present was reiterated and the

   relevant forms completed and signed by Miss Skinner. From my recollections,

   Miss Skinner declined both. (DM/1 "Copy of Legal rights form signed by J Skinner"

   on List Of Exhibits (POL00047368) and "Form CS003 friends at interview form J

   Skinner 1/06/2006" on Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material

   (POL00048259).



50.I recall starting the interview in her premises, however, there was a problem with

   the tape machine. The tapes were sealed up and I obtained authority from the

   local police station to use a room and their facilities to conduct the interview. I

   don't believe Miss Skinner was ever arrested or placed in custody, we were just

   using their facilities in an administrative room which had a tape machine in. A

   notebook entry detailing the issues with the Tape Machine was made and entered

   on the Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material.



51. My role in this investigation was to investigate the loss in question and obtain any

   evidence relating to it. This could mean exploring several avenues of enquiry as

   the investigation evolves. When I was in possession of all relevant documentation,

   I completed an Investigation report.

                                                                                      WITNO8330100




52. Statements were taken from POL employees from cash handling and the

   identification of the loss as well as other staff members working at North

   Bransholme Post Office.



53.1 do not recall Miss Skinner making any allegations relating to the reliability of the

   Horizon system at any stage of the investigation. I have referred to the 3

   documents titled " Summary of Tape Recorded Interview" (POL00044632,

   POL00044633 and POL00044656) and cannot find any evidence of Miss Skinner

   offering the Horizon system as a potential reason for the losses. Miss Skinner

   stated she believed mistakes were being made by her staff and/or one of her staff

   members was stealing and on POL00044632 at 33:15 goes into detail regarding

   this.



54. Miss Skinner was asked if she would agree to a voluntary search of her home

   address which she declined at that time as she had young children who would be

   at home. As was procedure at the time, I would relay this to my Line Manager to

   check on next steps. I was asked to contact the local Police Station for

   assistance. As I was already at the Police Station I spoke to an officer who said

   they had manpower issues and they could not help. I did not ask Miss Skinner

   again.



55. I have been asked to consider documents POL00048161 and POL00048168 in

   relation to my involvement in the decision to charge and prosecute Miss Skinner. I

   can state that I had no involvement in this decision. I have no legal training and


                                       Page 17 of 40
                                                                                          WI TN08330100
                                                                                       WITNO8330100




   my involvement is to collate and present the facts and pass it to the Legal team

   for consideration. The Legal team alongside the Head of Security would make

   those decisions.



56.As is the same with all prosecution cases, I would have to present my documents

   in the form of a committal bundle and ensure they are placed on the relevant

   paperwork with regards to used/unused/sensitive material. Any additional material

   required by the assigned lawyer would be obtained or addressed although the

   majority of time this was only required should the subject plead not guilty. I would

   then forward the paperwork bundle back to the lawyer for them to scrutinise and

   do whatever they needed to do with it. Any summonses would be sent to the

   investigator to issue however, from the documents provided, I believe I wasn't

   involved in that process in this case.



57. With regards to the witness statements, I spoke to the individuals and drafted an

   account of the discussion which took place. This was read and checked by the

   person named before signing as accurate. Any handwritten notes made in the

   drafting of the statements were included on the Schedule of Non-Sensitive

   Unused Material (POL00048259).



58. I was not the disclosure officer in this case or any cases. The decision on what

   was disclosed was a legal matter and dealt with by the Prosecution Support Team.

   I submitted all documents to them on the relevant paperwork and I played no

   further part in the dissemination of the evidence.

59. From my recollections, I believe I had a discussion with the assigned lawyer

   regarding the theft charge against Miss Skinner. This was due to my belief that the

   evidence proved inconclusive as to what had happened to the missing money.

   The decision in all cases is made by the lawyers as the experts in this area.



60.I have been asked how the circumstances surrounding the suspension and

   dismissal of Mrs Lyell impacted the case strategy against Miss Skinner and also

   my views of the merits of the case against her. I cannot answer the question

   regarding strategy of the case as I was not part of any discussion, my role was to

   forward the information onto the legal team and assigned lawyer. My view of the

   merits of the case did not change as I did not conclude who, if anyone had stolen

   the money.



61. I have been asked the details of the discussion which I was party to at the plea

   and case management hearing and the reasons why a plea to false accounting

   was acceptable. Firstly, I cannot remember any exact details from the hearing,

   however, from the document "Letter from Myer Wolf Solicitors dated 8th January

   2007 (POL00048407), I note the discussion where I was named was following a

   discussion from counsel with Head Office on the morning of the hearing. From my

   best recollections and as is normal practise in my experience of court hearings,

   discussions took place between the prosecution and defence barristers with the

   prosecution barrister having already been in contact with and been given direction

   from the instructing lawyer. I would have been informed at this point what was

   agreed. These were not discussions where I would have any influence on. I note

   my discussion was with prosecution counsel and instructed solicitors, both legally

   trained individuals where as I am not.



62. I played no part in the confiscation proceedings, this was undertaken by trained

   Financial Investigators. Some information provided by Miss Skinner as part of the

   antecedents (POL00048013) and featuring in the report would have been passed

   to the Financial Investigator although I believe they have their own channels for

   obtaining financial information.




63. I played no further part in this case.



64. I have been asked what my reflections are now on the way the investigation and

   prosecution of Alison Hall was conducted by the Post Office and the outcome of

   the case. I was not involved in nor have ever heard or read anything about Alison

   Hall's case, I therefore have no comments to make on this.



65. Having read the evidence given to the inquiry by Janet Skinner (INO00001035) I

   wish to make the following comments. It is my recollection that Miss Skinner did

   not make any reference to the Horizon system being to blame for her losses.

   Having read through all the documents provided to me, especially the Interview

   transcripts, I cannot see it ever being offered as a possible explanation by Miss

   Skinner.

                                                                                          WITNO8330100




66.1 requested and received Horizon data discs ARQ123 and ARQ124 which are

   listed on the List of Exhibits (POL00047368). From my recollections, the dates

   coincided with losses and I requested the data for look at anomalies, large

   transactions or movement of cash and look at each counter clerks transactions in

   isolation for anything suspicious.



67. From my best recollections, as in all cases with large losses, I would contact the

   Helpline for any calls relating to the office experiencing losses. I did not receive

   any call logs back from them. I did not find this unusual as in her interview Miss

   Skinner was asked if she called anyone for help with her losses and replied No,

   stating her reason for not contacting anyone is because she would then have to

   pay it back. Summary of Tape Recorded Interview (POL00044632) at 23:12

   refers. If there were any indications from Miss Skinner that she did engage with

   the Helpline for this reason or due to Horizon faults then the logs would be more

   comprehensive and I would have expected to receive data. A considerable

   number of the calls made by this Post Office would have been in relation to the

   numerous changes to the cash remittances due.



68. My views in this case have not changed in one respect. I was not convinced Miss

   Skinner had stolen the money and there was no evidence to prove she had. I was

   therefore unhappy with a Theft charge and conveyed this at the time to the

   assisting lawyer. I felt Miss Skinner had lost control of the office and was too

   trusting of her staff despite knowing one had a large loss she was repaying and

   also with a background of family issues. Miss Skinner was absent for a lot of the

                                                                                          WI TN08330100
                                                                                     WITNO8330100




   time and gave her staff keys to the office and safe despite the losses growing.

   She didn't want to upset or offend them.



69.At the time of this investigation, I was not aware of any other complaints or

   challenges regarding the integrity of the Horizon system. The losses Miss Skinner

   was experiencing were rising at an alarming level, sometimes £7k in a week and it

   is unusual for counter clerks to steal at this level as they know repercussions will

   occur. On Hindsight, knowing now the problems that have been highlighted, the

   Horizon system seems like a feasible cause of the losses Miss Skinner

   experienced.




70. With regards to False Accounting, on face value, this appeared a valid charge,

   however, if the losses were created by a system whose integrity cannot be relied

   upon and which attempts have been made to hide this or minimise the impact,

   then both the counter clerks and Investigators were experiencing and

   investigating issues that were never going to resolved. To that end, having read

   the Judgement of the Court of Appeal (POL00113278) paras 190 to 193, it maybe

   that justice has been done for Miss Skinner.



   Prosecution of Hughie Noel Thomas



71.1 have been asked to describe the circumstances in which I became involved in

   the case involving Mr Thomas. I recall receiving a phone call from Stephen

   Bradshaw informing me our Line Manager Paul Dawkins, had contacted him


                                      Page 22 of 40
                                                                                          WI TN08330100
                                                                                     WITNO8330100




   stating that an audit team was on site at Gaerwen Post Office in North Wales and

   had encountered a large cash shortage. Stephen Bradshaw asked me to attend

   with him to investigate the loss and undertake an interview with the

   Subpostmaster Mr Thomas.



72. Whilst en route to the office, we received a phone call from Mr Emlyn Hughes,

   Contracts Manager, informing us that Gaerwen Post Office had had a previous

   loss of around £11,000 which Mr Thomas's daughter was responsible for. Mr

   Hughes said he had allowed Mr Thomas to keep the Post Office on the proviso

   that the money was repaid and his daughter did not have anything to do with the

   Post Office. Mr Hughes said he had suspicions the money had not been repaid

   and the situation may have repeated itself and compounded the losses.

   Subsequent documents produced in this case make reference to Mr Hughes

   comments, the documents are "Post Office Ltd Confidential — Investigation

   Personnel report" (POL00044861) and Terms of Reference for the Criminal

   Investigation" (POL00047748)



73. My role in the investigation was to confirm the audit shortage, introduce myself to

   Mr Thomas and explain why we were there, what we wanted to do and how we

   proceed. This was dependant on a number of factors, mainly the Health and

   Safety of the auditors and Investigators in what are always difficult and tense

   situations. Being in the Subpostmaster's premises and also his home with his

   family and friend present poses risks and the situation has to be dynamically risk

   assessed. Always at the forefront of my mind was a situation in the Chester area

   in 1999 where an Investigator was shot and killed and colleagues injured by a

   Royal Mail Group employee whilst undertaking a search of his house.



74. I was also responsible for any follow up actions and the reporting of the case to

   Mr Hughes, as he would be considering Mr Thomas's status as a Subpostmaster

   and also the Post Office legal team. I note the report which I have been forwarded

   titled "Investigation- Personnel" (POL00044861). This was the report purely for Mr

   Hughes and prepared soon after the audit and prior to some of the follow up

   actions being undertaken. A far more detailed report at the conclusion of the

   investigation was prepared and forwarded to the lawyers titled Investigation-

   Legal. I have not been provided with the document to assist in this inquiry.



75. I have been asked to consider Mr Thomas's evidence to the enquiry in

   IN000001044 pages 135 to 160 and provide any observations.



76. Page 141 Mr Thomas was asked:

          "You said you had an audit in 2004

          "Yes"

          "if that one went ok"

          "yes".



   It is my recollection, that this audit in 2004 discovered a loss of £11,000 attributed

   to misappropriation by Mr Thomas's daughter, as mentioned by Mr Emlyn Hughes

   in point 72 and referred to in documents "Post Office Ltd Confidential —

   Investigation Personnel report" (POL00044861) and Terms of Reference for the

   Criminal Investigation" (POL00047748). The October 2005 audit was a planned

   one, which had to take place within 12 months of the previous audit, due to a

   previous loss being recorded.



77. Page 142, Mr Thomas stated:

        "They hoovered my office, I didn't have a shred of paper left, even my

        council work went. Everything went".



   I was responsible for the evidence gathering of the paperwork. I seized the weekly

   envelopes containing the paperwork generated by the Horizon system as well as

   Horizon generated paperwork from the auditors on the day. That is all I was

   interested in and was quite substantial. No search was ever undertaken of Mr

   Thomas's private living areas or retail shop. Only the Post Office area was ever

   searched. I did not see or remove anything to do with Mr Thomas's council work

   nor did I come across anything non Post Office related when I went through the

   documentation. I can also state that the Investigation team played no part in

   clearing his office of any stock or taking the keys off him.



78.On Page 143 Mr Thomas stated:

         "a lady came in, and a gentleman with her. The lady was quite robust.

        She wanted to interview me on my own. I refused"



   I wish to clarify that I do not recall my behaviour to be robust and I have never

   been described in that manner either before or since. I was walking into a very

   difficult situation where Mr Thomas was rightly upset and was angry and raising

   his voice. My first priority is to try and calm the situation and explain in a

   methodical manner, why I was there and what I needed to do.



79.At no point did I ask Mr Thomas to be interviewed alone, in all situations, I would

   prefer to have somebody present to oversee proceedings, this is to help all

   parties. Mr Thomas would have been offered a friend to be present and also for

   him to seek free and independent legal advice and I would assist him to do this if

   he so wished. Mr Thomas asked for Mr Jim Evans to be present at an interview,

   however, this was deemed inappropriate at the time as Mr Evans was now the

   interim subpostmaster for this office.



80.On page 143, Mr Thomas has stated:



         "She said they had to go outside and make a couple of telephone calls

         and within half an hour two policemen arrived. She walked through the

         door and she said "Cuff him, he's a thief".



   I find this comment outrageous for many reasons. It is for the Police to decide how

   they deal with suspect offenders. I did not ask them to do this nor have I ever

   used the words "cuff him", it's like something out of a Police TV programme, It's

   not real life. I never use the word "cuff". I was also informed by Mr Thomas, prior

   to the Police arriving, that he is friends with the Police and they frequent his office

   regularly for tea and biscuits as they are only a few doors away. I knew the Police

   would not consider Mr Thomas a threat or that he would be non-compliant with

   their requests and I never even considered there would be a need to restrain him.


                                       Page 26 of 40

                                                                                  WITNO8330100




   These comments are completely untrue. I have done numerous investigations

   which involved the Police regarding employees or Subpostmasters and handcuffs

   have never been used. At this stage, I also knew that other members of Mr

   Thomas's family, including his daughter, had active user accounts on the system

   and therefore, it was believed the loss may have been due to the loss in 2004 not

   having been made good and the problem continuing. Therefore at this stage, I did

   not consider Mr Thomas to be a thief.



81.On Page 144 Mr Thomas states the Police answered:



         "No lam not going to cuff him" and "Noel will find his own way to

         Holyhead Police Station for an interview".



   The police did not make the first part of the statement as the request was never

   made. With regards to the second part of the statement, the Police Officers and

   Mr Thomas were conversing in Welsh which neither myself or Mr Bradshaw speak

   or understand. We were not informed that Mr Thomas had not been arrested at

   this point, and were asked to make our way to Holyhead Police station believing

   they would transport Mr Thomas there. It was only when we were at the custody

   suite that we were informed Mr Thomas was attending on a voluntary basis.



82. Mr Thomas has described me as aggressive. I do not consider my behaviour to be

   aggressive at all. I remember being quite overwhelmed with Mr Thomas attitude

   towards me as he was very loud and angry but could understand that as it was a

   really stressful situation for him.

                                                                                      WITNO8330100




83.On page 144 Mr Thomas stated I was aggressive with the custody sergeant in

   charge and wanting him put in a cell, against stating:



         "first of all, she wanted me cuffed and thankfully again, l knew one of

         the Policemen and he said no "



   This did not happen. This was one of my first occasions when I had to attend a

   Police Station to interview a suspect and the explanation of the background and

   necessity for the situation we were in was undertaken by Stephen Bradshaw who

   liaised with the Custody Sergeant. I was observing at this point and I had a

   pleasant normal interaction with them. I have attended Police stations on

   numerous times since, possibly over 50, and when I go into a Custody suite, I do

   as I am told by the Custody Sergeant and their staff, the same as the suspect.

   The Custody Sergeant will then agree a course of action and I abide by this in all

   cases. In my experience it is absolutely normal for suspects to be placed into a

   cell whilst awaiting a solicitor or to be interviewed. This is decided by them and I

   certainly played no part in Mr Thomas being placed into a cell.



84. Mr Thomas stated the interview lasted 6 hours. This is not my recollection at all,

   nothing like. From checking the documents "Summary of Tape Recorded

   Interview" (POL00044864) it is noted the interview lasted 46 minutes and 1 set of

   tapes. Mr Thomas may have been in the Police Station for this length of time, I am

   not sure. Mr Thomas arrived around 18:00 hours and at 19:52 the interview

   started and at 20:36 the interview ended. I remember waiting for Mr Thomas's


                                      Page 28 of 40
                                                                                          WI TN08330100
                                                                                     WITNO8330100




   Legal Representative to arrive, then we gave disclosure. Following this Mr

   Thomas had a consultation with his solicitor. I remember clearly, myself and

   Stephen Bradshaw were asked to approach the desk and speak with the Custody

   Sergeant who informed us a request was made by Mr Thomas's solicitor for the

   interview to be undertaken in the Welsh language. We were happy to comply but

   an interpreter would be required. The Custody Sergeant then asked if Mr Thomas

   had been conversing in English during the day to which we both replied yes. We

   were recalled back approx. 15 minutes later to inform us they had declined the

   solicitors request as he agreed Mr Thomas understanding of English was good

   and therefore the interview would proceed in English.




85.Mr Thomas stated "I wanted him". I am taking that as meaning I wanted him to

   admit or wanted him be guilty at all costs. I can state that this was never the case.

   As with all interviews, I have to ask difficult and challenging questions and I want

   the suspect to be able to give their account and if there are mitigating

   circumstances then I will investigate them. From reading the "Summary of Tape

   Recorded Interview" (POL00044864), I do not think my questioning reflects me

   "wanting him". I never received any challenge from Mr Thomas's solicitor, Mr

   Williams, and on the final page Mr Williams is asked "Are you happy the interview

   has been conducted in accordance with PACE" to which he relies "Yes I'm sure".

   Also, as is reflected in the same document, Stephen Bradshaw led the majority of

   the questioning as at this time I was fairly inexperienced.

86. I have been asked to describe the nature of the Police involvement in this

   investigation. Gaerwen Police station was located around 50 to 100 yards away

   from Mr Thomas's Post Office. We had a conversation with Mr Thomas about that

   and he stated he knew the Police Officers and they would often call in for tea and

   biscuits.



87.The situation within the Post Office was quite tense. Both myself and Stephen

   Bradshaw were asking questions to both the auditors and Mr Thomas who

   appeared angry, understandably. The request was made to interview Mr Thomas

   and he suggested he was accompanied by Mr Evans as discussed above. I went

   outside and called my Line Manager Mr Dawkins to update him on the situation

   and take guidance as to the next steps. I was told to contact the Police as they

   were yards away and seek assistance from them. I do not know Mr Dawkins's

   rationale for this as he made the decision but I do know some of it was due to the

   risks to Post Office staff and not wanting the situation there to escalate into

   something worse as had happened previously.



88. When the Police arrived it was very clear they knew Mr Thomas and his family

   personally. They were talking in Welsh and laughing, I do not know what was said.

   I cannot remember if myself or Stephen Bradshaw spoke to the Police and

   explained what we were looking to do which was interview Mr Thomas. The Police

   agreed to assist and we believed Mr Thomas was being arrested and a

   subsequent search of his home would be undertaken. The police had a further

   conversation with Mr Thomas, in Welsh and I believed it was being explained to

   him what we had just discussed. It was a couple of hours later, upon arrival into


                                      Page 30 of 40

                                                                                    WITNO8330100




   Holyhead Custody Suite that I was informed Mr Thomas had not been arrested as

   he had been allowed to voluntarily attend. We were also informed no search had

   been undertaken.



89.1 have been asked to consider FUJ00155181, FUJ00152563, POL00068342 and

   POL00063813 regarding any contact I had with Fujitsu. I emailed Graham Ward

   from the Casework Team requesting some assistance from Fujitsu to try and

   substantiate, or not, Mr Thomas's claims about the Horizon issues. I received data

   from them, I think as part of an ARQ request. I have not had sight of the exhibits

   list to refresh my memory but presume the transactions re withdrawal data for

   incorrect PIN etc came from them.




90. From my recollection, I did not have any direct communication with Penny

   Thomas or Gareth Edwards apart from to manage them as witnesses in the case

   for example dates to avoid, dates required in court etc.



91.The email POL00068342 refers to me meeting Brian Pinder, Head of Fujitsu on

   Monday 19th December 2005 to oversee the removal of the Horizon equipment. I

   did meet somebody from Fujitsu when the equipment was removed by cannot

   recall his name, I presume it was Mr Pinder. The reason for this is Mr Thomas

   stated the equipment was faulty and I insisted on it being checked. I was not

   comfortable with an Interim Subpostmaster opening the Post Office with the same

   equipment as they may experience the same issues Mr Thomas had reported and

   experience losses and I thought that would not be right.

92.1 have been asked to provide details of my understanding of the allegations made

   by Mr Thomas relating to the Horizon system and what the significance of this

   was. From my recollections, Mr Thomas stated his electricity is affected when

   wagons or HGV's pass his office causing online card withdrawal transactions to

   not be registered.



93.1 have been asked if the call logs from Mr Thomas to the Horizon Service desk or

   NBSC for the relevant period were ever requested by anyone involved in the

   prosecution of Mr Allen. Firstly, I do not know who Mr Allen is on any investigation

   associated with during my tenure with POL. Secondly, the call logs were

   requested for Mr Thomas and Gaewen Post Office and are associated as part of

   FUJ00155181. From my best recollection, the call logs for 2005 were requested

   and received on 14th October 2005, the day after the audit and subsequent

   interview with Mr Thomas. It was noted that the only call pertaining to issues with

   the Horizon system was made after the arrival of the auditors on 13th October

   2005. The caller who was identified as the PM "Some On-Line banking PIN

   withdrawals are zero value on the On-Line banking report by Pin and the PM

   wants someone to explain this to him".



94. Regarding the removal of equipment from Gaerwen Post Office, please see point

   no: 91



95.1 have been asked about my involvement in the decision to charge Mr Thomas. I

   did not play any part in this decision or any subsequent arrangements made

   between both sets of Legal teams. I was there to undertake the administrative

   parts for example witness management.



96.AII evidence and supporting paperwork and documentation would have been

   forwarded to the Prosecution Office and advising lawyer for their advice. The

   subsequent evidence bundle would be compiled by them. I do not recall providing

   any further evidence. As stated in point 74, 1 did compile an Investigation Report —

   Legal which would have been much more in depth and contained evidence

   gathering which was done after the audit and interview. I have not been provided

   with this document to review.




97. 1 have been asked to consider documents FUJ00152587, FUJ00152635 and

   FUJ00152641. I recall meeting somebody at the Post Office to remove the

   equipment and presume from the documents this was Brian Pinder. I think Gareth

   Jenkins was a Fujitsu expert on Horizon and Penny Thomas was the contact for

   obtaining Horizon data. I have never met Gareth Thomas or Penny Thomas and

   my interaction with them was regarding their witness availability. All other

   requests were made via the Casework Management Team who would be the

   interface into all requests made to Fujitsu.



98. With regards to the request for a statement from Gareth Jenkins, I would have

   asked the Casework Team for a statement regarding the Fujitsu involvement and

   it would be the Casework Management Team who would go via their agreed

    channels and obtain this, with Gareth Jenkins offered by Fujitsu as their subject

    matter expert. I was not involved in this process apart from ask for a statement.



 99. I was not the disclosure officer in this case. This was undertaken by the

    Prosecution Support Office.



100. I did not review the prosecution decision or review the indictment. I was sent the

    advice which is from the Legal experts, which I am not.



101. I have been asked about a conversation I had with Mr Pinder as on FUJ00152635

    relating to a conditional plea by Mr Thomas that "Horizon in no way played a part

    in this loss". I do not recollect this conversation, however, from the documents I

    can recall it was proving difficult to arrange for Mr Jenkins to commit to a date to

    attend the upcoming trial and I was in constant communication with him via email.

    With Mr Jenkins being based down South and Caernarfon Crown Court being a

    considerable logistical commute for him, I was relaying the advice received from

    Juliet McFarlane, advising POL Lawyer and ratified on document POL00048201.

    Mr Pinder would let his Fujitsu team member know accordingly.



102. I had no discussion with Mr Thomas regarding the basis of plea being "Horizon in

    no way played a part in this loss". This was undertaken at a much higher level

    than myself between the prosecution and Defence parties. I was informed of the

    outcome.

103. 1 have been asked about my comment on FUJ00152650 "Mr Thomas was not

    expecting a custodial sentence and although not a particularly long sentence, it

    does send out the right message". The first part of the sentence was made due to

    a conversation in court where the prosecuting barrister said both parties expected

    a suspended sentence. We were all shocked when the judge gave his sentencing

    submissions especially given the character references provided and read out in

    court. With regards to the last part of the sentence, this was a quote from the POL

    communications department which I cut and pasted.



104. I played no part in any subsequent proceedings against Mr Thomas or had any

    further involvement in the case.




    General



 105. I have been asked on my reflections on the way the investigation and

     prosecution of Alison Hall was conducted. I have no recollection of being

     involved in any case against this person so cannot comment.



 106. 1 have also been asked my views on POL00113278 para's 149 to 155 and I have

     no comment to make that I have not already delivered in this statement.



 107. When I left POL in 2008, the issue of the Horizon system having bugs and its

     integrity were just starting to be raised. I did not become involved in this whilst in


                                       Page 35 of 40

    POL and where raised as mitigation in my investigation, I followed the process

    and raised the issues. The evidence has shown in some instances, there are

    clearly issues and if these have been covered up then everybody associated

    with this period has been working against a backdrop of false information. The

    high level decision makers need to answer for their actions.



108. I cannot comment regarding information passed to POL from Fujitsu as I was not

    involved in this process.



109. Clearly, as an investigator gathering evidence to show how/why losses occurred,

    if I did not have the right data or knew there were bugs or defects then I am not

    reporting the true state of affairs. I feel this is especially relevant to the case

    against Miss Janet Skinner although she did not suggest Horizon as an issue,

    the system defects should have been highlighted as part of Fujitsu/POL

    safeguards for losses that are growing at a pace like they were at Bransholme

    Post Office.



110. I have no further comments to make or matters to bring to the attention of the

    chair of the inquiry.



Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
