2 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Programme Status Live Outlets Operational Counters

29'" February 2000

Comments
Overall call volumes have increased inline with the predicted volumes given the volume of Outlets migrated
during the month,

The improvement initiatives introduced into the HSH call handling processes for Level 1 and Level 2 type
calls are now becoming effective. There was a significant improvement shown in HSH call handling for Level
1 for February. Monitoring and improvement will continue.

System Service achievement generally fell this month. Investigation into the reasons has highlighted two
process issues. One with diagnosis of hardware faults within SMC and the other with the dispatching of
engineers to Post Offices, Both issues are being addressed to ensure the service levels improve during March.

Business Incidents and Cash Account Help Desk Services are now being monitored against SLAs following
the 3“! Supplemental agreement.

4.9 SUPPORTING COMMENTS

Performance Measure
HSHD - Calls answered within 40 seconds

HSHD - Calls abandoned through ring off

HSHD - Engaged calls

Comments
Performance Summary
Performance against the SLA for calls answered within 40
seconds and for abandoned calls, was 91.7% in February.

90.8% was achieved for performance against engaged calls,
which is a decrease from the previous month.

Cause
On 23/02/00, there was a particularly high level of engaged
and abandoned calls. This was due to a BT problem where
half of the lines coming into the HSH were not available.

Action
BT has since repaired the fault and there has been no re-
occurrence,

4a

HSHD - Level 1 calls resolved within 5 minutes

Performance Summary
91.9% of Level 1 calls were resolved within 5 minutes, This

shows an improvement when compared to January's
performance.

Cause

Some calls are taking longer to answer; this may be
attributable to new, inexperienced users, failing to articulate
the problem in a timely fashion.

Action

1. Ongoing improvements to training call logging processes,
within the HSH.

2. Investigation into the type of calls received which appear

to take longer than necessary to resolve.
Performance Summary
55.0% of priority A Hardware / Network calls were resolved
within 4 hours, and 90.0% were resolved within 6 hours.

70.3% of priority B calls were resolved within 8 hours and
78.7% of calls were resolved within 10 hours.

Failure of these SLAs can be attributed to by the following:

1. Calls having an initial prognosis of Hardware product
performance arising out of assumed Software implications
were transferred to the SMC where they followed Software
diagnosis processes. These processes involve a higher level of
diagnostics evaluation than that necessary for Hardware.
These calls, when eventually identified as being non-
Software, were referred back for Hardware resolution by site
visit. Due to the time elapse in software diagnosis there is a
risk of service delivery not being within the Call to Resolution
Time.

2. The comments in 1 above have been further compounded
that, from the start of the month, the resource dispatcher
allocating an engineer to site visit has done so based upon an
a.m./p.m. arrival of the call on to his call stack. This action
has initiated, on some occasions, the inherent delay in site
visiting by the engineer.

ACTION:

The above issues have been discussed with ICL Pathway's
Supplier and the following are to be implemented to return
to the higher level of service previously enjoyed by POCL:

1, All calls having a declared Hardware product performance

criteria identified within the call diagnosis text, which may or
may not be Software derived, to have filtration diagnose
conducted accordingly. This should minimise (de-risk) delay
occurring via extended Software diagnosis filtration where it
subsequently found to be a Hardware based call resolution.

2. Re-direct the resource dispatcher back to pre-February
process where allocation of site visiting calls for engineers re-
align to call age as well as the resolution time demanded by
the service profile.

Data Services - RDMC Reference Data Delivery by
Day D

Performance Summary
99.87% of RDMC Reference Data was delivered by Day D.

Cause
The failure of this SLA is attributed to the non-polling of
Outlets. There were no data file delivery delays in February.

Action

1. MSU have now successfully completed testing of the
revised non-polled Outlet reporting where those Outlets
responsible for Counter switch offs are identified with an
acceptable degree of accuracy. MSU will be passing
details of offending Outlets to POCL BSM for March 2000
onwards on a daily basis commencing 13/03/00.

2. ICL Pathway will continue to take action to drive down
non-polling caused by system or network faults.

Data Services - APS Reference Data Delivery by
Day D

Performance Summary
99.66% of APS Reference Data was delivered by Day D.

Cause
The failure of this SLA is attributed to the non-polling of
Outlets. There were no data file delivery delays in February.

Training Services - Training Course Timeliness
Live Delivery

Performance Summary
99.5% of training courses were delivered in the required time

(ie. within five days of the Horizon system being in Live
operation in the Outlet),

Cause

Knowledge Pool are in the process of adjusting to the 16 week
cycle which is now in use. As a result, some staff had been
accidentally scheduled for training prior to the 5 day window.
This was compounded by POCL requesting that staff be
trained outside of this window.

Action
This situation will be resolved by next month

Business Incident Management

Performance Summary

94.1% of business incidents were cleared within 5 working
days of receipt. (The definitions of ‘cleared’ being that
sufficient detail was supplied to POCL to allow reconciliation
or client settlement to take place).

Cause

There have been delays in obtaining data to enable BIMS.
reports to be issued in a timely manner. This is due to the
‘learning curve’ within ICL Pathway following the
introduction of the new business incident management
procedures. It should be noted however, that on some
occasions, authority to clear outstanding incidents was not
received from POCL even though ICL Pathway supplied the
information within the required time scale. Where this has
occurred, ICL Pathway has assumed that these incidents have
been cleared and as such, have been recorded in
conformance with the SLA.

Action

1. All MSU staff are now fully experienced in business
incident management procedure.

2. New BIMS database has been introduced with effect from
01/03/00, which identifies incidents that are approaching
the SLA deadline for clearance provoking priority action
within MSU.

3. MSU have advised POCL of the need to follow the agreed
procedures and advise clearance within a timely manner
to ensure incidents are resolved within the SLA.
