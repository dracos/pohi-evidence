I have a 1:1 with Paula tomorrow afternoon and proposed to raise the Sparrow issues with her then.

On Lyca, we will get a note to Mark shortly to share with Shex - I will provide a copy for Paul so that she is sighted on
this. Again, I will brief Paula on the issues tomorrow.

Further to Mark's message below, Paula has a call with BNR at 9.30 on Friday. She will need a short speaking note.
Patrick - are you happy to provide?

Mark - Do you think we need to cover the Lyca issue too?

I'm happy to talk through a potential approach - indeed it may be beneficial to consider our pitch collectively? Let me
know. For what it is worth, I support Jane's view that allowing Tim Parker the space to consider what impact these
meetings might have on his work is important.

In haste as travelling.
Richard C called.

BNR wants to see SAH and Second Sight. Richard agreed with her that this would not happen ahead of a Paula call with
her. So we need to get that in diary and brief Paula.

Separately ShEx met NFSP who raised with them - and worried them - prosecutions approach. NFSP view is SPMRs are
now widely blaming losses on Horizon "knowing" there will likely be no prosecutions. They also cited a case where a
member of staff was accused of theft, blamed Horizon and we are now pursuing the SPMR for the money despite clear
evidence of staff being to blame. Obviously I don't know any more details.

Where are we on the prosecutions piece?
