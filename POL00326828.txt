Subject: Information requested

Mike,

Further to your query.

The position is that POL acts as a private prosecutor in relation to the specific criminal case - adhering to the Code for
Crown Prosecutors and all statutory or other rules in relation to prosecuting offenders. It should be noted that
legislation gives the Director of Public Prosecutions to right to take over and close down a case if they regard that as
appropriate.

I hope that this assists.

Thanks

Mike
