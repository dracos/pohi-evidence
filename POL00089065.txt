Mr Grant lan ALLEN is the sub postmaster of the above branch and appeared at Chester
Crown on Friday 24" January 2013 for a PCMH hearing.

Mr John GIBSON represented the prosecution and HHJ David HALE presided over the matter.

Mr ALLEN had previously indicated that he would be willing to plead guilty on the basis that he
cannot account for the loss but admits covering it up. The agents requested if we are willing to
accept the plea on this basis. The agents were directed to seek advice from Post Office Legal
Services.

Mr John GIBSON prosecuting counsel was not entirely happy with the plea put forward and
contacted Post Office Legal Services and spoke with Jarnail SINGH who advised that the plea
was acceptable.

HHJ David HALE advised that as Grant lan ALLEN had not been charged with Theft he was
content to sentence on the basis of the plea put forward. HHJ Hale stood down the matter for
a report from the probation service.

HHJ David Hale on hearing the facts of the case and the mitigation advanced on behalf of the
defendant and on reading the probation report Mr ALLEN was sentenced to a 12 month
Community Order with 200 hours of unpaid work.

No costs or compensation was ordered as the defendant was due to declare himself bankrupt.

There is a loss of £11,705 to Post Office Ltd and the civil route should be considered to recover
the amount outstanding.
