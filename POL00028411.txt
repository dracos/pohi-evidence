*TreasuryReview identified 4 areas which could ‘unlock’ time

Two were agreed by all parties on 28/10/98

These brought forward the NRO date by 3 weeks

*Current plan adds 6 weeks testing, less the 3 weeks, less 1 week
saved by migrating after Easter

day counter cycle, 6 day E2E cycle
* Version 1 of plan delayed MOT to 22/2:

target test results, and weekend working

+ E2E setup week moved to 8/2

POL00028411
POL00028411

Coverage by end of Cycle 2

* All systems and interfaces except CAPS
* All high priority incidents to be witnessed

* Critical business functions to be executed
satisfactorily against measured targets

¢ A large number of ‘cleared’ lower priority
incidents will need to be witnessed in MOT.

* But Pathway system and. regression tests
will also be complete

Next Steps —

* Review Cycle 1 with CAPS on 18/1

* Plan to start Cycle 2 on 19/1, to complete
on 27/1 (follow-up fault clearance to 5/2)

* Complete and agree MOT entry criteria by
22/1 :

* Gain confirmation from TIP and HAPS on
readiness to procede to MOT

* MOT entry meeting with CAPS on 3/2

POL00028411
POL00028411

Context for Multi-Benefit

* No final ministerial decision

A POCL/Pathway/Fujitsu commercial
arrangement
No final DSS/Pathway arrangement
Different planning emphases

— ‘earliest realistic date for office rollout?(POCL)

— ‘stable plans for deployment of critical multi-
benefit systems’ (BA/DSS)

— ‘maintain Treasury review plan’ (Pathway)

POL00028411
POL00028411

/ Option .1 - CAPS Concerns

* Increased parallelism of testing
— overlap of single and multi-benefit model office

— multi-benefit MO starts before NR2 fully live at
data centre migration

* Increased parallelism of live trials
— planned gap of only 2 weeks’ between trials
* Millennium effect - a months delay in NRO
could postpone MB trial into 2000

* Risks an unstable start to MB live trial

Option 1 - POCL View

¢ Some Horizon multi-benefit testing already
performed in E2E without serious problems

* Scale of POCL testing of multi-benefit
limited in comparison to POCL/ChB

+ No necessary link of multi-benefit model
office to data centre migration date

¢ But limited contingency for multi-benefit
trial (although some overlap possible ?)

« And Pathway delivery doubts remain

Programme Plans Option 2 for CAPS Board - Defer Multi-Benefit Trial to April 2000

Option 2 - Delay to April 2000

* Multi-benefit trial delayed by 7 months

* National card rollout (and CAPS 4.0)

t

* Need to split POCL and BA components of
NR2+ for testing and rollout to avoid
unnecessary delay to POCL

Option 2 - POCL View

parties (minimum payment guarantees etc)
Risk of litigation

go-ahead by Ministers

I Option 3 - JSA Trial only in 1999

* Some benefits in planning terms over
Option 2 (phasing, earlier rollout etc)

* Less risk to BA plans in 99

* But raises same commercial and business
issues as Option 2

* No easier to pursue and agree at this point

Summary - POCL View
* Options 2/3 not currently negotiable with
Pathway
— Treasury Review is agreed commercial basis
— Firm action taken on testing slippage
— Target date for NRO on new plan is still: August
— Up to 1 month contingency after August
~ Serious commercial impact of any card delay
* Recent progress on revised testing plan does
not easily justify change at this time

POL00028411
POL00028411

Preferred Way Forward
* Delay decision on multi-benefit plan until
mid-March :
* Prepare fallback position given risk in plan

* Monitor testing weekly and pre-RAB status
fortnightly :

¢ Allow time for ministerial discussions to
complete

i
I
I
I
I * Progress service management issues and
I

multi-benefit pre-proving for end February

Key Questions

¢ Can we prove now that the Single Benefit
plan is unachievable ?

¢ Is the cost of maintaining the multi-benefit -
plan acceptable for the time being ?

¢ Is it necessary to defer a decision until
- March when ‘politics’ and MOT status will
'.~ be clearer ?
* Can we agree what conditions would
Force’ acceptance of Option 2 ?
