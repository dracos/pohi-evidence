Introduction

Within SVM/SDM/PRO/0025 the POA Problem Management Procedure there is a requirement in section
4.3 to undertake trend analysis, within section 4.4.2 to review the Knowledge database and within section
4.5 to review the problems which were raised, their ownership and continue monitoring for service
improvement opportunities.

1 Analysis

This document contains the analysis of the 34 problem records raised in the POA Problem Management
TfS database during 2015.

1.1 Categorisation

The analysis has been conducted in two phases. The first phase has been conducted by a POA Problem
Manager and has resulted in categorising the problems into three types.

Type 1 — Further analysis is required within Post Office Account seeking input from POA design,
development, testing and release. Sixteen problem records were classified under this category.

Type 2 — These were Administration Closures, e.g., the problem record was raised in error against the
incorrect resolver group. Four problem records were classified under this Category.

Type 3 -The underlying issue was found to have originated in a third party domain, e.g., Post Office
Limited or one of their clients or suppliers. Fourteen problem records were classified under this
category.

1.2 POA Review of Problems in the Fujitsu Domain or

Further Consideration Required.

On Wednesday 20" January 2016 at 09:30 a review was held of the problem records from 2015
which were categorised as type 1 by the following group;

Mark Ascott Live System Test

Andrew Gibson UNIX

Andy Hemingway Infrastructure

Tony Wicks Problem Management

Rajaram Kuppuramaseshan SMC

Nirupama Sane POLSAP Support

Gaby Reynolds Online Services

Nick Crow Branch and Comms Management
Jolene Ngu Problem Management

Subsequent to the review applicable Problem Records for 2015 were discussed with Roger
Stearn POA Networks SDM and Torstein Godeseth POA Chief Architect.

Findings and Recommendations.

A monthly check has been put in place to assist in preventing this from reoccurring in the future. The
SMC has been monitoring for 2 months and no issue has been identified.

Action:

As a monthly checklist has been put in place, no further action is recommended.

Findings and Recommendations.

At the review, it was agreed that coding checks could possibly be undertaken by Development.

Action:

Tony Wicks to write to Development requesting them to consider if it's possible to do some coding
checks for this and similar situations as per the failure. This request has been made for Development's

consideration.

again, a duplicate will occur.

A code fix has been developed
and is in release 12.88 Hot fix

Findings and Recommendations.

It is suggested that a ‘regression’ test for this type of failure could be run on new releases before being
released into the Live environment. A regression test has been added to the LST test suite to validate for

this scenario in future releases.

Action:

As a regression test has been put in place since R12.88, no further action is recommended.

A10530531 I Network instability

branch service
during the week
commencing
Monday 12th
October.

Specific targeted network
traffic from a third party
caused instability in the Fujitsu
shared network. This irregular
targeted traffic was caused by
a configuration issue on a third
party router.

Consideration should be
given for Fujitsu
Networks & Telecoms
when implementing a
new solution to protect
the Fujitsu connect DSL
network from abnormal
traffic.

Yes

Findings and Recommendations.

Fujitsu Networks & Telecoms advised a script was introduced during the Major Incident to protect the

Fujitsu shared DSL network from a reoccurrence in the future.

Action:

No further POA / Fujitsu action is recommended.

A10122010 I VPX servers

crashing.

There are several underlying
causes for the VPX crashes.
Development have ascertain
that it may be caused by
memory leakage, NetCoo!l
probes or Server software
upgrades including security
patches.

The POA Problem and
Incident Team will be
monitoring this until mid-
February 2016 and
Development will be following
up on the NetCool concerns
with MSS via PEAK.

Consideration could be
given for hardware and
software upgrade based
on the server lifespan.

Yes

Findings and Recommendations.

NetCool Probe restarts are performed every day and will be monitored for the next 3 months. VPN has
been added into Post Office Detail Branch Report. Additional measures have also been taken to monitor

the VPX servers and entries are made into the report when there is a failure.

Action:

Investigations into this open Problem Record are on-going.

A9391723 I Concerns have
been raised within
POA that there are
possible SPoF
within the HNG-X
infrastructure and
that a platform
recovery strategy
needs defining.

The POA Chief Architect was
leading on the platform
recovery strategy. Additionally,
an exercise was started for
Problem Management to liaise
with the Disaster Recovery
(System Owner) on the
documentation that already
exists on Single Points of
Failure. SPOFs related to the
Bladeframe will be going as
part of Horizon Refresh.

There should always be
a clear recovery
strategy and capability
defined for all platforms
and a nominated owner
for all platforms.

No

Findings and Recommendations.

As part of the HNG-X Data Centre Refresh it is intended that Physical Platform Design specifications are

being updated to include the platform recovery strategy within the document.

Additionally, a tactical solution is being implemented, under CP1725, for the cloning of platforms.

Action:

No further POA action to that above is recommended.

A9331408 I POA are non-
compliant with the
ITG code of
connection
regarding Windows
2003 servers

POA are non-compliant with
the ITG code of connection
regarding Windows 2003
servers. There are three POA
servers (LSBPPRGO01,
CITPXCS002, CITPNALO02)
which ITG intend to quarantine
on Friday 17th July 2015 and it
is possible that there could be
more servers.

Tracking the project weekly
ensured that all servers were
migrated or retired with the
exception of the Integration
managed Dimension Servers.

Consideration should be
given to always ensure
that the operating
system used is still in
support and whenever
necessary, for an
update to be done
before expiry date. If the
operating system
support is going to be
withdrawn, an action
needs to be taken
before 1 year of the
date.

Yes

Findings and Recommendations.

It was concluded that all servers should have proper design documentation, e.g., PPD’s, regardless of

whether in live or ITG.

Actions:

Tony Wicks to write to John Bradley highlighting the issue and requesting that consideration is given to
documenting within the PPD’s when the server and software support expires and constructing a database
which contains component details & expiry dates and provides adequate advanced warning that support
is going to expire.

Findings and Recommendations

Findings and Recommendations.

It was concluded that this was due to unannounced changes in the third party domain. As this is outside
of POA and Fujitsu control and POA Problem Management have already raised a cross domain Problem
Record A9129261, “Unannounced and uncoordinated infrastructure changes are being implemented in
third party domains which have caused serious service outages”, for which ATOS Problem Management
advised that ATOS are managing this under Continual Service Improvement 3893, no further action was
identified.

Findings and Recommendations.

As a permanent corrective action has been put in place with 2 new columns added for housekeeping
routines and a reporting capability for payment files has been added to HORice it was concluded that no
further action is required.

Action:
No further action is required as the corrective action mentioned above has been completed.

Findings and Recommendations.

There is no action that Fujitsu can take. POL and Atos should advise Fujitsu of any proposed changes in
another domain. A Change Request should have been submitted by POL / ATOS. The related Problem
Record is A9129261 and ATOS advised that they have raised a CSI 3893 to address the issue of

Findings and Recommendations.

The Live System Test team reviewed and considered including this in the regression suite. However, this
additional testing would require a considerable amount of manual input and resources. As this would
extend the time period required for conducting the tests it was concluded that this additional regression
testing could not be justified.

Action:
At this time no further POA action is recommended.
