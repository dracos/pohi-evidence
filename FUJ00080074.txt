Branch Availability SLT Matrix added to the document. Branch
Availability Matrix has been updated to reflect updated as
follows

- Remove references to SLT periods per year and calculations
of figures on an average SLT period basis. SLT %s are
calculated on a per annum basis, with these percentages
applied to each month — as agreed with Adam Martin

- Base the SLTs on the MTBFs and number of
counters/branches as at April 2007. This gives constant SLT
%s which will only be updated when the MTBFs and number of
counters/branches in this calculation are updated.

SLTs have been removed from the document and the reader
referred to the branch availability matrix to view the SLTs.
This is due to the fact that during the network closure
programme, the SLTs will be changed on a quarterly basis.

2.3.2.2. In such events, Fujitsu Services will use its reasonable endeavours to resolve the Incident as
quickly as possible and while Branch and Counter unavailability will be reported to Post Office,
such proportion will not count towards the SLT conformance measurement and the proportion of
unavailability applicable to such Counter Positions will not count towards the liquidated damages
calculation for the Counter Availability SLT.

2.3.4 Rectification Plan
See paragraph 7.1 of Schedule C1 of the Agreement.

2.3.5 Service Levels for which Liquidated Damages Apply
2.3.5.1 Branch and Counter Availability

2.3.5.1.1 Branch Availability

The availability of a Branch is measured across the network of Branches where those Branches are able
to perform all Transactions and communicate with the HNG-X Central Infrastructure. A Branch will be
deemed unavailable if it is not able to perform all Transactions (except during an agreed fallback
condition as defined in section 2.3.4.25 (Table 3)) or communicate with the HNG-X Central
Infrastructure. The Branch Availability metric is defined as the number of Branch hours available as a
proportion of the maximum number of Branch hours available based upon the Post Office Core Day and
the Post Office Critical Period. The Branch Availability metric will be reported daily, one day in arrears.

2.3.5.1.2 Counter Availability

The availability of a Counter Position is measured across the network of Counter Positions where those
Counter Positions are able to perform all Transactions. A Counter Position will be deemed to be
unavailable (except during an agreed fallback condition as defined in section 2.3.4.2.5 (Table 3)) if it is
not able to perform all Transactions, or communicate with the HNG-X Central Infrastructure. The Counter
Availability metric is defined as the number of Counter Position hours available as a proportion of the
maximum number of Counter Position hours available based upon the Post Office Core Day and the Post
Office Critical Period. The Counter Availability metric will be reported daily, one day in arrears. Any
liquidated damages payable by Fujitsu Services in connection with the Counter Availability SLT shall
apply to periods after (and including) the first day of the first month following signature of CCN1200.

2.3.5.1.3 Method

(a) The Branch Network Service will extract data from the Service Desk Incident Management
System to show all Hardware, Software and Branch Telecom Infrastructure faults logged via the
Service Desk on the previous Working Day, by the Branch or Fujitsu Services, irrespective of
whether or not they are open or closed at the time of extraction.

The Branch Network Service will match this data against the Fujitsu Services view of the status
of each Branch and Counter Position. This will establish if the Branch or Counter Position
experienced an outage during the Post Office Core Day and Post Office Critical Period. Where
an Incident remains open for more than one (1) day, the total Downtime will be used to calculate
the Branch and Counter Availability SLTs.

(c) The total number of hours of Downtime is then calculated.

(b

(d) Downtime will impact:

. Branch Availability - only where it is deemed that the whole Branch is unavailable. i.e. an
outage of four (4) hours would show four (4) hours of Branch unavailability; and

° Counter Availability - only where it is deemed that all the Counter Positions in the Branch
are unavailable, i.e. a ten (10) Counter Position Branch with an outage of 4 hours would
show 10 x 4 hours equalling 40 hours Counter unavailability.

2.3.5.1.4 Reporting

(a) For both Branch Availability and Counter Availability, Fujitsu Services will report daily against
both the Post Office Core Day and against the Post Office Critical Period. Both Post Office and
Fujitsu Services will periodically review the allocation of the Post Office Critical Period and jointly
agree to adjust this period, if necessary, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

(0.

Fujitsu Services will provide daily management information in respect of all Branches and
Counter Positions that are unavailable for whatever reason, even if caused by factors outside of
Fujitsu Services control, e.g. power outages and agreed SLT exclusions, to assist Post Office in
managing Branch expectations and to direct the appropriate service management practices
within Fujitsu Services.

s

Fujitsu Services and Post Office will monitor the effect of MTBF changes across the Branch
Hardware and will periodically review the Branch and Counter Availability SLTs and, if necessary,
jointly agree new targets, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

2.3.5.1.5 Qualifications

(a) The availability of a Branch or Counter Position is defined by the ability to complete all
Transactions including those related to the operation of the system, (e.g. logging on to the
system). Where an adequate method of fallback can occur, (e.g. where a bar code reader fails
and information can be input via the screen or keyboard), such failures are excluded from the
calculations and do not count against availability. Additionally, where a fault occurs on a
peripheral which disables the Counter Position in a single counter Branch, (e.g. the monitor), this
will count against Branch Availability in this type of Branch but will only count against Counter
Availability in a multi-counter Branch.

(b) The calculation is based upon Post Office staff being able to use 100% of the Counter Positions
100% of the time.

(1) The following definitions shall apply for the purpose of calculating the liquidated damages payable in
respect of the Counter Availability SLT:

(a) Failure Event means an event or series of connected events which causes one or more Counter
Positions to be deemed to be Unavailable due to a Network Wide Failure or a Local Failure.
Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part of such Failure Event until the Failure Event is closed
in accordance with the Incident closure process which is set out in the Working Document
entitled “Major Incident Process” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) (Incident Closure Process).

(b) Liquidated Damages Amount means the amount specified in the column entitled “Liquidated
Damages payable per hour or part thereof in excess of Network and Local Allowance per
Counter position per calendar month” in Table 5 of section 2.3.4.2.7.

io

Counter Unavailability means, in respect of a Failure Event, either:

i. in respect of a Local Failure, the total obtained by adding together all Individual Counter
Unavailability Periods for all Counter Positions affected by the Failure Event; or

ii. In respect of a Network Wide Failure, the Network Counter Unavailability Period
multiplied by the number of Counter Positions rendered Unavailable by the Failure Event.

(d) Individual Counter Position Unavailability Period means the time for which an individual
Counter Position is Unavailable (rounded in accordance with the Table 4a as set out below).

(e) Network Counter Position Unavailability Period means the time the affected Counter
Positions are Unavailable (rounded in accordance with the Table 4b as set out below).

(f) Monthly Allowance means the 'Network and Local Allowance per Counter Position per calendar
month’ shown in column 4 of Table 5 (as amended from time to time pursuant to section 2.3.4.2.7
(j)) multiplied by the average number of Counter Positions in use during the relevant month. For
the avoidance of doubt, at the end of each calendar month, any unused Monthly Allowance shall
expire and shall not be rolled over into the next month.

es

Unavailable means, in respect of a Counter Position, that it is not able to perform all
Transactions, or communicate with the HNG-X Central Infrastructure (and that an agreed fallback
condition as defined in section 2.3.4.2.5 (Table 3) does not apply) during a Post Office Core Day.

(2) Subject to sections 2.3.4.2.7 (3) and (4) below, the liquidated damages for failure to meet the
Counter Availability SLT in a month shall be calculated by:

(a) adding together the Counter Unavailability in respect of each Failure Event that occurred in the
month (the date of occurrence being deemed for this purpose to be the date on which the Failure
Event is closed in accordance with the Incident Closure Process);

(b) Deducting the Monthly Allowance from the total in (a); and
(c) Multiplying the remainder by the Liquidated Damages Amount.

(3) For a Failure Event:

(a) The Incident Closure Process will require Post Office and Fujitsu Services to agree the number of
Branches and Counter Positions affected and the duration of the outage;

(b) if the value of the liquidated damages for a Failure Event which gives rise to a Network Wide
Failure would be in excess of £400,000 then:

(i) Fujitsu Services shall have the right to not count its Monthly Allowance towards the Counter
Unavailability in respect of such Failure Event if it so notifies Post Office in writing. In such
cases, the Monthly Allowance shall not be deducted from the Counter Unavailability in
respect of that Failure Event; and

(ii) Only £400,000 shall be counted towards the liquidated damages payable for that month in
respect of that Failure Event.

(4) For the avoidance of doubt, Unavailability is only counted once, so that for so long as a Counter
Position is rendered Unavailable by a Failure Event it shall not be counted in calculating the
number of Counter Positions affected by a second Failure Event.

(5) Liquidated damages will be reported, measured and agreed monthly and paid quarterly in

arrears.
(6) The Local Allowance element of the Monthly Allowance will be varied as follows:

i. increased by 5% per annum (as set out in Table 5); or

ii. if the assumptions in paragraphs 3.3.1 (b) or (c) of Schedule B3.4 proves incorrect,
increased by a percentage equal to the difference between the actual MTBF and the

iii. if there is a substantive change to the Branch Infrastructure (for example replacement of
a number of counter printers), such that the actual MTBF is expected to decrease, the
parties will negotiate in good faith to reduce the Local Allowance to reflect that decrease.
