‘Subjec Remote Access Papers: for review

Hi James,

Hope you enjoyed the break. Attached are a couple of papers with regards to the ‘Remote access’ issue

1) A paper that going forward we can refer to in response to claims in, for example, draft CRRs of transactions

mysteriously appearing in SPMRs accounts.

2) Amuch shorter bulleted high level list of what can / cannot be done with regards to remote access. To be

used in, for example public rebuttals.

There are a series of questions within each, that once answered, I believe will put this issue to bed once and for all. If
you / the appropriate person at FJ could take a look and provide answers to the questions posed and track change any

inaccuracies — that would be fantastic.

Please note, these draft documents, and any communications or other documents associated with it, are confidential,
privileged and prepared in contemplation of litigation. They must be kept confidential and not disclosed to any other

person.

Any questions, please do let me know.
Thanks

Mark
