Risk update

8. CEO report

The CEO highlighted three themes from his report. Firstly, the need to focus on delivery and
execution, and to exercise a high degree of caution around taking on any more assignments.
Secondly, the revised values which had been circulated to Board members, which have been
generated with input from a range of colleagues, and represent an achievable standard to which
all staff can aspire. The Board agreed that the focus on culture was necessary and positive, and
noted the current thinking on this within CIRG. Thirdly, the diversity and inclusion agenda was
discussed including the Seriously Inclusive sessions, and the ongoing independent audit.

With the departure of Maddy McTernan and Candida Morley, there is a need to increase the pool
of director-level staff. One internal promotion is in progress, subject to ministerial approval. A
process to recruit a further one or two directors will be launched in the next month or so. Having
carefully considered the internal structure, it has been concluded that here is no current need to
revise reporting lines.

Action: Seriously Inclusive consultants to be invited along to a Board meeting to provide
feedback.

9. People report

Based on conversations directly with individuals, or with line managers, it is clear that both staff
well-being and productivity is deteriorating, driven by increased levels of sickness absence, home-
schooling pressures and increased workloads. A well being survey will be conducted in the week
commencing 25 January.

An update was provided on the office renovation which commences in February. Staff have been
fully engaged in the re-design, via surveys and Q&A sessions. The designs will both increase
desk capacity to accommodate an increased workforce, and increase meeting and break-out
capacity, which, with improved audio-visual technology, will facilitate hybrid office and
homeworking patterns. This will be necessary as, even with the increased capacity, the office will
not be able to accommodate all staff. The Board enquired as to how this will be managed. Given
the complex, matrix structure in UKGI, it is not possible to dictate a working pattern, so this will
need to develop organically, with the risk that from time to time there may not be adequate space
for everyone that wants to use the office on a particular day.

The COO also noted that discussions are ongoing with the RemCo chair to consider how to
perform appraisals in such an unusual year. Board members were asked to contact the COO if
they had insights as to how other firms were dealing with this challenge, and examples of COVID-
overlay metrics being adopted.

10. Staff forums feedback

Clare Hollingsworth, the designated employee-engagement NED, gave some feedback on her
meetings with staff in each of the grade forums. Challenges noted included a sense of always
being on call, tiredness, and concerns around pay and progression fairness and opportunities.
Positive feedback was provided on the on-boarding process, the drive to be less bureaucratic,
and a general enthusiasm to get back into the office. The next forum will be with the BAME
network.

11. CFO report

The report was noted; the HMT sponsorship team has allocated additional resource to work on
the financial model for UKGI, to make is more responsive to demand, so that plans can be agreed
in good time for the SR. The Board approved the change to the bonus budget.
