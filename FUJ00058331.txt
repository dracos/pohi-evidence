Introduction

This document describes the activities that occur in Outlets from the
installation of the Horizon Counter platform through to the support of the
Outlet and equipment in the Steady State environment.

Two groups of activities are encountered;

« Upgrade - where the Horizon counter system has already been installed in
an Outlet and is enhanced to the next release.

e Installation - where the Horizon counter equipment is being installed for the
first time in an Outlet.

At release 1c the following are encountered.

Environment Process Description
IGL Upgrade 10 Initial Go Live
Outlets
Release 1b Upgrade Approx. 190 outlets
installed at release 1b.

This document deals with the following;

e Preparation of auto configuration files for outlets and Data Centres in
readiness for the installation of the Horizon platform.

« Pre installation activities that occur in the Outlet before installation of the
Horizon counter equipment.

e De-installation and installation activities for the Horizon counter equipment
e Peripheral tests performed after Horizon counter equipment installation

e Outlet Manager acceptance tests performed after Horizon equipment
installation

« Overview of the In office data migration activities
« Hand over of the Horizon counter environment for Steady State support

The completion of these processes means that the post office is established
and the equipment is in operational service.

The document at this release now includes information relating to the Horizon
Field Support Officers as described in Ref. 4.

Scope

The document provides the following;

* configure the Horizon counter equipment and Data Centres ready for
installation,

e ensure that the equipment is installed in the new Outlets,

e ensure that the equipment is upgraded in existing Outlets,

e ensure that the equipment is operating correctly on installation,

« demonstrate to the Outlet Manager that the equipment is operating,
« handover to steady state

From the acceptance of this document further lower level working instructions
are produced.

For the Horizon Field Support Officers these will be the HFSO procedures;
For the Exel installers these will be their work instructions

For the Auto configuration operations this will be the Operational aspects of
Auto configuration.

3 Release 1c

This release provides additional facilities to that of release 1b. The release,
however still only provides a reduction in the target functionality for release 1.
The counter equipment is upgraded in that a new keyboard is introduced to
facilitate the use of 4k Smart card technologies and the counter printer is
replaced to support an upgraded firmware release’. The upgraded software is
introduced by swapping out the existing base units. The reduced set of
functionality means that the system is used along side the post office current
operating procedures.

For IGL offices the release requires that new hardware is installed and that
the existing card population is supported at the new release.

The Horizon equipment is delivered to the target outlets using the full
implementation infrastructure described in Ref. [1].

1 The final decision as to whether the counter printer will be swapped out during the upgrade will be made after
publication of this document. If counter printers are to be swapped the procedures in this document are to be followed. If
the counter printers are not swapped, the existing counter printer in the office will remain and the procedures in this
document relating to the swap out of the counter printer are to be ignored,

POST OFFICE
ESTABLISHMENT
PROCESS

The Post Office Establishment process describes the activities that take place
between the Outlet Implementation Preparation Activities and hand over to
the Steady State team as an operational service. Included in this document
are the activities associated with auto configuration.

For this release successful completion of the processes described in this
document means that the system has been accepted by the post master.
Support for the system will then move from the Implementation team to the
Customer Service team.

Role of the Horizon Field Support Officers

The Horizon Field Support Officers support the outlet manager and staff
during the post office establishment procedures. The work instructions
specific to the Horizon Field Support Officer are described in a lower level
series of documents raised as a result of this document.

The number of Horizon Field Support Officers required to support the
introduction of release 1c is determined between Pathway and POCL using
the existing processes established at release 1b. ( Ref. [4]).

Auto configuration

This section provides an overview of the processes involved in generating
and applying a configuration to the Horizon counter environment.
Configuration parameters are required to allow the end to end communication
between the different components of the Horizon infrastructure.

From the acceptance of this document further lower level working instructions
are produced.

Autoconfiguration database

To ensure that all the relevant configuration information is consistent across
the Horizon infrastructure, the relevant parameters for each of the systems is
modelled on the Autoconfiguration database. Outlet details are generated
using information supplied from the rollout database, configuration rules
(such the IP addressing scheme) and standard parameter configuration
information.

Reports generated from the Autoconfiguration database are passed to a
number of sources, external to Pathway and are applied to the relevant
systems. For release 1c this will be performed on a working day basis
between 30 and 25 working days from installation of target Outlets. This
information is obtained from the rollout database (Ref. [1]).

The following table shows the activities involved in generating configurations
for the Horizon counter equipment and the corresponding Data Centre and
support systems (Ref. [1]).

Activity Description

Access auto configuration data base. I Access is provided from specific
workstations on the rollout help desk.

Select Bulk input Bulk input provides details of target
outlets or individual outlets which
may be selected through the MMI.

Outlets are ordered relating to the
installation date from the rollout
database.

Responsibility
The responsibility for generation of the auto configuration files is the Horizon

central implementation team help desk. Outlets and the associated systems
are configured based on the target implementation date.

Action on success
Inform CFM, ICL Sorbus and CM of completion of days activities.

Action on failure

Report failure together with appropriate error messages through to the
Horizon implementation central team for further action.

Configuration of the Horizon Counter System

The Horizon system when delivered and installed in an Outlet has sufficient
configuration information to allow the Auto configuration software to initialise.
This level of software is the same on all systems whether it is a gateway or
counter system. It is during the Auto configuration boot process that the
difference is detected.

The Auto configuration boot process requires minimal interaction with the
Installer and the process is designed to functionally test the Base unit and its
associated peripherals during the sequence.

For the Auto configuration process to complete successfully, all the hardware
installation procedures for the system must be completed. This includes the
loading of paper to the printers etc..

The Autoconfiguration process for an Outlet is dependant on the order in
which systems are installed. This is described in section 5.

An overview of process is described in section 4.2.1

Overview of the Auto configuration process

When the installer connects the gateway server to the ISDN connection,
powers on the system and scans the bar code during the installation process
( see section 5) sufficient information is configured on the base system to
enable a connection to a boot server system installed in the Pathway data

centre to be made. Should the bar code not be available in the outlet then the
outlet details can be entered manually to the system by selection of specific
keys*. Specific information relating to that particular post office gateway
server is downloaded to the system. At this point the server automatically
applies the configuration information and reloads.

After the system has reloaded, the gateway server then has sufficient
information to establish a connection to the Pathway management centre
from which the full configuration file (ACF) is downloaded. The server will
then apply this configuration information and reload again.

After the system has reloaded for the second time the server is fully
personalised with configuration information specific to that post office outlet
and counter configuration. The system is then ready for the secure phase of
the operation to start. This is the Outlet manager logon. On completion of the
Outlet manager logon process, the server will then communicate with the data
centre to download specific Riposte information. This process may take up to
15 minutes to complete.

Any additional counter servers in the outlet follow the same process except
that the first configuration information is obtained from the gateway server
and the loading of Riposte information is also obtained from the gateway
server.

Full details of the auto configuration process are found in Ref. 3.

IGL Outlets

The activities performed at IGL outlets apply to 10 specific outlets in the
South Wales and South West region. The upgrade activities at these outlets
occur over a specified migration weekend. The activities are scheduled to
start at the close of business on Friday evening and complete by Monday
morning.

The migration weekend activities require co-ordination with data centre
migration activities. To ensure that management of the post office
establishment procedures in the outlets is controlled a local management
centre will be established from which specific timing of the activities will be
controlled by ICL Pathway. This local management centre will be the primary
contact for the data centre migration team who are controlling the whole
weekend activities.

The activities described in this section will be carried out firstly on one of the
outlets followed by the rest of the 9 outlets. Activities in the outlet are
controlled through the local management centre.

Spare Key Policy

Each of the existing base units is chained to the outlet infrastructure. To
remove the unit requires that the unit is unlocked using a key held by the
outlet manager. Spare keys are held by ICL Pathway. For the migration
weekend spare keys will be held at the local management centre. Should no
key be available then bolt cutters will be used.

The IGL outlets have been checked by ICL pathway to ensure that site is
ready for installation.

Recovery procedures

The existing equipment will initially de installed and stored in a labelled
overshipper in the delivery vehicle. Should any part of the upgrade fail or
instructions be passed to regress then all of the new equipment will be
swapped out and replaced with the existing equipment (ref. [6]).

The existing equipment will be then transported after a successful
implementation to the local management centre for safe keeping. Should any
part of the upgrade fail or instructions be passed to regress to the existing
system, then all of the new equipment is swapped out and replaced with the
existing equipment. The existing equipment is transported back to the outlet
from the local management centre unpacked and installed using the IGL
counter infrastructure installation document (ref. [6]). No data migration back
to the old system is required at the outlet. This is achieved at the data
centre.(Ref. [2]).

After the migration weekend activities the existing equipment will be
transported back to a safe storage site. If regression is required at the outlet
after the upgrade weekend activities, then the existing equipment will be
transported back to the outlet from the safe storage site, unpacked and
installed using the IGL counter infrastructure installation document (ref. [6]).
No data migration back to the old system is required at the outlet. This is
achieved at the data centre.(Ref. [2]).

The activities performed at outlets which have currently been installed with
the Horizon counter system at release 1b are upgraded at this release. The
activities include a swap out of the base unit, keyboard and counter printer at
each position. The upgrade activities at these outlets will occur over a
specific working day period during the operation day. Some disruption to the
existing service may be experienced whilst the upgrade takes place.

The replaced items will be removed from the outlet using the packaging in
which the new equipment was delivered.

Should any books require scanning during the installation period, then the
outlet manager will use the existing manual facilities (Ref. [2]).

The following activities occur on the day of installation of the Horizon counter
equipment.

Peripheral Tests

This section provides the procedures which are used during installation for
functionally testing the peripherals. These tests assume that all the
peripherals have been correctly installed. The Touch screen monitor, Bar
code reader and keyboard (including the smart card facility) is tested during
the installation, auto configuration and security phase activities. The
functionality of the base unit is tested during the installation, configuration
and security phases, however additional information is also provided in this
section which is used by the Exel engineers.

The equipment that requires further testing is the counter printer and office
printer. These two items are covered in the following sections.

Counter printer

The counter printer is functionally tested using the self print test. This is
achieved by powering on the printer with the “Resume” key held. This test is
performed using the procedures established at release 1b. After the test has
been successfully performed the printer is powered off and on again.

Office Printer

Two types of printer exist. These tests only check the operation of the printer
as a unit. The integrated test for the printer will not be available at this
release. Testing of the unit for future releases in not covered in this
document.

Inkjet Printer

e Load paper in the unit.

e Power on the printer. The power switch is located on the top of the printer
to the right of the paper feed tray as viewed from the front.

If the power indicator light does not display then check power cables.

e Test Print - To initiate a test print power off the printer and press and hold
the LOAD/EJECT button while turning the printer back on. When the
printer starts printing, let go of the LOAD/EJECT button. This should output
a printed sheet with a title “EPSON Stylus 200” followed by some technical
information.
