FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL (FUJITSU EYES ONLY)

2 Introduction

This section of the report covers the Fujitsu EBMS which defines how we work. The key components of
the BMS can be found on Café VIK at EBMS Processes.

Updates to the EBMS are received from Group Quality each month. These updates are being cascaded
to the Leadership Team via the Monthly Quality Report. The Quality and Compliance Team is ensuring
that future updates have been cascaded to Process Owners/Leads.

A full history of EBMS Updates can be found at EBMS Change History.

The Account is required to produce for this, a lessons learned quality review and a quality management
highlights and lowlights reports.

3 Waivers & Lets

The EBMS Waiver List shows the current Waivers and Lets from Fujitsu’s BMS process and are subject
to review by the Account Process owner three months prior to the expiry of the Waiver or Let. Due to
recent changes in the BMS, the Account may need to consider waivers against these because of the
timescales required to deliver them.

4 Assessments

The Account is subject to assessments (audits) from various sources:
1. External to Fujitsu

e Fujitsu's certification body (currently BV) who conduct assessments where initial
registration to standards is being sought, surveillance assessments for standards to
which Fujitsu is already registered. This currently includes the standards listed here.

e POL who may conduct audits as they are allowed to do under the terms of The
Agreement with Fujitsu.

2. External to the Account

e Assessement Services and Security Governance conduct assessments as part of
Fujitsu’s agreement with Fujitsu’s certification body (currently BV) to reduce the amount
of assessment carried out directly by the certification body. Assessement Services and
Security Governance sometimes carries out additional assessments at the request of the
Account to help prepare for external assessments.

3. Internal to the Account
e POA Quality Management conduct local health checks on the Account to ensure that the

account is complying with local processes and procedures, with the EBMS and the
standards and that the Account is required to comply with under the terms of the

Agreement.

4.1 Assessments/Health Checks Planned
Health Checks are a quick, focused, short duration review of critical processes to confirm their capability

and identify improvement opportunities to the efficiency and effectiveness of the process in meeting
business goals.

The POA Compliance Framework has identified areas which, based on previous external and internal
non-conformities, observations and ISO 27001 Health Checks, require further investigation and these
have been included in the integrated assessment plan.

The following assessment and Health Check has taken place and has not yet been finalised:

5 Quality and Compliance Framework

POA has contractual, legislative and compliance requirements placed upon it by its stakeholders and
evidence that these are met is required as part of its assurance to the Stakeholders. This is achieved via
its internal and external compliance and accreditation audits and Health checks.

The controls required to meet its accreditation and compliance are documented in Fujitsu’s EBMS and
this document.

POA has undertaken a review of these controls to provide Post Office Limited (POL) with an ISAE 3402
Statement of Compliance Report in March 2016. This work was undertaken in conjunction with Ernst and
Young (E&Y) and (POL) and is repeated annually.

This ISAE 3402 SOCR coupled with the Account’s ISO 27001 and assisting POL’s own accreditation to
the PCI DSS standards have provided the framework and assurance needed to both Fujitsu and POL.
