HiJB

Thank you for your email, Iam happy to work with your suggestions and maybe it’s better to speak to
the new team members early Feb? Also I am happy to speak to them team in person when your team
are in Chesterfield, let me know the dates several weeks in advance please.

Lastly, did you have a think about our discussions regarding investigations team when we spoke at
Wood st? Happy to discuss this with you further in needed.

Hi Saf

Unfortunately my team is dispersed all over the country and is not based at Chesterfield. We do sometimes go to
Chesterfield for training days etc so I'll let you know when the next session will be. Alternatively, if you’re happy to
speak to the team on Teams, then we can organise that very easily. On the 24" Jan we have a new team member joining
so perhaps we could look at a call later that week so she can join in once her IT is sorted out.

It will be really good to have you speak with the team so thanks for offering to do this.

Please let me know whether you are ok with a call w/c 24"" Jan or whether you’d prefer to join the team in person at the
next Chesterfield training day and I’ll make arrangements.

Many thanks

JB
