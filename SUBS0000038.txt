Dear Sir Wyn Williams
POST OFFICE HORIZON ENQUIRY

We write in our capacity as the solicitors who acted for the 555 Claimants in the High Court Group
Action (“GLO Claimants”). We are not Core Participants in the Inquiry, however we felt that it may
be helpful for us to write a brief letter to the Inquiry to explain the activities that we are currently
undertaking in respect of the items listed at (9) to (12) below, being 4 of the 12 issues upon which
the Chair has requested representations.

C. Fair Compensation for the Group Litigation Claimants
9) The principles which will be applied to the calculation of further compensation payments;
10) The mechanism(s) by which further compensation payments will be calculated;

11) The provision (if any) which will be made for applicants to obtain independent legal advice in
relation to their claims;

12) The procedure(s) which will be adopted to resolve disputes about the value of further
compensation payments.

Pursuant to the ministerial announcement on 22 March 2022, Government's stated intention is that
a scheme should be established to ensure that the GLO Claimants should receive financial redress
on an equivalent basis to that available to those postmasters who were not part of the group
litigation. On behalf of individual GLO Claimants who chose to instruct us, we are consulting with
BEIS (Government Department) and Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (“JFSA”) in order to
collaborate on developing a scheme and associated arrangements that work in the interests of those
of the GLO Claimants who will instruct us. In that capacity, we shall be acting in their best interests
in respect of the outcome we shall seek on the issues listed at 9 to 12 above.

We understand that the Minister of State will write soon to the GLO Claimants in order to consult
them informally on the shape of proposals emerging from the working group. There is a strong mutual
desire to put in place arrangements and begin payments as soon as possible. We also understand
from the Department (BEIS) that it hopes to be able to provide a further update to the Inquiry at the
hearing in July.

Yours faithfully
