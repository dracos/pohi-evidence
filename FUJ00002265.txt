1 Introduction

This document defines the procedure that should be undertaken by FRES contracted
maintenance engineers when attending a Branch in order to maintain a Bureau Rate
Board that is connected to a Horizon Counter Position.

In the course of this maintenance work, it may be necessary for the engineer to
disconnect and connect Rate Boards to and from the Horizon Service Infrastructure.
This document defines the process that the engineers must follow in undertaking this
maintenance activity. The procedure described within this document is mandatory. It
is assumed that every engineer will be familiar with the use of a standard Windows PC,
and will understand how a standard PC and its peripheral devices are connected
together.

Post Office Ltd shall ensure that engineers receive ‘hands-on’ training based around
this document before undertaking the maintenance of Rate Boards that are connected
to Horizon Counter Positions.

2 Background

Previously all on demand Bureau de Change transactions had been carried out via the
Forde Money Changer (FMC). The Forde Money Changers have now been replaced.

It was decided to transfer all Bureau de Change transactions at on demand Branches to
the Horizon platform. The procedure for disconnecting a Rate Board and connecting
the Rate Board to a Horizon Counter Position is detailed in the Contract Controlled
Document entitled “Bureau Rate Board Technical Installation Guide”
(IM/MAN/023).

First Rate Exchange Services provide Rate Boards to selected Branches. In Branches
where more than one Rate Board is present, each will be connected to a separate

Horizon Counter Position.

Once on HNGX, Bureau de Change will support the only model of Rate Boards
currently in use in Branches, i.e.:

e DB7

FRTS will be responsible to Post Office Ltd for managing the maintenance of Rate
Boards.

3 Cabling

Both types of Rate Board referred to in Section 2 are connected to the Horizon
Counter Positions in Branches using the same interface and set of commands so that
the Rate Boards are fully interchangeable.

The Rate Boards are connected to the Horizon Counter Positions via a series of cables
as illustrated in Figure 1.

e The Segment J cable is used to plug directly into the rate board. This cable is
required for the DB7 models only.

e The Segment 2 cable connected directly to the end of the Segment I cable for DB7
models.

e The Segment 3 cable connects the Horizon Counter Position to the Segment 2
cable.

These cables are defined in detail in the Contract Controlled Document entitled “Rate
Board Cables” (AS/REP/013).

5 Identifying the connected Horizon Counter Position

The Branch Manager should be able to advise the engineer of the Horizon Counter
Position to which the Rate Board connects. If unsure, the Counter PC should be
labelled indicating that it has a Rate Board attached. If this label is not present, then
the appropriate Counter Position is identifiable by checking the connections at the rear
of the base units for a Rate Board Segment 3 cable connection. If the branch has more
than one Rate Board, the Rate Boards will be labelled indicating which Counter
Position they are connected to.

See Appendix A for details of where to find the Rate Board Segment 3 cable
connection on the Horizon Counter PC.

6 Identification of a Fault

Following the identification of a Rate Board fault within a Branch, the Branch
Manager should contact the NBSC, where initial help and advice will be offered. If the
problem cannot be rectified over the phone, the NBSC will advise the Branch Manager
to contact either FRES or the HSH as follows:

Type 1)

Type 2)

If the Rate Board is;
e Displaying no rates or has non-functioning/flickering cells;
e Has been damaged due to vandalism or accidental damage;
e Has visibly damaged cabling;
¢ Is damaged in any other way in which it is clear that the Rate
Board/Cabling are the only components affected;

The Branch Manager will be advised to contact FRES, requesting a FRES
contracted maintenance engineer to attend to the Rate Board.

See Section 7 for the process the maintenance engineer should follow
when rectifying a fault identified via this route.

If the Rate Board has developed a fault whereby the rates displayed on the
Rate Board do not match the rates printed on the report from the HNG-X
System for that day, whilst the Rate Board itself appears to be functioning
correctly, the Branch Manager will be advised to raise a call with the
Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH).

In this instance, the HSH will log the call and pass it to Field Maintenance
services (FMS) as a standard Priority B break-fix call. If upon attending
the site the FMS Engineer identifies that the fault is not with the Horizon
Counter Position, the FMS engineer will undertake the following action
before leaving the Branch:

¢ Power down the Rate Board.

« Disconnect the Rate Board from the Horizon Counter Position by
disconnecting the Segment 2 cable from the Segment 3 cable. The
Segment 3 cable will remain connected to the Horizon Counter
Position.

e Advise the Branch Manager to log a call with the NBSC requesting
a FRES maintenance engineer to attend to the Rate Board.

See Section 8 for the process the maintenance engineer should follow
when rectifying a fault identified via this route.

7 Rectifying a Rate Board Fault Following a Type 1 Call

When visiting a Branch to attend to a Rate Board fault identified by the Branch
Manager as a result of a fault with the Rate Board or cabling, the FRES maintenance
engineer should find the Rate Board connected to the Counter Position. The Rate
Board may or may not have been powered down by the Branch Manager.

The first step for the FRES engineer will be to check that the Segment 1 and Segment
2 cable and the Rate Board are functioning correctly (See Section 7.1).

7.1 Testing or Replacing the Segment 1 and Segment 2 Cabling

In order to test that the Segment 1 and Segment 2 cables are functioning correctly, it
may be necessary to disconnect them from the Rate Board and the Segment 3 cable.
At this stage, the Segment 3 cable MUST NOT be removed from the rear of the
Horizon Counter Position.

To disconnect the Segment I and 2 cables, ensure that the Rate Board is powered
down, and disconnect the cable at the Rate Board end. Once the Rate Board is
disconnected, locate the plug at the end of the Segment 2 Cable that is attached to the
Segment 3 cable, and decouple the two. Leave the Segment 3 cable attached to the
Horizon Counter Position. If the Segment 2 Cable cannot be disconnected from
the Segment 3 cable without moving the Horizon Counter PC then the Counter
Position MUST be shut down before this activity is carried out, following the
process detailed in Section 9.

In the instance that the testing of the Segment 1 or Segment 2 cabling identifies a fault,
the cabling should be fixed or replaced with working cabling as appropriate.

After this has been carried out (regardless of whether a cabling fault was discovered
and rectified) The FRES engineer should proceed to test that the Rate Board is
functioning correctly before re-connecting the Rate Board to the Horizon Counter
Position (see Section 7.2).

7.2 Testing or Replacing the Rate Board

The Rate Board should now be disconnected and powered down, and the maintenance
engineer should follow appropriate procedures to test the Rate Board. In the instance
that the testing of the Rate Board identifies a fault, the Rate Board should be repaired
or replaced as appropriate.

Once any identified fault with the Segment 1 or Segment 2 cabling or with the Rate
Board itself has been rectified, it will be necessary to reconnect the Segment I and
Segment 2 cables to the Rate Board, and then to connect the Segment 2 cable to the
Segment 3 cable. See Section 12 for the procedure to follow when connecting the
Segment 2 cable to the Segment 3 cable.

FUJ00002265
Fujitsu Services Bureau Rate Board Technical Maintenance Guide __ Ref: IM/MAN/024
Version: 3.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 25-Oct-2010

If no fault was identified with the Segment 1 or Segment 2 cabling, or the Rate Board
itself, it will be necessary to test the Segment 3 cable, which will involve shutting down
the Horizon Counter Position. In this instance, please refer to Section 7.3 for details
of how to proceed.

7.3 Testing or Replacing the Segment 3 Cable

If the testing of the Segment I and Segment 2 cabling, and the Rate Board itself have
failed to identify a fault, it will be necessary to test the Segment 3 cable. The Segment
3 cable will be connected to the Horizon Counter Position to which the Rate Board
will be connected. In order to test this cable, it will be necessary to shut down the
Horizon Counter Position and disconnect the cable. Please refer to Section 9 for the
procedure to shut down the Horizon Counter Position, and Section 10 for the
procedure for disconnecting the Segment 3 cable from the Horizon Counter Position.

Once the cable has been tested, and replaced if faulty, follow the procedure in Section
11 to reconnect the cable.

8 Rectifying a Rate Board Fault Following a Type 2 Call

When visiting a Branch to attend to a Rate Board fault identified by a FMS Engineer
following a call being raised with the Horizon System Helpdesk, the FRES
maintenance engineer should find the Rate Board powered down and disconnected
from the Horizon Counter Position. The Rate Board should have the Segment 1 cable
(where necessary) and the Segment 2 cable attached. The Segment 3 cable will be
connected to the Horizon Counter Position ready for re-connection.

The first step for the FRES engineer will be to check that the Segment 1 and Segment
2 cable and the Rate Board are functioning correctly (See Section 8.1).

8.1 Testing or Replacing the Segment 1 and Segment 2 Cabling

In the instance that the testing of the Segment 1 or Segment 2 cabling identifies a fault,
the cabling should be fixed or replaced with working cabling as appropriate.

After this has been carried out (regardless of whether a cabling fault was discovered
and rectified) The FRTS engineer should proceed to test that the Rate Board is
functioning correctly before re-connecting the Rate Board to the Horizon Counter
Position (see Section 8.2).

8.2 Testing or Replacing the Rate Board

In the instance that the testing of the Rate Board identifies a fault, the Rate Board
should be repaired or replaced as appropriate.

Once any identified fault with the Segment 1 or Segment 2 cabling or with the Rate
Board itself has been rectified, it will be necessary to reconnect the Rate Board to the
Segment 3 cable. See Section 12 for the procedure to follow when connecting the
Segment 2 cable to the Segment 3 cable.

If however no fault was identified with the Segment 1 or Segment 2 cabling, or the
Rate Board itself, it will be necessary to test the Segment 3 cable, which will involve
shutting down the Horizon Counter Position. In this instance, please refer to Section
8.3 for details of how to proceed.

8.3 Testing or Replacing the Segment 3 Cable

If the testing of the Segment 1 and Segment 2 cabling, and the Rate Board itself have
failed to identify a fault, it will be necessary to test the Segment 3 cable. The Segment
3 cable will be connected to the Horizon Counter Position to which the Rate Board
will be connected. In order to test this cable, it will be necessary to shut down the
Horizon Counter Position and disconnect the cable. Please refer to Section 9 for the
procedure to shut down the Counter Position, and Section 10 for the procedure for
disconnecting the Segment 3 cable from the Counter Position.

Once the cable has been tested, and replaced if faulty, follow the procedure in Section

9 Shutting Down the Horizon Counter in HNG-X

The operation of the Counter Position is the responsibility of the Branch Manager,
who should provide full assistance to the engineer in resolving the problem.

Before connecting or disconnecting a Rate Board (or any other peripherals) from the
Horizon Counter Position, the engineer must ensure that the Counter Position is shut
down and powered off. The shut down procedure is the responsibility of the Branch
Manager, however the FRES maintenance engineer should advise the Branch Manager
to perform the following checks before shutting down.

1) The manager should ensure that any user logged onto the Counter
Position to which the rate board is connected should log out. Touch the
plain grey screen until the following screen is displayed.
