Cover Letter

Dear Shareholder,
In advance of the Quarterly Shareholder Meeting (QSM) due to take place on 11** April 2024, please find

enclosed the POL progress update report.

As part of the standing agenda items this report includes an update on the four strategic priorities that
the Department would like POL to focus on in the 2024/25 financial year, being:

+ Effective financial management and performance, including management of legal costs, to ensure
medium term viability;

+ Addressing of POL’s Remediation matters and setting the business up for success in the future;
* Maintaining and improving POL’s capacity, capability, and resilience at all levels of the organisation;

+ Facilitate the sharing of information with UK Government Investments (“UKGI") and the Shareholder in
an open and transparent manner.

Whilst the QSM is a formal forum and a key mechanism in supporting the relationship between POL and
DBT, we will of course continue to keep the Department updated on progress against these specific
priorities through the regular 1:1s between the DBT Permanent Secretary/Chair and DBT Director
General/CEO.

We look forward to meeting with you soon.

Update against Shareholder strategic priorities

1. Effective financial management and performance

We continue to make progress against addressing Shareholder priorities in
maintaining effective cost management. We have maintained close monitoring of
revevanticost Challenge (with Remco. approval of the principles with
regards to achievability). There is an equivalent f cost savings identified
in the FY24/25 Business Plan. ”

The principles established by the Opex Committee around in-year prioritisation of
spend and optimisation of return will also be applied to the change portfolio.
Following on from approval of the FY24/25 Business Plan there is continuous
improvement identified in managing contracts tightly and there is consideration
of engaging external consultants to assist with the reduction of the Central Cost
base. This will complement longer term 3-5 year planning which will rely on the
outcome of any reviewed clarity from DBT on its long-term policy position.

2. Addressing of Remediation matte!

There has been good progress made by the Remediation Unit as Post Office
works hard to compensate impacted postmasters. This includes work on the
issues affecting the suspension remuneration cohort together with preparation
for the payment process review, with the aim of improving Post Office operations
in line with Mr Justice Fraser's judgements and learnings from the Post Office
Horizon IT Inquiry.

Post Office continues to prioritise engagement with the Post Office Horizon IT
Inquiry and to prepare for the upcoming phases, namely phases 5-7.

3. Maintaining and improving capacity, capability & resilience

Board have now approved the Strategic People Plan, which is focused on three areas —
improving colleague experience, improving organisational capability and becoming a
more inclusive place to work. Alongside the development of the People Plan, a
restructure of the People team is currently underway. The primary aim of the
restructuring is to ensure there is capacity within the People team to effectively support
the business through the delivery of the People Plan.

In February, sessions were delivered to colleagues across the business on the Horizon IT
scandal. The sessions covered the human impact of the scandal and how today’s
colleagues must play a role in safeguarding its culture. To follow on from the sessions,
Post Office has launched a new Ethical Decision-Making Framework and a culture self-
check for colleagues known as the ‘Yes check’.

The latest employee engagement survey has now closed with results due in mid April
and a Postmaster and Strategic Partner survey is also underway. The outputs from these
surveys will be important factors in assessing progress on culture.

4. Facilitate the sharing of information in open & transparent manner

We continue to ensure that our teams work closely and collaboratively over the
coming months, and this includes sharing information openly with UKGI, DBT,
your Permanent Secretary, Director General and other officials.

We appreciate our collaboration on business case preparations and welcome
clear and consistent alignment on priorities in moving the agenda forward
collectively.

Stakeholder Management & Governance

.

The Horizon Replacement Business Case was submitted to DBT on 18* March.

This business case will fund:
* The SPM programme until March 2026
* The development of a new Self Service Kiosk and relace of our 600 devices
* The rollout of anew mobile platform for Postmasters which will initial support bill payment
*« Anew Identity and Access Management solution

POL expect to present the business case to the DBT Investment Committee on 18* April and then to HMT for review before the
end of June. POL have received and responded to the initial Keyholder report. Some comments appear to be internally
inconsistent and do not reflect discussions with keyholders over the last 3 months. POL are concerned about the implications of
the ‘RAG’ rating which cannot now be amended.

The SPM Programme Management team are also supporting 3 different, concurrent reviews:
The IPA Gateway review which will be required to assist HMT with its funding decision
A separate review, sponsored by the Permanent Secretary and conducted by Public Digital

An external legal review of the Fujitsu extension which requires input from the SPM programme

Chris Brocklesby has submitted his SRO appointment letter to the Permanent Secretary for review and approval

POL-BSFF-111-0000007_0017
POL00448492
POL00448492

Fujitsu Extension

« POL have requested an extension of up to 5 years to March 2030 but we have still not received any formal
confirmation that that Fujitsu will agree to this despite discussions with multiple stakeholders in POL and HMG

* POL continue to work with Fujitsu to define the detail of the contract, adopting the following principles in order to
minimise the size of the extension:
* POL will adopt 3rd party contracts for services such as Payment & Banking beyond March '25 (e.g. Worldline)
* POL will directly procure software and hardware assets necessary to support Horizon resilience (e.g. Oracle
licencing)
* — Services within the overall agreement will be terminated at the earliest opportunity within the extension term

«  Analternative, such as insourcing of Horizon support, will take up to 18 months

« Fujitsu expect a formal request for an extension from HMG (rather than POL) and have suggested that all aspects
of the commercial terms are agreed before this request is made. This is planned to be June

* Considering the risk to its ongoing operation, POL need confirmation of an extension as soon as possible and
have provided David Bickerton with suggested wording that could form the basis of an immediate request

Notes on Status, Progress, and Issues: mas at: 21/3/24

Total Paid to Postmasters £156.2m (up from last time: £111.1m).

* Original HSS Applications — 2,417 Offers (100%) were issued, worth ~£112m, by the end of
November 2023.

+ Late HSS Applications — To date 1,360 late applications (+63 wow) have been received, of
which 607 have been assessed for eligibility and 538 are eligible. Of these, we have issued
259 offers, worth £14.5m.

+ Post Offer — Of 2,676 offers (~£126.5m) issued, we have received 2,218 accepts (+8 wow),
and made 2,204 payments totalling ~£102.4m after tax. To date, 136 disputes have been
resolved to resolution, of which 66 at stage 1 (prior to a Good Faith Meeting). Currently in
progress are 15 queries and 337 active disputes (a total WIP of 354, being 13.7% of responses
to date).

* Criminal Case Review Commission -700 POL convictions, of which 675 Potential Future
Appellants have been contacted. Of these, 193 appealed: of which 149 appeals had
outcomes: 92 were overturned, and 57 were unsuccessful. Additionally, 10 non-POL
convictions were overturned.

* Overturned Convictions — To date, 102 claims (93 POL + 9 other prosecutors) have been
received. These are being worked through, and to date we have paid out £40.4m, of which
£21m has been the £600k up-front offers.

+ Suspension Remuneration Review: So far, of the 2,626 eligible Postmasters we have sent
disclosure letters to 2,536 (97%), received 1,592 applications, issued 742 Offers, received 442
Accepts, and made 341 payments. 560 cases have been closed.

* Capture - We have written to DBT suggesting they appoint an independent forensic
accountant to review RU investigation work to date and perform any other due diligence work
required. This would be used to support a decision on what if any redress action is required.

+ POL Process Review: Following discussion at RC we have written to DBT asking them approve

the funding of the Pilot cases prior to the full set of funding conditions being met (e.g. process
assurance). Once this confirmation is received, we will begin the PPR pilot.

* Stamp Scheme: Offers issued on all 182 eligible claims. 167 payments made totalling £1m.

Remediation Unit (RU) Update

Strategic Priorities
+ HSS - We have now completed the original applications cohort with all offers having been issued (2,417 offers issued).

+ We have acceptances from 2,056 of those and have now been paid and settled 2,050, the remaining 361 are in our dispute resolution process having either
raised queries or not willing to accept the current offer or awaiting further details.

+ Late applications -since the Bates vs PO drama we have seen a significant uplift in volumes of late applications received, with the current number sitting at
1,360 with this being received at a rate of between c50- 100 per week. There has been a gradual reduction with last week being 38 which is the lowest
number so far this year, but absolute volume is far higher than originally expected.

+ All budgets were originally built on an estimated 350 claims received, we then moved this up to 416 which we advised last report - and since we have again
revised this up to 1,500 but again this will likely need to be increased further.

+ Following the £75k fixed sum offer announcement the provision could be insufficient depending on total volumes received which are being assessed.

+ So far, we have issued 259 applications from this population. The current pinch points are eligibility checks, and Short Fall assessments - with both areas
being resourced to deal with far lower volumes than we now are seeing - discussions are under-way to address.

+ HSS Appeal -Ahead of Phase 5 of the Inquiry we reviewed what areas in HSS we may feel we may have some vulnerabilities around early cases in HSS
delivering fair outcomes.

. These broadly fall into 4 areas and have made recommendations that both POL and by extension DBT may choose to take in response.

. The 4 areas of potential are: Consequential Loss Guidelines, De-minimis, Absence of legal advice, and Discounting for evidential uncertainty.

. We raised with DBT the option of an independent appeal mechanism - where those not happy with their outcome due to the 4 mentioned reason or indeed
anything else could potentially have their case reviewed against set criteria.

. We still await a formal position on whether a ‘Independent appeal’ will be built into the process.

. If an appeal was implemented the advantage would be to start to conclude those cases still in DRP where we do not feel they will accept their offers as
they deem them unfair but have not submitted further evidence. Clearly where they do submit new evidence, we work with them via dispute resolution
processes.

+ £75K Fixed sum offer — This was announced recently in Parliament, replicating the fixed sum offer in GLO for HSS.

+ We await formal confirmation of funding, but in the meantime have started working through the steps needed to operationalise this work. This will broadly
fall into two pieces of work i) The back book ‘top ups’ ii) New applications.

POL00448492

Post Office Limited - Document Classification: INTERNAL

Remediation Unit (RU) Update

Strategic Priorities Continued
+ Back book top ups is progressing on the data, letters and process - we expect to be able to go live during April 24 subject to a funding letter being received.

+ Modelling suggested that c166 cases currently in dispute will benefit from this top up, of which a lower number we think will settle as a result of the top —
how many we do not yet know - current thinking is c50.

+ The £75k for new applications, we are working on an abridged process to speed up assessments and offers to those who accepted this minimum payments
value.

+ HSS Closure date - Whilst we have not yet finalised governance around an end date, this is being discussed between DBT & RC as March 25 as the date the
HSS scheme will cease

+ Given the large influx of new applications we have delayed any external communications on this — but we are mindful that it will need to be agreed and then
socialised well ahead of any final closure to be fair to applicant. We expect it could lead to a spike in volumes at the point we do break cover on this.

* Tax Top Ups —- Good progress made in this space; we are now live with this work. So far, we have issued 2,213 letters (up from 334 last report) and
received 1,524 (up from 78) response and made payments to 1,078 of those totalling £7.1m. We remain well ahead of the original plan.

+ GLO - We remain slightly ahead of the disclosure plan agreed with DBT and have made good progress in this space with 334 Disclosures now completed. We
continue to work closely with the DBT GLO operational team and work with them to identify which cases need disclosure, we expect to be complete by Aug
24.

+ Overturned Convictions — Following the recent announcement of the Mass exoneration legislation at a working level we expect those cases to go via a OC2
process sitting outside of POL. But what that looks like and POL’s involvement is still forming, we expect our own involvement to be large restricted to
Disclosure work.

* OC1, We remain focused on delivering on those cases received under the existing scheme and have now fully settled 37 cases - but the volumes of new
applications received is far slower than anticipated, with claimants now having an option to wait and see what OC2 may look like we expect this theme to
continue.

+ The spectre of OC2 coming has clearly had a destabilising effect on the current POL OC team and we maintain that we have built a viable scheme that
delivers fair and reasonable outcomes. We now have Sir Gary onboarded as the independent panel for any escalations on areas of disagreement, we have
principles agreed and a functioning operating model in place and have a track record of sending outcomes that have been accepted. What we do not have is
the volumes of claims that we had hoped at this stage.

Strategic Priorities Continued

+ Restorative Justice - POL has undertaken c49 meetings with claimants across GLO, HSS and OC, (overwhelmingly GLO) in order for them to meet Senior
POL Executives (predominantly Simon Recaldin and Nick Read to date) and has received requests for c4 more days of multiple meetings that are being
planned across Q2 2024, we have also seen 2 other POL Executive members also attend these which we think is valuable to give a real insight into the impact
on these victims.

this work remains under review and ongoing, in Scotland we have again been informed that they may act if we don’t act in a timely way on disclosure for a
particular case. We are engaged with our Scottish counsel in this regard.

Detriment

+ Suspension Renumeration Review ‘SRR’ - we have now sent 2,536 disclosure letters inviting people into this scheme, have had 1,592 applications
received. Have made offers to 742 Postmasters and received 442 acceptances to those offers. With £4.7m (£2.6m) of payments.

+ Payment Process Review ‘PPR’ - funding is agreed. We expect the total cost to between £40m - £80m and currently planning to commence this work in
April 24. We are planning to commence a Pilot of 120 cases initially to test the principles, processes and provide assurance, this is awaiting DBT approval.

. Funding remains conditional on receipt of external assurance; we have requested that we can commence the pilot ahead of this being in place.

+ Capture issues - this is a legacy system that pre-dates Horizon, it was not a networked system and was effectively a spreadsheet database that helped
Postmasters reconcile their weekly returns. It was used during the 1990's.

+ So far, we have had c15-20 people come forward and claim they were impacted with issues similar to Horizon whilst using this system, and some may even
have been prosecuted.

+ We have investigated the data we do hold but given the passage of time there are gaps in that information base and so it is hard to conclude.
+ Ongoing investigations are taking place and we continue discussions with DBT on potential solutions or courses of action, it remains a live issue.

I@

1. Overview of Theme

2. Key Activities /Deliverables

Bugs, errors or defects had the potential to, and
did cause apparent or alleged discrepancies or
shortfalls relating to Sub postmasters’ branch
accounts or transactions.

Bugs, errors or defects therefore undermined the
reliability of Horizon to accurately process and
to record transactions.

The extent to which any IT system can
automatically alert its users to bugs within the
system itself is necessarily limited, and although
Horizon has automated checks which would
detect certain bugs, there are types of bugs
which would not be detected by such checks.
Indeed, the evidence showed that some bugs lay
undiscovered in the Horizon system for years

HNG-X, the first iteration of Horizon Online, was
slightly more robust than Legacy

Horizon, but still had a significant number of
bugs, errors and defects. The experts are agreed
that HNG-A is robust, and far better than it was
in either its Legacy Horizon or

HNG-X form.

HIJ Finding Theme(s): Management of Discrepancies & Shortfalls

HIJ Findings 9,14, 15

Remediation Status: In Progress

®

[ 1. Overview of Theme

2. Key Activities/Deliverables

‘SPMs had limited access to reports and data, as
well as a limited knowledge regarding POL’s
complex back-end systems. Therefore, SPMs
ability to investigate apparent/ alleged branch
shortfalls/ discrepancies was equally limited.

PMs did not have access to many reports
relating to different aspects of running a branch
(such as currency exchange, stock etc.). There
was also availability restrictions on transaction
logs (some only available for 6 weeks). SPMs
could print these out on paper till rolls, but these
were not user friendly.

Ultimately, SPMs required the cooperation of
POL to help investigate discrepancies, a term
that was also an important implied terms
identified from the Common Issues Judgment.
‘SPM cannot dispute a discrepancy, or any figure
‘on Horizon, or record on Horizon that they have
raised a dispute.

There have been over 100,000 TCs issued each
year since 2006 to counter errors due to bugs
etc. POL does not have comprehensive records
of how many TCs that have been challenged by
‘SPMs have been upheld

Transaction Acknowledgments ("Tas”) are also
used to make corrections to branch accounts —
Tas are now automated following the “Ping” fix —
a SPM has no options whether to accept Tas,
they have to be accepted in branch.

HI) Findings 8

Remediation Status: In Progress

[ 1. Overview of Theme

2. Key Activities/Deliverables

POL had access to data and systems that were
not available to SPMs via a range of Horizon
reports and POL's own management information
systems. POL could also use standard database
reporting tools to retrieve/ analyse information
about branch transactions and request audit
data from Fujitsu.

The only source of actual key stroke information
(what buttons had been pressed in branch) was
found within the Fujitsu audit data — Credence
does not provide this.

Whilst POL did have access to “the causes of
alleged shortfalls in branches, including whether
caused by bugs etc” such information had to be
obtained through Fujitsu — POL was “plainly
reliant upon Fujitsu for diagnosis of whether the
occurrence of shortfalls was caused by bugs/
errors or defects within Horizon”.

1. Overview of Themes

2. Key Activities/Deliverables

POL was heavily criticised in its lack of
support of postmasters facing
discrepancies, lack of dispute options
and oppressive loss recovery practices.

1.POL failed to support postmasters to
investigate discrepancies, or to
investigate themselves to understand the
causes

2.POL failed to be transparent about the
causes and extent, of shortfalls

3.POL needs to make decisions based on
fact and not exercise discretion
arbitrarily, capriciously or unreasonably”

4.POL must take reasonable care in
performing its functions, particularly
those which could affect the accounts

5.POL failed to allow the dispute of any
shortfall or TC from the Horicon system,
forcing postmasters to ‘accept’ the
discrepancy

6,POL made assumptions that a shortfall
was the fault of the postmaster

7.POL attempted to recover losses
without agreement or investigating

8.POL deducted from remuneration
without considering financial impact

Anew operating model was created to support postmasters with their investigation of shortfalls, or for Post Office to investigate for them

1. Overview of Themes

POL Failed to support postmasters
throughout the suspension and
termination process and asserted too
much control:

1.Suspended postmasters were
excluded from their premises and were
denied access to information

2.PMs were not paid remuneration
during the period of suspension

3.POL failed to consider ‘appropriate
period of notice’ and failed to ‘consider
relevant factors relating to

individual circumstances’

4.Cll criticised POLs right to ‘terminate
with immediate effect’ as provision in
Contract allowed POL to treat minor
breaches as though they were
repudiatory breaches

5. Ways of working ~ POL must exercise
its discretion in good faith and must not
suspend or terminate a PMs contract

a. “arbitrarily, irrationally or capriciously”;

b. without “reasonable and proper
cause”; and/or

c. in circumstances where POL was in
material breach of duty in respect of
matters which POL considered provided
the right to suspend.

1. Overview of Themes

Post Office culture was one of secrecy
and Post Office was oppressive in the
way it dealt with postmasters.

1.POL had a “Culture of secrecy and
excessive confidentiality generally ... but
particularly focussed on Horizon” and
“the subject matter of the litigation”

2.POL's approach to asserting/enforcing
its legal rights against certain Operators
as “oppressive” and found that POL
“impose{d] [the] draconian effect [of the
Contracts] upon [Operators] and
behave[d] with impunity and
coppressively”

3.CU criticised POL's relationship with
the National Federation of
Subpostmaster (NFSP). The CU found
that the NFSP was “not an organisation
independent of the Post Office” and “the
Post Office effectively controls the NFSP_
