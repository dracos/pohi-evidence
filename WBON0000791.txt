Subject: Response to Brian Altman QC's Interim Report.

Susan,

Please find attached Harry Bowyer's Response to Brian Altman QC's Interim Report. I asked Harry
to draft the response in Simon Clarke's absence given the urgency of the situation.

I would be grateful if Harry's Response could be sent to Brian Altman QC together with the
Review Protocol and Simon Clarke's Advice on Disclosure.

Kind regards,

Martin.
