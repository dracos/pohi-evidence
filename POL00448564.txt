Nick,

Having read Ben’s email attached below I am in the same place not knowing what Project Pineapple is and having never
been made aware of the allegations made against me and my team.

I therefore feel conflicted as would my wider Retail Team.
I will leave it with the legal team to construct the replies around the VOP and GFA.
Best

Martin

Future of Post Office branches

Good morning Nick

I have sent these to Sarah and Dieter to} Obvious Post Office is allowed and should meet with
Postmaster:

The Project Pineapple email contained very serious allegations of which I have not been made aware. Given the
circumstances, I would be conflicted.

Karen and Ben T — it would be helpful to have a conversation with you.

Kind regards
Ben

Nick,

Could you please organise a response after our Board tomorrow ? At least one NED has said I should meet them but I
think that would be a mistake . We do need something to say to them in our reply however . Many thanks .

Best,

Henry

Di,

Please print out VOP attachments .
Thanks ,

I work flexibly — so whilst it suits me to email outside of normal working hours, I do not expect a response during that time.

Hello Henry,

This is the suggested email to send to Board (excluding Lorna and Nick), hopefully, I have interpreted all of your emails
correctly — happy to discuss in the morning. { but should be back home by
09.1Shrs.

Dear all

Ahead of our call on Thursday, please see attached a copy of the Voice of the Postmaster Press Release for January,
together with the letter addressed to myself.

In addition, please see attached a file note I prepared following my conversation with Saf and Elliot on Sunday — [8
. They were very supportive of Nick, but you will see that the
VOP have made negative statements about Nick .

Let's talk about this on Thursday and to note I have not yet responded to VoP regarding their request for a meeting.

Regards,
Henry

PS Saf reminded me that I had omitted to mention the following : ...........

e Ihave offered the investigations team time to get the tone right and advised them to get more PM’s involved but
this seems to have been missed.

e The comms has been poor throughout our tenure within the business.

e The GE have overlooked advice given to them by board members on several occasions without clear
explanations.

Hi Henry
This echoes very much the comments that we discussed on Sunday - clearly we are not losing the plot and real
action is essential.
