| noticed that the figures were regularly wrong and just wouldn’t balance. | would
pull my hair out not being able to understand why.

16.At first, | thought it was me making the mistakes and | repaid the initial shortfalls.

17.| phoned the helpdesk about the discrepancies in the beginning. Their attitude
was always “it will bounce back”, which | found very frustrating and unhelpful.

18.An auditor visited and | recall them saying that | can’t leave £2,000 in the
suspense account; they told me to take the money and keep it myself. | said to
him | couldn’t do that - it was the Post office’s money, and it was a reputable
place to work.

19.| had various other audits before the main one in 2005, and as mentioned above

| repaid any shortfall found at audit with my own money. | cannot recall the

amount of the discrepancies at this stage as it was all such a long time ago.

were running the post office. | was doing the weekly balance based on their

THE HUMAN IMPACT
28.The human impact which the failings of the Horizon IT System have had and
continue to have upon me and my family are set out in the remainder of this
statement. The section headings follow the particular questions posed by the

Inquiry.

WHAT WERE THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEING REQUIRED TO MAKE GOOD
APPARENT SHORTFALLS SHOWN BY THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM?
29.As mentioned above, the shortfalls were small at first and | regularly had to use
my own money to cover these.
30. The shortfalls were getting bigger and | could not afford to keep repaying them.
31.1 had to take an evening job doing bar work as well as my day job at the cigarette
vending machine company. | was exhausted from working so many hours.

32.1 also used my own takings from the shop to rectify the shortfalls.

WHAT WERE THE COSTS OF MAKING GOOD ALLEGED SHORTFALLS
SHOWN BY HORIZON?
33.1 would estimate that out of my own pocket | put in around £13,000 in total to

cover the initial ad-hoc shortfall amounts.

WITNO01500100

34. Following the audit in 2005, | was told that | would have to pay a further shortfall
of £13,000 back. | had to take a loan out of £37,784 to cover the shortfall, my
living expenses and mortgage, believing | would be able to work and repay it.

35. It took so long to get to court | had to use the loan money to pay the mortgage
and my family’s living expenses.

36.As the case proceeded to court, my barrister informed me that the shortfalls
were in excess of £17,000. He advised me to pay it before court, but | realised
the loan | took out didn’t cover the shortfalls in addition to my living expenses
and mortgage. Instead | had to take our a further loan of £20,000 to pay the

shortfall.

HOW WERE YOU AFFECTED WHEN ALLEGED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
SHORTFALLS OR DISCREPANCIES SHOWN BY THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM?
37.As mentioned above, two auditors visited the office and they implied that | had
taken the £13,000 which made me feel awful and very upset.
38.The whole situation caused me a huge amount of stress.
39.1 had so much on my plate, with the shop and my children; | thought the
shortfalls were due to my mistakes.
40.The whole experience was shocking. | couldn’t believe what was happening

and | just thought it was a big misunderstanding.

WHAT WERE THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR
SHORTFALLS AND DISCREPANCIES SHOWN BY THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM?
41.1 was invited to attend an interview. | can’t remember exactly what happened,

they just bombarded me with “this is wrong, and that is wrong”. They said

money was going missing. | said | haven’t taken any money and | didn’t know
why it was going wrong.

42. After the interview | was suspended without pay. As mentioned above, | had to
use the loan money to live on.

43.At the time, my husband was an artist and he was not often able to contribute
financially. We had taken the children out of school and he was home schooling
them.

had less income. | had to hand in my notice at the cigarette vending machine
company when | knew | was going to court.

employ me whilst | was under investigation.

WHAT WERE YOUR FINANCIAL LOSSES CAUSED BY ACTION TAKEN
AGAINST YOU IN RELIANCE UPON HORIZON DATA?
48.As detailed above, due to the financial pressure | was in from the identified

was a high interest unsecured loan. Subsequently | had to take out a further
loan of £20,000.00. | also had to use various credit cards as a result of the Post
Office’s actions.

sons do not lose their home.
