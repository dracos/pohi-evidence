1 Schedule of Agreement

This document comprises a schedule of agreement reflecting the understanding and

We have agreed the submission of the ‘Addendum to the Technical expert’s report to
the Court prepared by Chalres Alastair McLachlan’ on 11" October 2010 without

contention.

We have agreed the submission of the Technical expert’s report to the Court
prepared by Charles Alastair McLachlan on 4" October 2010 and in particular

Section 4 subject to the following agreed changes:

1.1 Section 4.4 should have the following sentence appended: “Therefore we are
both agreed that the revaluing of foreign currency is not an issue at West
Byfleet”

1.2 At Section 4.9 an additional paragraph should be appended as follows:

“Therefore, we are both agreed that the transaction of £7,000 is not an example of the
problems with the Fast Cash button and that, the total value of failed debit
transactions of less than £1,000 between Dec06 and Dec07 is insufficient to explain

the discrepancies at West Byfleet”

1.3. At Section 4.12 an additional paragraph should be appended as follows:

this should be resolved by the sub postmaster when reconciling at the end of the

period.”

1.4 At Section 4.15 the sentence “My understanding is that all Horizon data...”
should read “My understanding is that all Horizon transactions...” The
sentence beginning “Certainly the information...” should now read “Certainly
all the information is collected by the Horizon system as per the specification
of Post Office Limited; however, variance checks, despite being collected, are

not passed through to the central reporting systems.”
