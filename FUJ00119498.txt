GENERAL TESTING POLICY Version: 1.0
Date: 01/05/96

1, CONTEXT

1.1 This policy is consistent with the Pathway Quality Policy, and applies to all Testing and
Integration activities conducted within Pathway Development Programmes, whether in-
house or sub-contracted. Where shareholders or sub-contractors have their own Testing
or Integration policies already in place, and where these have been agreed by the Pathway
Director of Programmes and Director of Quality and Risk Management as being
sufficient and appropriate, then these may replace this policy.

1.2 Pathway will seek confirmation from suppliers and sub-contractors that their own Quality
Management System is adequate and appropriate. Pathway will be party to and seek to
influence their supporting working practices in order to minimise the risk of receiving
poor quality deliverables and to promote product consistency.

1.3 This policy, or the agreed substitute policy, should be used as one of the primary source
documents in reviewing Pathway Testing or Integration Strategies as and when produced,
whether in-house or sub-contracted.

1.4 This policy should be reviewed periodically in accordance with the process improvement
objectives as specified in the Pathway Quality Management System.

2. RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1 The responsibility for the Testing Policy lies with the Director of Programmes and must
be approved by the Director of Quality and Risk Management..

2.2 All Parties, Pathway staff and sub-contractors, have responsibility for complying with the
Testing Policy.

3. TESTING POLICY

3.1 The overall objective of Testing and Integration activities in a Development Programme
is to ensure delivery of high quality systems, demonstrably proven to be fit for service.
That is, to progressively test and integrate the products and reduce their defect content to
an established level of acceptability, agreed on a cost versus risk basis.

3.2 This will be achieved by agreeing at the outset with the Programme and the Customers a
set of unambiguous and measurable test objectives with corresponding test success
criteria. These should be based on established Acceptance Criteria, and cast in terms of
specific test coverage, error rates, conformance to standards, timescales and budgets.

3.3 The overall approach to be employed in testing and integrating the products will be
agreed with the Programme and the Customers in a high level strategy document. Where
any additional external certification of hardware or software may be required, this will be
highlighted in the strategy.

3.4 Specific test coverage will be defined via a formal structured test planning methodology,
and documented and agreed in subordinate test strategies, logical level test plans and
physical level test scripts, subject to review by the Programme and the Customers as
appropriate. In general, and unless otherwise specified, a distinction will be made
between bespoke products and standard proprietary hardware and software. Bespoke
products will be subject to the full rigour of formal test planning, whereas these ‘off the
shelf? ‘shrink wrapped’ products will be assumed to function as declared by the
manufacturer, and will not be subjected to specifically engineered tests, but rather will be
‘used’ in context through the mainstream testing to confirm that they deliver those
services and facilities required of them by the Pathway system.

3.5 Tests will be classified as mandatory or optional, based on their relationship with the
agreed Acceptance Criteria, and prioritised accordingly on a cost versus risk basis, by
agreement with the Programme and the Customers. Test execution will be planned and
defect removal will proceed on the basis of these priorities. All mandatory tests will be
scripted and executed in a re-runable manner.

3.6 Defects are judged to arise where the products under test exhibit behaviour contrary to or
outside the agreed requirement. Defect removal will follow rejection of defective
components under test, where they fail to meet the agreed Acceptance Criteria, and will
be demonstrated by the iterative re-testing of corrections.

3.7 Defects will be formally recorded and monitored against a model of projected errors for
the products under test.

3.8 Testing progress will be formally recorded and monitored against plan.

3.9 Proof of testing will be secured to establish a full audit trail of the process.
