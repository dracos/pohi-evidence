POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

TENTH WITNESS STATEMENT OF SIMON RECALDIN

1. 1, Simon Recaldin, of 100 Wood Street, London EC2V 7ER, will say as follows:
INTRODUCTION
2. The facts in this witness statement are true, complete and accurate to the best
of my knowledge and belief. Where my knowledge and belief, as set out in this
witness statement, has been informed by another person or by documents that
I have reviewed, I acknowledge that person or those documents. I have been
assisted in preparing this witness statement by Burges Salmon LLP and
Fieldfisher LLP (together "BSFf"), who act on behalf of Post Office in the Post

Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the “Inquiry").

3. I am employed by Post Office Limited (“Post Office”) as the Director of the
Remediation Unit and I have held this role since 10 January 2022. My line

manager is Post Office’s Interim Chief Operating Officer.

4. I make this witness statement in response to a request dated 13 February 2025
for information pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006. Further to my sixth
(WITN09890600), seventh (WITN09890700) and eighth (WITN09890800)
witness statements, the Inquiry has requested supplemental data relating to the

Horizon Shortfall Scheme (“HSS”) and the Overturned Convictions Process

Page 1 of 10
WITNO09891000
WITNO09891000

(‘OC Process’). For completeness, I have adopted the same terminology and

definitions used in my previous witness statements.

5. Post Office has provided data in line with the headings supplied in the Rule 9
request which split the data by date of claims made. Accordingly, Post Office
has used the date of when the application was received as opposed to when

the offer was made by Post Office, or received, by the applicant.

6. As set out in my sixth (WITN09890600) and seventh (WITN09890700) witness
statements, in response to Rule 9(56) and (59) respectively, there are various
reasons why certain applications take different lengths of time to progress
through certain stages of the process. The progress of a number of these
stages is entirely in Post Office's hands. I have set out the steps Post Office
has taken to speed up these stages in my witness statements and oral evidence
(and latterly in the update shared with the Inquiry on 1 November 2024).
However, sometimes an application takes more time to progress through one
of the stages for reasons outside of Post Office’s control. A commentary on the
data and factors impacting timescales has not been requested in this Rule 9
however, Post Office is happy to provide further information if it would be of

assistance to the Inquiry.

7. Also, as requested by the Inquiry, I exhibit to this statement the five letters sent
to public interest Claimants on 25 January 2024", as referred to at paragraph

37 of my seventh witness statement (WITN09890700).
