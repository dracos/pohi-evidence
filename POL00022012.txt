Hi Jonathan — my detailed comments are set out in the attached. Two big points, though:

1) The intro section needs to be re-worked a bit to make it clear that this report focuses mainly on the legal liability
point, and that you will be working with us in relation to alternative structures (and may be not even producing
a report). The reason for this is that some board members think that the task of coming up with alternatives to
the scheme should be an internally driven bit of work, not something that is outsourced to a law firm.

2) The executive summary is still pretty long, and doesn’t hit the reader between the eyes with what I understand
to be your main conclusion — namely: Unless there is something wrong with the system, we are entitled to rely
on the accounts produced by Horizon as the basis of claiming sums of money from SPMRs. Further that there
can be no question of a claim for consequential losses based simply on the recovery by the Post Office of losses
if the losses were properly payable and the Post Office was entitled to the money.

These 2 statements together are quite powerful, and need to be brought our clearly, and it also needs to be said
that in consequence the amounts that could be successfully claimed in court are a fraction of the aggregate
amounts (c£100m) that has been claimed under the scheme.

I would be most grateful if you could turn this round asap in the morning.
Cheers

Chirs

Chris

As discussed, I attach our draft report on the legal issues.

There is a factual question that we would like you to confirm in paragraph 5.22 (and a related question in 5.37), but
otherwise please provide any comments you may have in the time available and we will send through a finalised version
as soon as possible in the morning.

In the interests of time, I have left in the outline of “Part B” of the report in this document so that, as requested, you can
see where that part is headed. I will remove it (i.e. everything from section 6 onwards) in the final version for the Board
we send through tomorrow.

Kind regards
