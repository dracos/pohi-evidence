I'll get the dial in over to OEC.

I won't dial in unless you tell me too.

Note with you early morn’ - I'll try and get Gideon to bless the text first but if that builds in delay I'll get a draft over to

you in any event.

Thanks — dial in details below, and yes, I’ll open.

Yes - my notes were taken during the con yesterday. I’ll send them over and if they’re helpful (and you can
read them!) great; if not, you have yours! Timing is fine and maybe check with Gideon that he agrees with
them? I’m sure the board would prefer a settled note, but I’m not sure there’s time.

Thanks

Call. Noted. 11.45 sharp.

Do you want POL dial in details from Diane or shall I sort ? If I sort I think I need to be on call as "chair" to open up the
call and you may want AGQC solo as a new voice as we discussed (and I fully get that).

In terms of AGQC note of advice, yes can do. No probs. I have notes too. I assume you mean notes of the conference
we had rather than the one to come tomorrow ?

WBONO0001785_0002
I can get notes done this eve and circulated early tomorrow latest. Would that work ?

Call (not video) will go ahead tomorrow — at least 2 directors, I’m hoping for more.

Strong request on behalf of our shareholder director for a very short summary of Grabiner’s advice — is that
something you can pull together? I took detailed notes which I could scan across to you if that would be

helpful?
