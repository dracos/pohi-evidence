modifications necessary to ensure such continued compliance subject to Clause 12.1 of this
Agreement. Fujitsu Services shall give advance written notice to Post Office of any such
maintenance and/or modification work required under this paragraph. Post Office shall not
withhold its consent under Clause 12.1 if to do so would cause Fujitsu Services to fail to comply
with any such subsequent legislation. Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to recover from Post
Office the Fujitsu Service Cost (charged on an Open Book basis) of maintenance and/or
modifications required to ensure such continued compliance under this paragraph (which
includes, without limitation, continued compliance with relevant or subsequent legislation or

the matter shall be treated in accordance with Clause 70.

2.1.3. Fujitsu Services shall ensure that, where the installation of Equipment or the provision of

confirm or deny that the Confidential Information in question is held by Post Office.

2.9.3 Post Office shall not, subject to paragraph 2.9.7:

2.9.3.1 if and to the extent the Parties agree that paragraph 2.9.2 (i) applies in respect of any
request, disclose the Confidential Information requested; and

of any request, confirm or deny that the Confidential Information in question is held by
Post Office.

2.9.4 In the event the Parties do not agree whether (i) to confirm or deny that the Confidential

would be materially detrimental to its public reputation and this materially outweighs
any damage to Fujitsu Services’ commercial interests which would arise as a result of
such disclosure; or

2.9.6.2 Post Office has received a written opinion from legal counsel experienced in FOIA
related matters (a copy of such opinion to be provided, for information only without
