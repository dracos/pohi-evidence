Brian to e mail Shaun Turner to request C&SM_ I ASAP
that Horizon kit is checked/replaced to try
to eliminate problems currently being
experienced in the office.

EXPAND ON ANY LETTER REQUESTEDI/CLARIFY ANY POINT
As instructed by APM, I visited the branch to go over the Audit Report of 8
Dec 2005. Brian Trotter, C&SM was with me during the visit.

Discussed the report fully with the Spmr and the recommendations that had
been made by the audit team. The Spmr is aware of his responsibilities
and agreed to complete the training records as outlined in Appendix A
relating to AML & FS. All issues in Appendix B were discussed and I am
satisfied that the Spmr has taken the necessary steps to rectify.

We discussed the problems that had been encountered in September with
the Horizon system and the more recent recurrence. Alan (Spmr) showed
Brian and myself the balance snapshots from 5.01.06, showing the
problems with the communication between nodes. I have already
contacted Shaun Turner asking for help to rectify the system problems, and
Brian has agreed that he will also e mail him reiterating the need for the
system to be checked or the kit replaced.
