Has the claim already been barred / determined so that legal proceedings 100% Not known

No

Is there the possibility of an unlawful termination claim because the 100% Not known
Applicant's contract was not terminated on proper notice?

Yes

Was contract termination unlawful? 0% £0

The Applicant admitted to false accounting so there is no evidence that the
termination was unlawful

Suitability for mediation

All indications point to the losses being a result of user error, mismanagement and/or theft. There is no
evidence to suggest that the losses in the branch were caused by Horizon. Therefore, we do not
consider this case suitable for mediation.

Advice qualifications

41 This advice has been produced by applying the principles set out in the Advice from Linklaters
dated 20 March 2014.

2 No further legal analysis of the underlying legal principles has been carried out, in particular we

have not considered any other possible legal bases for the Applicant's claims including without limitation
malicious prosecution, defamation, malicious falsehood, breach of confidence, tortious causes of action
or privacy law.

3 We have not analysed the possibility that failures by Post Office in training or supporting the
Applicant, or subsequently investigating losses, may have contributed to the Applicant's ability to
prevent losses in branch.

4 Our advice is based on only the information in the Applicant's Case Questionnaire Response,
the Post Office Investigation Report and Second Sight's Case Review Report. Our advice does not
factor in the possibility of further information being available at a later date that may change our
analysis.

5 We have not considered the Applicant's appetite or capacity to bring proceedings against POL
or any of the "other" factors set out in the settlement mandate.

6 We have not considered any criminal law issues or whether any conviction / sentence may be
unsafe. We have assumed that there are no criminal law risks.

7 We have applied a de minimis threshold to legal risk. Where the legal risk is very small (less
than 20%) we have recorded this as 0% in our analysis.

8 If this matter was to proceed to Court there is a risk that a judge, without the appropriate
expertise or knowledge, may find it persuasive that the discrepancies stopped when the telephone line
was disconnected. This is an inherent risk with any litigation.
