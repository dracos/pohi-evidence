SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION
6. On Thursday the 11" September 2008, a criminal investigation was started in England and Wales into
Offences of theft and false accounting. In connection with the investigation, I have been informed by Gary
Thomas, the officer in charge of the criminal investigation, and believe that: ~
a) The defendant was the Subpostmaster at Astwood Bank Sub Post Office, 1248 Evesham Road,
Redditch, B96 6AD. The defendant had been in post since the 7" November 2002.

b) An audit of the office accounts on the 11” September 2008 revealed a cash shortage of
£27,811.28. As a result of the audit shortage, the defendant was precautionary suspended from his

position as Subpostmaster.
) On the 15" September 2008, Post Office Investigators interviewed the defendant under caution.

d) During that interview the defendant made admissions to inflating his cash figures and false

accounting at the end of each accounting period to cover up shortfalls in the office accounts.
e) The defendant stated he had been falsifying the office accounts for approximately 5 years.
f) Gary Thomas is still carrying out further investigations.

7. I believe that there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant has benefited from his particular

criminal conduct to at least £27,811.28.

REALISABLE PROPERTY

8. I have made preliminary enquires into the financial affairs of the defendant and it is to my knowledge
that:-

a) The defendant is a 58 year old male’ residing with his wife at

registered title number of this property is and is in the joint names of the defendant and his wife,

Karen Lynette WILSON.

b) The property, which is believed to be valued in the region of £245,000.00, is mortgaged with the GE Money
Home Finance Ltd, The outstanding balance is approximately £109,600.00.

c) It is believed that the defendant owns the lease on the business premises at 1248 Evesham Road, Redditch,

B96 6AD, which is the site of the Post Office and retail store. The value of the lease is unknown.

d) Enquiries have revealed that the defendant has access to the following bank accounts:

ccount number: in the joint names of Mr & Mrs Wilson

I. Lloyds TSB, sort code
(Platinum A/C), the current balance is approximately £1,047.00 in credit.

I Lloyds TSB, sort code 3 account number 7} also in the joint names of Mr and Mrs
Wilson (Astwood Bank PO Current A/C), the current balance is approximately £3,700.00 in credit.

Ill, National Savings and Investments, Easy Access savings account in the joint names of Mrs K L & Mr J

e) The defendant has a personal loan with Lloyds TSB and the outstanding balance is approximately

£14,700.00.

f) The defendant has a business loan agreement for £60,000.00 with Lloyds TSB, the account number is

“} sort code

@) The defendant is the registered keeper of a vehicle, Volvo V70 Classic Auto, Registration number’

which has an approximate value of £2,500.00.

EXTENT OF BENEFIT

9. I believe that the defendant has a criminal lifestyle through having committed a criminal lifestyle offence. This

is because:

I believe that the defendant has committed an offence(s) over a period of at least six months and has
benefited from this offence in total of not less than £5,000. (During interview the defendant admitted to false

accounting for 5 years to cover a shortage in the office accounts of £27,811.28)
10, The enquiry is at an early stage and the extent of benefit is not yet known.

411. It is, therefore, my opinion that this is a case in which the court may apply the assumptions under section 10

of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 when assessing the extent of the benefit from criminal conduct.

12. In so far as I arm aware, no civil proceedings have been commenced on behalf of any person that might be

said to have sustained loss arising out of the commission of the alleged offence(s).

43. I believe that if a restraint order is not made there is a real risk that the assets listed below will be dissipated.
This is because of the serious nature of the alleged offences and the amount of public money involved. The

defendant has a mortgage debt of over £109,000.00, as well as business and personal loans that total

POL00050498

approximately £74,000.00. Further to this the defendant could reduce the equity in his assets by securing
further charges against them and I am not convinced that any such funds would be held to service any

future confiscation order.
ORDERS SOUGHT
Restraint Order

14. I therefore seek a Restraint Order against Jullan WILSON in respect of the following assets which, to the best

of my ability, I am able to particularise as follows: -

a) The lease on the business premises at 1248 Evesham Road, Redditch, B96 6AD.

b) The property known as The registered title number of this property is

©) Vehicle, Volvo V70 Classic Auto, Registration number {

account number in the joint names of Mr & Mrs Wilson

d) Lloyds TSB, sort code {~
(Platinum A/C), the current balance is approximately £1,047.00 in credit.

i, also in the joint names of Mr and Mrs Wilson

e) Lloyds TSB, sort code
(Astwood Bank PO Current A/C), the current balance is approximately £3,700.00 in credit.

i, account numbe

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.
