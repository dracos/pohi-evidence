Introduction

Introduction

Introduction to the Horizon System User Guide

The booklets in the Horizon System User Guide (the Guide) contain descriptions of the procedures
you must follow to use the Horizon system (the system)

The instructions are written in a similar style to Counter News and the Counters Operations
Manual, with the addition of flow-charts to help you follow the procedures.

This Guide does not replace either Counter News or the Counters Operations Manual. It contains

instructions for using the system, with very little detailed information about products, about the

manual elements of accounting for products or about the rules you must follow when accepting
cash or cheques. Therefore you must use the Guide in conjunction with Counter News and the
Counters Operations Manual.

Structure of the Guide

The Guide consists of ten booklets with procedures arranged, as far as possible, in the order you
will find them working from the system desktop :

one navigation booklet containing:

- a table of contents for the entire Guide
- an index for the entire Guide
- a glossary of terms that you are likely to come across when using the system

two administration booklets:

- Office Administration containing information about setting up the system for
use in your office; for example adding and deleting users

= System Administration containing information about the basics of using the
system; for example logging on and off and using picklists

three booklets about using the system to serve customers:

- Transactions - Serving Customers - Part one containing information about
serving customers with Automated Payment products

- Transactions - Serving Customers - Part two containing information about
dealing with OBCS and non-OBCS pensions and allowances, Bureau de
Change transactions and other receipt and payment transactions

- Transactions - Serving Customers Part three containing information about
postal revenue transactions, using the scales, stock transactions, what to do if

for

sociated with serving customer:

the system fails and other procedures a:
example printing receipts and local schemes

two booklets about using the system for transactions other than serving customers:

- Transactions - Other - Part one containing information about dealing with
transfers and remittances

- Transactions - Other - Part two containing information about losses and gains,
reversals other than AP reversals, recording parcel traffic ete.

one reports booklet containing information about reports available on the system and how to
obtain them

one balancing booklet containing information about balancing your office using the system.

Special paragraph styles used in this guide

We have used special paragraph styles in this guide to help you follow the procedures. The main
styles are:

Major bullet points

Major bullet points can be identified by the large dot at the beginning of the line (see illustration
below).

@ This is a major bullet point
They describe the main procedure. In most cases procedures can be completed by following major
bullet points.
Minor bullet points

Minor bullet points can be identified by the small dot at the beginning of the line (see illustration
below).

* This is a minor bullet point

They will normally occur after you have had to make a decision about something and describe
exceptions to the main procedure; for example what to do if things go wrong.

Introdution

Introduction

This booklet contains information about the office administration functions of the Horizon system.

Office administration using Horizon means management of information held on the system about
the identity of a user or a stock unit (for example user names or Stock Unit IDs), together with
other administrative functions you must perform to use the system

For information about printing administration reports see Reports; Administration reports.

The User Administration section includes information about how to add a new user, change a
password, delete or modify a user etc.

The Stock Unit Administration section includes information about attaching users to stock units,
creating stock units etc.
The System Failure section includes instructions for identifying lost EPOSSS transactions, recovery

procedures etc.

The Equipment Information and Maintenance section covers areas such as care of the equipment
and ordering and installing consumables.

Information about the Horizon System Helpdesk, the Network Business Support Centre and the
Memo View facility are contained in the Miscellaneous section.

Office Administration

User administration
Subsection I

User administration

I Security and access

1.1 Security guidelines
Bear in mind the following points at all times when using the system:

* Any misuse of the system could mean that you are committing a criminal offence, for which
you could be prosecuted and/or disciplined

* Users are accountable for any actions undertaken with their user name and password

* Users are responsible for ensuring that their password is kept private and not revealed to any
other person

* All existing security checks must still be applied (the system does not do away with the need for
vigilance)

* Features of the system, espe irity, must be treated as business-sensitive information,

and not discussed outside the workplace

* Screens should not be placed so that they can be seen by customers
* Redundant (ie users no longer working in your office) users must be deleted from the system

* Users must invoke the temporary lock or log out from the system if the workstation is out of
sight, or if they are not going to use it immediately (see System Administration; Accessing the
system; Logging on and logging out and System Administration; Accessing the system;
Temporary locking of a session).

* Always report any breach of security arising as a result of the implementation of Horizon to the
Horizon System Helpdesk

Please remember: None of the above replaces your current contractual liabilities.

1.2 Full Name
When entering names into the Horizon system to update the list of users:

- Atleast one character must be entered in both fields

- The system does not allow the entry of more than one first name

- No spaces can be entered to the first name field

- The maximum number of characters in either field is 16 (this means that if the name is too
long to fit in the box it should be truncated if it exceeds 16 characters)

- Names cannot be changed after the user has been set up

Horizon System User Guide
Office Administration

User administration
Subsection I

User administration

1.3. User names

Whenever you need to use the Horizon system, you must identify yourself by entering your user
name. Your user name is unique within your office. It will allow you to access information and to
change what you are authorised to change, but will prevent you from accessing or accidentally
changing anything else.

* Never allow others to use your user name

it is only for your use)

* Do not use, or attempt to use, any user name that has not been issued to you personally

* Always log out when you have finished using the system to prevent others from using your user
name

* User names must be six characters long.

Make up of user names
User names are made up as follows:

- your first initial
- the first two letters of your surname

- anumber, which will always be 001, unless there is, or has been, an identical user ID

For example: — The first Elvis Presley to be a user in your office would take the user name EPROO1.

If there is a second Elvis Presley or an Ella Presley, the last number must be
incremented by 1, making them EPROO2 on the Horizon system.

The user name cannot contain spaces or more than two successive duplicate characters.

If using the user's first initial and the first two letters of their surname gives more than two
successive characters that are the same, the third duplicate character must be omitted, and the third
character from the user's surname used instead.

For example: Linda Llewellyn must be entered as LLEOO1 on the system.

If the next numeric character in the current sequence leads to three repeated numeric characters,
the third duplicate character should be omitted and the next number in the sequence used instead.

For example: — The number 111 would be omitted and the number 112 used instead.

Teller ID field

No entry must be made in the Teller ID field.

Subsection I

User administration

1.4 Passwords

Efficient and tightly controlled use of passwords is essential to system security and is an area for
which all users of the system must take responsibility.

A password expires after 30 days.

Conditions of passwords
A password must:

= be private, user-selected, and not revealed to anyone

- be changed immediately if it has been allocated by someone else (ie when the user is first
introduced to the system), if it is modified or if the message ‘Must Change Password’ appears

- be changed regularly and may only be re-used after 12 changes of password

= contain a minimum of six characters and a maximum of fourteen (14) characters, at least one
of which must be a number

A password can not:

- be the same as the user name or be among the excluded words that are programmed into the
system

= use obvious words, for example, 'Password’or 'Secret’

- contain spaces or more than two successive duplicate characters

- be changed more than once within 24 hours

Control of passwords
+ Change your password at regular intervals

* Change your password immediately if you suspect that someone else knows it

Please note: The system will not allow you to change your password more than once in any 24
hour period. If you have recently changed your password and you suspect that
someone else knows your new password you must continue to work normally and
change your password as soon as the 24 hour period has elapsed.

+ Ensure you are not observed when you enter or change your password

+ Use the temporary lock or log out of the system if the workstation is out of your sight or if you

are not going to use your workstation immediately (see System Administration; Accessing the
system; Logging on and logging out and System Administration; Accessing the system;

Temporary locking of a session)
* Never write down your password.

Please note: No one should ask you for your password; not even the Horizon System Helpdesk.
Report any request of this nature through the normal Post Office Counters Ltd
security and investigation channels.

Groups
Your level of access to the system is determined by your group membership.

- Engineer: able to diagnose system faults only

- Auditor: access only for auditing purposes

- Auditor E: access to full managerial functions plus final accounting facilities, permissible only
in emergency situations (ie as

istance in change of office management)

- Support: can only create users

- Managers: access to all counter functions and administration (user administration is restricted
to this group)

- Supervisors: access to all counter functions, but no administrative access except to stock units.

- Clerk: access to all the counter functions, but with no administrative access

- Setup: operational only on initialisation of the system only, has administrative access in order
to create a manager user

- Migration: allows access to the functions used to setup up the office when Horizon is first
installed

Please note: — Groups not appropriate for office use (for example, engineer, auditor, auditor E,
support and setup) cannot be allocated to new or existing users.
These groups can only be assigned during the system start-up process for agreed
user names.

You as a user can be a member of only one of the above groups. You will be able to gain access to
functions on the system according to the level of group access you have been allowed.

If you are not a member of the group, all functions in that group will be padlocked except Logout.

12 Equipment Failure Checklist (dealing with equipment
failure)

When you experience a problem with equipment, there are a number of checks that you must
make before calling the Horizon System Helpdesk

Please note: If any of these initial checks fails, call the Horizon System Helpdesk see subsection
19; Help Desks.

+ Please follow the actions below carefully, according to the relevant equipment failure:

12.1 Processor failure

When the processor has failed:

* Check whether the processor is receiving power.

Please note: __If the processor is not receiving power, it is silent and displays no green lights on

the front panel.

If the power cable has become unplugged or pulled loose from the mains supply at the wall

socket:

* Reconnect the power cable

* Restart the workstation (node) see System Administration; System initialisation; Restarting a
workstation or see System Administration; System initialisation; Replacement of a Gateway
workstation.

If possible:

+ Check whether the power cable has become unplugged or pulled loose from the processor

* If this has occurred, call the Horizon System Helpdesk.

Please note: — Do not try to reconnect the power cable in this instance.

If the cable connections are correct but the processor is silent and displaying no lights:

* Check whether the processor's on/off switch has been switched off. This may happen, for
example, if the switch is knocked accidentally. If the processor is switched off, press the on/off
switch to switch it back on, see System Administration; System initialisation; Restarting a
workstation

+ Check whether the monitor screen is plugged into the processor and is displaying a green light
above its on/off switch (in which case the processor is faulty), if this is the case call the
Horizon System Helpdesk.

If the processor is displaying lights but appears not to be operating:

+ Check whether the light nearest the on/off switch (on the right hand side of the processor)
which indicates that the processor is switched on and is receiving power, remains steadily on

System failure

Subsection 12

System failure

* Check whether the light next to the power light, which indicates computer activity, is in one of
the following conditions:

- flashing on and off in bursts of activity (this will happen when the processor has just been
switched on and is preparing itself for use)
- flashing briefly from time to time (this will happen when the processor is ready for use)

+ Make a note of the condition of the lights since you will need to relay this information to the
Horizon System Helpdesk

* Call the Horizon System Helpdesk.

If you need to carry out transactions and the processor is still not working:

* Check whether there is another workstation on which you can complete the transaction.

If there is another workstation available:

* Complete the transaction using the other workstation.

If another workstation is not available:
* Complete the transaction manually without entering any information onto the system

+ Recover the transactions when the workstation is restored, using the relevant fallback
procedure.

12.2, ISDN (Horizon telephone communication connection) line faults
When you experience difficulty with the ISDN communication line:

* Check whether the ISDN Network Termination Equipment (NTE) box is displaying a green
light.

Please note: The NTE box is the grey BT box (telephone point) about six by four inches in size
fixed to the wall of your office.
If the light on the NTE box is not on:

* Call the Horizon System Helpdesk,

If the light on the NTE box is on:

* If your office has a hub which forms the Local Area Network (LAN), check that this is
displaying at least three green lights.

Please note: — The hub is mounted on the inside lid of a small steel cabinet which is positioned
approximately one metre from the floor, close to the ISDN point.
If any of the lights are not on:

* Call the Horizon System Helpdesk

If the lights are on:
+ Check whether the ISDN/LAN cables have become loose or disconnected.

Ifa cable is loose or disconnected:

* Call the Horizon System Helpdesk.

Please note: — Do not try to reconnect the power cable in this instance.

If you need to make a payment for the Order Book Control Service and the ISDN (NTE) fault
has not been rectified:

* Follow the manual procedures for encashment see Transactions - Serve Customer - Part two;
OBCS Pension & Allowances; OBCS during system failure.

12.3. Monitor (including touch screen) failure
When the monitor/touch screen has failed:

+ Check whether a green light is visible below the right hand corner of the screen (this light
indicates whether the monitor is switched on).

Please note: Even though the screen may not be working, the keyboard may still function.
Make sure that you do not accidently press any keys on the keyboard as this will
register on the system.

If the green light is not on:

* Check that the power switch by the light is in the ’on’ position

* Leave the power switch in the ‘on’ position

+ If possible, check whether the cable between the screen and the processor has been unplugged

or has pulled loose.

If the cable is loose or disconnected:

* Call the Horizon System Helpdesk

Please note: — Do not try to reconnect the power cable in this instance.

* Check whether the processor is working correctly by performing the processor checks (see

paragraph 12.1; page 39).
Please note: — The power for the monitor is supplied from the processor so if the processor is not
powered, the monitor will not be powered either.
If the green light is on but the monitor screen is blank:
* Make sure that the contrast or brightness has not been turned down (the contrast and
brightmess controls are to the left of the power switch).
If the green light is on but the monitor screen shows nothing but white noise, becomes
monochrome or has developed a peculiar colour tint:

* If possible, check whether the cables to the processor are properly connected (the cables plug
into a socket at the opposite corner of the processor to the power switch).

Subsection 12

System failure

If the cables are loose or disconnected:
* Call the Horizon System Helpdesk (see paragraph 19.1; page 76).

Please note: — Do not try to reconnect the power cable in this instance.

If the screen appears to be operating:

* Check whether the touch controls are working.

If the screen appears to be operating but the touch controls are not working:

* Check whether the cables from the touch screen control unit at the back of the monitor have
not been unplugged or pulled loose from the system unit.

If the cables are loose or disconnected:
* Call the Horizon System Helpdesk (see paragraph 19.1; page 76).

Please note: —_ Do not try to reconnect the cables in this instance.

If you need to carry out transactions and the monitor is still not working:

+ Comple

the transaction using an alternative workstation, if one is available

*  Ifanother workstation is not available, complete the transaction manually without entering any
information onto the system.

For information on completing the transaction manually, see the appropriate procedure as shown
below:

- for the AP Fallback procedure see Transactions - Serve Customer - Part one; Automated
Payments; Automated Payments during system failure

For all other transactions, refer to the appropriate booklet of the Counters Operations Manual.

If you need to carry out transactions and the touch screen is still not working:
* Continue with the transaction using the keyboard instead of the icons on the touch screen.

Please note: — The icons on the screen perform the same functions as the function keys FI to
F16, along the bottom left of the keyboard. The corresponding keys are shown on
these icons.

Every screen button has a key board equivalent that is shown on the button. Some of these are
underlined which means that they are selected by pressing and holding the alt key and the pressing

the underlined character.

An example of this is ‘deleting from the transaction stack of more than 3 items. UP to 3 items the
TI, T2 & T3 keys can be used. When a larger transaction stack is opened, up to 9 buttons are

using the Alt key.

12.4 Bar-code reader failure
When the bar-code reader has failed:

* Check that the light beam is working correctly.

If the reader is giving out a light:

* Check whether the reader beeps when you scan a bar-code.

Please note: ‘The bar-code reader light can function with only the power connected, but
without a signal connection it will not be able to transmit the bar-code to the
computer. A beep indicates that the bar-code has been read successfully.

If the bar-code reader does not beep:

+ Check the reliability of the scanner by trying to scan several bar-codes.

Please note: In extreme light or dark, when there is interference, or when the scanner window
has become clouded or dirty, the scanner’s reliability may decrease. This means
that the bar-code reader will not always be able to read bar-codes easily.

If the bar-code reader requires a few attempts to read a bar-code:

* Call the Horizon System Helpdesk (see paragraph 19.1; page 76).

If you need to carry out a transaction and the bar-code reader is still not working:
* Enter the bar-code manually by using the keyboard

13 Identifying lost transactions following a system failure

If the Horizon system fails for any reason transaction information may be lost. This could either be
information about a transaction that was in progress at the time of the failure or information about
transactions that were completed and which has become corrupted as a result of the system failure.

As soon as the system is restored you must identify any lost transactions so that they can be
recovered correctly.

The system will prompt you for recovery of lost Automated Payments transactions when it is
restarted. For information on recovery of Automated Payments transactions see Transactions - Serve
Customer - Part one; Automated Payments; Recovery of Automated Payments.

However you will have to identify and recover lost EPOSS and OBCS transactions yourself using the
procedure below.
Daily Transactions

For example: Girobank, BT bills, National Savings, manual summaries used for despatch of
documents.

+ Produce a summary, and if dockets already despatched, cut off their Horizon reports
+ Compare the manually summarised dockets with the automated summary

+ Enter any manual summarised dockets despatched on to the Horizon system and produce
automated summaries, and then cut off as per normal procedures

* Enter any transactions not entered, identified by available dockets, by bulk input. For
information on bulk input of transactions, see Transactions - Serve Customer - Part three;
System failure & recovery; Entering bulk transactions following system failure

Subsection 15

Equipment information and maintenance

15 Counter equipment

The counter workstation or node provided at your office consists of several pieces of equipment:

- the processor

- the keyboard (including the Magnetic Card reader and the Smart Card reader)
- the monitor (including the touch screen)

- the bar-code reader

- the counter receipt printer

You will also receive a larger printer for printing additional reports such as Cash Accounts and
client summaries, which will be either:

- the inkjet printer
- the laser printer

The workstation that is the connection between your office and the central system is known as the
Gateway Workstation. During initialisation this will be identified by the words ’Gateway
Workstation’ in the top left hand corner of the screen. After installation the monitor should be
labelled (this is normally done by the engineer) so that the Gateway Workstation can always be
located easily.

The following sections describe each piece of equipment and tell you what the equipment does.

15.1 The processor

The processor is the ‘brain’ of the system. It receives information from other parts of the Horizon

system, processes it as necessary and sends information out again. For example, when you want to

print a receipt, you send the request to the processor by touching an icon on your screen or by

pressing a key on your keyboard. The processor then instructs the counter receipt printer to print

the receipt.

The processor has:

- an on/off switch

- a power-on indicator (when the power-on indicator is green, you know that the processor is
switched on)

- two other lights, below the power-on indicator (when information is being processed these
lights will sometimes flash on and off)

Please note: Never switch the processor off unless you are moving a trolley.

* Please ensure that the air vents on the sides of the processor are kept clear at all times, to
prevent the processor from overheating,

15.2. The keyboard
You can use the keyboard, like the touch screen, to communicate with the processor.
It also incorporates four main groups of keys:

- the alpha keys (the top four rows of keys); the keys are arranged similar to the typewriter

keyboard layout, but you cannot type numbers her
Please note: The backspace key may be used to delete incorrectly entered information.

- the numeric keypad (the middle block of keys on the lower part of the keyboard); you can use
this to type numbers as an alternative to the numeric and alphanumeric keypad displays on the
screen. The keypad also includes three extra keys:

= PLU, which displays the PLU sale input screen
-  RECPT, which prints a receipt
- ENTER, which can be used to enter data or settle transactions

- the function keys (the left hand block of keys on the lower part of the keyboard); these keys are

programmed so that when you press them, a specific Horizon system function is carried out

Please note: _ It is important to remember that the function keys can be used as an alternative to
some of the touch screen icons.
The corresponding function key is shown in the bottom right hand corner of the
touch screen icon.

~ the navigation keys (the right hand block of keys on the lower part of the keyboard); you can
use these keys to move around the system as an alternative to the touch screen icons
The navigation keypad also includes the following extra keys:
- PREY, which returns you to the previous screen or menu
- DEL, which can remove a transaction from the stack
- HOME, which can return you to either the Desktop or to the Serve Customer
screen
- PAGE UP, which takes you to the next page up in stacks and pick lists
- PAGE DOWN, which takes you to the next page down in stacks and pick lists
- HELP, which will show you any help text
- UNDO, which has the same function as the X icon on the screen
- 13, which you use to select a transaction third from the bottom of the stack
- 12, which you use to select a transaction second from the bottom of the stack
- TI, which you use to select a transaction at the bottom of the stack
- END, which enables you to navigate to the end of the stack
- arrow keys, which you can use to scroll up and down a picklist

Please note: = The MORE key on the keypad does not have any function on the Horizon system at
this time.

The keyboard contains the Magnetic Card reader and the Smart Card reader.

Subsection 15

Equipment information and maintenance

15.3 The Magnetic Card reader

When you swipe a Magnetic Card through the reader, the information in the magnetic strip is
passed to the processor. You can use Magnetic Cards to process various customer transactions.

‘To swipe a Magnetic Card:
* Pick up the card
* Make sure that the magnetic strip is facing you and that it is on the bottom of the card

* Place the card in either the left hand or the right hand side of the reader slot, ensuring that it is
resting firmly on the bottom of the slot

* Swipe the card through the slot, either left to right or right to left.
The reader has three status indicator lights, as follows:

-  agreen light means that the reader has read a card successfully

- an orange light means that the reader is reading a card

~ aed light means that the card swipe has been unsuccessful (if a valid Magnetic Card was
swiped correctly)

15.4 The Smart Card reader

When you insert a Smart Card into the slot of the reader, information is passed to and from the
processor. A Smart Card called the Postmaster Memory Card (PMMC) is used as part of the start-up
process to allow access to the data held by the Horizon system. Smart Cards can also be used for
making Automated Payments.

The gold contact pad must be facing the front of the keyboard. The reader light will turn to orange
to indicate the card is being read. If the light turns red, there is a fault on either the reader or the
card.

15.5 The monitor

The monitor displays information relating to the current activity. There are two types of monitor:
Micro Touch and Flat Panel Display.

Ichas (in order from the right hand side):

- a power-on indicator
- an on/off switch
- dials (that enable you to control the contrast and brightness of the screen display)

Please note: — The remaining four dials (for width and horizontal control) are blanked off to
prevent adjustment.

The monitor has a touch-sensitive screen, which means that you can send information to the
processor by touching specific parts of the screen with your finger. Some of the functions that you
perform on the touch screen can also be performed using the keyboard

Please note: You must not touch the screen with other objects, such as pens or pencils. You
may damage the screen if you touch it with anything other than your finger.

+ Please ensure that the monitor is switched on at the beginning of the day and switched off at
the end of the day.

sful, the bar-code reader will beep.

* Release the trigger.

If the bar-code is not read successfully on your first attempt:

+ Scan the bar-code again, varying the distance and angle at which you are holding the reader.
If after three attempts the bar-code has still not been read:

+ Enter the details manually, according to the relevant procedure.

If there is a continual problem with failure to read bar-codes:

* Please report this to the Horizon System Helpdesk.

15.7 The counter receipt printer

You can use the counter receipt printer to issue receipts for your customers and to produce some
reports. The printer holds a roll of paper which is used for printing the receipts and reports. It also
has a slot at the front into which you feed various client summaries. The receipt printer has:

- an on/off switch, located at the back of the printer
- a ‘Ready’ light, which shows green and shines steadily when the printer is operating correctly

Please note: _If the ‘Ready’ light starts flashing, there is a problem with the printer. The

Using the Memo View facility

Memo View is used to broadcast urgent messages to outlets electronically, allowing staff to view
and print them at their convenience. Memos are relayed to all users but it remains the
responsibility of the outlet manager to ensure that the relevant users are aware of the memos and
that they are acted upon.

Memos can only be printed on the Counter Printer.

The system warns the appropriate users that there is a new memo waiting by displaying a flashing
envelope symbol in the stack area under the calendar. If you have an unread memo waiting when
you log on, or you receive a new memo, the envelope flashes for ten seconds, after which it will

remain in a steady state until the memo has been read.

You cannot delete memos. The system will delete them when their retention period expires.
retention period will be set by the sender and will be between 10 and 37 days.

2) read memos (high then low priority),

in descending date and time in all categories.

A red spot indicates that the memo has a high
priority and should be read immediately. Other
memos should be read as soon as possible. A tick
indicates that the memo has been read.

I Main functions of the system and how to move around it

The purpose of this section is to tell you:

- what the main functions of the system are
- how you choose which one to use

- how you move around the system

- the on-screen icons and their functions

- how to get on-screen help if you have a problem when you are using the system

1.1 The screen

The monitor screen is ‘touch sensitive’. Touching the screen icons enables you to activate the
functions.

An icon is a small picture that represents a task or a group of tasks. It can also contain descriptive
text.

A keyboard alternative exists for each icon. The keyboard key, which you may use instead of
touching the screen, is indicated in either the top right hand corner or the bottom right hand
corner of the icon.

All screen displays in the menus consist of three areas:

- the main body of the screen which displays the icons for the main tasks, allowing you to
progress through the various menus and to select products or reports

- a row of icons at the top that enable you to go back through the menus, call up on-screen help,

remove transactions from the stack and suspend a transaction
Please note: — The suspend transaction icon is at the top of the transaction stack.

- the right hand side of the screen, known as the transaction stack, which generally provides a
summary of any transactions that are awaiting settlement or completion. When you are not
working on transactions, the date, time and your user details are shown here.

1.2. The screen menus

To gain access to a menu on the screen you can use either of the following methods:

- touch the appropriate icon on the
- use the keyboard alternative

reen

For the Menu area, the keyboard equivalent to the icons are the function keys, which are at the
bottom left of the keyboard.

Once you have logged on to the Horizon system, the Desktop screen is displayed. It is called the
Desktop screen because it allows access to all the main tasks that you might want to carry out
during the working day. Access to each main group of tasks is provided by icons on the Desktop
screen.

When you touch the Transactions icon on the Desktop screen, you are presented with another

menu screen. This new menu screen displays icons which indicate the transaction options available
to you.

Subsection I

System overview

The menu area can have up to sixteen icons, arranged in four rows of four icons, which lead you to
products, applications, and lower level menus.

1.3. Input screens

An input screen is a screen that enables you to enter data on the Horizon system, for example, the
price of an item or your password.

You can enter data using the keyboard or the on-screen alphanumeric keypad.
To move between the different sections of an input screen:

* Use the navigation keys on the keyboard or the on-screen icons,

To accept the information on the screen:

* Select the Y icon on the screen or press Enter on the keyboard.

To reject or delete the information on the input screen:

* Touch the X icon.

If you want to change information:

* Touch the X icon or backspace icon (which appears as a left pointing arrow on the screen) to
delete the information and enter the new data, or use the backspace key on the keyboard.

Please note: __If you need to enter your password for security reasons, the password is not
displayed on the screen as you enter it. The password is shown as a series of ‘X”
characters.

1.4. The numeric keypad
When numeric data is required, the Horizon system displays a numeric keypad on the screen.
‘To enter numeric data:
* Press the numbers on the screen, or use the numeric keys in the bottom-centre of the keyboard.
When a date is required the system displays the required number of forward slashes:

+ Enter it as day/month/year (DD/MM/YY).

1.5 The alphanumeric keypad

When you touch the alphanumeric keypad icon, the keypad expands to produce an on-screen

keyboard.
‘To enter data which can be a mixture of letters and numbers:
* Use the appropriate keys on the keypad

+ Touch the Backspace icon (which appears as a left-pointing arrow) on the screen to delete the
information one character at a time (alternatively you can use the Backspace key on the

keyboard).

1.6 Icons
Each icon (picture) on the screen has a similar structure. At the bottom of the icon there is a text
line which describes the use of the icon. The icon also contains a picture to help you to identify the
task it represents. The keyboard equivalent is also shown on the icon. Transactions are carried
out in the same way when you use the keyboard as when you touch the screen icons
If an icon contains three dots in the top left hand corner it means that there is a menu or a pick list
underneath it.
The Finish icon, which appears at the bottom of the transaction stack, is colour coded to help you.
When money is to be taken from the customer the value is displayed in white lettering and the
icon is labelled with the word ‘Take’. When money needs to be paid out to the customer the icon
is displayed with a minus prefix, is coloured yellow and is labelled with the word ‘Pay’.
Some icons are not available to all users. If you are not allowed access to a transaction, a padlock is
displayed on the icon. If at a particular point a function is not available, the icon will have a’no
entry’ sign.
If you touch the icon for a product that is no longer on sale in the outlet, the system displays a
message telling you that the product is not available.

1.7 Functions of the screen icons
The top section of the screen displays a number of icons that each have a particular function
relating to the system, as follows:
The Desktop icon
‘The Desktop icon is displayed in the top left hand corner of the screen. It bears either the word
Desktop or words indicating the mode that you are in (for example Serve Customer, Reversal,
Housekeeping etc). The words indicate the menu you will return to if you touch the icon.
You can press the Home key on the keyboard instead of touching the icon to produce the same
effect.
The Prev icon

Training mode

Subsection I

Training mode

Il Training mode guidelines

Any transaction that can be carried out in live mode at the counter can also be performed in
training mode.

Transactions are processed in exactly the same way in either mode, however training mode differs
in three respects:

- the background on the screen isa light purple colour instead of the blue-green wash of the live
system

- the background of the screen has the word "Training’ across it

- the printer will print ‘training mode’ on every receipt and report

Only the person who is logged onto the system with Manager Level of responsibility will be able to
gain access to training mode.

‘To support training mode managers will have been given the following items during the training

course:

= a training pack of 6 magnetic cards and one smart card for the Automated Payment Service

- practice bar-codes for the Automated Payment Service, Logistics Feeder Service and Order Book
Control Service

= password(s) and username(s), allowing access to training mode

The training database resets to its original state every day so that the data can be reused. This occurs
overnight during the Desktop reload. If the system is in use at the time and the reload does not take
place, the data will not be reset. If the data has not reset, the user will have the option to reset it the
next time training mode is accessed.

It takes approximately 8 minutes to access training mode and 2 minutes to log out before you can
log on to the live Horizon System therefore you should plan your use of training mode carefully.
To maintain a high level of customer service you should operate training mode outside of opening
hours whenever possible, or alternatively on an unoccupied workstation.

Please note: Do not try to leave training mode by switching off the processor, as you will then
need to follow the restart procedure which will impact on customer service.

Use this procedure when you need to restart a workstation, or to initialise a replacement non-
Gateway workstation that has just been installed in your office.

This procedure applies to both the existing Gateway workstation and non-Gateway workstations. It
does not apply to a replacement Gateway workstation. For information about restarting a
replacement Gateway workstation see subsection 15; Replacement of a Gateway workstation.

In all cases, you will not be able to use the workstation until this procedure has been completed.

If a power failure has taken all workstations down, access must first be regained on the Gateway
workstation. If the Gateway workstation cannot be restarted, access can be regained on the non-
Gateway workstations, provided that the PIN record and PMMC are available. However, there will
be no external communication with the centre.

Store the new PIN record in a signed sealed envelope
in a secure location, separate from the PMMC.

Please remember: It is very important that you keep
the PMMC and PIN record secure
but separate. If either is lost, the
recovery procedure is very time
consuming.

17 Lost Postmaster Memory Card (PMMC)/
Personal Identification Number (PIN)

Use this procedure when you need to restart a workstation but either the PMMC or the PIN record
has been lost. You must perform this procedure in your office on the Gateway workstation. This
can be identified by the label affixed to it. Other Horizon system workstations in your office can be
used whilst this procedure is being undertaken but no data will be transferred until the Gateway
workstation has been restarted.

Because the Gateway workstation must be restarted to display the initial screen, any user working
on it will have to log off. If doing this means that you would have insufficient staff to serve
customers you may postpone the procedure until a suitable time.

completed them at the time the system failed.

Trai
transaction stack, therefore they will have been partly recorded on the system. In this case the

sactions will have been allocated an AP trans:

ction number and will have appeared in the

system will be aware that there is incomplete information about a transaction and will prompt you
to provide the missing information as soon as it is switched on following the failure.

When you have completed session recovery you will be prompted to carry out disaster recovery.

Disaster recovery

You will need to perform disaster recovery if you have completed transactions on the system and,
as a result of a system failure, the system record of the transactions have been lost. You will be

prompted for disaster recovery every time the Horizon system is reloaded, for example when it is
restarted after a system failure. However, if the s

ystem detects that session recovery is required, i.e.

an AP session was in progress at the time of the system failure, then the system will display the
session recovery screen first.

The Horizon system is generally reloaded, as a matter of course, once a day. This reload takes place
overnight to take account of the possible delivery of reference data. This means that, provided this
reload has taken place, the disaster recovery prompt will be invoked at the first logon, for every
workstation in your office, every day.

Although the Horizon system will automatically prompt for disaster recovery you will only need to
check your receipts and complete the disaster recovery process if there has been a physical failure
with an Horizon system workstation, i.e. an internal component within the processor has broken
and an engineer has attended and replaced the broken part.

When you are prompted for disaster recovery you will have to decide whether a component has
been replaced. If a component has been replaced you will need to confirm that details of receipts
held in your office are recorded on the system. The system will present you with the first two
digits of a receipt number and the date and time of the last receipt recorded on the system and will
ask you if you have any receipts that have a later date and time than that shown. If this is the case
you will need to enter the missing information.

When you have completed disaster recovery you will be prompted to carry out fallback recovery.

Fallback recovery

You will need to perform fallback recovery if the system has been unavailable, for example because
of a system failure, and you have carried out AP transactions during the period that the system was
unavailable.

In this case you will enter information from the manual receipts you completed for these
transactions,

These procedures describe recovery as invoked by the Horizon system. To invoke recovery yourself,
for example if you have performed fallback transactions, wish to perform session recovery, or are

instructed by the system to perform disaster recovery, select the AP Recovery option by touching

the Desktop, Transactions and AP Recovery icons in sequence.

9.1 Session recovery

Use this procedure when you need to carry out session recovery to recover Automated Payment
transactions partially recorded on the system when the failure occurred.

When you log on afier a system failure, the Automated Payment (AP) Recovery screen will be
displayed with a message telling you to ‘recover outstanding AP transactions for any system
receipts beginning nn’ (where nn = the node ID number).

For example: If the system displays the number ‘05’, obtain receipts that have a serial number

beginning with ‘05’, e.g. ‘05-00135"

9.2

Disaster Recovery

Use this procedure to determine if the system needs to recover from a failure that resulted in the
loss of important data.

This procedure is normally performed at the first logon, after the desktop menu has loaded.

If it is necessary to perform disaster recovery, then it must be performed and cannot be postponed.
It is not necessary to have completed any outstanding session recovery before performing disaster
recovery, though it is advisable.

The location of the information that needs to be entered is shown on the examples of receipts in
paragraph 5.1; page 37.

The checksum on the receipt provides a check that the data is entered correctly.

If a magnetic card or bar coded bill transaction cannot be recovered because it has an incorrectly
completed or incorrect manual receipt the transaction must be entered using manual fallback

recovery, see paragraph 9.3; page 63. Smart cards cannot be entered on the system in this instance.
To deal with smart card transactions:

* Enter the transaction as an AP Smart receipt (PLU580)

10 Automated Payments ‘Out of Hours’ Transactions

This procedure describes the accounting procedure for Automated Payment transactions performed
outside of the agreed post office opening hours (‘Out of Hours’ transactions).

To simplify the transaction and to assist in balancing and cash account preparation all Out of Hours
transactions must be performed using a separate and easily identifiable stock unit specially created
for this purpose, the Out of Hours (‘OOH’) stock unit. For information on creating a stock unit,
see Office Administration; Stock unit administration; Creating a stock unit.

The procedure for dealing with Out of Hours transactions on the Horizon system will depend on
whether you have permission to use the post office area outside the agreed post office opening
hours.

10.1 Offices with access to the Horizon system outside of the agreed post office
hours

Please remember: Bar-coded bill payment, magnetic card payments and smart card payments
must be recorded on the Horizon System at the time of the transaction.
Transactions accepted on days other than the day of the office balance
* Perform bar-coded bill payment, Magnetic card payment and smart card payment transactions
on the Horizon system as normal, using the OOH stock unit.
Transactions accepted on the day of the office balance

* Balance all stock units except for the OOH stock unit and roll them into the next Cash Account
Period (CAP), as normal, see Balancing booklet.

Once these stock units have been rolled into the next CAP, they will be available for use on the next
working day, even if the Cash Account has not been produced.

Please note: ‘The OOH stock unit must be kept in the current CAP for recording Out of Hours
transactions.

+ Perform bar-coded bill payment, Magnetic card payment and smart card payment transactions
on the Horizon system as normal, using the OOH stock unit.

When all the “Out of Hours’ transactions have been performed on the Horizon system:
* balance the OOH stock unit and roll it into the next CAP as normal.

* proceed with the Cash Account, see Balancing booklet.

10.2 Office with no access to the Horizon system outside of the agreed post office
hours
If you do not have access to the post office secure area outside normal post office hours

* complete Magnetic card payments on an imprinter at the time of the transaction! S¢ ( below

I General information - Order Book Control Service

The Order Book Control Service (OBCS) is the system for checking bar-coded order books (see
illustration below) against a system stop list as a fraud prevention measure.

The stop notice is used to determine whether a payment should be made or restricted in some way.
It also provides a check on the status of order books on receipt in the office and when they are
issued to customers.

Redirection also provides an audit trail for the movement of order books from one office to
another,

OBCS uses the Electronic Point of Sale (EPOSS) for other customer service functions and as the
interface for benefit accounting requirements.

Customer Common Payment Package
Reference Number Number (CPP Number)

Serial Number Bar-code

You scan the bar code on the front cover of an order book:

- when you receive the book in your office
- when you issue the book to the payee
- whe the customer presents the book for payment

The Horizon system then checks the system stop and recall notices and advises you if a payment is
to be made, if it is to be restricted in some way, or if the book is to be impounded.

The possible messages are:

= Encash (pay valid foils as requested by the customer)
= Recall (pay valid foils either up to and including a specific date or one valid foil and impound
the order book)

= Impound (impound the order book without payment)

Please note: — Since some counterfeit order books may pass the Horizon system validation rules
you must perform manual checks of books, in conjunction with the system
checks

to ensure that books are valid. For information about validating order
bookst Se (i) below

1.1 Horizon System Helpdesk - OBCS validation service

An OBCS validation service is provided by the Horizon System Helpdesk. Use this for validating
bar-coded order books during a period of system failure. The Horizon System Helpdesk should be
contacted during an encashment transaction:

= if the Horizon system has failed and is not available for use or
- where a Network failure message is displayed.

and

for local books:

Where the current or previous week’s system stoplist is not available, another cannot be printed
and the total value of the encashment exceeds £200.

for foreign books:

Where more than one foreign book is presented or the total value of encashment exceeds £200.

When contacting the Horizon System Helpdesk you will need to provide the following order book
details:

- Customer reference number
- Order book serial number
- CPP number

If the book is not on the printed stoplist and/ or has been validated by the Horizon System
Helpdesk but you are still suspicious, contact your local BA Sector Fraud Validation line.

Subsection 9

Out of hours transactions

9 ‘Out of hours’ transactions

“Out of hours’ transactions are post office transactions which occur outside of the agreed post
office opening hours, such as before the post office opens, during the lunchtime period (if the
office closes for lunch) or after the post office closes for the day.

A separate stock unit should be created to deal with all ‘out of hours” transactions. For ease of use
and to assist in balancing and cash account preparation, all Lottery transactions should be
performed using the ‘out of hours’ stock unit, including those transactions which occur during
normal post office hours of business.

The stock unit should be created as a single stock unit, unless more than one person needs access
to the stock, where a shared stock unit should be created.

* Create the stock unit following the normal procedure, using the stock ID ‘OOH’ see Office
Administration; Stock unit administration; Creating a stock unit.

The procedure for dealing with transactions on the Horizon system which are performed out of
hours will depend on whether you have obtained permission to use the Horizon system outside
the agreed post office hours.

The procedure below provides information on how to deal with ‘out of hours’ transactions.
However, for specific information on how to deal with National Lottery and Automated Payments

will need to be decreased accordingly:

If this is a Cash shortage the Distribution Centre may
request you return the supporting documentation,
e.g. the banknote envelope and remit out the
appropriate amount as voucher.

you will need to increase your voucher holdings
using the adjust stock facility. This will automatically
decrease your cash.

Uncharged Receipts). This should be carried out on the stock unit in which the discrepancy
occurred directly after balance and rolled over to the next Cash Account Period (CAP).

Ifa stock unit is rolled over to the next balance period any discrepancies must not be posted to the
suspense account until rollover to the next Cash Account Period has taken place.

For example: A £10 loss in CAPO1 BPO1 should not be posted to suspense until CAPO2 BPO1.
You must complete the office Cash Account before redeeming any gains which have resulted.

For further information on dealing with losses and gains and for best practices to be adopted when

Reversing transactions
Subsection 5

Reversing transactions

5 Reversing Electronic Point of Sale transactions

If a transaction has been entered and the customer session completed, you may reverse the
transaction using one of the three methods described below.

Each of the methods produces compensating transactions on transaction summaries. The effect of
the existing reversal and transfer reversal methods is to bring the value of the relevant transaction to
zero.

Reversals cannot be reversed. Should you need to do this, a new compensating transaction must be
made to counteract the reversal.

If reversal of a product is not permitted a no entry sign will appear on its icon in the reversals

screen.

If a product has been remitted out to the Automated Distribution Centre (ADC) in error, each
product in the remittance session must be reversed indiviually and a new remittance out session
performed for the products to be sent back to the ADC. Partial reversal of the incorrect items is not
permitted in this instance.

For information about reversing Automated Payment Service (APS) transactions, see Transactions -
Serve Customer - Part one; Automated Payments; Reversing an Automated Payment.

Please note: Giro deposit and withdrawal reports suppress reversed transactions and show only
correction transactions performed to correct incorrect transactions. However, if
reversals are carried out to Giro transactions after a report has been produced it
will be necessary to produce a manual summary in some cases. For further
information see Balancing with Horizon Guide; Section 4: Correcting errors on

Horizon and Out Of Hours procedures.

Existing reversals

An existing reversal should be carried out for any EPOSS transaction you need to reverse when the
customer session number is available and the reversal is permitted. The customer session number

may be obtained from the transaction log, see Reports; Administration reports; Producing a
transaction log report.

Please note: _ If reversal of a product is not permitted a no entry sign will appear on its icon in
the reversals screen,

This type of reversal can only be carried out at the stock unit that originally carried out the
transaction and this must be completed within the same Cash Account Period (CAP).

When you enter the customer session number, the Horizon system will display the appropriate
transaction,

A new reversal can not be carried out for transactions that require the entry of additional
information. (for example, Girobank account numbers). In such cases the existing reversal option
must be used

As the transaction log will show both the transaction and the reversal and will record the reversal
on the event log, this is the recommended reversal method.

6 Updating reference data (including uprating and
downrating stock)

6.1 Dealing with warning messages

Use this procedure when you log on and the Horizon system gives you a warning message,
advising you that there will be a change to reference data (for example, a change in the value of
first class stamp books due to a tariff increase by Royal Mail).

This message will be displayed on the screen four days before the change takes effect and is
repeated at every log on undertaken each day including the day of the change. When you confirm
the message, the system will print a report of the products to be revalued.

Any adjustment of stock must be undertaken before the day of the change. Once the change has
taken effect, the revaluation will not reflect any subsequent stock adjustment and will revalue based
on stock levels at the time the revaluation activates.

Touch 7 icon @ Touch the ¥ icon

The Horizon system will print a list of all
forthcoming changes to reference data within the
next four days, listing:

- the name of the transaction
- the date of the change
- _ the new value of the transaction

Please note: The data will be changed from 00.01
hours on the day of the change. All
subsequent transactions will be carried
out using the revised data.

be revalued?,

7 Recording parcel traffic from DPI Schedules

At the end of the Cash Account Week, use the totals of Discrete Parcel Income Schedules (forms
P4320 for Inland parcels, forms P4321 for International parcels) to enter parcel traffic figures onto
the Horizon system.

In order to appear on the correct weekly Cash Account, enter figures for parcel traffic just before
carrying out a stock unit balance. The totals may either be entered on an allocated stock unit or
entered separately by individual users. Data will automatically be added to previous entries for the
Cash Account Period.

Please note: —_ The transaction totals for each parcel type must be entered separately, for example
the total figures for inland stamped parcels (if any) must be entered first, followed
by the total figures for inland metered parcels, and so on.

You will need to repeat the whole procedure for each parcel type.

Failure to enter the total figure for each type of parcel separately will cause errors in your cash
account.

Introduction
Introduction
Introduction

This booklet contains information about reports that are available from the Horizon system and
how to obtain them. For some reports you will be asked to specify criteria on which the report will
be based. For example, you may wish to obtain a report for a particular user or stock unit, or for a
particular day or period of time.

If, when you are printing or viewing reports, you find that you have made a mistake in a
transaction you may need to carry out a reversal. For information about reversals see Transactions -
Serve Customer - Part one; Automated Payments.

Previewing, printing and completing reports

Once the system has processed the data, you will have the option of either previewing, printing or
exiting from the report. If you choose to print, the report will print on the tally roll or back office
printer as applicable. The preview option enables you to display a representation of the anticipated
print out on the screen, with an accurate depiction of the report format, content and

pagination. There are facilities to page through the report (scan up and down)and then to exit from
the print preview screen. When you select the ‘exit’ option, you will exit from the printing
function.

Report cut-off facility

The report cut-off facility allows you to decide a cut-off point for each client summary, once you
have previewed or printed the report. When the cut-off has been selected, any future report for the
same stock unit will not include transactions that took place prior to this cut-off time.

For example: A stock unit performs 3 x Alliance and Leicester Girobank deposit transactions -
£32, £20 and £17. A report is produced which is subsequently checked and
cut off. The report will show the three transactions and a total of £69.
After the report has been cut off the stock unit performs three further Alliance and
Leicester Girobank deposit transactions - £20, £10 and £5. When a report is
produced it will show only the three transactions (£20, £10 and £5) which took
place after the previous cut-off.

Reports for individual users
Stock unit reports can be generated for individual users. These enable each clerk to check and
reconcile their vouchers against individual client summaries for a particular accounting period.

Mandatory reports

Some reports are mandatory and must be produced in order for you to complete your stock unit
balance and roll over the stock to the next accounting period. If there are outstanding mandatory
summaries, the system will not allow you to proceed further until they have been generated. You

can check on the system which reports are outstanding by selecting the ‘Summaries’ option se
Balancing; General stock unit activities; Checking and producing outstanding summaries.
Retention of reports

* Always file reports printed from the Horizon system according to Cash Account week number

* Keep all reports in a secure place in your office.

Reprints of reports

There is a facility on the system to reprint various office reports, for example the Cash Account
report, the redeemed stamps or the Pensions and Allowances summary, There is also a facility to
reprint a number of stock unit reports including the stock unit balance and counter revenue report.

Stock Unit Balance snapshot

This report provides a current summary of transactions and cash and stock levels for a stock unit,
giving the user an idea of what the stock unit balance report would look like were they to produce
one at that particular time. It is useful for checking system-derived totals against actual totals before
a stock unit balance report is obtained

A stock unit balance snapshot may be produced as many times as required and does not have any
dependencies.

Stock Unit Balance report

A Stock unit balance report is a formal record of accounts for a specific stock unit within a

particular Cash Account period. It stands as an official record of weekly cash and stock holding,
client transactions and movement of cash and stock both in and out of the office. All stock units
must be balanced and rolled over into the next CAP before an office can process a Cash Account.

Office snapshot

This report provides a current summary of all transactions, and current cash and stock levels in the
office, giving the user an idea of what the balance report would look like, were they to produce
one at that particular time. It is useful for checking system-derived totals against actual totals before
an office report is obtained.

The office snapshot may be produced as many times as necessary and at any time in the Cash
Account Period, regardless of whether all individual stock units have been balanced.

Cash Account report

The Cash Account report is the final and formal record of office accounts for a particular Cash
Account Period. It stands as an official record of weekly cash and stock holdings, client transactions
carried out and movement of cash and stock in and out of the office. It also includes the same
management information that is recorded on the snapshot. A trial Cash Account report is produced
prior to the production of the two final Cash Account reports.

A Cash Account report may only be produced if:

- all stock units have been balanced and rolled over to the next CAP
- all non-accounting and parcel traffic data has been entered.
- non-value stock has been confirmed

Please note: You must keep one copy of the final Cash Account report in your office for
reference and audit purposes.

Use this procedure when you need to declare the value of the stamps and stock in your shared
stock unit (excluding cash) at the end of a Cash Account Period or when your stock is balanced.

Stock declaration is an optional procedure for a shared stock unit and the user may elect to adjust
stock instead. For information on adjusting stock, see subsection 2; Adjusting stock. However, if a
declaration is made for one portion of stock, all other portions must declare too.

You must make a stamp declaration for each part of a shared stock unit. Allocate an identity
number to each stamp declaration.

For information on declaring stamps for individual stock unit balancing, see subsection 5;
Declaring your stamps.

For information on declaring cash, see subsection 11; Declaring your cash.

16 Producing an office snapshot

The snapshot gives a system derived view of the state of balance of your office, listing transactions
for the current cash account period only.

This procedure is usually carried out after all the stock units are balanced to give you information
about all the stock unit balances added together. However a snapshot can be taken at any time and
it does not require the completion of all stock unit balances.

Only someone in your office with manager or supervisor access level can obtain an office snapshot.

Only stock units that have already been balanced will have any loss or gain displayed by the
Horizon system. However if any stock units have unresolved discrepancies from a previous cash
account period these will still show on the snapshot.

transactions, and current cash and stock levels in the

18 Extending the Cash Account Period (CAP)

This section is only relevant to postmasters whose contract allows them to extend a Cash Account
Period (CAP) by two to three weeks while on holiday.

Please note: Before using this procedure you must apply for permission from the Network
Business Support Centre (NBSC) at least three weeks before your absence, see
Office Administration booklet; Miscellaneous.

‘The procedure to extend the CAP must be carried out during the CAP preceeding the one you want
to extend and before any of the stock units for that CAP have been balanced.

For example: _ If permission has been given to dispense with the production of Cash Accounts for

Introduction

Balancing with Horizon

Welcome to ‘Balancing with Horizon’.

Most of you will know that before rolling out Horizon, we conducted a live trial
to understand the impact of automating offices. This trial identified a number of
problems, including longer balancing times and cash account errors in the first
few weeks after the introduction of Horizon. This manual has been developed to
overcome these problems and to help make the transition to Horizon easier for
you.

During development, we spoke to subpostmasters, retail network managers and
Horizon field support officers about the problems they had experienced when
they started to use the system. As a result, procedures based on their practical
experience were developed to overcome these problems.

When an automated system like Horizon is introduced, it is very important that
everyone carries out procedures in the same way. This manual shows, in an easy
to read way, how procedures must be carried out, am confident, that if you are
unsure how to carry outa procedure, this manual will explain how it is done. I do
not expect you to read it from cover to cover because it is really a ‘how to do’
reference to be used to help you with the daily and weekly procedures that will
change when Horizon is introduced at your office. You must follow these
procedures to ensure that you balance accurately.

I want you to use this guide as your first reference point when you have any
questions about or problems with balancing

Please phone the Network Business Support Centre on 0845 6011022 if you have
any queries about this manual or about any business as usual procedures. For help
with using the Horizon system, remember to ring the Horizon System Helpdesk
on 0845 7762576.

Automation is something new that may worry a lot of people. Your retail network
manager and Horizon field support officer both have copies of the manual and
will help you through the early stages,

Finally, I would like to wish you good luck with using Horizon.

Practical tips when using Horizon

* tis extremely important that procedures are carried out in a consistent manner. This means that there
is one way of doing things and everyone must carry out procedures in the same way. This manual
describes how you must do this.

+ Alltransactions must be entered correctly into the Horizon system at the time of serving the customer,
unless the transaction is completed away from the counter. Always check the transaction on the screen
agrees with the actual transaction completed at the counter. It is much easier to correct an error on the
Horizon system while you have the transaction on the screen and the customer is still in front of you
rather than later when they have left the office.

* You should ensure reports are checked against the appropriate documents and that any errors found
are amended accordingly. These must only be ‘cut-off” when you are happy they are correct. You may
have to complete daily report procedures twice as no daily transactions can be held on the Horizon
system on balance day.

* The reports that are produced from the Horizon System are only as good as the information that is
entered into it. Therefore, you must check them carefully against the actual transaction documents to
ensure that all account numbers and amounts are correct. If any of the reports are incorrect a reversal
must be performed and another report produced which again must be checked. This must be done as
soon as an error has been identified.

+ For shared stock unit offices — When checking dockets against reports, you should keep the ‘cut-off’
screen visible. This will ensure that any transactions being carried out simultaneously at other
positions will not be added to the existing report you are checking. When you have finished checking
the report and have selected ‘cut-off’, any transactions that were carried out during this time will be
automatically added to the system and will be available for checking on the next report.

* When balancing Stock units, check that the Horizon System figures for stamps, stock and cash agrees
with the actual stamps, stock and cash on hand by making the necessary adjustments. When you are
happy that the stamps, stock and cash are correct, you must then roll over the stock unit into the next
Cash Account Period or Balance Period. All normal physical checks still apply when balancing your
stock unit.

* Adjustment of stock is the recommended method to ensure that system totals and actual stock
holdings agree. However an alternative method to stock adjustment is to make a stock declaration.

This means declaring your stock holdings rather than adjusting the system held totals. If you have used
the method of stock declaration and you subsequently need to make an amendment to the stock you
must re-declare the stock on the system.

* Once the office has been rolled over into the next Cash Account Period two Cash Account Final
Reports will be produced. One must be sent to Chesterfield, the other must be held at the office for 6
years. Ensure both copies are signed and datestamped. The cash account must not be altered in any
way as the changes will have no effect on the electronic version that is sent to Chesterfield.

Retention periods for supporting documents

* The retention period of supporting documents has been standardised. All Horizon reports and manual
forms that are required to be retained in the office must be kept for two years, with the exception of
the Cash Account report, which must be retained for six years.

Remittances and Transfers (optional)

Please remember:

1

i)

You must check your vouchers / dockets against the Horizon produced report and manual summaries
to ensure the totals of values and volumes agree.

If you have other transaction dockets which are produced on a daily basis and for which there is no
Horizon system report, you should check them against the balance snapshot, but please note these
figures are cumulative during the Cash Account Period (CAP). If an error is found, refer to the
corrections section in this guide.

The balance snapshot will also enable you to check your cash and stock holdings on a daily basis if
required. If an error is found, refer to the corrections section in this guide.

. For shared stock unit offices — When checking dockets against reports, you should keep the ‘cut-off’

screen visible. This will ensure that any transactions being carried out simultaneously at other
positions will not be added to the existing report you are checking. When you have finished checking
the report and have selected ‘cut-off’, any transactions that were carried out during this time will be
automatically added to the system and will be available for checking on the next report.

Office summaries - Any office summaries undertaken prior to the production of the previous week's
cash account will not reflect the transactions performed in the current CAP. For example if stock units
have rolled into CAP2 and the cash account for CAPI has not been completed the daily office summary
will not reflect the totals for CAP2 until the cash account for CAP1 is complete.

Transfers

Transfers are the process for receiving and supplying cash and stock between stock units internally within
an office. Transfers are only normally applicable to multi-stock unit offices, as users attached to the same
shared stock unit do not record on the Horizon system transfers between themselves. However, if a single
stock unit office creates additional stock units for correction purposes or for ‘out of hours’ transactions,
they will automatically become a multi-stock unit office, and transfers may need to be recorded (see out
of hours and corrections sections within this guide).

For any stock or cash sent or received from an external source, the Remittance function must be used.

The supplying stock unit must record the ‘transfer out’ on the Horizon system before the receiving stock
unit can record the ‘transfer in’. If the receiving stock unit attempts to record the ‘transfer in’ before the
corresponding ‘transfer out’ has been recorded, it will be prevented by the Horizon system.

A stock unit can not balance and rollover to the next Cash Account Period untill all outstanding transafers
due to the stock unit have been transfered in or reversed by the sender.

Process for transfer out
* From the desktop menu select:

- Transactions (F1)

- Transfers (F2)

- Transfer out (E2)

- Select the stock unit that will receive the transfer and press (F1) to confirm
- Enter the stock / cash that is to be transferred out onto the system

Once all the stock / cash to be transferred out has been entered onto the system, the counter printer will
automatically print a transfer receipt. This must be signed by the recipient and retained by the supplying
stock unit until the end of the week. The recipient and the supplier of the transfer must check that the
amount of stock/cash agrees with the amount shown on the slip and that any discrepancies should be
rectified by a reversal and a re-entry of the transfer. The transfer receipt is then retained in the office for 2
years for audit purposes.

Process for transfer in
* From the desktop menu select:
- Transactions (F1)
- Transfers (F2)
- Transfer in (F1)
- Select the appropriate transfer (F1)
- Check the details on the screen are correct

- Print (F4)
- Accept the transfer and complete (F16)

The system will display a list of any outstanding transfers which are appropriate to that stock unit. It will
also inform the user which stock unit the transfer has come from and the total value of the transfer
outstanding,

Remittances

This facility is used by all offices when they receive/return stock, cash and cheques from/to, an external
source.

When you carry out stock remittance transactions it is vital to ensure that the correct source/destination
is selected on the Horizon system (failure to do so will lead to cash account errors). Listed below are the

remittance sources and destinations together with general guidelines as to when each one would be used.

Remittance sources

instructions on how to deal with remittances from the ADC (see Transactions - Other - Part one booklet;

can be found at National Lottery Instants Received from clients, page 36.
Remittance destinations

‘Out Automated Distribution Centre (ADC)’: Used for when stock is remitted to Hemel Hempstead and
cash and POCL cheques are returned to the Distribution Centre. For instructions on how to deal with

remittances sent to the ADC (see Transactions ~ Other - Part one booklet; Transfers & remittances; Dealing

with remittances to the Automated Distribution Centre)

‘Out Client’: Used for when National Lottery instants are returned to the client. Instructions on how to
deal with Lottery instants can be found at National Lottery Instants Returned to Client, page 37

* Suspense account report

+ Transfers / unreconciled transfers - Multiple Stock Unit Office (Optional)

Please remember:

1. You must check the vouchers / dockets against the Horizon produced report and manual summaries
to ensure the totals in value and volume totals agree.

Ne

. If you have other transaction dockets for which there is no Horizon system report, check against the
balance snapshot or miscellaneous transaction report, but remember these figures are cumulative
during the CAP If an error is found, refer to the corrections section in this guide

3. If you have high volumes of transactions, the following reports can be produced on an ad hoc basis
throughout the week. It is important that you select ‘cut-off’ after printing any of these reports
otherwise the information in the report will be duplicated on any future report.

- Green giro Report

- P&A Report

- PO Paid Report (P490)

- DVLA V10/ V11 Reports (V594 & V595)

4. For shared-stock unit offices ~ When checking dockets against reports, you should keep the ‘cut-off”
screen visible. This will ensure that any transactions being carried out simultaneously at other
positions will not be added to the existing report you are checking, When you have finished checking
the report and have selected ‘cut-off’, any transactions that were carried out during this time will be
automatically added to the system and will be available for checking on the next report.

Section 3: Balancing and Suspense Account

Balance Day

On Balance Day you can prepare for balancing throughout the day in order to save time later. This should
only be done at quiet times and should not impact on customer service. The following list of activities
take you through a recommended series of steps which you can use as a checklist prior to and during
balancing.

Close of Business

Remember to switch on the A¢4 Printer and ensure that the printer has an adequate supply of paper
(approx. 25 sheets).

1&2. Complete Counter Daily Reports and Counter Weekly Reports

* The Daily Reports include the Daily Cash Declaration, in addition to the Declare Cash which is part of
the stock unit balance process

* All daily transactions, accepted after the authorised cut-off time, must be summarised and additional
reports completed before you balance with the Horizon system. They cannot be held in the Suspense
Account. This means that you may need to complete two daily despatches on balance day for some
transactions i.e. One when the postman comes at your cut-off time during the day and another at the
close of business before you balance, although these may not leave the office until the following day.
Even though the second despatch may not leave the office until the following day the summaries/
BCVs must have the balancing day’s date and week number entered on them or errors will be
generated.

3. Post figures to the Suspense Account (unclaimed payments and uncharged receipts) as
necessary and print report

* For details of posting and removing items to and from the Suspense Account, see the Suspense
Account section within this document

+ You must print the Suspense Account report before producing the Cash Account. In multi-stock
offices, only one stock unit will need to produce this report

* The only exception to this is when nothing is being held in the Suspense Account

4, Record non-accounting data (table 10g) and parcel traffic (table 12)
* From the desktop menu select:

- Transactions (F1)
- Non Accounting Data (F14) / Parcel Traffic (F15)

* This activity will need to be undertaken prior to the stock being rolled over into the next cash account

period

In multi-stock offices, non-accounting data and parcel traffic can either be entered individually by users
or the total for the whole office can be entered onto one stock unit. To prevent errors, i.e. duplication of
entries, it is recommended that one person/stock be assigned to enter the figures for the whole office.

POL00090227

horizon

5. Produce Stock Unit Balance Snapshot and carefully check figures
* From the desktop menu select:

- Stock Balancing (F4)
- Bal Snapshot (F5)
- Print (F4)

* Check the Balance Snapshot carefully, ensuring that the system held stock figures match your actual
stock holdings. Use the adjust stock facility to rectify any discrepancies, see step 8. Adjust Stock on
page 66

* Reconcile all receipt and payment transaction totals for which no report is available with the
supporting vouchers / documentation

* Discrepancies with receipt and payment transactions should be rectified before proceeding further by
entering missing transactions or by reversing transactions entered incorrectly (i.e. overstated or
duplicated transactions)

6. Declare Non-value stock

* From the desktop menu select:

- Stock Balancing (F4)
- Declare Non-value stock (F11)
Print (F4)

* Enter on the system the total holdings of non-value stock items (note that non-value stock declarations
are carried forward from the previous CAP allowing them to be edited if required).

* Offices with shared stock units will need to undertake more than one declaration if more than one
user has non-value stock to declare. In such cases, ensure that separate declaration ID numbers are
used for each for each portion of non-value stock.

7. Declare Stamps

* From the desktop menu select:

- Stock Balancing (F4)
= Declare Stamps (F2)
- Print (F4)

+ Enter on the system the totals of cach denomination of stamp (excluding Ist and 2nd class) held in
your stock

* Offices with shared stock units may be required to undertake more than one declaration if more than
one user has stamps to declare. In such cases, ensure that separate declaration ID numbers are used for
each portion of stock

8. Adjust Stock
* From the desktop menu select:

- Stock Balancing (F4)
= Adjust Stock (F4)

* Check actual stock on hand agrees with balance snapshot
* Any discrepancies should be re-checked before making an adjustment

* Check that the totals shown on the ‘postage stamp’ figure on the Balance Snapshot matches the total of
stamps you have declared

+ Any discrepancies should be re-checked before making an adjustment

Page 66 horizon
POL00090227

POL00090227

horizon

+ If you adjust your stamp figure after a stamp declaration you will need to check your original
declaration and confirm it is correct, i.e. select the confirm option

Please note:

Adjustment of stock is the recommended method of ensuring that system totals and actual stock holdings
agree. However, an alternative method to stock adjustment is to make a stock declaration. This entails
declaring your stock holdings as opposed to adjusting the system held totals. If you have used the method
of stock declaration and you subsequently need to make an amendment to the stock you must re-declare
the stock on the system.

9. Declare Cash

* From the desktop menu select:

= Stock Balancing (F4)
= Declare Cash (F1)
= Print (F4)

* Enter your total cash holdings by denomination. Offices with shared stock units may be required to
undertake more than one declaration (i.e. where more than one user has cash to declare). In such
cases, ensure that separate declaration ID numbers are used for each portion of cash

10. View Discrepancies

* From the desktop menu select:

= Stock Balancing (4)
= Discrepancies (F8)

+ The system may display a list of cash and stock discrepancies

11. Ensure Shared Stock Users are Logged Off

* Before producing a Trial Balance Report, ensure that only one user is logged on to the stock unit (i.e.
the user who is producing the trial balance report)

12. Produce Trial Balance Report

* From the desktop menu select:

- Stock Balancing (F4)
- Balance Report (£6)
- Print (F4)

* Once the trial balance has been produced, check that all totals are correct.

* If totals are correct proceed to rollover (step 13. Roll Stock Units over into the next Cash Account
Period or Balance Period on page 67)

+ If there are still discrepancies, touch the exit (F16) icon (do not rollover) and adjust stock/redeclare
or enter missing receipts/ payments transactions or reverse incorrect transactions as required.

+ Once you have investigated the discrepancies and/or made re-declarations you will need to repeat the
Produce balance report process

13. Roll Stock Units over into the next Cash Account Period or Balance Period

* After the balance report has been produced and you are satisfied that all totals are correct, select:

- Rollover (F12)
- Select CAP or BP (Balance Period)

© horizon Page 67
POL00090227
POL00090227

horizon

By selecting the rollover option the stock unit final balance will automatically be produced

* Ifyour office performs out of hours transactions, for example if you are an on-line lottery office,
you should see the Out Of Hours (OOH) procedures in Section 4

* You will also need to ensure that inactive stock units (i.e. stock units where no transactions have
taken place during that Cash Account week) are also rolled over. To rollover an inactive stock unit
use the following icon sequence:

* From the desktop menu select:

- Office Balancing (F8)
-  Inact SU roll (F9)

Please note:

This activity can only be performed by users with manager level access

There are many reasons why an inactive stock unit fails to roll over. For more information see Horizon

15. Print all mandatory Office Weekly Reports — see Section 2

16. Complete all other outstanding manual Summaries; i.e summaries that are required
but are not produced by the system

17. Confirm Non-value Stock Declaration
* From the desktop menu select:

- Office Balancing (F8)
= Confirm Non-Val (F2)

* Confirmation of non-value stock needs only to be undertaken by one user as performing the activity
confirms the non-value stock totals for the whole office. The user undertaking this must have manager
level access.

* A printed report of the non-value stock holdings should be produced and the figures checked against
the actual stock holdings. Any discrepancies should be rectified by editing the appropriate incorrect
declaration after completion of the Cash Account.

* For SAP ADS to receive the amended figures any alterations to a non-value stock declaration must take
place on the same day as the Cash Account

Suspense Account

Overview

Suspense Account is the section of the Cash Account previously known as Unclaimed Payments (Table 2),
Authorised Cash Shortages (Table 2A) and Uncharged Receipts (Table 3) (see below). This section
clarifies the reasons for using the Suspense Account and how to move items into and redeem items from.
Suspense. All of the icons which move products to, and redeem from the Suspense Account, can be found
by the following selection process.

* From the desktop menu select:

- Transactions (F1)
- House Keeping (F13)
- The relevant icon

Please remember: The products work ‘as matching pairs

~ whichever product you select to move an
item to the Suspense Ac
from the same place.

count has a partner which you must use to redeem that item

For example: Within ‘Losses tbl 2A” one of the products available is ‘Loss A to Table 2A’. Its partner
within the ‘Loss rdmd’ option is ‘Loss A redeemed’.

If you do not use the icons in pairs it will create errors in your Cash Account.

For example: Potential errors following an incorrect Suspense Account transaction could result in
negative stock or inflated values.

Therefore extreme care should be taken when moving and redeeming items which have more than one
line on the Cash Account (i.e. Losses, Gains and RD Cheques).

Only the following items can be held in the Suspense Account:
Uncharged Receipts
* Gains
*
* Rem shortages

+ Migration?

+ Pre-purchas

see Horizon System User Guide; Transactions - Other - Part one; Transfers & remittances; Dealing
with a remittance discrepancy.

The Migration option can be used by the Horizon Field Support Officer (HESO) at the time Horizon is
installed in your office, where products are not currently available on your system. If it is used, the HFSO.
will explain how to deal with any items contained within this section of the Suspense Account and will leave
a manual form (TP1).

The item(s) will need to be removed from the Suspense Account when the missing product becomes
available. Failure to remove these items from the Suspense Account could result in inaccurate calculation of
remuneration, and settlements not being made to clients.

balanced and rolled into the next CAP. The items must then be removed from the Suspense Account the
following day. For further information, see Horizon System User Guide; Transactions - Other - Part tw

If you have any other products which you think should be moved to the Suspense Account, and you need
authorisation, you must contact the NBSC (0845 6011022) for the correct advice.

Dealing with losses — offices authorised to hold losses

Please note: —_This section is intended for branch offices and other offices that have received authority
from their Retail Network Manager to hold a loss. All other offices must refer to the

procedure described in Section 3: Dealing with losses ~ other offices

Any losses incurred within stock units that are not being ‘made good’ should be moved to the Suspense
Account (Unclaimed Payments) after the production of the final balance and CAP (not BP) rollover. This
must be done using the stock unit in which the loss occurred.

It is important that these instructions are followed carefully as offices that previously operated ECCO
would not have needed to post a loss to the Suspense Account prior to Horizon being implemented.
Failure to post a loss to suspense will mean that the loss will remain with the stock unit

Move any loss incurred to the Suspense Account directly after completing Stock Unit
Balance and CAP Rollover

+ From the desktop menu select:

* Enter the amount of the loss

* Select the Y option

* Select the ‘Finish’ option

* Print a receipt (by pressing the RECPT key) and attach this to the stock unit balance report

Please note: — The following activities are optional but will ensure the stock unit will commence the
new CAP with a net discrepancy of zero. You will need to undertake the declarations
before the stock unit is used for further transactions (i.e. perform the declarations either
that same evening or the following day - before any other activities are performed on the
stock unit)

Complete a cash and stamp declaration using the EXACT figures declared for the stock unit
balance

Please remember: When making cash and stamp declarations you must ensure that the figures are
entered against the appropriate denominations (e.g. declare 1p stamps against Ip, 2p
stamps against 2p etc) as declarations are transmitted to SAP ADS to be used for cash
and stock replenishment purposes.

Account, refer to the procedure described in see Section 3: Dealing with losses — offices
authorised to hold losses.

In other offices, there is a distinction between losses which an office has authority to hold within the
Suspense Account and those which need to be made good.

If a loss is discovered on balancing a stock unit, it should be made good directly after rollover to the next
CAP. If the loss is the result of a known error, for which an error notice will be issued, the amount can be
moved to the Suspense Account and authority to hold the amount sought from the retail network
manager (via the Network Business Support Centre on 0845 601 1022 who will provide you with a call
reference to associate with the loss). In addition to this, if the loss is of such a value that making it good
would result in financial hardship, the amount may be moved to the Suspense Account and permission
sought from your retail network manager, to hold the loss pending a compensating error coming to light.

Making Good Losses

If you have not obtained authority to hold a loss within the Suspense Account, you will need to make
good the discrepancy after the final stock unit has rolled to the next CAP

Make good the loss

* This involves placing the cash for the amount of the loss in your till

Please note: — The following activities are optional but will ensure the stock unit will commence the
new CAP with a net discrepancy of zero. You will need to undertake the declarations
before the stock unit is used for further transactions (i.e. perform the declaration either
that same evening or the following day before any other activities are performed on the
stock unit)

Complete a stamp declaration using the EXACT figures declared for the stock unit balance

Please remember: When making cash and stamp declarations you must ensure that the figures are
entered against the appropriate denominations (e.g. declare Ip stamps against Ip, 2p
stamps against 2p etc) as declarations are transmitted to SAP ADS to be used for cash
and stock replenishment purposes.

To make a stamp declaration
* From the desktop menu select:

Obtaining authority to hold a loss in suspense

If a loss is moved to the Suspense Account, the retail network manager must be contacted (via Network
Buisness Support Centre on 0845 601 1022) the day after the balance has taken place to seek permission
to hold the amount. Your retail network manager will provide you with written authority to hold the
loss, which will also have an end date. If a compensating error has not been revealed by the end of the
authority period, the amount must be removed from the Suspense Account and the loss made good.

If the retail network manager refuses authority to hold the amount, it should be removed from the
Suspense Account and made good before the end of the next balance period.

Dealing with gains — other offices

Please note: This procedure must be used by offices other than branch offices when a gain is incurred
and is adjusted by removing money from the till (after balance). For dealing with gains
in branch offices and gains in other offices which your Retail network manager has
agreed can be held within the Suspense Account, refer to the procedure described in see

Section 3: Dealing with gains ~ offices authorised to hold gains.

Any gains incurred in a stock unit can be dealt with either by moving the gain to the Suspense Account or
removing money from the till.

If a large counter gain is discovered on balancing a stock unit, the amount should be moved to the
Suspense Account directly after rollover to the next CAP. Ifa gain is moved to the Suspense Account, your
retail network manager must be contacted the day after the balance has taken place to seek permission to
hold the amount. Your retail network manager will provide you with written authority to hold the gain,
which will also have an end date. If a compensating error is not revealed at the end of the authority
period, the gain may be withdrawn from post office funds and the amount removed from the Suspense
Account. If an error comes to light after the money has been withdrawn it must be made good with
immediate effect.

Removing money from the till

If you have not obtained authority to hold a gain within the Suspense Account, you will need to correct
the discrepancy after the stock unit has been balanced and rolled over to the next CAP.

Move any gain incurred directly after completing Stock Unit Balance and CAP Rollover

* Remove the cash for the amount of gain from your till

Please note: — The following activities are optional but will ensure the stock unit will commence the
new CAP with a net discrepancy of zero. You will need to undertake the declarations
before the stock unit is used for further transactions (i.e. perform the declarations either
that same evening or the following day before any other activities are performed on the
stock unit)

Complete a stamp declaration usign the exact figures declared for the stock unit balance

Please remember: When making cash and stamp declarations you must ensure that the figures are

If an error is discovered it must be corrected. The report reproduced from the Horizon system should not
be ‘cut-off” until the dockets/supporting information agrees with the report.

This type of error is corrected by using either:

* The reversal facility (where the original transaction has been entered incorrectly)

* By entering a new transaction (where the original transaction has not been entered at all)

* Combination of the two (reversing the original transaction and then entering the transaction
correctly). See Examples I to 3 below.

Please note:

If an Alliance and Leicester Girobank transaction has been reversed before the Alliance and Leicester
Girobank report is produced both the reversal and the original transaction will not be shown on the

Errors found when checking reports after ‘cut-off’

If the ‘cut-off’ button has been selected prior to checking the report against the actual dockets /
supporting information and an error is found, the correction can still be made using the reversal facility.
Once the correction has been made, a further report must be produced from the Horizon sytem with the
“cut-off” facility selected again, this report can then be discarded. The first report must be manually
altered so that the correct entries for volume and value are shown. Any manual alterations must be
initialed (see Example 4 below).

If an Alliance and Leicester Girobank report is found to be incorrect after cut-off

Step 1. Reverse the incorrect transaction(s). For information on reversing transactions see the Horizon
System User Guide; Transactions - Other - Part two; Reversing transactions; Reversing Electronic
Point of Sale transactions.

Step 2. If the transaction was entered for a wrong amount re-enter it correctly

Step 3. Produce and cut-off an Alliance and Leicester Girobank report. This should ideally be done
before any further Girobank transactions are carried out so that the only transactions accounted
for in the report are the reversed transactions and any re-entered transactions that were required.

If the incorrect report has already left your office before any required corrections have been made:

* amend the offi

-opy of the report (the top copy of which has been despatched) to reflect the correct
totals. Associate the report produced in step 3 with the amended office copy
Please note:

Even if the original report sent to Girobank was incorrect making the correction in steps I and 2 will
prevent your office getting an error notice.

If the incorrect report has not left your office:

+ Produce a manual Girobank summary (G6301/G6302)

Please note:
In this instance the manual summary will replace the system produced summary.
* Despatch the manual summary with the associated dockets as described in section 1

* Associate the report produced in step 3 with the manual undercopy.

Dealing with transaction reversals

If a transaction has been entered and the customer session completed, and you subsequently find you
have made an error, you can correct the error by ‘reversing’ the transaction.

Depending on the transaction, you can reverse it in one of four ways:
* as an existing reversal

* anew reversal

* a transfer reversal

* an automated payment reversal.

Existing Reversal

An existing reversal can only be performed on the stock unit that carried out the original transaction, and
only within the same Cash Account Period.

All transactions have a session number — this can be obtained from the transaction log.
* From the desktop menu select: a

reversals — see below.

Redeemed Savings Stamp Reversal

You can only reverse redeemed savings stamps if you also reverse the associated product for which they
were accepted. For example, if you have redeemed BT Savings Stamps to reverse, you must also reverse the

associated BT Bill payment.
To do this you will need the session numbers for the transaction. If you do not know these you will need
to examine the transaction log.

For information on producing the transaction log, see Horizon System User Guide; Report

Administration reports; Producing a transaction log report.

Once you have identified the correct session numbers, proceed as follows:

* Select the existing reversal option

+ Enter the session number of the BT bill payment to be reversed

¢ The BT Bill transaction will appear on the stack

+ Enter the session number of the BT savings stamp payment to be reversed

* The BT savings stamp payment will appear on the stack

* To complete the reversal select the Finish option

* Once the transaction is completed a receipt is automatically printed with the reversal details

* The BT bill payment and correct method of payment must now be entered onto the Horizon system

New Reversal

A new reversal should be carried out only for any EPOSS transaction where the customer session number
is not easily identifiable. For example, when you have identified that an EPOSS transaction has been
entered incorrectly on the system and are unable to identify the specific transaction from the transaction
log.

For information on how to complete a new reversal on the Horizon system, see Horizon System User
Guide; Transactions - Other - Part two; Reversing transactions; Reversing Electronic Point of Sale
transactions.

All transactions which report to the receipt and payments tables of the Cash Account can be corrected
using the new reversal method with the following exceptions:

* Automated payments - see Automated Payment Reversal

* BT bill reversal - see Existing Reversal

+ Alliance and Leicester Girobank Deposits or Withdrawals - see Existing Reversal
+ Remittances in or out - sce Existing Reversal

* Transfers - see Transfer Reversal

‘Transfer Reversal

A transfer reversal can only be carried out on the nnn

stock unit which has transferred the stock out if
the receiving stock unit has not yet transferred in
the stock. This is performed by the use of a
session number, which is obtained from the

transfer receipt. The transfer receipt is printed
automatically when the transfer is completed.

Correcting errors found after stock units have balanced

and rolled over

This section tells you what action to take if you discover an error (prior to the production of the final
Cash Account) in a stock unit that has already been balanced and rolled over into the next CAP

To correct the error you must create another stock unit, called ZZZ, on which you make the
correction. This ensures that the stock unit can be easily distinguished from any other stock unit in
the office.

If you have found errors in more than one stock unit, you can use stock unit ZZZ to rectify all errors.
Create ZZZ as an individual stock unit.

Once created, stock unit ZZZ can be used each week to make any necessary corrections. If it is not used, it
can be rolled over using the inactive stock unit rollover procedure (see Horizon System User Guide;
Balancing; General stock unit activities).

If any errors are found after ZZZ has been rolled over another stock unit should be created in addition to
ZZZ. Additional stock units created should be deleted as soon as you are allowed.

Please remember:
Stock unit ZZZ must not be balanced until you have checked the office balance snapshot and are sure that
no corrections are required.

For information on how to create and attach yourself to a stock unit see Horizon System User Guide;
Office Administration; Stock unit administration.

For information on producing an Office Snapshot Report, see Print Office Snapshot Report on page 68.

See the examples below for details on what action to take when you discover an error has been made in a
stock unit after it has balanced and rolled over.

pir
Example 1 ~ Rod Licence not recorded on the system
Stock unit AA balanced and rolled over to CAP 20 showing a gain discrepancy of £18 in CAP 19.

- Whilst checking the Rod Licence weekly sales summary form P4678 against the office snapshot you
discover that stock unit AA has understated their rod licences by one transaction amounting to £18.

To correct the error create stock unit ZZZ and attach yourself to it
Enter a Rod Licence transaction for £18 and settle for cash
Declare stamps and cash as nil

Complete a balance on stock unit ZZZ — showing a loss discrepancy of £18 - and roll over the
stock unit to CAP 20

_ The loss (£18) in stock unit ZZZ compensates for the gain (£18) in stock unit AA

_* Complete the office cash account and roll over to CAP20
In CAP 20 ‘transfer out’ £18 cash to stock unit AA (do not physically hand over any money)

In CAP 20 attach yourself to SU AA. Complete the ‘transfer in’ of £18 cash (do not physically
hand over any money)

Re-attach yourself to stock unit ZZZ and declare stamps and cash as nil

Complete a trial balance on stock unit ZZZ

Stock unit ZZZ will show a loss discrepancy of £18 and a gain discrepancy of £18, giving a net
discrepancy of zero

When the stock unit balance is completed for stock unit AA it will show a loss discrepancy of
£18 and a gain discrepancy of £18, giving a net discrepancy of zero. (The net discrepancy of
zero is carried forward to CAP 21).

‘Out of Hours’ procedures

‘Out of Hours’ transactions

‘Out of Hours’ refers to post office transactions which occur outside of the agreed post office opening
hours, such as before the post office opens, during the lunchtime period or after the post office closes for
the day.

The procedure for dealing with transactions on the Horizon system which are performed ‘Out of Hours’
will depend on whether you have obtained permission to access the post office area outside the agreed
post office hours. If you are unsure check with your RNM.

A separate stock unit should be created to deal with all ’Out of Hours’ transactions. For ease of use and to
assist in balancing and cash account preparation, Lottery transactions should be performed using the ‘Out
of Hours’ stock unit, including those transactions which occur during normal post office hours of
business. This may or may not include Scratchcards, depending on local practices

* Create the stock unit following the normal procedure, using the stock ID called ‘OOH’ (‘Out of

Hours’) (see Horizon System User Guid

Dealing with lottery transactions accepted on the day of the office balance

Stock unit “OOH” must not be balanced and rolled into the next Cash Account Period, until all Lottery
transactions have been recorded on the Horizon system. This stock unit can be balanced on the morning
after the balance (usually Thursday morning).

* On balance day: Balance all stock units except the ‘OOH’ and any correction stock units. Roll all stock
units except the OOH stock unit into the next Cash Account Period, as normal. (see Horizon System
User Guide; Balancing; General stock unit activities)

Once these stock units have been rolled into the next Cash Account Period, they will be available for use
on the next working day, even if the Cash Account has not been produced.

* The ‘OOH’ stock unit must be kept in the current Cash Account Period (CAP) for the purpose of
recording the out of hours transactions

+ After the Lottery cut-off, follow the procedure for dealing with Lottery transactions at the end of the
day (‘Dealing with transactions accepted on days other than the day of the office balance’)
