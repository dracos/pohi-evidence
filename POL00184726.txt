Rod: could you please share with us all why you are focussing now on a Fujitsu, rather than a Royal Mail/ POL
facility?

Best regards. Ron

Thanks for your quick reply Ron.

I was planning to speak with Simon early next week regarding contacts into Fujitsu. Can I, therefore,
suggest that we do that in first instance. As you suggest a senior referral may be appropriate here.

I have now copied Dave on this email myself. My error maybe in trying to minimise inbox overload. It
may, however, be worth a little chat on one of the next calls about comms protocols just to be clear on
whether the whole audience should get all emails or whether we can streamline to actionees only
where appropriate just to make inboxes manageable. We can obviously brief each other at checkpoints
on all activity.

As for the building, I’ve not googled it myself yet but we do (he said diplomatically) embrace a range of
architectures for all seasons! You could do a history of 17""-21* century architecture across our whole
network and supplier base.

Thanks again for our discussion this morning and look forward to catching up next week and beginning
to get into some spot reviews soon.

Many thanks and hope you have a good weekend
Rod

Thanks Rod. That's the one I found on Google Maps. Bloody ugly building isn't it?

Do you think you or I should seek info directly from Fujitsu as to the who what
when where why and how of that basement office? I laid out the questions in my
earlier emails. Something tells me that a request like that ought to come from
POL's CEO.

Thanks, Ron.

p.s. are you going to and do you want me to routinely copy Dave Posnett on these
sort of emails?

Hello Ron,

Thank you for our call this morning.

Here is the address that I promised to send on:

Fujitsu Services Ltd, Lovelace Road, BRACKNELL, RG12 8SN

As discussed, if this is indeed the location that is presented in the expected affidavit then we are happy
to clarify the scope of operations provided to Post Office there.

Thanks, Rod
