1 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Pathway system architecture is not based on conventional client-
server models. Nor does it conform to traditional central-system models.
It adopts an entirely original and highly innovative four-tier model that
effectively merges the qualities of central systems and client server
systems. It is tailored specifically to meet the demands of the Horizon
system. This four-tier model comprises:

° Counter Clients

. Correspondence Servers

. Agents

* Host Servers.

Each of these architectural layers has been considered both separately
and in combination in assessing the projected loads they will encounter

and in modelling and measuring their potential performance capabilities
against these projected loads.

For New Release 2 the objective of performance modelling and
measurement was to provide assurance that the Pathway system could
support, at least, the peak workload generated during the rollout of the
first 8,000 outlets. For NR2 a ‘safe water marker’ of 40% of full rollout
volumes (equivalent to 8,000 outlets) was selected as the level at which
the system would exceed the demands of the NR2 release after taking
into consideration all appropriate allowances inc.:

. Single site operation

. Heaviest day/hour business volumes

. Operational headroom to allow for e.g. re-runs of failed jobs

° Pessimistic workload profile inc. full multi-benefit (see §3.2)

. Management safety net.

Beyond this ‘safe water mark’ the NR2* release contains a number of

developments that will allow the system to support the full rollout
volumes on a peak on peak day e.g. a double benefit day before Xmas.

ICL Pathway PERFORMANCE SUMMARY REPORT ®ef PAIPER/O16
FOR NR2 Issue: 2.0
Date: 07/06/99

The performance modelling and measurement for NR2 confirms that the
system can support the peak load generated during the rollout of the
first 8,000 outlets including:

° The peak hour and peak day at a 20 counter outlet

. The peak hour at the datacentre during the peak working day.

. The peak daily overnight processing inc. bulk harvesting and
loading of messages into TMS on the Sequent SE70

. The peak day’s interactions with the client systems (file transfer
and on-line)

. The peak day at the data warehouse
. Operational backup at peak volumes
The performance modelling of the system was based on the contracted

volumetrics that include a rollout rate of 300 outlets per week and the
full implementation of multi-benefit by card.

The OBCS service has been measured and modelled against the peak

daily load. The peak load on the OBCS service occurs close to 8,000
outlets as cards replace order books (see diagram).

2000 Outets

The performance measurement of the system also included many tests
that evaluated the behaviour of the system under the peak workload
generated by 20,000 outlets at the end of rollout including:

. Peak daily load on a 20-counter outlet with 100% payment by card
. Correspondence server peak hour

. Peak day BES harvesting/loading of messages

. Peak on peak day overnight processing of PAS/CMS on NUMA-Q

. Peak day file transfer to client systems inc. Automated Payments

where the current volumes are 2.5 times the volumes in the
Workload Brief [BRIEF].

. Peak hour on-line access from client systems.

The results from the measurement and modelling projects have provided
the Pathway design and implementation teams with the business and
message data volumes and mixes that are required in the planning of
the rollout programme to 20,000 outlets. Included in the plans for
releases beyond NR2 are activities to replace or enhance components
of the system e.g. the Host systems, the Correspondence Servers and
the WAN routers to meet the service requirements beyond 8,000 outlets.
These developments are compliant with the capacity management
strategy defined in the Pathway Performance and Scaleability Strategy
[Scaleability].

Pathway has also reviewed the capacity requirements for applications
beyond NR2 and is implementing plans to deliver enhanced versions of
a number of components including:

. the Reference Data loaders,
. Change Nominated Post Office Agents and
. Riposte message server.

The measurement and modelling of the system used the Pathway
workload profile [VOLS] derived from the Business Volumes [BUS
VOLS]. The Pathway workload profile includes models of the peak load
on each of the services. These models can only be verified against the
production system as very little workload data is available to Pathway
from the current manual or ECCO systems. The workload models will be
refined using data collected from the live system during Live Trial and
the early stages of rollout. The data in the models will be refined to more
accurately reflect the production environment so that the workload can
be modelled with increasing accuracy as it grows towards 20,000
outlets. In some areas e.g. AP transactions, this process is already
underway and the volumes used in testing and modelling have been
increased in-line with current operational volumes.

which performance related Acceptance Specifications apply. It further
walks through all other major components of the system. For each it
details (where applicable) the following:

. A brief summary of the current performance status

. The performance assurance requirements specified and agreed,
together with the source reference.

. Status of the performance tests conducted

. Their principal findings

° Report reference

. Any performance modelling carried out

° Its findings

° Source Reference

In most cases the timings are given for single site operation (where
appropriate) as the objective for Pathway is to ensure that even when

one site is out of operation the remaining site can support all of the
workload through to full rollout and can maintain the SLAs.

3.2 BUSINESS MODEL

For NR2, Pathway has undertaken a considerable amount of:
° Testing/measurement and
. Modelling

of the system. To measure or model a system requires a definition of the
workload that is being measured or modelled and in particular a
definition of the peak loads that will be applied to the system during
each period of the rollout. The definition of the business model given in
[BRIEF] does not define the peaks in the workload.

Before Pathway could undertake the modelling and measurement of the
solution, the workload was analysed, modelled and documented in [BUS
VOLS]. This process involved identifying:

. The workload volumes at pre-determined points during rollout e.g.
8,000 outlets

. The peak hour or peak day load at pre-determined points during
rollout

. The workload volumes that would be generated with a modified
rollout schedule e.g. if multi-benefit by card is phased in, the delay
in the introduction of some benefits by card will reduce the BES
workload but increase the OBCS workload during rollout.

Pathway has modelled the workload based on all of the available data.
During the process of modelling the workload, many assumptions had to
be made about the nature of the business. Pathway has been unable to
confirm with the sponsors that the assumptions are valid. A very safe
(low risk) approach has therefore been adopted to modelling the
workload (see below) that will ensure that the NR2 system has the
maximum headroom and can cope with changes to the workload profile.
The peak workload volumes for NR2 are documented in [MOD026}].

The workload model used in the modelling and measurement of the
system has been fixed (see definition below) as any deviation from the
workload model would affect both testing and modelling and make the
evaluation and presentation of results difficult. In particular, the use of a
workload profile that is not changing is essential for developing the data,
scripts and tools used in the testing programme.

FOR NR2 Date 07/06/99

With a constantly changing profile it would be very difficult to assess the
affect of changes to applications, systems or the infrastructure. In almost
every case (with the exception of OBCS) the workload profile which has
been adopted will generate a significantly heavier load on the system
than is now expected. All of the measurements and modelling work is
based on the following rollout model:

National Rollout starts on 5" April 1999 ['].

The rollout rate in the first 6 weeks of rollout is 100, 100, 150, 150,
200 and 250 Post Offices respectively.

The rollout is then 300 Post Offices per week until 22"? November
1999.

Over the 7 week Christmas period the rollout is 150, 150, 150, 0, 0,
0, and 150 Post Offices respectively.

The rollout is then 300 Post Offices per week until all Post Offices
are rolled out.

The rollout model assumes that for benefit payments:

.

.

Multi-benefit by card is in operation across all 20,000 outlets.
Child Benefit by card is available at start of National Rollout.

All other benefits are card enabled within 3 months of the start of
National Rollout.

The number of people collecting each type of benefit is as given in
[VOLS].

During the first 4 weeks after a Post Office is automated no
beneficiary is transferred from payment by book to payment by
card.

All beneficiaries in a Post Office are then transferred from payment
by book to payment by card over the next 20 weeks.

The Automated Payments model assumes that 200M payments are
made per year not the 68M payments defined in the Workload Brief
[BRIEF]

‘Since this decision was made, the dates and the workload have changed. The workload defined
here is pessimistic when compared with the expected rollout. The workload generated before
Christmas '99 will be lighter than the expected workload with 8,000 outlets automated.

3.3 APPROACH TO PERFORMANCE

The requirements on the Pathway solution are very demanding,
particularly during the roll-out programme where the system will grow
from less than 200 outlets to almost 20,000 over less than 24 months.

Pathway therefore must deliver a well-engineered solution that is:

. predictable
° scaleable and
. manageable

A performance engineering approach must be applied to all key
hardware, software, application and network components of the solution.

The approach to performance within Pathway has been structured to
support the requirements of development and delivery. The four key
strands to this are :

. capturing an understanding of the system inc. business volumes
. modelling inc. peak workload volumes

. performance testing

. performance management of the live system

3.3.1. Capturing an understanding of the system

The volume of work executed by the Pathway system will vary
depending on a number of parameters including the time of the day
and the day of the week.

A significant proportion of the workload comes from the payment of
benefits most of which are available to be paid on Monday and
Thursday. This has the effect of skewing the workload over the week
with the number of benefit payments made on a Monday (the day on
which retirement pension and child benefit is due to be paid)
predicted to be approximately 50% more than those made on a
Friday.

There are also seasonal variations to benefit payments, due to public
holidays which typically fall on a Monday, and variations in EPOSS
transaction volumes, such as at Christmas.

The modelling and performance measurement activities require
accurate information about :

° peak workload volumetrics

. the hardware and software configured

. the implementation of services

° the resource usage of each function used by the services
Building a workload profile, and identifying the peaks in the workload,

is key to understanding the load which the Pathway solution must be
able to support.

3.3.2 Modelling

The Pathway resource models use:

° the configuration of the system

° the business load placed upon it

° the messages generated by each of the business functions
° the performance measurements from Performance Testing
as inputs to the modelling work (see diagram).

ICL Pathway PERFORMANCE SUMMARY REPORT ®ef PAIPER/O16
FOR NR2 Issue: 2.0
Date: 07/06/99

The models are initially implemented as engineering models that form
part of the design evaluation process. As measurement data becomes
available the models are refined and the impact of any changes
assessed. Later as volumetrics and performance data becomes
available from the live system, the models will be further refined. This
process will, in the longer term, feed into the performance
management precess.

3.3.3. Performance evaluation

Central to the effectiveness of the model are the measurements of
resources (CPU, disc, memory etc.) used for each operation
performed by the system.

The Performance Test team is an integral part of the process. This
team designs and develops the workloads and scripts that are used
to:

° collect performance data to calibrate the models

° evaluate the systems under load and

° demonstrate that performance critical components can support
peak throughput

In a complex multi-layer solution like Pathway, volume end-to-end
testing is not a practical proposition. Therefore to yield the
information required, Pathway has devised a test plan covering:

° The performance evaluation of design options (prototyping/
design feedback)

° The calibration of modelling assumptions

° The measurement of components/subsystems under load

° The effect on performance of workload interaction

The performance tests have been constructed in such a way as to
ensure that the:

° Input & output data flows

° Input & output concurrency and

° The work processed within the platform

are representative of the full system and in particular the input to the

simulated environment must “look” the same to the system under test
as the production environment.

3.3.4 Performance management

Whilst the Performance Test team can measure performance using
representative workloads, the only true test of performance is the
production service.

To ensure that the production system have the capacity to deliver the
services and to identify potential hot-spots, a comprehensive set of
performance monitoring tools will be delivered as part of the systems
management framework for the system.

Tools will be developed to analyse and report on the data collected.

3.4 COUNTER SYSTEMS

3.4.1

Summary

The counter platform has already been scaled up significantly to a
Pentium Il, 400MHz, 64 Mb RAM, and 4.3Gb HDD. A further increase
in memory (128Mb) and disk size (10Gb), prior to National Rollout
has been approved. This is not to address performance issues, but
rather to avoid potential costly and disruptive changes of the outlet
hardware any earlier than absolutely necessary. It will, nonetheless,
help to resolve any potential unforeseen performance issues that may
arise in live running.

The counter platform has been significantly stressed. Performance
problems have been revealed and dealt with. Overall the platform
copes well with peak loads projected for NR2. The 20-counter test rig
has successfully emulated the load on an office on

° The first day after the office is automated when a heavy load of
OBCS ‘foreigns’ is predicted

. A peak on peak day at the end of rollout with multi-benefit by
card in operation,

and has tested all of the back-office functions. The testing emulated
13 weeks of peak operation so that the message store grew to a size
well beyond that of an operational of a 20 counter outlet. For 12 of the
13 weeks the peak on peak workload was run each day which
stressed the counter system well beyond the volumes that would be
processed in a live 20-Counter outlet. The message store was
populated with a typical mix of messages as at full rollout.

This testing has demonstrated that there is ample headroom to spare
for most customer facing operations. In particular, early fears that the
gateway counter may suffer adversely under load have been shown
to be ill founded. The 20-counter rig is being retained by Pathway and
it will be used for stress testing future releases.

The 20-Counter tests included an activity to build a representative
counter Message Store. This was achieved by running scripts on the
counter terminals that simulated operations at the counter. As
messages for more than 10 weeks were required, some of the scripts
were speeded up by reducing the think-type time for each counter
operation to reduce the elapsed time of the Message Store build
process. This had the effect of increasing the processing rate to many
times that which could be achieved in a normal outlet even on a peak
on peak day. Both Riposte and the counter systems demonstrated
that they could support this heavily over-scaled workload.

3.4.2

One problem area which will require management attention in the
early stages of the Live Trial, is that of counter replacement (e.g.
hardware swap out following failure). Here the tests and modelling
together project that counter replacement would run too slowly for
large outlets (greater than 6 counters) using simple Riposte bulk
replication to reproduce a fully populated Message Store. This should
not pose a threat for the existing outlets when they migrate from 1C to
NR2, but could be problematic with the larger outlets which are rolled
out shortly after the start of Live Trial. Initially even these would not
be affected. Only when the messages accumulate to significant levels
would the problem emerge (after about 4 weeks).

An alternative non-Riposte approach to introducing these large
Message Stores has been developed and tested, under CP 1541.

This will be intercepted prior to rollout of the new offices during Live
Trial and so will avoid the problem entirely.

3.4.2.1 Installation/replacement of a counter terminal

Test 2.1 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
the test are reported in document [REP001]. This test revealed that
for outlets with large Message Stores the planned method of
establishing the Message Store, using Riposte bulk replication, was
simply inappropriate. A new approach has been adopted (see
CP1541) which avoids the use of Riposte bulk replication, using
instead a simple file copy to generate the bulk of the Message Store.
This new approach has been tested before it is released and on a 20-
Counter outlet the time to restore the message store is <20 minutes.

The ‘old’ technique will be used initially but CP1541 has been
implemented and is in the final stages of testing. The revisions have
been downloaded to the counters using Tivoli and will be enabled
when the testing is complete and the change approved.

3.4.2.2 Sizing of the counter terminal disks

2

The discs in the counter PCs have grown in size from 1.6Gb through
4.3Gb to 10Gb ["]. The latest increase in size will be introduced at the
start of national rollout and was introduced in order to reduce the
possibility of a change becoming necessary in the future because of a
new requirement.

The message store on the PCs is predicted to grow to less than
700Mb in the largest outlet. The message store on the counter PCs
used in the 20-Counter test has grown to approximately 1Gb in size.
The difference is due to the workload being run on the 20-Counter rig
i.e. the peak on peak workload is run every day to stress the system.
In a normal outlets the peak on peak workload would only occur on
<5 days per year.

For single counter offices two 10Gb discs (one exchangeable the other fixed) will be configured

3.4.2.3 20-Counter Testing

The 20-counter test was designed to demonstrate that a large outlet
could support the heaviest load predicted and that all of the outlet
back-office functions could support the load generated in a very large
office with acceptable performance.

Tests:

2.3. Gateway counter terminal in a large outlet

2.5 Counter terminal non-functional performance

2.7 Stock control and accounting operations within an outlet

are all covered by the ’20 Counter Tests’ performed by the System
Test team. This set of tests has completed one cycle during which the
testing has been considerably expanded to provide a full stress test
of a large outlet including:

° Installation of a new counter terminal or replacement of counter
terminal or the disc in conjunction with peak daily operations at
the other terminals.

° Measure the responsiveness of the Gateway Counter terminal
during busy workload and interactions with the Correspondence
Server.

° Measure the impact of Cash Account production on Gateway PC
and during busy workload and interactions with the
Correspondence Server.

. Measure Counter performance at busy times, transactions to
include EPOSS, APS, BES encashments and OBCS
encashments, foreigns.

° Measure the responsiveness of Stock control procedures, with
38 Stock units.

° Measure the impact of balancing 20 Stock Units simultaneously,
rolling into new balance period and Cash week

° Measure how long it takes to produce a Trial Balance

° Measure how long it takes to roll the office balance into the next
Cash Account period

° Measure the time taken to perform end of day processing with a
full days activity recorded in the message store.

For completeness the test team also ran the full set of ad-hoc reports
to ensure that the performance of these operations was acceptable in
a large outlet. The results of the tests show that these reports are
produced in an acceptable time.

The results from the first cycle of tests are given in an interim report
[20 Counter]. These conclude that the counter systems hold up well in
all major respects under the peak on peak projected loads. Indeed
these tests overstress the platform as the mode of operation, using
automated data entry, operates much faster than would be the case
with human operators.

Early tests revealed some functional problems in the areas of stock
unit rollover and office CAP rollover when the system was operating
under stress. The issues have been investigated and the problems
corrected and the performance of these functions is more than
acceptable. These problems aside, the Office Rollover process at
these volumes has been timed at just 20 minutes.

For this testing the Gateway counter was also used as a normal
counter position which is unlikely in a large office. Even with this
additional load, processes on the Gateway counter were not
significantly impacted by volume traffic on the slave counters and
related ISDN traffic. Similarly, operation of the ISDN gateway
function, and servicing of messages from the slave counters is not
significantly impacted by processes on the Gateway counter.

ISDN links

The 20 Counter test (see §3.4.2.3) included testing of the ISDN link
from the counters to the campus. The 20 Counter Day 1 test was
representative of the load generated by OBCS ‘foreigns’ on the first
Monday after a 20 Counter outlet is automated. The tests showed that
the ISDN configuration in the Gateway PC could support the peak
NR2 workload.

Beyond the high connection rate load generated by NR2, test 2.4
cannot be economically tested without using the live network. As no
immediate risk arises from this area, it is planned that this test will be
run during the Live Trial, when an appropriate ‘quiet’ period will be
selected to conduct a bulk connection test of the ISDN network and
the Routers (ee also ISDN NETWORK (§3.11)). This will stress
concurrent ISDN connectivity to projected levels for full rollout.

Some outlets will be connected using Frame Relay at NR2. Frame
Relay was not included in this testing programme as in operation it is
very similar to ISDN with the exception that response times using
Frame Relay will be reduced because there is no call set-up time.
Riposte uses the same connection method for both ISDN and Frame
Relay. Testing therefore focussed on the performance of the worst
case connection method, i.e. ISDN.

Counter Test 2.5 to 2.7

Tests 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 include a number of fixed overheads. Quite
separately from the ’20 Counter Tests’ these have also been covered
in part (for small outlets with low transaction volumes) by the Model
Office Test. Early runs indicated that the timings for report production
(balance reports, etc.) were not acceptable. This was traced to a build
error, which had left the back office printers configured with their
default factory settings. Once corrected, the timings obtained were
reported as more than acceptable by the customer during the model
Office trial.

Printing receipts

The printing of receipts was an integral part of 20-counter testing. On
most of the counters the printers were emulated but several real
printers were configured for use during the tests.

All types of receipts were tested and printed. The test results showed
that, even under heavy load conditions, printing commenced in less
than one second (assuming the slip is in the printer).

3.5 CORRESPONDENCE SERVERS

3.5.1

Summary

The Correspondence Server layer of the architecture has been
extensively tested and modelled. A significant amount of the testing
has used workload volumes and Message Stores that are
representative of full rollout.

The tests and modelling conducted for the NR2 implementation of the
Correspondence Server platform indicate that many of the
Correspondence Server processes, including counter replication, are
capable of operating at close to full rollout volumes. The single
exception is when Riposte Archiving is run in parallel with other
Riposte activity (see §3.5.2.4)

Testing initially concentrated on measurements of each service
functioning separately to provide resource data for modelling.
However, later tests (Tests 3.4 and 3.7) have emulated the
Correspondence Server running the set of services that would run
concurrently in live operation. The results indicate that the
Correspondence Server can easily support the workload generated
on the heaviest day during the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets, with
significant headroom for expansion.

During the development of NR2, the Correspondence Server
configurations have been upgraded with EMC? disc sub-systems that
provide greatly enhanced resilience features. A by-product of the
move to EMC? disc technology is a gain in performance because the
EMC? disc sub-systems are configured with large, highly resilient
caches that provide higher throughput for many Correspondence
Server operations. In addition, the use of EMC? BCVs allows for a
revised Correspondence Server backup and restore strategy that
reduces the time a Correspondence Server node is out-of-service for
backup. This will become more important in the future as the opening
hours of the outlets lengthens.

For NR2, Pathway has also intercepted new Correspondence Server
hardware. On each campus there are four pairs (master and backup)
of Correspondence Servers providing fast failover in the unlikely
event of a failure. The backup Correspondence Servers will use
COMPAQ 4-way Intel Xeon servers. The additional power provided
by new servers is not required at NR2, but the move will ensure that
there is sufficient headroom and contingency for full rollout. The
master Correspondence Servers will be upgraded later in the
programme but well before the additional power is required.

3.6.2.1

It should be noted that all the tests conducted in this area so far have
excluded the effects of ISDN delays and connect times. It is planned
that this area will be explored thoroughly in future tests for volumes >
8,000 outlets, using sophisticated simulation techniques. In the
meantime, whilst it is likely that there will be an effect on
performance, it is relatively small. With so much headroom
demonstrated this certainly does not constitute a risk at NR2
volumes. For further details of ISDN testing and Modelling see §3.11 -

Performance Assessment

Section 3 of [Requirements] specifies the agreed set of tests. These
consist of:

8.1 Replication from Counter System to Correspondence Server

8.2 Harvesting BES transactions from the Correspondence Server

8.4 Concurrent Riposte Replication and Riposte Archiving

8.5 BPS Payment Authorisation Bulk Loader

8.6 Correspondence Server Riposte Archiving

8.7 Correspondence Server Workload Evaluation

Replication from Counter System to Correspondence Server

Test 3.1 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
the test are reported in [REP002].

This test measured the rate at which Riposte messages could be
replicated from the gateway PC in the outlet to the Correspondence
Server, and the load on the Correspondence Server generated by
many outlets performing this process concurrently.

The results of this test were not as expected. On investigation it was
discovered that our understanding of the Riposte interactions
between the Gateway Counter and the Correspondence Server was
deficient and as a result the test had been incorrectly configured. The
lessons learnt from this test were taken into account when preparing
test 3.4, which was extended to cover the objectives of test 3.1. The
results for 3.4 are reviewed in §3.5.2.4, which also covers the results
of test 3.6, Riposte Archiving.

Further improvements in the method of simulating Counter to
Correspondence Server replication were implemented in Tests 8.2
(see §3.10.2.2and Test 3.7 (see §3.5.2.7).

The tests that measured the peak hour replication load demonstrated
that the Correspondence Server platform could just cope with
replication for projected loads at full rollout volumes in the peak hour.
This is well in excess of the demands the system will encounter for
NR2.

3.5.2.2 Harvesting BES transactions from the Correspondence Server

Test 3.2 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results
are reported in [REP003].

The test measured the rate at which BES messages could be
harvested from a Correspondence Server, and the load on the
Correspondence Server generated by one or more bulk harvester
agents harvesting BES messages concurrently.

This test demonstrated that the Correspondence Server can cope
comfortably with projected BES Harvesting loads up to and beyond
full rollout volumes.

The testing method used in Test 3.2 did not include the cycling of the
Bulk Harvester Agents which will take place in the live service every
15 minutes or so. However, as the number of messages that are
generated during the heaviest hour of heaviest day during the rollout
of the first 8,000 outlets (460K) take less than 10 minutes to harvest
when one site is in operation, there is a significant amount of
headroom remaining in the system. With so much headroom this
does not constitute a risk at NR2 volumes.

See also BES Agent (§3.6.2.2) and BPS Host (§3.7.2.2).
3.5.2.3 Harvesting TPS transactions from the Correspondence Server

Test 3.3 was performed by the Performance Test team. It was
combined with Test 4.8, and the results are reported in [REP010].

This test measured the Correspondence Server under the load that
would be expected on the heaviest day in an average week at full
rollout i.e. approximately 40M TPS messages would be harvested in
total. The expected peak on peak rate at full rollout is approximately
53M messages and the TPS harvesting model [MOD019] predicts
that on the heaviest day during the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets
<15M messages would be harvested.

This test demonstrated that the Correspondence Server can cope
comfortably with projected TPS Harvesting loads up to and beyond
full rollout volumes.

3.5.2.4 Concurrent Riposte Replication and Riposte Archiving

Test 3.4 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results
are reported in [REP004].

This test combined Tests 3.1(Riposte replication) and 3.6 (Riposte
archiving). For this test the deficiencies identified in Test 3.1 were
removed so that the mechanism used by Riposte for replicating
messages from the outlets to the Correspondence Server was
representative of the live system.

During the peak hour at full rollout, approximately 3.6K messages per
second will be replicated from the counters to the Correspondence
Server, i.e. approximately 0.9K messages per second per
Correspondence Server.

The tests that measured the peak hour replication load demonstrated
that the Correspondence Server platform could support loads up to
1.1K messages per second. This is well in excess of the 0.2K
messages per second per Correspondence Server that the model
[mod024] predicts that the system will encounter at NR2.

However, the test also revealed a problem in running Riposte
Archiving alongside general Riposte Replication, under stress. The
problem was severe and has been referred to our supplier, Escher.
As a result Pathway has changed the planned operational schedule
for running Riposte Archiving, such that it will be run in dedicated
time, not competing with other Riposte activity on the
Correspondence Server. There is more than sufficient time to
schedule this with NR2 volumes, and potentially enough to cope right
up to full rollout volumes, though this position will need to be
monitored beyond 8000 outlets. This approach entirely avoids the
problem.

Test 3.4 was extended further in Test 3.7 (see §3.5.2.7)

3.5.2.5 BPS Payment Authorisation Bulk Loader

Test 3.5 (Correspondence Server) has been combined with Test 4.5
(Agent) and is being conducted by the Performance Test team. The
results are reported in [REPOOS5].

The capability of the CAPS Payment Authorisation Data loader to
support full workload volumes was modelled early in the development
cycle. The model identified that the performance of CAPS Payment
Authorisation Data loading would be disc limited due to the large
number of Riposte index updates and would not achieve the required
level of throughput. A performance review resulted in CP1510 being
raised. This CP reduced the number of indexes that would be
updated by the load process. At the same time, the rate at which disc
transfers can be performed has been significantly increased by the
introduction of EMC? disc arrays for the Riposte Message Store. The
EMC? arrays have large resilient caches that smooth the write traffic
to the discs, increasing the maximum disc throughput of the
Correspondence Servers.

The CAPS Payment Authorisation Data loader was measured using
the expected load that will be generated on the heaviest day during
the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets. The measurement test loaded
950K payment authorisations into a Correspondence Server. This test
assumed that all of the high volume benefits would be paid by card.
With NR2 rollout volumes up to 8,000 outlets, the model [MOD020]
predicts that payment authorisation volumes will be <900K on the
peak night even if multi benefit is applied i.e. approximately 220K
payment authorisations per Correspondence Server. With Child
Benefit only, the payment authorisation volumes are even lower. The
test of a single Correspondence Server therefore more than covers
our position for NR2 volumes.

The test demonstrated that 950K payment authorisations were loaded
into a Correspondence Server cluster in 1.5 hours, including the
indexing of all new messages in Riposte. The test measured bulk
loader agents loading Payment Authorisations into both nodes of the
Correspondence Server cluster concurrently. For 8,000 outlets the
expected elapsed time to run the Payment Authorisation bulk loader
is <30 minutes in single site operation.

3.5.2.6 Correspondence Server Riposte Archiving

Riposte archiving is the process by which messages that have
expired (i.e. have exceeded the time a message should remain in the
Message Store) are deleted from the Message Store. Each node in a
cluster of Correspondence Servers is archived separately.

Because of the problems described in §3.5.2.4, the measurement of
Test 3.6 was delayed pending the resolution by Escher of the
problems identified in this test. The Performance Test team has
produced an interim report [REP050] on the tests that have been run
on Riposte internal archiving. Further testing will be undertaken
before the start of national rollout.

An engineering model produced to evaluate the NR2 design identified
that the proposed design would not enable the Message Store to be
archived within the time available within the full rollout schedule. A
design review with our supplier, Escher, identified a number of
enhancements to Riposte archiving that will be implemented in the
Riposte 6 release.

The release 5.4 implementation of archiving was tested using a
Message Store fully populated with the messages, persistent objects,
reference data, etc for 2,000 outlets [°]. The tests confirmed that each
Correspondence Server could be archived in less than 10 hours per
week. The Correspondence Servers will be archived in parallel. The
NR2 schedule has allocated 15 hours to archive the Correspondence
Servers.

? At 8,000 outlets, each of the four Correspondence Servers will support approximately
2,000 outlets

3.5.2.7 Correspondence Server Workload Evaluation

Test 3.7 represented the next stage of stress testing and builds upon
Test 3.4. This test measured the load on a Correspondence Server
cluster during the peak hour on the busiest day during the rollout of
the first 8,000 outlets. This test combines the workload components
from earlier tests into a stress test of the Correspondence Server i.e.:

° Replication from the counter systems to the Correspondence
Server (Test 3.1 & 3.4)

. Replication of messages between Correspondence Server
nodes

. BES Harvesting (test 3.2)
° Gathering the Audit tracks (Test 8.2)
° Processing OBCS ‘foreigns’ (Test 7.1)

Test 3.7 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results
are reported in [REP007].

This test used the full NR2 Correspondence Server configuration
(CP1498) including EMC? discs. The use of EMC? discs removed the
50Gb size constraint from the Message Store that had applied to
earlier tests. This change permitted the construction of a Message
Store with a full set of messages including persistent objects. The
Message Store used for this test represented the volumes of
messages generated by 8,000 outlets.

The first part was a confirmatory test for Riposte Replication only that
demonstrated that the revised EMC? based platform does not
degrade performance. The remaining tests were geared towards
stressing the platform under mixed workloads and to confirm that
Riposte performance does not suffer as a result of operating mixed
loads under stress.

The tests demonstrated that even on the heaviest day at the end of
the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets, the NR2 Correspondence Servers
can support the peak hour workload without any degradation. In
particular the test confirmed the viability of the EMC? based platform.

The results also confirmed that the current Pentium Pro 200Mhz
Correspondence Server platform would not have sufficient power to
support the full rollout peak on peak volumes. Pathway has already
invoked the scalability plan for the Correspondence Server platform
(see CP1814). This new platform will be stress tested during a future
phase of performance testing.

The tests and modelling of the Agent Server platform indicate that it is
capable of supporting up to full rollout volumes for most of the Bulk
Harvester and Loader operations. The modelling of the TPS Bulk
Harvester indicates that more instances of the TPS Bulk Harvester

3.6.2.1 TPS Bulk Harvester Agent

Tests 4.1 and 4.2 were performed by the Performance Test team.
Some time after the tests had been completed it was discovered that
a number of the test cases had been incorrectly configured and some
of the Agent processing (i.e. the Host TPS database accesses) was
not included in the measurements.

However, TPS has been the subject of a number of tests, so the
results from 4.1 that remain meaningful, were combined with the
results from the design feedback tests, [REP044] and [REP045], to
produce the agent model. The tests documented in [REP044] used a
number of Agent servers running concurrently to load the SE70 Host.
The results for test 4.1 are reported in [REPOO9]. The results from
Test 4.2 all contained the fault so this report has been withdrawn. A
re-test will be scheduled to re-run the test at some future point in
order to confirm behaviour patterns for multiple servers with a full
configuration. However, this work is not urgent as it relates to high
volumes beyond those projected for NR2.

These results, coupled with modelling projections [MOD019], indicate
that 16 Agent servers can easily cope with the projected NR2 loads of
<15M messages. On the heaviest day during the rollout of the first
8,000 outlets, TPS harvesting will complete well before the 20:30 cut-
off time. The agent model [MOD019] predicts that whilst the Agent
servers remain moderately loaded during TPS harvesting (<40% cpu
loading), the Host cpu is almost fully utilised by 64 TPS bulk
harvester agents running concurrently. The limiting factor in
throughput is therefore the Host and not the Agent.

However, when only one site is in operation the number of scheduled
TPS Bulk Harvester processes currently scheduled is insufficient to
process the heaviest projected number of TPS messages before the
20:30 cut-off defined in the NR2 Maestro schedule. Up to 6,500
outlets can be harvested before 20:30 with only one site in operation.

The combination of a site out with a peak workload night is unlikely to
occur but Pathway has to plan for such eventualities. If such an event
occurs, the cut-off time will be extended by a period of approximately
30 minutes. This will have no impact on the delivery of files to BA or
POCL/TIP. Any impact will be taken by Pathway by delaying the
delivery of the TPS output to the Pathway Data Warehouse.

FOR NR2 Issue: 2.0
Date: 07/06/99

In the long-term, to support workloads beyond that generated on
heaviest day by 6,500 outlets with only a single site available, and
without compromising delivery times to the Data Warehouse,
Pathway is reviewing a number of options including:

° Increasing the number of TPS bulk harvesters per Agent server
and

° Upgrading the specification of the Agent servers

° Implementing separate Maestro schedules for single and two-
site working.

There is sufficient spare processor power in the NR2 Agent server
configurations to support the number of harvester processes required
to complete the task before the 20:30 cut-off up to 8,000 outlets.

Further evaluation of the Agent servers running TPS harvesting is
planned. This testing will include testing using higher specification
Agent servers against a NUMA-Q Host, as more TPS bulk harvester
agents may be required to keep the NUMA-Q fully utilised.

See also TPS Correspondence Server (§3.5.2.3) and TPS Host
(§3.7.2.4).

3.6.2.2 BES Bulk Harvester Agent

Test 4.3 was performed by the Performance Test team, and the
results are reported in [REP011].

The BES Bulk Harvester agent operates throughout the working day
(07:00 to 20:00). One BES bulk harvester agent runs on each of the
16 agent servers.

This test demonstrated (making projections from 3000 outlets up to
20000 outlets) that Pathway can cope comfortably with BES
Harvesting loads up to full rollout volumes, peak on peak.

At NR2 the TPS harvesting model [MOD019] predicts that the number
of messages that are generated during the heaviest hour of the
heaviest day during the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets (460K) will
take less than 10 minutes to harvest when one site is in operation. As
there is little other activity on the Agent servers 09:00-17:30, the
utilisation of the Agent servers whilst the BES bulk harvesters are
running will be very low. The TPS harvesters are loaded at 12:00, but
the volume of data harvested from the outlets that close before 17:30
is small and there is more than sufficient capacity to support
concurrent TPS & BES Harvesting and interactive processes during
the afternoon even on a peak day.

OBCS Bulk Harvester Agent

Test 4.4 was performed by the Performance Test team, and the
results are reported in [REP012].

The tests demonstrated that Pathway can cope with harvesting OBCS
encashments up to the peak predicted OBCS volumes.

However, it should be noted that this test was based on OBCS
dealing only with a maximum of 25% of the benefit load. If the system
remains Child Benefit only, right through to full rollout volumes, then
this assumption is broken, with OBCS accounting for more like 90%
of benefit payments. The results still leave us comfortable under
these circumstances at the 8,000 outlet level, but beyond that the
schedule would need to be adjusted to allow OBCS processing to
benefit from the missing BPS load.

At NR2 volumes with multi-benefit by card in operation the OBCS
harvesting model [MOD018] predicts that the number of messages
that are generated during the heaviest hour of heaviest day during
the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets (1.25M) will take approximately 20
minutes to harvest when one site is in operation

are reported in [REP014].

The Reference Data Bulk Loader loads changes to the reference data
from the Host to the Correspondence Server. The volumes of data will
be very variable and difficult to predict. The pattern of changes
cannot be modelled. The pattern and volume of changes will be
monitored during national rollout and the data collected will be used
to re-work the model predictions and, if necessary, further testing will
be carried out.

ICL Pathway PERFORMANCE SUMMARY REPORT ®ef PAIPER/O16
FOR NR2 Issue: 2.0
Date: 07/06/99

The Reference Data Bulk Loader requirement has been measured
using the heaviest known workload during the rollout of the first 8,000
outlets, i.e. the loading of reference data into 100 newly automated
outlets. This will generate more than 1.6M core and over 66K non-
core items of reference data.

One copy of the core (data common to all outlets) data is loaded into
a virtual outlet [*] on the Correspondence Server using the bulk loader
agent. This set of data is then copied from the virtual outlet to each
new outlet using a Replicator agent. The agent reads the ‘Active
Outlets Table’ in the Host database to determine the outlets to which
reference data is to be replicated. This agent runs a number of copies
in parallel. The non-core or outlet-specific data is loaded from the
Host directly into the outlet on the Correspondence Server.

The Reference Data loader model [MOD023] predicts that to load the
reference data into 100 newly automated outlets on the
Correspondence Server will take approximately 3 hours with only one
site in operation. To download the reference data to the outlets will
take approximately 45 minutes. The two processes overlap as the
reference data is downloaded to an outlet soon after the new
reference data is written into the message run for that outlet. This
process will complete well before the 03:00 cut-off in the NR2
schedule, even with only one site in operation.

3.6.2.6 APS Bulk Harvester

Test 4.7 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results
are reported in [REP039].

The APS Bulk Harvester transfers messages associated with
automated payments from the Correspondence Server to an ORACLE
database on the Host system. In the NR2 Maestro schedule, the APS
bulk harvester runs after the TPS bulk harvester has completed.

The volumes of automated payments defined in the Workload Brief
[BRIEF] amount to only 68 million per year, whilst current observed
levels amount to about 150 million per year. The test was run using
volumes approaching 200 million

The APS bulk harvester test demonstrated that the agents can
comfortably support projected APS harvesting loads up to full rollout
volumes. Clearly if the AP volumes continue to rise then this position
will need to be monitored.

At NR2 the AP loader model [MOD017] predicts that the number of
messages that will be generated on heaviest day during the rollout of
the first 8,000 outlets is approximately 380K. These will take less than
30 minutes to harvest when one site is in operation.

The tests indicated that beyond 8,000 outlets the elapsed time to
harvest AP messages could be reduced by increasing the number of
APS bulk harvester agent processes

3.6.2.7 Cluster Lookup Agent

Test 4.8 was combined with test 3.3. Test 4.8 was performed by the
Performance Test team. The results are reported in [REP010].

The purpose of the Cluster Lookup Service is to enable the mapping
of:

. Groups (i.e. Post Offices) onto Correspondence Server Clusters
and

° Correspondence Servers onto NT machines
to be isolated from the agents.

Test 4.8 was designed to measure the time taken to re-establish the
Cluster Look-up Agent following a failure. A test of the CLU Agent on
a Correspondence Server with 5000 outlets demonstrated that the
CLU Agent could re-establish itself in < 2 minutes. At NR2, the CLU
Agent also should take < 2 minutes as there will be <2000 outlets per
Correspondence Server. As CLU Agents run on all Correspondence
Servers and Agents the loss on one agent will be minimal.

3.6.2.8 OBCS Stops Bulk Loader

Test 4.9 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
OBCS Stops Bulk Loader testing are reported in [REP016].

The OBCS Stops bulk loader loads Stops from OBCS ORACLE
database on the Host into the Correspondence Server. This process
takes place overnight. There is also an interactive agent to handle
‘emergency stops’ which runs during the day. Most of the OBCS
Stops will be processed by the bulk loader.

The OBCS Stops bulk loader Agents have been tested up to twice the
volumes predicted for the heaviest day during the rollout of the first
8,000 outlets. The results indicate that the agents can comfortably
support projected OBCS Stops harvesting loads up to the maximum
volumes predicted for OBCS.

Change of Nominated Post Office Bulk Loader

Test 4.10 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results
of the CNOMPOS are reported in [REP031].

CNOMPOS provides the capability of moving customers between
outlets. Such changes can occur because:

° The customer requests the change at the Post Office
° The customer requests the change at a BA office or
° A Post Office has been closed (temporary or permanent).

CNOMPOS changes are loaded each night (Monday to Friday) by
CNOMPOS bulk loader agents running on the Agent servers. All valid
changes notified to Pathway by 20:00 should be available at the
counter by 08:00 the following morning. However Pathway should
notify CAPS of changes that have been made by 03:00. The schedule
target for the completion of this task is therefore 03:00.

An engineering model produced to evaluate the NR2 design identified
that the proposed NR2 design would be heavily I/O limited and would
not be able to provide the turnaround required. The modelling work
resulted in a re-evaluation of the design, and a revised design which
minimised the amount of data moved between the ‘old’ and the ‘new’
post office was documented in CP1398. The first phase of the design
change has been implemented at NR2. Beyond NR2 the design will
be further refined to remove the requirement to move message data
between outlets. This design will support the volumes predicted for
full rollout.

The CNOMPOS model uses the test measurements of CNOMPOS
that included moving customers between two outlets on the same
Correspondence Server and between two outlets on different
Correspondence Servers. Closure of an outlet was also tested.

On the heaviest day during the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets, the
CNOMPOS model [MOD022] predicts that 37K CNOMPOS requests
will be processed. The CNOMPOS model predicts that it will take less
than 1 hour to process 37K CNOMPOS requests with single site
operation. The NR2 Host processing model [MOD024] predicts that
CNOMPOS will complete before 01:15 in single site operation.

3.7 HOST SERVERS

3.7.1 Summary
The Host platform has been extensively tested and modelled.

All of the testing focussed on demonstrating that a single 10-way
Sequent SE70 server could support the Host workload at NR2 and at
full rollout. At NR2 all of the Host workload (TPS, APS, OBCS and
PAS/CMS) runs on one 10-way SE70, with the other SE70 providing
the failover capability.

In order to ensure that the testing was as representative as possible a
joint test team was formed from members of the:

. Pathway Performance Test team,
° ORACLE PAS/CMS design and development team and
° Sequent support team.

This testing team, known as the ORACLE Joint Working (OJW) team
designed, set-up and ran a set of load tests on the Host system. This
testing combined the stress testing of the Host applications by the
ORACLE development team with performance testing.

The tests represented the key components of the Host overnight
batch schedule i.e. TPS, PAS/CMS, OBCS and APS. The tests
emulated the heaviest load that is predicted at three points in the
rollout:

° 50% workload
° 100% workload on the peak day in an average week
° 100% workload on the peak day in an peak week

During the rollout the workload profile changes as cards replace
books. Therefore a different message mix was used for the 50% and
the 100% cases representing the profiles that are predicted by the
workload volumes model [MOD026].

The 50% case ran OBCS, PAS/CMS, APS and TPS on a single 10-
way SE70(see §3.7.2.5). The test demonstrated that the overnight
schedule for the peak day with 8,000 outlets rolled out could be
supported on a single SE70 server with spare capacity to cover
operational contingencies. The results from this test confirmed the
predictions from the engineering models that a single SE70 would not
support full rollout volumes.

FOR NR2 Date 07/06/99

The 100% average week case ran PAS/CMS and APS on an SE70 to
prove that these applications would scale to support the workload
generated by 20,000 outlets (see §0). The test results demonstrated
that a single SE70 could support this workload but with little spare
capacity for operational contingency. All of the applications scaled
well to the volumes generated by 20,000 outlets.

A 10-way SE70 could also support TPS volumes in excess of NR2
volumes (see §3.7.2.4) but the TPS model predicts that a single SE70
could not support the peak on peak volumes generated at full rollout.

As the previous two cases demonstrated, the SE70 reaches its limit
beyond 8,000 outlets at peak, and Pathway will have to invoke the
Host scaleability strategy before that limit is reached, in order to
preserve the desired levels of contingency.

For the 100% peak week case the Host PAS/CMS batch workload
was migrated to, and measured on, an early model in the NUMA-Q
range (see §3.7.2.7). The database discs were disconnected from the
SE70 and connected to the NUMA-Q without any changes. The
transition of the application environment from SE70 to NUMA-Q was
tested and this was achieved with minimal change. The test results
demonstrate that the NUMA-Q platform will:

° provide sufficient power to support the full rollout volumes peak
on peak and

° ensure that there is sufficient contingency in the overnight batch
schedule to cope with operational incidents.

On the NUMA-Q platforms, further evaluation of key processes such
as TPS Bulk harvesting is planned to ensure that the full power of the
NUMA-Q systems can be exploited.

The disc sub-systems on the SE70 Host systems that support the
ORACLE databases are high performance and availability Symmetrix
systems from EMC?. There is one Host Symmetrix system at each
site. The Symmetric Remote Data Facility (SRDF) enables the
databases to be mirrored across the sites with the minimum impact on
performance. The Symmetrix systems were benchmarked [SRDF] for
Release 1c and the tests showed that the impact on elapsed times
was <5%.

The test measured the time for the Host to harvest and process a

The test harvested 6M messages against the target for 8,000 outlets
of approximately 1.1M (1.1M Encashments and 20k Administration)
messages. The test was run at these volumes to ensure that the
system could support greatly increased volumes if the rate of
replacement of books by cards is different to that in the workload
definition [VOLS]. The workload definition [MOD026] predicts that
OBCS Encashments will peak at below 1.5M per day as cards replace
books.

3.7.2.2

The OBCS harvesting model is based on the results from the
performance tests. For 8,000 outlets the model predicts that 1.1M
OBCS (Encashment and Administration) messages will be harvested
in approximately 20 minutes in single site operation. This is
acceptable as OBCS harvesting is performed in parallel with TPS and
APS Host processing and will complete before OBCS Host
processing will be started by the Maestro scheduler.

BPS Host Processing

Test 5.2 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
the BPS harvester test are reported in [REP032]. The results from
processing the harvested messages on the Host are reported in
[REP035].

The test measured the time for the Host to harvest the number of BPS
Payment Authorisations (6.6M Encashments and 7.9M Payments)
that would be generated on the peak day in an average week with
20,000 outlets rolled out.

The BPS Host processing model is divided into two parts:

° The BPS Harvesting model (see [MOD020]) and
. The BPS Host processing model (see [MOD024)).

The BPS Host processing forms part of the Host workload test (see
§3.7.2.5).

The BPS harvesting model is based on the results from the
performance tests. The test assumed that BPS harvesting was
performed in a similar way to TPS and OBCS harvesting, i.e. a single
harvesting operation at end-of-day. However, the BPS harvesting
process runs in many batches throughout the day (07:30 to 20:00).

A BPS bulk harvester agent runs on each of the 16 Agent servers.
Throughout the day, Maestro starts BPS bulk harvester on the Agent
servers. The BPS bulk harvester agent harvests messages that are
available to be harvested then closes. When a bulk harvester has
closed, Maestro detects the closure and re-starts the bulk harvester.
The cost associated with this additional processing has been
estimated in the model and will be measured during a later phase of
performance testing.

For 8,000 outlets the model predicts that BPS harvesting will take less
than 10 elapsed minutes out of the available 1 hour to harvest the
460K messages generated in the peak hour.

Test 5.3 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
the Host bulk loader test are reported in [REP034]. The results from
processing the payment authorisations on the Host are reported in
[REP035].

Test 5.3 measured the cost on the Host of loading approximately

heaviest day during the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets almost 900K
messages will be loaded by the CAPS Payment Authorisation Data
loader agent. This process takes place at the end of the overnight
schedule and the data must be at the counter before the start of
business i.e. 08:00. With only one site in operation the loading
process will take less than 30 minutes and will finish before 05:00.

3.7.2.4 TPS Host Processing

Test 5.4 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
the TPS bulk harvester test are reported in [REP031]. The results
from processing the harvested messages on the Host are reported in
[REP035].

TPS Host testing was undertaken using the workload generated by
10,000 outlets on a peak day in an average week. Testing of TPS on
an SE70 did not exceed 10,000 outlets as early engineering models
of the TPS workload indicated that a single SE70 platform could not
support the full TPS Host workload up to full roll-out volumes. An
early decision therefore was therefore required about where TPS
would be hosted. Should it be:

. hosted on a more powerful Host than the SE70?

° run on a separate Host platform to PAS/CMS and APS?

° re-developed to run on a different platform?

The SE70 reaches its limit beyond 8,000 outlets at peak, and
Pathway will have to invoke the Host scaleability strategy before that

limit is reached to support the volumes predicted at full rollout peak
on peak.

The TPS Host processing model is divided into two parts:

° The TPS Harvesting model (see [MOD019]) and
° The TPS Host processing model (see [MOD024]).

The TPS Host processing forms part of the Host workload test (see
§3.7.2.5).

The window for harvesting TPS messages runs from 12:00 to 20:30
Monday to Saturday, but as TPS harvesting cannot be initiated until
after the end-of-day marker has been received by the Host, most of
the TPS harvesting will take place after 18:00.

The TPS harvesting model is based on the results from the
performance tests. For 8,000 outlets the model predicts that on the
SE70, harvesting will take approximately 1.5 hours with two sites in
operation, but just over 3 hours with only one site working. This latter
figure means that all of the EPOSS messages would not be harvested
before the harvesters are closed at 20:30. This limitation is due to the
number of instances of the TPS Bulk Harvester agent that are running
i.e. 32 instead of the 64 with two-site operation. Pathway is reviewing
the number of TPS Bulk Harvester agents and the power of agents
required to support single site operation.

3.7.2.5 Concurrent Host Workloads (8000 outlets)

Test 5.5 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
the SE70 50% workload test are reported in [REP035].

Test 5.5 measured a representative overnight batch cycle using 50%
of the volumes generated on the heaviest day at full rollout. This test
formed part of the ORACLE Joint Working (OJW) project that
involved the ORACLE PAS/CMS design & development team,
Sequent and the Pathway Performance Test team. The test revealed
that for volumes representative of NR2, the Sequent SE70 Host could
support the full overnight batch processing schedule with sufficient
operational contingency for fails and re-runs.

The OJW team worked with the Pathway Maestro schedule team to
validate and improve the overnight batch schedule for NR2 using the
results from Test 5.5.

The workload model is based on the results from the performance
tests together with the schedule start and finish points derived from
the business model and the SLAs.

3.7.2.6

For 8,000 outlets the Host Processing model [MOD024] predicts that
the overnight batch schedule will be completed by 05:00, even if only
one site is in operation.

Concurrent Host Workloads (20000 outlets, average week)

Test 5.6 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
Test 5.6 are reported in [REPO36]. This test also formed part of the
ORACLE Joint Working project.

Test 5.6 measured a representative overnight PAS/CMS and APS
Host batch schedule using the volumes predicted for the heaviest day
in an average week at full rollout. TPS is not included in this test as
the test was designed to test PAS/CMS at high volumes. The test
revealed that for volumes up to full rollout volumes (not peak on
peak), the 10-way Sequent SE70 Host could execute the overnight
batch processing schedule but there was minimal time left in the
schedule for operational contingency.

Since this test was run, the projected CNOMPOS volumes have been
revised upwards (see §3.6.2.9 ). With this additional load, the SE70
would not complete the overnight PAS/CMS schedule before the start
of the next working day on the heaviest nights even in an average
week. However, it is planned that the design of CNOMPOS will
change at NR2* to provide a performant solution for 20,000 outlets.

The SE70 can support more than 8,000 but less than 20,000 outlets
running the overnight PAS/CMS and APS batch schedule. Pathway
has therefore decided to implement its Host scalability strategy and
replace the SE70 Host systems with Sequent NUMA-Q 2000 systems
at or before 8,000 outlets have been rolled out.

A workload model for 20,000 outlets is planned.

Test 5.7 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
the NUMA-Q peak on peak workload test are reported in [REP036].

Test 5.7 measured a representative overnight PAS/CMS and APS
batch schedule using peak on peak of full rollout volumes. The test
revealed that the key components of the PAS/CMS overnight batch
workload ran between 33 and 123% faster on the NUMA-Q system [°].
Pathway has therefore decided to implement the scalability strategy
for the Host systems and replace the SE70 systems with NUMA-Q
2000 systems.

A workload model for 20,000 outlets is planned.

® The NUMA-Q system used in the tests was configured with 8-way 200MHz processors.

3.8 DATA TRANSFERS TO/FROM HOST SERVERS

3.8.1

3.8.2

Summary

The interface between Pathway and its customers and suppliers
involves the movement of large volumes of data both ways. Most of
this data is transferred in bulk using the FTMS service or NFS. The
interactive transfer of data to/from the Pathway system is reviewed in
§3.9.

There are many services linking into Pathway but most of these
services either support low volumes or are one of a set of similar
services. A small subset of the key services was chosen for detailed
testing and modelling. Each of these services carries large volumes
of data and is subject to an SLA for the delivery of data.

The testing of the CAPS Batch interface has been performed jointly
with ITSA and they have produced a report on the resources required
to support the VME side of the interface. The report indicates that the
measured load on the VME systems is less than had been expected.

The bulk data transfer services have been tested at volumes
representative of those that will be achieved at full rollout which are
considerably in excess of the volumes that will be generated on the
busiest day during the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets. The test
results were included in the NR2 workload model [MOD024], which
indicates that all of the relevant SLAs can be achieved with sufficient
headroom for contingency.

For NR2 the bulk data transfer services have been tested but not
modelled. For full rollout this component of the workload will be
modelled and the results will provide input into the workload model for
20,000 outlets. The OAS workload has not been measured. It is
similar in profile to CAPS Batch but unlike CAPS Batch, the worst
case i.e. the download of the national stops file, has already been
completed on the live system.

3.8.2.1 CAPS File Transfer Interface

Test 6.1 was performed as part of the CAPS Joint Interface project.
The results of the tests are reported on in [REP037].

The Performance Test team and an ITSA team jointly produced the
test plan and testing was run as a joint exercise. The ITSA team
provided the VME components of the test and the message generator
and the Performance Test team the Pathway PAS/CMS Host
environment.

Files of data are sent to the CAPS Access Service (CAS) running on
VME mainframes in the Benefits Agency. All files that are received by
CAS up to 20:00 each evening are to be processed by Pathway as
part of the overnight batch schedule. The transfer of data from CAS is
scheduled to take place several times a day so only a small amount
of data should be transferred to Pathway after 19:00. Each file could
contain up to 40K transactions. In a peak on peak day 7.8M
transactions will be transferred from CAPS to Pathway. Up to 8,000
outlets the volumes are less than 900K.

The projections derived from the measurements show that the cost of
transferring data is lower than had been projected because only one
process on the VME service is transaction based i.e. the costs are
per transaction. The other VME services are file based.

The time to transfer a file with 40K payment authorisations was
< 2minutes. The total elapsed time on the VME systems per day at
full rollout has been estimated to be approximately 5 hours [CAPS],
spread across 3 BA VME systems.

3.8.2.2 Host to TIP PC interface

Test 6.2 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
the TIP transfer test are reported in [REP039]. Additional testing has
been undertaken as part of TIP Interface Testing (see [VolStrat3]).

The TIP interface handles all of the EPOSS data being transferred
from Pathway to the POCL TIP system. Up to 64 data files (plus a few
small control files) are generated by the TPS Host processing suite
and transferred to POCL. Each file contains the EPOSS messages for
a set of outlets. On the heaviest day during the rollout of the first
8,000 outlets, approximately 12.5M messages are transferred to TIP.
This increases to approximately 53M on a peak on peak day at full
rollout.

Test 6.2 used a set of files generated by the TPS Host Processing
test (see §3.7.2.4) to measure the time to transfer files of different
sizes.

From the measurements it is estimated that the time to transfer the
files to TIP will take less than 1.5 hours. However, most of the file
transfer time is overlapped with the TPS processing which generates
the files, as each file is available to be transferred to TIP as soon as
processing of the file is complete. The files are required to be at TIP
by 03:00, but the NR2 Host processing model [MOD024] predicts that
they will normally be available before 23:00. This assumes that the
TIP links are reconfigured from two 1Mbit links to one 2Mb link as the
FTMS service cannot use the two 1Mb links concurrently (CP1741).

The testing in [REP039] used a low latency WAN link that is not
representative of the live system. However, the testing in [VolStrat3]
used the live WAN links from Bootle to Hulthwaite and this testing
gave an accurate measurement of the transfer rate that can be
achieved across the network

3.8.2.3 TIP PC to PC file Transfer
Test 6.3 was performed by the Performance Test team.
For the assessment of test 6.3 See §3.8.2.2

3.8.2.4 MIS File Transfer

Test 6.4 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
the MIS File Transfer test are reported in [REP040].

In §3.8.2.2 the interface from Host TPS to POCL TIP was measured.
Host TPS has a second major datafeed, to the Pathway Data
Warehouse/MIS system.

From the measurements it is estimated that the time to transfer the
files to MIS using FDDI/100Mb Ethernet will take less than 45
minutes. However, most of the file transfer time is overlapped with the
TPS processing that generates the files, as each file is available to be
transferred to TIP as soon as it is closed by TPS. The Data
Warehouse schedule requires that the files should be available on
the Data Warehouse by 00:30, but the NR2 Host processing model
[MOD024] predicts that they will normally be available before 23:00.

The results of the tests showed that the most efficient way of running
the MIS file transfer is to run one transfer at a time and not to try
running multiple concurrent file transfers.

3.9 INTERACTIVE SERVICES

3.9.1

3.9.2

Summary

The tests conducted for the Interactive Services indicate that the
system is capable of supporting the expected volumes that will occur
on the busiest day at full rollout. Most of the load from the interactive
services occurs during the ‘on-line day’ when the Host system is
comparatively lightly loaded. The additional load generated by the
interactive services on the Host in comparatively low.

It was therefore decided that the three key areas (see below) should
be measured but not modelled.

Performance Assessment

Section 7 of [Requirements] specifies the agreed set of tests. These
consist of:

8.1 OBCS ‘Foreign’ Transactions

8.2 PAS/CMS Helpdesk

8.3 CAPS On-Line

3.9.2.1 Test 7.1- OBCS ‘Foreign’ Transactions

Test 7.1 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results
of the tests are reported in [REP041].

The calculation of the number of OBCS ‘foreign’ transactions is
dominated by the rate at which outlets are rolled out as the first
time a book is presented at a newly automated outlet a ‘foreign’
transaction is initiated. This has the effect of ‘registering’ the book
at that outlet and the outlet as the ‘home’ outlet for the NINO.

An engineering model produced to evaluate the NR2 design
identified the need for greater throughput from the OBCS Agent in
order to handle the heavy OBCS ‘foreign’ workload, and in
particular the load generated by the automating of outlets. This
model identified that the OBCS Foreign Agents were not capable
of supporting the required peak OBCS ‘foreign’ throughput. To
ensure that the system can deliver the throughput and
responsiveness a revised design has been implemented at New
Release 2 that introduces multi-threading OBCS foreign agents
(see CP1118).

During the busiest week during the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets,
on average 12 of OBCS ‘foreigns’ per second will be processed
during the peak hour. The performance of OBCS ‘foreigns’ has
been tested up to 18 per second per agent on one
Correspondence Server. The response time for transactions
entering the Correspondence Server through the campus 100Mb
LAN was well below half a second. However, due to a limitation in
the testing methods it was not possible to measure the response
time at the Gateway PC i.e. including ISDN connection, catch-up
and ISDN transmission times.

The 20-Counter evaluation test has measured the end-to-end cost
of OBCS ‘foreign’ transactions on 20 counter Post Office running
the peak on peak workload i.e. Christmas 2000. The mean
response time for OBCS ‘foreign’ transactions (Scan OBCS Bar
Code) at a counter is 3.3 seconds, including the gateway
connection time and the ISDN delay.

The SLA states that the time taken for OBCS foreign transactions,
(normal and fallback times) must not exceed an average of 28.1
secs, measured monthly over all outlets. The response time
measured above is part of the overall figure.

The performance of BES ‘foreign’ transactions will be measured
during a later phase of Performance Testing. However, the 20-
Counter evaluation test has measured the mean response time for
BES ‘foreign’ transactions (Swipe BES Magnetic Card) at 3.1
seconds.

This test also forms part of Test 3.7 (see §3.5.2.7).
3.9.2.2 Test 7.2 - PAS/CMS Help Desk

Test 7.2 was run as a joint test between the Performance Test
team and the ORACLE PAS/CMS development team as part of the
testing for Release 1c. The results of the tests are reported on in
[REP035].

The Help Desk response times (at the 95" Percentile) were all sub-
second for 400 users, using 15% of the Host CPU resources.

A Release 1c Help Desk client has a smaller foot print compared to
a Release NR2 client, but on the Host Server side the same type of
package functions/procedures are being used with added code.
Between Release 1c and Release NR2 the Oracle core
architecture (e.g. SQL*NET) did not change other than
upgraded/patches, this means that the same type of messages are
being passed between the client and server. The measurements
taken at 1c are representative of the performance expected at

3.9.2.3 CAPS On-Line

CAPS On-Line testing was performed as part of the CAPS Joint
Interface project. The results of the tests are reported on in
[REP041].

The Performance Test team and an ITSA team lead by John
Stokoe jointly produced the testing plan and the test was
constructed as a joint exercise. The ITSA team provided the VME
components of the test and the message generator and the
Performance Test team the Pathway PAS/CMS Host environment.

The maximum throughput at full rollout volumes is not expected to
exceed 2 TP transactions per second. However to ensure that the
end-to-end system could support higher throughput, if required,
testing was performed up to 10 messages per second.

Up to 2 TP transactions per second, 99% of transactions had
response times that were better than 3 seconds. The SLA states
that > or = 95% of all on-line transactions have a < or = 3 seconds
response time.

The 10 messages per second test was a functional test and not a
performance test, so there was no response time target.

The performance of CAPS On-Line has been measured but not
modelled.

The time to perform the daily ‘hot backup’ from the EMC? discs to
the Sequent Host discs is approximately 75 minutes.

The ‘hot backup’ is performed at the end of the overnight schedule.
On the heaviest night during the rollout of the first 8,000 outlets,
the ‘hot backup’ will finish before 06:00.

3.10.2.2 Correspondence Server Message Auditing

Test 8.2 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results
of the tests are reported in [REP043].

At NR2, all messages written to the Riposte Message Store are
captured by the Audit Agent and written to an intermediate file on
the Correspondence Server. This process is called ‘harvesting the
audit tracks’. This process takes place concurrently with other
Riposte processes. Each intermediate file will hold 100,000
messages. When the limit on the number of messages has been
reached a new file is opened and the previous file can be
transferred to tape on the Audit Server. This process is called
‘gathering the audit track’.

3.11 ISDN NETWORK

3.11.1

3.11.2

Summary

The Pathway ISDN network was modelled early in the design
process. At the time the model showed that the network could support
the full rollout volumes predicted. The latest engineering model
predicts that the current ISDN network will support 4,000 outlets [°]
with sufficient headroom for contingency.

What has changed? During this time the understanding of the
network traffic generated by the workload has increased and this has
had the effect of significantly increasing the number of datagrams the
network has to support at peak times. At the same time the
requirement to store network addresses in the ISDN Routers has
increased dramatically in order to support the Tivoli systems
management infrastructure and the performance of the ISDN routers
in handling connections is a function of the size of the network
address tables.

Pathway has put in place a major development plan to ensure that the
ISDN network can deliver well in excess of the demand at any stage
in the rollout programme. The first phase of the development is to
increase the power of the ISDN routers by upgrading the processing
unit. These developments will increase the safe limit of outlets that
can be connected to 10,000 and will be intercepted by the end of live
trial.

The ISDN network will support 20,000 outlets with the VPN
developments at NR2*.

Performance Assessment

No specific performance measurement of the ISDN network has been
done except to support the modelling.

It is intended that during live trial, the live trial Post Offices are used
in a “test mode” to stress the ISDN network. This will allow the ISDN
network to be loaded to a level higher than that expected at 20,000
outlets.

© The number of outlets that can be supported and which is stated in this section conforms
to the headroom model described in the Scaleability Report [Scaleability]. It is not the
maximum number of outlets that could be supported.

The proposal is to run a test of the ISDN links using the Live Trial
system using a purpose written application that sits on the Gateway
PC of each outlet in live trial. This application would be distributed to
each of the Live Trial outlets prior to the test using the standard
Pathway software distribution processes & procedures. The test
would be initiated automatically. At a given time (e.g. on a Sunday) all
300 outlets phone the data centre.

As the clocks on the Gateways are synchronised, all 300 phone calls
should arrive at the data centres together. The impact on e.g. the
network routers and the load on the systems components can be
measured. The call rate that would be generated by this test is higher
than is expected from 20K outlets.

Extensive modelling using engineering models has been done of the
ISDN network. This shows that the current ISDN routers can safely
support 4,000 outlets. An upgrade to the router processors allows the
current routers to support the rollout up to 10,000 outlets. This
change has been committed in CP1807 for interception during live
trial.

Pathway is investing in the development of the ISDN engineering
models over the coming months. A sizing and modelling specialist,
John Sewart, has joined the Pathway Performance Team to
undertake this work.

The adoption of VPN in New Release 2* will allow the current ISDN
network to support 20,000 outlets. The programme of network
modelling work will be extended to include VPN.

3.12 DATA CENTRE NETWORK

3.12.1 Summary

Early design work showed that the data centre network should not be
a performance issue and that the busiest LAN segment [’] would be
the one into the Correspondence Servers during the peak hour of the
day.

Performance testing has shown that at 8,000 outlets this segment will
be only 5% utilised.

3.12.2 Performance Assessment

There were no specific performance tests of the data centre network.
Instead all performance tests report the network utilisation as part of
the standard report.

The key report is [REP043] that tested Counter to Correspondence
Server replication. During this test the maximum network utilisation
was 17% at a message replication rate of 3.5 times that expected at
8,000 outlets. The test only had a single LAN connection to the
Correspondence Server (simulating a failure on one of the LANs) and
included the network load due to the Audit Server.

The data centre network has been tested at NR2 and the results used
in the models.

7 The site LAN is not a shared LAN. Each component is connected to a Gigabit switch across
a point-to-point 100Mbit LAN. This architecture avoids collisions and permits each segment
to operate at higher utilisations that a shared LAN.

3.13 WAN LINKS

3.13.1. Summary

The inter-site WAN link uses two 34Mbit E3_ point-to-point
connections. A separate 34Mbps E3 link is used for the Symmetrix
disc mirroring system (SRDF) on the SE70 Hosts.

Performance testing has shown that at 8,000 outlets the inter-site
WAN link will be 30% utilised [°]. This utilisation assumes that one of
the two WAN links has failed.

3.13.2 Performance Assessment

There were no specific performance tests of the WAN link. Instead all
performance tests report the network utilisation as part of the
standard report. This allows the WAN link utilisation to be calculated.

The key report is [REP043] that tested Counter to Correspondence
Server replication. During this test the maximum network utilisation on
the LAN due to message replication was 7.5% at a replication rate of
5 times that expected at 8,000 outlets. This gives an expected
network utilisation at 8,000 outlets of 1.5%.

The WAN link has 20% of the bandwidth of a LAN segment and has
to handle the message replication traffic of 4 correspondence server
clusters. This gives an expected utilisation of 30%. This assumes that
only one of the WAN links is working.

The inter-site WAN network has been tested at NR2 and the results
used in the models.

This gives an expected network utilisation at 8,000 outlets of 5%. For
modelling purposes default scalebility plan will be invoked before the
utilisation reaches 20% unless the CSP refines the default position.

® For point-to-point networks, utilisations up to 60% can be sustained.

3.14 DATA WAREHOUSE & MIS SYSTEMS

3.14.1 Summary
The performance of the Pathway Data Warehouse was tested in a
joint project between the Data Warehouse architecture & design
teams and OSD. This extensive project measured a full cycle of the
Data Warehouse including end-of-week and end-of-month processing
against the heaviest volumes which will be generated by 10,000
outlets. The results of the performance tests are recorded in Data
Warehouse Technical Test Report [DW014].
Testing of the Data Warehouse is limited by the disc configuration on
the Data Warehouse. The current disc configuration will support 55%
of the predicted data volumes. Pathway has plans in place to upgrade
the EMC? disc configuration on the Data Warehouse when required.
The performance tests demonstrated that the NR2 data volumes can
be processed in the target window i.e. 00:30 to 05:30.
3.14.2 Performance Assessment
Testing of the Data Warehouse was divided into the four main
phases:
Phase Range of pre- Comments/Reason
populated data
Phase 1-Upload I 0 days No prior data is required since the upload
phase takes place in daily partitioned tables.
Phase 2 - Daily 0 days No prior data is required since the daily
consolidation phase predominately consolidates
data into daily and weekly partitioned tables
Phase 3- Weekly I 6 days in current I The weekly consolidation rolls up data from the
week current week; thus 6 previous days in the
current week are required to give a
representative time.
Phase 3- Monthly I 6 weeks of data in I The monthly consolidations select from up to 6
which the current weekly partitions.

Performance models have been constructed for each of the 4 phases,
and are summarised as follows:

Phase 1 can be assumed to be near-linear (slightly worse) with an
increase of 26 minutes for every 5,000 automated post offices that
are rolled out. This allows us to predict the NR2* performance time
to be 77+ 2 x 26 = 129 minutes (where 77 minutes is the time for
the first 10,000 post offices rolled out).

Phase 2 is a linear model showing an increase of 4 minute in
performance time for every 5,000 automated post offices rolled out.
Thus the NR2* times can be computed as 22 + 2 x 4 = 30 minutes
(where 22 minutes is the time for the first 10,000 post offices rolled
out).

The normal daily operations in Phase 3 are constant over time, and
independent of the number of post offices rolled-out.

The end-of-week part of Phase 3 is well modelled by a linear
relationship with an increase of 13 minutes per rollout of 5,000
automated post offices. The prediction for NR2* (20,000 post
offices) performance time is 38+ 2 x 13 = 64 minutes.

The end-of-month part of Phase 3 can be approximated by kN*
model (x = 1.44 & k = 0.000099). Using this model the performance
time for 20,000 post offices is 154 minutes. The end-of-month at full-
load is expected to be worse than the measured figure by a factor
of approximately 2.5.

Phase 4 is defined by a linear function of the number of post offices
rolled-out. It is estimated that the performance time will increase by
151 minutes for every 5,000 automated post offices rolled out.

3.15 ROLLOUT BEAT RATE

3.15.1 Summary
The rollout model assumes that for Post Office rollout:

° National Rollout starts on 5" April 1999.

° The rollout rate in the first 6 weeks of National Rollout is 100,
100, 150, 150, 200 and 250 Post Offices respectively.

° The rollout is then 300 Post Offices per week until 22°
November 1999.

. Over the 7 week Christmas period the rollout is 150, 150, 150, 0,
0, 0, and 150 Post Offices respectively.

The rollout is then 300 Post Offices per week all Post Offices are
rolled out.

All of the NR2 models use the workload Volume Model defined in
[MOD026].

3.15.2 Performance Assessment

The rollout rate has a direct impact on many aspects of the system,
including:

° The peak number of OBCS ‘foreigns’

° The number of objects processed by the Reference Data Bulk
Loader

as well as the more obvious measures like the number of calls across
the ISDN network.

The workload model uses the expected case defined above to
generate the workload volumes to ensure that the testing and
modelling always uses the heaviest load that could be generated at
any point during the rollout programme.

3.16 VECTOR SERVERS

3.16.1

3.16.2

Summary

Performance testing of the Vector Servers was undertaken at
Release 1c and the results of these tests showed that the Vector
Servers can support the workload up to full rollout.

Each BPS payment authorisation requires the Vector Server to issue
a security vector or digital signature. The Vector Server has 10 million
previously generated vectors.

Performance Assessment

Testing of the Vector servers formed part of the BPS Payment
Authorisation bulk loader test (see §3.5.2.5). This test has
demonstrated that 8 Vector Servers can generate the keys required
by the BPS Payment Authorisation Bulk Loader agent on a peak on
peak day in less than 6 hours. With both sites in operation this figure
would be halved.

During the generation of vectors the CPU utilisation of the Vector
server is 100%. However, this can run concurrently with the supply of
vectors as this process uses very little Vector server resources and
the supply is not effected by the vector generation process.

3.17 AUDIT SERVER

3.17.1

3.17.2

Summary

The performance testing and modelling of the Audit Server has
focussed on the transfer of message data from the Correspondence
Server to the Audit Server for long-term archiving. The messages are
captured (‘harvested’) by an Audit Agent running on the
Correspondence Server and stored in files on the Correspondence
Server. The files of information are transferred (‘gathered’) by the
Audit Server from the Correspondence Server using NFS.

Performance Assessment

Test 8.2 was performed by the Performance Test team. The results of
the test are reported in [REP043].

The first part of the test was to re-run the counter to Correspondence
Server message replication test previously reported on as part of Test
3.1 and 3.4 (see §3.5.2.4 for further details) using an enhanced
version of the counter simulator to provide the most accurate
representation of the load generated on the Correspondence Server
by replication.

During the peak on peak hour at full rollout volumes the configuration
used in the tests [°] could not support the replication from the
counters and the Audit Agent operating concurrently. The maximum
rate at which messages were replicated was reduced by 17% when
the Audit Agent was run concurrently with replication.

The current configuration can support the heaviest workload
generated during the rollout to 8,000 outlets. The load generated by
NR2 has been tested in test 3.7 (see §3.5.2.7) when the Audit Agent
was run concurrently with Riposte replication. At these volumes, no
impact on the rate of replication was observed.

An analysis of the results from the peak on peak case indicates the
problem is entirely due to the load on the CPU as the
Correspondence Server is almost 100% utilised by replication only.
Pathway has already taken steps to enhance the configuration of the
Correspondence Server processor in-line with the Scaleability
Strategy for Correspondence Servers [Scaleability]. and the I/O
subsystem The 4-way COMPAQ servers with Intel Xeon processors
will be included in future performance test plans.

° The Correspondence Server was a 4-way 200MHz Pentium Pro system with COMPAQ
SCSI Disc Arrays

ICL Pathway PERFORMANCE SUMMARY REPORT Ree BOPERIOI®

FOR NR2 Date 07/06/99

During the development of the Audit Server architecture, a number of
engineering models were constructed to assist with the sizing of:

° intermediate disc storage required on the Correspondence
Server before the files are transferred to the Audit Server

° the communications link between the Correspondence Server
and the Audit Server

° the tape sub-system on the Audit Server.

The output from these models was incorporated in the Audit Server
architecture. The models do not form part of the formal model set as
the performance testing described above is sufficient to provide
Pathway with data to confirm that the interface is performant.
