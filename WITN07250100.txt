Helpdesk as a Horizon System Helpdesk Advisor (HSD) from May 2000. Taking

Incident Team still within the Horizon Helpdesk for which my task was checking
the correct information was in calls from frontline agents with regard to
software/hardware, so that the call could then be reassigned to the correct route
for investigation. Hardware calls would be reassigned to engineering team for
engineers to attend to check or replace the part of equipment. Software calls
would be reassigned to the software team ensuring any error messages or error
codes were logged in the call. | can’t recall any specific error messages but we
had KELs (known error log) documents to follow. After a period of time | held
