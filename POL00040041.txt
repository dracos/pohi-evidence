Hugh/Rodric

As per my discussions with Rodric today, please find attached Brian Altman's review. This is the backward looking review
(effectively reviewing the CK review) and should give comfort to POL.

The full review is 55 pages long but there is an executive summary at pages 5 to 7.

I will send an email tomorrow giving a little more context but wanted to get the report over today in accordance with
Brian's terms of reference.

I'm happy to field any queries on my blackberry as I'm out of the office tomorrow.

Kind regards

Gavin
