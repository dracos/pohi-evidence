That's fine; I look forward to seeing you then.

I think it would be perfect unless the defence statement were to be delayed by another statement.
Could we say that if that does not happen we should meet at 5, but if it does, we should meet at 6?

How about meeting in my room (Portcullis House, 491, corner room on 4th floor, overlooking
Thames and Big Ben)?

Many thanks.

1am in meetings until about 4.30. Would about 5.00 pm be suitable?

David,

Many thanks for allowing me to come to the meeting on Thursday. I met some ex-sub Postmasters
on Friday and would welcome a chat any time after the defence statement this afternoon. Might
you be free at all?

I feel a campaign coming on.
