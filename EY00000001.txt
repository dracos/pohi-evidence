>> We auited the POMS impaiment model as part of our testing ofthe POMS good for

which our concisions ae included in ourecutsreportissued on 14 May 2018. We noted

that there is significant headroom of£53m compared to POMS asets of 52m, wich
inclue goodwill of £44, Hence the focus of our testing has been onthe POL CGU which
has  hesdroom of €240m and assets of £362m of wich other long-lived assets are
361m.

We noted that POL has use forecast peti of 3 yearfor the pupose ofits impainent

testing We concur that his isin ine with the requirements of1AS 36 which allows 8

forecast period of upto 5 years.

We chatlenged the accuracy of management's cash flow forecasting by comparing the

actual esi for 2017/18 against budget aswel as by taking the actual performance for

the fst 2 months of 2018/19 and extrapolating forthe fullthe year and comparing to
budget. Based on this we note that POL is conservative in t's budgeting process and that
actual pefonnance i better than budget. As an example POL budgeted EBITDA of £280 for

2017/8 with actual EBITDA of £26 which i sinifcant higher.

We engaged our valuations experts to assist with the assessment the discount ate (9%)
and ong term growth rate (0%) applied othe made. Based on this we concude that the
iscount rate of 9% islower than the recommended range of 8.99 - 13.8% proved by our
valuations expert. However, ven significant headroom of £240 for 2017/18 this wil not
have amateial impact.
