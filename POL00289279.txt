RE: Post Office: GLO - strictly privileged and confidential - settlement authority
20191122 Shareholder Approval for POL Settlement Range November Mediation_V2 BW.docx

As Tom mentioned below we are hoping to provide written confirmation of authority soon and attach a draft of the
proposed letter. You will see that we want to put a time limit on the authority but not in a way that might have
unintended consequences for any Part 36 offers should this weeks mediation not be successful.

The terms of Al Cameron’s letter about POL’s ability to fund any settlement should have confirmed that POL’s ability
to fund would not require any changes to existing funding agreed for the period up to March 2021 — so we have
included something around this.

Do let us know if anything in this proposed draft causes a problem.

We shall be in touch about practicalities for any further settlement approval above £48m. You will see that the figure
must ensure final settlement of the litigation and must be approved by POL’s Chair and CEO before we consider it.

Happy to discuss
Kind regards

Richard

Let’s speak on Monday.

We're planning to write to confirm approval once we’re in a position to do so. The letter will also set out who to
contact if a further decision is required.

No need to disturb your coaching. I hope you’re preparing the kids to World Cup winning standard. We can use the
help.

Tom & Tom,
lam sorry about the outcome of the permission application, but at least we now know where we stand.

With the upcoming mediation in mind, I wanted to be clear on our authorities. My understanding is
that:

1. BEIS is supportive of Post Office making offers up to £50m (on the basis that Post Office
obviously wants BEIS on board with its general strategy); and

2. Weare able to contact you to get authority to go up to £65m on the day of the mediation if we
think it is desirable to do so.

Could you let me know if that also reflects your understanding. If so, are there any particular
arrangements you would like put in place to enable us to contact you on Wednesday or (more likely)
Thursday — potentially quite late into the evening.

We are obviously happy to keep you updated on the progress of the mediation. I had in mind emailing
you regular updates on the state of play, but let me know if you would like us to play things differently.

Happy to discuss, if that would be helpful. My mobile number if you'd like to reach me
over the weekend. I should probably confess I am on the rugby pitch on both Saturday and Sunday
mornings (U8 coach, for my sins) but should otherwise be available at any time.

Kind regards
Kate
