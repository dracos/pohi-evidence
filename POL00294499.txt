POST OFFICE LTD - CASE REVIEW

R-v- VALERY ROSE JAMES
Crown Court sitting at Kingston-upon-Thames

PRE-HORIZON ON-LINE CASE

Offence and Case History

1. On the 20" October 2009 at the Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court
before HHJ Dodgson, this defendant was sentenced to 9 months
imprisonment suspended for 24 months. She also received a supervision
requirement of 12 months. She was charged with Theft of £90,418.90
belonging to Post Office Ltd between the 22"! May 2007 and the 10" July
2008.

2. On 19 February 2010 Recorder H de Silva QC made an agreed
confiscation order in favour of Post Office Limited in the sum of
£49,206.20, with 6 months to pay and 18 months imprisonment in default

of payment.

3. The defendant was born on the 8" April 1953 and was aged 55. She was
arrested and charged with Theft between the above dates of £48,211.90
(this amount appears only to have been amended to £90,418.90 shortly
before or on the date of trial) and appeared at South Western Magistrates
Court on 22™ January 2009. A judge had made a restraint order on 24%
July 2008. The magistrates refused jurisdiction and committal took place

on 18" March 2009.

4. She pleaded not guilty at her Plea and Case Management Hearing on 29"
April 2009 and the case was put in a warned list for the 14 September
2009. It was listed for trial on the 15"" September and on that date the
defendant pleaded guilty to an amended indictment of Theft of
POL00294499
POL00294499

£90,418.90. She submitted a basis of plea which was not accepted by the

prosecution.

5. In that basis she accepted taking more than £90,000 and entered false
figures into HORIZON to cover this. She admitted putting the money into
her personal locker but did not accept taking any money out of the
premises. She did not know how considerably less than £90,000 was
found in her locker, but accepted that her benefit for confiscation was
£48,111.90. The confiscation figure of £49,206.80 was arrived at as the
Financial Investigation Officer took into account the RPI increase in the

value of money of £1,201.80.

Prosecution case

6. The defendant had been employed by the Post Office since 1992, initially
at Eltham, and then at Houndsditch Crown Office where she was
employed as a post office assistant. Houndsditch was an open plan office
with each person having a roller cash dispenser (a secure till which
releases cash through a number of slots on a timed basis). There is also a
small drop safe where large amounts of cash can be securely stored
during business hours. On 9" July 2008 the Branch Manager was
contacted and informed that the cash holdings were too high. He looked
at individual stock units and found that whilst the majority of the clerks
were holding between £2 - 5,000 the defendant was holding in excess of
£90,000.

7. The defendant was approached and she admitted that not all the cash
would be present and that a quantity was in her personal locker. A post
office carrier bag was found there in which a black plastic sack containing
about £42,300 was found, bundled up in £1,000 and £500 bundles. This
still left a cash deficit in her till of over £48,000. Due to the amount the

police were notified and she was arrested on 9" July.

8. The defendant was interviewed under caution on 9" July 2008 and 1°

September 2008. She said as follows:

- She had been declaring inflated cash on hand figures on her counter
till balance for about a year.

- She had put the cash in her personal locker as she did not have enough
storage room in her till and she did not like transferring cash to the
Branch Manager in an open plan office;

- She denied stealing any money.

Defence case

9. The defendant pleaded not guilty at her plea and case management
hearing and submitted a defence case statement. She said in the statement
that she had asked for redundancy as she has a disabled adult son and
wanted to be made redundant so that she could claim benefits for his
care. This was refused and she found the job stressful. She said she had
little training provided. She said that she stored the cash and did not
balance the accounts in the hope that she could be discovered and

dismissed. She was living in penury.

10.When the case was listed for trial on the 15" September 2009 she
changed her plea to guilty of Theft of £90,418.90 but submitted a basis of
plea as outlined in paragraph 2 above. She accepted by her plea of guilty
stealing in excess of £90,000. She accepted the benefit derived from

criminal conduct to be £48,111.90.

Discussion

11. The defendant had always accepted that she had transferred money to her
personal locker, although she claimed that she did not know it was as
high as in excess of £90,000. Her home address, living circumstances and
financial investigations do not show any prima facie evidence of living
above her means. Examination of her bank accounts were done and there
is no indication on the papers that cash was entering or leaving that
account. Her house was mortgaged and the mortgagees had applied for a
charging order of £11,302.62 on 8" December 2009. In real terms if there
was ever any dispute as to the audit printout from the HORIZON system
this would have been flagged up at an early stage and certainly prior to
trial. However, in this case I have seen the following:

(1) When the case was being prepared for trial defence solicitors and
counsel visited the post office merely to take sketches and
photographs of the layout of the premises, and did not raise any
questions about the workings of the accounting system;

(2) A letter from Nelson Guest and Partners, the defendant’s solicitors,
dated 1‘ May 2009 in which they state “We do not require Christine
Stevens to attend to give evidence and you may therefore accept that
we do not propose that the amount of money should be subject to
audit”;

(3) The basis of plea in which the defendant accepts taking in excess of
£90,000;

(4) A further letter from Nelson Guest dated 10° February 2010 in
relation to the confiscation proceedings in which they state “We don’t
understand the letter. We don’t dispute this confiscation, we don’t

dispute the loss .... What is there not to agree? Please explain”.

Conclusion

12. This defendant pleaded guilty to theft on a written basis that specifically
admitted taking more than £90,000. As she was given a suspended
sentence it is plain that the Judge was faithful to that basis. It is difficult to
see how any disclosure of the issues contained in the Second Sight Interim
Report could possibly found any realistic appeal against conviction or

sentence. No further disclosure required.
