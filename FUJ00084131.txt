OCP 21918 Completed

Insert corrective transactions at branch 382137

A set of unbalanced SC currency transactions were written in error at branch 382137 on 18th Feb. A set of
equal but opposite transactions is to be inserted to undo the effects.

Justification: Enables the branch to balance correctly, and data in POL FS will also be correct.
When: Planned for 03/03/2009 09:30 with a duration of 10 mins

Extra detail: Tested within SSC and proved to generate a further R&P mismatch which negates the first,
and also a gain to negate the loss of just under £1000 caused by the problem and currently outstanding at
the branch. The gain may not be precisely the same as the original loss because of variations in the
exchange rates.

POL (Julie Edgeley) have already agreed to the change, in an email attached to PC0175821.

Regression: This change cannot be regressed.

Anne,

As discussed, POL are happy for you to make the necessary system adjustments.

From speaking to Wendy, the manager in the branch, first thing on Tuesday morning (between 9am and
10am) is the quietest time for them.

Ihave advised Wendy that you will call her as you are about to start and as you finish.

Thank you
