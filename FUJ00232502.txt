1 Introduction

Fujitsu Services’s Data Warehouse (DWh) will be used to provide all Management
Information reports. These are characterised by the use to which they are put and the
timeliness in which they need to be produced. A management information report is used to
inform strategic decision making rather than day-to-day operational decisions. Usually the
reports are produced some time after the fact and report on events that took place over a
period of days, weeks and months, or even years, rather than hours.

2 Requirements

These reports do not support contractual service levels but are provided for the use of POL to
support the management of their business. This is a new service to POL.

Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 12/07/2002

Four Trend Analysis reports are required:
¢ Money Laundering

¢ Multiple Transactions

e Transaction Outcome by Outlet

e Bank Analysis

3 Method of Distribution

Pathway's Management Support Unit will refresh each report shortly after the period covered
by the report has ended. This will create a new Business Objects report file for each report.
These files will be made available to Post Office Limited , for example by CD-ROM or by
placing them on a server to which they have access. The method of delivery will be specified
in Delivery Procedure for Network Banking MIS Reports (CS/PRD/109) [OPS].

Once a week the new Business Objects report files for the Transaction Outcome by Outlet and
Bank Analysis will be delivered to POL.

Once a month the new Business Objects report files for the Money Laundering and Multiple
Transactions will be delivered to POL:

The Bank Analysis report will normally be delivered to POL on the working day following the
end of the reporting period. Other reports will normally be delivered to POL within five
working days after the end of the reporting period.

Post Office Limited will need to provide one or more Windows NT Workstations running
BusinessObjects 5.1 to view, print and manipulate the reports provided.

4 Design

This section describes the format and content of the Network Banking MIS reports as they
will be delivered. It also shows some examples of how the reports can be customised by the
user to meet his or her own individual requirements.

This document follows BusinessObjects convention of considering attributes of objects as
either Dimensions or Measures. Dimensions are attributes by which it is possible to specify
what is being reported. They determine things like What happened, When something
happened, Where something happened. It is not normal to perform arithmetic on dimensions.
Measures are quantitive attributes like how many or how much. Arithmetic is routinely
performed on Measures.

4.1 Principles

The following conventions will be applied to all reports unless there is a specific requirement
otherwise. Reports will:

e Cover a single instance of a period of time defined in either the Calendar or Accounting
Calendar hierarchies.

Be delivered as Business Objects report files.
Use Arial font sized at 10 point or above.
Be able to be printed full width on normal A4 paper either landscape or portrait.

without truncation or text wrapping.
e Have a repeating page header that contains the report title, date last refreshed, the period
of time covered, and any text required to show the values of any selection criteria used.
© Where the scope of a report is a Month the page header will display the Month Name
and Year in a single field. e.g. August 2001.
© Where the scope of a report is an Accounting Week the page header will display
Accounting Week ID, Accounting Period Id, and Financial Year in a single field
separated by" /". e.g. "4/5/2000" which represents the fourth Accounting Week in
the Fifth Accounting Period in the Financial Year that began in Year 2000.
e Have a repeating page footer that contains page number in Page n of nn format.
© Object descriptions or names are displayed in preference to codes. N.B. The data
providers must include codes so that they are available to users.
e Dates are displayed in DD-Mmm-YY format, left justified.

seconds and milliseconds.
e Currency amounts are displayed in £4,##0.00 format, right justified.
e Transaction volumes are displayed in #,##0 format, right justified.

4.2 Dates

Requirements have been identified to use four dates:

¢ Receipt Date - Calendar Date (and Local Time) when the transaction was recorded.
Receipt Date will be used for any reports where the details of individual transactions are
required.

e Trading Date - Identifies Trading Day. This is the unit by which the Transaction
Processing Service packages transactions for delivery to both TIP and the Data
Warehouse. The Data Warehouse will maintain aggregates with Trading Day granularity
and this will be the default unit of aggregation for all MIS reports.

e Settlement Date - The requirement for the Bank Analysis report explicitly states that
Settlement Date, which is determined by the Authorising Source, is to be used. This
attribute will be included in the data passed from TPS to DWh.

¢ Posting Date - This is the date that transactions were posted to the Data Warehouse. It is
the date of the 7rading Day that ended immediately prior to the transactions being
harvested by TPS for delivery to TIP.

4.3 Hierarchies

Business Objects is a powerful user tool for manipulating data. A full description of the
facilities it provides is beyond the scope of this document. Some features however depend on

the end users use of them being anticipated and catered for by the designer. This is
particularly true when considering the different levels of detail, or abstraction, that a user
might require. There are two basic ways to do this:

Drilling: This is where the user is interested in looking in more detail at a subset of data from
areport. e.g. A user looking at a report showing volumes of transactions by Bank and wishes
to see how a Bank's transactions are distributed by the Bank's Issuer Schemes. By selecting
the 'Drill' control, the Bank Dimension, and the ‘drill down' option a new version of the report
is displayed showing only the selected Bank's transactions broken down by it's /ssuer Schemes.
Both the scope and the level of abstraction of the report are changed. This facility depends on
hierarchies being defined and made available in reports.

Dimension Swapping: This is where a user is interested at looking at a report at a different
level of abstraction. e.g. A user is looking at a report showing the volume of Network
Banking Transactions by Territory and wishes to look at the same data by Head of Area. By
‘dragging’ the Head of Area dimension from the Report Manager section of the report and
‘dropping’ it over the 'Territory' dimension in the report body these dimensions are swapped.
The report will change to show the volume of Network Banking Transactions by Head of
Area. Changing the dimensions used in a report only changes the level of abstraction and
cannot be used to change the scope.

Business Objects is a complex tool and it is possible to manipulate reports in many ways. It is
not possible make reports foolproof without removing all the flexibility available. Drilling up
and down predefined hierarchies, and swapping a reported dimension for another in the same
hierarchy, will be supported.

To support this a number hierarchies have been defined for Network Banking MIS reports. It
should be noted that while hierarchies can add greatly to the usefulness of Business Objects
reports they are not cost free. The cost comes in three forms 1) The length of time it takes to
regenerate reports increases, 2) The size of delivered files increases, 3)The time taken to
display the results of changes made to the report by the user increases, reducing its
responsiveness. If it is found that any of these is unacceptable in use then consideration should
be given to reducing the use of hierarchies.

The convention used in this document for defining hierarchies is top (or most abstract, least
detail) to bottom (or least abstract, most detail). Unless restricted by the scope of the report
the user will be allowed to navigate both up and down hierarchies.

The following hierarchies are defined:

4.4 Report Design

The design of each report will be expressed in terms of the entities and attributes in [DAT].
For convenience brief descriptions of the entities and attributes employed are reproduced in
Section 0.4 Abbreviations and Definitions.

4.4.1 Money Laundering

This monthly report shows the details, by Outlet, of cash deposit transactions that exceed a
configurable threshold. The report will display successful Network Banking transactions
where the Product Type is 'Cash Deposit’ and the Confirmed Amount is greater than Money
Laundering Threshold . Money Laundering Threshold is an amount, held in Fujitsu Services
reference data within the Data Warehouse, that constrains the volume of data included in the
report. The value of Money Laundering Threshold will be set to £10000. This value can be
changed at POLs instigation using the established Change Request process. The standard

Business Objects filter function can be employed by the user to restrict the transactions
displayed to any value greater than Money Laundering Threshold.

Details of each individual Transaction where the threshold is exceeded will be displayed
together with an Outlet summary that shows the volume of transactions and sum of Confirmed
Amounts.

No hierarchies are used in this report.

Rules:

1. The transaction was successful (7ransaction.Success = true).

2. Product Type is 'Cash Deposit’.

3. Receipt Date between Month.Start Date and Month.End Date.

4. Confirmed Amount is greater than Money Laundering Threshold.

4.4.2 Multiple Transactions

This monthly report shows details of where more than a configurable number of transactions
has been conducted, within an Outlet, for the same PAN in a Trading Day. [R269] Multiple
Transaction Threshold is an value, held in Fujitsu Services reference data within the Data
Warehouse, that constrains the volume of data included in the report. The value of Multiple
Transaction Threshold will be initially set to 5 (five). This value can be changed at POLs
instigation using the established Change Request process.

Details of each individual transaction will be shown, sorted by Outlet, PAN, and Receipt Date.

This weekly report [R258] shows a summary of the Network Banking transactions performed
in each Outlet. The scope of this report will be an Accounting Week.

For each Outlet there will be one row, showing Transaction Volume and Transaction Value,
for each combination of Product and Outcome. The sort sequence for this report will be
ascending FAD Code, Product and Outcome. Page breaks will be inserted to ensure that each
Outlet starts on a new page.

4.4.4 Bank Analysis

A weekly report showing, for each Bank, the daily count and sum of Confirmed Amount of
Network Banking transactions. [R261].

Each page will, in addition to the standard page header items, show the date of latest Trading
Date posted by the Data Warehouse at the time the report was produced (or refreshed). This
is included to indicate to the user that the Data Warehouse had posted transactions for each
Trading Date within the Accounting Week.

The scope of this report a week will be an Accounting Week. A single report will be produced
each week containing all Banks.

Each Bank will start on a new page, and within Bank there will be separate sections for each
Issuer Scheme.

Within /ssuer Scheme there will be one row for each combination of Posting Date, Settlement
Date, Product Type Value Band and Transaction Result recorded during the reporting period.

The sort sequence for the report will ascending Bank, Issuer Scheme, Posting Date,
Settlement Date, Product Type Value Band and Transaction Result.

N.B. Value Bands and the Product Types that they apply to are soft configured. The initial
configuration will be that specified in "Codified Agreement Schedule N05 - Service
Management" [NOS], section 6.1.2. i.e. For each of the Product Types “Cash Withdrawal”,
“Cash Withdrawal with Balance” and “Cash Deposit” there shall be three value bands. The
three value bands will be: (i) zero value transactions; (ii) transactions of greater than zero that
are less than or equal to £250; and (iii) greater than £250.

Rules:
1. Posting Date between Accounting Week.Start Date and Accounting Week.End Date.
