Tom

Thanks for the comments. I've set out below a few explanations for the approach taken on some of your comments.

We've (including Rodric — cc'd) taken an intentional decision to refer to Crown branches rather than Directly Managed
branches because this mirrors the wording in the GPOC. We considered trying to change terminology but decided it
could become confusing if we refer to DMBs through the litigation and Freeths refer to Crowns. A judge would just get
irritated by this and would likely end up using "Crown" because its shorter to say! I appreciate that this is not the
currently used Post Office terminology but we believe this is the best approach. Hope that's ok?

The word "embarrassing" has a particular legal meaning in Defences. It's a signal to the Judge that a bit of the Claim
has been very poorly written to cover up for the fact that the Claimants don't believe it to be true.

The word "typically" has been used to mirror the language in the GPOC. In a normal defence, you would never say
"typically" something happens, but give a definitive view on the subject. Due to the generic nature of the Defence that
definitive approach would create hostages to fortune so we've used "typically" to soften certain points. This is the
same word used by the Claimants and so by using their language we cannot be criticised.

At a number of points you ask whether we can positively frame the case. Although I understand why you would want
to do this, it would then create an evidential burden on Post Office to prove that positive case. For example., if we say
that people were instructed to behave honestly, we would then need to adduce evidence of those instructions (which
may mean trawling through thousands of documents and producing witness statements for dozens of people). If we
say that people were not instructed to behave dishonestly, then the absence of any evidence proves our point and it is
Freeths that need to find the evidence to support their allegation.

Kind regards

Andy

Please find attached the draft Defence for your review and comment. As discussed earlier, if possible please provide
comments rather than amendments to the actual text. I've also attached the Claimants’ Generic Particulars of Claim
for reference.

You'll see a few points where input from Deloitte and Fujitsu is needed — we expect to get this today.

Please send any comments to me and Amy Prime (copied).

Thanks
Andy
