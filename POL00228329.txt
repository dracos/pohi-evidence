Bond Dickinson Legal Analysis
Legal risk adjusted claim value

POL has no responsibility for the loss (see analysis below) so should make no payment to the Applicant.

Claim value £7,500
The Applicant claims he repaid losses totalling £7,500 to Post Office.

Has the claim already been barred / determined so that legal 0% £0

Yes — beyond limitation

Responsibility for loss 0% £0

Post Office's position is that to the extent there were losses, the Applicant
is responsible. There is evidence that errors were made by staff and there
is no evidence that Horizon was at fault.

Was contract termination unlawful? 0% £0

No evidence to suggest unlawful termination occurred.

Is there evidence that the Applicant could have "sold" his / her N/A £0
branch as a going concern if given 3 months’ notice?

Suitability for mediation

On the basis of the available evidence, Post Office is not responsible for any portion of the losses in the
branch and this case should not be mediated.

- There is no evidence to support the Applicant's claims that the shortfall was caused by Horizon
or that the level of training and support provided by Post Office was inadequate.
- There is evidence in the call logs of performance issues at the branch

UPDATE FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF FINAL CRR
Changes made by Second Sight: Summary of differences between draft and final CRR

e  Atparagraph 1.2, the final CRR notes that Post Office has provided comments on the draft CRR but
the Applicant has not.

e Atparagraph 1.5 (b)(iii), the reference to “bank/giros/cheques, including automated payment (AP)
transactions” has been deleted as these issues do not form part of the Applicant's complaint.

e Atparagraph 1.6, it is noted that Post Office cannot ascertain from the available records whether the
loss at the branch amounted to £7,500.

e  Atparagraph 1.8, it is noted that Post Office records indicate Horizon was installed in the branch in
November 2000 (the Applicant claims it was installed in September 2001). The paragraph also now
includes Post Office's observation that there is no evidence that: (a) there was a loss of £7,500; and
(b) that this alleged loss was settled by the Applicant.

«  Atparagraph 1.9, the CRR quotes from Post Office's comments on the draft CRR, stating that the
purpose of the audit would have been to verify Post Office assets rather than detecting fraud. It is
also noted that Post Office cannot verify the Applicant's claim that he had an appeal against his
termination turned down, owing to a lack of available documentation.

e  Atparagraph 3.3, the final CRR notes that it is standard practice for a copy of an audit report to be
sent to the Subpostmaster after an audit. This is Post Office's response to the Applicant's claim that
the results of the audit were not disclosed to him.

e Paragraph 3.5 has been amended to add Post Office’s comment that there is no evidence to suggest
the Applicant was treated in a derogatory manner during the investigation process. It is also noted by
Second Sight that, in its view, Post Office's comment has “little evidential value”.

« At paragraph 4.1, which deals with alleged discrepancies flowing from remittance issues, the final
CRR incorporates Post Office's view that errors of this type would only occur through user errors.

e At paragraph 4.5, which deals with the Horizon recovery procedures which follow power failures,
Second Sight suggest that it is impossible for it, or for Applicants, to prove a negative (ie. the
absence of on-screen instructions) and therefore they remain unconvinced that this “suspected
systematic flaw” does not exist.

e Atparagraph 5.2, the CRR confirms that the Applicant's original training records are not available
(further to Post Office's comments on the draft CRR). This paragraph also includes Post Office's
response to the observation that “Post Office no longer offers full Horizon training for branch staff
and...such support is expressly excluded from the Standard Contract”. Post Office's position is that
while it is Post Office's responsibility to train Subpostmasters, where it is appropriate, it will grant a
request for staff training.

e  Atparagraph 5.5, the wording in the draft CRR speculating that a call being marked as “resolved”
may simply mean that the operator was unable to give further assistance, has been deleted.

e  Atparagraph 5.8, the CRR has been amended to give marginally more weight to Post Office's
position. The CRR notes that the Applicant may have sometimes called the TC team rather than the
NBSC and it flows from this that a lack of evidence in the NBSC call logs “provides some evidence
for Post Office's position but is not conclusive.” Previously, the draft CRR suggested little value could
be attached to the lack of evidence in the call logs.

Are there any new legal risks as a result of the final CRR?

No. We confirm that the Bond Dickinson Legal Analysis section above remains unchanged following the
final CRR.

Has the recommendation as to suitability for mediation changed as a result of the final CRR?

No. We confirm that the Suitability for mediation section above remains unchanged following the final
CRR.

Advice qualifications

1. This advice has been produced by applying the principles set out in the Advice from Linklaters dated
20 March 2014.

2. No further legal analysis of the underlying legal principles has been carried out, in particular we
have not considered any other possible legal bases for the Applicant's claims including without
limitation malicious prosecution, defamation, malicious falsehood, breach of confidence, tortious
causes of action or privacy law.

3. We have not analysed the possibility that failures by Post Office in training or supporting the
Applicant, or subsequently investigating losses, may have contributed to the Applicant's ability to
prevent losses in branch.

4. Our advice is based on only the information in the Applicant's Case Questionnaire Response, the
Post Office Investigation Report and Second Sight's Case Review Report. Our advice does not
factor in the possibility of further information being available at a later date that may change our
analysis.

5. We have not considered the Applicant's appetite or capacity to bring proceedings against POL or
any of the "other" factors set out in the settlement mandate.

6. We have not considered any criminal law issues or whether any conviction / sentence may be
unsafe. We have assumed that there are no criminal law risks unless such risks have been
previously highlighted by Cartwright King.

7. We have applied a de minimis threshold to legal risk. Where the legal risk is very small (less than
20%) we have recorded this as 0% in our analysis.
