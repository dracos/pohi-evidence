tlet went live on 11/01/01. PM has raised 75 calls to date an average of 25
alls per week far higher than the norm for a newish outlet. The majority of
calls are advice and guidance and incorrect Helpdesk. The PM called HSH on
5/01/01 and requested further training, the PM was referred to his
NM.....It would appear that there is a training issue here which needs to be
bddressed.
PON act ion
Has PM completed and passed his training?

hen, where and with whom did PM complete training?
fas further training been considered?
closure criteria: PM's calls reduce to acceptable level i.e. 4 per month.

jpdate on problems at outlet from FSM:

This outlet has reported continual phantom transaction problems causing us
to exhaust every possible course of action in trying to solve them.

le have:

H) spent limited time at the outlet watching how he operates the system - no
Ikvidence of swipe head was found

b) collected a weekly detailed list of when the phantoms are happening, what
products, which counter etc - no relevant trends were noted

8) we have replaced all kit and cables on both counter positions

lt) installed a test rig with Comtest software for three weeks to track
interference on the screens - nothing conclusive was found

5) installed a resistive monitor at counter position 1 and sent the old
screen to Pat Carroll for testing (waiting to speak to Pat on his return from
oliday)

fter all this the PM is still experiencing Phantom transactions but they are
mainly on counter positon 1 and this is always used by Robert Parker (PM). I
have asked Robert if I can spend some time at the outlet with him so I can be
present when the phantoms occur but he is not keen for this to take place as
ne feels the outlet is too small and gets too heated as it is.

Ht spoke with HSH this morning and she advises that since Powerhelp was last
rchived, Mr Parker has logged 34 calls to the helpdesk and a vast amount are
ldvice and guidance. My personal feeling is that Mr Parker could do with

some further training and I feel that this should be our next course of
lhction. The only other option we have open to us is to change the ISDN line,
hich is the old style, but myself and HSH feel that this is an expensive
ption to go down when it may be user error at fault.

ON to look at training issues. pursued with PON 17/08/01.

ON have written to the RNM to address the training issue, see text below:
Prom RNM - I spoke to training and Dev. this afternoon and arranged 2 days
training for next week, when I rang Mr Parker he told me that he did not need
the extra training so i have now cancelled it. He also told me that the
Phantom transactions have stopped.
PON to RNM: "There seems to be no issues at this outlet if you are happy with
the postmasters response.
Its there anything else that needs investigating at the outlet proven to be
Hirectly liked with phantom txns (discrepancies?) as there are none recorded?

Ir would like to make you aware though that the postmaster does seem to be
faking quite a few calls still to the HSH helpdesk, mainly around simple
things such as reversals.

M to PON:Thanks for making aware about the number of calls your still
eceiving, i don't think we will ever stop him from making these. I see no
lreason why this call cannot not be closed. as i said the Postmaster said he
is no longer getting these transactions.
calls have actually reduced in September, there are currently only 4. T have
lgreed with PON that there is little else which can be done. The PM is not
aking errors with his work and the call volume has improved.I have agreed to
close the problem.
