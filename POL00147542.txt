I can't attend this meeting but I was looking at the papers to see the post-mortem/lessons learned from the Horizon/SS
stuff. I thought we were told at the Board last week that it was on the agenda for this meeting? What am I missing -
brain cells or paper or neither?!

All

Please find attached the single pdf of the ARC papers ahead of the meeting to be held in the Boardroom at 11am - 2pm
on 6 March. Papers are also available on BoardPad.

As the Audit Planning Report is an interactive pdf I have attached it separately so that you can take advantage of these
features.

Kind regards
Larissa
