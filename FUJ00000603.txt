EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENTS:
Introduce usability enhancements on DeskTop, as agreed with POCL 17/4/00.

OVERALL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: HIGHAMEDIUM/LOW

REASON FOR CHANGE:

Usability enhancements to DeskTop following POCL request at time of Acceptance,
and recommendations from Escher

DETAILS OF CHANGE:

These three changes were detailed in a proposal emailed to Graeme Seedall
(6/4/00), copy Bob Booth. The changes were accepted subject to there being no
cost to POCL (email from Paul Redwood, 14/4/00). Email 17/4/00 from Tony
Hayward stated there will be no charges to POCL and the changes were then
incorporated into the CSR+ product.

Change 1/ Bleep on Input Field (allows DeskTop to bleep on a simple error
condition such as user continuing to press ‘Delete’ after having deleted all
characters from a field.)

Bleep on Input Field is documented in CS/PRO/097 CSR+ Operating Environment PPD
which has been issued for review. The text is as follows:

“Section 5.11.2 Entering data into an input field When the user is entering data
into an input field, the system emits a bleep when the end of the field is reached and
when the user attempts to enter further characters”.

“Section 5.11.3 Deleting data from an input field When the user is deleting data
from an input field, the system emits a bleep when the beginning of the field is
reached and when the user attempts to delete further characters”.

Bleep on Input Field will be documented in the next version of SD/STD/001 Horizon Office
Platform Service Style Guide as follows:

CCN No: 683 Page: 1

FUJ00000603
FUJ00000603
Section 3.3.7 Calculator OCX will include the sentence: “Associated with the
parameter is an audible indicator (bleep) that warns the user that maximum
length has been exceeded and that the data that is being entered currently
will be ignored. The bleep also warns a user who tries to delete more
characters than are present in an input field.”

Section 5.2 General Guidelines will include the sentence: “Associated with the
MinLength and MaxLength parameters is an audible indicator (bleep), which
warns the user either when all data has been deleted from an input field or
when the maximum length has been exceeded”.

Change 2/ Halo on Input Fields (Current field selected for input is given
visual emphasis by outlining field with purple border.)

Halo on Input Fields is documented in CS/PRO/097 CSR+ Operating Environment PPD
which has been issued for review. The text is as follows:

“Section 5.11.1 Moving between fields on data input screens The user can move
between the fields (either by using the touch-screen or the navigation keys to tab
through them). The current field is indicated by an arrow and is surrounded by a
purple halo. Previously-entered fields are indicated by ticks, and empty fields by
bullets:”

Halo on Input Fields will be documented in the next version of SD/STD/001 Horizon Office
Platform Service Style Guide as follows:

Section 2.3.2 User dialogue screens will include the sentence: “A purple arrow
indicator points to the field that is being processed at the moment; the field itself has
a purple halo”.

Section 2.3.2.1 Data input dialogue will include the sentence: “The purple arrow
points to the field that is active, which is also indicated by a purple halo.”

In addition wherever the halo occurs it will be seen in the screens captured in
CS/PRO/097 Operating Environment PPD which has been issued for review and in
the screens that will be captured in the next version of SD/STD/001 Horizon Office
Platform Service Style Guide.

Change 3/ Moving Function Key on DeskTop menu buttons to top right-hand corner
(This provides consistency across all buttons, gives maximum space for text and
distinguishes between instruction and key top.)

All the screens captured in the next version of SD/STD/001 will show this change
and all references to the position of the Function Key on DeskTop menu buttons will
refer to the top right-hand corner.

An attachment to this CCN 683 shows a screen from the current version 4.0
SD/STD/001 together with a screen from the next version of SD/STD/001. The

and the halo surrounding the current input field can be seen.

Charging Mechanism:

Where cost estimates are included, these are quoted as a mid-point estimate of the
work to be carried out by ICL Pathway. The eventual charge will be made on an
‘actuals’ Time and Materials basis using the same man-rates. A 20% contingency
has been included in the CCN to allow for reasonable variation around the mid-point
estimate. The estimate is set so that the ICL eventual charge is as likely to be lower
as higher than the estimate excluding contingency. The contingency is included to
provide allowable headroom for invoicing purposes against a purchase order. Above
this level, ICL Pathway would have to apply for additional approval via a new CCN.
