The above branch has come to my attention due to the fact that the branch
is showing a figure of 434K in Cash In Pouches. This figure is made up of
three values on three different dates.

Value Created On

410,000 18.10.2005
a10,000 19.10.2005
a14,000 04.01.2006

I have checked to see if these values have been processed by the CC and I
cannot find any records relating to these values The data below shows the
values that have been processed by the CC from Ibstock for the period 1st
Oct 2005 - 4th June 2006. (Posting date = the date processed at the CC
not

the date dispatched oy the branch).

Please can you establish whether this is simply a clerical error and
corrections are in hand or if there is a genuine risk of a loss. As of
the

4th June the difference between the branches declared COH figure and the
Generated COH figure is 034,341. Due to the size of the branch Glyn
Burrows would prefer a coordinated approach if there is a risk of a loss
so that he can arrange auditors to be on stand by.

Thanks
