Subject: RE: Post Office Ltd - Draft Prosecution Policy

Dear All
I refer to our meeting of last Thursday and my meeting with Chris on Friday. A couple of matters to be taken
into account when deciding whether POL will continue to prosecute:

1. Freedom of Information Act. Anyone may make a FoA request to a public body (POL) for information
relating to matters of public interest. Banks and other private institutions are not susceptible to such
requests and so it is possible to ‘hide’ information as being commercial sensitive. This is not true of
public institutions such as POL: I would expect the red banner press to make such requests relating
to the number of person suspected of theft/fraud who had not been prosecuted.

2. If POL adopts a non-prosecution policy but, a very high profile/serious case decides to prosecute or
call in the police in, any such prosecution would be susceptible to Judicial Review on the basis that
POL had breached its own non-prosecution policy.

3. A non-prosecution policy would undoubtedly devalue the trust of those honest SPMR’s, for they
would know that those committing offences do so with, at least in the criminal sense, impunity.

4. The dishonest will also know that, at worst, they will lose their contracts and be required to make
good any monies taken by them. It may properly be said that such a policy might encourage those
tempted to steal/defraud POL who otherwise would not. Similarly, those who in any event would
commit offences know that they will not be prosecuted for doing so — a clearer signal to offend is
difficult to imagine.
