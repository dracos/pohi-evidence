                                                                                      WITN10300100




                                                       Witness Name: Rajbinder Sangha


                                                         Statement No.: WITN10300100


                                                              Dated: 20 December 2023


                         POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




      FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF RAJBINDER SANGHA (NEE BAINS)



I, RAJBINDER SANGHA, will say as follows:


INTRODUCTION


1.   I am currently a Release Management Co-ordinator in the Release Management

     team, which is part of the Post Office Account team ("POA") in Fujitsu Services

     Limited ("Fujitsu"). My current role facilitates the administrative process when

     software is deployed to counters, and I am responsible for raising and forwarding

     release notes to Post Office Limited ("POL"). I have held my current position since

     January 2017.


2.   This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

     (the "Inquiry") with the matters put to me in a Rule 9 Request dated 1 December

     2023 (the "Request"), to the extent I have or had direct knowledge of such matters.

     I was assisted in preparing this statement by Morrison Foerster, the recognised legal

     representatives for Fujitsu in the Inquiry.

                                                                                      WITN10300100




3.   Many of the matters set out in the Request concern events that took place between

     7 and 13 years ago. I have tried my best to recall these events and matters to assist

     the Inquiry, but there are areas where my recollection is limited. The content of my

     witness statement therefore focuses largely on the content of the documents

     provided to me by the Inquiry. Where my recollection has been assisted by

     documents, I set out the URN of the relevant document below.


BACKGROUND


4.   The Inquiry has asked me to set out my professional background, including a

     summary of my career, qualifications and the positions I have held at Fujitsu.


5.   Following high school I went to Thames Valley University, completing a Higher

     National Diploma in Business Information in 2003, and a Bachelor of Science in

     Information Systems in 2005.


6.   After university and before joining Fujitsu, I held the following roles:


     a. February 2005 to November 2005—I was a Telephone Executive at MCI.


     b. February 2006 to April 2006—I undertook various temporary administration and

         reception assignments.


     c. April 2006 to September 2006—I was a Customer Service Liaison Officer at Dell

         Computer House.


     d. October 2006 to August 2009—I was a Senior Administrator at ReIQ/EDS (a

         Hewlett Packard company).

                                                                                       WITN10300100




7.   Between September 2009 and June 2010, I took time off from work. In July 2010, I

     joined Fujitsu as a Fraud and Litigation Support Officer in the Fraud and Litigation

     Support Office, which was part of the Security team in the POA's Customer Service

     department ("CSPOA Security Team"). My role initially was to process Audit

     Request Queries (each an "ARQ") from POL, which I explain below. I then became

     involved in additional tasks, which included:


     a. User Management, which involved maintaining a database with the user

         permissions of all Fujitsu employees;


     b. processing security check applications for new sub-postmasters; and


     c. working on reconciliation, which involved dealing with transactions that had not

         completed over the counter.


8.   I went on leave in April 2016. Upon returning from leave in January 2017, I

     commenced in a new role within the POA in the Release Management department,

     which I hold to this date. My work in this role includes (i) managing counter releases

     with POL, and (ii) processing PODG (Post Office Data Gateway) requests, also

     known as OBC19 (Operational Business Change requests) from POL, which entails

     setting up new routes, or amending existing routes of sending and receiving data to

     POL's clients.


FRAUD AND LITIGATION SUPPORT OFFICER ROLE


9.   The Inquiry has asked me to set out my role in relation to POL disciplinary matters,

     those accused of criminal offences, civil or criminal proceedings, witness evidence


                                       Page 3 of 12
                                                                                           WITN10300100
                                                                                         WITN10300100




     and the extraction of audit data, in connection with the Horizon IT system

     ("Horizon"). The Inquiry has also asked me to provide an overview of the

     organisational structure within Fujitsu for the provision of litigation support to POL.


10. As noted above, I became a Fraud and Litigation Support Officer in the CSPOA

     Security Team in July 2010.


11. My role was to process ARQ requests for audit data received from POL, as well as

     internal ARQ requests from Fujitsu staff, which I explain further in paragraphs 15

     and 23 of this statement. For POL requests, the ARQ request would be sent by POL

     to the `CSPOA Security' mailbox by email. Once received, I would follow a process

     to extract the audit data requested by POL from the Audit workstations. I would

     undertake the data extraction in a secure room which could only be accessed by

     myself and other CSPOA Security Team members, which included Andy Dunks,

     Penelope Thomas, and Donna Munro. Once the data was extracted, I would send

     the data to POL on a CD via Royal Mail special delivery. As part of the ARQ process,

     I would verify that the data requested by POL had been provided.


12. I worked alongside Mr Dunks and Ms Thomas, who were also Fraud and Litigation

     Support Officers, and my line manager was Ms Munro. Mr Dunks and Ms Thomas

     dealt with ARQ requests for audit data, however they also performed other functions

     relating to litigation support provided by Fujitsu to POL. These other functions

     included providing Fujitsu Helpdesk call logs and witness statements to POL and

     attending court proceedings. Other than witnessing the signing of witness

     statements, which I explain below at paragraph 20, I was not involved in these



                                       Page 4 of 12
                                                                                       WITN10300100
                                                                                     WITN10300100




     aspects of litigation support and my role was limited to processing the audit data

     extraction for ARQ requests.


13. During my time in the CSPOA Security Team, I did not provide any witness

     statements or attend court to give oral evidence. In order to refresh my memory, I

     have been provided with emails involving myself, Ms Thomas, Ms Munro and Mr

     Dunks (among others) dated in September 2010 (FUJO0156224, FUJO0225726 and

     FUJ00123081). Having reviewed these emails, I can see that in around September

     2010, 1 was asked to provide a witness statement in relation to an ARQ request that

     I actioned (FUJ00156224). While I cannot recall if it was in relation to this ARQ

     request, I can recall speaking with Ms Munro and agreeing that all witness statement

     requests would be actioned by Ms Thomas and Mr Dunks as they had more

     experience and knowledge of Horizon.


14. Over time, the CSPOA Security Team expanded as it took on more work, including

     in relation to User Management and reconciliation.


15. I have been asked by the Inquiry to (i) describe my working relationship with Gareth

     Jenkins, Anne Chambers and Ms Thomas, and (ii) my understanding of their roles

     in relation to providing evidence for court proceedings (and any concerns I may have

     had in this regard).


     a. Gareth Jenkins: I had a limited working relationship with Mr Jenkins. I received

         internal ARQ data extraction requests from Fujitsu staff, including Mr Jenkins,

         which I would process in accordance with the set procedure outlined in

         FUJ00152221. These were internal Fujitsu requests which were raised either


                                     Page 5 of 12
                                                                                  WITN10300100
                                                                                WITN10300100




   via the Peak system or email, and were separate from the ARQ requests from

   POL. An example of an internal request is FUJ00229905, which I explain in

   more detail in paragraph 24 of this statement. During my time in the CSPOA

   Security Team, I knew that Mr Jenkins would provide evidence in court

   proceedings, but as to what that evidence was, I did not know.


b. Anne Chambers: Mrs Chambers worked in the Software Support Centre

   ("SSC"). My working relationship with Mrs Chambers related to calls that

   CSPOA Security Team would raise for reconciliation, which the SSC would

   action. I would interact with Mrs Chambers if I raised a reconciliation call that

   was assigned to her. I do not know what role Mrs Chambers had in relation to

   providing evidence in court proceedings.


c. Penelope Thomas: As noted above, Ms Thomas worked in the CSPOA Security

   Team. Like my role, Ms Thomas' role involved processing ARQ requests that

   were received from POL. Ms Thomas had more experience and knowledge in

   relation to ARQ requests than other members of the CSPOA Security Team,

   and I had a dotted reporting line into Ms Thomas in that I would approach her

   whenever I needed clarification or guidance in relation to an ARQ request. Over

   time, my level of interaction with Ms Thomas changed as the CSPOA Security

   Team took on more work and I became involved in additional tasks as I explain

   in paragraph 7 above, but I would always go to Ms Thomas for guidance if there

   was anything I did not understand about an ARQ request. My understanding

   was that the data Ms Thomas extracted from the Audit workstations in response

   to ARQ requests was used as evidence in court proceedings, together with a

                                                                                     WITN10300100




         witness statement from her. Other than witnessing Ms Thomas sign her witness

         statements from time to time, which I explain below at paragraph 20, I was not

         involved in the process of providing evidence for court proceedings.


LITIGATION SUPPORT


16. The Inquiry has asked for my understanding of the agreement between POL and

     Fujitsu in relation to the provision of litigation support by Fujitsu to POL and the

     details of any changes to the agreement over time.


17. As part of litigation support provided by Fujitsu to POL, there was an agreement

     between Fujitsu and POL that placed a limit on the number of ARQ requests that

     POL could make per year, which did increase over time. I do not remember what

     the limits were or what charges applied if POL went over them as these matters

     were not part of my job remit. I do recall, however, that we would log POL's ARQ

     requests into a database, which would show how many ARQ requests POL had

     made to date.


18. The Inquiry has requested a detailed explanation of the different types of evidence

     or information provided by Fujitsu to support litigation in which POL was involved,

     including the relevant procedures and any changes to the arrangements over time.

     Fujitsu provided the following types of evidence and information to POL as part of

     the litigation support service:


     a. Witness statements: I was not involved in providing witness statements, but I

         understand that Fujitsu provided a statement which noted that (i) certain



                                       Page 7 of 12
                                                                                            WITN10300100
                                                                                       WITN10300100




         members of the team were authorised to extract data from the Audit

         workstations, (ii) the data they had extracted had not been manipulated in any

         way, and (iii) the internal processes for extracting the data had been followed.


    b. Helpdesk call logs: I was not involved in providing Helpdesk call logs to POL.

         These requests were handled by Mr Dunks.


    c.   Transaction logs and event logs: This was the audit data extracted for ARQs.

         Transaction logs contained transactions that had taken place over the counter.

         To obtain transaction logs, I followed the set procedure to extract the data from

         the Audit workstation. I do not recall what event logs are, but I recall they were

         provided by Fujitsu to POL as part of litigation support.


19. The Inquiry has asked me to describe my involvement with individuals in POL in

    relation to the provision of litigation support. My involvement with individuals in POL

    was to process its ARQ data extraction requests, and to advise on when the data

    would be sent back to POL. I cannot recall the names of the contacts I had at POL.


20. The Inquiry has asked what I understood my role and Ms Thomas' role to be in

    relation to witness statements, with reference to FUJ00123054, which is a witness

    statement signed by Ms Thomas dated 14 October 2010 that I witnessed. In relation

    to witness statements, Ms Thomas' role was to extract the data that POL had

    requested via the ARQ request and prepare a witness statement in relation to that

    ARQ request. When asked, I would witness Ms Thomas signing her witness

    statement.

                                                                                          WITN10300100




21. With reference to FUJ00123054, the Inquiry has asked (i) to what extent witness

     statements were `generic' or fact specific, (ii) whether I read or discussed the

     contents of witness statements that I witnessed, (iii) any concerns I had about the

     contents of witness statements, (iv) any communications I had with Ms Thomas in

     relation to the accuracy of witness statements, and (v) any concerns Ms Thomas

     may have had regarding her role as a witness in court proceedings. I understood

     that witness statements were fact specific based upon what POL had requested. To

     witness Ms Thomas signing her witness statement, I was not expected to read the

     contents of the witness statement. I cannot now recall having discussions or

     concerns about the contents of a witness statement that I witnessed. I did not have

     any discussions with Ms Thomas in relation to the accuracy of witness statements

     nor any concerns she had about her role as a witness in court proceedings.


ISSUES RELATING TO AUDIT DATA AND BUGS, ERRORS AND DEFECTS


22. The Inquiry has asked me to set out my recollection of any issues affecting the

     integrity of the audit data provided by Fujitsu in respect of litigation conducted by

     POL, including (i) the identification of any specific issues I was aware of, (ii) whether

     and how those issues were resolved, (iii) my views as to the adequacy of any

     resolution, and (iv) any concerns I may have in relation to the issue.


23. I cannot now recall any specific issues relating to the integrity of audit data, however,

     I have reviewed the documents provided to me by the Inquiry and I can see that I

     was made aware of issues relating to the duplication of transaction records in an

     email dated 27 July 2010 (FUJ00172047) and duplicate JSNs (Journal Sequence

                                                                                       WITN10300100




     Numbers) in transaction records in an email dated 12 November 2010

     (FUJ00228770). I would not have been involved in identifying and resolving such

     issues as this would have been dealt with by more senior and technical members of

     POA. I do not have the technical background or knowledge, both at the time and

     now, to understand the causes of these issues or how they were resolved.


24. The Inquiry has asked me to set out (i) any other knowledge I had in respect of bugs,

     errors and defects in Horizon (including Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online), (ii)

     how I consider they impacted the work I carried out, and (iii) any concerns I may

     have in respect of their impact on POL's litigation or criminal proceedings in which I

     played a role. I do not have any specific recollections of bugs, errors or defects in

     Horizon, however, I would have been aware of them during my time in the CSPOA

     Security Team. Having reviewed FUJ00229905, which contains an email from Mr

     Jenkins to myself dated 13 May 2013, I can see that Mr Jenkins asked me to obtain

     ARQ data to assist him and Mrs Chambers to conduct analysis in relation to a bug

     on HNG-X. As I explain above in paragraph 15 of this statement, I would receive

     and action internal requests from Fujitsu staff to extract data for specific branches

     and date ranges. My role was to process the ARQ requests submitted by Fujitsu

     staff and I was not involved in identifying or resolving the issues relating to these

     requests.


25. The Inquiry has asked me to set out any interactions or communications I had with

     Ms Thomas in respect of (i) the issues affecting the integrity of the audit data

     provided by Fujitsu in respect of litigation conduct by POL, and (ii) bugs, errors and

     defects in Horizon (both Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online), including any

                                                                                      WITN10300100




     concerns that she may have had in respect of her own role. I cannot recall having

     such interactions or communications with Ms Thomas.


26. There are no other matters that I would like to draw to the attention of the Chair.
