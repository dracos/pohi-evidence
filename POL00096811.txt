Subject: PRINTED SubPostmasters and 2nd Sight

Dear Paula,

I have just completed a very good meeting with Ron and Ian from 2" Sight, and Alan Bates from the Justice
for SubPostmasters Alliance. Mr Bates was accompanied by a forensic accountant, Miss Kay Linnell. Both
asked some challenging questions of Ron and Ian, which they answered to Mr Bates’ and Miss Linnell’s
satisfaction.

However the other MPs and I take the view - which I think you share - that so far as we can we should ensure
that as the investigation goes on it retains the buy-in of the sub-Postmasters. To this end I should be grateful
if you would agree to setting aside a small amount of money (capped at £5,000) for a forensic accountant
nominated by the Alliance (likely to be Miss Linnell) to carry out sporadic review of 2"4 Sight's findings. We
discussed this at the meeting, and felt it would be the key to the entire process working for everyone — my
constituents and those of other MPs, the SubPostmasters, and of course the Post Office and its reputation.

I should be most interested to hear your thoughts.
Yours ever

James
