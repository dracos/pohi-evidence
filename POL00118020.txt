Just so that you know your weekend Board paper reading won’t be disturbed - we have not received the embargoed
judgement yet, and will not receive it over the weekend.

We have no indication as to when it will be received, but the Court has confirmed to a journalist that the formal
judgement will not be handed down before Thursday (31*). The Court rules require us to have a minimum of 2
business days advance notice, so we could receive it any day next week (during business hours), although this is not
guaranteed.

Enjoy your weekends.
