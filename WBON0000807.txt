Hugh

Kayleigh Harding (a paralegal) from BD is going to do the minutes going forward (she's already done yesterday's call - they're on my
desk for checking before circulation)

I'm happy to propose that Kayleigh updates the action log as well - however POL needs to give her clear directions as to what goes in
the log and what the actions are? She won't be able to make those decisions as a paralegal.

Kind regards
Andy
