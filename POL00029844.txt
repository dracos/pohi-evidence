The DPA requires that access to personal data remains within the
European Union and PCI data security standards mandate physical
security restrictions must be applied where update access is allowed to
user data. Currently the only units which fulfil all these requirements for
data access are the SSC and ISD Unix. The responsibility for data
correction is vested with the SSC although ISD sometimes act under SSC
authorisation.

Corrections to live system data must be authorised and auditable.

Data corrections

Support activities may lead to a data correction. If any correction is
required then a clear audit trail must exist in the form of narrative on a
Peak incident or an MSC sub task. This should include the reason for the
change and technical detail showing how the change is being carried out.

Financial data

Changes to financial data are rarely required. Where a requirement exists
such changes must be made via contra journal entries to maintain audit
ability. In the very rare cases where this is not possible the change must
be made using the two man rule. The "two man rule" (sometimes called
the "four eyes rule" in security circles) specifies that there must be two
individuals that must act in concert in order to perform some action.
Further, each individual should have comparable knowledge and skill in
order to detect attempts of subversion initiated by the other.

Within the SSC, one member of the SSC will perform the data correction
while a second member of the SSC will witness the change being made.
Both names must be recorded on the MSC for audit purposes.
