Bi RD. IN lit
RIAL - 7™ FEBRUARY 2011

CASE NO: P' 180! 7.

I have a case of R v Gurdeep Singh Dhale, Trial at Bradford Crown Court on
the 7" February 2011. Can the Defendant have identified previous cases
where Horizon case system has been criticised namely Lee Castelton
(Bridlington), Jo Hamilton (South Warnborough), Noel Thomas (Gaerwen), Amar
Bajaj (Chelmsford), Alan Bates (Llandudno), Alan Brown (Calendar Square) and
Julie Ford (Yeovil).

I understand that you and Counsel Warwick Tatford looked at a number of
cases in similar circumstances in my case of Misra and I would be grateful if
you could give me details of that and whether you can identify any other
cases listed above as to whether there was any questions or criticism of the
Horizon system.

If I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.
