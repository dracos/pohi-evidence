Dear Hugh

R -v- ALISON HENDERSON
NORWICH CROWN COURT - WARNED FOR TRIAL WEEK COMMENCING 29 NOVEMBER 2010

Following our earlier conversation on 25 November 2010, I now enclose a copy of a letter
from the Defence indicating a guilty plea.

Additionally, I understand Prosecution Counsel, Miss Dianne Chan has spoken to Defence
Counsel, Michael Clare who has confirmed the guilty plea as mentioned in the attached
letter, on the basis that money has gone missing but the Defendant did not steal it and
there will be no issue relating to Horizon.

Yours sincerely

Miss J S Andrews
Criminal Law Division
