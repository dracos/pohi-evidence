POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF ALAN
BATES

|, ALAN BATES of |

SAY AS FOLLOWS:

INTRODUCTION
| held the position of Subpostmaster (“SPM”) of the Craig-y-Don Post Office, 21
Queens Road, Craig-y-Don, Llandudno, North Wales, LL30 1AZ, FAD code

4616146 (the “Branch’”) from 31 March 1998 to 5 November 2003.

2. This Witness Statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
“Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 19 December

2023 (the “Request’).

3. | have been asked by the Inquiry to respond to a number of questions. Those
questions, my responses and any relevant documents, including those which the

Inquiry asked me to refer to are detailed within this Witness Statement.

WITNO0050100

4. My solicitors, Freeths LLP, have assisted me in the drafting of this statement.
This being said, | can confirm that this statement is written in my own words and

has been approved by myself as being complete and accurate.

Question 1 - Please set out your professional background, including before and

after your time as a sub- postmaster (“SPM”).

5. My professional background, prior to becoming SPM of the Branch, involved a
career in the heritage and leisure project management sector over a 12-year
period. | developed experience in the Electronic Point of Sale systems (“EPOS”),
the development of site-specific business software and the provision of staff IT
training. Following the cessation of my time as a SPM, | have not returned to a

full-time career as | have dedicated years to campaigning for justice for SPMs.

Question 2 - Please summarise the positions or roles you have had in relation
to the campaign for, amongst other things, access to justice and financial
redress for SPMs relating to the Horizon IT System. Please note that more
detailed questions are asked below. It is intended for the response to this

paragraph to be an introductory summary.

6. Prior to and since my termination from the Branch, | have spent the last 23 years
campaigning to expose the truth, and justice, not just for myself, but for the entire
group of wrongly treated/wrongly convicted SPMs. | have dedicated this period

of my life to this cause which, sadly, has been necessary since Post Office
Page 2 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

Limited (“POL”) has spent this entire period denying, lying, defending, and
attempting to discredit and silence me and the group of SPMs that the Justice
For Subpostmasters Alliance (“JFSA”) represents. | also became a member of
the ‘Working Group’ on behalf of the JFSA which oversaw the running of the
Initial Complaint Review & Mediation Scheme set up at the request of Members

of Parliament in relation to this matter in 2012.

TIME AS A SPM

Question 3 - Please describe the background to your appointment as an SPM.

Please set out the process by which you became an SPM.

7. | decided that | wanted to work as an SPM as | had thought that it would bring
secure employment, based upon the fact a Post Office branch provides a
community service and was an established brand in the community. | was also
encouraged by the fact that | could run a secondary business, such as a retail

shop, alongside the Branch.

8. From around 1997, my partner, Ms Suzanne Sercombe, and | began searching
for an available branch. We learned that the Craig-y-Don Branch was available,
and | was particularly interested because it was being sold together with a
haberdashery and general retail business, which was known as ‘The Wool Post’,
and had substantial residential accommodation above it. | knew the location to

be a large community in which a branch was likely to remain an essential service.

9. Suzanne and | arranged for a visit to the Branch via lan Free, a Business Transfer

Agent, who had been instructed by the former owners, Mr and Mrs Savage. The

11.

12.

WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

fundamentals of the business were reasonably clear from the accounts and what
we were able to observe from our visits, there being nothing particularly
complicated about the nature of the business. During our visits, Mr Savage
broadly spoke positively and in general terms about his experience of running a

Post Office branch.

Mr and Mrs Savage agreed to sell the Branch to us (subject to me being
appointed SPM), and on 15 December 1997, Suzanne and | entered into a
Memorandum of Agreement [WITN00050101] for the purchase of the premises
and business at the price of £175,000 and paid the required deposit of £8,000.
This was a major investment for Suzanne and me. It was a large amount of
money, but we were willing to invest it in this way because we were sure there
was a large measure of security in running a POL branch, which was, to our

mind, a relatively safe investment upon which we would likely receive a return.

Having entered into the Memorandum of Agreement, | then looked to making a
formal application to POL for the SPM position. | recall that the process in this
respect involved the current or outgoing SPM tendering his resignation, at which

point POL would then accept applications for the role.

| am unable to recall the precise date, but shortly after | submitted my application,
| was invited to interview, which took place at POL’s regional office in Bangor. |
was interviewed by Mr Jones, and Suzanne also attended, as this was to be a

joint business venture.

Page 4 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

13. On 31 March 1998, | received a letter from Mr Jones confirming that my
application had been successful [POL00041768]. | signed and returned this on

the same date.

Question 4 - Please set out your recollection of the installation of the Horizon IT

System in the Post Office you managed.

14. In October 2000 POL introduced Horizon at my Branch and imposed upon me a
requirement that | use it to record transactions at the Branch and to submit
Branch accounts. To the best of my recollection, Horizon was installed from 2
October 2000. | remember that the Branch was closed around this time to allow

for this.

15. | did not have any involvement in discussions about the introduction of Horizon,
and | had no choice but to accept and accommodate this variation. Obviously,
this was also a huge change in how | operated the Branch, as many of the
previous processes that | had been trained on and had operated at the Branch

were made obsolete not only for me, but also for my assistants.

Question 5 - What were your initial impressions of the Horizon IT System?

16. When Horizon was introduced, given my background with EPOS systems, to
which I refer above, | regarded the introduction of Horizon, at first, as a positive
innovation. However, | did not expect there to be any apparent discrepancies
shown on the system that | was unable to identify the cause of and resolve, either
by myself or with support or information from POL. Certainly, | did not expect

discrepancies to occur for which POL would try to hold me liable without the

Page 5 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

cause being investigated and established. To that point, | had been preparing

accounts manually, using the Capture system.

Question 6 —- Please describe your experience of the following matters whilst

you were a SPM:

a. Your day-to-day working relationship with the Post Office (“POL”) and your

avenues of communication with the company.

17. From around 13 December 2000 onwards POL stated that my Branch accounts
showed a discrepancy of £1,182.81 (which was later revised to £1,041.86).
Therefore, almost immediately after the installation of Horizon, | began

experiencing significant issues with the system.

18. | had been led to believe that SPMs were working in partnership with POL, and
if POL wanted me to measure up to the standards they required, | expected them
to do the same for me. However, over time, it soon became evident that the
‘partnership’ was very one sided, and it really was a question of “you will do as
you are told and if you don’t like it, you can’t complain and there is no redress on

this, and you just get on and keep your mouth closed” — that's how it works.

19. Inaletterdated 13 February 2002 [POL00004590], that | wrote to Glenn Chester
to explain to him, as | had explained to my previous line managers, why |
continued to roll through ‘losses’ and ‘gains’ from week to week without resetting
the system, which in my view would have meant | was accepting the figures the
Horizon system produced without allowing me full access to check the figures

that my staff and myself had entered. Then, following discussions with Mike

Page 6 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

Wakely the latest of my POL Line Managers (the fifth in 3 years) in early April
2003, he wrote to me on 14 April 2003 [page E1/50/41 of POL00004598] to
‘cease with this current practise of rolling over any losses and gains’. In my
response to him on 16 April 2003 | informed him that this had been the practice
ever since the system had been installed at the office and many POL staff knew
of this. | also explained to him why this way of working was being followed, and
that | had explained the reasons in previous correspondence with POL. Following
further correspondence between POL and myself, on 4 June 2003
[POL00004629] POL threatened to terminate ‘my contract’. Such interaction with
various POL staff members clearly exhibits that my working relationship with POL
was extremely strained and it was rare that any communication with POL ever

benefitted me or gave me the impression that | could trust them to support me.

b. Any training you received in relation to the Horizon IT System.

20. In or around September 2000, POL provided a 1.5-day training course of which
my assistants were permitted to attend the first day. | attended on both days. The
training took place at the Imperial Hotel, Llandudno, and was delivered by a third-
party service provider, Knowledge Pool and was attended by approximately 150
other SPMs and assistants at the same time. The introduction of Horizon and its
effect on SPMs and the operation of their branches, and POL’s requirements as
to the use of Horizon were too vast to be covered adequately or at all in the time

given.

Page 7 of 66
21.

22.

23.

24.

WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

The training did not adequately cover how the cause of any discrepancy between
Branch account information shown on Horizon and cash and stock in the Branch
could be investigated or ascertained by SPMs. It also did not inform me that |
would be required to make good any apparent discrepancy in order to be able to

commence any new Cash Account week.

Furthermore, the training did not inform me that | would be required to make good
any apparent discrepancy even if it had not been shown by POL that | had been
at fault or that one of my assistants had been at fault, and/or even if it represented
no economic loss or detriment to POL. It also did not cover how, in practice, POL
would support me when apparent discrepancies arose, investigate them or deal

with any doubt or dispute as to the cause of the same.

Despite my prior experience of EPOS systems, the training provided by POL was
inadequate for the purpose of informing me as to the proper and reliable use
and/or operation of Horizon in the Branch, and enabling me to ascertain the likely
cause of any apparent discrepancy between cash and stock in Branch and the
position as shown on Horizon and ascertaining whether an apparent discrepancy

shown on Horizon was an actual loss and, if so, the likely cause of the same.

In relation to any further training received, on the date of the first weekly balance
of Branch accounts following the introduction of Horizon at the Branch, two of
POL’s Retail Network Managers, one of which was Idris Jones, attended the
Branch. POL’s representatives were no more familiar with Horizon than | was, as

the system was new to them also. If and to the extent POL will say this

Page 8 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

attendance amounted to training, | deny that it was adequate, or that it in any

way addressed the inadequacies of the previous training.

25. On two further occasions, on dates | cannot presently recall, POL provided two
half day support sessions at the Branch, which related to the use and/or
operation of Horizon. This support was provided by POL’s auditor Mr Selwyn
Berry and a Horizon Support Officer, Ms Ki Barnes. This support did not in any

way address the inadequacies of the previous training received.

c. Any support or other advice and assistance that was available to you
concerning the Horizon IT System (including via Horizon Field Support
Officers, contract managers, the Fujitsu helpline or the NBSC).

26. [donot recall any support which fundamentally helped me with any issues.

27. | was first notified about the Post Office Helpline, as opposed to the Fujitisu
Helpline (which | rarely used), in my Appointment Letter dated 30 March 1998
[POL00041768]. It gave the Helpline number and said that this is “the first point
of contact”. The Induction Booklet, which Steve Hughes, my trainer from POL,
gave to me on 8 May 1998, also gave information about the Helpline. The
Induction Booklet described the Helpline as an “excellent service at all outlets”
and explained that Helpline staff would provide “speedy, accurate information
and support to staff, agents, client and the public on all Post Office Counters
enquiries and services’ and would handle “complaints in an efficient and

unbiased manner’.

28. In my experience, none of this happened in practice for me.

Page 9 of 66
29.

30.

31.

32.

33.

WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

My understanding was that the Helpline was a service provided by POL as part
and parcel of their investment into the relationship and the support that they were
meant to provide to me. Looking back, | clearly regarded it as such when
complaining to Graham Harbord of POL by letter on 27 September 2001

[POL00004643] about the service | had received.

POL’s Helpline records which have been disclosed to me indicate that between
21 February 2000 and 23 November 2003, my assistants and | made 507 calls
to the Helpline, 85 of which specifically related to Horizon and balancing

problems, 16 were complaints and 106 related to Branch office processes.

| found that the Helpline was frequently unavailable and/or my calls often went
completely unanswered, without any information as to why, or whether the call
would be answered. Also, different Helpline staff would give different answers to
the same queries. The Helpline staff even gave incorrect advice at time, including
by way of illustration, advice given in November 2003 which resulted in an
incorrect entry of £600 relating to foreign currency being wrongly entered on

Horizon.

| was unable to contact the same person who had been handling my enquiry
which wasted time, increased the incidence of inconsistencies in the advice
given, and deprived me and the relevant Helpline operator(s) of the obvious

advantages of following through an issue to its conclusion.

See paragraph 45 below which refers to this.

Page 10 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

34. As for the other support and advice which was available, it was not effective in

supporting me.

d. POL’s approach to dispute resolution when a discrepancy was identified in
branch accounts.

35. | was not willing to put any cash into the Branch to balance the alleged
discrepancy showing after the 13 December 2000 balance as | did not accept
liability for it, given my (then) understanding of Section 12(12) of the SPM
contract. Due to the way that Horizon worked in practice, it was impossible for
me, as SPM, to accurately track and interrogate and understand transactions
that had taken place and, therefore, determine whether an actual discrepancy
had occurred and satisfy myself that it had arisen due to my negligence,
carelessness or error of me or my staff. | therefore asked Gerry Hayes, in my
letter of 19 December 2000 [page E1/50/134 of POL00004598], to advise me
on how to treat the alleged discrepancy showing on the balance and whether |

should roll over the discrepancy. | never received a response to that letter.

36. | corresponded with Gerry further on this issue and he arranged for Selwyn Berry
of POL to attend my branch on 8 June 2001 to assist with the "resolution of
accounting errors". Although | cannot recall the dates, | do remember that Selwyn
Berry and Ki Barnes came to my Branch in relation to this problem on separate
occasions. However, they were not able to access the system in any further detail

than | could, and their visits did not provide any answers.

37. | was not going to let this issue remain unresolved and took it up further in

correspondence with POL throughout the remainder of 2001. | explained, in
Page 11 of 66
38.

39.

40.

WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

particular, my concerns that the Horizon reporting was "made so complex and
lacks the ability to interrogate the system when you know the information is

inside" (my letter to Sue Perry dated 7 June 2001).

By a letter from Gerry Hayes dated 16 July 2001 [POL00004586], POL conceded
that "neither the visits from Selwyn Berry and Ki Barnes nor the pension &
allowance checks carried out for the problematic weeks, revealed specific
reasons as to how the resultant loss of £1041.86 initially occurred" but, despite
this, continued to demand my "proposals to now make good the loss" as a matter
of urgency. | corresponded further with POL via my line manager, Glenn Chester,

in early 2002.

Finally, by letter dated 6 March 2002 [WITN00050102] | was notified that "Post
Office ...has decided to take no further action in respect of the loss" at my Branch
and that this will be written off. No reason was given, but | have since seen a
copy of a "Write Off Authority" voucher disclosed by POL which gives the reason

for the write off as "Disputed Horizon Cash Account Shortage".

The letter of 6 March 2002 also said POL had taken time to respond because "...
it has been necessary to formulate a consistent response to all such cases". |
take from this that POL was aware at the time of many such complaints. | also
take from the fact that POL was willing to write off the considerable apparent
discrepancy | had disputed that my complaints were valid, and that POL was
aware that was the case and wished to avoid controversy on this matter, given |

was willing to assert my legal rights.

Page 12 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

41. It was clear to me from this point that there were problems with the Horizon
system. Not only was | unable to access the information that | needed to fully
track transactions, but | also did not trust that the system processed transactions

accurately.

e. The availability and / or quality of support from the NFSP.
42. | spoke to the local Branch Secretary of the Federation of SPMs (the “NFSP”),
Dave Foster, about my concerns and was told that many other SPMs were

experiencing similar issues.

43. The NFSP were the only organisation that POL had decided it would recognise
to ‘represent Subpostmasters’, but the fact that they continually failed to provide
real support for SPMs in Horizon matters was widely known. To the best of my
knowledge, the NFSP has never once supported a SPM in any court case where
issues surrounding the Horizon system have been questioned. In point of fact,
the NFSP has actively supported POL in their Horizon position on many
occasions. | received a letter from Colin Baker dated 13 January 2004
[POL00215384] where he said that he had spoken to POL about all of this, and

he said everything was fine.

44. Within the Common Issues judgment, Fraser J found that:

a. “the NFSP is not an organisation independent of the Post Office...The Post

Office effectively controls the NFSP” paragraph 596, [2019] EWHC 606 (QB)

Page 13 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

Question 7 - Please consider POL00004598 (correspondence provided further
to a subject access request) and POL00107462 (correspondence concerning

shortfalls and termination).

a. Please describe your experience of using the Horizon IT System as an SPM.

45. One of my fundamental concerns when Horizon was introduced, which | clearly
communicated to POL through various letters, was the lack of transparency and
control available to me in reviewing transactional data that | and my staff had
entered. | could not fully access data that | needed to in order to properly track,
and if necessary correct, transactions. My concerns about this first became
evident in December 2000, following a particularly difficult balance. | was
therefore clearly dependent upon POL for this sort of information and, therefore,
in order to ascertain the cause of any apparent discrepancy and whether it was

in fact a real loss.

46. | contacted the Helpline seeking support and help as to why this apparent
variance had occurred. They were unable to assist in any meaningful way. | tried
to investigate the matter myself. | printed various reports from two of my three
counter terminals. | left the third terminal for use to serve customers as we were

very busy in the Branch, with customers queuing out the door.

47. Though | understand that Post Office later moved to monthly balancing, during
my tenure | was required to produce weekly cash accounts, which meant that |
had to conduct a balance on a weekly basis, on a Wednesday. When carrying

out this balance on Wednesday 13 December 2000, the Horizon system showed
Page 14 of 66
48.

49.

50.

WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

that there was an unexplained variance of over £6,000 which | eventually tracked

down to Giro deposits.

Using the limited reports, | was able to print, which was a time consuming and
difficult exercise, | ascertained that around £5,000 of the alleged discrepancy
related to Giro items, which had become wrongly duplicated on Horizon. These
reports were in the form of lengthy, multiline, narrow till receipts and were many
metres long, making them difficult to review in any event. At the time, | believed
that a majority of the remaining alleged discrepancy, being £1,182.81, was also
attributable to Giro transactions. However, | was unable to track these potentially

smaller sums in the absence of proper reporting functions on Horizon.

Therefore, far from being within my knowledge, | was unable to ascertain the root
cause of the apparent discrepancy at all. | also called my Retail Network
Manager, Gerry Hayes, the following day to inform him and ensured to follow up
with a letter dated 19 December 2000 [POL00112664_001]. In the absence of a
proper response from POL, | carried over the apparent discrepancy from that
week's cash account to the following week's cash account, by transferring it to a

suspense account, which was visible to POL.

| recall that there had been an overnight software update to the Horizon system
during that cash account week, and at the time | could only think that this process
had been the source of the problem. | concluded that there must have been an
error within the system software due to the number of duplicate entries that had

eventually been found and had been removed. Giro transactions were frequently

Page 15 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

undertaken by all the staff at the Branch and were a simple transaction to

process. The scope of staff error on this was therefore small.

b. Please describe how POL dealt with any discrepancies that arose in your

branch accounts.

51. Please see my comments above in response to this question.

c. Please explain to what data you believed you needed access in order to
determine the cause of discrepancies in the Horizon generated branch
accounts.

52. As detailed in the extensive correspondence with POL, | required access to all
data, even in a read-only format, held on the system in relation to all input by me
and my staff which happened at my Branch. However, in respect of verifying
information regarding those transactions, or the accounts that they ultimately
formed a part of, | could only check transaction logs that were available on
Horizon for limited periods of time or use the limited range of information and
reports | had access to, and which could be printed from Horizon terminals,
comparing those to stock in the Branch. | had no real way of checking information
held in Horizon that came from Post Office itself, or from its clients such as
Camelot or indeed the way in which those had been reconciled with transactions

in the Branch.

d. What response did you receive from the Post Office when raising concerns
about Horizon at this time?

53. Please see my responses above.

Page 16 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

e. Please consider page 22 of POL00004598 and the sentence “The Horizon
system at Craig y Don Post Office has been reviewed and interrogated in
response to your complaints, and the reports from both the Horizon Field
Support team and the NBSC have confirmed there is nothing inherently wrong
with the Horizon system installed at the branch”. What was your view of this
aspect of POL’s response?

54. Whilst the position as stated in the letter is that they had reviewed and
interrogated and concluded that there was nothing ‘inherently wrong with the
Horizon system’, | had seen no evidence of the apparent review and interrogation
that they had claimed to carry out. | was still without the data which | had been
requesting for a number of years. Nor had they discussed their findings with me.
| do not believe that there was any investigation or evidence that the purported

investigation had taken place.

f. What technical IT support had you received in response to your complaints

regarding Horizon?
55. Very little. The Helpline was of no assistance in furthering my understanding of
the causes of apparent discrepancies. The seven calls that | made when having

problems with balancing on 13 December 2000 is but one example.

56. Further, POL were able to communicate directly with Fujitsu and obtain
transactional data and, more generally, any other information on Horizon that
may have been relevant to my Branch or the products/services which | offered. |

had to rely on POL acting as a middleman in this respect and it is choosing

Page 17 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

whether to share any information with me. | still do not know whether POL even

asked Fujitsu about my transactions.

g. Please set out your recollection of the process leading up to and of the

termination of your SPM contract.

57.

58.

By my letter to POL of 13 February 2002 [POL00004590], | expressed my
concerns at POL's suggested approach that weekly balancing be achieved by
either taking money from the Branch or putting it in so that cash and stock
reconcile. My concerns were that it would amount to acceptance of liability for
discrepancies without there being report writing functions to assist me in
ascertaining the cause, and secondly the lack of a record on Horizon of any
shortage or over in a given week. Effectively, what was recorded on Horizon

would not reflect what had happened in real life.

Given these concerns, when | experienced discrepancies, | adopted the practice
of ‘rolling over’ those discrepancies into subsequent accounting periods. |
received a letter from Mike Wakley, my Retail Line Manager at the time, dated
14 April 2003 [page E1/50/41 of POL0004598] regarding that practice. Mike had
not been involved in my previous correspondence with Post Office, to which |
refer above. By his letter, Mike stated that | had to stop rolling over my accounts
and that | had to make good discrepancies without delay. Rather than repeat
myself, | referred him back to my previous correspondence and repeated my
position that it was "totally unreasonable to expect me to accept the liability from

uncheckable data".

Page 18 of 66
59.

60.

61.

62.

63.

WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

Mike maintained the position that | now know to be taken by POL in its Losses
and Gains Policy, which was that Section 12(4) and 12(12) required that "in the
event of any losses occurring" | had to make them good without delay. | refer to
his letter to me dated 2 May 2003 [POL00040363]. This is not the understanding

that | had of Section 12.

| set out my position again in my letter dated 15 May 2003 [POL00004618], which
records my understanding of Section 12 at the time. As | refused to concede this
point, POL threatened termination of my appointment (see the letter from Mike
Wakley dated 4 June 2003 [POL00004629]. | refer to my letter in response to

this threat, dated 12 June 2003 [POL00040398].

Prior to contracting | expected this sort of issue to result in POL offering me more
training or support, or at least trying to find out what was going wrong. | did not

expect to be left with these problems, as was in fact the case.

| received a letter from Mike Wakley dated 5 August 2003 [page E1/50/30 of
POL00004598] stating that “in accordance with Section 1, Paragraph 10 of [my]
Contract for Services” POL were issuing me with “three months’ notice of
termination of your Contract for Services”. The letter simply stated that this would
take effect on 5 November 2003 and gave no explanation for the decision to
terminate. | was shocked that POL considered that it had the power under the

terms of my engagement to terminate with no reason or explanation.

When | first applied to be a SPM, | was not aware, nor made aware, that the
contract with POL could be terminated in such a way. If | knew that such a term

Page 19 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

existed, | would have sought legal advice on this before making such a

substantial investment and most likely would decide to steer clear.

h. Please set out your recollection of POL’s pursuit of the £1,407.38 alleged to
be outstanding in the letter of 21 May 2004 (page 21 of POL00107462).

64. Following my termination, POL conducted a closing audit at the Branch on 6
November 2003. My appointment had been terminated and | was no longer in
the Branch, so | was unable to verify the auditors’ findings. Nor did | oversee
them carrying out the audit, as | was not permitted access. POL alleges that the
final cash account showed a discrepancy of £1,227.61. At the time, | recall that |
was expecting the balance to be short by approximately £200, but certainly not
to the value that POL alleged, it was entirely unexplained and impossible for me

to verify.

65. | received a number of letters from POL chasing me for payment for the sum of
£1,407.38. Those letters continued for a number of months following the
termination of my contract by POL. It is not clear why this figure increased from
the £1,227.61 allegedly discovered at the closing audit and again | had no means
of verifying the cause of any of this. POL said that | am responsible for the alleged
discrepancies "under the contract or services" and that my "responsibility for the

losses does not cease when [my] appointment as Sub Postmaster finishes".

66. For all the reasons | have previously explained above, as | understand the
position, the terms of my contract only imposed liability on me where there is
negligence or error on my part. That had not been established and it is not

possible for me to investigate the matter. | therefore did not respond to any of
Page 20 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

POL’s letters, despite their threatening tone. | did not pay this alleged sum to

POL.

67. | certainly never thought that | was responsible for any supposed discrepancies,
regardless of whether they were real or why they had happened. Certainly no

one told me that before | was appointed.

CAMPAIGNING AFTER TERMINATION OF SPM CONTRACT

Question 8 - Save as set out in response to the above, please describe your
work in seeking (a) to expose the failings of the Horizon IT System and (b) to
obtain redress for the SPMs suffered as a result of those failings up to the start

of 2009. In so doing, please address the following issues:

a. The nature or extent of any support you received in this work, and the

adequacy of the same.

b. Any challenges you faced in this work.

c. What strategy or policies you believed POL adopted in response to your

work.

d. Whether you believe that POL or Fujitsu sought or did in fact obstruct your

work.

68. In 2003, having been issued the termination letter and during my 3 months’ notice
period, | set up the www.postofficevictims.org.uk website. | believed | was not
the only SPM in this situation, and | was trying to connect with others to

understand whether their experience was the same as mine.

WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

By letter dated 27 August 2003 [POL00040354], POL made threats about using

POL imagery on the website.

Following the receipt of the notification of the termination of my contract by POL,
| wrote to enlist the support of my MP, who at that time was Mrs Betty Williams.
| also wrote to Allen Leighton Chairman of Royal Mail Group. The response from
the Chairman's office was predictably to ignore the content contained within all
the copies of the correspondence that | had sent him (comprising of
correspondence already part of this submission) and then failing to have the real
issues investigated. It was the usual box ticking letter exercise, entirely from
POL’s perspective. However, the string of correspondence to and from my MP
and her notes of dealing with POL reveal the approach and attitude of POL with

my case and their arrogant and dismissive way of dealing with SPMs.

| first wrote to Mrs Williams about my case on 27 October 2003 [WITN00050103],
and in turn she raised it with POL and the Minister. Eventually she received a
letter dated 5 January 2004 [POL00040345] from POL informing her that they
had taken a decision to “review the case in its entirety’. But again, this was
carried out behind closed doors and without bothering to contact me. Further to
that letter, POL wrote to my MP again on 19 January 2004 [POL00040368], after
the ‘review’, in which Richard Barker, POL General Manager, finished his letter
stating, “/t is my view that the best interest of all involved with this matter would
be best served by considering the matter closed”. It was at this point that my MP

Page 22 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

wrote to me to inform me that there was nothing further she could do on my

behalf.

72. Yetthe reality of what actually took place during the ‘review’ only became evident
once | had received the documentation about me in response to a Subject
Access Request | made under the Data Protection Act, that is, unless there was

other documentation that was not included.

73. Throughout all the ensuing correspondence and discussions of my case, not
once did anyone contact me to discuss the issues involved, everything was
carried out behind closed doors without me being offered the opportunity to be
heard. Again, it was a case of POL acting as judge, jury, and executioner in
breach of Articles 6 & 7 of the European Human Rights Act, i.e., by denying me
a fair and impartial hearing and inflicting punishment without access to the law

by use of their financial might.

74. |was not aware of Fujitsu doing anything to obstruct me.

Question 9 - Please set out any views you have on the nature and extent of the
support and representation available to SPMs, counter managers and counter
assistants alleged to be responsible for shortfalls shown by the Horizon IT

System through the NFSP and / or the CWU during this period (i.e. to 2009).

75. The CWU were not involved during this period, as | recall. The NFSP, in the letter

from Colin January 200 dated 13 January 2004 to me [POL00215384], stated

Page 23 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

that there were no ‘real problems’ with the Horizon IT System. There was minimal

support provided to me, and certainly none from the NFSP.

The following questions are not intended to limit your answers to the prior ones.

Question 10 - In respect of the website address www.postofficevictims.org.uk

you registered:

a. Please set out the background to this website, its development and whether

it was linked to a campaigning body.

76. | developed this website solely by myself to explain what had occurred, the
attitude of POL and to offer a point of contact for anyone else who had suffered.
| believed | was not alone in my experiences and therefore | wanted to reach out

to others affected in the same way.

b. If it was linked to a campaigning body, please set out the aims of the body,
its membership and its governance structure.

77. \t was not linked to a campaigning body.

Question 11 - Please consider POL00107538 (correspondence file) and
POL00040345 (letter from Richard Barker to Betty Williams MP on 5 January

2004).

a. Please consider the letter at page 11 of POL00107538. Did you contact Betty

Williams MP concerning the closure of Craig y Don Post Office in 2003?

78. | contacted Betty Williams MP in regard to my concerns around the closure of
my Branch.

Page 24 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

b. Please set out your views on the adequacy of support provided to you by

your MP in respect of the issues arising from the Horizon IT System.

79. With what was known at the time, | doubt Betty Williams MP could have done
much more. | do not have any complaints about the adequacy of the support

provided by Betty Williams MP, considering the knowledge at the time.

80. Please see my response to Question 8 above for further details in regard to my

communication with Betty Williams MP.
The JFSA

Question 12 - Save as set out in response to the above, please describe your

work in seeking (a) to expose the failings of the Horizon IT System and (b) to

obtain redress for the SPMs suffered as a result of those failings from the start

of 2009 to the present day. In so doing, please address the following issues (and

the questions below):

81. My work in seeking to expose the failings of the Horizon IT System and to obtain
financial redress for the victims’ group has been and still is a full-time

campaigning post.

82. To give the Inquiry a feel for the extent of work that proved necessary, | would
estimate that, on average from 2009, | will have spent 30-40 hours a week on
campaigning. This includes weekends and bank holidays as my work never

stops.

Page 25 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

83. The steps | have taken are very well documented and publicised through the
various Judgements, for example. These actions have included but are not
limited to:

i. Pre-JFSA: communications with MPs, Ministers, POL, SPMs, lawyers and
other campaigners, media.

ii. Establishing JFSA: building its activities over time.

iii. Extensive ongoing attempts to engage POL to, unsuccessfully, on a voluntary

basis on the part of POL, achieve positive action by them.

84. Taking all necessary steps to progress the legal claim that ultimately proved

necessary.

a. The nature or extent of any support you received in this work, and the

adequacy of the same.

85. Apart from the valuable support from the small number of SPMs with whom | had
been in contact with, there was no external support in the setting up of the JFSA

in November 2009.

86. As time moved on, some valuable support was obtained from people including,
but not limited to, Kay Linnell, MPs and Politicians such as James Arbuthnot and

others, Second Sight and legal support once matters escalated in that way.

b. Any challenges you faced in this work.

WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

The challenges were faced at every step of the way since POL would obstruct
me. The gravity and the enormity of the problem was not recognised by others
in power including Government. And it became clear that the only way to achieve
progress was through a formal legal route which has its own challenges, including

obtaining the necessary funding for this route.

What strategy or policies you believed POL adopted in response to your

work.

POL used their financial might to control the narrative, they would not address
issues openly and honestly. They wanted to answer the questions that they
brought rather than other people’s queries. | would refer once again to the
findings and comments made by Judge Fraser in the GLO High Court
proceedings which give a very clear picture as to the type of policies and

strategies which POL adopted in response to my work.

Whether POL or Fujitsu sought or did in fact obstruct your work.

The primary objective of the JFSA and myself has always been to expose the
truth and achieve justice for the SPMs. POL has sought to, and has in fact,
contained the achieving of that objective, not only in relation to my own work but
also many others including Second Sight and the MPs. One way in which this

has manifested itself has been POL’s approach to disclosure.

| have not had full visibility on Fujitisu’s position in the scandal, so | certainly

cannot rule out that they caused or contributed to some of POL’s seemingly

Page 27 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

obstructive behaviour, and | note Judge Fraser's comments in the GLO High

Court proceedings in regard to Fujitsu’s disclosure of documents to POL.

Question 13 - Please set out any views you have on whether nature and extent
of the support and representation available to SPMs, counter managers and
counter assistants alleged to be responsible for shortfalls shown by the
Horizon IT System through the NFSP and / or the CWU changed during this

period (i.e. from the start of 2009 to the appointment of Second Sight).

91. In my view, it was non-existent. | did not receive any support from the NFSP or
CWU myself and do not believe that substantial support was available for other
SPMs. We often felt as if we were alone in our experiences and the supposed

support available was completely non-existent.

Question 14 - Please describe the background to and the process of founding

the JFSA. Without limiting your answer, please address the following:

a. Your reasons for creating the JFSA, its aims and objectives.

92. My main objective for creating the JFSA was to expose the truth. | wanted to
create a body of former and current SPMs and Branch Assistants which could
provide a community for all those going through the same experiences with POL.
| knew that | was not alone in my dealings with POL and the JFSA was set up in
order to ensure that other people in the same situation as myself knew that they
too were not on their own. As mentioned above, there was a complete lack of
support from POL, and | believe those in similar circumstances required support.

b. The membership, including how individuals became members.

Page 28 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

93. Anyone who reached out to me could become a member of the JFSA. | would
receive phone calls and emails, hence the reason why my work never stopped
during weekends and holidays as | always made myself available to others. The
people who reached out to me would then become members by attending our

meetings.

c. The structure of the JFSA (whether body corporate or unincorporated
association) and its governance.

94. The JFSA was set up as a loose association, it had no formal standing.
Therefore, the JFSA comprised current or former SPM and some assistants,
anyone who was affected by POL or had suffered due to the Horizon system. It
was set up to provide support and so had no formal governance. We would make

decisions via a show of hands.

d. Any sources of funding.
95. There was no funding when the JFSA was initially set up, we relied on the
members to contribute in the ways they could, by bringing food for the members

during our meetings, for example.

Please set out any material changes to the above at the appropriate point of

your witness statement.

Question 15 - Please describe how the JFSA operated from 2009 onwards. In
particular, but without limiting your answer, please address the following

issues:

a. Who was entitled to represent the JFSA and how it made decisions binding

on the association.

Page 29 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

96. Myself and our volunteer professional advisor, Kay Linnell were entitled to
represent the JFSA. All major decisions were taken to group meetings and were
sanctioned by a show of hands from those attending. Although, much of the time,

decisions were dictated by circumstances.

b. The nature and extent of any support and / or representation the JFSA
provided to its members or non-member SPMs.
97. Having formed as a group, the JFSA offered advice to individuals and organised
the group meetings and took forward the campaign to expose the truth. | always
made myself available to all members if they required support or assistance,

whether this be whilst they were still in tenure or after having left their branches.

c. The nature of JFSA’s work in seeking (a) to expose the failings of the Horizon
IT System and (b) to obtain redress for the SPMs suffered as a result of those
failings.

98. The JFSA corresponded with MPs and acted as a central network for support.
Our main work consisted of, but was not limited to, supporting, collaborating and
campaigning. We had set out to move the issue forward however we could,
whether this be by contacting the media, MPs or other individuals of power. We
had legal representation for those who were in the early stages of their dispute

with POL, those who were close to termination or suspension.

The following questions are not intended to limit your answer to the above.

Question 16 - Please consider POL00041564 (11 May 2009 Computer Weekly
article by Rebecca Thomson). Please explain how you came to be interviewed
by Ms Thomson. What were your thoughts on the article?

Page 30 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

99. | initially wrote to Computer Weekly in 2004 following Computer Weekly receiving
a further letter from Lee Castleton, the editor, Tony Collins, assigned Rebecca
Thomson to contact those involved. | worked closely with her, and we identified
a small number of others which became the basis of her article. | never actually
met Ms Thomson having only spoken to her on the phone. The Computer Weekly
article was useful as it was the first time a number of cases had been combined
into one article. It showed that people were not alone, and there was clearly an

issue with Horizon.

Question 17 - Please consider UKGI00016119 (your letter to Edward Davey MP

dated 20 May 2010).

a. Please set out the background which led you to send this letter.
100. | thought it appropriate to make the Minister for Postal Affairs aware of the setting
up of the JFSA and the issues faced by the former and serving SPMs who had

suffered because of POL.

b. Please consider: “Over the years | have personally submitted written details
of all this to the select committee of the DTI, and then on two other occasions
to that of BERR, and, put simply, the information has either been buried or
disappeared”. Please set out the submissions you made to the Select
Committee and HMG (exhibiting any relevant documents to your witness
statement).

101. Please refer to my letters to the Chair of the Select Committee, Martin O’Neill,

dated 9 September 2004 [WITN00050104], 9 October 2004 [WITN00050105]

Page 31 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

and, 5 January 2005 [WITN00050106] which sets out my submissions made to

the Select Committee. | did not receive a response to these letters.

102. In my letter to Mr O'Neill dated 9 September 2009, | explained ‘/ am hoping, in
providing this file to your committee, that you will be able to obtain answers to
the questions Post Office Limited have spent so much time ignoring, they do
need asking and they certainly need answering. They refused to answer them
to my MP, they refused to answer them to the Minister, but at the end of the day
Post Office Limited operates with Government approval, and that includes

approval of the way they operate and run the business.’

Question 18 - Please consider UKGI00016099 (your letter to Edward Davey MP

dated 8 July 2010):

a. If you have a copy of Mr Davey’s letter of 31 May 2010, please exhibit it to
your statement.

103. | exhibit a copy of the letter.

b. Please set out why you considered the response to be disappointing and

offensive.

104. It was disappointing because they had not read or taken into account anything
which | had said in my previous correspondence. It appeared to be a standard
template response. | took offence at the phrase ‘arm’s length’ as detailed in my

response dated 8 July 2010.

Page 32 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

Question 19 - Please provide details of any meeting you had with Edward Davey
MP on or around 7 October 2010. Without limiting your answer, please describe
who attended, what was said and what the outcome of the meeting was. Please

exhibit any notes you have of this meeting to your witness statement.

105. | do not recall the details of this meeting and | do not have any notes of the

meeting.

Question 20- Please set out to what extent you were involved in the intimation
of possible legal proceedings by Shoosmiths on behalf of several SPMs. For
the avoidance of doubt, you are not requested to provide information over

which you or another SPM could claim legal professional privilege.

106. Shoosmiths were instructed by 70 SPMs and former SPMs. They wrote four
Letters of Claim to POL on behalf of four separate SPMs, and | was not one of

the four concerned.

Question 21 - Please set out to what extent you were in contact with Lord
Arbuthnot (then James Arbuthnot MP) and Oliver Letwin MP prior to the

appointment of Second Sight.

107. | did not have any contact with Oliver Letwin MP and had the briefest of contact
with James Arbuthnot, and this would have mainly been about the arrangement

of Second Sight.

Page 33 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

Question 22 - Please consider POL00107331 (your letter to Norman Lamb MP on
25 February 2012) and UKGI00016112 (Mr Lamb’s response). Please set out a
full account of any meeting you had with Norman Lamb MP. Without limiting
your answer, please describe who attended, what was said and what the
outcome of the meeting was. Please exhibit any notes you have of this meeting

to your witness statement.

108. From what | can recall of the meeting, myself, Norman Lamb and one of his
officials attended. | felt it was positive and for the first time had found the minister
who seemed to actually listen to what he was being told and was concerned with
the situation. As he was replaced shortly after the meeting, | had wondered
whether his concern with the Horizon IT System had contributed to his removal.

| do not have any notes from the meeting.

Second Sight Appointment

Question 23 - Please describe to what extent you or the JFSA were involved in

discussions that led to the appointment of Second Sight.

109. We were not involved with the appointment of Second Sight; however, MPs

through James Arbuthnot were keen to seek our approval of their appointment.

Question 24 - Please set out what your initial views were as to the appointment

of Second Sight.

Page 34 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

110. We had real concerns as they had been chosen by POL. We were concerned as
to whether they would undertake a whitewash and were in POL’s pocket in a

similar way to that of the NFSP.

Question 25 - To what extent were you or the JFSA consulted on Second Sight’s

Terms of Reference?

111. Ido not recall being involved in the Terms of Reference.

Question 26 - What did you think of POL’s approach to the complaints made by
SPMs concerning the Horizon IT System at the point Second Sight was

appointed?

112. | was suspicious of POL at this point and the whole Scheme in general. After
having engaged in countless communications with POL over a long period of
time, all of which were sent with the hope of receiving some support from POL,

no one felt as if we could trust POL in all of this.

Question 27 - Please consider POL00107174 (email from Ron Warmington to
Susan Crichton and Simon Baker on 4 July 2012). Please consider “Apparently,
AB had commented along the lines that “this all seemed to be moving rather too
quickly”. Did you make this, or a similar, comment? If so, please set out what

you meant by it.

113. | do not recall whether | made this comment.

Page 35 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

Question 28 - Please consider POL00096817 (email chain on 17/18 July 2012)
POL00096961 (email from James Arbuthnot to lan Henderson on 13 September
2012). Please explain the concerns you had regarding POL’s investigation of

Horizon with Second Sight and how you sought to address these.

114. The idea was, as | recall, that the investigation was due to look at only historic
cases. However, at the same time, the JFSA was receiving information about
live cases, and we wanted these included as well. We believed it would be easier
for Second Sight to investigate live cases, as they would be able to obtain up-to-
date data for the purpose of their investigation. As per my letter dated 13 July
2012 to James Arbuthnot [WITN00050107], | outlined the way in which we had
hoped the investigation would be carried out. This included looking at both
historic and live cases so that Second Sight could perform an accurate

investigation into the current errors which were still occurring.

The run up to the first interim report

Question 29 - Please provide an account of your involvement with Second
Sight’s initial investigation. Without limiting your answer, please address the

following issues:

a. Your role and the work you carried out (whether on your own behalf, on
behalf of the JFSA or of specific SPMs). Please describe the nature or
extent of any support you received in this work, and the adequacy of the

same.

Page 36 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

115. My role was to provide information which | had built up over the years and liaising
with Second Sight on cases when requested. | would assist people throughout
the process (when requested) and ensure they were involved with the
investigation at the appropriate time. If the SPMs were having problems, then
they could come to me, but | was not working with them to formulate their claims.

| would act as a connection between Second Sight and the SPMs.

b. Your working relationship with Second Sight, Lord Arbuthnot, other MPs and

POL.

116. | would liaise with Second Sight, James Arbuthnot, other MPs and POL as and

when required by them.

c. Please summarise the extent of your communications with POL and / or Her

Majesty’s Government.

117. My communications with POL and Government were very occasional, | cannot

recall exact details of these.

d. Your impression of Second Sight’s independence and its ability to carry out

the review. adequately.

118. My impression of Second Sight improved from initial contact with them, | felt more
confident in their ability and could see them operating more independently from
POL. My main reservation at the start had been the fact that they had been
selected by POL, however, | came to see that they were keen on working as an
unbiased third party which improved my confidence in them as an investigating
body.

Page 37 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

e. Your impression of POL and Fujitsu’s approach to the investigation. Please
state to what extent, if at all, you considered POL or Fujitsu sought to or did

in fact obstruct the investigation. Please provide reasons for your answers.

119. Whether intentional or not, POL and Fujitsu’s approach to the investigation was
very slow and seemed obstructive at times. This was due to the lack of access

to documents, which worsened as the Mediation Scheme went on.

Question 30 - Please consider POL00098315 (your email to Ron Warmington

dated 12 May 2013, and others).

a. Please explain what you understood the difference between “system

errors” and “systemic failures” to be.

120. ‘System errors’ might be something like a certain combination of transactions
which may cause the system to interpret the action in a way that was not
expected, and hence might only affect one branch at any time. Then at the other
end of the scale it might be something far more complex resulting from a network
communication failure and an incomplete recovery of a transaction at a particular

office. Ultimately, these could be described as bugs in the system.

121. ‘Systemic failures’ on the other hand could be described as fundamental flaws

across the network which also applies to the way in which POL dealt with matters

in relation to the Horizon IT System.

Page 38 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

b. Please consider “However, | do believe that the investigations you have
undertaken so far have exposed a better route that should be followed”. Can
you please explain what you meant when you said the investigation

exposed a “better route”?

122. This comment was made after the selected cases had been decided for
investigation and before the Initial Mediation Scheme. | thought that they needed
more investigation rather than trying to draw a line under the whole thing with the

Interim Report.

Question 31 - Please consider POL00098418 (your email to Paula Vennells on 21
May 2013). Why did you feel the need “to ensure that [Ms Vennells] have been
receiving the full details of what has been occurring with the 2"¢ Sight
investigation’? Please provide full details of any meeting you had with Ms

Vennells following this letter but prior to the first interim report.

123. There was a concern that perhaps the information was not getting through to Ms
Vennells, as | did not think her staff were feeding back to her. | was concerned
that she was not being told the full story and so | wanted to ensure that she was
being accurately informed of the whole situation. This was, perhaps, a failure in
the way that Ms Vennells handled the situation in that | did not feel confident that
she had been receiving accurate updates and was truly invested in the

investigation and the subsequent events.

Page 39 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

124. | considered it appropriate to approach matters in this way because Paula
Vennells had told me she would be personally overseeing the process and, as

far as | could tell, her involvement had been very limited.

The interim report

Question 32 - Please consider POL00099004 (your email chain with Paula
Vennells on 4 July 2013), POL00115961 (Paula Vennells email of 6 July 2013)

POL00099037 (email chain with Paula Vennells on 6 July 2013)

a. Please set out your interactions with Second Sight and POL in the run up

to the release of the Second Sight Report.

125. As | had seen a copy of the Report, | had concerns about the word ‘systemic,’ |
knew perfectly well that failing to use that in the Interim Report, POL would pick

up on that. | did tell Second Sight this and the MPs, but nothing was done.

b. Please consider the following in POL00115961: “It is worth emphasising
that AB’s main issue is not ‘the computer’ but the human aspect: how in
his view Post Office failed to support and help vulnerable and ‘muddle
headed’ [sic] Spmrs”. Did this accurately reflect your position in

telephone calls with Paula Vennells?

126. They were both an issue, both the computer and human aspect had issues. POL
could have contained issues had they done something about the issues when

they were initially flagged.

Page 40 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

127. After the end of the investigation, it was a question of where do we go from here,
which is why | had a phone call with Ms Vennells. There were then subsequent
phone calls in regard to this, to try and figure out where to go next following on

from the investigation.

Question 33 - Please consider POL00099063 (Second Sight’s interim report),
POL00099091 (email chain between you and Paula Vennells of 7 July 2013) and

POL00029664 (note of meeting at Houses of Parliament on 8 July 2013).

a. Please set what your views were of the interim report. Did these differ from

other members of the JFSA?

128. | am not sure how many of the group saw the Report or whether it was discussed.
Overall, the Interim Report was positive in general as it showed that there were
issues occurring, but we had a real concern over the Interim Report stating that

there were no ‘systemic’ flaws.

b. Please set out what actions you think POL should have taken in response

to the interim report. Did that differ from what POL did in fact do?

129. POL should have launched an investigation into the findings to prevent further
cases from occurring. They needed to show a genuine intention to want to find
solutions. | do not believe that POL showed a genuine intention to attempt to deal
with the conclusions found in the Report. Had it not been for the perseverance

of myself and the JFSA, it is unlikely that POL would have done anything further.

WITNO0050100

c. What actions did you take as a result of the release of the Interim Report,

and why?

130. | did not take any actions purely due to the Interim Report. My aim had and

always has been to expose the truth and | endeavoured to continue in my efforts.

d. Please describe your recollection of the meeting with POL representatives

on 8 July 2013.

131. This meeting was where it came up for the first time about there being 20 trained
investigators on the case, | do not recall this meeting being particularly special.
The purpose of the meeting was to comment about the findings of the Interim
Report. There is not a lot | can add, aside from what is in the minutes. | recall

that it did not result in any major step changes.

e. Do you consider POL00029664 to accurately reflect the meeting on 8 July
2013? If so, why did you feel restricted in what you could say because

POL were present?

132. As mentioned in paragraph above, | cannot add anything further other than what

is in the minutes for this meeting.

Question 35 - Please set out your involvement in the establishment and running
of the Mediation Scheme (including the Working Group). Without limiting your

answer, please provide the following details;

a. What did you understand the nature and purpose of the Mediation Scheme

to be?

133. The purpose of the Mediation Scheme was to address SPMs complaints and
individual cases so that there could be an exploration into the way they had been
treated, with a view to finding a solution for the SPMs which was likely to involve
compensation. It was also set up to establish what had been the truth behind the

circumstances.

Page 45 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

b. Whether you believed the Working Group and/or Mediation Scheme could

fulfil the purpose.

134. At the outset, we thought that the Mediation Scheme might well achieve the aims
it had set out, provided POL would enter it in good faith. We entered into this this

process as we did not have any alternative option at the time.

c. What role did you and / or the JFSA have in setting the terms of references

or the appointment of the Chair?

135. The Chair was a suggestion that emanated from the JFSA, in particular Kay

Linnell. We did not have any major role in the setting of the terms of references.

d. Please explain how the Working Group operated. In particular, please
explain how often the group met and what was discussed. What role did
the different attendees play (i.e. POL representatives; Andrew Parsons of
Womble Bond Dickinson, Sir Anthony Hooper as the Working Group
Chair).

135. The Working Group met face-to-face on a monthly basis and | recall having

fortnightly conference calls in between those face-to-face meetings.

136. The main function of the Working Group was to monitor the progress of cases

through the various stages and to seek to identify and resolve any stumbling

blocks with the progression of cases.

Page 46 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

137. Unfortunately, the financing of the Scheme came from POL and so it provided
the secretariat and admin support which were supposed to be independent.
However, we were not aware at that time that Belinda Crowe was also a member
of POL’s covert project Sparrow team as was POL’s General Counsel as
indicated by the minutes from the Project Sparrow meeting which took place on

9 April 2014 [POL00006565).

138. Anthony Hooper was involved right at the outset, and he was the independent
Chairman. Andrew Parsons was the lawyer for POL and was on the POL side of

the room.

e. Please summarise the work you and / or the JFSA carried out as part of
the Working Group. Please describe the nature or extent of any support

you received in this work, and the adequacy of the same.

139. The JFSA and | represented the claimants, we acted as a voice for the group in hoping
to ensure that the Working Group acted in the best interests of each of the members of

the JFSA.

f. What was your impression of POL’s approach to the Working Group and
/ or the Mediation Scheme. Please provide reasons for your answers and

state whether POL’s approach changed. over time.

140. | was concerned from the outset that POL had no intention of using this as a way
to get the truth out, but we did not know how genuine POL were being. They
would find ways to delay disclosure on claims which furthered my concern in the

Page 47 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

genuine nature of the Mediation Scheme. But it was the only thing we had, so

we had no choice but to give it a go.

g. What was your impression of POL’s policy or strategy in responding to
claims made by SPMs concerning the adequacy of the Horizon IT System
or seeking redress for shortfalls. From your experience, what challenges,
if any, did SPMs face in seeking to obtain redress from POL and what

might some of the causes of those challenges have been.

141. There was a complete lack of engagement or acceptance of any issue from POL.
Disclosure of documentation was the major issue and POL continually extended

deadlines for reporting on cases.

h. Please explain what you thought were the positives and negatives of the
Mediation Scheme and Working Group. To whom did you communicate

that feedback?

142. It was a process which brought together a lot of cases and a lot of information,
which was positive. But on the other hand, it also exposed some of POL’s

reluctance to engage fully in such Schemes.

Question 36 - Please consider POL00026641 (minutes of Working Group
meeting on 30 January 2014). Please explain the nature of the disagreement on

the scope of the Working Group and to what extent this was resolved.

Page 48 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

143. Shortly after the appointment of Christopher Aujard, there was a real change in
POL’s approach to the Mediation Scheme. | am under the impression that he
was brought in to halt any developments. He wanted to change the Terms of
Reference and | said to him that this is not what the Mediation Scheme is about.
| wrote to him after that meeting via email on 8 February 2014 [WITN00050108]
with the Terms of Reference copied in explaining what we believed the Scheme

was about.

Question 37 - Please consider POL00022683 (letter from JFSA to Jo Swinson

MP of 16 April 2014), POL00043627 (referred to above (tbc)

a. Please set out the background to your making these criticisms at this point
in time.
144. Please see my email to Christopher Aujard, mentioned at paragraph 143 above,

which sets out my criticisms of the Mediation Scheme at this point.

b. What, if anything, changed as a result of this communication.

145. In my letter dated 16 April 2014, | set out to Jo Swinson MP how the Mediation
Scheme was meant to work and went on to explain how the Scheme actually
works. | expressed concern at this and how POL had not finalised a single case
report to the point where it is ready for the Working Group to consider its
suitability for being sent to Mediation. | also stated that the main hold up was with

POL. There were no changes, as | can recall, as a result of this.

Question 38 - Please consider POL00026672 (minutes of Working Group

meeting on 10 July 2014).

Page 49 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

a. Please describe the background to and purpose of your proposal to change

the agreed process in respect of decisions to mediate.

146. It never was agreed that the Working Group would discuss individual cases and
make decisions on whether to mediate, it was down to Second Sight to decide
this, then there was the Mediation Scheme which would undertake the process
of mediating between POL and the SPMs. However, two example cases were
discussed prior to Second Sight starting to produce reports, but only to agree a

format in which case reports were to be produced.

b. What were your views on POL’s and the Working Group’s approach on

determining which cases to mediate?

147. | did not believe it was part of the Scheme that the JFSA would be making
decisions on actual cases. My thoughts were that it was down to Second Sight
to make the decisions based on the review of the claimant's case and POL’s

case.

c. What was the outcome of this discussion?
148. | refused to take part, they decided to try and carry on, but | did not want to take
part in this set up. It was wrong for us to try and represent the individuals without

knowing about the cases put forward.

Question 39 - Please consider POL00026685 (Minutes of the Working Group

meeting on 16 September 2014).

Page 50 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

a. Please set out your views on Sir Anthony Hooper’s decision that the Working

Group still had a role to play where Second Sight advised that a case was

suitable for mediation.

149. It was not for the Working Group to make such a decision; we were unable to

make decisions when we had not seen the case in its entirety, nor had we
discussed it with the SPM involved. Second Sight had been working on the case
for a short while and so had the information necessary in order to make such

decisions, and they had also discussed the case with the SPM

b. Please consider “JFSA registered a standing vote to mediate all cases
where Second Sight so recommended and declined to participate in
discussions on those cases”. Please explain the reasoning for this

decision.

150. | did this so that all cases went to mediation, since we could not make the

decision on whether they could or could not without having seen the case in its
entirety, it would have been unjust. Second Sight had the benefit of having
reviewed the cases and so were in the best position to make a decision on

whether mediation was necessary.

c. Please set out why the JFSA did not contribute to debates of cases where

Second Sight did not recommend mediation.

151. As above

d. Please explain why the JFSA nearly left the meeting but decided to stay.

Page 51 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

152. Officially the JFSA did leave the meeting because | refused to attend and discuss
individual cases. We did not stay in the meeting. They recognised this at the time,
and | came into meetings when they were not discussing individual cases, save

for the two trial cases.

Question 40 - Please consider POL00107151 (the JFSA’s letter to Sir Anthony
Hooper dated 10 November 2014). Please explain the background that led to the

JFSA sending this letter. What, if anything, changed as a result of sending it?

153. It had been agreed at the outset we would discuss cases where there was
insufficient information to investigate and only in these cases JFSA would
discuss the individual cases. | sent this letter with a view of clarifying the position,
saying that in certain circumstances, the JFSA would provide some comment.
The Scheme was terminated shortly after this (9 March 2015) so there is little to

say in regard to change following my sending of this letter.

Termination of Second Sight and the Working Group

Question 41 - Please explain to what extent, if at all, you or the JFSA were
consulted by POL on the decision to terminate Second Sight’s contract and / or

close the Working Group.

154. The JFSA was not consulted by POL on the decision to terminate Second Sight’s

contract, we should have been, but we were not.

Page 52 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

Question 42 - What was your view of the decision of POL to agree to mediate all

cases within the Mediation Scheme.

155. Once they terminated the Scheme, it was entirely up to them whether a case
would be mediated, the Scheme had ended so it was up to POL if they wanted

to continue to mediate without the Scheme being in place.

Question 43 - What is your understanding of the circumstances that led to the
termination of the Second Sight contract?

156. | am not aware; it was a decision by POL without any consultation with the JFSA.

Question 44 - Why do you think the Mediation Scheme failed?

157. | believe the Mediation Scheme failed as it was part of the cover up by POL, |
expect POL discovered things that they did not like and did not want to come out.
There definitely was an element of not wanting to accept fault. | believe POL had
no intention whatsoever of getting to a mutually acceptable and fair decision, if
anything it seemed as if POL had been using the Scheme as a fishing expedition

to see what evidence SPMs actually had about Horizon.

The Group Litigation

None of the following questions is intended to elicit information over which you

or another SPM could claim legal professional privilege.

Question 45 - Please set out the background to the decision to issue
proceedings against POL. Without limiting your answer, please provide the

following details:

a. When was the decision made to investigate bringing the proceedings?

Page 53 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

158. | was considering bringing proceedings during the Mediation Scheme, and the

deliberation continued thereafter.

159. We had spent time with Edwin Coe, exploring how we could bring a case,
although we eventually found Freeths LLP who were not only able to assist with
getting the litigation off the ground, but also helped us to secure the funding we
required. Therefore, the ability to issue proceedings was a lengthy one that
involved perseverance culminating in Freeths LLP succeeding in launching the
claim after they fully investigated the claims and decided that the SPMs and

former SPMs had reasonable causes of action to bring.

b. Why was it considered necessary to bring such proceedings?

160. It was necessary to bring such proceedings since everything else had failed, it
seemed the only way forward. It was clear by then that what was required was
for the Court to force POL to do whatever was needed to expose the truth. |
believe that a body of power needed to step in since a voluntary process, such
as the Mediation Scheme, did not provide an adequate solution to those affected

by POL’s actions.

c. What, if any, support did you have from other bodies such as the NFSP, CWU
etc.

161. | do not believe that we had any meaningful support. The CWU did try to provide
some support in offering information but there was a limit to what they could
actually do. | did not receive any support from the NFSP, but | recall Freeths LLP
wrote to the NFSP seeking disclosure of certain correspondence and | recall the

requested documents were not provided.

Page 54 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

Question 46 - Please set out your views on POL’s approach and general strategy
to the group litigation. Without limiting your answer, please address the

following issues:

a. To what extent did you feel that POL had complied with disclosure

obligations?

162. By way of example, from the very start, Freeths LLP were writing to request
copies of the Known Error Logs and Womble Bond Dickinson said they were not
even sure if such a thing existed. This was disingenuous at best. Regarding
Peaks, these were instances of system failure and we/our expert stumbled
across the fact that they existed, and POL had not volunteered this information,
so we had to push for their disclosure as well. Hundreds of thousands of
documents were provided which was no doubt a deliberate attempt to drown us
in documents, and then key disclosure was being provided right up to and
including the trial which could have derailed it and was extremely frustrating.
Andrew Parsons was asked to prepare a number of witness statements
explaining why disclosure orders had not been complied with. POL made it

incredibly difficult.

b. What was your view of the witness and expert evidence led by POL?
163. Their witness evidence was consistent with everything POL had done over the

years, they protected POL from the truth being revealed at any cost.

164. In Fraser J’s Common Issues Judgment ([2019] EWHC 606), he noted the fact
that POL made use of Mr Abdulla’s computer experience as he had obtained the

title of ‘Computer Champion.’ Mr Abdulla went on to say that ‘it was just his title,

Page 55 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

and did not mean he was an IT expert’ (paragraph 226). Given that POL relied
so heavily on Mr Abdulla’s assertions, despite he himself admitting that he could
not be described as an IT expert, demonstrates the fact that supposed expert
evidence provided by POL was not dependable by any means.

165. Furthermore, Mr Carpenter of POL informed the Court that he had encrypted an
interview between himself, and Mrs Stockdale and the encryption key had been
lost. Fraser J stated that he was ‘sceptical of such an explanation given that POL
had supposed IT experts at their disposal and that POL had instructed a digital
forensics consultancy (paragraph 293). This clearly demonstrates the lack of
reliability of the POL supposed experts and furthers the idea that POL were

reluctant to expose the truth.

c. What was your view of POL’s decision to issue an application for Fraser J to
recuse himself?

166. My view of the decision to issue an application for Fraser J’s recusal was that it
was made out of desperation. The application had immediate ramifications and
it seemed as if POL were trying to delay everything so that we would run out of
money. It was a truly irresponsible decision; a responsible corporate would not

do this.

167. The Court of Appeal, in their decision to refuse permission for POL to appeal the
decision not to allow Fraser J’s recusal stated that ‘the recusal application never
had any substance and was rightly rejected by the judge (paragraph 50, PTA

A1/2019/0855). Such a statement furthers the notion that POL brought this

Page 56 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

application simply to cause delay and that their decision was completely

irresponsible.

Financial and other redress

Question 47 - Please set out in detail your account as to the events leading up

to the settlement of the litigation insofar as you consider it relevant to the

matters being investigated by the Inquiry (and only insofar as you consider you
are able to without eliciting information over which you or another SPM could
claim legal professional privilege).

168. It is public knowledge that POL knew we had funding for the litigation, they will
have known that we had access to a finite pot of money, and the harder they
fought, the more that funding would be depleted, in my opinion this was a very
cynical approach. The Steering Committee and | were advised by Leading
Counsel and Freeths LLP that it was in the best interests of the Claimant Group
as a whole to settle the proceedings at that time. POL had effectively outspent
the 555 Claimants and the risks of continuing with any litigation without adequate
funding, and possibly without ATE insurance, was not a risk which any of the
Claimants should have taken, given they have suffered to much already at the

hands of POL.

169. It was hoped, at the time of the settlement, that the judgments we had secured
would prove to be a foundation for further steps, which, thankfully, has proven to
be the case with the overturned convictions and, more recently the ex-gratia GLO
compensation scheme. We had achieved what we set out to achieve which was

to expose the truth and this was to be the key to all that has followed.

Page 57 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

Question 48 - Please set out the extent of your involvement with seeking

financial redress since the GLO proceedings were settled.

170. Following conclusion of the GLO proceedings, | invoiced the Government for the
cost of the legal action, which included everything from the £58 million settlement
which was not available for payment to the Claimant group. | did so because it
was a case which the Government was responsible for, being the sole
shareholder and it had fallen down on its role to properly oversee and manage
POL. Since then, | have sustained continual political pressure to secure support
for the SPMs and | and others have sought financial redress for SPMs as a whole
which Government eventually realised we were entitled to and in March 2022,
DBT (known as BEIS at the time) announced a scheme would be set up to ensure
the GLO group received full and fair financial redress to put them back in a
position that they would have been in were it not for POL and its Horizon IT

System failures.

Question 49 - To what extent, if at all, do you believe that POL has properly
delivered upon its commitment to improve relations with the SPMs? Please
provide reasons for your answer.

171. | am not aware that it has achieved this as | have not seen any evidence of a

commitment from POL to improve relations with SPMs and assistants.

Question 50 - If you have applied for compensation pursuant to one of the
schemes, please set out your views on the process of making such a claim. In

particular, please identify any positives or negatives about the process.

Page 58 of 66
WITNO0050100
WITNO0050100

172. The process for compensation of financial redress of the monies SPMs are
rightfully owed is taking far too long, not just for myself. A key component was

Post Office disclosure which has been at the root of this delay.

General

Question 51 - Who and / or what do you think is to blame for the Horizon IT
scandal?
173. This is a question for the Inquiry, | have some views on this, but it is more relevant

what the Inquiry’s view is.

Question 52 - Is there anything further relevant to the Inquiry’s terms of
reference of which you think the Chair should be aware?

174. | do not have anything further to add.

Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this statement to be true. | understand that proceedings for
contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes or causes to be made,
a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest

belief in its truth.
