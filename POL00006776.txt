Martin —I just wanted to follow up on the various case reports that you have sent through to me, principally
so as to ensure that you are not waiting for any further input from this end. In that connection, I
understand from Rod that your standing instructions are to act on the recommendations set in your reports
unless you hear from POL to the contrary. If that is your understanding, I would be most grateful if you
could confirm that back to me by email when you have a moment.

Kind regards

Chris
