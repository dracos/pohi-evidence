                                                  Statement No.: WITNO6130100
                                                  Dated:   15th June 2023


                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




             FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF MICHELLE STEVENS




I, Michelle Stevens, will say as follows...

   1. I am providing this statement in response to a written request under Rule 9 of

       the Inquiry Rules 2006, made on behalf of the Chair of the Post Office Horizon

       IT Inquiry, which I received on 11 April 2023. This request contained 36

       questions relating to Phase 4 of the Inquiry (action against Sub-postmasters

       and others). I can confirm that I have looked at all documents shared with me

       and wherever possible, referenced within my statement.

   2. I am a Post Office Ltd employee and have worked for the business for 27

       years (see POL00088420). During this time, I have held different positions,

       all within the back-office functionality based at Future Walk, Chesterfield. I

       started as a casual employee working 2 days a week before securing a full-

       time temporary contract. I worked on a temporary contract for a period of time

       prior to achieving a permanent contract in February 1995 as a postal

       assistant. After several years I applied for a promotion to postal officer and

       was successful. Although this function remained in back office, I was away

                                                                                    WITNO6130100
                                                                                WITNO6130100




   from the operation working as an admin support which was similar to a

   personal assistant for two heads of areas.

3. It wasn't until much later I was appointed as the Client Settlement and

   Automated Payments Enquiry Manager and stayed in post for 5 years. My

   primary accountability was to ensure settlement was made to clients on a

   daily basis, by their contracted payment method and payment terms. The role

   also covered customer and client enquiries relating to automated payment

   transactions completed at the counter.

4. Following an internal structure re-organisation, I was asked to cover the Post

   Office Ltd SAP (POLSAP) Systems Masterdata Manager and spent

   approximately 1 year in post. This role had the accountability of ensuring the

   delivery of transactional files were received into the finance system and that

   POLSAP had updated as expected. All exceptions were owned and managed

   until resolved. I also managed the Chart of Accounts to provide assurance

   that the general ledger account management was maintained and that

   requests to create new ledgers or make changes were understood and if

   necessary, appropriately challenged.

5. As I was due to return from a period of leave, I applied for another role as the

   Former Agent Debt team leader and was successful in my application. I was

   only in post for 6 — 7 months and left in May 2013 for a further period of leave.

   I returned and remained in post for several years.

6. I did not cover the Crown Office Network, however, my accountabilities were

   to manage transactional and non transactional discrepancies on account after

   a postmaster had left the business or had given up the branch. They may

   have been a current postmaster at one or more branches. Non transactional

                                                                                    WITNO6130100
                                                                                  WITNO6130100




   discrepancies were added to the postmaster account if they had not paid

   under the terms of the invoice. Transactional discrepancies settled following

   branch trading were visible on account within the financial accounting system.

7. Transaction corrections (TC's) requiring action after the postmasters tenure

   was manually added to the account with information to support the TC. The

   purpose of a TC was to correct a transaction in branch and to balance the

   account. These were generated by product, within back-office teams of the

   Financial Service Centre (FSC). It is my understanding that for any queries,

   all TC's issued by FSC had a contact telephone number or they were

   requested to contact the NBSC and the number supplied. If the branch had

   no information to suggest the TC had been issued incorrectly, they would be

   requested to settle the amount centrally pending further investigation or await

   third party evidence.

8. TC's superseded error notices on the introduction of branch trading. A hard

   copy letter I email would be sent to the former postmaster providing details

   and evidence of the transaction. (see POL00000127). Although the

   postmaster was not `in service' they were able to dispute discrepancies and

   supporting information would be posted. It was my understanding that

   postmasters were required to make good all losses under the terms of their

   contract, caused through carelessness, negligence or error. (see

   POL00088904 Section 3.1).

9. Anything under £150 would be absorbed by the branch and settled centrally.

   This in my words would be the branch accepting liability, however, anything

   over £150 would be settled to the postmaster account. At the time I

   considered this satisfactory, as if one month the account was in debit, it was


                                  Page 3 of 10
                                                                                    WITNO6130100
                                                                                 WITNO6130100




   anticipated that the account would have the compensating credit the following

   month at their trading period. (The settled centrally process changed in April

   2021 and postmasters could settle any amount). A `block' could be placed on

   the postmaster account within the finance system if an amount had been

   disputed.

10. In an attempt to recover outstanding debt, hard copy letters were issued to

   the postmaster detailing outstanding discrepancies and a statement of

   account. (See POL00000109). These were known as the Dunning letters.

   This process was only actioned if the case wasn't being managed by Security

   or the outstanding balance was low value and written off.

11. There was a write off policy to adhere to with amounts structured to manager

   grade and value, for control purposes. (See POL00090357 section 12.0). I

   don't recall when, however, I do know that credits were posted separately,

   and the general ledger accounts were reconciled at period end detailing all

   postings made within the period.

12. Dunning letters would be issued to the former postmaster at twenty-one days,

   fourteen and then seven should there be no contact. A decision would then

   be made on next steps depending on the value outstanding and if any known

   transaction corrections would be associated to the account.

13. Were we aware of any assets, was there a guarantor and what notes had

   been captured by any respective departments during this period of time.

   Depending on findings, discussions were held between Post Office Ltd and

   DAC Beachcroft LLP for their considered opinion.

14. Following discussions, options would be considered and POL to provide

   instruction on next steps. This would be to either issue a Letter Before Action,


                                  Page 4 of 10
                                                                                       WITNO6130100
                                                                                  WITNO6130100




   advising that if no contact was made, we may wish to progress with legal

   proceedings. If after the letter was issued and potentially, there may still be

   no contact, we would agree on the next course of action. This could be to

   either write off the amount, or to continue with proceedings. This was never a

   decision made independently and would be agreed based on the

   documentation gathered within the file.

15. 1 would ask questions asked such as, what was the value outstanding, did the

   postmaster have assets, did they manage another Post Office, did they have

   a good or bad credit rating? Was there another Charge or several Charges

   registered against the property? If the case had previously been with security,

   were there any admissions and what were their findings etc? When this

   information had been collated, further discussions would be held regarding

   next steps and potentially, the senior manager looped in.

16. 1 don't recall the time period, but a review of the three letters were conducted

   by Alison Bolsover and Angela Van-Den-Bogerd and the third letter was

   removed. A further review, managed by Jo Milton, was conducted in 2020 to

   enhance the letters to be more of a sign posting letter. Amendments were

   made following feedback from Postmasters later in the year and over the next

   twelve months where positive feedback was received into my team.

17. If the former postmaster did contact my team, we would work with them to

   understand their current circumstance and discuss options. This would also

   depend on the value of the discrepancy. If a postmaster requested to repay

   but asked for this to be by instalments, it would generally be agreed, and the

   postmaster would set up a monthly standing order. On occasion, the former

   postmaster would request to repay earlier than first agreed or may also ask

                                                                                 WITNO6130100




   for a further extension. Following a review of account, would most likely be

   accommodated. Details of the plan would be documented and sent to the

   postmaster.

18. If a decision was made to progress to court, a bundle would be sent to DAC

   Beachcroft (see POL00113467) and they would review the case. It may have

   been that further information had come to light and they would provide advice,

   managing all aspects of the case.

19. If a case had gone to court it would progress in stages, starting with a County

   Court Judgment (CCJ) against the postmaster. If however, we were aware

   that the postmaster had assets, a house for example, and there weren't

   several Charges on the property already, this would be considered to secure

   the outstanding debt.

20. If the Judge awarded the decision in favour of POL the monthly repayments

   would come via the courts into POL's bank account or the postmaster would

   create a standing order, send a cheque or make a card payment. This wasn't

   always actioned so my team would make a courtesy call to postmaster to

   discuss. If the postmaster advised they were planning on making a double

   payment the following month, this would be accepted, however, a reminder

   would be made to advise that neither party could deviate from the original

   order as we were regularly requested to accept lower amounts.

21. Payments would be accepted until the account was settled and if a Charge on

   property had been made, we would agree to remove at the end of the term.

22. It's fair to say that the debt associated with former postmasters continued to

   increase over the years. Continuous process reviews were exercised to

   determine if there were better, more effective ways of reducing the balance


                                   Page 6 of 10

                                                                                WITNO6130100




   and what, if anything, could we do to fix it. My team also engaged with

   contracts team and security team and would work together. We would also

   advise if the postmaster had accountability for any other branches and notified

   them of any outstanding discrepancies on account.

23. As the former postmaster manger, I followed a Death in Service process.

   Each case was managed with sensitivity. A letter would be issued to the next

   of kin to notify them of any outstanding discrepancies on account. If on

   receipt they contacted the team, the account would be discussed. If no

   contact made, a second letter would be issued requesting contact be made

   within fourteen days and again, if no contact, a third letter was issued

   requesting contact within the next seven days_ If no contact received, a

   decision would be made regarding the value of the debt and next steps. This

   would be discussed with the senior debt recovery manager and, or POL's

   legal team.

24. My recollection of the civil actions (and am referred to the relevant

   documents) against Aslam Ramtoola,             GRO         ; Kevin Palmer (I am

   referred to POL00113467, P0L00079413, P0L00079423, P0L00080021),

   Rachel Williams, Frank Holt (POL00113448, POL00080889, POL00081027,

   POL00081033) Susan McKnight Tracey Etheridge (POL00081189), Katherine

   McAlerney (POL00075270, POL00078858), Keith Macaldowie, Lee Castleton

   and Julie Wolstenholme. Some names I recognise but I don't retain any detail

   and would need the case files to refer to in order to provide any recollection of

   their account".

   25. In February 2017 I was asked to cover the role of Senior Debt Recovery

         Manager on a temporary basis due to absence. This was part of my

         managers role and was an extension of the work I was already completing.

         Additional responsibilities were to manage strategic change, understand and

         complete the monthly provision process and review debt processes for a

         losses project sponsored by the Chief Finance Officer. After approximately 9

         months, I returned to my substantive role when in 2018 I was asked to take

         accountability of the current agents accounting team.

   26. 1 continued to manage the accounts of both current and former postmasters

         until leaving the team at the end of February 2023 to start a new role. During

         my time as the Former Postmaster manager, I had no detailed knowledge of

         bugs, errors or defects within the Horizon system. Any discrepancies were

         managed within the SAP financial accounting system and would have an

         equal and opposite entry. I followed the processes governed at any particular

         time and had no reason to doubt the system. When this was more commonly

         talked about, I could not understand why the discrepancies were only relating

         to debits and not credits.




Statement of Truth
I believe the content of this statement to be true.
