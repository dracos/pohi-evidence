Andy

Please see the email below from Graham Brander. Is this similar to the
request that was made to you by Steve Bradshaw?

I wonder if this is something that we need to review and I will pick it up
with Penny as we have a meeting in a couple of weeks.

In the meantime if there are any problems with this latest request can you
please let me know

Regards

Jane

Hi Jane

Juliet McFarlane has asked for Andy Dunks to produce another statement in
respect of Up Hatherley case, producing as a separate exhibit, the full
schedule detailing all calls to HSH within the specified period (01/04/08 —
11/12/08). It looks like this is how CLT want all future statements

produced by Andy, as opposed to some being version 2 type.

Please would you ask Andy if he can produce a schedule showing full details
of all calls to HSH, giving explanations where necessary. Obviously, this
statement / exhibit is required asap to be served as further evidence.

Thanks
