POST OFFICE LIMITED v SEEMA MISRA
WEST BYFLEET SPOB
CASE NO: POLTD/0708/0249

1 enclose copy of my minute dated the 1° April 2008 to Investigation Team Post
Office Limited c.c. to Adrian Morris advising that in my opinion the evidence
was sufficient to afford a realistic prospect of conviction of the above named on
the charges set out on the attached schedule, copy enclosed.

In view of the serious nature of the alleged offence involving theft of £74,609.84
together with offences of false accounting I advised that in my opinion this case
was more suitable for trial in the Crown Court. Once the decision has been
made then the matter should proceed to obtain summons.

I would therefore advise that it is a matter of urgency that we proceed to obtain
summons.

Hf you wish to discuss any aspect of the above please do not hesitate to contact
me.
