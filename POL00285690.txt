Dear Sirs

Post Office Group Litigation
HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248
Horizon Issues Trial

We write further to the email sent by the Claimants’ solicitors to the Managing Judge's clerk on 27
September 2019 at 12:29, which brought to the Managing Judge's attention that 32 documents relating
to the Horizon Issues Trial were disclosed by Post Office on 25 September 2019.

During the course of responding to a number of queries that the Claimants’ solicitors had raised in
relation to the disclosure of these documents (which can be located at [H/358] of the Horizon Issues Trial
Bundle), it has come to Post Office's attention that a statement within its EDQ is incorrect and that there
may be previous versions of the Known Error Log that have not been disclosed to the Claimants. Please
find enclosed a letter which was sent to the Claimants’ solicitors today explaining the background to
these documents coming to light and the proposals which have been made in respect of providing any
disclosure which may be sought by the Claimants.

We would be grateful if this letter and enclosure could be provided to the Managing Judge so as he can
be informed of these matters.

Yours faithfully

Qlamde Bork Adonsn.
