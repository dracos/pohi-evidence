Peter ci rest

Thanks for this, can you please put together a matrix incl dates and times for Neneh and Penny to visit the names youv'e
suggested for discussion around the areas which Penny has identified in each case. Once done can you arrange a
meeting with Graham Ward for you Neneh and Penny + myself to discuss with him the various areas which we feel no
longer apply or are obsolete.

I don’t want it to interfere with their trip to the Datacentres though around Mid Jan (check with Bill) and we could see
Graham Ward late Jan 06.
As a starter for ten I have listed the names and areas of concem below and left attached the statement in question.

Also please send all and cc me a copy of the matrix when completed.

Thanks.
Brian Sheldon LST or Mik Peach = Report Generation
Bill Membery = AW's at the Datacentres

Alan Holmes Controls

Gareth Jenkins Harvesting Transactions
Counter Dev Team = View Horizon Terminal and applications

Graham Ward = OBCS now obsolete
