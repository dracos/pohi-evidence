Hi Lucy,

Further to Angela’s message below, we were unable to locate the relevant documents prior to 2011 at Post
Office. We have requested RMG to search for the relevant documents in their archives and we are chasing
daily. When is the absolute final date by which you need an answer?

Hi Lucy
Johann is now able to respond to the Credence points and will do so as a matter of urgency.

Having read the documents you attached I question the appropriateness of not disclosing the attached 2012
documents? In particular the HNGX comments by E&Y. Cc’d to Rod for his view also.

Angela, Johann,

Thanks for your email and apologies I missed your call earlier. We have the following documents (they have not been
disclosed as it stands):

1, 2012

« POL IT Management Letter Final Draft 12/06/12; and

« POL Control themes and observations document (unsigned and contains POL comments). I understand from
looking at correspondence that the control observations report represents the overall document (and appears to
have been used from 2012 onwards) that the E&Y finance team produced.

2. 2013

POL IT Management Letter response 31/05/15; and
« POL Control themes and observations document (signed final version).

There is no specific mention of credence in these documents and my understanding is that this is because of the 2011
current year update comments which states: "Application not in audit scope for FY11. Therefore, we are not able to
comment on whether management has fully addressed our comment as raised in the year prior".

Kind regards,

Lucy

Hi Angela,

Lisa and I are working through subsequent ARC and Board minutes, but the details are limited and Lisa have
not yet found the noting papers referred to. I have also asked Finance if they have a copy of the EY
management letter for 2012 as this may provide more information.

We have come across the following entry from the Board meeting of 12 Jan 2012. There are references to
two documents that might be helpful — a significant litigation report and a RMG internal audit report, both
appear to support the IT controls for Horizon. Lucy, are you aware of these documents?

POLB12/07 SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION REPORT
- Noting Paper (POLB(12)13)

(a) Les Owen asked for assurance that there was no substance to the
claims bought by subpostmasters which had featured in Private
Eye.

Susan Crichton explained that the subpostmasters were
challenging the integrity of the Horizon system. However the system
had been audited by RMG Internal Audit with the reports reviewed
by Deloittes. The audit report was very positive.

The Business has also won every criminal prosecution in which it
has used evidence based on the Horizon system's integrity.

ACTION: Susan Crichton suggested that she clear the audit report with the
Susan Crichton external lawyers and if it is possible to give the report privileged
status it would be circulate it to the Board.

Best regards,

Johann

Do we have the subsequent ARC minutes or updated actions so that we can see what became of the Chris

Lucy - given that we provided the E&Y management letter for 2011 as part of our disclosure, did we also

Hi Angela

Below is an extract from EY’s audit results report for FY2012, which was submitted to the May 2012 ARC
(thanks Lisa for tracking this down). It states that the IT control environment has improved, but that more
work is required.

We noted that the IT general control environment for POLSAP and HNGX has improved in
comparison with 2010-11. However we observed that some of the control improvements had not
been fully implemented or embedded at the time of the audit and that there were some
remediation efforts that were not completely aligned with our expectations. There were also some
findings from the previous audit which require further work to close.

Since the completion of the IT audit, we have discussed our control observations with POL
and Fujitsu management, and are currently finalising our management letter which will
provide details of our findings, observations and agreed management actions.

Unfortunately there is not much detail and it refers to a management letter that was still to be finalised.
Below is an extract from the ARC minutes. Other than asking Fujitsu to provide a SAS70 certificate, there
were no other actions to address the remaining IT issues.

ce) IT

It was recognised that the IT controls in the business had improved and
that there had been a change in the governance and management of the
Fujitsu contract. The auditors found that the IT systems were insufficiently
effective to be fully relied upon for audit control purposes. However, through
adopting mitigating procedures, Ernst & Young had been able to rely on the
IT systems supporting the POL financial statements. It was noted that the
POL and Ernst & Young IT teams were working closely on an agreed plan of
further improvements in FY13.

It was recommended that the business insist that Fujitsu provide a

ACTION: Chris Day SAS70/ISA402 certificate to provide a transparent audit of their controls.

So we are still not clear on whether the control weaknesses in question were addressed. I suggest we ask
Finance if they have a copy of the final management letter for FY 12 to see what exactly the remaining IT
control issues were? Failing this we could ask EY for a copy. Any throughts?

Angela,

As Garry has mentioned, this report precedes the existence of Post Office Internal Audit. In addition, we do
not routinely track actions raised by external audit.

I will contact CoSec to see if the ARC papers and minutes provide more information. I will also look at
subsequent EY reports to see if these findings were raised again in the following year.

Catherine, Johann,

As part of the Post Office litigation, WBD our external lawyers are drafting our witness statements with us in
response to allegations made by the other side. The one I need your help with in is respect of Jason Coyne,
the Claimants’ IT expert who refers to an audit document produced by E&Y in 2011 (see attached) which
identified issues with the credence application, namely weak change controls within the back end of the
systems allowing Logica developers (the third-party provider) to move their own uncontrolled changes into
the production environment. He goes on to say that "further documentation to approve fixes and patches
applied to Credence outside of the release process were lacking, therefore linking changes to issue tickets to
record the original request for the bug fix was not possible".

We need to understand whether these comments are correct and whether anything changed in light of the
report.

My expectation is that we as a business would have taken action as a result of these findings by E&Y and
would have documented what that action was. I understand from speaking with Garry that we didn’t have
own POL internal audit function at the time as this was within the Royal Mail group structures.

Mark Hotson has already provided some information (email below) but that is about current practices rather
than in 2011 following the E&Y report.

Could I ask that y« th consider the initial request from Lucy (first email in chain) and provide responses
from your respective areas that will help to provide an adequate response from us (POL) as part of the
evidence we provide to the Court.

As I’m sure you’ll understand this is urgent as we are on a court deadline to submit our witness statements

by 4pm on 13" November but we need to get our draft statements to our Counsel early next week. So could I
request that you give this your most urgent attention.

Subject: RE: Horizon issues - witness evidence [WBDUK-AC.FID27032497]

Morning Lucy,

Further to the below, I have discussed the attached document, specifically items referenced “12”, “13” and
“14”, internally and provide the following updates. These responses are based on current knowledge as those
consulted were also not employed by POL at the time when the audit report was written:

Generally, since the report was written there has been:
1. A change to the IT Supplier (from: CMG Logica to: Accenture).
2. An upgrade to the application (from: Business Objects v3.1 to: v4.1).

3. A re-platform of the underlying database (from: a mix of CMG Logica locally-hosted (non-
production) environment and a Fujitsu hosted (production) environment to: Microsoft Azure
cloud hosting for non-production and production.

“12 - Credence (back end) change process”

e “Developers at Logica, the third party provider of application development and support for Credence,
had access rights to the production environment and the database that would permit developers to
move their own changes into the production environment.”

* “Documentation to approve fixes and patches that are applied to Credence outside of the release
process does not always exist. We were advised by Logica personnel that for a sample of four changes
selected evidence of approval to move into production did not exist and that it would not be possible to
link the changes to problem tickets to record the original request for the fix / patch.”

All changes* are under the control of Accenture and are subject to a robust Change Management
process. *These changes include: fixes — planned and emergency, project changes and security changes.
Each change is subject to approval at the “CAB” (Change Approval Board)

Further to this, as the hosting is now Microsoft Azure the implementation of patches and fixes are
subject to Microsoft security best practices.

WBD_000152.000012
WBON0000282
WBON0000282

“13 - Credence (front end) change process”

e = “During our walkthrough of user administration of the front end of Credence we noted several users with
administrator rights, including some generic users (this is noted below as a separate point). These users
have the access rights to create and amend reports, including those which may be relied upon for audit
evidence. These users can change report design, and processing without documented request, test or
approval.”

e “When users have the rights to change reports that are used by the business for reconciliation, exception
reporting or other processing, there is the risk that the reports are manipulated either intentionally or
accidentally.”

Users with administrator rights now purely carry out administrator tasks only, i.e. no reports are created
or amended by users with such rights.

In addition, a Power App has been implemented which logs and controls requests for change (new and
existing reports) carried out by POL personnel. Similarly, requests for changes/new reports that are
assigned to Atos information Services are logged and controlled via the Atos Service Catalogue.

“14 - Credence (front end) configuration”

“We noted several control weakness in Credence front end user administration and security configuration:

1. The password configuration is not aligned with network settings or those settings required by Post Office. We
noted:

a. there isno minimum password length

b. Password complexity rules are not applied

c. users are not required to change their password
d. password history is not retained

e. idle session time-outs are not in place”

The below screenshot provides the current (as at 25/10/2018) Business Objects Central Management Console
enterprise settings relating to passwords — this addresses the above:

e = “There are three generic administrator accounts without specific users assigned to these accounts. One of
the three accounts has not been used since April 2009.”

Only 1 full Administrator account remains which is used for administrative activities only by the POL
Credence Administrator.

e “The process for requesting and granting user access rights to Credence does not maintain documentation
to record evidence of request or approval of access rights.”

This activity is now governed and controlled by the IT Service Desk. Service tickets are used to log and
control requests.

e = “There is no process in place for the revocation of user access rights when a user separates from the
organisation or moves to a new role no longer requiring access rights to Credence.”

Housekeeping is actively performed on a regular basis and redundant user accounts are terminated
accordingly.
