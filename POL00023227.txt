Please see attached “recusal note" from Lord Neuberger.

This has just been received. I am reading it now.

Ashort e mail to check we are "at one" on forward facing actions. As I see it the running order is as follows:

- We get Neuberger QC recusal comment/advice this eve’

- Ifa runner’ we need to decide between Grabiner QC & Mark Howard QC. That decision could be made
tomorrow or early next week. From e mails I sense that you are leaning towards MHQC.
- We then instruct the QC who would "do" the recusal advocacy (assuming they too concur with the Neuberger

view of the world)

- Alongside the above work stream we will also get input from Neuberger QC over Common Issues appeal at

some point next week (I hope. That is the timeframe I'll push for)

- We then take decisions next week (post Neuberger QC advice) over steps in Common Issues appeal (as to

who/when etc).
