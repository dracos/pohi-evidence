Brian,

I've had a look at the ARQs and | think there is sufficient info there to explain in most cases why there are zero value
transactions. | suggest the following as a brief explanation:

There are three main reasons why a zero value transaction may be generated as part of the banking system:
1. The transaction has no financial effect (ie a Balance Enquiry or a PIN Change)
2. The transaction has been declined by the Bank
3. There has been some sort of System Failure

Each transaction has associated with it a Response Code field which identifies what has happened. These
values are included (together with their descriptions) in the ARQs. In summary:

e RespCd = 1, means that the transaction was Authorised by the Bank. If it is for zero value, then this
means it had no Financial effect. In all the example, such transactions were PIN Changes or Balance
Enquiries where this is indeed the case.

e  RespCd has a value between 2 and 10 means that the transaction was Declined by the Bank. The
actual value indicates why (eg 3 means that the PIN was invalid and 4 means Insufficient funds)

e RespCd with a value greater than 10 implies some sort of system failure.

Does that provide you with enough detail? Identifying exactly why a given response code was generated in each case
and the exact circumstances under which each one can be generated is much harder, but | suspect that is
unnecessary in this case.

From the examples the following are the Response Code values that occur:
1 - Authorised OK
3 - Declined - Invalid PIN
4 - Declined - Insufficient Funds
6 - Declined - Usage (amount)
8 - Declined - Other
23 - Timeout
26 - Failed by Fl: System Unavailable - Return Card

Note that the text varies in the ARQs, but the meaning is basically the same.

Re Tel-con

As discussed please see extract from a recent email below in italics from Graham Ward......regarding
providing a statement about nil transactions and online banking. If you are able to put something
together for us I would be very grateful. If you send it bak I will arrange for Neneh or Penny

to write into a statement for your signature.

On a separate matter, I also require a witness statement in respect of the following ARQ's 0506/401,
459 and 460, all of which relate to Gaerwen SPSO.

We need the usual (leave out para's H(b) and J, but we do need para K (call

logs) covering an analysis over the period 01/11/04 - 30/11/05, Penny - you may recall this one which
relates to nil transactions, my previous e mails dated 14th, 21st and 25th October refer. Can you add
an extra paragraph in your statement explaining how on-line banking transactions are processed
and the data downloaded and how nil transactions can occur.

Once again Many thanks for your assistance in this.
Regds Brian
