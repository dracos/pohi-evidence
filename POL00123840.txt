Dear All.

Please see below the attached Board Paper and Draft Policy for criminal prosecutions going forward. This is subject to
approval by the Post Office Board.

Before any case papers are forwarded to Cartwright Kings for advice on prosecution, they now need to go via myself
for approval for submission. Firstly I want to control costs, if it clearly meets a NFA criteria, then I do not wish external
lawyers being paid to advise as such. Secondly, as this is now subject to far more scrutiny, I wish to have sight and
understanding before going to the lawyers rather than just on return. Can you please ensure this is started with
immediate effect.

This does not stop engagement with the external lawyers for the conduct of the investigation including them to have
sight to advise on further enquiries, but not to advise on the prosecution element and recommendation.

We can discuss further at the Investigation Governance Forum.
Regards.
John.

As discussed, we have undertaken that the Prosecutions Policy would be reviewed by the Board at the meeting on 22
January. Accordingly, I attach a covering paper together with a copy of the policy — this should be addressed under
AOB and is for noting only.

Once noted (and therefore accepted) by the Board, the following steps must be completed:

© ~Acopy of the policy must be made available through the website as soon as possible following the Board
meeting — ideally on Monday 25 January. Rod/Patrick - please discuss with Comms - note that the header
must come off the document that goes on the website

e The policy must be reviewed annually by the RCC and the ARC —I have provided that such reviews must
happen by the end of each financial year and that the first such review must therefore happen before 31
March 2017. Georgina /Alwen — please make sure that these reviews are added to the rolling agenda for
POL00123840
POL00123840

each such committee. Mark - this is not one of the 26 policies that support the Control Framework, but you
need to be aware of it. I can provide you with the background.

e The review will include a report on the number of cases that have been referred to prosecution and
confirming that in each case the requirements of the Policy have been complied with. John/Rod — please log
this as an action.

Many thanks everyone for getting us to this point!
Jane
