Hi both
lassume that this should be the briefing from Mark/Sophie, with David’s speaking note for the call over the top so Paula
can have a quick look at how the meeting is being positioned.

Best wishes
Belinda

Might we say 1.30pm on the 18 March? If so, can you advise which number is best to reach Paula at that time?
Many thanks and have a great weekend.

Kind regards,
Janet

Janet,

Ahead of the MPs meeting on the 24"" Paula would like to speak to James and I wondered if we could try and arrange a
phone call between the two of them. I wondered if James had any availability on the 18"?

Thanks
