                         FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER MARK DAY




            I, Christopher Mark Day, will say as follows:


            I.       INTRODUCTION


            1        I held the position of Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") of Post Office Ltd ("POL")

                     from August 2011 until December 2014.


            2        This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry with

                     the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 8 March 2024 (the "Request").


            3        The facts within this witness statement are either within my own knowledge or

                     belief, or derive from the records provided by the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

                     or POL. However, as it relates to events that occurred in some cases up to

                     thirteen years ago, there are several areas that I do not recall. Where that is the

                     case, I have said so.

            4        I have had limited disclosure of documents from the Post Office Horizon IT

                     Inquiry and POL. Unfortunately, the documents provided to me are incomplete

                     and therefore have assisted me in only a limited manner. Nonetheless, I have

                     endeavoured to answer all questions in the Request to the best of my ability.


            5        I have been assisted in preparing this witness statement by Kingsley Napley

                     LLP.



            II.      PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND


            6        I graduated from the University of York with a degree (Upper Second Class) in

                     Economics in 1983. In 1990, I achieved a Masters of Business Administration

                     ("MBA") in Finance from City University, London.


            7        I started my career as a graduate finance trainee with Beecham Group Plc from

                     1985 to 1987 in their Group Treasury Department.


            8        From 1987 to 1989, I worked in the trading team (marketing foreign exchange

                     products and options strategies) of the investment banking division of

                     Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company of New York (now JP Morgan Chase &

                     Co).


            9        After completing my MBA, I worked as a management consultant at KPMG from

                     1990 to 1991.


            10       In 1991, I joined Grand Metropolitan Pic, as Treasury Dealing Manager. I then

                     became Assistant Treasurerâ€” Risk Management & Dealing Operations in 1993

                     and then Director of Corporate Finance & Capital Markets in 1995.

            11       In 1997, Grand Metropolitan Plc merged with Guinness Plc to form Diageo Plc.

                     At Diageo, I became Director of Group Treasury Services from 1997 to 1999,

                     Finance Director UDV SJ (the Netherlands) from 1999 to 2002 and Finance

                     Director, Germany and Austria from 2002 to 2005.


            12       I joined the BBC in 2005 as Group Financial Controller until 2011. My role

                     included a four-month period (in 2008) as Acting CFO, at which time I was also

                     a member of the BBC Executive Board.


            13       I then joined POL in August 2011 as CFO, a position I remained in until I left

                     POL in December 2014.


            14       After I left POL, I managed and subsequently negotiated the sale of a small

                     family business (2015-2019). In 2020, I joined the Board of Trustees and

                     became Chair of the Audit Risk & Finance Committee of a local almshouse and

                     dementia care charity.


            15       I have never been made subject to any warnings, reprimands or disciplinary

                     action in my career. I do not have any previous criminal convictions or cautions.


            III.     ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES AT POL


            16       As CFO, I was responsible for the financial management and external financial

                     reporting of POL. In particular, given POL was in receipt of public money, we

                     had a duty to account for how that money was spent. A core part of my

                     responsibilities and duties as CFO was therefore ensuring that all financial

                     statements were true, fair and accurate, and ensuring that the yearly audit was

                     conducted properly. Day to day, I was responsible for financial accounting,

                     management and statutory reporting, budgeting, financial planning and

                                                                                                   WITN10000100
                                                                                                 WI TN10000100

                     analysis and the provision of commercial finance support, business

                     performance management and corporate finance services (tax, treasury, cash

                     and working capital management). My role and responsibilities did not

                     materially change during my three-year tenure as CFO.


             17      I had around eight direct reports and was responsible for approximately 250 full

                     time employees from the following teams: Corporate Finance, Network

                     Finance, Commercial Finance, Financial Planning and Analysis, Change

                     Management, Financial Reporting, and Product and Branch Accounting. All of

                     the teams falling directly under me were based in London (except for Product

                     and Branch Accounting, which I discuss further in para. 18 below). The heads

                     of the teams based in London reported directly only into me as CFO. I would

                     see them on a daily basis.


            18       The Product and Branch Accounting division was the team responsible for the

                     back-office accounting system. During my tenure, the team was based in

                     Chesterfield and led by Rod Ismay. The Product and Branch Accounting

                     Division reported into me in relation to providing aggregated data and

                     information for the purpose of producing POL's management information and

                     financial reports. However, the team also reported into the Chief Information

                     Officer ("CIO") in relation to the ongoing management and maintenance of the

                     core accounting systems and software. I had face to face meetings with Mr

                     Ismay every couple of months.


            19       In 2014, Paula Vennells, Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), decided to combine

                     the finance and IT functions to reduce her number of direct reports. Lesley

                     Sewell (CIO) therefore also reported into me in the final months of my tenure.

            20       I was recruited to bring a more commercial focus to the finance function in

                     anticipation of POL's separation from Royal Mail Group ("RMG") on 1 April

                     2012. The position I succeeded previously had the title of `Finance Director'.

                     The repositioning of the role as `CFO' was intended to reflect the focus of the

                     role to: drive the financial performance of the business; provide commercial

                     support; and help POL compete on the provision of government services, with

                     the aim of creating a business no longer dependent on public subsidy.


            21       I was recruited by and reported into Ms Vennells, who was CEO of POL when

                     I joined and for the whole duration of my tenure.


            22       I have been asked whether my salary as CFO was directly or indirectly linked

                     to the revenue or profits made by POL. My salary was not linked to the financial

                     performance of POL. However, my annual bonus and, from 2012 onwards, my

                     Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") was calculated from a `scorecard' which

                     comprised of targets linked to a number of qualitative and quantitative factors,

                     including managerial, leadership, cultural and financial measures. I understand

                     that all senior managers within POL had the same bonus structure/LTIP,

                     although the percentage of salary targets varied within seniority.


            23       I have been asked why I left POL. When I joined POL, I saw the role as one I

                     would be unlikely to stay in for more than three years, consistent with most of

                     the senior roles I had held previously in my career. In late 2013, in a

                     conversation with Ms Vennells, I said that I could not commit to staying at POL

                     for a further three years. By 2014, I felt that the role had run its course: I no

                     longer enjoyed it enough to consider staying. However, the precise timing of my

                                                                                                      WITN10000100
                                                                                                    WI TN10000100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 81AFC40A-7FC9-42E3-966B-320BE0F2480F




                     departure was determined by Ms Vennells who had identified a successor CFO

                     who would join in January 2015. Therefore, I left POL at the end of 2014.


            24       For the avoidance of doubt, the claims and issues relating to the Horizon IT

                     System played no part in my decision to leave POL, or the timing of my

                     departure.


            IV.      POL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE


            25       When I joined POL in August 2011, POL was still owned by RMG. On 1 April

                     2012, POL separated from RMG, and RMG was subsequently privatised.

                     During my tenure, POL's ultimate shareholder was always the UK government,

                     represented by the Shareholder Executive of the Department of Business,

                     Innovation and Skills ("ShEx") which sat within the Department for Business,

                     Innovation and Skill ("BIS") (as it was known then).


            26       I was always conscious of my duties as a director throughout my time at POL.

                     In summary, I had a duty to promote the success of the company, exercise

                     independent judgment, reasonable care skill and diligence, and act only within

                     my powers. I did not consider my duties and responsibilities as a director of

                     POL to be materially different from those of a director of a publicly-owned

                     company.


            27       I have been asked to provide my views on the responsibilities of a Board of

                     directors in the operation of a company solely owned by HM Government,

                     specifically in relation to oversight of the company's criminal prosecutions, civil

                     litigation, IT and accounting system. My view is that the Board has a collective

                     responsibility for the oversight of the general business of POL, including over



                                                         Page 6 of 49
                                                                                                  WITN10000100
                                                                                                WI TN10000100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 81AFC40A-7FC9-42E3-966B-320BE0F2480F




                     these areas. However, individual Board members had particular oversight over

                     the areas covered by their direct reports.


                     A.      Pre-separation


            28       Prior to separation from RMG, the POL Board meetings were chaired by the

                     Royal Mail Holdings' Chair (initially Donald Brydon, then Alice Perkins from 22

                     September 2011), with at least one other RMG director (Moya Greene (CEO)

                     and/or Matthew Lester (CFO)) in attendance from RMG. I cannot recall exactly

                     who attended from POL, but I have been shown [POL00021500] (minutes for

                     the POL Board meeting on 4 July 2011) which shows that at least at the meeting

                     of the POL Board on 4 July 2011, Ms Vennells (Managing Director of POL at

                     the time), Susan Crichton (Company Secretary, but resigned at the meeting),

                     Sarah Hall (Financial Controller), Alwen Lyons (ratified as Company Secretary

                     at the meeting) and Martin Moran (Commercial Director) attended from POL. I

                     believe the agendas for the Board meetings were set by the Chair, Ms Greene

                     and Ms Vennells. In preparation for POL's separation from RMG, a number of

                     Non-Executive Directors ("NED" or "NEDs") were appointed to the POL Board

                     in late 2011/early 2012.



            29       I recall Ms Vennells would have regular meetings with Ms Greene and, from

                     time to time, both Ms Vennells and I would be invited to RMG Board meetings

                     to report on POL business and/or financial performance to RMG. I cannot recall

                     if Ms Vennells was a member of the RMG Board.

            30       After POL's separation from RMG, the POL Board comprised the CEO, CFO,

                     Chair, one Senior Independent Director ("SID") and four NEDs, including a

                     representative of ShEx. There were no RMG representatives on the Board,

                     however we continued to work closely with our RMG counterparts for at least

                     two years to ensure the full and effective separation of all accounting, reporting

                     and IT interdependencies. Individual members of the Executive Committee

                     ("ExCo") (see below para. 34) and other subject matter experts from the wider

                     business would also attend POL Board meetings by invitation or agreement of

                     the Board for specific agenda items. Board members were provided papers in

                     hard copy and the meeting agendas were determined by the Chair and CEO.


            31       Post-separation, POL reported directly into ShEx. We held monthly meetings

                     with BIS, attended by myself, Ms Vennells and occasionally Ms Perkins from

                     POL, and three to four representatives from BIS. We reported on the

                     performance of the business and any current or imminent business risks. My

                     primary role was to present on POL's financial performance. I had a good

                     working relationship with civil servants within BIS, and we (my team and BIS)

                     were in frequent communication by telephone and email on matters of financial

                     management and, when required, POL's financial performance. I therefore was

                     not involved in briefing ministers or MPs (except as set out in para. 77 below).

                     A ShEx representative also sat on the Board. I believe the ShEx representative

                     was responsible for briefing ministers and they may have asked Ms Vennells or

                     Ms Perkins to attend these briefings when required.



            32       I have been asked to comment on the level of technical IT expertise of those

                     attending the Board. I do not recall. As CFO, I understood the core finance

                     processes and would have been able to discuss related IT issues with our

                     auditors. Ms Sewell was CIO and therefore would have had a higher level of IT

                     expertise, although she was not on the Board.



            33       I have been asked to describe the POL Board's subcommittees, their

                     membership and their terms of reference. I have been shown document

                     [POL00184703] which is a Board pack for the meeting of the Audit Risk and

                     Compliance Committee ("ARC") on 13 February 2013, which contains a

                     document titled 'Publication of our Report and Accounts â€” Key Messages',

                     which summarises the subcommittees of the Board in Annex 3. I have used this

                     document to help formulate my response below:



            33.1     ARC was a subcommittee of the Board. I have been shown [POL00158012]

                     which contains the Terms of Reference for ARC dated November 2012. ARC's

                     purpose was to assist the Board in fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities by (i)

                     contributing an independent view on the accounting, financial control and

                     financial reporting practices of POL; (ii) taking all reasonable steps to ensure

                     accurate and informative corporate financial reporting and disclosures which

                     meet appropriate accounting and corporate governance standards; and (iii)

                     providing oversight of the company's risk management systems, operational

                     controls and key systems. I believe ARC met at least quarterly and meetings

                     were chaired by Alasdair Marnoch (POL NED). As per [POL00158012],

                     standing members of the ARC were Alasdair Marnoch, Tim Franklin, Neil

                     McCausland and Susannah Storey (all NEDs). Other permanent invitees

                     included     the HR Director or General Counsel and              Head of Risk

                     Governance/Head of Internal Audit. The CEO and CFO were expected to attend

                     all meetings.



            33.2     The Remuneration Committee was responsible for making recommendations

                     to ShEx on the remuneration of the Executive Directors.



            33.3     The Nominations Committee was responsible for recommending to the Board

                     any changes in Board membership and to manage the process for recruiting

                     and replacing directors.


            33.4     The Pensions Committee was responsible for working with the trustees of the

                     Royal Mail Pensions Plan on the valuation of the funds, strategic asset

                     allocation for POL sections and to monitor investment performance.


            33.5     The Mutualisation Committee was established to consider future possible

                     ownership models for POL.


            34       While not a subcommittee, ExCo was the most senior management body below

                     main Board level. ExCo was made up of the CEO (who would chair the

                     meetings) and each of her ten to twelve direct reports. ExCo's purpose was to

                     implement the strategy agreed by the Board and monitor business performance

                     and development at the operational level. [POL00184703] says ExCo met

                     formally at least once a month, but I also recall weekly Monday morning

                     meetings. I was a formal member of ExCo and would chair meetings in Ms

                     Vennells' absence.


            35       The Risk and Compliance Committee ("RCC") was a subcommittee of ExCo. I

                     have been shown [POL00183698] which is the Terms of Reference for the RCC

                     dated November 2012. This document says that the purpose of the RCC was

                     to support ExCo in fulfilling its effective oversight of governance, risk and

                     compliance by: (i) overseeing the coordination of governance, risk and

                     compliance activities across the organisation; (ii) ensuring the effective

                     establishment and application of (a) risk, internal control and policy frameworks,

                     (b) risk appetite setting, (c) a positive risk and compliance culture; and (iii)

                     advising the ARC and ExCo on risk and compliance matters. As per

                     [POL00183698], membership comprised at least three ExCo members,

                     including the CFO, HR director, CIO and either the Commercial Director or

                     Strategy Director. The CEO did not attend. The RCC met at least four times a

                     year.


            35.1     There was some overlap between the matters dealt with by the RCC and ARC.

                     However, the RCC's remit was enterprise wide risk and compliance issues,

                     whereas ARC was more focused on external financial reporting risk, together

                     with material wider risk issues identified by either the Board, ExCo or RCC. The

                     RCC reported into ExCo â€” ExCo monthly meetings would include an update

                     from the RCC. ARC, on the other hand, reported directly into the Board (minutes

                     of ARC meetings were reviewed by the Board).


            35.2     I have been asked to set out my role in attending meetings of the RCC. As CFO,

                     I attended to report on and consider financial risk, but I was also interested in

                     enterprise wide (POL) risk.


            36       I recall attending meetings of ARC, the RCC and Pensions Committee. I have

                     been reminded by document [POL00184703] that I was also a member of the

                     Mutualisation Committee.

            37       I have been asked if I considered POL's corporate governance to be effective

                     when I joined the business: I did, and this view did not change at any time. The

                     Board had a broad range of business and commercial, together with civil

                     service and government, experience. The ShEx NED (Susannah Storey

                     followed by Richard Callard in 2014, during my tenure) attended every Board

                     meeting and so there was in effect direct oversight from the Shareholder (the

                     government), which further enhanced the corporate governance of the

                     company, in contrast to a private company. Further, post-separation, there was

                     a sense of a new common purpose and eager anticipation within the POL

                     Board. There was strong enthusiasm and engagement from all directors,

                     particularly the NEDs. The NEDs were proactive and their challenges to the

                     executive directors were frequent, rigorous and thorough.


            V.       KNOWLEDGE OF HORIZON


            38       When I first joined POL, I had no prior knowledge of the Horizon IT System. I

                     cannot recall specifically, but I know I would have been briefed by Mr Ismay

                     and/or his team about the Horizon IT System during my induction period, as I

                     was briefed by all my direct reports in my first month. I did not have any formal

                     training on the Horizon IT System, however, I visited both Crowns and Network

                     branches early in my tenure and watched Crown employees using the Horizon

                     IT System to input transactions. As CFO, I was expected to have a general

                     understanding of how POL accounts for transactions in branches and by

                     product type, for the purpose ultimately of ensuring the reliability of POL's

                     financial statements. Therefore, that was the extent of my knowledge of the

                     Horizon IT System.

            39       I have reviewed [POL00294836] and [POL00294837], which shows that in

                     September 2011, Mr Ismay forwarded me a copy of a report he had written for

                     David Smith (POL Managing Director) in August 2010 (the "Ismay Report"). I

                     am sure that I read this report and spoke to Mr Ismay about it, but I cannot recall

                     this specifically. I cannot remember when I first became aware that there had

                     been some complaints and/or concerns raised by a number of subpostmasters

                     ("SPMs") and the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance ("JFSA") about the

                     integrity of the Horizon IT System, but I certainly would have been aware of this

                     after reading the Ismay Report. However, as the Ismay Report says, at the time,

                     these complaints were believed by POL to be unfounded. I do not know what,

                     if anything, the Ismay Report was being used for when I joined POL. I do not

                     recall any discussions with Mr Ismay or anyone on the Board or ExCo about

                     the Ismay Report.


            40       I have been asked to describe the extent to which, if at all, I was aware of (i)

                     bugs, errors or defects in the Horizon IT system ('BEDs"); (ii) a lack of integrity

                     in the Horizon IT system; or (iii) complaints addressing BEDs or concerns with

                     integrity.


            41       The term 'BEDs' is extremely broad. I was, and am, aware that most large-scale

                     IT systems will have some degree of glitches, bugs and anomalies that will need

                     to be resolved from time to time. For example, I note that the Ismay Report does

                     refer to some 'bugs' within the Horizon IT System. I cannot recall my reaction

                     to this information, but I believe that I would have seen these as standard minor

                     bugs that are present in most large computing systems.

            42       The Second Sight Interim Report of 2013 [POL00099063] reported two

                     `defects' in Horizon online referred to as the "Receipts and Payments Mismatch

                     Problem" and the "Local Suspense Account Problem" (para. 6.4 of the Second

                     Sight Interim Report). I was not aware of these defects until I read this report.


            43       I have been asked to describe my knowledge of the ability of Fujitsu employees

                     to alter transaction data or data in branch accounts without the knowledge or

                     consent of SPMs: I do not recall having this knowledge at any point during my

                     time at POL.


            VI.      POL'S PROSECUTORIAL FUNCTION


            44       I have been asked to set out what I knew of POL's role in prosecuting SPMs for

                     theft, false accounting and for offences under the Fraud Act 2006 when I was

                     appointed to the role of CFO. I did not know anything about POL's prosecution

                     activities before I joined the company. I believe POL's prosecution policy would

                     have been explained to me, in general terms, shortly after I joined, likely during

                     my induction. I was aware that POL suffered losses due to theft of money by

                     some SPMs and accordingly POL prosecuted these individuals and/or took civil

                     action against them to recover losses. However, POL's prosecution/civil

                     litigation policy was not a function that came within my remit or responsibilities

                     as CFO.


            45       I do not recall discussions of any individual cases at Board level. I do not recall

                     any discussions within ARC of POL's prosecutorial activities or policy until late

                     2013 when Chris Aujard (General Counsel) proposed amending the

                     prosecution policy (see para. 93 below).

            46       I have been shown [POL00100003] which is a document prepared for the

                     Board by Mr Aujard dated 6 December 2013 titled `Project Sparrow â€” Update'.

                     The document contains an Annex setting out 'prosecution numbers by date'

                     between 2009 and 2013. I do not recall this document or seeing data on the

                     number of prosecutions carried out by POL against SPMs before this date. I

                     believe that up until this point (2013), I had no understanding of the scale or

                     number of prosecutions carried out by POL.


            47       I have been asked to describe what steps I took as a member of the RCC to

                     satisfy myself that POL acted in compliance with its legal obligations in bringing

                     prosecutions and civil proceedings against SPMs, and whether I believe these

                     steps were adequate and/or effective. I do not recall any discussions within the

                     RCC about POL's prosecutions/civil action against SPMs.


            VII.     POL'S APPROACH TO THE PRESS


            48       I have been asked to consider [POL00294973] which is an email chain (dated

                     28 September 2011) I was copied into regarding POL's proposed response to

                     an article by Private Eye which challenged the reliability of the Horizon IT

                     System. I have been asked specifically to consider the statement by Ms

                     Vennells that "we need to be front foot and counter anything that has a

                     reputational impact. It's a goal of mine that al/ press even local press (perhaps

                     asp local press), should be scoured for negative comments and refuted".


            49       I do not recall reviewing this email chain or the Private Eye article. However,

                     this quote is typical of Ms Vennells' response to challenges to POL generally in

                     the press at the time. I had no reason to question this approach, particularly

                     when Ms Vennells had deeper knowledge and expertise about the SPM

                     network, having previously served as Post Office Network Director within RMG.

                     External media and communications also did not fall within my role as CFO and

                     there was a dedicated team, reporting to the CEO, tasked with this function.


            VIII.    The ERNST & YOUNG ("EY") 2010/11 AUDIT


            50       The EY 2010/11 audit was carried out and finalised before I arrived at POL in

                     August 2011 (POL's year end was the end of March). I recall reading the

                     management letter and meeting with the audit partner, Angus Grant, shortly

                     after I joined POL to discuss the key findings. I recall the conversation with Mr

                     Grant to be positive.


            51       I have been asked to describe my views on EY's findings in relation to the

                     Horizon IT System, Fujitsu's audit controls and POL's contractual relationship

                     with Fujitsu. I have also been asked to describe my understanding of the

                     importance of the audit controls described and EY's recommendation for a

                     SAS70 audit.


            52       I have refreshed my memory of the audit by reviewing [POL00030217], the

                     draft EY management letter for the year ended 27 March 2011 (1 have not been

                     provided with a final version of this letter). I note that the letter highlighted a

                     series of recommendations primarily around improving the IT governance and

                     control environment. EY acknowledged the very substantial financial benefits

                     that POL had enjoyed from deploying the outsourcing model, but recommended

                     that POL should "take ownership of the effectiveness of the control environment

                     with Fujitsu" and if possible keep alive the option of requiring Fujitsu to provide

                     an ISAE 3402 (previously SAS70) assurance report. The primary purpose of

                     this, as expressed by EY, would be to assist and simplify future audits by


                                                         Page 16 of 49
                                                                                                     WITN10000100
                                                                                                   WI TN10000100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 81AFC40A-7FC9-42E3-966B-320BE0F2480F




                     reducing the amount of compensating testing currently undertaken within the

                     core audit in order for EY to take assurance on the quality of IT general controls

                     around POL's critical business systems.


            53       At the time, my view was that, while none of these observations gave rise to a

                     potentially qualified audit, they would need to be addressed over the coming

                     year.


            54       I did not â€” and still do not - see any of these recommendations as suggesting

                     fundamental or systemic weaknesses within the Horizon IT System. As EY

                     stated, "the recommendations we have made in this report should be seen as

                     refinements rather than fundamental control deficiencies" The weaknesses

                     identified by EY within the controls environment were small scale and EY did

                     not suggest that these could lead to a qualified audit. EY's recommendation

                     that Fujitsu should be required to carry out a SAS70 audit was motivated by

                     efficiency rather than any suspected systemic or performance issues within the

                     Horizon IT System. EY's rationale was that it was not efficient for EY to be

                     carrying out controls testing on Fujitsu's system.


            55       I have been asked to describe the steps POL took in response to EY's findings,

                     and to what extent cost factored into POL's decision making.


            56       I have reviewed the minutes of the POL Board meeting on 22 September 2011

                     [POL00030365] which show that I reported to the POL Board that we were

                     exploring the possibility of requesting Fujitsu to undertake a SAS70 (or

                     equivalent) audit. I have been shown [POL00143065] which is a briefing report

                     prepared by Ms Sewell dated May 2012. The paper reported that "Post Office

                     have worked with Fujitsu and EY to agree an initial way forward where Fujitsu,


                                                         Page 17 of 49
                                                                                                    WITN10000100
                                                                                                  WI TN10000100

                     at their own cost, engage EY to produce such a report for the Fujitsu hosted

                     Post Office systems within the scope of our annual IT General Controls audit".

                     The report says that the Fujitsu ISAE 3402 report will be introduced for FY

                     2012/13.


            57       While I cannot recall the exact chronology of the negotiations with Fujitsu about

                     undertaking their own SAS70 / ISAE 3402 audit (as these were IT specific

                     recommendations, the negotiations would have been led by Mike Young, then

                     Ms Sewell), my view from reading the documents referenced above is that we

                     took proportionate and effective steps to address EY's recommendations and

                     obtain the appropriate assurance certification from Fujitsu.


            58       I note the comment in the minutes for the Board Meeting dated 22 September

                     2011 that "the business needed to be influenced by the cost as to which route

                     was pursued". I do not believe cost was the primary consideration in our

                     approach to carrying out a SAS70 audit. Rather, we were led by the principle

                     that Fujitsu should lead on the audit because they had ownership of the Horizon

                     IT System. We did not think it was appropriate or wise to instruct a third party

                     to undertake the audit without Fujitsu's input. With that in mind, we found it

                     difficult to justify a significant expense (E100,000 or more) for a third party

                     SAS70 or equivalent audit report when we believed Fujitsu should have taken

                     responsibility for this, which they ultimately did.


            59       I have been asked to comment on the background to the RMG ARC Committee

                     seeking input on "IT controls and the Horizon claims" [POL00295091] (email

                     dated 30 November 2011 from Ms Hall) and what I reported to the RMG ARC

                     Committee. I do not recall this request or the background to it, but I believe it

                     may have been a response to media attention surrounding the Private Eye

                     article [POL00294973]. I have been shown a paper drafted in my name titled

                     'Update on Post Office Limited Horizon Controls and Relationship with Fujitsu'

                     dated December 2011 [POL00295092] for the RMG ARC. I have reviewed

                     [POL00378693], an email from Ms Hall dated 30 November 2011. I believe,

                     after reviewing these documents, that Ms Hall and Mr Ismay drafted this paper,

                     with limited input from me, given I had been at POL for only four months at this

                     point. I believe the paper is in my name because I have attended the earlier

                     RMG ARC meeting and therefore the action would have been in my name.

                     However, I cannot recall with any certainty. I cannot recall how I satisfied myself

                     that the paper was accurate, but I believe that I would have been led by Ms Hall

                     and Mr Ismay given their greater experience in this area relative to my own at

                     the time.


            60       I have been asked to describe the background and function of the IT Audit &

                     Control Board. I am not aware of the IT Audit & Control Board and cannot recall

                     its existence, background or functions. I can see from the minutes of the Board

                     Meeting dated 4 July 2011 [POL00021500] that the Board tasks the IT Audit &

                     Control Board to pick up issues and actions arising from the SAS70 audit,

                     including Horizon issues. However, I note that I was not on the Board (or indeed

                     at POL) when this meeting took place.


            61       I have been asked to consider the minutes of the POL Board meeting dated 12

                     January 2012 [POL00021503], particularly the comment at POLB12/03(c) "The

                     Chairman emphasised the need for the IT Board paper to be clear with practical

                     ground. Paula Vennelis suggested that the Board might benefit from an IT deep

                     dive". I recall this discussion as relating to POL's IT Transformation Programme

                     and Ms Sewell's plans to re-configure the entire IT estate to better address the

                     future demands of POL's business strategy as an independent entity. I recall

                     the Board being concerned about the scale of the proposals, which led to Ms

                     Vennells' comment about doing a "deep dive"first.


            62       I have been asked to comment on the discussion minuted at POLB12/07 from

                     the same meeting on 12 January 2012. 1 have no recollection of the discussion

                     in this section of the minutes. I do not know which "audit report" Ms Crichton

                     was referring to, or why she suggested that it be given the status of legal

                     professional privilege before circulating it to the Board.


            IX.      SHOOSMITHS LITIGATION


            63       I do not recall having any involvement in POL's response to the litigation

                     initiated by claimants represented by Shoosmiths/Access Legal. I do not recall

                     any specific discussions with any of my direct reports or with the Board about

                     this   litigation.   I   would     have     read    the   Significant   Litigation   Report

                     [POL00096033] in preparation for the POL Board meeting of 15 March 2012

                     [UKG100016088], but I have no recollection of the POL Board discussing any

                     litigation at that meeting. I can see that it appeared as a noting paper under

                     AOB and is minuted as `noted' only. I therefore think it is unlikely that any

                     discussion of this paper took place at that Board meeting.

            64       I will now discuss my recollections of the background to the Second Sight

                     Interim Report dated 8 July 2013 (the "Interim Report").


                     A.       Second Sight's instructions


            65       My recollections of the background to the instruction of Second Sight's

                     independent review in 2012 are limited. I recall that the Second Sight review

                     was seen as an extremely important initiative. However, because of the

                     sensitivity of its subject matter the review was carefully managed as a distinct,

                     stand-alone project with participation limited to a very small number of POL

                     senior executives/Board members.


            66       I do not recall who took the decision to appoint Second Sight, the ambit of its

                     investigation or the extent of its access to relevant information and documents.

                     I do not believe I was directly involved in their instructions or management.


            67       I have been shown [POL00381632] which is an email dated 29 August 2013

                     from myself to Ms Perkins, which says "I have discussed this with Susan and

                     asked her to negotiate a monthly cap of Â£25k with SS (their monthly costs for

                     the interim report ranged from Â£25k-Â£43k)." I do not recall this email but I

                     understand from its contents that I was involved in discussing Second Sight's

                     costs with the General Counsel.


                     B.      Updates before receiving Second Sight's Interim Report


            68       I have been shown the following Board meeting minutes: [POL00027553] (21

                     November 2012), [POL00021510] (23 January 2013) and [POL00021515] (1

                     July 2013) which summarise updates on Second Sight's reviews to the Board.

                     I remember that the Board did have discussions about Second Sight's review,

                     but I do not recall the specific contents of these updates in any detail, except

                     insofar as discussed in para. 70 below.


            69       I have been asked to set out my recollection of the Board meeting on 1 July

                     2013. I have been shown the minutes from this meeting [POL00021515]. I

                     recall that the Board was reassured by the CEO's update, which was that the

                     investigation to date had found no systemic issues within the Horizon IT system.

                     I recall that the Board's main concerns related to the form and style of the report.



            70       I have been shown an email from Ms Vennells dated 4 July 2013 to the Board

                     (with me in copy) titled `Second Sight update 4/7/13' [POL00145189]. Ms

                     Vennells said "we understand that they [Second Sight] have not found any

                     evidence of systemic issues with the Horizon system [..] However, as expected,

                     they do intend to draw attention to wider failings in the training and support

                     provided to sub-postmasters, with the implication that this was the root-cause

                     of some of the problems related to Horizon". Ms Vennells also noted that the

                     introductory sections of the report "give some cause for concern in relation to

                     the overall professionalism of the drafting and the widespread use of subjective

                     (and at times somewhat emotional) statements of opinion rather than more

                     neutral or evidence-based insight". I do not recall receiving this email, but this

                     is consistent with my recollections of the tone of the updates we received prior

                     to receiving the Interim Report - that no systemic issues with the Horizon IT

                     System had been identified, but there had been some failings in the way that

                     POL had trained and supported SPMs, and that the tone and style of Second

                     Sight's drafting was at times anecdotal and emotional.

            71       I do not recall being involved with reading or seeking amendments to drafts of

                     the Interim Report. I do not recall meeting with any Second Sight

                     representatives at any point and I do not recall being shown any early drafts of

                     the Interim Report. I also do not recall being asked to provide any input into

                     amendments on the Report requested by POL, as referred to in Paula Vennells'

                     email of 6 July 2013 [POL00099121].


                     C.      Receipt of Second Sight's Interim Report


            72       On first reading the Interim Report, I recall thinking it was poorly written and I

                     was surprised at the strength of its criticism of POL, particularly in relation to

                     the lack of support provided to SPMs.


            73       I also recall not being aware of the two "known" Horizon anomalies that had

                     been identified and disclosed to Second Sight. I had not been made aware of

                     these anomalies before. I understood, from the Interim Report, that they were

                     historic and had been resolved without any detriment to SPMs.


            74       On the four more substantive points (Spot Reviews SR01, SR05, SR21 and

                     SR22), I understood that the issues identified were far from being resolved and

                     more work was required by POL and Second Sight to reach final, definitive

                     conclusions and recommendations.


            75       I do not recall any discussions by the Board specifically about financial and

                     reputational risks arising from the Interim Report. I have seen Ms Vennells'

                     email dated 6 July 2013 [POL00099121] where, prior to publication of the

                     Interim Report, she identified "one of the main reputational and potentially

                     financial risks arising from the review relates to possible attempts to reopen

                                                                                                  WITN10000100

                     past prosecutions based on the findings". I do not remember this being

                     discussed by the Board but I do not believe this was a significant financial

                     concern. My recollection is that we believed only a small number of historic

                     cases would be affected, leading to a limited number of possible compensation

                     claims, which, from a POL financial reporting perspective, would be immaterial

                     in quantum.


                     D.      Engagement with MPs about the Interim Report


            76       As a member of the POL Board I was aware of upcoming meetings with MPs

                     attended by the CEO and/or the Chair, and on occasion, the Company

                     Secretary. The outcome of these meetings would generally be reported at

                     Board meetings. I would have taken part in Board discussions to agree the

                     strategy being adopted in response to the questions or complaints of MPs. For

                     the most part, I was simply sent briefs or kept updated on meetings with MPs â€”

                     such as in [POL00297091] where, on 3 July 2013, Martin Edwards (Chief of

                     Staff) forwarded a briefing note for Ms Vennells' upcoming meeting with James

                     Arbuthnot MP to "keep [us] in the loop". However, I did not personally ever

                     engage with any MPs or ministers. I was also generally not involved in

                     preparing briefings for these meetings on (i) the Horizon IT System; (ii) POL's

                     treatment of SPMs in connection with the same; or (iii) the Second Sight review

            77       I have been asked to comment on the POL Board meeting on 16 July 2013

                     [POL00021516]. I recall this particular Board meeting with surprising clarity

                     (given the passage of time), in light of the tone and contents of the meeting, as

                     discussed further below.


            78       I recall that at the start of the meeting we discussed the Board Effectiveness

                     Review. This was a general review of the Board's activities and its effectiveness

                     over the preceding year. I have been shown the Board Effectiveness Review

                     report authored by Alice Perkins, dated July 2013 [POL00099166], which was

                     discussed at the meeting. Feedback was given as part of the review, for

                     example `'the Chairman to sum up discussions even more clearly'. I believe the

                     comment "The Board also asked for earlier warning when risks and issues arise

                     to ensure that they were not blindsided" was another piece of feedback as part

                     of the Board Effectiveness Review - I note it is written in the section of the

                     minute titled `Board Effectiveness Review'. I do not believe this comment had

                     any connection with the Interim Report or the Horizon IT System.


            79       When the Board discussed the Interim Report, I remember feeling a sense of

                     unease that events had moved rapidly and unexpectedly since its publication. I

                     had just returned from annual leave (I was away between 5 and 15 July 2013)

                     and I recall noticing the change in tone at this Board meeting versus the one I

                     attended before I went away (1 July 2013).


            80       I do not recall who made the comment that led to the minute "The Board were

                     concerned that the review had opened the Business up to claims of wrongful

                     prosecution". I do not recall what the specific basis for this concern was.

            81       I recall that at this meeting the Board was concerned, in particular that: the

                     review was taking longer and costing more than expected, it was still

                     inconclusive, and possible `scope creep' might result in further delays and cost

                     increases. I recall questions being asked at this meeting about how the contract

                     with Second Sight had been awarded and managed and a short discussion on

                     POL's failure to provide requisite material to Second Sight. This contributed to

                     the comment in the Board minutes that the review had not been managed well

                     by the business.


            82       I have been asked what effect, if any, did the Board's challenges at this meeting

                     have on POL's approach to the Second Sight review â€” I do not know. I do not

                     recall whether we discussed at this meeting how Second Sight's review should

                     progress going forward.


                     B.      Project Sparrow


            83       I do not believe I had any personal involvement in the establishment of Project

                     Sparrow. I have no recollection or knowledge of how Project Sparrow was set

                     up, or of its Terms of Reference or membership. I believe I had an oversight

                     role only, as part of the Board, and received regular progress updates, such as

                     the Horizon update paper sent to the Board on 18 September 2013

                     [POL00027134].


            84       I have been reminded by [POL00021516] that I was asked to review POL and

                     RMG's insurance policies in light of the findings in the Second Sight Interim

                     Report.

            85       I have been shown the following legal advice provided to POL:


            85.1     [POL00006798] (Simon Clarke's advice of 15 July 2013);


            85.2     [POL00006799] (Simon Clarke's advice of 2 August 2013);


            85.3     [POL00006583] (Brian Altman KC's advice of 2 August 2013); and


            85.4     [POL00006581] (Brian Altman KC's advice of 15 October 2013).


                     (together, the "Advice")


            86       I have no recollection of reading any of the Advice. I do not recall any specific

                     discussions by the Board or briefings to the Board about any of the Advice.


            87       I have been asked whether I had any prior knowledge of the factual allegations

                     set out in paragraphs 3 and 5 of the Simon Clarke advice dated 2 August 2013

                     [POL00006799]. I did not.


                     D.       The establishment and oversight of the Initial Complaint Review and

                     Mediation Scheme (the "Mediation Scheme")


            88       I understood at the time that the objective and purpose of the Mediation

                     Scheme was to identify any SPMs who might have claims against POL arising

                     from the matters in the Interim Report. I can see from the Linklaters' advice

                     dated 20 March 2014 [POL00107317] (discussed further in para. 96 below) that

                     the Scheme had "the aim of resolving various allegations that had by then been

                     made by certain interested parties about the Horizon financial transaction and

                     accounting system" I have been shown the briefing note to the Board on

                     Project Sparrow dated 18 September 2013 [POL00027134]. I could not recall

                     from memory, but I can see from [POL00027134] that the Mediation Scheme

                     was launched on 27 August 2013 and initially intended to run until 31 March

                     2014. A Working Group (comprising of representatives from POL, Second Sight

                     and JFSA) was set up to review applications submitted to the Mediation

                     Scheme.


            89       I have been asked about my involvement in the Mediation Scheme. I believe

                     that my only substantive role in the Mediation Scheme beyond my

                     supervisory/oversight role as a Board member, was to: (i) potentially deputise,

                     if needed, for Ms Vennells; (ii) advise on insurance cover for compensation

                     claims (as I was reminded from [POL00021516] â€” minutes for Board meeting

                     held on 16 July 2013); and (iii) report on the costs of the Mediation Scheme (as

                     I was reminded from [POL00027400] â€” minutes for Board meeting held on 21

                     May 2014). Otherwise, I played no operational or management part in the

                     establishment or running of the Mediation Scheme. I was not involved in

                     determining POL's methodology for responding to applicants in the Mediation

                     Scheme. I do not recall being aware of the role that Second Sight would play in

                     the Mediation Scheme or what their updated contractual terms were, although

                     as discussed in paragraph 67 above, I have seen that I was involved in internal

                     discussions about Second Sight's costs.


            90       I have been asked if I recall the context to the minute of the Board meeting held

                     on 21 January 2014 [POL00021521] saying "if the Terms of Reference agreed

                     with Second Sight precluded them from working with claimants against the Post

                     Office". I do not.

            91       I have been asked to set out the extent to which the Board was briefed on, or

                     maintained oversight of, POL's response to applications to the Mediation

                     Scheme. I have been shown a number of documents which show that the Board

                     was regularly updated on the number of submissions received, which grew

                     rapidly     to   levels   considerably      higher than   originally   projected   (see

                     [POL00027136] (CEO report on 24 October 2013), [POL00021519] (minutes

                     for Board meeting held on 31 October 2013), [POL00026626] (Board agenda

                     and papers for meeting of 27 November 2013), [POL00099977] (briefing

                     document by Mr Aujard and Ms Crowe (undated)) and [POL00027400]

                     (minutes for Board meeting held on 21 May 2014)). I do not recall how qualified

                     or detailed these updates to the Board were, beyond what is stated in the

                     aforementioned documents.


            92       I do recall ExCo becoming more engaged and better briefed on the Mediation

                     Scheme from late 2013 onwards. I have been shown a note of the meeting of

                     the RCC on 20 January 2014 [POL00027479] in which `Integrity of Horizon

                     System' was listed as an agenda item: "it was agreed that, whilst this is more

                     of an issue than a risk, the progress on managing Sparrow would continue to

                     be reported to the committee'. I do not recall this specific meeting, but having

                     reviewed this document I believe ExCo took a more involved role in the

                     Mediation Scheme at this point.


                     E.        Amendments to POL's prosecutorial policy


            93       As CFO, I was not close to the details of any specific prosecutions POL was

                     pursuing, and nor did I ever significantly engage with POL's prosecution policy

                     except as described in the para. below.

            94       I can see from documents I have been shown that I was involved in discussions

                     at Board, ARC and ExCo meetings in late 2013 and early 2014 with regard to

                     changes to POL's prosecutorial policy â€” see for example [POL00038678]

                     (minutes of the ARC meeting of 19 November 2013), [POL00027692] (email

                     chain dated 10 February 2014), [POL00021424] (minutes of ARC meeting of

                     11 February 2014), and [POL00027337] (minutes of Board meeting held on 26

                     February 2014).


            95       I did not have any strong views on the issue, but I was persuaded by MrAujard's

                     Prosecution Policy paper dated February 2014 [POL00100193]. Looking at the

                     paper again, now I can recall that I agreed with the proposal to pursue a

                     prosecutions policy with a much greater focus on higher value cases involving

                     wilful wrongdoing, possibly by setting a financial filter/threshold level for

                     prosecutions in order to reduce the estimated average annual number of

                     prosecutions. I believe I also agreed with the Board position that "any

                     communication regarding the changes in approach to prosecutions should be

                     reactive" (POLB 14/17(c) in [POL00027337]), because publication of the

                     thresholds to prosecution might limit the policy's deterrent effect.


            XII.     LINKLATERS' ADVICE AND THE PROJECT SPARROW SUBCOMMITTEE


                     A.       Commissioning of Linklaters'advice


            96       I have been asked to comment on the discussion that led to the minute of the

                     26 February 2014 Board meeting stating "it was acknowledged that, in light of

                     the facts now available, and the projected level of legal claims and costs, it

                     would be sensible to commission more generic legal advice on the overall level

                     of legal and financial exposure... This advice should consider the steps that


                                                         Page 30 of 49
                                                                                                          WITN10000100
                                                                                                        WI TN10000100

                     could be taken to mitigate any exposure including considerations of alternative

                     structures     that might be            available   to   deal   with mediation   cases"

                     [POL00027337]. Up until this point, the Working Group and its advisors had

                     been looking at the cases submitted individually, which was inefficient from both

                     a process and cost perspective. I recall, for example, discussion that one single

                     case might require several layers of legal advice. The Board thought that a

                     holistic view of all the cases submitted to the Mediation Scheme needed to be

                     taken in order to understand the themes and legal issues at a macro level. I

                     recall that this discussion was about seeking advice on the cases submitted to

                     the Mediation Scheme as a whole.


            97       To be clear, from my recollections, the purpose of seeking legal advice was not

                     to try and limit the Mediation Scheme or reduce the size of compensation

                     payments.


            98       I do not recall having any personal involvement in the instruction of Linklaters.

                     I recall Linklaters attending the Board meeting on 26 March 2014

                     [POL00021523] and advising the Board on the legal basis for which SPMs

                     might be able to claim compensation from POL. I cannot recall anything else

                     from this Board meeting, but I can see from these minutes that I was asked to

                     advise on POL's insurance cover for any such claims.


                     B.      Project Sparrow Subcommittee


            99       I have been asked to explain the background to and reasons why Project

                     Sparrow became a formal subcommittee of the Board.

DocuSign Envelope ID: 81AFC40A-7FC9-42E3-966B-320BE0F2480F




            100      I can see from the POL Board minutes dated 26 March 2014 [POL00021523]

                     that following receipt of the Linklaters advice, the Project Sparrow

                     Subcommittee was set up.


            101      Having reviewed [POL00021523], I can now recall that the Project Sparrow

                     Subcommittee was formed to reflect the importance of Project Sparrow, the

                     number and size of claims that had been received by the Mediation Scheme,

                     and observations/findings made by Linklaters in their advice. In particular, the

                     criticism by Linklaters of Second Sight's work on the Mediation Scheme to date.

                     Having read [POL00021523], I can see that criticism had also been levied at

                     Second Sight by Sir Anthony Hooper, Chair of the Working Group. I believe that

                     the Board, particularly the NEDs, felt a need to be closer to the details of the

                     Mediation Scheme, rather than receiving periodic updates from the Executive.

                     This is reflected in the composition of the Project Sparrow Subcommittee

                     (comprising Chair, CEO and at least two NEDs with all other NEDs invited to

                     attend if available).


            102      I attended the first Project Sparrow Subcommittee meeting of 9 April 2014.

                     However, because the core Board representation was considered sufficient and

                     because of my heavy operational workload, I did not attend any subsequent

                     meetings. I continued to receive minutes, and quite possibly less formal

                     updates.


            XIII.    PROJECT ZEBRA


            103      I have been asked to describe the extent of my knowledge of and involvement

                     with the instruction of Deloitte and Project Zebra in 2014.

            104      I do not have any detailed independent recollections, but having been shown

                     [POL00021523], I am of the belief that Project Zebra was established, and

                     Deloitte instructed, for the following reasons: the Board was reassured by the

                     clarity of the Linklaters' report on the legal position (that "absent proof that

                     Horizon is malfunctioning (either generally or in the specific case) the Post

                     Office has a right to recover losses from SPMRs, the SPMRs have no right to

                     compensation for such losses and the circumstances in which there will be a

                     consequential loss claim are limited to those in which inadequate notice of

                     termination was given, will depend on their facts and should be limited'

                     [POL00107317], para. 1.8). However, the Board was concerned about the

                     following comment: "It is the reliability of the Horizon system as a matter of

                     principle which is important....Second Sight have not done what we would have

                     expected them to do in terms of an investigation into Horizon.. .[they] should

                     have produced a report which clearly and objectively sets out what is known

                     about Horizon at a level of detail which can then be used as a baseline in any

                     individual case where the complaint is that Horizon was not working properly"

                     ([POL00107317], para. 5.30-5.31). This is also reflected in [POL00107317]

                     para. 2.3, "we note that there is, so far as we understand it, no objective report

                     which describes and addresses the use and reliability of Horizon".


            105      I do not recall the discussions in the meeting of the POL Board on 26 March

                     2014, but I believe the above is what motivated the Board to immediately decide

                     to commission the Project Zebra review by Deloitte into the reliability of Horizon.

                     We intended that this would dove-tail with Linklaters' advice on the legal

                     position. I recall that I was supportive of this course of action, but I was not

                     involved in the instruction of Deloitte or the establishment of Project Zebra.

            106      I do not recall any discussions in Board meetings, except in the meeting on 30

                     April 2014 (discussed in para. 108 below), on Deloitte's reports. I do not recall

                     any discussions about the scope of Deloitte's work, any caveats they would

                     make, or their terms of reference.


            107      My recollections of the 30 April 2014 Board meeting are limited, but I do

                     remember Deloitte attending the meeting. I can see from the minutes of that

                     meeting [POL00021524] that Deloitte's draft findings were discussed and the

                     Board was assured that their "work to date showed that the system had strong

                     areas of control and that its testing and implementation were in line with best

                     practice. Work was still needed to assure the controls and access at the

                     Finance Service Centre" (POLB 14/55).


            108      On receipt of Deloitte's reports ('Horizon Desktop Review of Assurance

                     [POL00028069] (note, I have not been shown final versions of either of these

                     reports)) I can recall a sense of general disappointment by the Board. I cannot

                     recall my views at the time, but looking at it now I think that Deloitte's report

                     was far too caveated and failed to reach any definitive conclusions on the

                     reliability of the Horizon IT System.


            XIV.     AMENDMENTS TO THE MEDIATION SCHEME


            109      I have been asked to explain whether, and to what extent, did the Board apply

                     pressure to limit the scope of the Mediation Scheme and/or POL's approach to

                     it because of costs concerns. I do not recall any pressure being applied by the

                     Board to limit the scope of the Mediation Scheme specifically because of cost

                     concerns. At the start of the Scheme, the Board believed that the level of

                     compensation to be paid out would be relatively small â€” we believed the claims

                     would mostly be for issues relating to the processes adopted by POL in relation

                     to its treatment of SPMs (e.g. poor support when SPMs encountered technical

                     issues). However, by February 2014, the projected level of legal claims and

                     costs had escalated greatly. This was a concern to the Board, but my

                     recollection is that we wished to reach a point of certainty at which the final

                     number of cases and the related quantum of legal/compensation costs involved

                     could be known. The Board certainly did not wish to cut corners in order to keep

                     costs low.


            110      I do not recall discussions on amendments to the Mediation Scheme, but I do

                     remember receiving and reading the briefing pack for the first meeting of the

                     Sparrow Subcommittee which includes a document about `Options for the

                     future of the Scheme' ([POL00202734], dated 9 April 2014).


            111      I was not present at the Project Sparrow Subcommittee meeting of 30 April

                     2014 at which it was agreed "that, subject to a satisfactory outcome from the

                     Deloitte assurance assessment, the Programme Team should develop an

                     implementation plan.. .to continue to investigate cases but bring it within the

                     control of the Post Office" (PS 14/13) [POL00006566].


            112      I do recall the Board meeting of 10 June 2014 at which consideration of several

                     options culminated in a decision to not move governance of the Mediation

                     Scheme in-house. We decided instead to "continue with the Scheme but seek

                     to refine its work within the existing Terms of Reference" (POLB 14/85(c)),

                     subject to taking legal advice on the risks inherent with the changes proposed

                     [POL00021526]. I recall that the Board was concerned that such changes may

                     look like POL was trying to shut down the Mediation Scheme and suppress

                     claims. I believe this was the primary consideration in deciding against bringing

                     the Mediation Scheme in-house.


            XV.      SECOND SIGHT - 2014


                     A.       My observations on Second Sight's Briefing Reports


            113      I have been asked to describe my views at the time on the Second Sight briefing

                     reports. It is difficult now to distinguish my views between the two reports,

                     however, in aggregate, I recall thinking that they were of poor quality, contained

                     largely anecdotal evidence and were inconclusive in their findings.


                     B.       My involvement in POL's response to the Briefing Reports


            114      I have been asked to describe the nature and extent of my involvement in POL's

                     response to Second Sight's briefing reports. I was not personally involved in

                     drafting POL's response dated 22 September 2014 [POL00002415]. However,

                     I have been shown [POL00305585] and [POL00305595], which is an email

                     chain between Ms Crowe, Mr Edwards and myself on 8 August 2014, attaching

                     a draft letter to Second Sight regarding Briefing Report Part 2 [POL00305576].

                     I do not recall these emails but I can see that I was being asked to sign off on

                     the letter in MrAujard's absence. Ultimately, MrAujard asked if he could "long-

                     grass" the response until his return.


             115     I have been shown the draft letter in my name dated August 2014

                     [POL00022226]. I have also been shown an email chain between Linklaters,

                     Ms Crowe and MrAujard dated 26 August 2014 [POL00022231], in which Ms

                     Crowe attached the letter drafted by Jonathan Swill at Linklaters and forwarded

                     it to MrAujard. Ms Crowe said "Linklaters have drafted a letter for Second Sight

                     to enable us to begin to take clear steps to control their poor quality and

                     performance. Chris Day and Paula were (understandably keen to get

                     something on the record about costs. Chris was even minded to write himself.. ".

                     I am not copied on this email chain. I do not recall these emails or the draft

                     letter. I do not know if the letter was sent to Second Sight, however, I do not

                     believe I had any significant involvement in the drafting of this letter.


                     C.      Response to Second Sight on Suspense Accounts


            116      I have been asked to summarise the nature of the suspense accounts POL

                     operated during my time as CFO. I recall that POL's suspense accounts

                     operated in much the same way as other organisations I worked for: the

                     purpose of suspense accounts (and, specifically, POL's suspense accounts) is

                     to hold unidentified and/or disputed amounts pending final resolution of their

                     accounting treatment. POL's suspense account would have been routinely

                     reviewed by its external auditors, as misuse or misinterpretation could lead to

                     a misstatement of the true financial position of the business. Anything

                     anomalistic or material in the suspense accounts would have been queried by

                     the auditors. I do not recall ever discussing POL's suspense accounts with our

                     auditors.


            117      I do not recall being involved in preparing POL's response to Second Sight in

                     relation to POL's suspense accounts. I have been shown emails dated 18 â€” 20

                     June 2014 between Ron Warmington (Second Sight) and my direct reports (Mr

                     Ismay, Charles Colquhoun and Ms Hall) [POL00205881]. I was copied into the

                     first three emails of this chain so I would have been aware of some of these

                     discussions, but I do not recall them. I believe I would have appreciated the

                     importance and sensitive nature of the subject matter and reviewed the

                     contributions provided by my team.


            118      I have been shown [POL00022774] which is the paper submitted by Ms Crowe

                     on behalf of POL in response to Second Sight's question "Could any SPMRs

                     have been charged by Post Office Ltd for amounts that become incorporated in

                     suspense account balances that were subsequently taken into profit by POL or

                     any of its Counterparty Companies, or that remain as credit balances on the

                     balance sheet ofPOL or any of its Counterparty Companies?" I could not initially

                     recall the exact mechanism of POL's suspense accounts until reading this

                     document and Mr Ismay's email dated 7 July 2014 ([POL00148669]). However,

                     having read these documents, I agree with Mr Ismay's and Ms Crowe's

                     description of how POL's suspense accounts worked.


            119      I have been asked to explain how POL or I satisfied ourselves that any

                     surpluses in the suspense accounts were not derived from the recovery of false

                     shortfalls generated by the Horizon IT system. As we did not believe that the

                     Horizon IT System generated any false shortfalls, we did not take any particular

                     steps in this regard. I refer again to the fact that the suspense accounts were

                     reviewed by our external auditors.

            120      I have been asked to describe the nature and extent of any involvement I had,

                     including discussions at Board meetings, on the following matters from 2 July

                     2014 to leaving POL in December 2014:



            120.1 POL's approach to the Mediation Scheme, including whether to amend it â€” I do

                     not recall any direct involvement in the Mediation Scheme nor any discussions

                     on amending the Mediation Scheme.


            120.2 The ambit of Second Sight's instruction, including whether it should be

                     terminated - I recall only short, limited Board discussions about Second Sight.

                     I do not recall the POL Board meeting of 25 September 2014 [POL00021528],

                     Having read this document, I recall now that the Board was disenchanted with

                     the quality of Second Sight's work and the related costs. However, I do not

                     recall whether the Board discussed terminating the instruction completely.


            120.3 POL's response to MPs, SPMs or journalists challenging the integrity of the

                     Horizon IT System - I had no involvement.


            GENERAL


            121      I have been asked to reflect on my time at POL and set out whether there is

                     anything I would have handled differently with hindsight, in relation to the

                     Horizon IT System and its associated issues.


            122      It is difficult to comment on what POL could have done differently in hindsight.

                     The POL Board understood that while there were, at times, minor issues with

                     the Horizon IT System, these were standard within a large computing system

                     and there were no systemic problems. All management decisions stemmed

                     from this continued belief and I believe the Board conducted itself properly in

                     light of that belief.
