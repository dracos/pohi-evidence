Hi Anthony

I think the meeting below is now in your diary —I think it would be worth you, me and Richard discussing beforehand,
so I'll find some time on Monday when Richard’s back in the office. I’m also very happy to talk through any
background etc in the meantime.

Thanks
Laura

Baroness Neville-Rolfe would like a high-level meeting on Post Office and issues surrounding the Horizon system, and
has asked that Mark Russell attends. Would he be available to attend the next catch-up from 1.30 to 2pm next
Tuesday 4°" August? Laura Thompson and Richard Callard will also attend, as well as Nick King, SoS Spad.

Thanks
