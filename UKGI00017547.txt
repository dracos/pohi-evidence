Please complete your questionnaire by 14 December 2018.

Most questions include a 1 - 5 scoring option (1 = requires significant development; 2 =
requires development; 3 = good/ at required standard; 4 = very good; 5 = excellent. There is
also a non applicable option where you can’t or do not think it appropriate to respond to a
question). Text boxes have been included at the end of each section for your general
comments but it would also be really helpful to include examples that link to any of the
questions in that section, especially if it’s an area where you think work is needed.

The timetable for the evaluation report and the Senior Independent Director’s meeting with
NEDs to discuss the Chairman’s performance is:

Date Action

addressed and monitored.

The report to the Board in January will also include the actions from the last Board evaluation

Please include any thoughts you have on the skills, experience, diversity and
knowledge represented by the Board collectively, including whether you think there
are any areas that need to be strengthened or gaps filled (whether currently, or as a
future requirement because of Post Office Limited's strategic direction).

The Board composition is very good and there is a very good mix of skills and experience.
The Board is diverse. It would be beneficial to have someone with operational experience in

franchising but I don’t think it’s essential.

Re timing of issues coming to the Board - see later comments.

In general I think Board members aren’t encouraged to contribute to a Board discussion.
Sometimes a contribution at Board level seems to happen more by intervention than
invitation. I'd encourage Tim to positively ask for contributions particularly from Board
members who have experience relevant to the topic being discussed.

Succession has not been discussed in the last 12 months. Obviously this has been

overtaken by events to some degree but talent management and succession at Group Exec
level is something the Board should discuss. Also there should be regular opportunities for
the Board to meet as a group without management present. I’m pleased that one has been
scheduled in January. Hopefully it’s the first of a regular series.

Please include any thoughts you have on the Board's decision-making processes.

The Board and management seems to have limited perspective or education about
competitors. When questions are asked (eg Ken’s recent question about Deutsche Post)
there seems to be limited follow up.

There are a lot of talented people on the Board who I believe could make a more significant
significant contribution to the decision making process. I believe the company would benefit
greatly if individual NEDs could be involved throughout the life of a decision, particularly
where they have expertise - helping management define the problem and identify the
alternatives to be evaluated, assist with designing the work and analysis needed to support
a decision, and making better informed contributions to the Board discussion itself

the Board with limited opportunity to discuss and evaluate alternatives. In relation to
commercial negotiations, there needs to be much clearer communication and agreement on
the negotiating parameters that management has the authority to agree. The usual position
is that economic objectives are unclear or stated by management as aspirations rather than
clear negotiating parameters and as a result management has too much freedom to
negotiate making it harder to hold them to account subsequently

I think the Board (and management) could do more here. I’m particularly interested in the
postmaster population - both multiples but also the large number of postmasters who seem
to have quite limited (at least physical) contact with the company. Hopefully this will come
into greater focus as a result of the new corporate governance code and the need for the
Board to have a stakeholder representative.
