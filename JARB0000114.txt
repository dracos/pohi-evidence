Dear James

Re: Mrs Josephine Hamilton

Thank you for your letter and enclosures of 12 March. I was away last week or would
have replied sooner.

We are in active discussions with the Post Office to seek to ensure that they retain all
relevant documents and I know that Sally Berlin has been taking a close personal
interest in this.

I hope this is of some reassurance.

Yours sincerely

Richard Foster
