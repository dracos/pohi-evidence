Transaction Correction/Debt Recovery Process

Background

The objective of Product and Branch Accounting (P&BA) is to balance the
ledgers between clients and Post Office® branches, in order to produce
accounts for clients and Post Office® Ltd that accurately reflect the
transactions that are conducted over our branch counters. If any
discrepancies are found during this process of matching the data, a
Transaction Correction is issued to the relevant Post Office® branch to rectify
the account. This usually has a financial impact on the branch, by either the
subpostmaster having to make good any shortfall in cash, or receiving a
credit for mistakes that have been identified.

If the Post Office® branch makes a mistake that cannot be identified and
linked to a client, i-e., too much change has been given to a customer, this
would result in a Branch Discrepancy which would be realised at Branch
Trading. The subpostmaster would be responsible for making good any
losses.

What is a transaction correction for?

1. Correct Horizon & POLFS from Client perspective — identified by non
matched POLFs data

2. Correct Horizon & POLFS for a Cash/Bureau REM discrep

3. Correct stock levels — either caused by remittance discrepancies or
branch adjustments

4. Correct Non Accounting data (not used currently)

5. Writing off value from Branch (exceptional circumstances only)

Transaction Correction identification and issue

This is covered within P&BA duty instructions. The document “Issuing
process for transaction corrections” (17/7/06) is held on the “P&BA public
drive: to be archived; open item management”.

Transaction Correction Disputes

Document under this heading v2.1 is held under the above file. (“P&BA public
drive: to be archived; open item management”.)

A further step within the dispute process has been agreed whereby
subpostmasters can further dispute a debt (branch discrepancy/transaction
correction by providing a written submission of evidence to the Branch
Analyst.

This process is summarised under T:Finance:Finance Product & Branch
Accounting:Finance P&BA Branch:Branch Analyst:Flag Cases:AW Dispute
Process.

Branch Process
This is documented within the branch trading operations manual section 7
page 9.

Debt Collection Process

This process has been varied from original documentation. It is not proposed
to fully document at this stage as a trial with Contracts managers concurrence
reports is underway at time of writing.

To summarise current practices there are two discrete approach’s.

Singleton branches
Statement of centrally settled debt to branches — week 1 (after branch

trading)

Reminder letter — week 3

2° reminder letter — week 4

Concurrence spreadsheet to Contracts Advisors — week 6

Contracts Advisors recover debt or agree deduction from remuneration —
week 6-8.

Agents debt team set up deductions from remuneration from next pay run.

National Multiple branches
Weekly transaction correction summary spreadsheet to each multiple head

office.

Monthly statement of account sent to each multiple head office — week 1.
Individual repayment terms agreed with each multiple partner.

Please note: The acceptance of a TC may still result in a dispute. Branch

Trading forces the acceptance of the TC on the Horizon system to enable the

kit to roll over.

The above process is effectively repeated if written submission is made
via the Branch Analyst. In those cases the debt is often at Contract
Manager stage and no system generated blocks occur — deduction from
remuneration is suspended.
