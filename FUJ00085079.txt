Symptoms

Counter alert raised

0904: Non Zero Local Suspense Branch Opening Figures are found for TP n

(possibly 2 identical events)

0908: The BTS branch discrepancy transferred totals do not match the branch discrepancy resolved totals

and/or
PM rings the Helpdesk to report seeing the error

MSG31332 Discrepancies Mismatch
Office Balancing Error. The discrepancies transferred and resolved do not match on branch rollover by User user to Trading Period n

Problem
Background in PCPC0223870. Two checks have been added to identify system errors when balancing.

a) The next TP's Opening Figures, generated for stock unit DEF, include Local Suspense products that don't net to zero value.
b) The sum of the two Discrepancy Transferred lines on the BTS, for the Branch Total, do not equal the sum of the two Discrepancy Resolved lines.

So 2 new system errors may be logged at error level, and two new deferred events. The new events will not appear on the counter event log report.
System errors:

0904.com. fujitsu.poa.ctre. businesslogic.reporting.nonZeroLocalSuspenseBranchOpeningFigures
0905.com.fujitsu.poa.ctrc.businesslogic.reporting. mismatchedBTSdiscrepancyTransferredandResolved

Event ids:

124 The branch local suspense opening figures for TP %TP% do not net to zero.

125 The BTS branch discrepancy transferred totals do not match the branch discrepancy resolved totals.

Solution - Helpdesk

If a branch reports seeing MSG31332, advise them to continue the rollover (they will not be able to do anything to fix the problem) and explain that it
will be investigated. Find out the date, time and node id being used. Check whether SMC have already raised a call, if so update it with the branch
info (using OTI Log Comment if already with Peak), otherwise send a P3 call to SSC, quoting this KEL.

Solution - SMC

Counter events with alert key 0904 or 0905:

Check whether MAC have had a call raised as a result of the branch phoning into ATOS SD, if so update it with the event details (using OT! Log
Comment if already with Peak), otherwise send 1 call per branch, P3, to SSC, including the event details and quoting this KEL.

Solution - 3LS

This should never happen - something has gone horribly wrong. Or possibly the checks haven't been implemented as intended.

0904: Note that the TP number in the event text is incorrect, look at the entries in BRDB_SU_OPENING_BALANCE for the next TP which the
branch was rolling into. The local suspense entries (prods 6294-6297) in DEF do not add up to zero. When we had a problem before, the root of the

problem was some old local suspense entries in BRDB_RX_BTS_DATA.

0905: The amount resolved (cleared from local suspense when last active stock unit rolled over) should always equal the amount transferred (put
into local suspense as each stock unit balanced). So check all local suspense movements/opening figures.

If there is a genuine problem, as well as addressing the root cause, POL will need to be informed and the effect on the branch accounts and POLFS.
will need to be investigated. To look for other affected branches (after the checks were implemented), search BRDB_RX_REP_EVENT_DATA for
