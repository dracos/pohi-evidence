Andy
Martin has asked me to update you this week on his behalf.

This week has been eventful. We had a meeting with the QC on Monday. Since then we
have considered carefully the recommendations which he has made, reconciled our
spreadsheet and have considered other ways in which our spreadsheet should be
amended. We have restarted the sift review process and the most recent table of statistics is
attached.

During our meeting in London with Susan, Rodric and Jarnail it was decided that the
Samra case should not at this stage be terminated.

We have also made arrangements to have preliminary discussions with a potential expert.

Kind regards

Laura
