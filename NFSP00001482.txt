detriment of Postmasters as investors in the business
Guest User, 25/04/2023 04:41 PM

GU5 There has to be a process whereby PO communicates all proposed changes with the NFSP,
allowing the NFSP to understand what is being proposed and consult with its members before the
changes are announced. PO should not impose. This should include a dispute resolution process
when both sides cannot agree.

memoire) - so not sure if this is Anoop and Ruth in this context?

Shaun Kerrison, 12/11/2024 03:21 PM

GU11 Let's agree what both PO and NFSP consider the word negotiate to mean i.e. not being dictated to,
imposed but a general consensus between both parties that what is proposed is good for PO and

Postmasters.
Reward fairly
incentivise sales

encourage correct behaviours
