Hi Lesley — as per our call, please find attached a report I did last summer for Dave Smith.

The questions and our stance remain the same, however, the solicitors acting for jfsa have now issued 3 letters before
action to POL. These are extensive requests for information eg. System change records.

Members of your team are engaged, James Davidson is aware that his team are currently involved in gathering data
and the stance on whether we have to make this kind of detailed response follows on from close work by our legal
teams. I attach the solicitors letter too and suggest you read the information they have requested (particularly page 6).
We can then discuss.

Thanks, Rod
