Attachments: OTH3525B_Event_Data.zip; OTH3537W_Event_Data.zip

All

Attached is a copy of the output events file for two ARQs.

OTH3537W contains SYSMAN2 data, but not very much as the data does not exist on the LST rig.
OTH3525B contains SYSMAN3 data.

Steve

This new functionality is under test in LST.

Have you seen the new spreadsheet that is produced ?
If so are you happy with the format ?
If not would you like to see an example ?
