As discussed, please find attached the paper on future POL options, which has been reviewed by the
BEIS governance partner and BEIS Finance. This has been raised at the UKGI board briefly, so Alex will
be aware of it. We’d like to get his view on whether this should be taken forward now, and any other
thoughts he might have.

It’s not urgent, but grateful if it could be considered in reasonably good time so that we can take it
forward, or not, as the case may be.

Kind regards
Richard
