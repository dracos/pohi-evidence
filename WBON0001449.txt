Dear Sirs

Post Office Group Litigation
Redacted Documents

We write further to your letter of 5 March 2019.

The challenges to these redactions have been raised three working days before the beginning of the
Horizon Issues Trial. With the exception of two documents, the Claimants were provided with disclosure
of these documents in either July or August 2018. The Claimants have had 6 months to raise concerns
about the redactions applied but has chosen not to do so until now. The re-review of these documents is
a time-consuming process, and has been a regrettable distraction from preparation for trial. The
documents run to c.1000 pages in total.

As per your request, Post Office's legal team and junior Counsel have reviewed the redacted documents
with which you have raised concerns. A response to each concern is set out at Schedule 1 to this letter.

For some of the documents, the redactions applied have been narrowed and replacement documents will
be provided to Elevate. Where these documents are in the trial bundle we shall arrange for replacement
documents to be uploaded.

It should be noted that where redactions have been narrowed or removed we do not believe these
documents to have any bearing on the Horizon Issues Trial since the redactions covered irrelevant
information or, at best, material of only arguable peripheral relevance. These redactions have been
removed in many instances for the sake of pragmatic co-operation and to reduce the scope of any
disputes between the parties over the redaction of documents.

Yours faithfully

Leomete Band DiciinDn,

F/1415 & POL-0220141 As explained in our letter of 3 January 2019, an incorrect redacted version
F/1416 POL-0444078 of the document was exhibited to Mr Godeseth's witness statement.

Are-review of part-privileged documents which contain the term "mediation
scheme" has been undertaken. As a result of this review, some or all of the
redactions applied to the following documents have been removed.

The first four documents are email chains which had been part redacted. It
should be noted that the redacted data within these documents had already
been disclosed to the Claimants in later versions of these email chains.
The redacted information has therefore already been disclosed to the

I Claimants in January 2018 and no prejudice has been caused.
