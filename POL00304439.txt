Please find attached an email which may be the one referred to?

I have records of a significant number of documents — notice of suspension / charge letters / note of interviews etc. and
some information about the appeal. Would you like me to send everything to you?

Kind regards

Hi Angela

I believe we may be talking about Rivenhall here. I can find no related emails between Alan & myself. I’ve been through
the former agent case file and there is no e mail in there either.

Alan will have a look at his records later today.

I have no memory of making a statement like this.

Andy, Alan,

As part of a Mediation Scheme case submission the Applicant is referring to an e-mail a copy of which I’m trying to track
down. You have been mentioned in respect of this e-mail:

meena crete with the Andy Winn/Alan Lusher email in the case of Ward which ie states that Fujitsu can remotely
change the figures in the branches without the SPMs' knowledge or authorit;

Would you please as a matter of urgency send me a copy of this e-mail, associated e-mails and any other associated
information please.

Thanks,
Angela
