PART A: RELATIONSHIP
Funding Condition

Post Office may at any time prior to the Conditionality Expiry Date deliver to Fujitsu
Services a Funding Notice.

During the Conditionality Period the provisions of Part A of Schedule A6 shall apply.

Where Post Office delivers a Funding Notice prior to the Conditionality Expiry Date, the
provisions of Part B of Schedule A6 shall apply with effect from the date of receipt by
Fujitsu Services of such Funding Notice.

Where Post Office does not deliver a Funding Notice prior to the Conditionality Expiry
Date, the provisions of Part C of Schedule A6 shall apply with effect from the
Conditionality Expiry Date.

Where Post Office notifies Fujitsu Services in writing prior to the Conditionality Expiry
Date that it will not deliver a Funding Notice, the provisions of Part C of Schedule A6
shall apply with effect from the date on which Fujitsu Services receives that notice in
writing.

Post Office shall ensure that during the Conditionality Period Fujitsu Services is
provided with confirmations by way of issue of a purchase order or a series of purchase
orders or otherwise in writing in respect of HNG-X Development to be carried out in

the provisions of Schedule D2 and to the extent such Charges fall within the estimated
aggregate HNG-X T&M Budget in respect of a particular Planning Period (as set out in

Post Office shall have the option of obtaining from Fujitsu Services all or any of the
Consumables in such quantities as may be reasonably required by Post Office by
giving Fujitsu Services not less than 30 days prior written notice thereof.

Fujitsu Services shall deliver or procure delivery of any Consumables to an authorised
representative of Post Office at times and locations to be mutually agreed between
Fujitsu Services and Post Office (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

Fujitsu Services shall maintain and make available a high level specification for each
of the Consumables. In the event that a high level specification is unavailable in
relation to a Consumable because it contains information confidential to the
manufacturer, Fujitsu Services shall maintain, and make available to Post Office, a list
of approved products, ordered by brand name where applicable.

Fujitsu Services warrants for use in Equipment installed in Branches:
14.4.1 the Consumables; and

identity, which comply with the high level specification for each Consumable
which shall be maintained by Fujitsu Services.

Notwithstanding Clauses 14.3 and 14.4, but subject to Clause 14.6, nothing shall
prevent Post Office from using any product as alternatives to the Consumables in any
part of the Infrastructure.

Where Post Office uses any such product referred to in Clause 14.5 in the
Infrastructure which either fails to comply with the high level specification or is not
contained in the list of approved products referred to in Clause 14.3:

14.6.1 Fujitsu Services will be entitled to recover from Post Office and Post Office
shall pay any and all reasonable additional costs and expenses incurred by
Fujitsu Services if and to the extent Fujitsu Services can demonstrate to Post
Office (Post Office acting reasonably) that such costs and expenses have been
incurred as a result of Post Office's use of such product; and

14.6.2 Fujitsu Services shall be relieved of any contractual remedies which Post
Office may have arising from a failure of any Equipment installed in Branches
to the extent that such failure is directly associated with Post Office’s use of
such product.

Consumables required to operate the PostShop Services in Branches do not fall within
the scope of this Clause 14 and Fujitsu Services is under no obligation to provide such
consumables.

acceptable consumable.

IPR owned by Third Parties

Post Office acknowledges and agrees that all Intellectual Property Rights in Horizon
Third Party Software and Third Party Items (excluding Intellectual Property Rights in
Third Party Items required to be assigned to Post Office pursuant to Clause 29) shall
remain vested in the relevant third party proprietor of those rights.

In consideration of the payment of the relevant Charges:

30.7.1 subject to Clauses 30.11 and 30.12, Fujitsu Services hereby grants or shall
grant, as the case may be, to Post Office a perpetual (subject to Clause 30.6.3),
royalty-free, irrevocable and non-exclusive sub-licence:

(a) to Use Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third Party Software;
and

(b) to use Third Party Items (other than HNG-X Third Party Software);

in each case where Fujitsu Services has procured the rights to grant such sub-
licences; or

30.7.2 subject to Clause 30.11, if Fujitsu Services is unable to procure the right to
grant the sub-licence referred to in Clause 30.6.1, having used all reasonable
endeavours to procure such right, Fujitsu Services shall procure that the
relevant third party grants to Post Office a royalty-free and non-exclusive
licence:

(a) to Use Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third Party Software;
and

(b) to use Third Party Items (other than HNG-X Third Party Software),

and shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that such licence is
perpetual (subject to Clause 30.6.3) and irrevocable.

30.7.3. Each of the sub-licences and/or licences granted or procured pursuant to this
Clause 30.6 in respect of Horizon Third Party Software shall terminate upon the
later of:

(a) the occurrence of Trigger Point T6 (Counter Application Rollout

30.9

30.10

(b) the date when the Horizon Third Party Software is no longer used in the
provision or receipt of the Existing Services in accordance with this
Agreement.

Each of Post Office's sub-licences and licences under Clauses 30.6.1 and 30.6.2
respectively shall be subject to any additional terms and conditions imposed by the
licensor, provided that any terms of any such sub-licence or licence shall not detract
from the rights granted to Post Office hereunder. Without prejudice to the generality of
the foregoing, Post Office accepts the licence terms relating to the Escher Upgrade
Software set out in Schedule B4.1 and that such terms satisfy the requirements of this
Clause 30.7.

Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to enable a third party engaged by
Post Office to use Horizon Third Party Software subject to and in accordance with this
Agreement on behalf of Post Office provided that such third party shall have entered
into an appropriate Agreed Form NDA.

Post Office shall be entitled to copy Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third
Party Software in order to create as many archival or back-up copies of the same as
are necessary. When copying such software, Post Office shall include the original
machine readable copyright notice, and a label affixed to the media identifying the
software and stating: "This medium contains an authorised copy of copyrighted
software which is the property of [the Third Party Software Owner]."

In respect of any Non-standard Third Party Material to be (i) included in or used as part
of the HNG-X Service Infrastructure or the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities,
or (ii) used to provide or receive the HNG-X Services over the HNG-X Service
Infrastructure, Fujitsu Services shall procure such rights for Post Office to use those
materials as are set out in Clause 48.8, such rights only to be granted in accordance
with the provisions of Clause 48.8 (in each case as if references to Fujitsu Background
IPR were to the IPR in the Non-standard Third Party Material). Without prejudice to
Post Office’s rights and remedies under this Agreement, in the event that Fujitsu
Services cannot procure such rights, it shall not procure the development or make use
of that Non-standard Third Party Material in connection with this Agreement without the
prior written consent of Post Office and shall, at Post Office's request and at no
additional charge to Post Office:

30.11.1 provide Post Office with such information as it may reasonably request in order
to understand and assess the reasons for, and the benefits of, the use of that
Non-standard Third Party Material (including, without limitation, identifying any
alternative software or materials which possess substantially equivalent
functionality, performance and interoperability to that of the Non-standard Third
Party Material and in relation to which the above rights can be obtained with
minimum additional costs or restrictions); and

30.11.2 either jointly approach the third party supplier with Post Office or provide
reasonable assistance to Post Office in its negotiations with such third party, in
each case with a view to obtaining the above rights.

shall not be obliged to fulfil its obligations pursuant to Clauses 30.6.1, 30.6.2 or 30.17
(as the case may be) in respect of an item of Horizon Third Party Software or a Third
Party Item in the event that an act or omission of Post Office gives rise to a right for the
proprietor of the relevant item of Horizon Third Party Software or Third Party Item to:

30.12.1 terminate its licence to Fujitsu Services of the relevant item of Horizon Third
Party Software or Third Party Item;

30.12.2 terminate its licence to Post Office of the relevant Horizon Third Party Software
or Third Party Item; or

30.12.3 require Fujitsu Services to terminate its sub-licence to Post Office of the
relevant Horizon Third Party Software or Third Party Item.

In the event that Post Office is in breach of a sub-licence of an item of Horizon Third
Party Software or a Third Party Item granted pursuant to Clause 30.6.1 and Fujitsu
Services reasonably believes that Post Office’s breach will result in the termination of
Fujitsu Services’ right to use such Third Party Item:

and requiring Post Office to remedy that breach within 30 days of receipt of
such notice; and

notice, Fujitsu Services may by notice in writing terminate the relevant sub-
licence.

The Party giving an indemnity under this Clause 34 (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall, at
its Own expense, conduct any litigation arising therefrom and all negotiations in
connection therewith and the Party receiving the indemnity (the “Indemnified Party”)
hereby agrees to grant to the Indemnifying Party exclusive control of any such litigation
and such negotiations in relation to the indemnified infringement or alleged
infringement. The Indemnifying Party shall consult with and pay due regard to the
interests (including, where the Post Office is the Indemnified Party, the commercial
interests of the Royal Mail Group and the public interest and where Fujitsu Services is
the Indemnified Party the commercial interests of the Fujitsu Services Group) and
views of the Indemnified Party in the conduct of any defence to any claim or demand
hereunder, and shall, where it is reasonable to do so taking into account also the
interests of the Indemnifying Party, comply with such interests and views.

The Indemnified Party shall, at the request of the Indemnifying Party, afford to the
Indemnifying Party all reasonable assistance for the purpose of contesting any claim or
demand made or action brought against the Indemnified Party to which the indemnity
may apply or any claim or demand made or action brought against the Indemnifying
Party to which the indemnity may apply. The Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for all reasonable costs and expenses (including but not limited to
legal costs and disbursements on a solicitor and client basis) incurred in so doing.

The Indemnified Party shall not make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the
defence or settlement of any claim, demand or action for infringement or alleged
infringement brought against the Indemnified Party to which the indemnity may apply or
any claim or demand made or action brought against the Indemnifying Party to which
the indemnity may apply.

If a claim or demand is made or action brought to which the indemnity may apply or in
the reasonable opinion of the Indemnifying Party is likely to be made or brought, the
Indemnifying Party may at its own expense either:

34.13.1 modify any or all of the affected documents, software, materials, items or other
things whatsoever without reducing the performance and functionality of the
same, or substitute alternative items, products or services of equivalent
performance and functionality for any or all of the documents, software,
materials, items or other things whatsoever, so as to avoid the infringement or
the alleged infringement but without disrupting the performance of the
Services, provided that the terms herein shall apply mutatis mutandis to such
modified or substituted items or services and such modified or substituted
items shall be acceptable to the Indemnified Party (whether by passing any
form of acceptance testing or otherwise), such acceptance not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall reimburse the Indemnified Party all
reasonable costs directly incurred by it; or

34.13.2 procure a licence to use the affected documents, software, materials, items or
other things whatsoever on terms which afford to the Indemnified Party no
more extensive rights than those originally applicable hereunder and which are
acceptable to the Indemnified Party and shall reimburse the Indemnified Party
all reasonable costs directly incurred by it.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Clause 34:

34.14.1 to the extent that any actual or alleged infringement, to which this Clause 34
applies, relates to the development by Fujitsu Services under this Agreement of
the HNG-X Service Infrastructure or the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities and does not result from (i) a breach by Fujitsu Services of the Clean
Room Rules or paragraph 4.2 of Annex 2 to Schedule B6.2 (ii) a failure by
Fujitsu Services to comply with Clause 15.1.5, or (iii) a breach by Fujitsu
Services of Clause 34.4; and

34.14.2 provided that the HNG-X Development Completion has not occurred at the
time of the claim, demand or action in respect of such infringement,

the costs of undertaking any modification or substitution or procuring a licence that may
be made or obtained pursuant to Clause 34.12 shall be treated as a normal cost of
development and Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services:

(a) for such modification work on a time cost basis, subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule D8; and

(b) in respect of any such substitution or licence, an amount equivalent to
Fujitsu Services' cost of the product used as a substitute and/or of the
necessary licence, multiplied by 95 and divided by 100.

The indemnities set out in this Clause 34 (other than where Clause 34.3.1(b) applies)
shall not apply insofar as any such claim or demand or action is in respect of:

34.15.1 any use by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party of the affected documents,
software, materials, items or other things whatsoever in combination with any
item not supplied or approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) by the Indemnifying Party where such combined use directly gives
tise to the claim, demand or action; or

34.15.2 any modification carried out by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to any
item supplied by the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement if such
modification is not authorised by the Indemnifying Party in writing; or

34.15.3any use by the Indemnified Party of the affected documents, software,
materials, items or other things whatsoever in a manner not reasonably to be
inferred from their specification (if any) or the requirements of the Indemnified
Party (including, without limitation, where Post Office is the Indemnified Party,

If the Indemnifying Party has availed itself of its rights to modify the affected
documents, software, materials, items or other things whatsoever or to supply
substitute products or services pursuant to Clause 34.12.1 or to procure a licence under
Clause 34.12.2 and such exercise of the said rights has avoided any claim, demand or
action for infringement or alleged infringement, or if the Indemnified Party has
unreasonably withheld its acceptance of any items modified or substituted by the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with Clause 34.12, then the Indemnifying Party shall

case may be) shall apply.

Schedule B4.4, Schedule C1 and/or the provisions of the Service Descriptions, all
claims to be indemnified pursuant to Clauses 34, 42 or 43 and all other claims or costs

Fujitsu Services.

The Parties expressly agree that should any limitation or provision contained in this
Clause be held to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law it shall to that
extent be deemed omitted but if any Party thereby becomes liable for loss or damage
which would otherwise have been excluded such liability shall be subject to the other
limitations and provisions set out herein.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed to relieve either Party of its common law duty to the other Party
against which a claim may be made to mitigate any loss which is the subject of such
claim.

Subject to Clause 44.1, the aggregate liability of Fujitsu Services under the SAP RTU
(including, without limitation, under any indemnity therein) arising in any Financial Year

Clause 44.10 and paragraph 22 of the SAP RTU. In the event and only to the extent of
any conflict between: (i) Clauses 44.10 and paragraph 22 of the SAP RTU; and (ii) any

increased at the end of the Financial Year ending on or around 31 March, 2007 and at
the end of each subsequent Financial Year by an amount equal to the difference

published in respect of December of the Financial Year in question and the level of the
Retail Price Index in December of the preceding Financial Year.

Insurance

Fujitsu Services shall to the extent reasonably possible insure or make provision for
self-insurance against all losses and damages which are the result of its fault or
negligence in performing the Services, including workman's compensation, public

Notwithstanding the generality of Clause 48.1 Post Office agrees:

48.3.1 only to exercise its rights under such Clause to the extent that the relevant
Project Assets apply to, and are required for the provision or receipt of the
Services or Terminable Services that are the subject of the termination or are
otherwise to be provided pursuant to Schedule E (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Exit Plan);

48.3.2 the rights provided for in Clauses 48.1 shall not apply to the PostShop Solution;
and

48.3.3 in the case of Partial Termination of the Engineering Service, that it shall

48.2.3 applies, Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services on completion of such option
or, in the case of Clause 48.2.3, such acquisition, a sum equal to the Transfer

Project Assets acquired by it shall cease to form part of the Infrastructure and this
Agreement shall be amended accordingly as provided in Schedule E.

In the event that this Agreement or a Terminable Service is terminated as provided for
herein:

48.5.1 Fujitsu Services shall return to Post Office all Property of the Royal Mail Group
in the possession of Fujitsu Services that is not required for the provision of

agreement for services with Post Office) to any employee or sub-contractor
(being an individual) (“Worker”) of Fujitsu Services who has during the six
months prior to such offer been involved for at least 75 percent. of his
contracted working time in performing Fujitsu Services’ obligations under this
Agreement which are the subject of the termination. Fujitsu Services agrees
that if that Worker accepts such offer Fujitsu Services shall release that Worker
from any breach of contract with it (other than in relation to such person's

As soon as possible following any notice of termination being given (in the case
of an early termination of this Agreement or Partial Termination) and no later
than three months prior to the expiry of this Agreement at the end of the term
set out in Clause 46.1, Fujitsu Services shall at the request of Post Office
provide to Post Office (or to the Next Supplier nominated by Post Office) a list

Terminable Service or Services (as the case may be) as reasonably required
by Post Office in order to permit compliance with the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 by Post Office or Next Supplier,

Services to produce information in breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 or in
breach of any express duty of confidentiality which Fujitsu Services may owe to
the Fujitsu Services personnel. In such circumstances, Fujitsu Services shall
use its reasonable endeavours to obtain appropriate consent for the release of
such information.

Without prejudice to Fujitsu Services’ rights and remedies under Clause 48.4.7,
Fujitsu Services shall fully indemnify Post Office from and against any and all
liabilities which Post Office may incur in connection with or as a result of any
claim or demand whatsoever by any employee or former employee of Fujitsu
Services or of any of Fujitsu Services' sub-contractors or agents in respect of
his employment with Fujitsu Services or such sub-contractor or agent (or,
pursuant to the application of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations 2006, with Post Office or the Next Supplier) and/or
its termination save to the extent such claim or demand both (i) is made by an
employee identified within the relevant employment details referred to in
Clause 48.4.4 as transferring pursuant to the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 and (ii) relates to employer's
obligations accruing after the said transfer of employment which are clearly
identified within the relevant employment details.

obligations under Regulation 13 of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations 2006 save to the extent such failure is attributable to
the failure of Post Office or a Next Supplier to comply with its obligations under
the same Regulation.

In the event of any claim or demand being made or action brought to which
Clause 48.4.5 or 48.4.6 applies, Post Office shall promptly notify Fujitsu

(Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 save to the extent such
failure is attributable to the failure of Fujitsu Services, any of its sub-
contractors or agents to comply with its or their obligations under the
same Regulation; and

(b) any change in the terms and conditions of employment of the employees
identified within the relevant employment details referred to in Clause
48.4.4 made by Post Office or a Next Supplier on or after the transfer
date or any change in the terms and conditions of the employment of the

in Clause 48.4.4 proposed by the Post Office or a Next Supplier and
whether before, on or after the transfer date but only to the extent in
each case such change or proposed change in the terms and conditions
of employment constitutes a repudiatory breach of the relevant
employee's contract of employment or involves a substantial change in
his working conditions to his material detriment.

48.5.9 Without prejudice to Post Office's rights and remedies under Clauses 48.4.4
and 48.4.10, in the event of Partial Termination for convenience pursuant to

58.2 This Agreement is personal to Fujitsu Services. Fujitsu Services shall not assign,
novate, sub-contract or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or any part thereof without
the previous written consent of Post Office.

58.3 Subject to Clause 58.5 Post Office hereby consents to Fujitsu Services having
subcontracted its obligations specified in Schedule C2 to the respective sub-contractors
specified therein. Additional or substitute sub-contractors may be approved from time
to time in accordance with Clause 58.1 after the date hereof, in which case Schedule

this Agreement, Fujitsu Services shall remain primarily responsible for the acts and
omissions of its sub-contractors committed by them in the course of performing or
purporting to perform any of Fujitsu Services' obligations on Fujitsu Services' behalf as
though such acts or omissions were its own.

58.4 Post Office shall be entitled to assign, novate or otherwise dispose of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement or any part thereof (including, where appropriate,
requiring the grant by Fujitsu Services or its licensors of a direct licence of any
Software other than Third Party Software, and requiring Fujitsu Services to use all
reasonable endeavours to procure the grant of a direct licence or obtain consent to the
transfer of the sub-licence of any Third Party Software) to any other body which

provided that any such assignment, novation or other disposal shall not increase the
burden of Fujitsu Services' obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

58.5 Post Office shall be entitled to disclose, to the extent necessary for the purposes of this
Agreement, to any transferee any Confidential Information of Fujitsu Services which
relates to the performance of the Services by Fujitsu Services. In such circumstances
Post Office shall authorise the transferee to use such Confidential Information only for
purposes relating to the performance of the Services and for no other purposes and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the transferee shall be bound by the confidentiality undertaking
contained herein in relation to such Confidential Information.

58.6 The consent referred to in Clause 58.2 and any approval which may be granted in
respect of additional or substitute sub-contractors pursuant to Clause 58.2 is provided,
and shall be granted (as the case may be), on the understanding that Fujitsu Services
shall keep Post Office informed of the general nature and scope of the work to be sub-
contracted and the duration of the relevant sub-contracts (such information to be
recorded in Schedule C2) and shall consult with Post Office prior to amending or
supplementing such arrangements or commitments and shall take account of all
reasonable requests and comments that Post Office shall make in connection
therewith.

Non-Solicitation

Subject to Clause 48.4.3, neither Party shall during the currency of the Agreement or
for a period of six months thereafter without the written permission of the other (not to
be unreasonably withheld) either on its own account or for any other person, firm or
undertaking either directly or indirectly knowingly solicit or entice away from the other
(the "Previous Employer") any Key Individual who is then or shall have been in the
previous three months either:

59.2.1 an employee of the Previous Employer; or

59.2.2 engaged by the Previous Employer as a contractor performing the services of
such an employee.

In the event that such Key Individual is employed or engaged by the other Party with
the agreement of the other Party (such agreement to include without limitation agreed
transfer of work and associated staff between the Parties during the term of the
Agreement) or after redundancy from the Previous Employer, the Previous Employer
shall not (unless agreed otherwise) be paid any sum by the other Party by way of
compensation.

If either Party is in breach of this condition that Party will pay to the other Party by way
of liquidated damages and not by way of penalty the Solicitation Fee.

Nothing in this Clause 59 is intended to prevent or frustrate the right of any individual to
seek employment as he thinks fit.

Force Majeure

For the purposes of this Agreement the expression "Force Majeure" shall mean any
cause affecting the performance by a Party hereto of its obligations arising from acts,
events, omissions, happenings or non-happenings beyond its reasonable control
including (but without limiting the generality thereof) (i) Governmental Regulations
(subject to Clause 60.7), (ii) fire, (iii) flood, or (iv) any disaster or an industrial dispute
affecting a third party. Any act, event, omission, happening or non-happening will only
be considered Force Majeure if it is not attributable to the wilful act, neglect or failure to
take reasonable precautions of the affected Party, its agents or employees, and only if
a substitute third party is not reasonably available (having regard, without limitation, to
the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation. In no event
shall any fraudulent act or omission by any third party or Party in relation to the
Services for which Fujitsu Services is liable under Clause 43.1 constitute a Force
Majeure event.

Neither Party hereto shall in any circumstances be liable to the other Party hereto for
any loss of any kind whatsoever including but not limited to any damages or abatement
of Charges whether directly or indirectly caused to or incurred by the other Party by
reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement which is due to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party
shall use all reasonable endeavours to continue to perform, or resume performance of,
such obligations under this Agreement for the duration of such Force Majeure event. In

the case of any such failure or delay on the part of Fujitsu Services, the Parties shall
agree an orderly process for such continuation or resumption of performance (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and Fujitsu Services shall comply
with such process. Fujitsu Services shall remain liable to perform the Business
Continuity Services, save where such Business Continuity Services are themselves
also affected by Force Majeure, in which case Fujitsu Services shall be required to use
all reasonable endeavours to perform such Business Continuity Services.

If Fujitsu Services shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give
rise to or which are likely to give rise to any such failure or delay on its part it shall
forthwith notify Post Office within one Working Day and shall inform Post Office of the
period which it is estimated that such failure or delay shall continue. If Post Office shall
become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give rise to any such failure or
delay on its part, it shall forthwith notify Fujitsu Services within one Working Day and
shall inform Fujitsu Services of the period which it is estimated that such failure or
delay shall continue.

It is expressly agreed that any failure by Fujitsu Services to perform, or any delay by
Fujitsu Services in performing, its obligations under this Agreement which results from
any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations by any person, firm or
company with which Fujitsu Services shall have entered into any contract, supply
arrangement or sub-contract or otherwise shall be regarded as a failure or delay due to
Force Majeure only in the event that such person firm or company shall itself be
prevented from or delayed in complying with its obligations under such contract, supply
arrangement or sub-contract or otherwise as a result of circumstances of Force
Majeure and there is no substitute person, firm or company reasonably available
(having regard, without limitation, to the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform
the affected obligation.

lf any Force Majeure event prevents any Party from performing its obligations
hereunder for a period in excess of 90 consecutive days, Post Office may after
consulting with Fujitsu Services and taking into account Fujitsu Services’ views,
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Clause 47.1.5.

Extension of Time

If the performance of this Agreement by either Party is delayed by reason of any Force
Majeure event (as defined in Clause 60.1), both Parties shall be entitled to a
reasonable extension of time subject to there being no entitlement to any additional
costs or expenses incurred as a result of the delay. The Party so delayed shall notify
the other Party in writing within one Working Day of becoming aware of the Force
Majeure event.

Political Risk

reduced or modified obligations resulting in increased cost to Fujitsu Services,
without its agreement in accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

Fujitsu Services of its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of
Clause 47.1, Clause 47.2, Clause 47.3 or Clause 47.7, Post Office shall be entitled to
disclose Confidential Information to bona fide potential Next Suppliers of the Services
(or Terminable Service(s), as the case may be) to the extent that such disclosure is
reasonably required to enable any potential Next Supplier to prepare a reasonably
detailed tender proposal to Post Office in relation to the provision of Replacement
Services. Post Office shall ensure that prior to any Confidential Information being
disclosed to any such potential Next Supplier, such potential Next Supplier shall enter
into an Agreed Form NDA and shall immediately inform Fujitsu Services if it has
reason to believe that the potential Next Supplier is in breach of the undertakings
contained in that confidentiality agreement.

The Parties hereby agree that (other than as required by law):

61.5.1 each Party (and any person employed or engaged by it in connection with this
Agreement in the course of such employment or engagement) shall only use
Confidential Information of the other Party for the purposes of this Agreement;

61.5.2 each Party receiving Confidential Information from the other Party shall take all
necessary precautions to ensure that no Confidential Information of the other
Party is used other than for the purposes of this Agreement by the receiving
Party's employees, servants, agents or sub-contractors including, without
limitation, obtaining from any such agent or sub-contractor a signed
confidentiality undertaking on substantially the same terms as are contained in
this Clause; and

61.5.3 without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing:

(a) neither Fujitsu Services nor any person engaged by Fujitsu Services
(whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise) shall use the
Confidential Information of Post Office for the solicitation of business
from any third party or away from Post Office; and

Information held by each Contractor in tangible form to be
returned to the Post Office, and all such information held in

In the event that Confidential Information is disclosed by any Party to its professional
advisers, that Party shall procure that its professional advisers comply with the
restrictions contained in this Clause, mutatis mutandis.

Nothing in this Clause 61 shall restrict the Post Office from using, or disclosing to a
third party for use on its behalf, documents or materials (including, without limitation,
