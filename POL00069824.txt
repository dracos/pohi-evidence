Name: Stephen Dilley Location: N/A Date: 7 November 2006

Start time: Units:

I had a telephone conversation with Greg Booth to go over his amended Statement. Telling
him that I had spoken to Fujitsu this morning and they had told me that the following was
the order of the transaction. Then reading to him paragraph 5 a, b, c and d from the
amended Statement. Greg agreed that that was an accurate record. I also told Greg that
we were having a general sweep-up and that if there was anything that had occurred to him,
even if it could help Mr Castleton, or could help the Post Office, that he had not previously
thought of, then he should feel free to tell me because I could put it in to the Statement. He
has said that he had thought quite a lot about this, both at the time and on making his
Statement, and there was nothing else that he could think of.

Time Engaged: 12 Minutes
