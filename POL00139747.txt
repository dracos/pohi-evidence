Dear All

l attach a note which I believe captures all we talked about this morning. Please check. You
chaps are closer to this than RH and I and if there is anything I have not grasped or
covered you must let me know. Equally if here is anything that is plain wrong you must let
me know.

I have seen SC's note. The comment I have is how are we going to impart the advice to the
PO that if there are factions within it who are running around trying to lay off blame for
their own shortcomings by lying about the advice they have received then they lose
privilege. I thought SC's advice would cover this. On reflection it may be something for
Andy to raise with Hugh and to note or to confirm ina letter to him.

Andy - what is Hugh's surname?
