Thanks for this it doesn’t feel as if there is anything further for me to follow up, maybe a briefing before Panorama.
As always let me know if there is anything I can help with.

When we have a SID specification I will share it with you

Thanks

Hi Alwen
I’ve just come off the call between the Minister and Tim Parker, Nothing significant to report.

On Sparrow, the Minister informed Tim that she would like him to look at things with fresh eyes when he arrived,
which he was happy with. Tim confirmed he would be happy to meet MPs etc. on the matter but once he was up to
speed. The Minister mentioned that Panorama was happening but it wasn’t discussed.

To be aware, Tim and the Minister discussed the ARC Chair shortlist briefly. Tim explained he was keen to find the
right candidate, that the shortlist from RRA looked reasonable on paper but he wanted to judge when he met them in
September. The Minister told Tim that she would be keen for at least one of the vacancies (SID/NED) to be filled by a
female candidate given the importance of diversity, which Tim noted.

Do get in touch if any questions at all

Hi Alwen

BNR is speaking to him today at 1445. I spoke to him yesterday. He is pretty robust on Sparrow (i.e. if we have done
nothing wrong then we stick to our guns), but is happy to agree for BNR to say to Bridgen and Co that the new chair
will of course take a critical and independent look at the issue. He did also offer to sit in with her in her meeting with
Arbuthnot, which was arranged late yesterday for the 17" Sept — we should all mull that one.

She is aware that Panorama is coming on the 17" Aug and so there is a chance she might mention it, but she is more
concerned at the moment about ensuring POL has done the right thing to date, and is seen to have done the right

thing, which is what today’s meeting is about.

Paula and I are considered how and when it is best to brief Tim on Panorama.
Would you let me know when Baroness Neville-Rolfe is planning to speak to him, as she was going to

mention Sparrow. Notification re Panorama would come better after that, as we could refer to her
conversation and offer a more immediate brief if he would like one.

Dear All
Please see below a note from Mark about the Panorama programme on Sparrow

Thanks
Alwen

Alwen Lyons
Company Secretary

Dear All

As you know we have been engaging with the BBC Panorama programme in recent
months in relation to Sparrow. Despite the programme having been postponed twice,
it is now due to air on August 17 (and has been included in BBC schedules). We
continue to push back very hard with the programme and are exploring every
possible avenue to challenge their unsubstantiated allegations.

As with the previous planned programmes, we will be implementing a full
communications plan with a particular focus on assuring colleagues across the
network. I will update you further as this develops but you can be assured we will be
providing colleagues (and particularly those in customer/postmaster facing roles)
with clear rebuttal and contact points.

With the documentary aired last night, I do not plan any communications on
Panorama until later in the week, followed by concerted communications after the
final documentary is aired next week.

Best wishes,
UKG1I00005361
