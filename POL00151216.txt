Belinda

This is probably not quite what you want and probably much more than you need but take a look and if there are any
other specifics you need me to dig into then please shout.

For me there are two main points regarding the emails request;

1) Although the attached provides an overview of Spot Review 5 I believe this is an important context to be
demonstrated here between the perceived importance of the emails request and the primary challenge that live
data could be accessed by the testing team at Bracknell in 2008.

2) What data was actually on the disk? Although I ensured the request was managed accordingly I did not
physically see what was on the disk ahead of it going over to SS. I assume the knowledgeable person in this
instance is Dave King.
