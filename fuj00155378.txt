rejected by the board.

'We need to consider what we do with regards to witness statements already provided,

 The identification of (1) may well result in questions seeking the viability of (2).

Howard
Some brief words, the problem first raised in SI has been fully investigated by S.I.,
Audit and SSC.
The real problems I can see is the overhead in the event checking and Penny's
statement which contractually is now incorrect.

Regards Pete
