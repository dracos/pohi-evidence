Pete,

At the ISMR, the CP was discussed and it was agreed that the content will need to be
re-written as there are possible .conflict...i.e. Potential........ , This will be
rejected by the board.

Please re-write the CP and if required speak to Hilary to get further wording so that
it can be accepted as soon.

Kind Regards
Howard

Hi Pete
Is the CP now in the system?

It must be stressed that the current process for évent checking is not an acceptable
procedure.

We need to consider what we do with regards to'witness statements already provided,
(1) where “the case has not yet gone to court and (2) where the case has gone to court.
The identification of (1) may well result in questions seeking the viability of (2).

Regards
Penny

Howard

Some brief words, the problem first raised in SI has been fully investigated by SI,
Audit and SSC.

The real problems I can see is the overhead in the event checking and Penny's
statement which contractually is now incorrect.
