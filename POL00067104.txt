Debbie,

It was nice to eventually meet you on Friday. I am currently working on the
various court orders and hope to have a response to you within the requisite
time. In the meantime is it possible for us to have electronic copies of the
interviews plus copies of the working tapes in relation to Carl Page? Also,
can you confirm that the transcripts of the interviews provided by the
prosecution are complete or verbatim records rather than summaries?

Finally, can you provide me with a business address for Steven William
Cottier, Case Officer HM Custom and Excise or an address of the person we
would write to regarding Custom and Excise disclosure in this case?

Thank you in anticipation

Kind regards

Tom Cleary
