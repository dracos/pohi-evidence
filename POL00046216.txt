Martin

At the request of the Working Group we have been re-drafting some of the exec summaries on the POL investigation
reports. Our changes are stylistic rather than substantive but whilst doing this, I've been keeping an eye out for any
report that includes an Officer's Report as Harry kindly flagged that we should be avoiding disclosure of this type of
document (and I think you may have discussed this previously with Rodric?).

M029 (Thomas) is one of the cases where we have re-drafted the exec summary of the report however it refers to an
officer's report and also a related investigation document — all attached.

This appears to be a case where both prosecution documents are important to prove the conclusions reached in the
POL report as there are no alternative documents on which to rely (eg. POL have confirmed that the transcripts of the
interviews with Thomas are not on the prosecution file). Having reviewed both prosecution documents I cannot see
any material that appears controversial however Rodric and I would be grateful for your thoughts on whether
disclosing the two prosecution docs would create specific difficulties in this case.

Kind regards
Andy
