Thx Victoria.

Juts to confirm that my lave is 21** July to 3" August — so definitely need to bear this in mind.

Angela - I think it would be good to add Chris Howard to the list also ~ whilst this is more about
contracts than remuneration, he does have a great working knowledge of this stuff too.

Andy ~ can you confirm I can share the Paul Inwood witness attachment with him.

tam about to send over Stewart’s review of Paul’s statement — straight to you Victoria marked legally

Dear Angela, Nick and Mark

Thanks for your time on the call earlier.

I've prepared an indication of the timings for the phases of witness statements below. This isn’t intended
to be set in stone since we will need to fit around witness availability if they are doing something they

cannot change. However, your help (in particular I was thinking Mark and Rodric) in clearing their desks
and getting us priority access to them would be much appreciated.

I will also work into the below some time to deal with witness evidence on specific issues raised in relation
to specific Lead Claimants, but have focused on the evidence on generic issues for now.

For your information, I will be assisted with the preparation of the statements by a team consisting of

complexity of the evidence allocated to each team member, they may be able to work more quickly than
the above for certain of the witnesses.

Please let me know if you have any comments or queries on the above.

Kind regards

Victoria
