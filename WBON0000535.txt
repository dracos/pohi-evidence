I did an analysis of the longer list putting names to the subjects. I'll forward this and that to Mandy and ask
her to compare and add names to this.

From an initial review I'd say it looks like AVDB, Sarah Rimmer, John Breeden/Helen Dickinson, Stewart
Barclay / Nick Beal, Kendra Dickinson

The ones I’m least certain of are training, and the accounts one, and some of the 6 May need to be split into
more than one witness.
