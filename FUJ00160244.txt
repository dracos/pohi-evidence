Andy,

Have just heard back from the Account team re John Simpkins. Unfortunately he does not wish to become a Witness
either.Suggest we re-think.

Dave Ibbett who is holding the fort in Pete Newsome’s absence this week, proposes that we await Pete’s return on
Monday and discuss alternative options then.

Makes sense to me.

There isn't an alternative to witness evidence. We could look at summonsing Steve but that would be far from ideal

We need to urgently (today?) work out whether there is an alternative to Steve. If that hits a dead-end then we will
need to re-group and think again.

Kind regards

Jonny/All,

Will look into John and possibly anybody else with the team.

A couple of questions:-

So from this I assume that POL are not looking to sub-poena Steve?

Are there any other court processes/ways that we can present Steve’s feedback in Court?

Thanks
Chris

Chris,

John Simpkins has provided a lot of comments on Mr Roll's statement. I don't know his background save that he is a
member of Steve's team, but he could be a potential candidate.

Kind regards

Dear All,
PSB the outcome of the conversation between Steve and Graham Allen (his line manager).
Looks like we need a further conversation as to next steps?

8 AM

Jay, Christopher q

Chris,
Steve and I are both early starters so I have had a long conversation with Steve this morning.

1am afraid he is adamant that he does not want to voluntarily put himself through the stress he feels this will
generate despite wanting to defend the team from that time. He was expecting someone to come back to him and
had already given it a great deal of thought. He is aware that he may get subpoenaed and would deal with that if it
happened. He didn’t think sharing the load with another team member would help.

I tried to persuade but did not want to push too hard; not sure what else we can try. Steve is not the sort of person to
take decisions lightly or be easily swayed from his chosen direction.
