Thanks Andy ~ I think we need an agenda —even if we don’t stick to it as Tom and Jane will expect something prior to the
meeting

Sorry

Jane, Rodric

We've spoken further with Deloitte. Although Deloitte are being cooperative, their risk management processes mean
that answers are being vetted and this is taking us time to get forward progress. They have been able to clarify some
further issues but the main point is that to get a clear picture they will need to undertake some more testing - see
below.

Current position. The overall current position has not changed ~ there is a still a risk that super-users could change
transaction data without leaving a footprint. However, the circumstances in which this could happen appear to be
narrowing (because certain types of changes will be logged and those logs cannot be edited). The risk area appears
to be around (i) spoofing digital seais and (ii) data in transit (ie. when it is travelling between servers).

Forward plan. Deloitte need to review the actual audit logs from Horizon. We originally put this work out of scope
because it was not thought to be necessary given that we were not aware of the “segregation of duties" problem until
the last minute. Reviewing the actual audit logs allows to points to be investigated:

1. Deloitte can look at what types of super-user activity are being logged and in what level of detail. This will
hopefully allow them to answer the theoretical question about what types of super-user activity would not
leave a footprint.

2. We can see whether any logged super-user activity has affected any claimant branches.

Next step. I'm asking Deloitte to cost up this option and I will then come back to you for approval.

Kind regards
Andy

Quick update.

We've put further questions to Deloitte but not yet had a full response. We are hoping to have the summary of the
Deloitte report ready by tomorrow. It's currently with Deloitte for comments.

I'll let you know as soon as I know more.

Kind regards

Rodric, Jane
As discussed yesterday, please find below the relevant extracts from the Deloitte report.

I've put the additional questions to Deloitte and will let you know as soon as I have answers.

Kind regards

Appendix 7:
Key questions

a) Whether Fujitsu can edit or delete transactions recorded by branches in a way that could impact on the branch's overall
accounting position?

Yes - Transactions can be deleted at database layer (BRDB) by DBA’s.

Before audit store access locked down, transactions could be deleted at audit store level (and still can be once a
transaction has been in the audit store for 7 years), but this would not affect a branches overall accounting
position uniess there was a query that resulted in the extraction of data. If data was extracted from the audit store
and records had been tampered with or removed, this would be flagged upon extraction by the process to report
on data integrity, so it would be transparent that the data has been edited. It should be noted the warning that the
data integrity check failed can be ignored by the operator.

b) How difficult it would be to do (a)?

Access to do (a) is restricted to appropriate personne! by Fujitsu. For users who have DBA access on the BRDB,
this could be done.

However if the edit/defete of the transaction was not done before the data had been ‘collected’ by the Audit Server
(typically every 15 minutes), then this would not affect the record of data in the Audit Store. The audit store is the
focation where data is retrieved from in the event of a dispute.

Further if the edit/delete of the transaction was performed prior to the data being ‘collected’ by the Audit Server,
whilst it would be reflected in the audit store data, upon retrieval of branch data from the audit store, if a
transaction had been removed, the ‘data density’ check would highlight a missing transaction. If upon retrieval of
branch data from the audit store a transaction had been amended, the digital signature check would highlight an
issue with the integrity of the data.

c) Whether (a) is possible without leaving a “footprint” that is visible to either (i) postmaster or (ii) Post Office / Fu.

i) Amendment / deletion of transactions would not be overtly notified to the Postmaster, however if the
amendment / deletion happened at the BRDB, this would affect the declarations made by Postmasters
(encouraged to do so on a daily basis) and also declarations are required to be done in order fo rollover into the
next accounting period (typically 4-5 weeks}. The monthly Branch Trading Statement which a Postmaster must
Sign off on in order to roll into the next accounting period would also be impacted by a change of this nature which
would capture summarised totals of transactional data, which could be reconciled by branch back to the granular
transaction log reports. Ail of the mentioned reports are mechanisms by which the Postmaster would be made
aware of any such changes.

Amendment / deletion of data in the audit store has no effect on branch accounting and would only impact a
branch (Postmaster be made aware) if data was retrieved from the audit store. Further if upon retrieval of branch

POL00029103
POL00029103

data from the audit store a transaction had been removed, the ‘data density’ check would highlight a missing
transaction. If upon retrieval of branch data from the audit store a transaction had been amended, the digital
signature check would highlight an issue with the integrity of the data.

i) Branch Database privileged Oracle user operations are audited by Oracle to the SYS.AUD$ table. This table is
extracted into audit files every night by a batch job into a directory from which the audit archiving system extracts
the data. The audit data is currently stored for 10 years. This table can be extracted from the Audit Store by
Fujitsu.

Any amendment / deletion of data in the audit store would be visible to Fujitsu only when data is retrieved. Upon
retrieval of branch data from the audit store a transaction had been removed, the ‘data density’ check would
highlight a missing transaction. If upon retrieval of branch data from the audit store a transaction had been
amended, the digital signature check would highlight an issue with the integrity of the data.

As per the exception noted on page 3, there is a smalj theoretical risk of a user ‘spoofing’ the digital signature,
arising from a failure in SOD controls relating to the digital signature.

d) Whether (a) has ever actuaily happened?

Audit logs of super-user access in the BRDB exist. Fujitsu have confirmed where amendment / deletion of live
database tables would be identifiable from this log.

Our work has not included obtaining logs for the relevant time period and performing analytics over them to
identify any instances where this has happened, and investigate if so. Such procedures should be theoretically
possible however.

Page 3:

Access to mechanisms for managing the digital signatures are segregated from database administration responsibilities
(via system access rights restrictions), meaning that even if such access rights be abused the digital signature that is
included with every Counter and Kiosk transaction could not be spoofed. ~ Relevant Exceptions Noted.

The exception noted was

- ‘A number of users have access fo mechanisms for managing the digital signatures and have database administration
responsibilities and access. This raises the theoretical risk of a user ‘spoofing’ the digital signature. It is understood that
for this risk to be realised, due to time limitations and volume of work required in order to successfully ‘spoof’ the
signature, a program would have to be written.’
