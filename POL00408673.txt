Thank you (and for your other comments on the LOR). Very helpful.

I'm not particularly worried about releasing the investigation guidelines - their content is pretty benign. I just wanted to
make sure that we were not waiving some form of privilege. In this regard, your advice is just what was needed.

Kind regards

I have realised you didn't call me about this yesterday. I am available for a chat today if you wish. It may

help however if I set out some thoughts here for you:
1. I do not think that investigation guidelines can attract privilege (advice or litigation) for the simple
reason that these are not communications between a client and his lawyer made under conditions of
confidentiality for the purposes of enabling the client to seek, or the lawyer to give, legal advice or
assistance in a relevant legal context, or advice or assistance given in the context of litigation.
2. If CK gave advice about "privilege" attaching to "investigative techniques" then I suspect they may
have been speaking about public interest immunity (PII). It was for this reason I asked for the source of
the advice.
3. In the criminal environment, disclosure is subject to the single test in s.3 of the CPIA which I set out
for you in my email this morning on the topic of the LOR. If the material doesn't pass the test then it is
not disclosable (subject to application being made by the defence and the judge ruling upon it).
4. If in civil litigation the test for disclosure is also, in effect, relevance/materiality to the issues in the
case, then challenging the relevance/materiality of such guidelines may, I suppose, be one way, pro
tem, of withholding disclosure of them.
5. 1am unsure if I have read the investigation guidelines you are referring to; it is possible I read them
a long time ago when advising about such guidelines in one of my 2013 review documents. Either
way I'd be surprised if in the criminal arena, if relevant and prima facie disclosable, they would be
regarded as so sensitive as to indicate that could be withheld from disclosure on grounds they
reveal matters relating to an important public interest, namely, POL's security team's investigative
techniques.
6. At all events, I seriously doubt that POL could make a Pll application in such circumstances as the
first question that arises is whether a private prosecutor can invoke public interest immunity. I'd be
interested to know if POL has ever made a PII application in any case. Be that as it may, the issue is
really whether the material is so sensitive that disclosure would damage a public interest.

1am sorry that this will not assist you in holding off a disclosure request for now by claiming privilege. But I
hope that my other thoughts about it may do so, such as asserting (if it is correct to do so in the civil arena)
POL00408673

that the guidelines are not material to any known or anticipated issue in the case.

Apologies — forgot one point.

We've been asked to disclose "Post Office's investigation guidelines" which we presume to be a reference to any
investigation guidelines followed by the Security Team when looking into suspected criminal activity. I recall someone
(probably CK) saying that information about investigative techniques are generally privileged.

We are not obliged to give disclosure of documents at this stage. If the above understanding is broadly applicable, my
preferred approach would be to say that documents of this type might be be privileged and therefore we are not
disclosing them.

If you have 5 minutes at some point this week, please could we discuss whether such documents might be covered by
privilege?

Kind regards
Andy

As mentioned previously, would you mind reviewing our draft Letter of Response (LOR) that we have
prepared for the Group Litigation with the postmasters?

The LOR is long, so please do not review the whole thing. We have highlighted below all the references
to prosecutions or criminal law matters — please could you review these sections?

5(F): Factual Allegations: criminal investigations and prosecutions (paragraphs 5.48 to 5.79)
6(D): Misfeasance in public office (paragraphs 6.30 to 6.32)

6(E): Malicious Prosecution (paragraphs 6.33 to 6.42)

8(B): Barred claims: criminal cases (paragraphs 8.8 to 8.12)

Schedule 4: Section 8: False accounting (8.1 — 8.6)

Some of these sections mention factual matters that are not within your knowledge so we're not asking
for your sign off of these sections. I should however be grateful if you could flag whether we've
misstated any of the criminal law concepts. All other comments of course welcomed.

Just in case you need it, I've attached the Letter of Claim to which our letter responds. No need to
review the LOC but you've got it just in case.

If possible, comments / amendments by the end of this week would be appreciated.

Kind regards
Andy
