Came up to see you — we need some help plse:

Our criminal lawyers have advised us that there ought to now be at least one degree of separation between any
expert witness called in support of a POL prosecution and the Second Sight process.

Up until now FJ have fielded Gareth Jenkins as their expert witness on Horizon. We now need someone else.
This someone else should ideally be independent of FJ but we have a timing issue: the problem is we will need
someone in the short term for criminal cases going through the pipeline at the moment (the next one is due next

week!)

The person has to have the appropriate knowledge of Horizon and will have to deal with both new cases and ones
currently underway (where up until now GJ has been the expert witness).

So for the short term we need another FJ expert.

Are you able to get this arranged with FJ plse asap? We would want to see candidate details and our criminal
lawyer would like to meet them face to face this week.

Plse call if you want to discuss.
