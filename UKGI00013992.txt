Thank you for your letter of 16 January 2001 to Stephen Byers enclosing
correspondence from your constituents, Geoffrey and Jean Newton of The

Village Store and Post Office, I eee BRO needy CONCEMNING

the future of their post office and computerisation of the rural post office

network. I am replying as the Minister responsible for Post Office matters.

With regard to computerisation, the Post Office is equipping the entire
counters’ network with the fully automated Horizon system to replace the
current out-dated and expensive manual systems. A key element of the Post
Office’s strategy to secure a long term viable future for the post office network
as a whole is to use the Horizon system to attract new business, such as
universal banking services and Government General Practitioner facilities,
which will only be able to be operated on the computerised system. In
addition, the new system provides a central, electronic accounting and
management information system to deliver the traditional services offered by
the post office network more efficiently, accurately and securely. It is
essential therefore that all outlets, without exception, are connected to the
central system.

To date, over 16,000 post offices have been successfully automated, with the
vast majority of subpostmasters being extremely positive about the system
and quickly seeing real benefits in operating the system. I understand that
there have been no major breakdowns of the Horizon system and that
comprehensive training and helpline facilities are provided. The technical
helpline has 200 staff handling calls (currently running at 70,000 a month)
with 96% of calls answered within one minute. The Post Office run the
National Business Support Centre which handles calls relating to post office
operational issues and last month the Centre answered 84% of all calls within

15 seconds.

Whilst I do fully recognise that many subpostmasters, like the Newtons, view
the prospect of computerisation with considerable unease and trepidation, the
Post Office’s experience, with almost 90% of the network now automated, is
that, whatever the age of the subpostmaster, the change proves to be much
easier than anticipated. I very much hope that this will prove to be the case

for Geoffrey and Jean Newton.
