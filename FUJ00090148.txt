2 Introduction

2.1 Purpose

The content of this document is intended to outline the requirements and process design
for the Deployment of the PO Ltd Financial Systems project. It is intended to act as a
reference for those involved in the various stages of design, development, deployment
and support for the PO Ltd Financial Systems project. It is also intended to support the
concurrence and approval process required for this system to be implemented.

This Conceptual Design will inform, and be updated by, the detailed system design and
build stage of POL FS. During this stage, more detailed analysis will be undertaken to
inform:
The build of POL FS to ensure accurate and timely product accounting, settlement
and reporting to clients;
The requirement for other systems to meet POL product or service related
requirements that cannot be met by the POL FS generic design (e.g. reporting to
clients of information not held in POLFS or Data Warehouse);
Specific reporting requirements; and
Migration plans and activity.

In support of the Detailed Design stage, POL's products and services will need to be
analysed in the context of the sales and stock reporting enhancements available as part
of the overall Impact Programme design. Business decisions will need to be taken so that
individual product offerings can be revised and proposed to clients that provide a
commercially balanced approach to ensuring:

Materially accurate product accounting, client settlement and achievement of

agreed client reporting commitments (as revised); and

Minimal overall cost of reporting and any product verification activity

2.2 Scope

The scope of Release 3 builds on all the requirements and functionality delivered during
Release 1. See Reference document.

The scope of this project is: -

Replacing the auditable financial ledgers of the Post Office Network of Branches, and Cash
and Stock centres currently provided by Class. These ledgers will also hold volumes of
transactions/stock where required.

This will include the following:

« Daily interface from SAP ADS to pick up all financial information from SAP ADS and
hence replacing the current weekly cash account.

« Daily interface files from Horizon that will supply the financial ledgers with branch
activity that has an impact on either financial or stock positions, and hence replace the
weekly cash account.

« Daily interface from WCS to pick up all stock movements to and from the NSSC, to
support control of stock movements and holdings within the POL Network. The
intention is to minimise manual stock reporting

FUJ00090148

Conceptual Design Project: POL FS
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POL/IMPACT/DES/R3029

2.2.1

* Daily interface from STAMPS (manual) /SAP ADS to pick up all Bureau Foreign
Exchange movements in Hemel Cash Centre.

e Periodic interface of Post Office Network financial results to RMG Financial Systems
(ESFS).

« Accounting for, reporting and settlement of client funds in line with contractual
agreements.

« Accounting for amounts to be recovered from current and former Agents and a tool for
effectively managing debt recovery.

« Changes to NRDS to provide reference data to POL FS, and control interfaces
between POL FS and other systems.

« Changes to MIS that are required due to the replacement of the legacy systems.

Exclusions

Amounts that relate to Business income or expense, or assets or liabilities are generally
excluded from these ledgers, and hence this project. Exceptions to this rule are where
these amounts are recorded at Branches on Horizon, or at the cash centre on SAP ADS,
or entered into POL FS due to contractual requirements.

2.3 Background

This document has been produced by Post Office Ltd with the assistance of Fujitsu
Services and Prism Alliance.

The overall IMPACT opportunity was assessed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and Prism
Alliance as part of the 'Working Together' joint working initiative. This initiative comprises
part of the IMPACT programme and is intended to deliver new Financial Ledger
processes to enable a more accurate reflection of the results and position of Post Office
network.

2.4 Document Explanations

2.4.1

Business Process Models

Post Office's High Level functional requirements are represented in the form of IDEF
Process models using Business functions and information flows. The common tool used
for creating these Process Models is Popkin Systems Architect.

Detail Processes are represented in the form of Swimlanes, showing roles, business
process, information flows and relevant technologies. The tool used for creating
Swimlanes is IGRAFX.

Process Models and Detailed Processes are both show in sequence in section 7.

3 Overview

3.1 Business Proposition

The main business proposition is the replacement of CLASS financial Ledgers with more
effective and flexible financial ledgers.

The business drivers behind this are:

General Accounting:

¢ Rationalise systems in place to report client and business information.
Adopting standardised business processes around best practice
To report Business and Client information separately and accurately.
Alignment of management and accounting information
Accounting period alignment — branch currently Wednesday, business Sunday.
Improve timing, accuracy, granularity and summarisation levels.
Establish an appropriate and flexible accounting hierarchy
Performance measures of throughputs and the actual financial debt
Enable proper accounting of cash and stock
To increase accounting control of branches

Cash centre accounting is manual, weekly, therefore no through view from
transaction to settlement.

Client Settlement:

e Significant reduction of losses from remittances and client settlement. Cash
remittance errors will be significantly reduced with the introduction of automated
rems at S60. In the case of stock rems, S80 will provide more timely discrepancy
information, with facilities to enable any subsequent change to automated rems for
these items.

e Long term aim to account and settle on our data, not clients. It is envisaged that
the availability of more timely transaction data will provide benefits for both POL
and its clients to move to settlement based on daily transaction data. Any changes
to settlement arrangements will be made in consideration of the overall Business
benefit, through the involvement of appropriate Business stakeholders.

e Optimisation of cashflow

Exception Handling:

e Reducing resolution time and automating exception handling
¢ Identification of individual discrepancies

Debt Recovery
e Improved Debt Recovery (financial recovery of money), target 95% of debt incurred
e For 2005 the target is reduction of aged debt from 42 to 35 days
¢ Establish a central debt monitoring environment, for both business and transaction
debts, to enable the identification of debt with a high degree of accuracy.
¢ To modify the method of recovering debt by balance rather than each individual
item.

Stock Ledger

FUJ00090148
FUJ00090148

Conceptual Design Project: POL FS
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POL/IMPACT/DES/R3029

e Increased visibility of stock & foreign exchange in the network
* Increase accountability on Postmasters for stock leading to reduced losses
e Support future inventory management practice

3.2. Functional Summary

The following depicts the high level processes and information flows involving these
processes. See Section 7 for High Level Process Diagrams.

3.2.1 General Accounting

The General Ledger will show the balance sheet position of the PO Network. There will be
control accounts linked to the “Client” ledger, “Agent” ledger, and “Stock ledger’. These
control accounts will provide summarised real time information of activity controlled within
these integrated ledgers.

As well as these control accounts the General Ledger Balance Sheet will also show Inter
Company, and “suspense” accounts. There will also be a small element of P&L accounts
for items of Business income and expense that need to be recorded in POL FS.

All this is in addition to the Cash and Bank accounts from Release 1.

3.2.2 Client Ledger

The client ledger will record all activity by product settlement group, branch/cash centre
and trading date. This information will be interfaced from Horizon or SAP ADS as
appropriate.
The product settlement group is a group of client products that are settled under the same
contractual terms, and such that the client does not need additional analysis at time of
settlement.

Where settlement is based on estimated or client data this information will be entered into
the client ledger at an appropriate level of detail.

The client ledger will provide basic matching/comparison functionality between estimated
or client data, and actual data interfaced from Horizon. The ability to match data from
clients is limited to branch and trading day for each client product, subject to POL FS
recording daily summarised transactions by the individual product.

The client ledger will also provide control and management of the settlement process and
reconciliation (including transaction volumes) of contractual client documents such as
National Audit Office statements.

3.2.3. Agent Ledger

The Agent Ledger will provide a permanent account for each current and former PO
Agents including the ability to group branches under a single franchise or a multiple
contract.

Branch Transaction Corrections will be entered in the Agent ledger and interfaced to
Horizon for action by the Agent.

The Agent ledger will facilitate reporting and management of debt recovery from all
Agents.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POL/IMPACT/DES/R3029

3.2.4 Stock Recording and Accounting

Stock is recorded in Materials Management (MM) module of POL FS. Where stock has a
balance sheet value this value will also appear in the relevant stock control accounts in the
General ledger.

Most of the stock quantity activity will be interfaced from Horizon daily as part of the
financial activity in each branch. Stock activity incorporates remittances into and out of
branches, “sales”, and adjustments/write offs.

Activity of stock from NSSC, Hemel, will also be input into MM. It is planned that the new
WCS system will provide an electronic interface of this information. If this does not occur
then this information will be input manually as it is today.

4 Constraints

The requirements throughout this document are generic to all suppliers unless stated
otherwise. Gaps in the requirement numbers represent requirements that have been
removed, and the numbering has been retained for clarity.

4.1 High Level Functional

Ref Requirement Description

FIH 001 Introduction of a new financial system (POL FS) to produce the financial ledgers for
Post Office Ltd (POL) to report to Royal Mail Group using simplified business
processes and reduced duplication and requirement for reconciliation

FIH 002 Introduction of a Client Ledger, Agent Ledger, Stock Ledger to enable standard
procedures for Debt Recovery and monitoring. To enable the capture, validation,
verification and correction of client transaction data.

FIH 003 Produce POL Ledgers to report P&L and BS for POL in so far as the transactions
are handled within the POL environment with a stream of data from branches and
cash centres

FIH 004 The Cash and Bank account values, from ledger implemented in S60, will not be
overwritten with CLASS values at S80 implementation. A reconciliation will be
undertaken between POL FS and CLASS as part of cutover activities

4.2 Dependencies and Assumptions

Ref Description
ASS 001 I Supplementary document matching will not take place in POL FS and will largely be
stopped.

ASS 002 I Matching of client transaction data to POL FS data will not take place on POL FS.
This will take place in MI where necessary.

ASS 003 I Matching of client summary data to POL FS data will be done on a risk based
approach.

ASS 008 I Reporting of data to clients from POL FS will be at the maximum level of Branch,
Trading Day & Product.

ASS 004 I Reporting of transaction data to clients will not take place on POL FS. This
information will either be fed to clients directly (e.g. AP/Banking), or is available from
MI.

ASS 005 I Depending upon where it resides at the time of S80 implementation, Foreign
Exchange movements to/from cash centres will be received by POL FS either by an
automated feed from SAP ADS or by the manual input of output from STAMPS.
ASS 006 I Client managers will be involved in establishing revised product propositions in
response to changes being introduced by Impact. Legacy systems may need to be
retained if they provide non POL FS related services to clients that cannot be
managed away.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Doc Ref: POL/IMPACT/DES/R3029

CHH 003 I SAP/ADS to make available, by cash centre, to the POL Financial System the
summarised daily client related transactions, (value and volume), by client for entry into
the client ledger

CHH 004 I SAP/ADS to undertake the summarisation of required data, to an agreed level, prior to
entry into the cash and client ledgers.

CHH 005 I The interface will provide all transactions which affect cash and near cash values of the
cash centre. For example: -

Inward and Outward to POL

Inward and Outward to FI’s

Inward and Outward to Customers/Clients
Inward and Outward to 3 Party

Cash centre adjustments

Cash centre discrepancies

CHH 006 I The interface will provide a snapshot of all transactions at approx midnight and must be
available within the POL FS by 07:30 the following day

CH 001 The Cash Centre Trading Statement will replace the current cash account process.

The statement is an internal document for the cash centre only and will not be forwarded
to an independent area unless security and audit determine that that is essential. The
actual data within the trading statement will have already populated the ledgers by the
daily interface outlined above and therefore no data from the statement will populate the
interface.

The trading statement will encompass a snapshot of cash and stock and also any
current discrepancies or suspense items. It will also enable the cash centre to view what
business has been transacted over the last period. The cash centre manager will be
required to “sign off” the trading statement as a true and accurate position at specified
points in time.

It is possible that the SAP/ADS system can produce the level of information required
which would satisfy both control issues and security and audit requirements.
The Trading Statement is being developed independently of POL FS by CL&S.

8 Business Processes

8.1 A3 Stock Management

POL FS is a recording and accounting system for stock management that occurs on systems
outside POL FS.

The NSSC is currently going through a project implementing a stock warehouse system called
Yantra. The associated Warehouse Control System (WCS) will provide information on stock

movements to/from the NSSC and holdings at the NSSC.

Stock at Branches is controlled on Horizon.

POL FS will receive stock receipt, despatch and write off information from WCS. The assumption

is that there will be a daily electronic feed of cash centre stock movements from WCS.

If the

electronic feed out of WCS is not developed then this information will be entered into POL FS

manually.

All stock information from Horizon will be passed in the Summarised Branch Data process below.

8.2 A43 Summarise Transaction Data

8.2.1. Summarised Branch Data

The process feeding into POL Ledgers is by a daily interface from Horizon.

442010 Client sends transaction information to POL. This is at a low level of detail. This

can be sent by email, fax or disc/tape.

442040 I Transaction information is received. Transaction Processing require detailed
data for comparing client data to data recorded on Horizon. The data is loaded

onto Management Information system.

Where discrepancies are identified, this will be a trigger into the Discrepancy
Process to determine whether the tolerance /threshold levels have been
exceeded and, if so, the action to be taken

442020 I From the data received from the client, summarised information is generated and
loaded onto POL/FS. Settlement team does not require detail information for

settlement to clients

442021 I The information provided by the client may include a summary total. Where this
is the case, the Settlement team compare summarised data total (generated
above) and compare to the client-provided summarised total. If there is a

mismatch, then the client is notified.

442030 I Summarised totals (By Settlement Group By Period) are entered into Client
Holding Account. This sets up the amounts due on a particular day to each
client.

However, this will be a trigger into the Discrepancy and Resolve Discrepancy
Processes to determine whether the tolerance/threshold levels (at business total
level) have been exceeded and, if so, the action to be taken

The precise requirements of client data feeds will be defined during the system design phase.

8.3.2 A443 Calculate and Settle on Estimated Amounts

Activity Description

443010 Estimate falls due. The estimation cycle and period is different for
each client — e.g. Girobank estimates on a monthly cycle; BBC.
estimates are on a 3 — 4 day cycle.

443020 Local Business Knowledge. This activity involves the ongoing
collection of information relating to an individual client. This includes
knowledge of business cycles, public holiday effects, and trend in
business.

443030 Product change Process. This process is outside the scope of this
swimlane but specifically feeds into the local business knowledge in
the settlement dept.

443040 Combine inputs is the activity of bringing together all the information
that is used to calculate the estimate(s)

443050 Calculate estimate(s)

443060 Inform client in advance. The estimated payments are communicated

to the client. This is currently manual.

443070 Agree Payment amount. The estimated payments are mutually
agreed between POL and client. Some clients are more proactive
than others in agreeing the estimates.

443080 Negotiate payment value

443090 Enter into Client Ledger on POL FS to generate payments.
This will involve a journal with both sides going to the Client a/c.

The payment value will be posted to the payment area of the Client a/c
and the balancing entry will be posted to the comparison area of the
Client a/c.

8.3.3 A444 Discrepancy Process — Errors identified by Clients

Activity Description

444100 Paperwork is sent by each branch on a daily/weekly basis to clients

444120 Client is sent electronic summary information based daily transaction
summaries. (Currently sent weekly)

444110 On receipt of the paper work and the electronic information, the client

444130 carries out their own matching and verification (using their own systems)

444140 Where errors are identified, then the client notifies POL of errors and send
any appropriate supporting evidence to POL (Girobank also adjusts

444150 settlement)
The errors are investigated as part of the A45 Resolve Discrepancies
process

444185 The investigation undertaken in the Resolve Discrepancies process may
result in there being errors in the errors summary provided by the client. In
this case, the summary errors are sent back to the client (via fax, e-mail or
disc/tape) with the reason for return

444220 The investigation undertaken in the Resolve Discrepancies process may
result in the error not being identified and necessitate the paperwork being
returned to the client with the reason for return

444190 On receipt of the returned summary errors (from 444185), the client
investigates and makes adjustments to the errors and supporting
documentation. If necessary, the client re-issues the error(s) (via 444150)

444193 Client (Girobank) adjusts settlement expected.

444230 On receipt of the returned paperwork, the client investigates and reissues
the error (via 444150) if the discrepancy is correct.

444240 Where the client investigation results in the acknowledgment that the error

should not have been issued, then a charge or claim error notice is issued to
POL

8.3.4 A444 Client Discrepancy

Activity Description

444010 Actual Horizon data is received into SAP — the data is summarised by
Branch by Settlement Group By Period

444020 Client data is received into SAP

444030 The Client holding account is reviewed at business total level.

444040 This includes looking at the tolerance / thresholds set and determining
whether these have been exceeded or not (at a business total level).
Where the differences are within the tolerance / threshold level, then
no further action needs to be taken.
However, where they have been exceeded, then the process moves
onto activity 444050

444050 A check is made on the client discrepancy information held (this

information is not held on POL-FS — see process A443 and associated
support swimlane document)

The detailed client discrepancy information is held by branch by
product by period. This is investigated and the process may then move

8.3.5 A445 Resolve Exceptions

The key feature of the Resolve Exceptions process is the Transaction Correction. This is the
electronic version of the Error Notice. The Transaction Correction will be raised against the
Agent Accounts Receivable account with sufficient information to identify:

Client product being adjusted

Suspense type being adjusted

Requirement for any write off

Options for resolution by the Agent — make good, request hardship, request more
evidence

Information for the Agent so that they are aware of the impact of each option

Horizon will interpret this information to provide an intelligent interface at the branch to carry the
appropriate transactions based on the option chosen by the agent.

Definitions

The term “branch” is used here to cover all the different types of branches — directly-managed,
franchised, community, singleton, local multiples, national multiples.

The process covers all these types of branches — however, there is a difference in the way
Transaction Corrections are handled for Multiple branches and this is reflected in the swim lane
document and the activity descriptions below.

8.3.5.1 Resolve Exceptions

Activity Description

445000 Discrepancies identified at the Cash Centres (for example, through mismatch on
Girobank deposits or pouches received from branches) are recorded onto SAPADS.
The information is then sent to POL-FS

445001 A discrepancy has been identified (and this can be by POL, the branch, the client or a
customer)
445002 Identification at the branch of Rem-Iin discrepancies which has occurred in Cash

Delivery between the branch and Cash Centre

445005 Acheck is made on the client discrepancy system (see process A442 and associated
swimlane support document).

This is a “threshold investigation” to identify any branches which have exceeded the
tolerance/threshold level

N.B. This is a review which takes place on an on-going basis

445010 This involves looking at the past history of the agent in terms of exceptions already
identified (and possibly written-off or currently being progressed by Debt Recovery) —

445020 plus the trend and history for the particular branch, client, product or service.
N.B. This is a review which takes place on an on-going basis

445030 If the exception is a “surplus” then it may be required to net this off against outstanding
“shortages” if a Transaction Correction is eventually raised.

445040 Record exception against Branch/Agent — precise method of recording to be

determined.

Accheck is made on whether the exceptions identified result in the threshold being
exceeded (this takes into account previous exceptions and Transaction Correction
outstanding).

445055

Where the discrepancies are not sufficient to exceed the threshold level, then
adjustments are made to the agent ledger to indicate that the discrepancy has been
investigated and is below the threshold level

445056
445057

A periodic review is undertaken of adjustments due to discrepancies and these may be
written off

8.3.5.2

Transaction Corrections — Singleton/Franchise Branches

445060

Where threshold levels have been exceeded, then these need to be investigated (via
A444 - Discrepancy Process)

Where initial investigations result in determining that the initial findings were incorrect,
then the process may move onto 445055, 445056, and 445057 (described in the above
2 rows)

This process is also appropriate where the branch or Nominee dispute the Transaction
Correction, by using the Request More Evidence option. This may result in the process
moving onto 445055, 445056, and 445057 (described in the above 2 rows) or a new
(amended) Transaction Correction being issued

445080

Investigations result in a Transaction Correction being issued to the Branch. This is
issued electronically via POL-FS to Horizon

The Transaction Correction will include the appropriate instructions for the branch
manager (as is the case currently for Error Notices)

445085

Unresolved Transaction Corrections will also be regularly reviewed. This should not be
left to the end of Branch Trading Periods or Financial Period ends.

This activity will lead to Exceptions Handling chasing up Branches who have substantial
outstanding Transaction Corrections. (May involve Retail Line)

445090

The Branch manager (at non-Multiples and Multiples) checks on Horizon each day for
the receipt of any Transaction Corrections

445100

The Branch Manager (non-Multiples) or the Nominee (Multiples) dispute the Transaction
Corrections

Transaction Corrections can only be disputed once (on initial issue)
Non-Multiples indicate this via Horizon — Nominees will do so via post/mail.

Where the Nominee accepts the Transaction Correction, then the Nominee can make
the appropriate payment (via Debit or Credit Card or BACS). This is via the process
outlined in process A47 (see swimlane for this process plus the associated swimlane
support document)

445110

Where the Transaction Correction is disputed, more evidence is obtained and further
investigations are undertaken.

Where necessary, further evidence is obtained and the Transaction Correction issued

However, investigations may also result in the Transaction Correction being
cancelled/withdrawn and the process moving onto 445055, 445056, and 445057 (see
above) or a new (amended) Transaction Correction being issued

445120

The Branch Manager accepts the Transaction Correction

For non-Multiples, acceptance is indicated on Horizon via one of the following two
activities.

8.3.6 A446 Authorise and Make Payments

Activity Description

The trigger points for this process are from the following processes:
« A442 —Summarise Client Data
« A443 - Calculate Estimated Amounts For Settlement
« A444 - Exceptions Handling — Client Discrepancy
e A445 - Resolve Discrepancy
e A47 - Debt Recovery
POL data will include any adjustments made during the above processes

446010 Review balance outstanding on client ledger to obtain settlement value (actual or
estimated) and if necessary, enter values into client ledger to deduct commission
or make other adjustments.

446020 Create system (on-line) payment proposal(s) for the payment(s) due. The
creation is controlled by client standing data (see below for the types of
information for inclusion in the standing data which will enable this to be
controlled)

446025 This is an on-going process and one which includes making changes to client
standing data. The client standing data contains the following types of
information for each client:

¢ Client name
¢ Client Product
¢ Client Bank Details

e Payment Method (currently, this is I for CHAPS, E for BACS and C for
Cheques, Swift, Direct Debit (receipts))

e Settlement Terms — (e.g. Next Day; Week in arrears etc)
« Source of Settlement (e.g. POL Data, Client Estimate, Client Actual)

The Client standing data then is a control for the raising of the payment

that the payment is in line with the contract, settlement is due, that the payment
proposal contains the correct standing data, etc. Refer to business rules being
determined

446050

Payment proposal to be verified on-line — this check is to ensure that the
settlement amount is reasonable and any deviation from the normal amounts is
acceptable and explainable. Refer to business rules being determined.

446060
446070

Amounts due to be paid are discussed between the Team Leader and Manager
where necessary and fully verified. This may be because the amounts vary
drastically from the “normal” trend / range.

446080

Where the team Leader deems the amount to be unreasonable or “beyond the
norm”, then the payment proposal will need to be adjusted as agreed during the
discussions above

446090

Approval of payment allows the payment to be made

446095

Information is received by the Cashiers section on the funding required for the
approved payments. This is provided by payment method

(There is a break-out here into the “Funding Process” (which is out-of-scope).
This process is where the cashiers ensure that the funding to make the
approved payments is in place)

446096

The Payment Authorisers authorise the payment. This allows the payment to be
sent electronically via BACS or CHAPS, Swift. Receipts may be by Direct
Debit.

For Cheque payments (which should be the exception), the cheques are printed
(via a Cheque Printer)

Current authorisation procedure is as follows:

e Where the payment amount is less than £50,000, there is a one-step
authorisation

« Where the payment amount is £50,000 or greater, there is a two-step
authorisation

It is assumed that this will procedure will remain in POL-FS

446097

The printed cheques are then checked for correctness and accuracy and signed
and sent to the client

446098

Remittance advices, showing volume and value by product, are printed and sent
to the client — where the payment is by cheque, the remittance advice is sent
with the cheque.

Verification was identified as a specific process stream at the high level design phase. It was
established during a detailed design scoping period that verification is individual activities that are
part of all the other process streams, such as settlement, and product POL Ledger.

The process illustrated as process A466 was covered as part of the debt recovery process.

8.5.1 Exceptions Identified by Client or Customer

Activity Description

466001 This is the start point of the process. The exception is identified by

466002 either the client or the customer.

466003 Evidence is submitted by the client or the customer — for the customer,

466004 this may be, for example, a till receipt or a utility bill stamped and

8.6.1.1 Deduction From Remuneration

Activity Description

470000 This is the start point of the process. A Transaction Correction has been actioned in a
Branch and the amount due will be collected centrally.

470010 The debt is not considered in isolation. Previous debts and debt history is taken into
account to determine the total amount owing at this time. Additionally, consideration is
also given to the following:

«The level of difficulty experienced in the past to recover money;
e Previous hardship cases;

e Problems with making payments or payments made

470030 Debt Recovery section issue a statement of account of outstanding debt.

This is not a one-off activity at the start of the debt recovery process. The statement of
debt will be issued on a regular basis/frequency to notify the Postmaster or the Nominee
of the current outstanding debt amount (level of itemisation is to be determined — current
thinking is that it is a summary of each debt total).

N.B. For the Nominee, the statement is a Multiples Statement (see swimlane
process A455 — Resolve Exceptions plus the associated swimlane support
document)

470040 The Postmaster or Nominee receives the statement of debt, via the Post service.

8.7.1 A484 Branch Liability Management

The process of managing Branch Liability as part of POL FS is largely a reporting and monitoring
process.

All financial information that relates to a branch will be recorded such that the branch is identified
as a parameter in the financial ledgers. A full balance sheet by branch will be available.

This will allow the Retail Line Managers to report on Branch Liability with information that is only a
day old. Where this coincides with the end of a Branch Trading Period then there will be close
correlation between the Branch Trading Statement created on Horizon and any information
reported from POL FS.

The information that is recorded in POL FS is based on a particular end of day cut off and, since,
this is not necessarily the same as the cut off point as for the Branch Trading Statement the two
reports will also have some timing differences. It is therefore recommended that no reconciliation
is attempted between the Horizon and POL FS versions of the Liability Statement.

8.9 Management & Accounting Information

8.9.1 Standard Within POL FS

All Management/ Accounting information in POL FS is limited based on the granularity of data
recorded in POL FS.

Although POL FS will capture summary level information of Branch and Cash Centre client
transactions, it is not the key role of POL FS to provide Management Information relating to client
activity. This is the role of MIS. POL FS will provide reports suitable to an auditable standard but
this is not Management Information.

POL FS key role relating to the recording of client data is for settlement.

POL FS will provide a variety of reports that are standard within the SAP system. There will also
be some specific reports that will be built based on POL requirements. The standard reports
are listed below are anticipated as being useful to the business. Also listed are other reports that
will have to be developed specifically to business requirements.

Client Related:

«Value of indebtedness to clients both individually and in total Standard
« Value of client indebtedness to POL both individually and in total Standard
« Age of indebtedness both individually and in total Standard
« Payment History Standard

Reporting Requirements From POL FS
The following requirements were identified in the Programme CD relating to data available

in POL FS

These requirements were based on extracting the current information requirements from

the reports that are currently run on CBDB/OPTIP.

Further work needs to be done to establish how these requirements translate into
requirements against new processes and data. It is therefore probable that not all details
of these information requirements will be delivered in the way described below.

10.1.2 Numbers of Users

For release 3 there will be 350 named users with a concurrency of 20%, where concurrency is
defined as users logged onto the system and have been active within the last 30 minutes. Users
that have been inactive for more than 30 minutes will be automatically logged off.

The end-to-end POL FS system should be designed to cater for this population of users, including
presentation, wide area network and hosting.

10.2 Sizing Assumptions
17000- 18000 documents will be received nightly, in approximately 60 files, from Horizon.

Approximately 20 documents will be received nightly in a single file from SAP ADS.

Both these must be processed by 0730 on day B; where day A = Trading day

10.3 Service Levels

Reviews of this service will be held at agreed intervals, typically monthly. The reviews with
each of Prism Alliance and Fujitsu Services, will be attended by the service managers from
POL, together with appropriate operational and technical managers. The reviews will
consider the service performance against the OLA and SLA; the impact of any forecast
service changes; open problems and any service improvements.

Availability and Reliability
The availability of the online SAP service is to be measured between 07:30-19:30 on
Monday-Friday (excl. Bank Holidays).

The service will be measured in 2 parts:
«the host service
« the presentation service

Host Service

«The host service is defined as being available if the SAP host system is available to be
logged into and there are no overnight data load jobs still processing.

« The target availability is to be 98.5% (this equates to an average of 4 hours outage per
month)

« The maximum downtime permitted during a single outage is 4 hours.

This service level target is to be measured over a period of 1 quarter

« Although the service is not measured at the weekends or bank holidays, it is expected that
the service should be available 7 days per week (07:30-19:30), except by agreement. The
windows between 19:30 to 07:30 is available for batch processing

« Support for the Service should be available during the hours of service measurement i.e.
07:30-19:30 Mon-Fri (excl. Bank Holidays)

«lt is expected that the host service should be monitored using standard SAP functionality
and that the reporting should fit in within the reporting framework for Horizon.

The client/network service is defined as the SAP client and the associated local area
networking to reach access to the service boundary’ at Huthwaite. This is covered with
another agreement.

Data Delivery Times

It is envisaged that the data delivery times will align with current LFS delivery times,
although this needs to be confirmed. Reference the SLA and associated liquidated
damages where relevant are stated in Schedule 15.

In particular, the feed from Horizon of daily cash on hand details may require some
strengthening to the current data delivery times which exist for transaction data to TIP. It
may be necessary to strengthen this (for example, utilising the current cash on hand
delivery SLA with Fujitsu supplemented by a further SLA with PRISM to ensure the end to
end processing time is met to match the standards of delivery to SAP ADS) in order to
deliver the benefits of increased control over cash movements on a daily basis. This needs
to be confirmed.

The end to end delivery time to the ledgers must also be reviewed to ensure that both the
delivery of data by Fujitsu and any subsequent processing necessary within the POL FS
ledger is completed by the time reliable ledger information is required.

The resulting reliability of the ledger entries must be maintained, i.e. the completeness of
the daily cash figures arising from the percentage delivery of transactions must be
consistent with existing levels of completeness of the current weekly cash figures.

The working assumption is that file deliveries will be in line with current deliveries:
« SAPADS file to be available to POL-FS to enable process completion by 07:30
« Horizon file to be available on the SAP host at 03:00
« All other data to be loaded into POL FS to be made available by 03:00
¢ New reference data to POL FS.
¢ Stock movements from WCS to POL FS

It is a requirement to have all the data loaded by 07:30.

The service level target is that no more than 3 failures to meet this criteria should be allowed
in any quarter.

This measurement will exclude failures caused by:
>» SAPADS files being made available after 04:00
> Failures caused by incorrect functioning of Prism application code or incorrect
configuration of the POL FS application (e.g. missing FAD)
The service level will be reviewed during the service level discussions on network banking,
where service targets may be moving to annually rather than quarterly

The following files should be produced on POL FS by midnight to enable data to be sent to
the target systems and loaded by 07:30:

>» From POL FS to ESFS

Transaction information from POL FS to clients

Transaction information from POL FS to NS&l

From POL FS to new ref data

Transaction correction files to TMS

Help desks
Helpdesk support for POL FS will need to be agreed, and where necessary links between
all three systems for Helpdesk support should be established.

Service level reports

Service Level reports should be produced in line with current service level and operational
level reporting, and will be discussed at a relevant forum.

NB The resulting solution (end to end across all boundaries and suppliers, from initial data
capture to final data delivery) should not significantly impact the run times of the current
batch process, and Current operational achievements should still be met.

Service Fault Diagnosis

Key components of the system should be monitored and alerts raised if there are problems.
Diagnostic tools should be created, so that in the event of a failure, it will be possible to
identify where problems are occurring in the end-to-end service.

The boundary between Fujitsu managed systems and Prism managed systems needs to be
monitored to enable the cause of problems to be swiftly diagnosed

10.5 Business Continuity
Host Service
There must be contingency arrangements in place for the POL FS service.
The maximum outage during failover is 48 hours
At the end of failover the data must be fully restored, but the system can run with a reduced
service in terms of:
¢ the number of supported users
*® end-user response times
« — the time by which data loads have to be complete

Presentation Service

A disaster affecting the Huthwaite site will require failover of the presentation service (ITS and
workplace servers). During failover the presentation service should be capable of supporting 30
users, and printing may be required.

10.6 Training
Additional training is required for all POL Central finance and Transaction processing staff
who are identified as users on the POL Ledgers.

In addition to technical training it is important that these staff are given process awareness
training so they understand how their roles fit into the end to end process and what the
dependencies are.

Training will be carried out by POL, but there is a requirement on Prism to provide
Knowledge Transfer of the new system and processes.

11.2 Architecture Principles

11.2.1 Application

POL FS is to be built using SAP R3 V4.7 Enterprise with a based of the Retail Industry
Solution.

11.2.2 Resilience
The solution should be resilient to a single point of failure.

11.2.3 Performance

The requirement is for the ability to monitor the response times of a limited number of OLTP
transactions at the back end. When combined with monitoring of network response times this will
provide Post Office with a view of the overall response times. It is expected that standard SAP
functionality should meet the SAP back-end monitoring requirements.

There are 2 specific performance requirements:

e The service level target is for the average response time of the agreed transactions to be
completed within:
"1.5 - <WAN latency>" seconds.
where this measure is taken within the hosting environment (excluding WAN and
presentation layers).
« loading of data files as defined in the data delivery section of 10.3
Capacity management of the platform should be brought into the standard Horizon capacity
management regime.

11.2.4 Communications

Connectivity of the end-user presentation layer to the POL FS hosting service is to be channelled
through Post Office's Northern Data Centre

11.2.5 Scalability
The solution must be scalable to cope with release 3, specifically in the following areas:

e Audit - For release 3 it is expected that there will 90 days worth of online details, with records
being archived periodically

« Volumes - See section 10.1

« Numbers of users - 350 users at release 3 with 20% concurrency

The design proposal should explain how the solution will cope with an increase in the following:

« number of end users

* number of concurrent end users

¢ input data volumes

* online data volumes

whilst maintaining the contracted service levels. These will constitute the design limits in
accordance with the approach defined in PA/PER/033.

11.2.6 Systems Management

POL FS infrastructure is expected to be part of Horizon domain and managed as such, including
initiation and control of batch jobs.

Bespoke processes such as the jobs that process the files fed from Horizon should be monitored.

It is not expected that test systems will need to set date/time to be something different from the
current date/time.

The following service level monitoring is required

« the ability to monitor the response times of a limited number of OLTP transactions at the back

domain

All production and test end-user access will be via ITS and workplace.
Development access will be via SAP GUI (on citrix servers)

File transfer access to development and test is required for developers.

12 Security Requirements

The principle is that Horizon data centre and Huthwaite are both trusted domains and should be
operating to ISO 17799. The SAP host should be integrated into the Horizon domain as per the

principle defined in Section 5.

The requirements for security then focus on the changes brought about by the introduction of the
new SAP service and the interfaces between the 2 secure data centres. For each of these areas
consideration should be given to Identification and Authentication, Access Controls, Audit and

Alarms.

¢ SAP Application

> All persons requiring access to the POL ledgers will have individual user ID with specific

access suitable for their requirements.

>» User roles will be set up and administered in line with Consignia's "Security Operating

13.2 Prism Alliance

13.2.1 POL FS Development

Prism Alliance should develop a design proposal to meet the requirements set out in this
document and provide the post office with a commercial proposal which will specify the
costs, time-scales and resource implications for progressing to the solution build and test
stage, and the implementation and rollout stage.

13.2.2 SAPADS Development

There was an initial assumption that there would be no changes required for SAP ADS.
Since several processes start on SAP ADS and finish outside SAP ADS it is necessary to
pick up these transactions individually. It is not easy to do this and keep the financial
integrity of an interface without making some changes to SAP ADS.

Prism Alliance will investigate and recommend changes to SAP ADS that do not effect the
key operation of the Cash Centres but will ensure financial integrity of SAP ADS and the
interface to POL FS.

Refer to Release 3 and S80 project plans

14.2 Dependencies
The Financial ledgers are dependent on the completion of the Branch Trading Development
in order to provide accurate data and enable effective operation of the Transaction

Correction process.

There is a dependency on SAPADS to ensure that there is a feed of cash centre related
data

There is a dependency on the New Reference Data System to provide an interface
mapping tool to control the interfaces between Horizon and POL FS. The majority of
mapping relating to this interface will take place in Horizon.

15 Acceptance

Acceptance takes place upon determining that the Automated Cash & Bank ledgers solution is fit
for purpose. Acceptance for each Requirement will be conducted by one or more of the following
methods: -

1. Document review

This method will comprise a document review by Post Office Ltd. of the relevant section
of a document or documents. The classification and contractual status of any documents
used for this purpose will remain unchanged.

2. Post Office Test

This method will comprise tests that run and managed by Post Office Ltd. The actual
method of testing, which may utilise the Post Office Ltd. End-to-End test environment, will
typically be used for those aspects of the solution that can only be verified as part of an
overall Post Office End-to-End environment. The Post Office Test could also include
document review.

3. Statement of fact or obligation

This classification will be used for those Requirements that represent an existing Prism
obligation, or where the solution to a Requirement is self-evident and does not lend itself
to formal proving.

16 Testing

NB: E2E references within this section refer to E2E testing and not the E2E Programme.

16.1.1 Testing Statement
The testing plan will be based around the following PO Ltd testing statement

Testing will be able to confirm the acceptance criteria for some requirements have been
met during the various test phases. The criteria and the targeted test phase should be
identified during the requirements analysis phase. The testing team should assess the
testability of the acceptance criteria during the Requirements reviews.

An appropriate Test Strategy will be developed to reflect the release contents.

This will include some or all of the following testing phases.

16.1.2 Internal Functional Testing
Gaining assurance of main suppliers internal functional testing via: -
o Review suppliers internal test plans/ scripts for completeness
o Review suppliers internal test results / progress reports
o Review suppliers internal testing fault logs for impact

16.1.3 Non Functional Testing
Due to the nature of this type of testing the aim would be to achieve this via engagement
with the supplier in: -

Supplier document reviews

Review of supplier test plans / scripts for completeness

Witness specific key tests during a supplier testing cycle

Review supplier test results

Review supplier test fault logs for impact

00000

16.1.4 Interface Testing
Lead or Support Suppliers through the execution of Direct Interface testing between two
suppliers e.g. Lead - Horizon to SAP/ADS
o Review or develop and agree Interface scripts between two supplier domains
Support or coordinate set — up of test environments
Support or coordinate the provision of Required Ref Data
Support or execute where appropriate the tests
Review the test results including any faults

16.1.5 E2E Integration Testing

This phase is where POL would lead, supported by suppliers, in demonstrating the
successful connection of all the appropriate systems (test versions) in the releases E2E
solution including carrying out some E2E test transactions to confirm the readiness to
enter the POL E2E functional testing cycles.

16.1.6 E2E Functional Testing

This phase is where POL would lead, supported by suppliers, in demonstrating through
short “days in the life of the POL business” cycles that the revised systems interact
correctly in an E2E manner and with the revised business process and procedures.

This is also to assure POL that the changes to current systems and the introduction of
new systems has not impacted upon the businesses operation including E2E financial
aspects (accounting, reconciliation, settlement, remuneration) have been and can
maintained during live operation. E2E Management Information is maintained or new
information reflects the requirements and business needs.

Successful completion of this phase would lead to the introduction into the live
environment via one or more of the following: -

© apre-pilot (transactions carried out in the passive Post Office)

© pilot (small number of outlets)

© go-live.( rolled out to the full estate)

16.1.7 Pre-Pilot

This final testing phase is whereby a “live” Post Office is used to test that the connectivity
of the live E2E systems has been achieved and that a small number of transactions
representing the changes can be carried out and report correctly in accounting and
management information terms. Completion of this final phase should be the point of
handover to the Implementation team / phase.

17 Implementation & Migration

17.1 Co-ordination of the feeds into POL FS

General

The migration of the financial ledgers from CBDB to POL FS must occur as at the end of
a financial period. The start of all feeds into POL FS must be consistent with this
chosen date.

Horizon

The roll out approach of S80 Horizon will govern the cutover strategy required to ensure
that reconciling items are not investigated unnecessarily.

SAP ADS

The feed from SAP ADS will be turned on as a single event rather than cash centre by
cash centre. It is important to co-ordinate this financial period end.

within the trading statement will have already populated the ledgers by the daily interface
outlined above and therefore no data from the statement will populate the interface.

The trading statement will encompass a snapshot of cash and stock and also any current
discrepancies or suspense items. It will also enable the cash centre to view what business has
been transacted over the last period. The cash centre manager will be required to “sign off”
the trading statement as a true and accurate position at specified points in time.

It is possible that the SAP/ADS system can produce the level of information required which

19 Appendix B - Impact Stakeholder Forum Design Principles

Principles/ Working Assumptions for discrepancies

« All discrepancies under £250 should be made good at point of identification. It should not
be possible to key a value of less than £250 into the suspense account. Therefore the
quantity of discrepancies flowing up to the ledger should be significantly reduced

« Transaction corrections required by the branch will be automatically sent to Horizon via a
flat file from POL/FS. This will contain information regarding the correction to be made and
how to carry out the correcting transaction

« The correction should be automatic or with minimal intervention (this needs to be
confirmed with FJS and may not be possible)

« Transaction corrections which are not undertaken within stipulated timescales will create
an exception report from POL/FS in order to aid any further investigation

« Transaction corrections supplied by client e.g. Girobank should be automatically
communicated to branch irrespective of value if evidence is available

e Errors identified by client, such as gas bill not paid, should be automatically communicated

to branch irrespective of value if evidence is available

e If the agent request for the value to be taken from salary the Horizon system should have
an icon which would move into “recovery account” therefore clearing the agent suspense.
This would flow into agent debt in the ledger and remove from suspense in the ledger

e For multiples it should be possible to “clear” the error in the same way as above in order
for the debt recovery teams to invoice the “nominee” direct.

e For directly managed branches the transaction correction will always adjust from suspense
to recovery account and then be written off in the ledger.

« The use of a recovery account within Horizon will reduce, or potentially remove, the need
for write off vouchers and REM vouchers. This will lead to efficiencies.

« The differing scenarios for transaction corrections e.g. multiples, directly managed will be

managed by reference data.

« Former subpostmaster debt will be held as agent debt in the ledger. At the point of
resignation any value in suspense will be moved to agent debt.

Principles/ Working Assumptions for stock

¢ Horizon will record volumes/ quantities only for all transactions, except on sale, or loss,
transactions when it will additionally record value.

e For Balance Sheet Stock — SAP will record data at lower level product information
(example Orange £ 5, £ 10...) whereas for Non-Balance Sheet Stock — Higher level
product information should suffice. Hence, Horizon will need to provide this level of
information. (Yet to investigate this for Hemel)

e« We have assumed rem-in and rem-out for all products and no products/ stock items will
be excluded.

« Line item (product level) details will be available (yet to investigate this for Hemel) to report
on stock in transit (both -stock from Hemel and stock to branches) Tracking of stock in
transit is out of scope for Impact programme.

«Unit of Measure for all transactions on Horizon will be the retail sales unit of measure.

Principles/ Working Assumptions for settlements

« Vendor accounts should be set up using standard SAP functionality

e For clients paid on estimates the principle of a “holding” account will apply

« For client paid on their data, currently matched via OpTip, will only be matched if deemed
high risk eg Lottery. Low risk clients will be paid on their data however the variances will
be recorded at a high level and if variances reach tolerance limit further investigation will
take place

e Any client data matching will take place outside of POL/FS
