Please see the numbers below that I have given to BIS

Richard called me earlier for an update:

I said that Mark D was drafting the letter and looking at the PN and other docs over the weekend and that
you (Mark) were aware of their timetable

He asked about the content. I suggested it was likely to be short and factual (I hope that was ok)

BIS have asked that we let them know that it is ok to table the WMS title by 5pm on Monday - in theory this
could be done as late as 10pm (as it is a Monday) but apparently the Parliamentary Branch want to go home!
I pointed out that just as the title can be tabled at any point in the Parliamentary day, so can the statement
itself. So it must be co-ordinated with when we make our announcement (I explained the importance in
terms of stakeholder management)

I said that Mike was drafting an alternative WMS in the unlikely event that it was needed.

My impression is all is relatively calm on the BIS front

In terms of numbers:
26 cases are with CEDR awaiting mediation
80 cases are live within the Scheme
- 37 are criminal, 43 are not
- So we are looking at mediating a further 69 cases (43+26)

Please let me know if you need anything else

We have had a readout from Jo. Apologies for brevity, on my smartphone:

Broadly content with approach

Can she see the press notice and lines to take that POL will use in advance please?

How many of the 109(?) cases remaining are criminal ones that you would not mediate?

She is minded to lay a WMS but to keep our distance would like it to just say that she had received a letter from
Paula/POL on the scheme (the day before the WMS) and she is laying a copy in the house library. We therefore need a
letter from you very early on day minus one, and we'll need a reserve WMS in case we pull out at the last moment.

Thanks, happy to discuss first thing tomorrow morning.
