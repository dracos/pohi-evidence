Subject: POL Memo from Perm Sec

Attachment: 050318_Memo_ACtoSoSPOL.pdf
Hi,

On Monday Alex spoke to SoS about issues with POL and has since written the attached memo, as he
would like to make sure that both Kelly and SoS are happy. Would you please be able to put this to
Kelly tonight and perhaps we could find 15 minutes tomorrow for them to discuss?

Best wishes,
Sophie
