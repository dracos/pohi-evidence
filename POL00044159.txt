Audit of Post Office® Fazakerley, Branch Code 214420.

On the 6" January 2012, accompanied by my colleague Richard Cross I conducted an
audit of the above named branch. Also present were Steve Bradshaw & Kevin Ryan

from the Security Team.

The purpose of this audit was to verify financial assets due to the Post Office®.

We arrived at the branch at 08.15 am and introduced ourselves to a member of staff
on the shop counter, she referred us to the Post Office counter were a member of
staff was sat in the dark behind the counter. I recognised this member of staff from a

previous visit.

We introduced ourselves and explained the reason for our visit and we were allowed

access to the secure area.

The other member of staff arrived at approximately 08:45 and I asked them to open
the safes so we could complete the audit.

I had contacted the Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) at approximately 08.30
am and advised that an audit would be performed at the branch, and that it would
remain closed until its conclusion. The nominated branches offered were: Longmoor
Lane and Walton Vale and a notice placed on display at the branch detailing this
information. I also asked the NBSC to notify the Outlet Intervention Office that an audit
was being performed and that the branch would remain closed until its conclusion.

The audit revealed a surplus in the branch of £559.07. A breakdown of the audit
result and details of the audit findings are as follows:

We conducted the audit as per the audit process manual.

At 15.30 I reported my preliminary figure for the audit to the Contract Advisor and
that I would email him the audit report, to confirm the final figure once I had
completed it; I was able to do this on the 8" January 2012 at 20.30 pm and reported
an overall surplus in the branch of £559 07 (as above). Some of this surplus could be
partly explained by £200 of ATM retracts that hadn't been enveloped and kept
separate as per ATM instructions.

After speaking on the telephone to the Sub Postmaster, Mr Asker (who was in
Sheffield) I advised him that I needed someone to take control of the keys from me; he
told me he would send a member of staff from one of his other branches (who I had
met at a previous audit) and I advised her to call the NBSC the next day to confirm
when the branch would be re-opening.

No Compliance Tests were carried out at this audit because there where no staff left
to test.

An extra report would not normally be produced after an audit that did not result ina
loss or gain over £1000. I wrote this report after a request from the Security Section

on 5" September 2012 and it is a true account of the audit.
