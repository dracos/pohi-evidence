Is stage, I am not asking for any action on it.

because she was involved in very difficult negotiations wi

the time, about the future commercial arrangements between the two businesses,

here almost as long as I have) are very pleased th
believe she is well Placed to lead the Post Office t!

We are, however, both very struck by the level of

The position is significantly worse now she is the CEO. Early indications suggest that
her salary is Toughly half the median salary of people who she would view as her
peers, as is her total remuneration package including her likely bonus and LTIP.

In the meantime, I simply want to draw this to your attention because I thought it
would be helpful for you to have advance warning of this issue and because it would
seem odd not to raise it at the point of our separation from Royal Mail.
