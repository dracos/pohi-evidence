The view beyond 2025:

Colleagues are asking for a refreshed
strategic direction and for it to
be communicated effectively.

The research suggests that
the strain experienced by
more senior Post Office
colleagues can be linked
to their exposure to p
and bureaucracy.

ics

Focusing on their experiences of
governance, and how their roles are
crafted may help reduce the strain
that they perceive they are under.

Poor communication is
driving a lack of confidence
in Post O1 -e and senior
management from our
colleagues.

This is directly impacting their sense
of pride and belief in Post Office.
This appears to be exacerbated
at present because Post Office's
communications are driven, and
controlled, by the external narrative.

Ata time when
communications are
critical, our colleagues have
highlighted that they don't
think we are getting it right.

This is unlikely to be helped by our
communications team being the least
engaged team within Post Office.

Colleagues with diverse
characteristics continue to
havea
experience of working at
Post Office.

This is particularly the case for
disabled colleagues, senior women
and senior ethnic minority colleagues
who want to progress.

This is an opportunity area given how intrinsic the role
of confidence is in the overall employee experience (see
page 7). However, there is a cohort of the population
‘who responded positively to each of the four key drivers
of confidence in senior leadership ~ 31% of S&T, 28%
of CFO and 26% of Technology colleagues ~ and the
opportunity is to deep-dive into these groups and
understand how confidence has formed and how they

Opportunities exist to improve the experience of
under-represented demographics, but this should be
balanced by many reasons to celebrate ED&l results.

Executive summary

1

Motivation remains high but colleagues
are less proud than ever before

* Three in four colleagues are motivated to
do the best job they can, but only one in
two feel proud to work at the Post Office,
25pts lower than 2022's annual survey.

* Analysis shows that rather than colleagues
becoming more neutral, the drop in pride is
due to a direct shift to negativity (+17pts, see
page 6). This indicates an emotive response,
likely due to external pressures, rather than
a sustained decline in sentiment over time.

decline in pride
since 2023

What you should consider

* Addressing concerns at senior levels — related
to strain, work-life balance and the culture
~is crucial to ensure these colleagues can
role-model and cascade positive experience
to maintain motivation and boost pride.

2

Improving Senior Leader confidence
is crucial to boost overall sentiment

* Confidence in Senior Leadership ~ a key
driver of pride, advocacy and belonging -
lags 34pts behind the UK norm at just 35%.
Analysis shows that leading by example,
communicating a motivating vision of the
future and communicating openly and
honestly are essential to confidence.

communications need to focus more on
building trust and confidence in Post Office

What you should consider

+ Encourage Senior Leadership to adopt a more
open, honest and authentic tone to help build
trust among colleagues and reinvigorate
life behind the 2025 strategic priorities.

Work-life balance area for focus,
particularly for Band 4 and SLP colleagues
# Overall, three in five colleagues feel able

to balance their work and personal life,

in line with 2022. However, this masks

a significant decrease among Band 4

and SLP colleagues (-14pts to 46%

and -18pts to 42% respectively).

These colleagues are more likely to experience
barriers relating to resources and a difficult
work environment than in 2022, reflecting their
experience of a bureaucratic, political

and inefficient culture (see page 17).

Engagement driven chiefly by culture factors, although
career development and enablement are also important

What you should know

* There are five key drivers of all four
aspects of engagement: consistent
business practice, ability to achieve career
objectives, demonstrating Ways of Working,
investing in people and work-life balance.

Each area of engagement also has
its own drivers, For example, to
increase pride, progress needs to be
made in building confidence in senior
leadership and improving processes
to support effective working

What you should consider

« Itis important that senior leaders set an.
example and exhibit Ways of Working
while clearly communicating the vision to
boost overall confidence (see page 13).

‘* Belief that opinions are valued is a key driver
of advocacy, belonging and motivation.
This relates to findings on page 16,
which reflect colleagues’ desire for more
‘two-way communication and evidence
that leaders are listening to them.

Culture varies significantly across grades

What you should know

* Those at PO/Admin level see a primarily
friendly, supportive culture defined by
continuous improvement, work-life balance,
respect and learning from mistakes.

‘* Among Middle Management and Band
3A, the experience is also friendly
and supportive, but political and
bureaucratic elements feature more
prominently than work-life balance,

‘* As seniority progresses to Band 4 and
SLP level, bureaucracy and politics
become defining features of the
culture, in addition to aversion to risk,
inefficiency and demoralisation

What you should consider

‘* These findings add weight to senior
colleagues’ consistently lower scores
and suggest a need for an ingrained
culture shift to address concerns.

‘+ Acting on this feedback is of utmost
importance to rebuild leader trust and
prevent negative culture perceptions
from cascading throughout Post Office.

for colleagues from an ethnic minority
