Attachment: HDR Defects Update Report 02.12.2022 v1.0.xIsx

Good Morning Paul and Lisa,

There are NO CBIF candidates to put forward this week and NO NEW DEFECTS to raise.

There is also THREE updates to the existing entries, that have been highlighted in yellow in the update column.
Changes to report and updates:

* The pivot has been updated

© The THREE updates are:
© 1has had the Status Update and Next Action to reflect lan Humphries progressing Ref Data request and
Fujitsu technical resources engaged for clarification around requirements
© Lhas had the Status Update and Next Action updated to reflect that Fujitsu technical resources have
commenced the design study.
© 1has had the Status Update and Next Action updated in line with lan Humphries (POL) advised the
reference data request has an eta of the end of week commencing 12/12.

* New Tab — Accepted Live Defects
oO We have been reviewing previous Live Defects that it has been agreed with POL do not need to be
fixed. This may be because the defective area is soon to be replaced by new functionality so a fix would be
of limited value e.g. issues with Help printing now we have the CWB coming along, or it may be that the
defect is something Post Office agree is acceptable e.g. the change of font when we implemented Azul
JRE on the counter. In the past we have closed these Peaks as requiring no further action. We believe we
should still show these as Live Defects but show them as Accepted so we have the most complete picture
at all times. We have reviewed past decisions and have created new Peaks and set them to the new status
in our system of Accepted Live Defect. We have identified 4 and you will see these on the fortnightly ALL
Live Defects report at the bottom with a status of “5 — Accepted Defect”, and also on a new tab on the
weekly HDR report. When the CWB is deployed, 2 of these will be closed which will leave us with 2. We
think this gives us both a more complete view of all Live Defects and also allows us, at a future date, to
consider whether we now wish to progress with a fix. If you think we have missed any then please let us
know and we can look into it and add them if required.

There is ONE OPEN ACTION for Fujitsu — as I have engaged technical resources and updated the HDR Extracts for the
below:

* PCO295854 LST: R70.40 Ctr - System Could Hang where Ingenico does not respond - PITPOS-112
© Status Update and Next Action reflects the latest position.

* PCO292825 Help Screen Freezing on the Counters in Branches
© Awaiting outcome of meeting scheduled 02/12/2022, so update can be provided to POL.
