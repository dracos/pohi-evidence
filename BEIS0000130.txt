POST OFFICE: MEETING WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS UNION -

3 SEPTEMBER

You are meeting Derek Hodgson (General Secretary) and Roger Darlington (Head of

Research) on Thursday.

The meeting is in part an initial discussion with you as Secretary of State, and in part a
continuation of the CWU’s dialogue with the Department on Post Office issues.

In addition, the meeting may also be a further element in the CWU’s broader lobbying

of Ministers about the Post Office Review: to our knowledge the CWU have in recent

weeks seen Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling (when Chief Secretary to the Treasury),
Donald Dewar, Ministers at the Welsh Office (as well as Geoffrey Norris at Number 10).
They have been pressing that there should be no sale of shares in the Post Office, and
that there should be no further conversions of Crown post offices. The CWU have also
recently written to all MPs about the Review.

The meeting likely to focus on the Review, and possibly the Horizon Automation

Project.

A brief is attached.

Officials are available to attend the meeting if you so desire.
