Mr Thomas was Postmaster at Gaerwen PO up until 13 October 2005 when his
Contract for Services was suspended.

I now have to write to Mr Thomas regarding a deficiency in the PO accounts
but do not have a forwarding address.

Would you kindly advise
the latest address that you have for Mr Thomas
please?

Kind Regards
