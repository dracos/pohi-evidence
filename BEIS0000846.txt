You’re not overreacting. I agree.

Hi All

I have several problems with this. The principle one is its failure to identify which of those
involved in cognate roles pre HSS were involved in any Horizon cases, regardless of whether any
wrongdoing is alleged (a foolish and self serving way of looking at the problem in my view, happy
to explain why i think that if useful).

This to me shows a failure to get a proper grip and suggests a lack of appropriate openness.

Am I overreacting?

All best

Trusting you are well.

I am coming back to you as advised below, following the Post Office Board of 8th July where the matter
of ‘Past Roles’ was discussed. My apologies about the delay in reverting with a further update.

There are currently 73 employees working within Post Office's Remediation Unit (RU) who were also
employed by Post Office during the period currently being considered by the Inquiry. The majority of
those employed during this period were in unrelated roles, for example they were branch counter
employees. A minority were employed in related roles, such as branch auditors and trainers - Post
Office required employees with these skill sets in RU because they had the skills, experience, and
knowledge necessary to stand up and run the schemes. Their knowledge of legacy internal processes
and systems were critical and remain important to the delivery of Redress.

Whilst these individuals were employed during the relevant period, there has been no suggestion that
they have committed any wrongdoing. Critically none of these employees have ever had any role in
decision making on redress outcomes. They predominantly undertake technical data gathering exercises
or fulfil administrative functions. As you know, Post Office have the independent external panel review
for redress in the Horizon Shortfall Scheme and disputed issues on Overturned Convictions cases, which
adds further independent oversight over these processes.

Notwithstanding that position, Post Office are alive to the perception this creates externally. Post Office
has undertaken a full review of this issue in consideration of reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of
this, whilst balancing the need to be fair and follow due process in relation to Post Office employees and
Post Office’s employment obligations. Following this review, actions, agreed by Board on 8th July will be
implemented. We can provide further detail after the 24th of September Board noting these actions will
first need to be communicated to any potentially impacted individuals.

Separate to the exercise described above, where it is alleged that any employee was guilty of
misconduct relating to the work they performed previously, Post Office will investigate those allegations.
If the allegations are proven following an investigation, Post Office will take appropriate disciplinary
action.

Thanks for the update.

We have two concerns: one is about supporting trust of the victims in the compensation arrangements
(and anything else relevant) but the other is about timing, given the extensive ongoing bad publicity
emanating from the Inquiry at the same time as the ongoing and imminent new compensation
arrangements. So anything you can deliver on the reassurance issue around the involvement of
individuals, but also swiftly, would be useful.

Thanks, and best wishes,
Chris

We held an HCAB meeting yesterday, at least semi-informally, and no minutes will be published until a
new Government is in place. It is interesting that there are so many issues continuing to require
attention.

We noted your letter, for which we were grateful. Thank you for your kind offer to brief us further: we
didn’t feel it necessary yesterday, not least in the light of electoral purdah. But we would be grateful for
a further update. We note your ongoing review. The view was expressed that one might expect the
answer in relation to individuals (about previous involvement and hence ongoing involvement on sub-
postmaster and mistress matters) to be either yes or no, so we’re intrigued to know more about the
substance of the review, and its timing.

Thanks and regards,
Chris
