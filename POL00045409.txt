Statement?

there were four others produced prior to the auditors arriving. So were you

you'd been asked to return money but the money wasn't there? Is that correct?

JH No comment.

GB Asks if there's any possibility of adding to the prepared statement, details of the

staff that work in the Post Office? States that he may have to obtain denial
