Subject: POL - One More Item

Duncan / Wendy

Apologies - One further item — POL may comment (or even thank) Fujitsu for ongoing support of Project Sparrow (ref
name to the High Court Case re Sub Postmasters and the Horizon application).

We continue to provide strong and timely support to POL and their legal team with documentation and technical
explanation.

For info, we have received a request this week that all documents and communication to POL be disclosed. We are
working through Chris Jay (FJ legal) and POL on how we respond.

Thanks and regards

Nigel.
