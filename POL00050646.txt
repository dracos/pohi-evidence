Continuation of statement of Elaine Ridge

Subpostrasters usually locate the actual Post Office in premises in which they also run a
private business. Under the terms of the contract, Subpostmasters have sole responsibility for
all stock and cash, and for all daily, weekly and monthly accounting and administration in
respect of the Post Office.

Mrs Misra’s general duties included the following:

Sale of postage stamps, postal orders, National Savings products, travel products, financial
services products e.g. cat/home insurance, personal loans etc, Homephone service, in addition

to banking and bill payment transactions.

Post Office Ltd within it’s main Branch Post Offices and Sub Post Offices uses a computerised
accounting system known as HORIZON in relation to the various types of transactions
conducted over the counter and for the recording of daily, weekly and monthly figures in
relation to those transactions. The system is used by the operator to conduct all transactions
carried out at the counter and therefore the operator is able to view the extent of transactions
conducted on a daily, weekly and monthly basis as well as provide information as to the state

of stock sold or received and cash received.

A Post Office Operations Manual is held at each Post Office outlet operating the Horizon
system.

Post Office Ltd operates a system whereby all offices must bring to account all of the
transactions conducted over a period of a month as well as declare the correct amount of cash
and stock held at the close of business which ultimately leads to the office ‘Balance’. This term
is used throughout the Post Office when referring to the monthly practice of declaring the
state of the office accounts.

Continuation of statement of Elaine Ridge

The accounting month for a Post Office would start with the actual cash and stock physically
held on site known and this formed part of the starting figure used for accounting purposes for
that month. As the month progresses a large number of transactions are performed over the
counter with the general public, for instance if a customer purchases a first class stamp for 36
pence, the Post Office counter provides the customer with a first class stamp (Le. stock) and
therefore the starting figure reduces by 36 pence in the stock portion, however, the customer
hands the Post Office 36 pence in cash, this therefore inflates the cash figure by 36 pence and
brings the starting figure back to it’s original state and a ‘balance’ is once again established.

The Horizon system keeps a running tally of all transactions conducted over the course of the
month and the operator is able to request various reports from the system at any time to
display the current state of the accounts, such as the cash on hand figure etc. These can be

viewed on the monitor or printed off.

A balance is reached when the figures for both the payments and receipts are the same, any
discrepancy in the two figures would result in the office declaring a shortage or a surplus of
cash in the accounts. Once the operator is content with the office accounts, they are then
required to print off two copies of the Branch Trading Account, these accounts show
summaries of all transactions conducted that month together with the actual values of cash
and stock to hand. Both copies of the Branch Trading Account must be signed by the Sub
Postmaster as being a true record of the state of accounts of the office, both the trial and final

copies are retained at the branch.

Sometime during Monday 14" January 2008 I received a telephone call from Keith Noverre,
Post Office Ltd Auditor. He told me that there was going to be a substantial audit shortage at
West Byfleet Post Office. As a result of this information I then spoke to Mrs Seema Misra the
subpostmistress and precautionary suspended her.

Continuation of statement of Elaine Ridge

Under the terms of the subpostmaster contract, a subpostmaster is prohibited from using Post
Office® cash for their own purposes. Subpostmaster Contract, section 12, paragraph 3 states
the following:

‘The subpostmaster is expressly forbidden to make use of the balance due to Post Office Ltd
for any purpose other than the requirements of the Post Office service; and he must, on no
account apply to his own private use, for however short a period, any portion of Post Office Ltd
funds entrusted to him/her. They must also be careful to keep the Post Office® money
separate from any other monies. Misuse of Post Office Ltd cash may render the offender liable
to prosecution and, or, the termination of his Contract of Appointment’

I produce as exhibit ER/01 the contract which Mrs Misra signed agreeing to be bound by the
terms of her contract and by the rules contained in the book of rules and the instructions
contained in those postal instructions issued to her. In addition I also produce as exhibit ER/02
the appropriate page from the Subpostmasters Contract which details the subpostmasters
responsibilities for Post Office stock and cash.

I can confirm from Post Office Training records that Mrs Misra received the following training;
Two weeks in a class room environment and then a trainer attend the branch for one week on

site training which is, the standard training given to any Postmaster.
