Hi Sree

Hope all is well, has there been any progress with the issues I raised?

The dual log in’s and process of the new payments, I was under the impression you were going to get
back to me.

I mentioned the issues to you in detail on the 18.2.22 by phone, happy to go through them again if
needed.

Saf. Apologies for not responding earlier in a promptly manner; I am somewhat buried in a number of parallel
technical programmes of activity.

I have asked Sree (Balanchandra) to lead the exploration of all available options relating to dual Horizon logon. Sree is
working with the POL Compliance and Network Operations teams to understand which avenues are open to us. He
will revert when he has followed up with the necessary individuals in POL. I’d expect that to happen in the next week.

I have also asked Sree to chase up on the PCI-DSS question that you raised. I rather suspect that the new PCI-DSS
compliance requirements dictated the revised journey steps mean because we (POL) have limited access to the BIN
ranges that are encoded in the PAN data. In the previous non- compliant journey, Horizon had full access to the full
PAN data on the card (16 digits) and held reference data about the card capabilities (whether it is deposit only, ATM
etc). With the new compliant PCI solution the Horizon system has restricted access, called BIN 6 - i.e. the first 4 PAN
digits and 2 others in the PAN 16 char string. This means that the issuing bank holds the precise card features and
these are securely released to POL when the card is inserted an a valid PIN is provided. Overall these changes are
what allow us to achieve PCIDSS compliance. I will ask Sree to get one of our technical specialists to join on us ona call
to explain this in depth.

Finally, I have asked Zdravko to loop back on the BranchHub login question that you raised with me and he has agreed
to do so.

Would it be useful to have a catch up this afternoon — I am free today from 17:00 onwards or could do anytime

between 13:00 and 15:00 tomorrow (Friday) if either works for you.

Best regards
Jeff

Saf — Very happy to do that. I’m in a GE session for a few hours this morning.
Today, I’m free 1300-1400, 1430-15:00 or 15:30-16:00 or 18:00-1830 if any of those slots work for you.

Probably also worth saying up front that the Horizon policies around dual login for users are set by network and
compliance teams - and then implemented by IT.

Lets work through what the issues so I can understand it better.

Thanks

Jeff
