Thanks Sophie — it seems like a good plan to me, though just be aware that many of the recipients of this email are
tied up in a Sparrow meeting all day! Cheers Chris

My view of this is that, if we are to respond we should simply refer to what we have said previously, and is referenced
in the Scheme documentation in that details of the cases will be kept confidential. Also, the meeting note between
Paula, Alice and JA says:

JA questioned whether this report could not be published earlier and suggested that Second Sight could produce a

report for the end of February. PV explained that that would not be possible and that Second Sigh

matters internal while the mediation I was ongoing but that ‘there could bea report at the end
“ re

This note was signed off by JA’s office. What I am not sure about is the extent to which we want to say that it would
be disappointing if he were to make the point about it is possible, but he has not been told so, that PO don’t want to
say anything about individual cases until something can be said about all of them, as he agreed at the meeting with
Paula and Alice that a running commentary would be unhelpful and it has always been the case that individual cases
will remain confidential. The Scheme documentation makes that point.

Mark, do you have a view, and was there anything we can refer back to from the meeting of MPs —I wasn’t there.
Sophie/Mel, are you drafting the response?
We need to comment today and I have WG all day.

Best wishes
