1. Scoring Table

Below table sets out the Residual Risk Score and Rating that will apply upon review of the
Postmaster Complaints Handling Policy, to determine how effective the policy is, any control
weaknesses or gaps and whether the policy needs enhancements/improvements.

The framework of governance, risk management and control is adequate and effective.

Some improvements are required to enhance the adequacy and effectiveness of the
framework of governance, risk management and control.

There are significant weaknesses in the framework of governance, risk management and
control such that it could be or could become inadequate and ineffective.

There are fundamental weaknesses in the framework of governance, risk management
and control such that it is inadequate and ineffective or is likely to fail.

2. Overall Rating / Residual Risk Score of The Review

There are significant weaknesses in the framework of governance, risk management and
control such that it could be or could become inadequate and ineffective.

The overall rating for this policy is that it needs significant improvement to make it satisfactory. This
rating has predominantly been based on the lack of direct evidence to support the various risk areas
but there are specific issues that need to be addressed:

1. The risks are not articulated well and appear to be more of an impact rather than risk
which means it is challenging to set out the controls properly.

2. Most of the controls are in fact processes rather than an action which makes it difficult to
measure their effectiveness

3. There is no SLA set in the policy yet there is an expectation that complaint service levels
will be reviewed

4. Whist a number of metrics are tracked, it is not clear whether service level data is tracked
in accordance with the policy or if recurring themes/issues/root causes are identified.

What worked well:

1. Complaint handling times appear to be OK. According to the dashboard 92% of complaints
were resolved within SLA*

2. The reporting dashboard appears to track the majority of the required metrics

3. Training in the policy is good with all staff trained in it (together with the Speak Up!
training) and all have refresher training timetabled

1-The SLA is stated to be 10 days on the dashboard but this is not reflected in the policy

Other Findings of The Review

It is concerning that key individuals with roles & responsibilities set out in the policy are
unaware of each other. This needs to be addressed

Overview

The purpose of the Policy Monitoring Report is to understand, test and gain assurance based
on some point of control assurance that the Postmaster Complaints Handling Policy is
working and fit for purpose.

Objective of the review

To assess the validity of the policy within the universe of risk framework. To review the lead
and lag indicators of the policy and to test some of the key minimum control standards in
the Postmaster Complaints Handling Policy. Finally, to assess whether the effectiveness of
the policy is being implemented across the group.

Background

The Postmaster Complaints Handling Policy is sponsored by the Group Chief Retail Officer
and owned by the Retail Engagement Director, however day-to-day implementation of the
policy is the responsibility of the Issue Resolution Manager. The purpose of the policy is to
set out the minimum control standards to be met in order to manage complaints from
Postmasters consistently, fairly and within agreed timescales.

The policy sits within a suite of postmaster support policies that have been established with
the intention to set the minimum operating standards relating to the management of our
postmaster contract risks throughout the business. The suite of policies purport to be in-line
with Post Office’s risk appetite, which is primarily averse.

The Postmaster Complaints Handling Policy was initially drafted, reviewed and approved by
the ARC in March 2021 with the current version being approved by the ARC in December
2022. This review forms part of the policy assurance review programme.

Methodology

The approach to the review was as follows:

Is risk adequately identified?

Is the risk appetite correctly identified?

Are the key personnel correctly identified?

Are reported minimum controls actually controls?

What are the key controls?

What are the key metrics?

Is the process/procedure correctly articulated?

Does the evidence show the policy is working?

Given the above, can we be sure the policy is fit for purpose?

8. Source of Information

The review was based on information collected from interviews with key roles supported by
information provided as a result of the meetings. Access was provided to both Dynamics
and the complaints’ dashboard (via PowerBl). Evidence was sought from both the Issue
Resolution Team Manager and Retail Engagement Director but was provided too late to test
as to the effectiveness of the roles and controls set out in the policy that the evidence
referred to.

What are the key controls? As controls have not been described

these would work. Rewording the

controls may help but only where risk

areas are improved. A specific control

states that common and recurring issues

will be escalated to the Voice of the

Postmaster meeting, however these

meetings have been suspended with no

replacement indicated.

What are the key metrics? The key metrics are:

Number of Complaints received over

* Complaints via channel

* Service Level data against target —

* Resolution types

* General themes of Complaint types

* Identification of recurring themes and

10. Recommendations

The following recommendations are made

1. The controls must be revisited and changed from being procedural steps to actual
controls

2. Regular meetings between Speak Up! and the Issue Resolution Manager need to be
put in place to ensure the relevant risk is managed properly

3. The business needs to review the dashboard and determine whether it is fit for
purpose and document the decision

4. The Voice of Postmaster meetings must be reinstated and communications with
Postmasters improved so that thematic issues can be addressed properly
