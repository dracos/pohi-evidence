Pat,

I raised the point about not keeping both copies of the Audit Data on a single site, regardless of the 'separation' between
the Data Centres. This was based on current POL attitudes where Graham and I have just fought a 2 year battle with
them over the loss of a single days data due to co-incidental and concurrent DLT failures at Wigan and Bootle. The cost
to Pathway for settling ‘out of court' was £150,000.

Given that POL have just forced us to retain audit data for 15 years under Schedule N01, and using the £150k/day figure
that they have now established, and assuming that they would adopt a similar approach to future losses, you can see why
we can't take the risk - it works out to something like £55m per year cumulative.

Of course they might just turn around and say they will take that risk in which case it's our call as to whether we believe
them or not.

I believe that there is a similar remote argument for a copy of the TMS layer since this too is not recoverable in the event
of total loss.

Regards,

Jan

This was the subject of significant discussion last Thursday.

The audit issue will require the provision of an off-site repository for data which can then be used to populate the
failover datacentre.

Security issues are likely in the main to comprise physical security arrangements and integrity. We have extensive
obligations/commitments under the current contract but I believe this is all up for negotiation depending upon the
offering. This should be considered as part of Tony Drahota's review of security and threats

Jan / Graham,

If we move the current datacentres into one building, allbeit with separate fire zones and power supplies,
do you have any issues around security / audit that need to be considered?

Graham,

Do we have any commitment regarding security of the datacentres and sharing with other peoples kit etc
etc?

Help
