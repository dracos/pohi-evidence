 Gerald,
 Can you confirm that we are talking about as far back as Sept 2009 ?

 Are you able to pop down and explain and show us what we are to look for, as we will need to put together some time
 scales to complete this task.

 Thanks

 Hi,

           A serious flaw has recently been spotted in the audit code. It was introduced in the fix to PCO187097 quite
 some time ago (but post HNGx). There is a small possibility of missing transactions on generated spreadsheets if the
 query handling was run during the evening Query Manager shutdown. Please raise an A priority PEAK on this issue
 and send it to Audit-Dev. In the meantime for any ARQ run which results in transaction spreadsheets examine the
 QueryHandler.log in its ARQ folder and check for the line "Shutdown Signalled - Process terminating" and if it occurs
 rerun the query. You may consider it necessary to check previous ARQs run. If you do you can check the RFI close log
 for the line "Shutdown Signalled - Process terminating" and if it occurs rerun the query as a precaution. I believe you
 keep copies of the close logs but if you do not they are always themselves archived on the audit system and can be
