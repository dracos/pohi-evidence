Gerald,
Can you confirm that we are talking about as far back as Sept 2009 ?

Are you able to pop down and explain and show us what we are to look for, as we will need to put together some time
scales to complete this task.

Thanks

Subject: Possibility of missing transactions

Hi,

A serious flaw has recently been spotted in the audit code. It was introduced in the fix to PC0187097 quite
some time ago (but post HNGx). There is a small possibility of missing transactions on generated spreadsheets if the
query handling was run during the evening Query Manager shutdown. Please raise an A priority PEAK on this issue
and send it to Audit-Dev. In the meantime for any ARQ run which results in transaction spreadsheets examine the
QueryHandler.log in its ARQ folder and check for the line “Shutdown Signalled - Process terminating” and if it occurs
rerun the query. You may consider it necessary to check previous ARQs run. If you do you can check the RFI close log
for the line “Shutdown Signalled - Process terminating” and if it occurs rerun the query as a precaution. | believe you
keep copies of the close logs but if you do not they are always themselves archived on the audit system and can be
retrieved.

Regards,
Gerald Barnes
