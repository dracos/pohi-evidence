This now supported by press release just sent - this means working group has collapsed.
Suggest we today need to:

- write to Tony Hooper saying scheme no longer works in face of this breach

- ditto JFSA

- get a Board call

- advise BIS

- prepare lines

Subject: Fw: ONE show

Just FYI - they ran the One Show piece tonight, one day earlier than they told us. Maybe this was
riven by events, but I would think it suits us to get it all out in one go

Attention now seems to have turned to what might happen in Westminster...
