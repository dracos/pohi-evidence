SUMMARY OF WORK:

As part of the ongoing maintenance of the Hardware equipment held within all 11,365 (as at
15/08/11) Branches, Fujitsu is to carry out Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) on the equipment
held within each Branch. The PAT is included within the price of the current contract and needs
to be carried out within the financial year 2011/12 (Project scheduled to complete in March
2012).

Description of Change Proposed:

As part of the ongoing maintenance of the Hardware equipment held within all 11,365 (as at
15/08/11) Branches, Fujitsu is to carry out Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) on the equipment
held within each Branch. The PAT is included within the scope and price of the current contract
and needs to be carried out by 31‘ March 2012.

The proposed testing of in scope equipment (see list below) is scheduled to be completed
between August 2011 and March 2012. There will be a mid roll out break in November and
December 2011 to coincide with Post Office Ltd’s peak trading period.

The following items of kit within the branch are within scope and require Portable Appliance
Testing and will be tested by EAW Energy Ltd:-

Base Unit

Base Unit IEC Lead
Base Unit Y Cable (left)
Base Unit Y Cable (right)
Pin Pad PSU

CTX PSU

Epson Printer

Oki Printer

The PAT requirement is restricted to the items listed above, and does not take into account
performing PAT on any AEI equipment, Kiosks, Note Dispensers, Scales, Branch Routers or
any other item that is connected to the Horizon sockets within a branch. The Branch Router is
to be excluded due to the impact on the ability of a Branch to trade and the increased risk that
will result from taking a Branch Router down at the Branch whilst the cable is tested. In
addition the Branch Router is considered to be a new item within the estate hence is not
included within the testing this time round.

These visits will be scheduled by EAW Energy Ltd and take place between the hours of 08:00 -
18:00 Monday to Friday, whilst retaining the option to extend to Saturday visits where it is
mutually beneficial to both EAW Energy Ltd and to the Branch involved.

Visits will be scheduled by EAW Energy Ltd with the Branch directly, and a suitable date and
time will be agreed between the two parties with branches being given reasonable notice of a
proposed date. Where an agreed time and date can not be reached, details of the Branch
involved will be logged and escalated by EAW Energy Ltd to Fujitsu and subsequently to Post
Office Ltd in order that suitable arrangements can be made with the Branch to allow access.

A process has been put in place with Post Office Ltd so that Fujitsu can escalate details of these
Branches and Post Office Ltd will arrange a suitable date and time on behalf of Fujitsu and
EAW Energy Ltd with these Branches.

When more than 24hrs notice is given by a Branch for any cancellation of a planned visit to
that Branch by EAW Energy Ltd then no excess charges will apply. In the event that a Branch
does not allowing access at the agreed time or cancels providing less than 24hrs notice then
Fujitsu will charges the Post Office Limited £54.37 for a revisit.. Due to the anticipated
relatively low numbers of these they will be grouped together and charged to Post Office Ltd
via the CT process at project completion. In addition, where additional costs are incurred for
travel by boat/plane to a Highland or Island, then these additional costs will also be passed on
to Post Office Ltd if access is denied or less than 24hrs notice of cancellation is provided
resulting in the engineer being required to make a return journey to the Branch concerned. If
there are multiple cancellations/refusals at the same Branch, then each of these will be charged
accordingly to Post Office Ltd should the cancellation period be breached. Fujitsu will use
reasonable endeavours to mitigate such occurrences.

Ifan item fails the PAT, then EAW Energy Ltd will replace plugs, fuses and IEC leads in order
to restore service to the counter. They will also replace both CTX and Pin Pad PSU’s should
they fail the PAT.

If a base unit or printer fails the test then a call will be logged with the Horizon Service Desk
(ASD) and it will receive the appropriate service level for that reported instance. For example,
a 3hr response for any branch that is unable to trade, and Next Business Day for any counter
affecting problems.

At the point that the engineer discovers that either the base unit or printer have failed the test,
that counter position will be deemed to have failed the PAT and will not be able to be used until
an engineer has been to site and replaced the item(s). Where an engineer attends a Branch to
replace a failed item, the counter can then be used once the engineer hardware exchange has

been completed. A revisit to the Branch to test the newly installed item will not be carried out as
the kit is sent out from repair in a safe manner.

All engineers working on this project will have undertaken the security clearance process and be
certified by Post Office Ltd as being suitable to attend a Branch and be allowed access to the
equipment. For all visits, a PAT Testing Record Sheet will be completed and consolidated
within 10 working days by EAW Energy Ltd and provided to Fujitsu.

Reporting will be provided to Post Office Ltd on a weekly basis by Fujitsu via a report that
contains the following items:-
+ Jobs scheduled for the previous week (Branches + Counters)
Jobs signed off as complete from the previous week (Branches + Counters)
Non completions for previous week, with breakdown of reasons (Point Of Failure)
Replaced items in previous week (by part)
Total Jobs scheduled to date
Total Jobs completed to date
Non completions to date, with breakdown of reasons - where the failure was due to a
branch not allowing access or the equipment not being available within 20 minutes, the
scheduled time of arrival plus the actual time of arrival will be included.
Replaced hardware to date
Tracker to show progress against latest schedule

There is a requirement as outlined in the schedule of work between Fujitsu and EAW Energy
Ltd, for the Branch to have equipment available within 20 minutes of EAW Energy Ltd
attending site and identifying themselves to the Branch. If an engineer is not able to get access
within this timeframe or unable to get to the equipment because of other items preventing him
from obtaining access then an aborted visit may occur, and additional charges of £54.37 will be
charged to Post Office Ltd for a revisit. The calculation of charges for such incidents are to be
agreed by all parties, EAW Energy Ltd, Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu will use
reasonable endeavours to mitigate such incidents. . Additional charges for travel and/or hotels
required for a subsequent revisit will also be charged to Post Office Ltd.

As part of the process Fujitsu will carry out User Satisfaction interviews with Branches using
the Horizon Service Desk on a daily basis and make the aggregated findings available to Post

Office Ltd on a monthly basis. Fujitsu will use reasonable endeavours to obtain feedback from
10% of all Branches attended during the lifespan of the PAT project.

Where a counter is inaccessible due to the Branch layout, this will be escalated to Post Office
Ltd who will have the full responsibility to work with the Branch concerned to correct the
access and allow for an engineer to re-attend and successfully carry out the work required.
Where a counter is deemed as being unreachable to test, it will be deemed to have failed the
PAT and as such, should not be used again until such point that testing has been able to have
taken place.

EAW Energy Ltd have a list of prioritised Branches as defined by Post Office Ltd, and will use
reasonable endeavours to ensure that these Branches are given time slots that allow for work on
key counters (AEI and hub) to take place before the Branches open to the public - primarily pre
09:00. Should any requirement for additional Branches to be prioritised, then Post Office Ltd
can make the request to Fujitsu, who will on a reasonable endeavours basis try and arrange
