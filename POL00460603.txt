GROUP ASSURANCE - TOM
This is a new proposal combining all Assurance functions,

expectation is that all second line roles will be

multiskilled and able to carry out compliance/assurance/oversee risk activities across the business in an

the other Heads of including Head or Risks & Controls, the saving could be ased to ensure more feet on the ground?

Me should also consider having just one platform for risks and controle ~ not a separate one for change progrannes.

+ The Compliance Ops manager [¢ team of 1 but may not be needed) could ait under the Head of Compliance ~ Reg & Corporate functions, this would reduce
the Line management burden of the GAD and give the “Head of" role the ownership of reporting ~ including dashboards ete.

I changed the Head of Risk to Risk & Controls - the roles sitting under this should be specialists - but with improved ways of managing risks and

oversight of controls ~ implenenting the control franework working with all the Heads of.

This would require a ToM review within current set up and within first Line function to enoure clear separation between first and second Line

+ Tuternal Audit would be separated under a Chinese wall, but under GAD to ensure integration and alignnent.

*The previous slide is a revised version of the
original ToM proposal for LCAS presented in
October 2023. The previous slide looks across all
Assurance activities and is a starter for ten.

*The Oct version was inward looking into LCAS only
and are captured in slides 4 to 9. Slide 10
looked at incorporating Risk only.

* This version was formally shared with Finance and the
People Team, but was never progressed.

Based on a detailed bottom-up analysis of cluster op split (FTE) ‘Total

the activities undertaken within Group
Compliance, the following are some key
observations:

* only 27 % of the FTE's are involved in
true second line activities
* That said, as POL is aware this is
skewed to certain functions only (See
Table 2)

Majority of the team, c 43%, perform
functional (first line (1.5)) activities
which fall under categories such

as continuous monitoring, investigating
etc.

Group Compliance TOM Assumptions #11

+ This analysis is myopic to Group Compliance ie has not considered any synergies or overlaps
across wider POL second line functions (see slide Xx)

+ PA - Is a team resource

+ MERO - Stays within Compliance, under core assumption that job specs for wider team include
Fin Crime, ABC coverage, and matrix managed.

+ IR/DP - Are first line roles moving into Group Legal.
Functional Compliance/Assurance Leads ~ Network of Assurance will need to be created across

first line (per ARC Integrated Assurance Sign off)

+ Group Compliance ~ All roles would need revised job specs as change is greater than 30% and
approach is very different ie floating resource.

* Group Compliance - Roles transitioning to First line would not need a revaluation in the
short rum (see next slide)
