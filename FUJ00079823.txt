Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 25/10/00

1 Introduction

This document describes the ICL Pathway Development Directorate Incident/Defect
Management process. It supersedes and replaces PA/PRO/014 (Pathway PinICL
Problem Management Procedure).

The process has been decomposed and the following Sub Processes identified:
e Incident capture
© Quality Filter Process
o Incident Analysis
o Change Management Actions
co Solution Components
¢ Incident Closure
¢ Target Release Assignment
¢ Defect Resolution
¢ Defect Test and Closure
The document has been organised in three sections:

Section 2.0 describes an end-to-end view of the process and illustrates the
major owners of Incidents raised.

Section 3.0 describes a summary of the Incident/Defect Management Process,
identifying; sub processes, process flows, inputs and outputs.

Section 4.0 describes each sub-process identifying; process flows, inputs and
outputs

A process flow diagram and a process flow description have been produced for each
component using a standard format.

2 Scope

The process recognises two major threads of ownership for Incidents raised:

e Customer Service for Incidents generated from the live service and
associated activities e.g. Live Calls, Reference Data Team, OSD and
Operational Test Team.

e¢ Development for Incidents generated by: Business and Technical
Conformance during planned testing activities; and likewise for
Delivery Units during planned testing activities.

¢ Defect Resolution.

As illustrated above.

For completeness and to facilitate understanding of the end-to-end nature of the
process all components have been described. However, many of the components will
be complemented by local work instructions or replaced by other processes such as
with the Customer Service Incident Management for Incident Capture.(CS/PRD/074).

It should also be noted that Customer Service has their own processes covering:
Incident Capture; Incident Closure; Release Management Forum; and Defect Test and

Closure.

The process flow diagrams also include steps required to update information in
PinICL, which is the ICL Pathway tool for Incident/Defect Management. Principally it
is the Response Codes and ensuring that the correct Product and Product Group are

selected that are referenced.

FUJ00079823

Process Rationale:

The process is built on the fundamental that only the Call
Logger of the Incident or a member of the same team is
permitted to close.

Incident Closure and Defect Test and Closure are the Sub
Processes that verify if the documented conclusions have
satisfied the Incident as stated.

Incidents originating from the live service are managed in
cooperation with Customer Service with the Release
Management Forum authorising any change to Target Release.

A comprehensive record is maintained through out the life of
the Incident/Defect and all decisions catalogued. The PinICL
system provides the mechanism for achieving this audit log

Inputs/Triggers:

Formal test stage.
Live system use.

Live system operation.
Observation.

The trigger is the observation of a difference between expected
and actual behaviour of a Product or Service.

Sub Processes:

1.0 Incident capture.

2.0 Quality Filter Process.
2.1 Incident Analysis.
2.2 Change Management Actions.
2.3 Solution Components.

3.0 Incident Closure.

4.0 Target Release Assignment.

5.0 Defect Resolution.

6.0 Defect Test and Closure.

Resources:

Potentially all Pathway Programme Staff, but mainly:
Delivery Unit Managers.

CS staff responsible for operation and support.
B&TC and CS Managers responsible for Test stages.

B&TC and CS Managers responsible for releasing product to
the live estate.

Programme and Directorate Management Teams.

Outputs:

Closed Incidents

Closed Defects.

Incident/Defect Management
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 25/10/00
Process Rationale: I Any member of Pathway’s staff can originate an Incident.
The Incident needs to be supported by evidence and a
description of the circumstances under which it was observed.
Local Management needs to approve the Incident prior to
passing it on to the Quality Filter Process for analysis.
Vast majority of Incidents captured originate from scripted
testing or from the live service.
Live service Incidents arrive with the target release set at the
current release.
All other Incidents have the target release set to unknown but
the text should be updated to include a recommendation for
release.
Inputs/Triggers: Formal Test Stage.

Live Service.
Live Service Support
Observation.

The trigger is the formal description of the Incident and
associated evidence.

Sub Processes:

Incident/Defect Management
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 25/10/00

Process Rationale: I The process is operated under the control of the Incident/Defect
Manager.

QFP Representatives are identified for each of the Delivery
Units.

QFP Administration maintains a list of these representatives.

QFP Administration assigns Incidents to the QFP
Representatives for analysis.

The QFP Representatives are responsible for ensuring that either
the Incident is recommended for closure or a potential product
defect is identified.

If the Incident has been incorrectly assigned it is returned with a
recommendation as to where it should go.

As Incidents are routed for analysis onto the QFP Stack the QFP
Representatives are expected to identify Incidents relevant to
their own product areas and not wait until the Incident is
assigned by QFP administration.

This is a fast moving process and the emphasis is on
appropriateness, consequently the steps indicated in the Process
and Sub Processes can and do happen in a different order to that
shown.

The QFPF also can happen at different times during the process
and if required Incidents are reviewed more than once.

Inputs/Triggers: Approved Incidents.
Incidents returned after further review with Call Logger.

Incidents returned after defect consideration.

Sub Processes: 2.1 Incident Analysis.
2.2 Change Management.
2.3 Solution Components.

Resources: QFP Representatives.
Incident/Defect Management.

Pathway Managers responsible for testing.

Outputs: Incidents returned to Call Logger for either closure or further
action.

Suspected build Incident.

Target Release Assignment.

Standards: PinICL Training Manual and PinICL Reference Data Guide.

Incident/Defect Management
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 25/10/00
Process Rationale: I Initial investigation is undertaken.
If the QFP Representative believes this Incident or this Incident
plus others reveals a design weakness then it can be escalated to
the TDA as a Problem and progressed in accordance with the
ICL Pathway Development Directorate Problem Management
Process, PA/PRO/016.
The priority of the call has to be agreed and any discussions
undertaken with the Call Logger if the priority needs to be
changed.
Suspected build Incidents are sent to TI.
The Incident can be updated and returned to the Call Logger for
a variety of reasons e.g.:
No fault in product.
User error.
Duplicate call.
Insufficient Evidence.
The Incident can be updated and routed to the TDA if baseline
documents are impacted for review under the Change
Management Sub Process.
The Incident can be updated and routed for further detailed
review by the Delivery Unit and identification of solution
components.
A QFPF review is required if the Target Release has not been
set or is inappropriate.
Inputs/Triggers: Approved Incidents.
Incidents returned by Call Logger.
Incidents returned after defect consideration.
Incidents returned from TDA Problem Management Process.
Incidents returned from Change Management for further

Process Rationale: I The QFP Representative ensures that all solution components
are identified and can be progressed satisfactorily. If
appropriate, a workaround solution may be required for the
current baseline as well as a longer-term solution or
consequential work may be required in another Delivery Unit,
which has to be worked on in parallel.
Copy (Clone) PinICLs should be used for this task with a
separate PinICL raised for each piece of work. The PinICL
should be updated with a clear set of instructions so that the
relationships are clear. The procedure for raising clone PinICLs
is covered in the PinICL Reference Data Guide CM/MAN/005.
Discussion with CS if a KEL entry is required or needs to be
updated. The Procedure for updating/creating KELs is contained.
in the PinICL Reference Data Guide CM/MAN/005.
A QFPF review is required if the Target Release has not been
set or is inappropriate.
For calls where a live fix impact has been requested an Impact
statement is produced and sent to the RMF for Target Release
consideration.

Inputs/Triggers: Incident — Initial analysis completed.
Target Release assigned by QFPF/RMF.

Sub Processes: None.

Resources: QFP Representative.
Problem Management.

Outputs: Incidents - all solution components.

The QFPF will comprise:
Delivery Unit QFP Representatives.
Release Managers.
Test Managers.
TDA Representative.
SSC Representative.
TI Representative.

Incident/Defect Management are represented at the weekly CS Release
Management Forum where Target Releases for designated calls originating
from the live service are determined.

QFPF review the Incidents and an appropriate Target Release identified. If a
live fix is being recommended the Incident is updated requesting that a live
fix impact is to be provided to the RMF for consideration.

The Target Release consideration also takes on board any KPR impact. The
KPR is produced by B&TC and indicates any Incidents outstanding from
formal testing visible to the client. Each Incident on the KPR has an agreed
Target Release with the Client. The KPR procedure is owned by B&TC and
is identified in DE/PRO/003.

The QFPF also provides an opportunity to arrange KEL entries with the
SSC representative for agreed Incidents. The procedure for creating and
modifying KELS is in the PinICL Reference Data Guide CM/MAN/005.

At the discretion of the Incident/Defect Manager and Pathways Programme
Management the QFPF review deferrals:

System Test Incidents.
Business Test Incidents.

All Incidents associated with a baseline being released into the live
service.

Live calls recommended for deferral by the QFPF are sent to the RMF for
approval. A clone call is arranged to progress the Incident at the nominated
deferred release whilst the original is returned to the RMF for consideration.
The text is updated to reflect the priority perceived with a recommendation
for closure as fixed in a future release. This is either agreed at RMF (and the
Incident closed by the SSC) or a live fix is requested and the Incident
returned to QFP.

Business Requirements via their QFPF representative are asked to approve
all deferrals beyond the next Target Release.

All decisions agreed by either the RMF or QFPF are recorded in the
Incident.

Inputs/Triggers: I Incidents with Potential Solutions Identified.

Process Rationale:

DE/PRO/003 ICL Pathway Development Directorate Processes
CM/PRD/001 Software Configuration Management Version
Control and CM/PRD/003 Work Package request are applicable
to this Process.

The relevant Delivery Unit undertakes detailed analysis work
identifying the fix to be made.

A check is made to establish that the work can be completed for
the Target Release identified. If this is not the case or the detail
of the fix has changed it is returned to QFP for further
consideration.

A further check is made to ensure no contract controlled
documents are impacted e.g. PPDs. If there are impacts the
Incident must be sent to the TDA as a change management
action.

If a number of software baselines are being progressed in
parallel then a clone PinICL is required to track each change to
each baseline. A common example would be a live fix where a
clone of the Live fix would be required to the current baseline
being developed. The procedure for creating clone PinICLs is
identified in the PinICL Reference Data Guide CM/MAN/005.

The fix is Unit and Link Tested then delivered by PIT ready for
testing by the Call Logger.

A handover note is produced identifying dependencies etc. This
is documented in CM/PRD/001 Software Configuration
Management Version Control.

Build Incidents are analysed by TI who either accept and fix the
defect or reject for further analysis by QFP as more likely a
Delivery Unit Incident.

Inputs/Triggers:

Suspected build Incidents passed directly to TI for action.
Suspected build Incidents from QFP.
Fix fails for correction.

Potential Product Defects with approved Target Release from
either RMF or QFPF.

Sub Processes: None.
Resources: Delivery Units.
Technical Integration.
Outputs: Resolved defects ready for testing.

Potential Product Defects returned to QFP for further
consideration (either from TI or delivery units).

Process Rationale:

Call originator is responsible for defect closure.

All defects are passed to a test team to verify that the fault has
been fixed.

Arrange for their test rig to be updated with the new software.

On successful test the defect is either closed as tested
successfully or updated as tested successfully and routed to Call
Logger for closure.

Fix fails are rejected for rework.
