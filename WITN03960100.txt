POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF Stephen John Wiseall

I, Stephen John Wiseall, will say as follows
INTRODUCTION

1. I was the Acceptance manager for the for the HNG-X Programme in 2010,
this covered what at the time was Release 2 that followed the first HNG-X
release. I was fulfilling this role on a temporary basis for a few months until a
permanent Post Office employee was identified to replace me.

As per my earlier communication, I was not and have never been an
employee of Post Office Ltd, I was working for Post Office as a permanent
employee of a services supplier named Acutest Ltd — a test consultancy who

provided testing services for Post Office for HNG-X and other programmes.

2. From September 2006 until early 2010 I was a Test Analyst working on the
HNG-X programme. Again, this was as a permanent emplov'~

supplier named Acutest Ltd.

3. Prior to starting with Post Office I had 6 years testing experience. As part of
my employment with Acutest (while working with Post Office) I also completed
the ISTQB / BCS Intermediate Software Testing Certificate.

4. I did not receive specific training for these roles, however internally Acutest
had a programme of training and development that I attended covering

various aspects of testing, change management and the use of testing tools.

DESIGN OF HNG-X

I have been asked to consider FUJ00002113, FUJ00002114, FUJ00002229,

FUJ00002245, FUJO0002420, FUJ00003498 and FUJ00003499

5. My recollection is that I did not have any input into their creation and did not

personally review these documents and provide feedback. Part of my role as
a test analyst prior to 2010 was to coordinate document reviews across the
Joint Test Team (made up of Post Office and Acutest test resource),
consolidate feedback comments and share with the document owners.
Post 2010 as part of my role as Acceptance Manager I was again responsible
for coordination and ensuring that team members fed back comments in a

structured way.
Note that I no longer worked on the HNG-X programme when the document
FUJ00002420 was issued on 12-JUL-2011, I finished with Post Office in early

2011.

6. I do not have anything to comment on within these documents.

7. From memory the ‘Post Office Ltd - Test Analysis’ were the Joint Test Team
made up of Post Office permanent employees and consultants provided by
Acutest Ltd.

My recollections are that the Acutest team members focused on testing the
front end point of sale system and non-functional aspects (including

performance).

This team was not involved in the design of HNG-X but was responsible for

test analysis, test preparation and test execution. The team would have also
raised defects when actual behaviour deviated from expected behaviour and
then any retesting following defect fixes — all prior to the initial rollout of HNG-

xX.

From memory the Post Office part of the team focussed more on the backend
and reporting parts of HNG-X, but as I was not as close to their day to day

activities, I am unable to remember their detailed responsibilities.

8. Given my roles and the time I worked with Post Office I had a basic
knowledge of how some parts of HNG-X operated — the majority being the

front end point of sale system.
9. My recollection is that I personally received a number of demonstrations of

HNG-X, these were largely in the form of handovers of functionality from the

Fujitsu teams.

WITNO3960100

I also remember a demonstration done in the model office by Post Office staff
covering basic operations and transactions.
These were only ever high level and their aim was not so that I could be a

user of HNG-X.

DEVELOPMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF HNG-X

I have been asked to consider POL00033102, POL00033107 and POL00033109

10. A. I am unable to provide any further information than that included in these

1

=

documents.

B. I am unable to provide any further information than that included in these
documents.

C. My role as the Acceptance Manager was to support the collation,
presentation and review of the contents of this document to the Acceptance

Board for that board to then decide on progress.

.My recollection is that Post Office put a lot of effort (there was a sizable,

dedicated team responsible for this) into the requirements that defined HNG-
X, both in terms of the use cases that defined the functional aspects and other
requirements that defined the other aspects of the system. Again, my
recollection is that there were changes to the requirements over time following
feedback from both Fujitsu, the Joint Test Team and other teams within Post

Office.

12.Given my knowledge of HNG-X, the breadth of functionality and complexity of

the system I’m not able to provide comment on how well the HNG-X system

Page 4 of 10
WITN03960100
WITNO3960100

functioned. I'm not in a position to comment on the pilot scheme as I was not

involved in that programme activity.

13.1 personally do not remember feeling pressure to ensure that the migration to
HNG-X happened within a short time frame, however I was not involved in the

. decisions involving the migration to HNG-X or the actual migration itself.

BUGS / ERRORS / DEFECTS
I have been asked to consider FUJ00081564
14. I do not remember this document so cannot comment on who produced it.
Note that the version shared is very difficult to read/navigate as it spans 360

pages but only around 10 of these appear to have coritent.

15.1 cannot comment on this as I do not remember this document or being

involved in this forecasting.

I have been asked to consider POLO0001493, POL00001499, POL00001509,
POL00001521, POLO00001556, and POL00039627.
16.1 cannot add anything additional to what is included in the bugs/errors/defects

extracts that have been shared.
17.Given the scope of my role in HNG-X I am unable to comment on this.

18.From memory my interaction with the PEAK system was to set the Quality

Centre (QC) defects to be sent across to PEAK once it was agreed as a

Page 5 of 10
WITN03960100
WITNO3960100

Fujitsu defect. There was a two-way synchronisation in place between QC
and PEAK so that both tools always had the latest information. I don’t believe
I ever had access to PEAK directly, only to QC where I made the updates to

send the defects to PEAK.

Note that QC was the test management tool used across the programme to

manage testing activity such as test execution and defects.

19.As I did not have access or use PEAK, I cannot comment on this. I also had
no visibility of service tickets that were added directly into PEAK, only PEAK
incident updates for those that originated from and were synchronised with

Qc

I have been asked to consider POL00032629 and POL00032633
20.1 cannot remember the details of these two defects or if they were resolved

before a final draft was issued.

21.1 assume this refers to “...two requirements GLB-2214 / 5219 which are
showing as failed in QC but have no defects. Again, Steve is to progress
these.” I cannot remember the details of these two requirements with no

defects or how the issue was progressed.

HORIZON LITIGATION
22.1 do not have any recollection of these bugs from my time working on the
HNG-X programme.

23.1 was not aware of any additional issues that arose that I could add to this.

REFLECTIONS
24.1 believe that I carried out my role with diligence and personally have no
specific things I would have done differently.
25.1 do not know enough about the scandal as a whole so cannot comment on
this.

26.1 have no specific points to raise on this.
