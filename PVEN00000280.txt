Hi Angela, | wondered how you are and what lockdown is like for you? Are you and your family well and safe?

It's been v strange working very hard only from home. Horizon crops up with more difficulties from time to time but it has
been overtaken by more pressing issues, esp at the NHS.

| hope you are ok? You are often in my thoughts as | try to ‘keep things in boxes’ as you once said. V wise!

Take care, Paula

Hi Paula. Good to hear from you - we are all keeping well thank you. | hope you are too? Lockdown has
been 24/7 working on CV19 crisis management for me in recent weeks. However | leave PO on Monday. Just finalising the
details of my agreement and it’s not common knowledge in work yet but the time is right for me to leave. The last year has
reinforced that for me. Don’t know what I'll do going forward yet but I’m looking forward to pastures new. I’m glad some things
| said have been useful for you. Take care. It'll be good to catch up properly once we get through the other side. NHS is doing
a fantastic job btw - you must be very proud @
