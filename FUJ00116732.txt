Objectives

The objectives of this review were:
+To review the detailed delivery plans and ensure they:

*are complete, transparent and credible, with the detailed (L4) plans rolling up and
matching the high level (L1) summary plan

*contain dependencies between work streams and strands which are accurately and
consistently reflected throughout

*are clearly understood by each delivery unit who are planning and committed to
resource them as required

*To verify the Estimated Cost to Complete i.e. the costs that will be incurred from the point
of the review to the point where the baselined deliverables have been achieved and the
programme can be closed

To assure the integrity of programme and project management activities and provide
balanced feedback to the Senior management team

«Whilst it will take account of service levels achieved, it will not focus on service
delivery methods or processes. It will however make observations as
appropriate where service-related activities impact project delivery or vice versa

Programme Overview

+ Fujitsu Services agreed CCN1200 on 31 Aug 2006, continuing its long-term relationship with
the Royal Mail, to re-architect the current system in order to provide a cost-effective, modern
and agile Post Office Counter service.

+Fujitsu is contracted to deliver the design, development, operation and support of various
applications which provide front and back office functionality to PO Ltd's business: taken
together these applications are known as Horizon. HNG-X is an update to the Horizon front
end counter system which aims to provide equivalent functionality and some new features at a
reduced total cost of ownership; HNG-X Infrastructure is being designed and implemented as
part of the HNG-X Programme.

* The HNG-x programme comprises the following areas of work:
+ Application Development
+ Infrastructure Design and Build
+ Test and Validation
+ Data centre migration
+ Deployment to approx 30,000 counters at 11,000 Post Offices

+ Approved at CAR, the TCV July 06 = £51.2m
+ Approved at CAR, the TCV 18 Sept 08 = £77.7m

+Early baseline timescales were based on completion of rollout by April 2009. The last draft
plan (v80) discussed with PO Ltd before this review forecast an end date of 22 Dec 09

Priority Findings

Schedule

ff Majority of Delivery leads expressed 75% confidence or higher in achievability of
Programme plan dated 21/05/09 v1

Finance

Before adjustment for BA recommendations on Cost to complete, this Programme is
forecasting a loss of £13.7m (-18%)

U Cost to Complete findings:
The following potential gaps or issues need to be addressed:
Missing Capital costs (£2.8m to be spent)
Missing PO Ltd delay costs estimated by Commercial Manager at £3m
Contingency provision of £2.2m does not align to Risk plan given to BA which
suggested a value between £2.9m and £3.6m
Detailed work stream costs missing certain new positions in the Programme
organisation e.g. End-to-end Programme Manager
Some cost profiles did not exactly match programme plan e.g. full size Development
team costed up to Data centre migration (mid Oct 09) rather than up to handover to
CS service (mid Nov 09)
Project Management
U. Significant volume of comments from Business Assurance of high importance on
Programme Plan, Risk Plan and Cost to Complete

f} PO Ltd have accepted there is no opportunity to squeeze the plan to achieve a March

Governance and Organisation

=> Lack of a properly joined-up programme leadership structure has been partly addressed
via appointment of a new Head of Programmes for PSD, an End-to-end Programme
Manager, an experienced PMO Manager and an experienced Test Manager; the revised
leadership team now need to “gel” to become an effective team

=> Communication to the programme team is improving but it must improve further in quality
and frequency

Priority Recommendations

1. Address as a priority BA detailed comments on Programme plan, risk plan and Cost to
Complete; seek internal and customer approval of revised baseline document set
2. Improve cost forecasting via use of detailed level 4 resourced plans that align to the
Programme plan
3. Conduct internal assurance of financial reports provided to Programme Management by
the work streams.
4. End-to-end Programme Manager to set up/change attendance at the following meetings
with a view to ensuring a fully joined up programme management team:
+ Attendance by Delivery leads (e.g. Service Implementation Manager from IS) at
daily prayers meetings
. Regular reviews against plan, risks and cost to complete with Head of each Work
stream
+ Regular end-to-end programme review meeting led by Programme Director,
attended as today, by his management team, plus occasional attendance by the
new Head of Programmes for PSD
*  Re-format Release Strategy Board to determine and prioritise content of the
release for go live vs test

5. Improve the quality and frequency of Account wide internal communications

Findings (cont'd) Status : Red

=>Regular programme-wide financial reports produced on a weekly basis

=Effects of cost saving measures are not being visibly monitored and evaluated; some signs
cost-cutting was too severe (e.g. disbanding of PMO, in particular document management)

U Before adjustment for BA recommendations on Cost to complete, this Programme is
forecasting a loss of £13.7m (-18%)

U Contract is based on capped time and materials; Fujitsu is no longer invoicing since hitting
the maximum threshold for revenue recovery (112,000 mandays)

U BA was unable to get a clear and consistent view on the risk contingency agreed at CAR
18 Sept 09. A previous BA review in Aug 08 recommended a provision of £7.5m which is
recorded as approved in the CAR minutes. Actual provision made in the accounts was

1.5m

4 Historically much of the cost overrun was due to:
4) development effort greatly exceeding estimates (this has been the subject of previous
reviews)
4 lack of revision of HNG cost estimates for HNG-x solution differences at time of bid
response
4 Cost forecasting is based on a run rate and elapsed time basis
U. Management appraisal of actual costs at a task level is limited to Development deliverables
U. Spotlight FSRs do not give a programme wide view of the financial status (only produced
for Development, Test and DC Migration)

Recommendations
1.

Address Cost to Complete detailed findings and re-seek internal authorisation to
proceed via Fujitsu Programme Board

Improve cost forecasting via use of detailed level 4 resourced plans that align to the
Programme plan

Conduct internal assurance of financial reports provided to Programme Management
by the work streams.

Document the management decisions that have resulted in a change to the risk
provision agreed at CAR

Responsibility for financial contro! should be delegated throughout the management
structure in line with CPM-22

Ensure Spotlight reporting for financials includes a programme wide view

Future projects for Royal Mail should use Earned Value Analysis to measure actual

U Lack of a coherent Infrastructure Team structure, with a clear management line, accepted
accountability, and with better responsiveness to programme direction and progress
tracking/reporting needs

4. 138 non functional requirements do not have a test plan
U Confusion as to whether all CS requirements are documented and lodged in Requirements
tool (DOORS)
As at the end of SV&l cycle 5, functional test pass rate is 77% against a target of 95%
U Although Development management team are confident of addressing functional defects, the
joint review process which will inform acceptance, does not yet include:
J. non-functional requirements and
U the backlog of approx 1000 defects
U Confusion over role and reporting line of the Lead CSA
) Lead CSA is not the design authority; this role is fulfilled by the CTO, who is also the
Application Development Work stream Manager

No regulated process of architectural assurance of designs, independent from the work
streams who produce them

J High turnover in Lead CSAs (4 in past 14 months)

U Complex architecture underpins HNG-x solution (nearly all bespoke; several programming
languages)

J) Introduced proprietary programming language (PDL) for counter which creates resourcing
issues for ongoing support and maintenance

Recommendations

1. See governance and organisation recommendations

2. Address lack of a clear management structure within the Infrastructure workstream

3. Introduce a process for Technical (architectural) assurance of technical artefacts

4. Investigate feasibility of an additional test rig and test resources to accelerate rate of
progress on non-functional requirements once network issues under control

5. Ensure the end-to-end programme plan (and associated risk plan) accurately reflect
the remaining work to clear defects (partly addressed)

6. Complete comprehensive network audit and take any remedial action required
(completed)

7. Review ona risk basis the priority 2 and below non-functional tests. Agree with PO Ltd
those candidate tests for de-scoping from Release 1 of HNG-x

8. Clarify requirements management process and how this relates to acceptance — are
requirements traceability matrices really required? If not, stop this work

9. Investigate possibility of accelerating incomplete designs by increasing architectural
resources (since planned to complete by 04/07/09)

10. Prioritise remedial work to address inconsistencies between design and

implementation of infrastructure

ft PO Ltd is willing to be pragmatic in order to get this programme successfully delivered

=>Internal Programme Board within PO Ltd for HNG-x programme

=PO Ltd Programme Manager thought that the management style of empowerment adopted
by the Fujitsu Programme Director is not effective at work stream level — this concern has
been partly addressed by appointment of an End-to-end Programme Manager to support the
Programme Director

Across the board PO Ltd felt that a lack of openness has started to become apparent in the
relationship between Fujitsu and PO Ltd (deteriorated over time) — this concern is beginning
to be addressed through a series of Senior Executive joint engagements

U It was stated by all those interviewed that Fujitsu had built up a strong reputation of delivering
to time and within budget and that we are now losing credibility as a reliable supplier within
PO Ltd — this concern will be addressed once Fujitsu deliver to an agreed robust plan going
forward

. Lead CSA should be part of the HNG-x SMT
+ Clarify roles and responsibilities within Test (e.g. is migration testing under Migration
or under Test?)

(Work-in-progress)

Improve the quality and frequency of Account wide internal communications e.g. produce
and publish a correct up-to-date organisation chart for the entire programme (in recent
communication Jim Sweeting shown as DR to Graham Murray and to Vince Cochrane)
(Work-in-progress)

Produce ToRs for all personnel engaged on the programme (Work-in-progress)
Produce/update Stakeholder Management plan and supporting Communications Plan
Consider organising a special HNG-x communications event to address morale issues
and to communicate the revised plan throughout the organisation

Review and document meeting governance. Consideration should be given to attendance
by Delivery Leads at some management meetings and the need for additional meetings
to facilitate proactive management of deliverables and dependencies

U Significant volume of comments from Business Assurance of high importance on Programme

be revised in line with BA advice

ii. I Calculate a new contingency provision consistent with risk plan findings
iii. Seek approval of new contingency provision at Business Unit level

2. Assign a responsible owner to ensure best practise risk management is followed (normally
a PMO function) (Work-in-progress)
3. Continue to exploit expertise within Business Assurance on risk management at periodic
intervals until effective and proactive risk management works like clockwork

4. Once network issues under control, consider investment in an additional test rig or
expansion of current test rig capability
