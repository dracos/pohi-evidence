Warwick,
As discussed, here is version 0.3 of the Witness statement which should contain responses to all your comments.

I'll now go through it and remove all the strike out and colours and boxes and check through for any remaining typos to
provide a clean version 1.0 which can be submitted.

Regards

Gareth

Dear Gareth,

Thank you very much for your 2nd draft. You are quite right to rebuff me when I have been
asking too much! I have added a few more comments, this time in green. There are
naturally enough some typos, some of which I have pointed out. Obviously please do a
careful typo check before completing the document. Is it possible within the framework of
the statement to put in paragraph numbers? It will help when you give your evidence.

I received the Professor's final version last night. I have not yet had a chance to read it in
detail. I will try to speak to you late morning. I anticipate that it should be possible to serve
your completed statement by 4pm today.

As ever, many thanks.
