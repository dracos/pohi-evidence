summary: SVIC8 - Audit - Filtering - Integrity check for Riposte bypassed
incident Description:

fest Set: AUD/RET BTQ - Branch Transaction Query Processor
fest: [1]NFUN_HST AUD RET M0091 Workstation - HNG-x Filtering & Viewing - Data Integrity Checks
Run: Run 9-2 15-27-34

lrest Parameters:
step: Step 3

Description:
Using the identified ARQ and it's target data exercise the workstation ‘Data Integrity Checks' functionality referencing both
IDES/APP/HLD/0029 and IA/PRO/004 - Audit Data Extraction Process

expected:
Functionality is available and functions as specified

lactual:
FAILED:
changed the second entry in the file for FAD "159546" - Modified the FAD to 259546 which was my attempt to bypass Integrity
checks.

Filtering therefore bypassed the line when Filtering and as such no “crc” check was performed BUT it should have shown up as a
Sequence Gap” which it did not.

[this Test would have to assume someone has access to the ARC server in order to manipulate the data extracted from the Audit
centera.

However, the "Sequence Gap" check is a fallback for this happening.

Please route to Audit-Dev for review and comment.

ended the second line for FAD 159546 to 259546 to avoid CRC checking:
Message: <GroupId:159546><Id: 1><Num:37645>... 6.
kKMessage:<GroupId:259546><Id:1><Num:37646>..

alidation of the data correctly reported "Size of Gaps: 159546: 1 37646-37646".
