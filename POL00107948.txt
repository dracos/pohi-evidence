All,

Please find attached latest draft Briefing Note, which has sought to incorporate the feedback to date so far as I have
been able.

i have not amended the Annexes to the Note - the document is already quite long and will need an Exec Summary, and I
would like to discuss with Alwen and Mark how much detail we need to go into in the Annexes.

Please let me have any comments. I will continue to refine the document in the meantime.

Kind regards, Rodric

I think it will be easier for Paula if she gets one brief so this should be in it

Thanks

Does this need to go to Paula or should it be included in Rods briefing, or even both?

A couple of comments:

Can we change the reference from Bug to fault.
DONE

Given what Andy has sent to us late Friday ~ were these branches disadvantaged ~ ie did they have to
put their own money in and if so for how long? From his summary it wasn’t clear to me.

YES THEY WERE DISADVANCED FOR THE AMOUNTS SHOWN IN THE TABLE. FOR APPROX 6 MONTHS
(WE HAVE TO BE APPROX BECAUSE DIFFERENCE SUBPOSTMASTERS EXPERIENCED THE BUG IN
DIFFERENT MONTHS.

And if they did have to put their own money in, at what point did we reimburse them and did we give
ther so sort of additional payment due to inconvenience.

WE REIMBURSED THEM IN MARCH 2011. I DON’T BELIEVE ANY PAYMENT WAS MADE FOR
INCONVENIENCE (WE ARE TALKING ABOUT £115 AS THE WORST CASE)

Thx

Gina: Can you print a copy for my SS file. Thx

March 2011 Letters sent to branches and corrections made

Problem Description
e The problem occurs as part of the process of moving Discrepancies into Local Suspense.

e There was a defect, introduced as part of HNG, that in certain circumstances meant that
discrepancies were not properly cleared to Local Suspense.
e This means that the gain or loss remained, unresolved, within the discrepancy account.

If the sub postmaster did not look at their Final Balance Report carefully, they would have been

unaware of this issue.

The impact would have been that in order to balance, sub postmasters would have to either put
their own money in (a disadvantage to the sub postmaster) or taken money out (an advantage
to the sub postmaster)

e This problem was automatically picked up by the system, which had been designed to flag up
these type of discrepancies

Impact to sub postmasters
In total 62 branches were impacted
® Out of these 17 were sub postmaster branches (not crowns or multiples) who were
disadvantaged
¢ The amount they were disadvantaged by is shown below
e The losses were made good by Post Office in March 2011. These means that most of the Sub
Postmasters below would have held the loss on average for 6 months.

<image003.png>

Why did it take so long to resolve?
e Priority and distinction from other service issues that were happening at the time of the HNG
rollout
e Complexity of understanding the root cause
e Getting agreement and clarity on how best to communicate this to branches
