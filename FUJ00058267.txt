1. Drop-Out Analysis

Install Teams Timing Out:
PON have raised concerns over the number of outlets being aborted on Install day due
to delays at earlier installs. The actual number of instances of Install teams timing out
is slightly higher than shown in the Drop-Out report. TS made the point that the Install
teams timing out are not due to delays caused by Exel, the root cause is due to delays
encountered during the install process at an earlier site. The tactics being deployed rely
on the IP teams moving the Install teams onto the next outlet if significant delays are
being encountered.
TS will look at the details for the 2 outlets that were aborted on Monday 22/5/00.
08/06/00 - TS handed over details of outlets that had been aborted due to Install
Teams timing out over a period of 4 weeks (8" May to 2™ June). MO/BE to analyse
the information outside the meeting.

Action 25/05/01 _TS CLOSED
Drop-Out Report:
Electronic copy of report was not received by PON prior to meeting. RZ to ensure that
copies are sent to PON via email in good time.
22/06 - Reports were sent. Action 08/06/01 RZ CLOSED

The number of outlets suspended and ready for re-scheduling is now shown on the
report. In order to give a complete picture of re-schedules it was agreed to introduce
the following figures into the next report:
(dd) No. of outlets suspended and not ready for re-scheduling
(2) Actual no. of outlets re-scheduled.
22/06 - Figures were provided at the meeting, but will be included on the next report.
529 offices suspended
179 offices Suspend/Release
769 offices Infrastructure Suspends
207 offices released from Infrastructure/ not yet reschedu;led

06/07 - Closed Action 08/06/02 SB Closed
SB agreed to provide a breakdown of the 769 Infrastructure suspends to show
Pathway/PON suspends.

06/07 - Closed Action 22/06/01 SB Closed

SB provided initial analysis of 518 suspended offices out of 725.

SB to provide details of the NFC outlets to BE

New Action 06/07/01 SB
Consistent Reporting:
RZ to ensure that the IP teams are consistent in reporting against failure categories
within the Activity Tracking Database (ATDB). This is particularly necessary when a
nation-wide problem occurs as per Friday 16" June, where 26 outlets that were aborted
were reported against different categories.
06/07 - Closed Action 22/06/02 RZ Closed

Following the national problem on Friday 16" June, PON have believe there is a
requirement for a policy document explaining recovery actions.
MO is compiling a document which due for distribution on 27" June.

Action 22/06/03 MO Closed

Rescheduling Capped Outlets:
SB to confirm that all capped outlets have been released for rescheduling.

2. Trends:

22/06/00 - No change in the trends.

08/06/00 - No change in the trends. PON are concerned about the number of ISDN.
faults leading to Install day aborts.

25/05/00 - Slight increase in the number of drop-outs due to ISDN faults and concern
from PON raised about outlets aborted on the day due to Install teams being delayed at
earlier installs; PON's view is that there should be some contingency for these
situations. The actual number of instances on Install teams timing out is slightly higher
than shown in the Drop-Out report.

11/05/00 - No significant change in the trends. Key trends from the report continue to
show drop-outs due to ISDN related problems and issues with the Postmaster/outlet,
e.g. resignations, relocations and closures.

2/04/00 - No change in the trends from previous report.

31/03/00 - The number of drop-outs over the 16 week period is still showing a slight
downward trend. Main reason for drop-outs prior to install week continues to be
ISDN, and resignations, relocations and closures.

MO stated that PON will be running a series of workshops for the HFSO's during
September (4 week period), which will have an impact on installs. The contractual
level will be maintained.

17/03/00 - No change in the trends from previous report.
01/03/00 - Key trends from the report continue to show drop-outs due to ISDN related
problems and issues with the Postmaster/outlet, e.g. resignations, relocations and

closures.

06/07/00 - No change in the trends from previous report

3. Recommendations:

06/07/00 - No new recommendations.

4. Scheduling Issues:

Relocated Offices coming back into the Programme:

Relocated offices will come back into the Install Programme as Horizon Compliant.
They may come back with the same FAD code. Clarification of the process is required.
MO agreed to check with the HIMs as to what will be the next event when these offices
are released.

11/5 - MO reported that the "next event" will be the next event that has not yet
commenced. Action: 12/04/04. MO CLOSED

11/5 - The Compliant Office process needs to be updated to show appropriate events
(relative to the Install Programme) that take place when the office is released.
22/06 - BE stated that PON shall ensure that the process is amended. PON shall
inform Pathway on the activities that have been completed at an office when it is
handed over. It was agreed to close the action.

Action 11/05/03 BE CLOSED

Re-scheduling Priority Offices:
We may need to go outside the geography to install priority offices, this side of the
second sweep. ( e.g. Leigh-on Sea, Kings Lynn) MO will discuss the concept with the
HIMs and an escalation process. Any existing offices in this category need to be
identified.
11/5 - MO reported that the HIMs would like to do this.

Action: 12/04/05_MO CLOSED

Pathway need to consider whether this can be done.
11/5 - It was agreed that Pathway could incorporate this into the re-scheduling
process. The priority offices would normally be ECCO. A waiver would be required
from PON on travelling to courses and course occupancy. The volume would have to
be very low and controlled through PON Central (specifically BE/MO). The re-
scheduling document needs to be amended to reflect these changes.

Action 12/04/06 _RZ/TS CLOSED

Rescheduling document may need amending. SB to check.
22/06 - The document will be re-issued next week with amendments.
Action: 11/05/04 SB CLOSED

Suspend/Release of Outlets:

PON raised the question on whether release information was passed across to PON.
SB to check and to liaise with Jonathan Bissett on transfer of information on suspends
and release of outlets.

25/5 - SB reported that data was not automatically passed to PON. SB needs to re-
align the Activity Tracking Database and the RODB then pass the lists at periodic
intervals to PON (i.e. every 2 weeks).

Target for completion for next meeting.

08/06/00 - Should be complete next week

22/06/00 - Aiming to complete before next meeting.

Proposal for Phase Y (Installs):
SB briefly discussed Pathway's proposal for the second sweep, known as Phase Y.
This involves entering outlets into the Install Programme where there may be
Infrastructure work still outstanding, on the basis that this work will be complete
before the Install date.
SB to produce an outline proposal prior to the next meeting, to allow time for PON to
consider the proposal.
08/06/00 - To be completed end of next week (16/6/00)

more of these offices (scheduled after Christmas) to be brought forward to be installed
before end January 2001.

Action 08/06/03_ SB CLOSED

Clarification is required on the number of ECCO ALPS offices versus Manual ALPS.

Review Date: 06/07/00

This was one of the outlets affected by the Kingston Communications issue. It was
scheduled for today (8/6/00) but could not go ahead as the staff had not been trained
by KPL. PON are secking an assurance that this was a one off incident and KPL are
aware of training dates for these re-scheduled outlets.
22/06/00 - SB has looked through the list of outlets with KnowledgePool . There was
only I outlet which was outside the 10-day window. This outlet has a different PO id
and will need to be suspended and re-scheduled.

Action 08/06/04 SB CLOSED

Tirril(342410):
This outlet was installed and migrated successfully, the SPMR then decided to resign.
The ISDN line was subsequently removed. TS to request Energis to re-install the line,
ideally with the same ISDN no. PON require an assurance that the existing process
will prevent a re-occurrence . TS to get the outlet back to a live state.
22/06/00 - The ISDN line has been re-instated. A trap is now in-place to prevent a re-
occurrence.

Action 08/06/05 TS CLOSED.

MO to raise a CR to enable 'closed' outlets on the RoDB to be reinstated

New Action 06/07/05 MO

7. Installation Activities

ISDN

22/06 - Daily reviews between Pathway and Energis have now started to review recent
ISDN faults.

08/06 - Meetings have been held between Pathway and Energis at Director level.
Energis have given assurances that they are dealing with the problem of high numbers
of ISDN faults. There is a need to determine the root cause analysis of ISDN fails on
install day. Daily reviews with Energis/BT are to be started.

25/5 - There has been an increase in the number of "on the day" ISDN faults leading
to aborted outlets. Pathway have had meetings with Energis seeking an improvement in
the situation. Energis have re-affirmed their commitment to reduce the number of
faults.

The automated ISDN line test process was found not to be working properly which
meant that a manual process had to be used. This may have contributed to the recent
increase in the number of ISDN faults.

TS to advise on resolution, and confirm whether the day -10 check is automated or
manual.

08/06 - The process is robotic with manual input.

Action 25/05/04 TS CLOSED

11/5 - We are still seeing some failures on install day. No new issues raised.
12/04/00 - Two different problems were recently experienced with BT/Energis:

(a) ISDN Lines were not configured into the Closed User Group (CUG),
which was a process failure.
(b) 5 ISDN Wrong Numbers were notified to Pathway too late for recovery

action resulting in lost outlets.
Energis have been tackled about both incidents.

31/03/00 - ISDN circuits now being checked at day -10 and day -2. This has resulted
in a decrease in the number of aborts due to ISDN faults.

TS to provide input to the meeting by end of July to illustrate the results of the
initiatives underway to better understand and avoid ISDN failures.
New Action 06/07/06 __TS

TS to provide data on the number of ISDN failure aborts that have been
released/rescheduled.
New Action 06/07/07 TS

8. Counter Discrepancies

25/05 - MO stated that there have been recent incidents where a Counter Discrepancy

has occurred and the install has gone ahead by Pathway over-installing. PON are

concerned that information on the correct number of counters had been passed to

Pathway but had not been processed in time.

RZ to check with ROHD on what's being done to address these concerns.

08/06 - RZ stated that the ROHD had significantly reduced their backlogs of Calls and

fax's waiting to be processed. Therefore the existing processes should be sufficient to

prevent a re-occurrence of request for changes not being processed in sufficient time.
Action 25/05/05 RZ CLOSED

12/04: Change Counter Numbers confirmations are now coming through. Some of the
IP regions are phoning each office to confirm the number of positions prepared for

Horizon,

RZ/SB to check what's coming through into Pathway from the regions, and to run off
a report from the RODB.

11/5 - Check was undertaken and the results show a small decrease in the number of
discrepancies. Action 12/04/07 _RZ/SB CLOSED
BE agreed to ask Jonathan Bissett to send a new list that Pathway could compare with
the RODB.

22/06 - Carried forward. Action 11/05/09 BE Closed

31/03: The number of outlets with discrepancies is reducing. The various checks are
now making an impact.

TS agreed to look at a process to define liability for a Counter Discrepancy.
31/03 - TS recommended that initial discussions should occur within PON central,
rather than the IP regions. MO will discuss this with the HIMs.

9. PON Issues

Outlets with Restricted Vehicle Access:
Due to recent problems with vehicle access to outlets, the question was raised on the
level of information within the Completion Packs relating to parking restrictions. TS
agreed to check. It may be necessary to modify the Call script to outlets.
11/5 - The check revealed that parking restrictions were in force and that there was
suitable parking nearby, however this was unsuitable.
BE raised the problem of ‘red-routes’ in London and how were Exel going to manage
this situation. TS agreed to check. It was proposed that the Call scripts are revised.
25/5 - TS has asked Exel to provide a Strategy for operating in London and to look at
modifying the Call scripts. Update at next meeting.
08/06 - Waiting for information from Exel.
22/06 - Some information has been obtained from Exel. Ongoing

Action 12/04/08 TS Closed

ECCO BOP Removal:

PON raised the issue of too many BOPs being left behind by the Exel Install teams
which results in HFSO's having to pick them up. TS stated that Exel will leave the
BOP if the HFSO's do not free them up.

The HFSO's need to be told to ensure that they tell Exel that the BOP is available for
removal.

Freeing up the BOP on a Wednesday night is likely to take longer than other days due
to weekly balancing activities. This could threaten the "ECCO on Wednesdays" CCN.
(Note: CCN has not yet been received by PON, RZ to chase)

BE agreed to check with Farnborough for times of polls, and to communicate with the
HFSO's the need to free up the BOPs.
08/06 - Ad hoc polls must be requested and confirmed by 18:1Shrs.

Action: 25/05/07 BE CLOSED

TS agreed to obtain data from Exel on BOP's being left behind and the reasons.

Pathway Issues

St George's Rd (120907): "Half-processed OBC20's"

Exel expected to install 3 counters at this outlet, however, an OBC20 was received to
decrease the number of counters to 2, which had not been fully processed. This delayed
the Exel team on-site and resulted in later installs being aborted.

OBC20 change requests need to be stopped prior to install day to prevent a repeat of
this problem. This can be done by either rejecting the OBC20 or holding it until after
the install.

MO agreed to check on the required action.
