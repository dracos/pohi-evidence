Dear Amy,

2pm would be fine for me.

Can I suggest that we start with a call with me & Gideon, please?
We can then brief David and he can give a view on the documents.
Best,

Owain

call this afternoon to discuss the below matter in more detail — would 2pm or 4pm be convenient for you?

> Freeths have raised some queries about the redactions applied by Post Office to two documents in the trial
bundle. These are G/40 (POL-0218577) and G/44 (POL-0219338) - redacted and unredacted copies of these

documents can be found in the attached zip file.

“unredacted —-G40" document.

> The background to the action summary is: in 2014 and as part of the Mediation Scheme, Linklaters
produced a piece of advice for Post Office on the complaints made by SPMRs about Horizon. A copy of this
advice is attached. Linklaters recommended that Deloitte undertake a review of the integrity of Horizon —
this review is known as Project Zebra and a copy of Deloitte's report is also attached.

>

> Post Office's position is that the Deloitte report was produced on the recommendation of Linklaters and for
the purpose of understanding Post Office's litigation risk if the mediation scheme collapsed. The Cs do not
know of the existence of Deloitte report (save for the fact that there is an internal expert appointed by POL,
which was not allowed to be included in its costs budget).

> The Zebra Action Summary is an ancillary document which was produced by Post Office in response to
the Deloitte Report which sets out how controls suggested by the Deloitte Report could be implemented into
practice. Whilst the Action Summary itself is not a privileged document, following a call with Tony and
Simon we took the decision to redact from this document any references to the Deloitte Report on the basis

Development Director) for the Audit and Risk Committee on the recovery of agent losses. The document
itself is not privileged but on page 4 redactions have been applied where reference has been made to legal
advice/ litigation decisions during the mediation scheme to not pursue the recovery of debt and the
reactivation of this policy during the Group Action.

any redactions can be removed (Freeths second letter of 22 October 2018).

Bates documents has been redacted on the grounds of privilege — a clip of the correspondence and copy of
the document in question is attached.
