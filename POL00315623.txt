Hi George

We are being pretty robust in pushing back to be honest - not necessarily always reported!
Not really sure what he is getting at here?

Hi George,

Roland Gribben at The Telegraph is enquiring about whether there is an update about
Horizon (see below).

I haven’t spoken to him yet. Is there any further to say at the moment or date for further
discussions?

Thanks,

Angela

Am pursuing story from different line using the federation's annual report and
details of PO reorganisation and its impact on the subs. Do you have any further
update, particularly when they meet to discuss future>
Thanks

Hi Roland,

Here’s the statement we released after the select committee hearing at the beginning
of February.

George Thomson, General Secretary of the National Federation of SubPostmasters
(NFSP), said: “We remain confident that Horizon is a robust system, which carries
out tens of millions of transactions every week. The NFSP supports a swift and fair
conclusion to cases within the Post Office mediation scheme.”

Hope that helps,

Angela
