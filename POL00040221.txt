Belinda
As discussed, please find attached a draft letter to Tony re Part 2.

Being fresh from the mediation with Mrs Stubbs yesterday, I am now deeply concerned that the level of distrust by
Applicants (even ones as rational as Mrs Stubbs) of Horizon is going to be a major stumbling block to resolving

cases. The current Part 2 Report, with its highly speculative views, will only deepen that Applicants’ paranoia and no
amount of logic counter-argument from Post Office will change that position — the Applicants simply don't believe anything
that Post Office says. I'm now strongly of the view that Post Office should resist the release of the Part 2 Report in its
current form at pretty much all costs.

Kind regards
Andy
