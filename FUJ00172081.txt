Gents,

Please see draft output of Phase 0 from KPMG. At this point, I have not shared with them that plans may have
changed with POL (please keep this information to yourself please for time being), as I do not wish to disengage them

until we have an agreed deliverable that we can them potentially use to our advantage with POL.

I have asked Carole to set up a session for us to review as a team in order we can gain finalisation on this document.

Regards,

Mike

Dear Mike

Please find attached as promised the draft report from our Phase 0 review for review and comment prior to
finalisation.

I have discussed the controls per assertion with Torstein and Gareth last Thursday and revised the list subsequent to

our discussions on that topic.
They haven’t seen the report in this format so I presume you will copy them in so that they can comment as
appropriate.

What would be a good day to catch up on a call to receive feedback/ comments/ discuss as appropriate?
Best regards
