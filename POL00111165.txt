Post Office Group Litigation
DRAFT Update for Board Sub-Committee on 24 September 2018

1. Common Issues Trial - November 2018

121

1.2

1.3

1.4

Witness Statements were exchanged on 24 August 2018 setting out the factual evidence to
be presented to the Court by individual witnesses (i.e. the six Lead Claimants and 14 Post
Office staff members). This was the last substantial exchange of information between the
parties about the Common Issues before the trial starts.

Now that all information has been exchanged, Counsel are reviewing the opinion they gave
on the merits of Post Office’s case in May 2018, and will provide an update on that opinion
on 28 September 2018.

As anticipated, the Claimants included in their Witness Statements very substantial material
which we are advised is inadmissible for the Common Issues trial (30-50% of the Lead
Claimants’ statements).

Post Office has therefore applied to “strike out” that evidence (i.e. remove it from the Court
record) to help focus our defence preparations on relevant issues, and ensure trial time is
not wasted on inadmissible and irrelevant material. That application will be heard on 10
October 2018, there being no earlier hearing time.

1.5 On 19 September 2018, the Managing Judge heard Post Office’s application for security for

costs. Post Office was successful in its application, with the Claimants (through their
litigation funders) being ordered to provide £3.9m security by way of deeds of indemnity
issued by recognised insurance companies. Post Office was also awarded its costs of the
application (the amount has not. yet been determined).

1.6 Despite making (and continuing to make) complaints about Post Office’s conduct of its

defence (e.g. the adequacy of document disclosure), the Claimants have not escalated any
of these into a formal application to the Court. Their ability to do so now is very limited
given the proximity. of the trial. Post Office’s admissibility/strike out application should
therefore be the only significant issue still to be resolved before the trial starts.

1.7 The trial timetable is still being finalised, but is currently shaping as follows:

1.7.1 Monday 5 and Tuesday 6 November 2018 - Reading Days (the parties will not attend
court while the judge reads into the Court's file).

1.7.2, Wednesday 7 November 2018 - Opening Statements (each side has half a day to
explain their case to the judge).

1.7.3 Cross-examination of witness on their Witness Statements will begin on Thursday 8
November 2018 (the timing and sequencing is still being finalised).

1.7.4 Closing submissions will follow cross-examination. These will most likely be given later
in the week commencing Monday 26 November 2018, after an interval of a couple of
days for written submissions to be drafted, and may extend into the week commencing
Monday 3 December 2018.

1.7.5 The Court will not sit on Fridays 9, 16 or 23 November 2018, but will be available to
address any specific issues that arise during the course of the trial.

1.8 Our communications plan is being developed to cover the:
1.8.1. trial (including the run up to it);
1.8.2. announcement of the judgment (and its consequences); and
1.8.3. implementation of any contingency planning (to the extent required).

1.9 The communications plan will also address social media activity, given our expectation that
a lot of claimants will seek to attend. They have requested a large court room, which the
judge has noted but cannot address until closer to the hearing given court allocation is

dependent on availability.

1.10 We are also aware that Nick Wallis, a freelance journalist with BBC connections, will attend
and report on each day of the trial.

2. Horizon Issues Trial - March 2019
A. The “Horizon Issues”

2.1 In addition to the Common Issues Trial, a second 20 day trial has been ordered to start on
11 March 2019 on 15 “Horizon Issues”, broadly summarised as:

2.1.1. The robustness of Horizon, including:
- the extent to which bugs, errors etc in Horizon could undermine Horizon’s ability
to process and record transactions and/or cause shortfalls; and
- the controls and measures in place to address them.
2.1.2 "Remote access", including whether Post Office and/or Fujitsu:
- were able to access transaction data remotely; and
- have had the ability/facility to insert, inject, edit or delete transaction data or
data in branch accounts.

2.1.3. The Horizon facilities available to Postmasters to identify problems with Horizon
and/or challenge its record of branch accounts.

2.1.4 The Horizon facilities available to:

- Post Office to identify possible causes of branch shortfalls; and
- Post Office and Fujitsu to access and amend branch accounts.

(A full list of the full Horizon Issues is attached as Appendix 1 to this Report.)

2.2. The Court has directed that the Horizon Issues should be resolved through expert evidence
without reference to individual Claimants’ experiences (which, by definition, would not be
common to the wider group of Claimants).

2.3 The Claimants’ expert is Jason Coyne of IT Group. Post Office’s expert is Dr Robert Worden
of Charteris.

2.4 Between March and April 2018 Post Office provided (with Fujitsu’s support) demonstrations
of Horizon and disclosure of technical documents to the Claimants and Mr Coyne. Further
document disclosure was provided between in July and August 2018.

2.5 On 8 August 2018 Post Office also responded to requests for information from Mr Coyne,
who then had 10 days to challenge those responses if he considered them inadequate.

Although no challenge was received during that period, one was made on 19 September
2018 (i.e. some 4 weeks after the deadline).

2.6 On 17 August 2018 the Claimants provided a "Provisional/Outline Document” on the
Horizon issues, which had been ordered by the Court due to the lack of specific allegations
about what they say is wrong with Horizon. The allegations in the Provisional/Outline
Document remain very high-level, and are essentially that:

2.6.1 Horizon has had bugs; so
2.6.2 there is the possibility of further bugs; such that

2.6.3. Horizon is not robust (with the inference being that it could be responsible for
shortfalls in branch accounts).

2.7. On 4 September 2018, both experts filed a “Joint Statement” setting out where they agree
and disagree on the Horizon Issues. The areas of agreement were limited and high level
(e.g. they agree IT system changes have the potential to introduce bugs), in part because
the Claimants were still investigating many of the issues.

2.8 Post Office and Dr Worden will not therefore have a clear understanding of the Claimants’
case until Mr Coyne produces his full report to the Court, which is due on 16 October 2018.

2.9 Nevertheless, Dr Worden’s current view is that:
2.9.1 Horizon is a robust system;

2.9.2 There are a small number known bugs in Horizon but these either did not have
material impact on branches or were remedied.

2.9.3 Although we cannot eliminate the possibility of an undetected bug impacting a
postmaster, that risk within Horizon is very small and therefore immaterial.

2.10 Dr Worden’s current view is based on substantial investigative work. He cannot however
finalise his opinion until after he has considered Mr Coyne’s report.

B. Next Steps

2.11 Although the Horizon Issues trial will largely be based on disclosed documents and the
experts’ opinions, some witness evidence is required. Post Office therefore intends to file
four witness statements by the 28 September 2018 deadline:

2.11.1 two from Fujitsu personnel (concerning Horizon’s architecture, Core Audit Process,
“remote access”, and Fujitsu’ development and testing practices as audited); and

2.11.2 from Post Office personnel (concerning the Horizon functions available to help a
Postmaster identify branch account shortfalls, and how the Finance Service Centre
responds to challenges about branch accounts).

2.12 Mr Coyne’s Report is due to be filed on 16 October 2018. Assuming this is not extended
(e.g. as a consequence of the belated challenge received on 19 September 2018 referred to
above), any further evidence replying to specific content within Mr Coyne’s report will need
to be filed by 30 October 2018.

2.13 Dr Worden is due to file his report as Post Office’s expert on 30 November 2018.

2.14 The remaining steps as currently ordered by the Court are for any supplemental expert
reports to be exchanged by 18 January 2019, the experts to file a second Joint Statement

by 20 February 2019, and for a Pre Trial Review on 22 February 2019 to address any
outstanding issues before the scheduled start pf the Horizon Issues trial on 11 March 2019.

3. Contingency Planning

3.1 [[PLACE HOLDER]]

4. Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC)

4.1 The CCRC has advised POL that it is nearing completion of its reviews (commenced in 2015)
into 33 Post Office prosecutions of former postmasters (31 of whom are Claimants in the
Group Litigation).

4.2 However, given that the CCRC’s reviews touch on issues similar to those in the Postmaster
Litigation (in particular with respect to Horizon), delivery of the CCRC’s findings is likely to be
delayed by the litigation.

4.3 We continue to liaise with the CCRC, respond to its requests for information, and seek
information about the status of its investigations, mindful always of the need not to interfere
with the independence of the CCRC’s work.

5. Upcoming activity

5.1 The main activities between now and the next meeting on [[DATE]] will be:

5.1.1 Finalising preparations for the Common Issues trial, including addressing any issues
arising out of the updated Leading Counsels’ Merits Opinion (to be delivered on 28
September 2018), and resolving the admissibility/strike out application before or at
the 10 October 2018 hearing;

5.1.2  Finalising the witness evidence to be exchanged for the Horizon Issues trial, and
considering and responding to the Claimants’ experts report when filed on 16
October 2018;

5.1.3. [[Placeholder on Contingency Planning]];

5.1.4 Preparing for the meeting with the Permanent Secretary of BEIS and UKGI on 17
October 2018.
