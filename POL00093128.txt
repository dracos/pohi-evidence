Subject: COMPLAINT FROM TWO BALL LONNEN (3643298) REGARDING ADVICE GIVEN
WEEK 19 . .

Mick .
Further to our recent telephone conversation concerning the above .

It may you help to understand my concern if I explain that there is an ongoing dispute about
shortages at this office . Currently some £77K. of accumulated losses is being held in the office
suspense account and the nominee subpostmaster , Nigel Mills ,C is refusing to make these good
blaming the " Horizon " system as the cause of the shortages . The matter is now with our Legal
Services .

The issue concerns advice given by Post Office Helpline to the O.1.C Tracey Dowson on 1 August
when having discovered a surplus of £37,548.58 she sought help with the cash account for week
9 . I will quote from her report :-

"eee I spoke to Carl who was very helpful but still no answers , he said it was a ghost figure in the
system , I proceeded to roll the figures over as told and that Carl would contact myself on the ©
Thursday morning .

After the phone call he told me he had spoken to his Manager and that they were happy it would
show as a shortage the next week , the explanation given is that is was a ghost figure that had got
into the system but that they did not know how ."

Clearly remarks about "ghost figures in the system” attributable to our own staff are not likely to
inspire confidence in Horizon and in this case may prove very damaging . The nominee
subpostmaster has now written to ask for our comments on what was said and I in turn ask that
you give this your urgent attention and advise me of your findings as soon as possible .

Regards .
