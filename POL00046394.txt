Thanks

I will be in touch soon and arrange a new date. Can you get a letter of your solicitor stating that from the
proceeds of the sale, Post Office Ltd will be reimbursed with the money they are owed.

Regards to the sale of the business, we have agreed a sale with another party they are currently
going through HR.

With regards to the interview my solicitor is not available on the day of the 4th August so
another time needs to be arranged.

The letter of undertaking will be sent on to you.
Thank you

Khayyam.

Can you please update me on the current situation regarding the selling of your property and also have
you obtained the letter of undertaking from your solicitor stating that the money owed to Post Office Ltd
will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale.

Also can you attend a second interview? I have provisionally arranged the interview for Thursday 4
August 2011 at 11am. I have sent you a letter in the post and I will attach a copy to this e mail.

If the time and date is convenient can you please let me know either by return e mail or by post?

Thank You

Steve
