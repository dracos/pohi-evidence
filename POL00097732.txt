Thx really helpful.

It was a typical PO day! A combination of a couple of great highs (inc fab meeting with Argos - suggest you
speak to Paul B asap - he can update you)... Followed by tricky handling of colleagues and the Chairman
regarding James Arbuthnot MP and Second Sight (who managed to leave him with the impression that there is a
serious problem with Horizon, such that he has called an open meeting if MPs. Etc etc.)

Am going to send you a draft note I planned to send to you, Susan and Chris in case you have any thoughts -
like extending the Friday meeting to discuss? Let me know. (It's on the iPad, so no telling how long it will take -
iPad and train don't mix well!)

See you shortly, P

Hi Paula - looks like you had a nightmare day yesterday. If you have other things to do to prep
for the board, then leave this one. Alwen has allowed a bit if time in my agenda slot for Chris
and I to give an update and I can cover. I met the team yesterday with Kevin and so am up to
speed. See you later, Sue

To acknowledge receipt! You will see from the time ... that today did not go as
planned. So I shall assume your usual high quality and read on the way in
tomorrow.

Thank you.
