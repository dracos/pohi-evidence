Subject: RE: Meeting with JA tomorrow
Attachments: Agenda for JA meeting.pdf

Alice,

The agenda has gone over to James’ office as attached. Janet replied by return saying James would send over his own
agenda at some point today.

Ihave called Janet and tried to get her to slot James’ agenda into our framework on the basis of good administration and
to avoid two different agenda’s circulating.

Janet explained that there were much more detailed issues that James might wish to cover but that she could not go
into those yet as James had not signed them off and he had not had his call with Alan Bates which is scheduled for this
afternoon. She reiterated that it looked like close of play before the agenda would issue from their side. I pointed out
that this made it difficult for us to ensure we could respond fully to points of fine detail which she accepted and stated
that she thought James would be fine with sore areas being clarified after the meeting — she suggested by phone —I did
not get into the detail of it.

in terms of handling ahead of tomorrow I suggest we try and use our agenda tomorrow and slot his items into it and
agree this at the opening of the meeting with him.

Separately lan Henderson from Second Sight has been in touch with Chris Aujard to relay/give a heads up on his
conversation with James ahead of your meeting. I am writing up a short note for you on the points he raised now.

That’s fine for the pre-brief.

lam loath to leave the agenda in their hands so late in the day. If Paula is happy, David, would you please send across
the outline agenda (without the annotations) which you suggested for us, collapsing 2 and 4 into a single item? The
sooner the better.
