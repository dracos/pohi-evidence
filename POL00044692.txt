This case concerns an audit shortage of £27,811.98 discovered at the
Astwood Bank Post Office on the 11" September 2008 by Mr David Patrick,
Mr Kevin Watkins & Mrs Faith Lavender Post Office Ltd Auditors.

On arrival at the Post Office they introduced themselves to the Postmaster Mr
Julian Wilson and explained that they were there to conduct an audit on behalf
of Post Office Ltd. Mr Wilson allowed them access to the secure area and
immediately informed them that there would be a shortage in the cash of
around £27,000. He explained to them that it was due to an accumulation of
shortages he had experienced at the Post Office over the last 5 years or so.
He explained he had been inflating the cash on hand figures to show that the
office accounts would balance weekly and more recently on the monthly
Trading Period.

Upon confirmation of the shortage by the auditor the Postmaster was advised
that he was precautionary suspended on the authority of Mr Glen Chester Post
Office Contracts Manager pending further investigation. I was also contacted
at this time and I asked the auditors to obtain a signed statement confirming
these facts from the Postmaster and an Event Log Balancing printout from the
Horizon Computer System that covered the period 1*t August 2008 to 11
September 2008.

I spoke to Mr Wilson and informed him that I would need to conduct an
interview with him and explained to him his Legal Rights and the Post Office
Friend Rule. Mr Wilson advised me that he would be requiring both these
rights and he gave me the name and contact details of his Solicitor at Astwood
Law. He said he would also use his Post Office Federation Representative Mrs
Donna Evans as his Post Office Friend. It was at this point that I contacted a
Mr Graham Clarke and made arrangements for the interview to be conducted
at his offices of Astwood Law Solicitors on Monday 15" September 2008 at
14.30 hours.

I can now confirm that prior to the interview on the 11" September 2008, along
with my colleague Mr Graham Brander I attended the home address of Mr

“U and conducted a voluntary
search of both pi . n confirm that three entries were
made on the Search Record of the items seized and these items have
subsequently now been copied with the originals now returned to Mr Wilson.

The Post Office is located in a small urban area near Redditch, Birmingham.
Mr Wilson employed assistants at the Post Office.

Following the completion of the searches Mr Brander and I later made our way
to Astwood Law Solicitors Offices. Prior to commencement of the interview I

gave a disclosure to Mr Wilson’s Legal Representative Mr Clarke. It was at
this stage that we became aware that Mr Clarke was not a Solicitor who
specialised in Criminal Law but Mr Wilson confirmed that he was aware of this
fact but still wished Mr Clarke to represent him.

Prior to the interview I explained to Mr Wilson how the tape machine worked
and why two tapes were used. At 15.07 hours, along with Mr Brander I
commenced a tape-recorded interview with Mr Wilson in accordance with the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 Codes of Practice. Following the
general introductions Mr Wilson was cautioned and I completed the GS001at
15.08 hours. The GS003 Post Office Friend form was completed at 15.13
hours.

The interview comprised of two tapes, reference no’s 50313 and 50314 and
concluded at 16.33 hours. I have now prepared a summary of these tapes,
copies of which can be found at pages 5 to 25 of this file.

During the interview Mr Wilson did not admit to theft or misuse of the Post
Office money but did admit to False Accounting over the last 5 years due to
losses he had been experiencing. He was shown various Trading Statements
available to me from 11" April 2007 to 20" August 2008 and he confirmed that
they all showed false cash figures. Mr Wilson explained how this had been
common practice for the past 5 years or so. He was asked if he had
considered theft by his employees given the fact it appeared the shortages
were a regular occurrence with no explanation or corresponding errors ever
appearing apparent. He said he had not believed this to be the case.

The loss known to Post Office Ltd is £27,811.98, and I can confirm that this full
amount is still outstanding at this stage.

Mr Wilson explained how he would wish to repay the Post Office the full
amount of money missing but was not in a position to do so at that stage. He
informed me he would be looking to sell his business and he would then be in
a position to repay the Post Office at that point.

All original exhibits in this case are currently retained at my office in Poole.

Electronic copies of this report and the tape summaries have been sent to the
Post Office Ltd Casework Team along with the Legal report.

There did not appear to be any further failings in security, procedures or
product integrity that directly affect this case.
