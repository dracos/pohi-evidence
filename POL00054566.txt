Dear Ms Hogg

REC EEMA MIS!
GUILDFORD CROWN COURT - TRIAL

I refer you to our recent letter and still waiting to hear whether you have had the
‘opportunity to review the disk (Exhibit PT/02).

You are requesting hard copies and as you will appreciate this contains some 430,000
transactions going over a period of 13 months. I do not feel that this is a reasonable
request as to print this amount of data would probably run into thousands of pages. It
will be just as easy for the Defence to make hard copies of the disk and therefore you
can either print off all the transaction data yourself or print specific dates to assist with
your analysis.

Regards.

Yours sincerely

Jarnail Singh
Senior Lawyer
Criminal Law Division
