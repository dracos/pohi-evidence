identified and action is under way to resolve the differences.

Note:

¢ The Pathway plan reflects a Child Benefit only Model Office, Live Trial and

National Roll-out.

¢ No information on the Multi-Benefits activities have been included.

¢ The duration of Live Trial shows only 11 weeks and does not reflect the 17
week replan proposal. This impacts the NRO start date.

¢ Activities up to the end of Migration are (mostly) in line with our replan
but there are major variances post start of the Live Trial.

Input into CAPS Programme Board Report H

for Meeting on 18 September 1998 :
1 Introduction , Joe a?
This report summarises the state of the Horizon Programme as at August "oot
month end. i
I
2 Programme Overview ’

The major focus of the Programme at the current time continues to be: {

+ supporting the existing live systems fi

+ supporting the testing phase

+ progressing the ‘Programme Management’ content of the Replan with
respect to the Live Trial, multiple Benefits and the NR2+ Release.

+ clarifying the contractual implications and acceptance process arising
from the replan.

+ developing the Live Trial plans in detail.

+ developing the 1c to NR2 migration plans in more detail.

3 Live Operations
The current Release continues to provide a Benefit Payment Service and
Order Book Control System for Child Benefit Payments in 204 outlets
(119 in the South West & South Wales Region and 85 in the North East
Region).

From an operational point of view, there are no major threats to business
continuity.

Concern over the level of incomplete transactions (ITs) continues. These
have risen to 5.6 per 10,000 during July (from 4.0 in the previous month).
The main reason for this increase is due to a single category, BES/OBCS
Corruption (which represent 47% of all Incomplete Transactions)

Kee Operational workshops continue to be held to address this issue and the
resultant fixes for various categories of ITs have been placed in testing.
Evaluation and analysis of these fixes are imminent. If solutions prove
successful it is foreseen that categories of ITs and consequently volumes
will reduce dramatically - particularly those in the category mentioned
above. Forecast implementation of these solutions is 22 September (on
the assumption that testing is successful and passes acceptance by sponsor
organisations).

During July there were approximately 68,000 encashments (including
foreign encashments) with a total value in excess of £2m.

The Horizon Service Management Team continues to produce a monthly
Service Report which includes service performance reports and
: operational issues / threats. The latest report was-issued on 28 August
@ (BA/CAPS are included on distribution list).

5 ICL Pathway Release 2
5.1 q Statu:
Planning

Dialogue continues in order to resolve issues affecting.the Replan
particularly with regard to the Live Trial, the multiple Benefits
introduction and the release of NR2+. Agreement has been reached on the
structure and dates for MOR, MOT and F2E activities for release 2
(POCL and Child Benefit functionality). In addition, agreement has been
reached on the Ic to NR2 migration plans. including the Data Centres, and
the installation of the extra 100 offices. Work is now necessary to develop
the detailed aspects of this plan and Pathway have been invited to
commence work in this area. Meetings with BA arranged for 9
September.

Testing
JSA MOT third cycle is progressing well and is due to complete on
schedule mid September in time to feed into (Horizon) MOR2 .

MORI completed satisfactorily on 26 August 1998. Overall impressions

of the counter service from the users (trained counter staff) and the

Horizon Test Team have been that the counter is working well: that it is

useable and resilient, that it performs with speed and that the error and :
exception handling messages/functions are present. The majority of

current problems are considered to be of minor importance and are

expected to be fixed for MOR2 which is planned to start on 14 September.

The MORI phase has been successful. Pathway have been able to prove
their live architecture. in particular the data centre and its migration, the
network and communications, and the connectivity between the counter
and the data.

E2E progress is slow but steady. The E2E cycle is being run in a more
deliberate manner than MO, allowing serious errors to be fixed before
progressing. The expectation is that most of the first cycle will be
completed by the target date. At this stage it is too early to predict whether
there will be an impact on the final end date of 18 December. The latest
position on testing will be presented by the Horizon Programme Director
to the CAPS Board at the meeting on 18 September.

Acceptance

During the period, management of the acceptance team was further
strengthened with the recruitment of an Incident Manager and a Process
Manager. Further recruitment continues to bring the team up to full
strength. A review of the support tools has completed and additional
hardware has been ordered. *

The acceptance framework, which provides a business top-down view has
now been developed and is being used to provide a review of the
adequacy of the acceptance approacli. A gap analysis continues and will
be completed by the first week in September. This will be followed by

further analysis to determine whether the identified gaps can be filled by
other parts of the contract or whether they are true omissions.

The Acceptance Preparation Stage is continuing with the review and ‘
agreement of the acceptance specifications. ICL Pathway’s target for all

specs to be completed and signed-off by mid-August was not met and the

implications are being assessed. All 23 acceptance specifications have

now been received from ICL Pathway and reviews continue. There are

still a number of problems in this area and additional efforts are now being

brought to bear to improve the overall situation:

Formal management forums are in the process of being established for
acceptance. Draft Terms of Reference for the Acceptance Managers’
Forum have been completed and invitations to members will be issued
toward the end of August.

Implementation

General

The Implementation Risk Register has undergone a complete review with
the second iteration, including updates on mitigating action, issued 1
August.

The Horizon Implementation Board met on 11 August and will continue
to meet on a monthly basis to co-ordinate progress and address issues.

Installation

An updated Installation Strategy is expected from ICL Pathway for POCL
sign off by 21 August. A signed off copy of the Survey Requirements has
been received from ICL Pathway (excluding Flat Screens). A revised
Survey Document retlecting the Flat Screen option has been received and
is under review.

Training
Model Office training and training of Survey Support Managers has been
completed.

Migration

A draft plan and draft interim procedures for implementation of NR2 in
Release Ic outlets have been produced. ‘The Outlet Migration Strategy is
being redrafted by ICL Pathway taking into account recent developments
in the ECCO migration process. Discussions are underway with ICL
Pathway to obtain their sign-off of the migration tool functional
specification. Interim tools were used in MORI, and some difficulties

were experienced. Revised migration software tools will be ready for use
in MOR2.

Live Trial

Work continues to draw together the details based on the Horizon replan
which proposes a 17 week Live Trial. The justification for the 17 week
period has been presented to Pathway though this has not yet been
formally accepted by them given the wider contractual issues.

or

5.2

National Rollout

A meeting between Pathway and POCL increased the joint understanding
regarding the trigger points for starting rollout and the currently agreed
ramp up volumes. Further work is necessary to develop this and to link

with the Live Trial plans.

issues / Risks

The following areas of concern have been identified as possible obstacles
to the delivery of Release 2. These issues are being actively managed

within the Programme.

Issue

Action

End to End/Model Office Testing
While the first cycle of Model
Office completed ahead of
schedule, some problems have been
encountered in End to End testing
which may pose a risk to achieving
the 18 December completion date.

A number of actions are being
evaluated to improve the likelihood
of completion to schedule. Some
contingency time is also available
in January should it prove
neccesary.

BES/PAS Boundary

Agreement on this boundary is
necessary for establishing liabilities
in the live environment.

Action is with POCL Finance
Director who is reviewing the
position. Horizon Programme
Director continues to liaise with
Finance Director to provide input as
required.

BES Fallback

Additional mechanisms are
required to ensure the final
reconciliation of BES and EPOSS
transactions when a communication
line failure occurs.

Pathway are implementing an
agreed solution.

Acceptance Specifications

Some specifications are incomplete
due to unavailability of some cited

evidence and inadequate coverage.

This also impacts the clarity of the

plans for acceptance execution.

Continuing work with Pathway to
support the process of completing
the specifications and improving
their quality. DSS comments
outstanding on the DSS interface
specification.

Future Releases
Release 2+

The issue resolution process is continuing. For soft EVP the action is with
POCL to follow up the proposal from Pathway. There are no outstanding
technical issues concerning on-line enquiries though the issue around the
required delivery date is being progressed.

Pathways Release Contents Definition was received on 27 August and
distributed for comment.

Normal Working Hours Support

During Normal Working Hours, the support route will operate as the Live Operational

Service. All application, operational and infrastructure calls will be raised on the:

HSHD and Payment/Card/Pun related calls will be raised on the Payment Card

Helpline. (NOTE - Girobank are not providing the Payment Card Helpline facility for

E2E testing. )

The 2", 3rd and 4" Jine support routes will operate in a similar way to the Live ‘
Operational Service. The only amendment is that 3" line will pass calls to PIAT rather

than direct to development. If PIAT decide a fix is required they will pass the call to

Release Management to authorise the fix. Once the fix is authorised Release
Management will forward the call to development. See Appendix 4.

The expertise and knowledge of the Pathway T&I team may be used to aid in the :
support process during the MO period.

When a call reaches 3 line the call type will be amended to:

N- for MORI and MOR2
M- for MOT
E- for E2E

For full details of phone numbers and operational hours see Appendix 2.

Out Of Hours Support Routes

During Out Of Hours minimal HTT testing is planned. Any problem occurring out of
hours should be in the area of file transfer of data to and from the MO Data Centre,
transfer of data to or from the MO Counter Environment or problems to do with the
operation of the system.

The Support Route during these times is direct from Outsourcing Operations to 3rd
line support and the E2E or MO Manager. 3% line will call in whomever they deem
appropriate. The E2E or MO Manager is called in case there may be a delay to the
plan or authorisation is required to perform any data changes.

Call Logging

All issues requiring ICL Pathways attention must be logged via the HSHD.
For calls from HTT the FAD code of the relevant post office should be sufficient.
For calls raised by other areas involved in testing the following codes should be used:

PAT900 for MO
PAT901 for E2E

The HSHD call logger must ensure the text of the call includes a statement detailing
whether it is a MO or an E2E call.

Without Prejudice and Subject to Contract

1. Management Summary

4.4 Introduction

This document summarises and extracts the key planning information from the formally presented Horizon Replan Summary. The Replan has
been agréed by both Sponsors (POCL and Benefits Agency). ICL Pathway have agreed to work to the. plan while commercial negotiations are in
process. This summary is produced to support clear and consistent communication of the Replan within POCL and the Horizon Team, but copies
will also be provided to the Benefits Agency and Pathway. .

The Replan covers:
the new POCL infrastructure and services (including BES, EPOSS, and APS) together with card payment facilities on behalf of the Benefits
Agency (PAS and CMS) - these are referred to collectively as the ‘NR2’ release
supplementary facilities which are necessary to complete the contracted requirements and enable a _network-wide rollout (the ‘NR2+’
- release).
It also addresses the required interfaces with the Benefits Agency systems through an agreed plan with their CAPS Programme.

The focus of the Replan has been on the programme approach and timetable for the delivery and implementation of the new services. The Replan
will require the support of the Treasury Review and agreed changes to the contract and to the acceptance process. For the,time being all parties
are Working to the approach. Regular updates to this document will be issued to reflect developments.

41.2 Benefits of Proposed Approach ws 8

The Horizon Programme has proposed a fresh approach in this Replan which to a significant extent ‘decouples’ the Horizon and CAPS activities.
In principle it provides a two stage approach whereby the rollout of POCL infrastructure and services will commence initially with Child Benefit
card payments only, followed in the second stage by the rollout of the card payment service for multiple benefits. By separating the two aspects
of rollout (ie the ‘rollout of post offices’ from the ‘rollout of benefit card payments’), this approach will give. the management within the
Sponsoring organisations more flexibility to manage their individual responsibilities while minimising constraints upon each other.

Summary of Plans Page 2 of S 2™ September 1998

POL00028100
POL00028100

© e ; eu.

Without Prejudice and “Subject to Contract 2

In summary therefore the decouple approach will: *

« reduce the complexity of the joint management and integration of activities

« provide the earliest achievable date for Pathway to rollout services to the POCL offices, with an estimated date of 5" July 1999.

support the CAPS work programme for integration of the Feeder Benefit Systems

* build on the proven experience of Child Benefit card payments, and follow this by the rapid rollout of the ‘multi-benefit’ service as soon as it
is proven

« enable a staged acceptance of the Pathway service, with full contractual acceptance, to include the delivery of NR2+, in February 2000.

1.3 Plan Summary

A high level presentation of the plan is shown in Appendix 1. This is taken from the agreed Replan Proposal. There are two main stages:
¢ POCL Services/Child Benefit .
¢, Multi-benefit Stage (to include JSA, IS and Pensions)

The dates provided are based on the Sponsor’s current best view but will be subject to the agreement of detailed plans.
4.3.1 Stage 1 -POCL Services/Child Benefit

This, stage results in the commencement of rollout of the POCL infrastructure and services in July 1999 together with the support of Child
Benefit payments in every office as it goes live on Horizon. The main steps in this stage are as follows:

Pathway delivery of NR2 into Model Office 3" August 1998

Model Office testing 3™ August to 18" December 1998

Start joint Model Office testing with CAPS From 14" September 1998

End-to-End testing 3" August to 18" December 1998

Start Migration of the 204 ‘1c’ offices to NR2 * 4th January 1999

Start POCL Live Trial (child benefit) 8th February 1999

Complete POCL Live Trial (child benefit) 4" June 1999

Contingency period for testing and Trial (4 weeks) Up to 2" July 1999

Start POCL/Child Benefit rollout . By 5" July 1999 =

Given the scale and scope of the processes which need to be proven in Model Office and End-to-End testing the plan seeks to provide a
‘contingency window’ at the end of these stages. If they complete satisfactorily by 18" December, with Release Authorisation by Christmas, then
the Migration step can proceed on 4" January. However a contingency provision is made for testing to continue until 11" January if necessary,
with Release Authorisation by 15th January. This would result in Migration starting on 18" January. The POCL Live Trial, which follows 5
weeks after the start of migration, is scheduled to start therefore on 8" February, or 22" February if the contingency is required . A decision on
whether this contingency window is needed will be made by the end of October 1998 when the rate of progress on testing will be clear.

The Live Trial is scheduled for 17 weeks finishing on 4" June 1999. The earliest date to start the post office rollout would therefore be 7* June
1999. However the testing contingency of 2 weeks discussed above may be necessary and a further 2 week contingency period is provided at the
end of the Live Trial. This gives a rollout start date of 5" July 1999. If neither the testing contingency nor the POCL Live Trial contingency are
required then rollout can commence at the earlier date of 7" June 1999. A decision on this earlier start for POCL office rollout will need to be
taken at the latest by 1* April 1999. This date will allow sufficient evidence to be assessed from the Live Trial while giving at least 8 weeks to
manage the lead in to the post office rollout. The Benefits Agency card rollout could be brought forward to the 7" June 1999 only if notice is
given by the end of October 1998. Otherwise the planned date for card rollout will remain as the 5* July 1999. On the other hand unforeseen
problems, whether of a business or technical nature, could be found in the Trial (which is the reason for undertaking it). Through careful
monitoring and timely action the Programme will however strive to ensure the rollout does commence by Sth July 1999.

1.3.2 Stage 2 - Multi-Benefit Stage

The Multi-benefit service will run on the same NR2 software platform as the Child Benefit release but will utilise-the more complex processing
associated with, for example, urgent stops and payments. It will also require integration with the three additional Feeder Benefit Systems for
JSA, IS and Pensions,

The Multi-benefit stage therefore begins with a ‘pre-proving? testing activity prior to entry to the full Model Office environment in order to give
initial confidence that these transaction types can be correctly processed. This work will commence from 1* December 1998.

The main steps in Stage 2 are as follows:

Pre-proving tests December 1998 to March 1999

Without Prejudice and Subject to Contract

Joint Model Office 12" April to 1" October 1999
Multi-benefit Trial starts 13" September 1999

All benefits into Trial By end November 1999 ”
Full acceptance of NR2 February 2000

Multi-benefit card rollout starts From 28" February 2000

By February 2000 several thousand offices will already have been rolled out from Stage 1 and there will be an existing base to which cards can
be deployed. Card deployment for JSA, IS and Pensions can therefore take place as quickly as practical to their offices, subject to maintenance of
an acceptable level of service. It will then follow the continuous office rollout .

The Related Agreements with Pathway also includes delivery of the NR2+ software release. This will provide additional functionality to support
a network wide deployment (notably On-Line Enquiries and Soft EVP - Extended Verification Procedures) as well as additional POCL services
such as AP Smart. The final design of NR2+ functionality is currently being completed which will be followed by a formal development plan to
be agreed by all parties. Based on discussions to date with Pathway, the Sponsors believe that it is reasonable to expect that NR2+ could be
delivered into joint sponsor acceptance testing from 1" October 1999. This would be advantageous in that the acceptance processes for Multi-
benefit and NR2+ could be run concurrently to complete in February 2000. Confirmed NR2+ development and testing and deployment dates do
however need to be established by more detailed planning and with the agreement of all parties.

1.4 Summary Plans

Appendix 1 shows the representation of the high level Replan which was included in the Replan Proposal. eh

Appendix 2 shows the formal Level 0 Plan for the Programme showing the key dates established in the Replan process. Changes to the Level 0
Plan are the responsibility of the Horizon Release Management Team who will agree them with the other parties.

The Level 0 Plan will be supported by more detailed Level 1 and 2 plans, covering the various areas within Horizon, Pathway and the Benefits
Agency. These plans will be co-ordinated and consolidated by the Horizon Programme Office.

L MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The execution of the DIT 2 script was completed on the 8* July 1998 with all output files being
accepted by each of the parties involved. Therefore, although some faults have been found and have
yet to be cleared, all parties agreed that DIT had completed on that date.

All the DIT testing objectives have been met although for various reasons, not all as a direct result‘of
DIT, the End2End 1* pass objectives have not been entirely satisfied. In particular the End2End 1*
Pass objective that was not met is with regard to the proving of the Pathway End2End environment.
The reasons for this are given in Section 4.2. os

This means that there are some minor risks carried over to the End2End 2 Pass that would have been
expected to be resolved in a full 1* Pass. . ‘

LL Summary

In summary, the findings of the DIT phase are as follows:

= The Horizon Application was, by the commencement of the second attempt at DIT 2, stable and
capable of supporting the parallel DIT activity. There are a number of system faults that have been
discovered and Pathway are attempting to clear these prior to the commencement of End2End and
MOT. These are detailed in this document in Appendix B — Outstanding PINICLS.

- The Design. Although the interfaces operated to the agreed specifications, a number of issues have
either been raised concerning the design itself or were known to be issues with the agreed
specification at the time of commencing DIT testing. Some of these are currently the subject of
proposed design changes or discussions that may result in same. These are being progressed in
other areas of the programme and are discussed elsewhere in this document (See Section 4.3).
However they are only of concem to DIT 2 in that they may undermine the testing that has taken
place by altering the underlying design baseline.

= Test Preparation was complicated by the need to ensure the compatibility of the individual
interface tests and the parallel activity to take place in DIT 2. This meant a “date/data alignment”
exercise to validate the dates and data (as supported by the common reference data), which
inevitably led to a number of complications in both the derivation and the agreement of the test
scripts - particularly the joint script that was required for DIT 2.

There were also a number of problems with the setting up of the DIT 2 environment prior to the
second attempt at running it, which are highlighted in Section 6.1.

1.2, Conclusion

While a number of problems were experienced with the system during DIT, the majority of these have
now been fixed and re-tested, or are in the process of being fixed prior to commencing MOT and
End2End, Therefore, this report concludes that it is safe to commence the End2End and MOR
activities, although the de-stabilising effect of any design changes should be closely guarded against.

. "These have now been accepted by the MOT and End2End managers and are being managed as part of

Horizon Programme DIT Closure Report for New Release 2

2. INTRODUCTION
2.1. Document Purpose

This document summarises the objectives of DIT and describes the approach taken during DIT. It also
provides a presentation of results following completion of the DIT test phase and provides a method
for agreeing between all participants the closing status.

22. DIT Testing Objectives

The objective of Direct Interface Testing can be described as follows:

To ensure that each of the interfaces, between the key primary systems/organisations and
Pathway, are operating to specification and in a stable and predictable fashion.

It is not intended as a system test of the internal/business functionality of any of the involved systems.
That is an activity that should be run independently of the interface test by each of the systems
involved.

Clearly the focus is on the ability to correctly transfer data in the formats and structures expected by
the systems receiving the data. The data is passed through the external facing validation components of
those systems to validate this and testing is conducted using links that are as close to live
configurations as possible.

However, in line with the approach agreed in Reference A to fulfil the objectives of End2End 1* Pass
during DIT2, the DIT environment is to be adopted for use by End2End testing and the following
additional objective was added to DIT2:

To commission the environments, including the links between them, to ensure their readiness
for End2End.

The following diagram shows the interfaces in question. Note that there is a secondary interface
between TIP and Reference Data, which was also tested within DIT, as this provides evidence of the
ability to keep the Reference Data of both TIP and Pathway in step with each other.

Reference TIP
Data “>I
Na th Hi
Pathway APS
OBCS CAPS

During the preparation for DIT2 the decision was taken to ensure that a reasonable degree of integrity
exists in cash accounting — this being one of the central focuses of attention of the End2End phase.
This required a level of functional stability that would otherwise not be required during DIT.

1 Stream Per Interface Parallel Running

3.1.1. DITI

The DIT I activity was completed without the benefit of a fully integrated Pathway product. It was run
‘on two Pathway test rigs, each operating with a subset of the interfaces and the underlying
functionality. This was carried out in parallel with the Pathway BIT testing before deployment ofan
integrated product onto a single rig for DIT 2. The following diagram shows the split between the two
DIT rigs:

Reference I_ TIP
Data

The DIT I test phase also provided the opportunity for extensive negative testing to take place for each
of the interfaces. This was testing of failure conditions, some of which needed to be simulated to
represent the appropriate circumstances of the failure. These were, in the main, not carried through to

the DIT 2 test as this would have caused too much disruption to the overall execution of that parallel
run,

One of the consequences of this split in both functionality and physical rig was that it was not possible,
within DIT 1, for the TIP interface to be proven with the transactions that were generated from the
HAPS, CAPS and OBCS supporting functionality.

This would have meant that the interface was only partially tested prior to DIT 2. In order to
circumvent this problem, Pathway furnished TIP with evidence of BIT test activity.

3.1.2. DIT2

Prior to DIT 2 commencing, a script was produced from the underlying DIT I scripts that represented a
period of execution that would be triggered by, and triggers, data across each of the interfaces.
Although this was an opportunity for each of the systems to test their individual interfaces again, it
became apparent that the test phase was very much for the benefit of TIP and Pathway for the
following reasons:

© Each of the other systems were generally satisfied with the level of testing already carried
out. This was particularly true of CAPS who, despite having a couple of minor negative
tests to complete at some stage, felt that the interface hiad been appropriately exercised by
the end of DIT I.

* Pathway would be given the opportunity to exercise the integrated product to ensure that
the interfaces still worked correctly when run in combination.

© TIP had largely only had simulations of data for the areas of the system not shared on
their DIT rig. The DIT 2 script enabled them to receive data combinations of differing
types and sources that had not been possible during DIT 1.

For the TIP interface to be proven to the satisfaction of TIP (taking into account their detailed scripting

of expected results), and in accordance with objectives to operate DIT 2 asa 1" Pass for End2End, the

Cash Accounting functionality had to show a “reasonable” degree of integrity. Although this ventured

into the areas of functional proving it was decided that this was a valid pre-requisite and in a meeting -
held on 30 April it was formally agreed that the cash accounting must demonstrate this integrity prior

to commencement of (and for the duration of) DIT 2.

3.1.3, Extended Interface Testing (EIT)

During the course of DIT there were requests from cach of the participants for tests that were not
strictly within the scope of DIT, or could wait until End2End, but that made sense to be
accommodated, if possible. Rather than expand the scope of DIT and detract from the primary
objectives. These tests were provided at quicter moments in the testing schedule, These were also
sometimes referred to as “supplementary tests”.

3.2. Participants

The testing teams responsible for each of the systems involved liaised with the Pathway test team/s to
ensure that their test requirements within the scope of DIT were included within the test phase. They
also provided test data where appropriate in support of their own tests and those that were required to
generate the necessary outputs for other systems ¢.g. TIP.

‘The testing teams of each system were responsible for checking the data received by them for
completeness and accuracy and notifying Pathway where discrepancies rose. These were then
investigated and an agreed explanation or resolution put in place.

Each testing team also provided representation and verbal or written progress reports through the
weekly DIT Co-ordination meeting and any such other ad-hoc mecting that was deemed necessary
during the test phase.

2.1. ICL Pathway

ICL Pathway, through the authority of the DIT Manager, was responsible for the final say on any
decisions regarding scope and timing of each of the DIT test phases. Where possible this was done
with the understanding and full agreement of all parties.

3.2.2. Horizon Testing

‘There was no direct Horizon testing involvement apart from the DIT Co-ordinator's role. The DIT Co-
ordinator ran a weekly co-ordination meeting where progress and issues were recorded. These were
formally minuted, circulated to all attendees and agreed. These are available for inspection in either
electronic or paper from the DIT Co-ordinator. .

33. Test Scripts

Individual scripts were agreed for DIT 1 between ICL Pathway and each of the parties.

Reference data produced one script for each of the drops of data that they provided. As the reference
data drops were incremental these were issued and agreed with the release of each drop of data.

AtDIT 2a joint script (version 11) was agreed between all parties. This version was shorter than
previous versions, having been reduced from 38 days to 17. This reduction centred on the removal of
differing lengths of accounting periods. The DIT Manager took this decision on the basis that the
length of the accounting periods has no specific effect on the Horizon solution and therefore is not
pertinent to DIT. ue

3.3.1. Timing

ity proceeded approximately to plan - the underlying plan being the subject ofa
is over the period.

An initial attempt at DIT 2, starting on 20" April, was unsuccessful and it was agreed after one week
that the Pathway integrated product was not at the standard required to continue. There was then a
pause, allowing some EIT work to'take place and for the Pathway System Test and BIT test phases to
make more progress. During this time Pathway provided evidence of the progress being made,
particularly in the area of cash accounting. A fresh start commenced on 16% June.

4, TESTING COVERAGE
4. Exclusions/Shortfalls

The following areas were either not covered to the satisfaction of all parties during DIT, or were
specifically excluded from the DIT scope. They are therefore risks carried over into later test phases:

© The testing of extended accounting periods was excluded from the test script for DIT 2.
This specific functionality will therefore first be covered by End2End and is considered
by Pathway to be low risk -

«No BES Card based (swiped) transactions were carried out. All card activations and -
encashments were manually processed. Pathway gave assurances that this specific
functionality has been tested elsewhere and therefore, in their opinion, the risk of this
omission in minimal.

«Migration.

* Any acknowledged gaps in the interface design/s, as noted in the agreed interface
specifications were specifically excluded from DIT. In particular the handling of BES
exceptions in the TIP reconciliation process.

4.2, End 2 End 1" Pass weaknesses
4.2.1. Reference Data Proving

On top of the problems with the configuration management of the reference data mentioned in Section
6.1.1 the approach to the provision of the End2End reference data changed during the period of the
DIT 2 execution.

‘The original intention was that the DIT reference data would be used for End2End. It has now been
decided that the End2End data is to be constructed from live reference data, in the same way as the
MOT data, ageing it appropriately to match the run dates agreed for End2End.

It was not an objective of DIT to test the capability of TIP & Pathway to take incremental reference
data drops & keep in step with each other. This will be tested elsewhere.

Consequently the reference data has not been pre-proven for End2End by DIT.
4.2.2. Migration

As migration is currently planned as the opening activity in the End2End High Level Test plan the
Pathway test environment will be partially, if not fully, re-configured for the purposes of the migration
test. There is a risk associated with this break in continuity that the environment proving will be
undermined.

4.3. Design Stability

A number of changes are currently under consideration, which may affect the interfaces in the future.
‘These are as follows:

© Changes are being discussed to further automate the Reference Data interface,
particularly the transmission of Class B data e.g. cash-account mappings and Methods of
Payment. This is being monitored through the Reference Data Checkpoint meeting,
chaired by Product Assurance and attended by Horizon, Pathway and POCL Reference
Data. The current understanding is that this will not be in New Release 2 and is therefore
not currently a risk to the stability of the design during this release.

* Enhanced error handling across the HAPS interface to improve the handling of file
rejections. The current understanding is that this will also not be in New Release 2 and is
therefore not currently a risk to the stability of the design during this release,

“Horizon Programme ” DIT Closure Report for New Release 2

PinICL 8881 (see Appendix B) has been raised regarding an apparent discrepancy
between Reference Data and Pathway in the way they identify clients and how Pathway
relate this in respect of the HAP interface. This is being monitored by Product Assurance
as noted in the minutes of the I* Reference Data Checkpoint Meeting held on 30* June.

BES Exception processing. This is a known deficiency in the design to mect the agreed
TIP interface specification. This is currently being discussed between the TIP project and
ICL Pathway to establish and agree a solution.

‘The design solution to support discrepancies between cash accounting periods is still
evolving.

‘The design of the directory structure on the Reference Data gateway PC has still not been
resolved. This means that the transfer of data between the Reference Data Project and
Pathway may not have been conducted during DIT2 in exactly the same environment as
that intended for live.

‘The position at the end of DIT2 and prior to entry to MOT and End2End is as follows:
5.1. Incidents raised during DIT 2.
During the course of DIT2 a total of 63 incidents were raised by TIP? and passed to Pathway for
investigation.
These consisted of:
* 14 due to execution or data preparation errors

A break down of the various PinICLs still outstanding at the end of DIT 2 is provided in Appendix B.

‘The outstanding faults, which are not planned to be corrected prior to End2End/MOT, are not an
impediment to starting these test phases*.

2 A handful of incidents were raised by HAPS with no significant error being identified. I

6. OBSERVATIONS & PROBLEMS
6.1. Test Preparation
6.1.1, Reference Data Configuration

During the setting up of the DIT 2 test rig at Pathway the reference data baseline (DROP 1), agreed by
all parties, was loaded over the top of the development reference data set. This situation was identified
by Pathway and resolved, causing only a minor delay to the execution of DIT2.

However, the Pathway DIT reference data set was shared with other test and development users and~
changes requested by them were percolated into the DIT 2 testing environment.

This resulted in some testing discrepancies where the Pathway and TIP reference datasets becameout +
of step.

6.1.2. BES Cards
No cards were available to match the test data being used for DIT 2. Consequently all card transactions
were carried out manually and no “swipe” of the cards was completed. Ultimately this resulted in

discrepancies between the actual and expected results, from a TIP perspective, and highlighted a
difference in the interpretation of the script.

6.2. HAPS Client Cards

Early on in the DIT phase, cards were not readily available for all the clients agreed to be used in the
script. This situation was resolved by Pathway for the final run of DIT2.

6.2.1. Errors in Payment Authorizations

During DIT 1, where specific payments were scripted but multiple authorisations existed on the system

for the clients, the unwanted authorisations were stopped so that the encashments could proceed as
planned. This was an awkward practice.

Prior to DIT 2.a decision was taken to construct the payment authorisations within the Pathway test
team. This was accepted at the time as a potentially risky decision. Unfortunately the construction
process was not error free and a number of problems were encountered regarding payment amounts. I

It should be noted that risk associated with the adopted approach was understood and agreed by all
parties prior to the commencement of the final run of DIT2.

6.3. Testing Execution Errors : a
Some testing execution errors were encountered during DIT2. These were partly caused by some of the
test preparation problems described above.

Due to its closely scripted nature, the amount of work that execution errors could generate in End2End
could be unacceptable and should be avoided.

7. LESSONS LEARNT
7A. Readiness to start

Due to the pressures on the programme to meet planned dates, the first attempt at DIT 2 proceeded
when the state of the system was not at the appropriate standard. Although the pressures are understood
the time spent on this early attempt was generally accepted to be an inefficient use of available
resources. This situation should be avoided in future.

Every attempt was made, through the close monitoring of the entry criteria, to ensure that the second
attempt did not start prematurely. This approach proved to be successful.

7.2. Date and Data alignment

The effects and the implications of aligning the data and dates between the different interfaces were not
clearly understood from the outsct of DIT and the effects were not always clear.

‘This was due to the split between the bilateral testing in DIT1 and the multilateral testing in DIT2 and
the difference between the narrow and broader views that this required. It was also due to the late
realisation of the emphasis on TIP requirements for DIT2.

Having been through this exercise this should be a cleaner and easier exercise in future. It is also not
thought to be a problem that will be encountered during End2End, as the emphasis during the
preparation for End2End has consistently been on the wider testing requirements of all participating
parties.

73. DIT 2/End2End 1" Pass

Having attempted to use the DIT test as a method of proving/commissioning the End2End test
environment, it appears that this has had two effects. These are:

© Ithas blurred the edges between the technical and functional objectives of the DIT 2
phase. This had an effect on the scope and certainly caused differences of opinion in the
agreement of that scope. One consequence was the introduction of the cash account
integrity as a pre-requisite for DIT2, which in its own right would arguably have been
excluded from DIT but for inclusion of the End2End 1* pass objectives.

© It confused the dependencies between these two tasks. The DIT activity had to be
completed prior to End2End even though the DIT preparation and planning was reliant on
key assumptions for End2End, such as run dates and core test data. In the end some of
these dependencies disappeared c.g. the approach to the provision of reference data
changed during course of DIT, effectively removing some of the dependency on
reference data being synchronised between these two test phases.

‘The benefits of attempting to combine two test phases with separate objectives must be clearly
balanced against the costs and risks associated with doing so. Where possible the savings from any
overlapping activity/objectives should be recognised by perhaps shortening the two test phases - whilst
retaining their independence, rather than combing them.

7A, Pre-requisite of an integrated environment

It was not obvious to all concerned until well into the testing that it would not be possible to transfer all
types of data across the TIP interface until the fully integrated version of the system was available.
Because of the nature and size of future release this is unlikely to occur in the future but should be bom
in mind when assessing the dependencies of the interface testing with other test phases.

15. Reference Data Integrity
When the integrity of reference data between TIP, Pathway and Reference Data is required, it is

essential that the reference data is secure in each of the,three areas from other test phases. This was not
the case for DIT 2 and TIP and Pathway became out of step.

VERSION 5.0
BASELINE DATE: 11°" SEPTEMBER 1998

RELEASE NOTES: for General Distribution.

All the dates contained within this plan (ref: PM/PLA/031) are based on a Child Benefit only
Model Office, Live Trial and start of National Roll Out. No information on the Multi-
Benefit activities have been included, as this information is currently held by the Horizon
team.

The start date and duration of the Live Trial has yet to be agreed, as such version 5.0 of the
Release 2 plan maintains the 11 wk duration of version 4.0 but starting on the 1 February
1999, rather than. 2st January 1999.

No reference has been made to New Release2+.

This version of the New Release2 High Level Plan takes into consideration the following
changes:

¢ Approved modifications to the Model Office Waterfall, to include Model Office
Rehearsal #3 and better use of the in-built contingency.

¢ _ Re-alignment of the remaining System Test Main Passes to take account of the final
functional drop of BPS Reconciliation and PinICL, fixes.

¢ Re-alignment of System Test Final Passes to meet test rig availability.

Re work of other areas of the testing plan to come into line with System Test and Model

Office. .

Replan work on Technical / Performance and Security testing.

Inclusion of activities to represent the EPOSS Usability Study

Additional activities for Acceptance.(System Test Final Passes)

Dates for Live Trial, post 1° February 1999, still awaiting agreement.

Inclusion of Milestones for the Release Authorisation Process from a presentation given

at last weeks Check Point Meeting. The approach is still to be ratified with Steve

Muchow and amendments will be made as appropriate.

© The Customer Education plan is still “No Forecast” awaiting the resolution of the Live
Trial Plan.

© Additional activities for Customer Service and Reference Data.

To: John Meagher From: Paul Wootton
Horizon COBAP

Date: 14 September 1998

cc: BA Acceptance WG

Ken Davenport
Issue: Acceptance Issues
Action: To confirm agreement and update on progress
Timing: By cop Wednesday 16 September 1998 to enable briefing to Peter Crahan

prior to CAPS and Card Programme Board

2: When we met on 4 September, we alluded to the Acceptance issues BA identified to you in early August

1998, and discussed the Acceptance implications of the replan.
2. This minute seeks to:

2.1 Clarify BA’s approach to replan Stage 1 (Acceptance v Release Authorisation)

2.2 Wdentify additional issues arising from the replan and seek acknowledgement that you accept

these as issues to be resolved.

23 Review the identified issues, suggest methods of approaching some of the outstanding Issues,

and to seek an Horizon progress report

24 Raise additional issues which need to be addressed., seek confirmation that they are accepted,

and obtain information on how Horizon is dealing (will deal) with them.

Replan - Acceptance v Release Authorisation

2. In discussing the replan, I explained to you on 4 September the then BA perspective that Stage 1 appeared
to be @ Release Authorisation rather than @ contractual Acceptance. I have since obtained a copy of the
feplan documents and discussed within BA and with Pat Kelsey. I now concur with your position that
Stage 1 constitutes part of the Acceptance process, as I explained in the phone message I left with Rod

Stocker on Monday last.
Replan Acceptance Issues
3. Having had the opportunity to look at the replan proposals in more detail, several issues emerge, which

have been aired at the BA Acceptance Working Group:

P02

POL00028100
POL00028100 _

17 SEP °98 10:23 FROM BA-POCL PDA FELTHAM P.@3/18

34 We need an overall integrated plan for the whole of the Acceptance process. This was alluded to
at our meeting, and we discussed in more detail with Ian Kerr later. (1 have also written to Rod
Stocker to suggest that his recent paper on Release Authorisation should specifically refer 10 the
Contractual Acceptance process, and that Release plans should specifically acknowledge
Acceptance work steps - Rod tells me he has no problem with this)

52 The present Acceptance Specifications are NR2 specific but do not distinguish between NR2
Stage 1 and NR2 Stage 2.

3.3. We are not aware of a definition of a Proof of Concept for Mobile Configuration, (required for
Stage 1 Acceptance). If it does not exist, it will need to be developed and, in any event, brokered
between the parties. It is not clear where the responsibility lies for defming it, nor how it will be
factored in.

34 Criteria for success in nuulti-benefit testing (Required for Stage 1 Acceptance) needs to be
defined and brokered between the parties. It is not clear where the responsibility lies for defining
them, nor how they will be factored into the Acceptance process.

35 Criteria for adequate progress in NR2+ development (Required for Stage 1 Acceptance) nced to
be defined and brokered between the parties. It is not clear where the responsibility lies for
defining it, nor how they will be factored into the Acceptance process,, [Note that to move this
along, I propose that the Criteria will be that the Authorities have seen and agreed:

1. NR2+ SADD

2.NR2+ RCD

3. NR2+ Acceptance Specification,
and

4, Logical design is complete
S. Code is 100 % complete but may not be tested.

Tam seeking BA approval to this line)
(Note: See also para 9 et seq below]
36 Calera for NR2+ Proof of Concept (Required for Stage 2 Acceptance if NR2+ and NR2 Stage 2

do not coincide) needs to be defined and brokered between the parties. It is not clear where the
responsibility lies for defining them, nor how they will be factored into the Acceptance process.

ic have suggested, (subject to internal BA agreement, which should be forthcoming by Monday
next) that our opening position should be that we must have seen and agreed:

1.NR2+SADD

2. NR2+ RCD

3. NR2+ Acceptance Specification,
and,

4. Pathway can demonstrate a version with no major Technical Test acceptance
incidents for which they cannot produce a credible plan to fix].

37 The Implementation Acceptance Specs need to be reviewed in the light of the replan.
(Note: a quick look shows that:

4, Please confirm that you acknowledge these as issucs which need to be addressed., and that their resolution
is being built into your plans.

Review of Acceptance Issues

3. Referring to the list of issues I provided to you in early August 1998, the previously identified issues are:

5.1

P.84718

No date or release plan specific Requirements or Test conditions except Requirement
913, criterion 16 Test conditions look to be Release plan specific and may need
changing

Implementation B

No date or release plan specific requirements or Test Conditions except!Requirement
916 criterion 1 Points to a specific document (Marketing and Education Plan) which
may need updating

Implementation C

No date or release plan specific requirements or Test Conditions

Implementation D

No date or release plan specific requirements or Test Conditions except that many of

1 would be grateful if you would confirm that the above reflects your understanding, and that
work is in hand to update the subordinate documents to reflect the replan working assumptions
Revised drafts would be appreciated in due course.

No overall plan for handling acceptance

We alluded to this issue when we met on 4 September 1998, and you advised me that a draft
narrative document and programme bar chart were imminent. I have subsequently received from
Tain Kerr (end was able to access on Friday) an early draft of a document “Horizon Acceptance
Plan” draft 0.2) on which I have sent early comments separately. Thanks, I have issued the
document to the BA Acceptance Working Group members to obtain a wider view, and hope to
let Inin have final comments by 21 September 1998,

‘There are some issues which need to addressed urgently, which are:
1. The plan needs to fully match the replan working assumptions.

2 ‘The plan needs to fully cover the processes and activities necessary to recover from the
lateness of the Acceptance Specs.
= 5 The plans need expanding to fully take into account that LT DO's, various areas of

CAPS, BA Audit, BA PAAG, BA Security, in addition to LT PO Outlets will need to
be fully aware of when, how and where to report an incident. They will need to be
identified, educated, trained and the appropriate processes put in place.

4. ‘The incident management processes need to be developed to fully cover:
7 An urgent business assessment of each incident, leading to rapid decisions on

the scale of any problem and urgent decisions on workarounds where
appropriate - the imperative is kecp the business going.

5. ‘The processes to provide assurance that the Acceptance Specifications fully meet
Contracted obligations, arc fully reflected in HLTPs and Scripts need beefing. The
description of HLTPs within the paper is a litle rosier than I have previously been led
to believe, and possibly misleadingly so.

6. There are other big holes which are identified in Drafting Notes which need to be filled
quickly.

7. We still (desperately) await a programme timetable for acceptance and a comprehensive
list of products, product descriptions and relationships.

Please confirm that you have these issues in hand, and advise dates.

52 Relations with Pathway need to be clarified and visible
We generally agreed when we met that this needed to be addressed, and you suggested that this
may be satisfied in part by my inclusion in a tri-partite Acceptance Manager’s forum. You were
going to let me have proposed ToR.
I note from the Horizon Acceptance Plan para $ that three forums are being proposed, the
Incident Review Panel, the Acceptance Management Forum and the Joint Acceptance Board. 1
Presume that it is the formightly Acceptance Management Forum which you referred to at our
meeting. I would be grateful if you would set that up immediately and let me have dates. It is
possible that Peter Crahan will also wish to attend from time to time. Are you able to offer draft
ToR yet ?
In addition, as I mentioned to you when we met in August, I need to see minutes of all mectings
with Pathway relating to acceptance, but I do not appear to be getting them yet. Could you
arrange for me to be notified of all meetings with Pathway which address Acceptance issues and
for me to be copied into agendas and the minutes.
Please confirm agreement and dates

53 Pathway Acceptance Test proposals and plans
Thave not yet seen Pathway’s detailed plans, Please update me.

54 No agreed meaningful or doable timetable for clearing Acceptance Specifications
T know that Iain was working on a MS Project Timetable. He promised to let me have a copy
when it was sufficiently advanced. But I have not yet seen it. I would be grateful if you would let
me have a copy urgently.

In the meantime, I shall be putting together our thoughts over the next day or so, and will copy
you in to the initial draft.

Please update on progress. (Note that to help you move this along, we shall be considering
Separately what BA would like to see in place, and I will copy you in).

5.7 _ Pathway Configuration management
Please update on progress, In particular, we need to be assured that there is central version
Control, that testing will confirm that when one element changes, all linked elements continue to
work, and to see the processes which will enable this to be managed.
We also need to know what action Horizon propose to take to ensure that it is properly managed.
5.8 NR2+ PoC undefined

Please sce para 3.6 above, where, to move this issuc forward, I have set out BA’s opening
Proposals. Confirmation that you can proceed with Pathway on that basis would be appreciated.

59 Uncertainty of Acceptance Criteria Sourcing & of currency of document set

‘Thank you for assuring me when we last met that HLTPs and Test Scripts have been QA'd by
Horizon to ensure that they are NR2 compliant. An update on other issues would be appreciated ,
addressing , in particular:

* Action being taken to ensure that the full set of Contracted Obligations required by AA
Schedule C3 are reflected in the Operational Trial Criteria (see my comment on para
3.7.2 of the Horizon Acceptance plan)

J Action being taken to ensure that the subordinate documentation pointed to by
Acceptance Criteria is clearly identified (by Version), that the versions are populated
and signed off and reflect current agreement

bd Action being taken to ensure that all contract changes have rippled through to the
relevant document set, and that the Change Control processes cover these documents.

ba That the database you are developing includes the design objective that it will allow
tracking from acceptance criterion to actual test, and back up again, and that the design
complies with this.

310 Start of Acceptance Testing - Relationship to sign off of Acceptance Specifications

I note from our earlier meeting, and from the Horizon Acceptance Plan that start of testing of the

OT system starts 25 August, and that you have put in place an agreement with Pathway (which I

support) that any changes to testing arising from changes to Acceptance Specs will be

introduced and tested during post MO regression testing. (Thank you).

Thave E-mailed you separately about the need to liaise with Parry Jenkins over the detail of how
this will be handled, and I assume you have now contacted him.

5.11 Number of Acceptance Specifications
T note that you have now incorporated within the Horizon Acceptance Plan the concept that the
23 Acceptance Specifications constitute a single logical Operational Trial Acceptance
Specification. Thank you.

5.12 PAS Single Key Issues in BES

‘There are two issues.

POL00028100
POL00028100

P.87718

1? SEP *98 1@:29 FROM BA-POCL PDA FELTHAM

pt The was an agreement of principle in drop down that requirements which referred to
PAS, which, because of this suppliers umique distributed system, were delivered in

2. There are some cases where both PAS and BES have to work in concert, to achieve the
required end result, and others where the functionality has been entirely shifted to BES.
within PAS, and that within BES both need to be tested for Acceptance. Where,
however, all the functionality was transferred to BES, then only BES would need to be
tested to enable a tick to be placed in both the BES and PAS boxes. AA Clause 203.1
allowed the latter scenario, Pathway, however are seeking to invoke the Clause to avoid
testing complementary functions in PAS arising under the former scenario. They
intend to rely on a test solely within BES. This is unacceptable.

As you will be aware, I discussed these issues with Karen Rogers last week, and agreed with her
that the simplest way forward was:

t To issue change requests to correct the drop-down omissions, and
2: To take a firm line with Pathway over issue 2 above.
1 am aware that discussions are already taking placc between BA and POCL on the first issue,
with a different perspective in view. I have beca asked not to proceed with the change control
Rote at this stage, rather to run the proposal in more detail past CAPS Commercial. I shall be
doing this within the next couple of days, and no doubt Horizon will hear from them if there is a
BA decision to proceed.

5.13. BA Acceptance Strategy to be produced and brokered

This clearly has to be on the back of the Horizon plan, but I probably have enough now to start
the ball rolling again.

5.14 Uncertainty as to Replan
Subject to your agreement to the comments I have made in respect of the Horizon Acceptance
Plan, I think we now share working assumptions, which will need to be monitored, and factored
into both our plans.
5.16 Replan needs some brokering of Acceptance Terms
Tshared with you a set of BA objectives for Acceptance Terms for the replan, and note that some
have been incorporated into the Horizon Acceptance Plan. Others have not. I would be grateful
if you would update me on your perspective re these objectives.
New Acceptance Issue
6. At the BA Acceptance Working Group on 10 September 1998, 1 was asked to introduce a new
Acceptance Issue, which is that the practical mechanics of execution of the Acceptance process are
unknown,

7. This issue has now been partly addressed within the Horizon Acceptance Plan, and I have indicated
within the comments I have provided where I have concems.

8. seach net few days, 1 shall be seeking to amplify those concems, and set out skeleton thoughts for
Geveloping the BA side, and submitting them for approval by the BA Acceptance Working Group, T wil
Share these thoughts with you at the same time.

New Release 2+ Acceptance Specification - risk of late delivery

9. Concern was raised at the BA Acceptance Working Group meeting that unless we buttoned down the
NRO* Acceptance Specification at an early stage, then we may be vulnerable to Pathway seeking to alter
the terms at a later stage.

10. One way forward tw reduce this risk is to ensure that agreement of the NR2+ RCD and the NR2+

Acceptance Criteria are components of evidence of sufficient progress in the development of the NR2
Stage 1 sign off., and I have proposed this at para 3.6 above.

Status of Audit, Reconcitiation and Security Panels in relation to Acceptance
ay In considering how we organise our Acceptance Processes, one of the issues we must consider is the status

of the Audit, Reconciliation and Security Panels in approving Acceptance Specifications, These panels do
an excellent job bottoming issues.

13. T shall be giving some thought as to how this best might be achieved for BA, and perhaps it is something
‘We shall be able to discuss when next we meet.

14, T would be grateful if you would inform me how Horizon is now structured to deal with Security issues
and who the personnel are. Who is looking after security Acceptance issues and what processes are in
place ?

Next Meeting

15. After we last met, Iain tried to book a farther meeting, but was unable to do so, I would like to meet w/e
21 September if possible, and presently have available Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday, Please
confirm that one of these days is suitable.

Conclusion

16. Jam sory that this minute has tumed out to be so long.

17. Nevertheless, I would be grateful if you would update on progress and issues by cop Wednesday 16
September to enable me to brief Peter Crahan before the next CAPS and Card Programme Board on 18
September.

Memorandum
To: Paul Wootton From: Colin Oudot
Address: Product Management Team
Post Office Counters Lid
Date: 16 September 1998
ce: John Meagher
SUBJECT: Acceptance Issues
Rha As we discussed earlier today, John Meagher is currently on 3

days annual leave and in the light of your requirement for a
response to your minute by CoP today I agreed to provide an
interim response.

Your Para. Interim Response ]

2 Noted, thank you

= Pa I agree, Ian Kerr is in the process of producing an
I integrated Plan. The major contribution to this is
the Pathway Acceptance Plan and I understand that
this has now been sent to us.

S22 I agree that this needs to be done.

av There will need to be an agreed definition of ProofF
lof Concept for Mobile Configurations. The
xvesponsibility for this will lie with the Horizon
Acceptance Manager.

3.4 You kindly agreed to produce a straw man for this.

3.5 Thank you for your proposal. This will obviously
have to be agreed with Pathway. I would point out
that I personally would consider no. S to be both

ees impractical and unachievable.

3.6 As above except that 1 Personally do not have any
issues with it.

Sue Clearly there will be implications on
Implementation and these will need to be I
considered.

er Ii agree that the Horizon Acceptance Plan requires

further levels of detail in some areas without
necessarily agreeing to all of the Points you have
raised. As we discussed I am not convinced that all
of the processes you describe are part of an
acceptance process but there obviously needs to be
a discussion between Horizon/BA/Pathway regarding
the interaction between live incidents and
acceptance incidents.

Se I am unaware of John’s progress on the TOR and
dates but will ensure that he forwards to you as
soon as they are available.

Sis As mentioned above I believe that Pathway’s plans
have now been sent to us. Provided they are
confirmed as fit for purpose they will then be
issued for comment.

5.4 Work on this area is continuing. Your thoughts will
ef course be welcome.
5-5 i do not believe that this basis conflict will be

resolved by exchanges of correspondence and propose
that it forms part of the agenda for the ist
Acceptance Managers Forum so that you can argue the
contractual status directly with Pathway.

-6 Tam unable to comment

7 Horizon have sought to ensure Pathway’s
configuration management through logical revue and
I’m sure that John will be happy te discuss with
you how Horizon may in turn assure BA. i

5.8 Dealt with earlier

eee i can confirm the design objective of the database
is as you state. I will not be detailing actions be
taken in this interim minute.

5.10 I am unable to confirm if Parry has as yet been
contacted but I will ensure that if not John will
do so on his return.

S a2 i await the outcome of BA’s deliberations.

eas I_ appreciate your positive approach to this.

10 As discussed earlier 1 think your proposal is a
valid one.

cas Again I feel that your comments are valid and
worthy of discussion at our next meeting.

1¢ The product Assurance team within Horizon is

currently the subject of a re-organisation but John
; should be in a position to inform you of relevant
security related responsibilities and deliverables
some time next week. As a current planning
assumption it is probably safe to assume that

ICL Pathway Support Notice - New Release 2 Version: 1.0
Model Office & End to End Dater 1/8/98

4.1. Normal Working Hours Support

During Normal Working Hours, the support route will operate as the Live Operational
Service, All application, operational and infrastructure calls will be raised on the
HSHD and Payment/Card/Pun related calls will be raised on the Payment Card
Helpline. (NOTE - Girobank are not providing the Payment Card Helpline facility for
E2E testing. )

‘The 24, 3rd and 4® line Support routes will operate in a similar way to the Live
Operational Service. The only amendment is that 3“ line will pass calls to PIAT rather
than direct to development. If PLAT decide a fix is required they will pass the call to
Release Management to authorise the fix. Once the fix is authorised Release
Management will farward the call to development. See Appendix 4.

The expertise and knowledge of the Pathway T&L team may be used to aid in the
Support process during the MO period.

‘When a call reaches 3" line the call type will be amended to:

N - for MORI and MOR2
M - for MOT
E-forE2E

For full details of phone numbers and operational hours see Appendix 2.

4.2 Out Of Hours Support Routes

During Out Of Hours minimal HTT testing is planned. Any problem occurring out of
hours should be in the area of file transfer of data to and from the MO Data Centre,
transfer of data to or from the MO Counter Environment or problems to do with the
operation of the system.

The Support Route during these times is direct from Outsourcing Operations to 3rd
line support and the E2E or MO Manager. 3 line will call in whomever they deem

Ne appropriate. The E2E or MO Manager is called in case there may be a delay to the
plan or authorisation is required to perform any data changes.

43 Call Logging

All issues requiring ICL Pathways attention must be logged via the HSHD.
For calls from HTT the FAD code of the relevant post office should be sufficient.
For calls raised by other areas involved in testing the following codes should be used:

PAT900 for MO
PAT901 for E2E
The HSHD call logger must ensure the text of the call includes a statement detailing
whether it is a MO or an E2E call.

Input into CAPS Programme Board Report
for Meeting on 18 September 1998

1 Introduction
This report summarises the state of the Horizon Programme as at August
month end.

2 Programme Overview

The major focus of the Programme at the current time continues to be:

+ supporting the existing live systems

+ supporting the testing phase

+ progressing the ‘Programme Management’ content of the Replan with
respect to the Live Trial, multiple Benefits and the NR2+ Release.

+ clarifying the contractual implications and acceptance process arising
from the replan.

+ developing the Live Trial plans in detail.

+ developing the 1c to NR2 migration plans in more detail.

3 * Live Operations
The current Release continues to provide a Benefit Payment Service and
Order Book Control System for Child Benefit Payments in 204 outlets
(119 in the South West & South Wales Region and 85 in the North East
Region).

From an operational point of view, there are no major threats to business
continuity.

Concern over the level of incomplete transactions (ITs) continues. These
have risen to 5.6 per 10,000 during July (from 4.0 in the previous month).
The main reason for this increase is due to a single category, BES/OBCS
Corruption (which represent 47% of all Incomplete Transactions)

Operational workshops continue to be held to address this issue and the
resultant fixes for various categories of ITs have been placed in testing.
Evaluation and analysis of these fixes are imminent. If solutions prove
successful it is foreseen that categories of ITs and consequently volumes
will reduce dramatically - particularly those in the category mentioned
above. Forecast implementation of these solutions is 22 September (on
the assumption that testing is successful and passes acceptance by sponsor
organisations). -

During July there were approximately 68,000 encashments (including
foreign encashments) with a total value in excess of £2m.

The Horizon Service Management Team continues to produce a monthly
Service Report which includes service performance reports and
operational issues / threats. The latest report was issued on 28 August
(BA/CAPS are included on distribution list).

Progress against the Master Plan and Integrated Programme Plan
The Programme Master Plan (MP version 4) and Integrated Plan (IPP
version 1) will be updated following the formal agreement to the Release
2 replan. Progress is being monitored against Pathway High Level Plan

5 ICL Pathway Release 2
5.1 Current Status
Planning

Dialogue continues in order to resolve issues affecting the Replan
particularly with regard to the Live Trial, the multiple Benefits
introduction and the release of NR2+. Agreement has been reached on thé
structure and dates for MOR, MOT and E2E activities for release 2
(POCL and Child Benefit functionality). In addition, agreement has been
reached on the 1c to NR2 migration plans, including the Data Centres, and
the installation of the extra 100 offices. Work is now necessary to develop
the detailed aspects of this plan and Pathway have been invited to
commence work in this area. Meetings with BA arranged for 9
September.

Testing :
JSA MOT third cycle is progressing well and is due to complete on
schedule mid September in time to feed into (Horizon) MOR2 .

MORI completed satisfactorily on 26 August 1998. Overall impressions
of the counter service from the users (trained counter staff) and the
Horizon Test Team have been that the counter is working well: that it is
useable and resilient, that it performs with speed and that the error and
exception handling messages/functions are present. The majority of
current problems are considered to be of minor importance and are
expected to be fixed for MOR2 which is planned to start on 14 September.

The MORI phase has been successful. Pathway have been able to prove
their live architecture, in particular the data centre and its migration, the
network and communications, and the connectivity between the counter
and the data.

E2E progress is slow but steady. The E2E cycle is being run in a more
deliberate manner than MO, allowing serious errors to be fixed before
progressing. The expectation is that most of the first cycle will be
completed by the target date. At this stage it is too early to predict whether
there will be an impact on the final end date of 18 December. The latest
position on testing will be presented by the Horizon Programme Director
to the CAPS Board at the meeting on 18 September.

Acceptance

During the period, management of the acceptance team was further
strengthened with the recruitment of an Incident Manager and a Process
Manager. Further recruitment continues to bring the team up to full
strength. A review of the support tools has completed and additional
hardware has been ordered.

The acceptance framework, which provides a business top-down view has
now been developed and is being used to provide a review of the
adequacy of the acceptance approach. A gap analysis continues and will
be completed by the first week in September. This will be followed by

further analysis to determine whether the identified gaps can be filled by
other parts of the contract or whether they are true omissions.

, The Acceptance Preparation Stage is continuing with the review and
agreement of the acceptance specifications. ICL Pathway’s target for all
specs to be completed and signed-off by mid-August was not met and the
implications are being assessed. All 23 acceptance specifications have
now been received from ICL Pathway and reviews continue. There are
still a number of problems in this area and additional efforts are now being
brought to bear to improve the overall situation.

Formal management forums are in the process of being established for
acceptance. Draft Terms of Reference for the Acceptance Managers’
Forum have been completed and invitations to members will be issued
toward the end of August.

Implementation

General

The Implementation Risk Register has undergone a complete review with
the second iteration, including updates on mitigating action, issued 1
August.

The Horizon Implementation Board met on 11 August and will continue
to meet on a monthly basis to co-ordinate progress and address issues.

Installation

An updated Installation Strategy is expected from ICL Pathway for POCL
sign off by 21 August. A signed off copy of the Survey Requirements has
been received from ICL Pathway (excluding Flat Screens). A revised
Survey Document reflecting the Flat Screen option has been received and
is under review.

Training
Model Office training and training of Survey Support Managers has been
completed.

Migration

A draft plan and draft interim procedures for implementation of NR2 in
Release 1c outlets have been produced. The Outlet Migration Strategy is
being redrafted by ICL Pathway taking into account recent developments
in the ECCO migration process. Discussions are underway with ICL
Pathway to obtain their sign-off of the migration tool functional
specification. Interim tools were used in MORI, and some difficulties
were experienced. Revised migration software tools will be ready for use
in MOR2.

Live Trial

Work continues to draw together the details based on the Horizon replan
which proposes a 17 week Live Trial. The justification for the 17 week
period has been presented to Pathway though this has not yet been
formally accepted by them given the wider contractual issues.

National Rollout

A meeting between Pathway and POCL increased the joint understanding
regarding the trigger points for starting rollout and the currently agreed
ramp up volumes. Further work is necessary to develop this and to link

with the Live Trial plans.

to the delivery of Release 2. These issues are being actively managed
within the Programme.

1 Introduction

This is a summary report addressed to Pathway and Horizon management to comment on the
conduct of the Model Office Rehearsal 1 phase of Pathway’s Release 2 testing. It focuses on
the testing environment, the testing activities performed, the results of these, and the
conclusions drawn.

The appendices contain additional supporting information to the text.

2 Scope and Objectives

MOR! is the first of three planned Model Office Rehearsals. It’s major objectives are to
prove:

Pathway’s solution architecture, network and connectivity
Pathway’s supporting infrastructure
migration from Release 1c to R2

supporting and reporting processes and routes are in place

It is not a purpose of MORI to perform R2 functionality proving although note is taken, and
incidents raised, in response to errors found. Due to the nature of this test it was expected that
there would only be time for a small subset of the available counter tests to run successfully.

The format of the testing was for the Horizon test team to run a series of scripts and test cases
jointly devised by themselves, the Benefit Agency and TIP, at a Model Office site based in
Borough High Street and supported by Pathway operations at the R2 target live operational
environment in the Bootle data centre.

3 System under test

3.1. Environment

The test environment within the Pathway domain comprised two data centres, one at release
1c and the other the target R2 go live solution, with links to all external systems. Full details
of these are given in Appendix A.

offices were migrated from release 1c to R2; four new offices were introduced into the R2
system, two from ECCO and two that were previously manual. The counters were the current
Pentium baseline rather than the proposed future Pentium 2.

i
I
The test environment within the Horizon domain comprised seven Post Offices; three of these I
I

Gateway PC’s, for the transmission of data to remote sites, were located at Famborough,
Huthwaite and De La Rue, Tewkesbury.

3.2 Software

The following applications formed part of the testing baseline:
m BPS :
m@ EPOSS
m APS
™ OBCS

The software release was 8F increment 4, with some additional changes made to this baseline
during the test cycle. These changes were notified to the relevant testing partners, and are
identified in Appendix B of this document.

4 Test Conduct

4.1 Test Phases
The testing was performed by Horizon test staff and Post Office counter staff over the period ©
3" August to 27" August inclusive, the stages being:

m 3"_ 11" phase 1 of migration, moving three outlet operations from
telease 1c to R2, with the data centre at release 1c

m 12". 13", data centre migration to R2
m 14.27, full R2 operation and the introduction of new R2 outlets

CAPS were not available to participate in this phase of testing, their input being simulated by
Pathway. As a result, the BA PACS reconciliation group could not participate.

4.2 Tests.Performed

The following are the test statistics:
™ numberof planned scripts 5089
@ number of scripts run 4072
™ number ofscripts passed 3734
™ percentage ofscriptsrin’ 80%
™ percentage of scripts passed 91%
a

As a result of some initial connectivity problems the scheduling of script running was re-
planned, after which the revised timescale was achieved.

4.3 Testing Incidents ,

Throughout the test cycle a number of incidents were raised. These are summarised as

follows:
Total Incidents raised 341
Incidents Closed
no fix required 120
fix applied during MORI or due 80
; in MO2 ,
duplicate of existing PinICL 55
Incidents still open 86 *

* denotes: 7 fixes are included in the MOR2 baseline for open incidents.

Remaining open incidents will be carried forward for MOR2 reporting

5 Conclusion

5.1. Summary

MORI successfully proved the test phase objectives, namely that Pathway’s architecture,

networks, connectivity and supporting infrastructure are all fit for purpose. Some issues were

identified, none of which are considered to be major, and these can be addressed in the later
_ Phases of MOR.

Although of a lower testing priority, the degree of application functionality executed was
higher than expected.

5.2. Achievements

The following have been successfully demonstrated:

™ Bootle R2 data centre build
networking and communications
data centre security
installation of outlet equipment
auto-configuration of R2 counters

‘migration of outlets from Release 1c to R2

use of MiMan migration tool and HFSO procedures

outlets were migrated using the manual migration tool instead

™ the data prepared for input.to the manual migration process did not
lead to speedy use of the software tool ©

although used, the FTMS gateways were not sufficiently robust

there were no non-core reference data products available

some problems were experienced using the back office printer

Dear Dave,

ICL

As promised, please find below a current update on testing progress,

End2End

It is now planned to complete the first cycle of testing on 22/9, including CAPS Recovery
testing.

Inthe early stages of E2E it was discovered that the Reference Data supplied by POCL did
not contain valid Non Core products. It was agreed that this was required for E2E and the
quickest way forward was for Pathway to edit the file delaying testing for 5 days, rather than
wait for an RDP update.

‘There were a number of environment issues between Pathway and CAPS before Temporary
Tokens would operate. These were resolved after a 3 day delay.

Following these initial delays, E2E generally progressed at a day for a day without having to
restart. ° - .

The data centre was successfully migrated and MiMan and MiEcco successfully used to
migrate counters.

Transfers were made between HAPS, CAPS, OBCS and TIP. Some issues were experienced
and were addressed at the time. ,

Communication issues between CAPS and Pathway were resolved and On-Line CAPS

processing of Temporary Tokens, Urgent Payments and Urgent Stops were successfully
made.

. CAPS have had some difficulties matching their data and expected results. Issucs such as
‘payments not being loaded due to missing cardholder/beneficiary data need to be resolved by
CAPS before the next cycle.

Following the first day of CAPS Recovery testing tomorrow, testing will be suspended over
the weekend to allow CAPS time to address their anticipated Recovery issues.

PinICLs have been raised during the testing and will be addressed for later Cycles.

A meeting was held with Horizon, POCL and BA to discuss E2E progress and the movement
into the next Cycle, It has been agreed that the migration days run for cycle 1 will not be
repeated. This therefore reduces the cycle lengths of E2E and allows for the further cycles to
be aligned with Model Office cycles. It is expected that this will be agreed on 18/9 and
planned in detail at a workshop next week.

MOR2

Progress has continued through the week on MOR2.

' , y,
On Monday, the 1¢ Counters were delivered to Borough and the CAPS files were received q

and processed,

_ On Tuesday, the Ic counters were configured on to the System, further CAPS files were
received and processed and the National Stops file was loaded.

On Wednesday, tests were first performed on the Ic counters and then these counters were
replaced by R2 counters. During the following MiMan migration processing a potential issue
was detected, this was dealt with at Borough by zero filling the remaining Stock Units. There
is confusion as to whether these Stock Units should have contained data or zeros, but if this
is found to be an issue, the details can be added by Remitting In the Stock Unit information.

On Thursday, further testing has been performed on the final 1¢ Post Office and this is
currently now being migrated. The Post Offices previously migrated to R2 counters are now
being used for further tests.

At present we are on schedule for migrating the data centre from Ic to R2 this weekend, -

General

Pathway is currently working towards creating the Software build that MOR3 will be based
on. This build will contain resolutions to the remaining issucs identified in the MOR2
Release Notice and will deliver BES Fallback.

Pathway MORZ Release nasa
Introduction

This Release Notice defines the software baseline used for New Release 2 MOR2 and
identifies the set of known functional limitations associated with this baseline. The
limitations are grouped by Service below. No limitations have been added since the
MORI release notice and it is the intention to clear all limitations by MOR3.

The Baseline

The software baseline for MOR2 is referenced in the ICL Pathway change control
system as 9f incr 1.

Known Limitations

APS
* In the event of a printer problem, after printing the first APS receipt, the second
receipt (the office copy) cannot be reproduced for this transaction.

BPS

« Atreceipt printing time the system always prompts for an Authorisation To Pay
(ATP) receipt (even when it should request a normal encashment receipt).

* ifthe customer is a main beneficiary and an alternate payee, the system allows
collection as the alternate payee, but does not allow collection as the main
beneficiary.

* The EVP questions relating to the unique address question for No Fixed Abode are
not generated.

« The BES weekly encashment summary cannot be produced.

EPOSS

« If while attempting to print a Stock Unit (SU) balance report, you transfer the
session to another counter, then transfer it back and roll over the stock unit, alll the
stock in the stock unit will be lost.

© Stack entry help facility does not function correctly and an invalid tablet is
displayed.

¢ Bilingual receipt not produced at Welsh Post Office. Information has now been
provide by Horizon; this will be available at MOR3.

« Some keyboard function keys are not working correctly. They are however correct
on the touch screen.

TPS

« When reconciliation discussions between Pathway and Horizon conclude, we
expect a re-designed reconciliation to be delivered. Until that time issues in the
current design solution will remain unresolved. Discussions have now concluded

this issue will be resolved at MOR3

APS

* Session Mobility can cause duplicate APS receipt numbers.
¢ TIP cannot accept bulk input of AP transactions because of a reference data fault

which prevents this mode of operation.

BPS
+ An encashment transaction conducted by the Payment Card Help Line (CHL)

cannot be subsequently conducted in the Post Office. The Post Office is not
currently being updated by the PCHL system and, therefore, will not balance.

¢ Card activation by swiping does not function correctly. Card activation can be

achieved via the keyboard. Once activated via the keyboard all subsequent
transactions can be performed by using the card swipe.

* Benefit Payment Contingency functionality (i.e. payments to beneficiaries when

CAPS is down) does not function.

* The counter allows more than two foreign encashments within the 26 week limit.
¢ The EVP questions relating to 2™ line of address no longer relevant to Release 2.
* The counter does not recognise card batches as “activated” when they have been

actioned at the PCHL.

EPOSS
* Transferring stock between individuals within an outlet does not function.
» Suspense account tables are not being carried. forward across Cash Account

Periods.

* Ifa user is deleted whilst attached to an individual SU, SU rollover is prevented

and the Cash Account is not produced. It is advised not to delete users under these
circumstances.

¢ There remain a number of scenarios that lead to an imbalanced Cash Account

Briefing Note Onts badd

Host File System Failure

Background °.

The Host system is the main processing facility at the centre of the Pathway Horizon
system, i.e. the sequent server. ;

The Host runs CMS and PMS applications and takes data feeds from the CAPS
system.

The Host failure in question effectively stopped the data feed from CAPS, this did not
affect counter payments (Payment authorities had been sent down the day before and
distributed as normal).

This did however, prevent the Stops being sent through (these come through as they
happen and are sent at any time). _

In these circumstances the contingency procedure is for ICL Pathway to notify the

DSS of the incident and to implement a fall back process. This entails DSS faxing

stop details through the PCHL The PCHL then apply the stops onto the system

manually and these are then distributed to the outlet.

Events

¢ A failure occurred on the main host file systern (sequent) at 08.22 on the 11th June.

© The situation was retumed to normal by 22.15 on the 11th June.

¢ All the subsequent overnight processing was successful.

© Following similar instances at 12.15 on Saturday 13th June and the moming of the
24th (where again impact on the service was very limited) two sequent boards were
replaced. :

Impacts

“ e During the day CAPS files could not be processed.

¢ No impact upon customers at the Post Office counter because payment authorities
are transmitted 72 hours in advance.

¢ All payment stops were implemented via the Payment Card Helpline and no over
payment arose.

POCL Service Management 1 24/08/98

POL00028100
POL00028100

Further Action

* ¢ No further service breaks have occurred and close monitoring of the host file

system is in place.

The three outstanding issues with TA have been agreed and the
documentation is expected today or tomorrow. It is expected to be

Pathway Progress Report

GC reported that the new v5 Pathway plan is nearing completion and will
now be available to issue on 14" Sept. The delay has been due to re-jigging
the systems Test to accommodate MOR3. MC said that he would like to agree
the dates for Acceptance (see action 2312) to include in the plan.

GC confirmed that MOR1 had completed on schedule and that a closure
report is due this week. GC said that Build 9F for MOR2 was completed at the
end of last week. System.test activities are continuing and the MOR3 build
will be available to start formal acceptance testing on 1* Oct (though the
EPOSS main pass cycle 3 is targeted to restart to intercept the MOR3 build a
week earlier on 23" Sept).

AS said that Horizon needs a better understanding of the builds, incremental
changes and configuration management during the period of October and
November so that there is a common understanding of how to de-risk ©
MOR3/MOT from incomplete systems testing particularly with EPOSS.

To set up a presentation next week (week beginning 14 Sept) to provide
an overview of the build control, incremental updates and their
relationship with the various testing phases.

Horizon Progress Report

MC expressed concern that CAPS are not prepared to formally state what is
in their Release 3.5, 4.0 and 4.1. Prior to yesterday he had not been aware of
release 4.1. He said that Parry Jenkins had stated at the meeting last week that
on-line enquires would not be available in 3.5 yet AS believes that it is
included. He added that this presented a risk to the viability of Pathway’s
plans.

To obtain a formal definitive statement from CAPS as to what AS
functionality is to be included in Release 3.5, 4.0 and 4.1. 16% Sept

AS handed out copies of the Horizon Level0 plan which has been sent to
Horizon Management and CAPS, Pathway now need time to assess this

forward to AS. 14% Sept

To arrange to meet week beginning 14'' Sept to co-ordinate the Pathway AS/GC
Level1 v5 plan and Horizon Level plan and to incorporate all factors 11" Sept
discussed to date into the Master plan.

BMcN confirmed that he had seen a demo of MiMan which was fine. They
were now looking at how the mapping could be improved to ease the
process. CW said that it was possible to accept a new mapping table but that
the code was now frozen so changes, other than to the mapping table, were
not possible,

To investigate the sort of changes that need to be made to the mapping in BMcN
order therefore to improve and ease the migration process. ‘15 Sept

RS noted that although a response to the 9 MiEcco issues had been received
by Horizon, four of them appeared not to have been answered. RS promised
to provide details. :

‘To ensure that John Dicks, Pathway responds on the Acceptance
Scoping Report with comments, actions and recommendations’. JM will
speak to John Dicks to help progress this action.

JM said that John Dicks has replied to the framework but not to the
scoping study. JM said that he was following up with John Dicks.
Action ongoing.

‘To define for PJ what information needed to be included in the MOR
reports’,

SR is still following up with PJ. Since SR is on holiday until next
Monday (14/9) it was agreed that DD would follow up to resolve before
start of MOR2. It was noted that the basis already exists.

‘To ensure that the agreed principles for “reconciliation in BES
fallback” is fully documented and signed up to and that all the
outstanding issues are addressed’.

The three outstanding issues with TA have been agreed and the
documentation is expected today or tomorrow. It is expected to be
incorporated into MOR3 but CW would specifically confirm this.

JM to arrange a joint (Horizon, Ref Data and TIP with Pathway present) _

meeting / forum to ensure all are focused on resolving issués arising
from testing. -

Action ongoing. An update will be provided at the next Checkpoint
meeting.

John Dicks to provide John Meagher with details as to where in the
testing life cycle the various tests to be witnessed would take place.

JM has reached an agreement in principle with John Dicks and this has
been documented and sent to John copy to MC. It will in fact be
available for MOR3. MC has not yet received the email but will follow
up with John Dicks to ensure a response is sent.

TA to confirm when all the User Guides will be available.

Action Closed. CW confirmed that the User Guides would be available
for MOR2 (those not available at the start have an agreed availability
date). See further action 2601.

The possibility of an automatic confirmation of delivery of the
Checkpoint pack would be investigated.

Action Closed. Tests had been conducted successfully but problems are
still experienced with “blockages” within mail servers. An oral check

~ will be made first thing each Monday morning in future to confirm

receipt by Pathway.

JM to arrange for latest TIP plans to be provided to Pathway.

The ‘Ready for Testing’ date for Operational TIP is forecast for 5/4/99
with a Go-live date of 11/10/99. Lower level dates are required by
Pathway so the action is carried forward.

Notes

1. Horizon have reached an agreement in principle with Pathway regarding the witnessing of
the Acceptance tests which will coincide with MOR3. Supporting documentation on the
agreement is awaited,

2. Pathway confirmed that the User Guides would be available for MOR2.

3. Ithas been agreed that Horizon and Pathway will explore the potential for protecting data
transferred from POCL Reference Data during live running with a view to de-risk the
Possibility of data corruption.

4, Pathway reported that the new v5 Pathway plan is nearing completion and will now be
available to issue on 14” September. The delay has been due to re-jigging the systems
Test to accommodate MOR3.

5. Pathway confirmed that MOR1 had completed ahead of schedule, including migration and
running an NR2 outlet through a 1c Data Centre, and that a closure report is due this
week. They confirmed that Build 9F for MOR2 was completed at the end of last week.

6. Horizon and Pathway reported that problems had been experienced with E2E testing but
that these have been addressed and good progress has been made since last Friday. E2E
is now bedding down into day to day running and the necessary script proving is taking
place. There is a review tomorrow with CAPS, POCL, Pathway and Horizon to review
testing progress. This will look at MOR2 readiness and the outlook for completing the first
cycle of E2E. A number of options will be considered to improve the efficiency of the E2E
testing including how some of the migration tests could be better executed (e.g. by moving
into MOR).

7. Pathway said that it was too early to form a definite view on completing MOT and E2E on
18" December though progress was good to date and early indications are encouraging,
despite the problems in E2E.

8. Pathway confirmed the position with regard to the Implementation figures:

© 3424 RGM letters issued
71 MIB events run

2937 MIB attendees

1441 surveys scheduled
825 surveys completed
270 re-surveys scheduled

eeeee

9, Pathway confirmed that there is an internal meeting this afternoon to discuss the NR2+
plans and it was hoped to have a plan in place by end September. Pathway expressed
concern that CAPS are not yet prepared to formally state what is in their Release 3.5, 4.0
and 4.1. Prior to yesterday they had not been aware of release 4.1. There is still
uncertainty as to whether on-line enquires will be available in 3.5. These uncertainties
presented a risk to the viability of Pathway’s plans to support the multi-benefit phase and
NR2+.

10.Horizon handed out copies of their Level0 plan which has been sent to Horizon
Management and CAPS, Pathway will review this against the Pathway Level 1 v5 plan
before meeting next week to co-ordinate plans.

11.Horizon confirmed that they had seen a demo of the MiMan tool which was satisfactory.
Horizon are now looking at how the mapping could be improved to ease the migration
process.

12.Horizon said that there are concerns as to how the necessary changes to Training could
be incorporated and that there is a meeting with Pathway this Friday 11"Sept to address
the concerns.

13.It was confirmed that CAPS have stated that they will not be utilising Temporary Tokens or
Emergency payments in NR2 Child Benefit but that they will be supporting Urgent Stops.

14.Meetings between Horizon and Pathway to discuss the in-office migration had taken place
and a further meeting was arranged for Friday 11" Sept.

. 15.Horizon have submitted a paper to Pathway on the trigger points and ramp up of the
National Rollout which Pathway are now reviewing.

16.Horizon presented an overview of the Release Authorisation process.

17.Itwas acknowledged that the Release Authorisation was owned by Dave Miller in Horizon
although it was recognised that there would be separate reviews within Pathway,
BA/CAPS, POCL and probably Horizon.

18.It was noted that the criteria setting should also include Implementation, security and
performance and BA Seals of Approval (SoA). It was noted that the SoA needs to cover
the number of offices and Cards proposed to be rolled out for Live Trial.

19.Horizon accepted an action to ensure that the BA plans to trigger the cessation of Child
Benefit Order Books and the issue of Cards is agreed, bearing in mind the BA lead time on
this process and it’s impact on the Card Volumes. This needs to recognise the need to
increase the number of offices to 300 in early February 1999 with a corresponding
increase in the number of Cards that would be expected at that time.

Dear Vince.

Incomplete Transactions at Release 1C

Tunderstand that, on behalf of the CAPS Board, you expressed an interest in knowing the current state and
progress that has been made by ICL Pathway in identifying and eliminating the root causes of incomplete BES
transactions that have been experienced during Release 1C. .

‘There have been identified eleven (11) causes of incomplete transactions during the life of Release 1c.
Please find attached a table that identifies each of these, its underlying cause, and the actions taken to
eliminate or mitigate the problem and the effect of these actions. Also attached is a graph that shows the
progress over time of the total incidents of incomplete transactions and their ratio with respect to the overall
number of BES transactions.

‘You may note that as overall transaction rates increased, the problem diminished. In August, the success
rate was 99.98% - with less than 3 transactions per 10,000 being incomplcte, Our target is to continue to
reduce the number of incomplete transactions towards zero and we arc confident that where the cause is a
systematic error or where a systematic preventative measure can be devised then this will be achieved.
‘There will always remain a residual ‘human element’ for which there is no ready answer except that with
increasing experience of the behaviour of our end-user community we will be able to reinforce the
application of correct operational procedures through focused fecdback and transaction re-engineering,

Iwill be delighted to provide further explanation or clarification if required.

Yours sincerely

15 September 1998

Dear Vict ,
Incomplete Transactions at Release 1C

Tunderstand that, on behalf of the CAPS Board, you expressed an interest in knowing the current state and
progress that has been made by ICL Pathway in identifying and eliminating the root causes of incomplete BES
transactions that have been experienced during Release 1C.

There have been identified eleven (11) causes of incomplete transactions during the life of Release 1C.
Please find attached a table that identifies each of these, its underlying cause, and the actions taken to
eliminate or mitigate the problem and the effect of these actions. Also attached is a graph that shows the
progress over time of the total incidents of incomplete transactions and their ratio with respect to the overall
number of BES transactions.

‘You may note that as overall transaction rates increased, the problem diminished. In August, the success
rate was 99.98% - with less than 3 transactions per 10,000 being incomplete. Our target is to continue to
reduce the number of incomplete transactions towards zero and we are confident that where the cause is a
systematic error or where a systematic preventative measure can be devised then this will be achieved.
‘There will always remain a residual ‘human element’ for which there is no ready answer except that with
increasing experience of the behaviour of our end-user community we will be able to reinforce the
application of correct operational procedures through focused feedback and transaction re-engineering.

I will be delighted to provide further explanation or clarification if required.

Counter terminals ‘Time Out’ after 15 minutes of
inactivity. Unfinished transactions are not committed
once the terminal has timed out, Counter Clerk failed
to follow procedures and complete the transaction,

Code Fix to action on
time-out with pending
incomplete transaction,

Short term fix =Time-out period

Permanent fix - ‘Forced
committal’ fix - ensuring that an
incomplete transaction is
committed after 74 minutes.

Counter clerk begins a BES session, the session is
then suspended but not committed, A second BES
session is started and committed in the normal way.
‘The transaction from the first session is left
incomplete. Counter Clerk failed.to follow procedures

3. User Set-up

A new counter clerk is introduced to the system by the
Postmaster but is not allocated to any User Group. The
new Counter Clerk is still able to swipe a card and
print a receipt but the system will not allow the
Counter Clerk to ‘Finish’, resulting in an incomplete
transaction, Postmaster failed to follow procedures
and assign new Counter Clerk to a user group.

Code Fix to default the
user group assignment
and reinforce correct
operational procedures
with Postmasters.
