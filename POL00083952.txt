Process for awaiting TC — singletons

Version 1
15" Dec 2005

Owner: Marie Cockett

Branch Trading does not change the requirement to make good
losses nor does it replace the liability for losses policy agreed with
the National Federation of Subpostmasters.

If you have a discrepancy for an amount over £150 however, if you
can provide evidence that you should receive a TC for a mistake
that has been made at your branch then the process is similar to
now but you will not have a suspense table in which to hold
authorised amounts.

You will need to contact the NBSC helpline who having assessed
your request will allocate a priority rating dependent upon when you
are due to roll your branch trading. NBSC will then advise Product
and Branch Accounting to ring you. If agreed you will then be
asked to accept and settle centrally the amount of the discrepancy
and be given a reference number (similar to the process for TC
queries). The amount will then be held in your account whilst the
issue of the appropriate TC is pursued. Once the TC is available
you will be given only 1 option -- to accept and settle centrally. By
choosing this option you then effectively cancel the debt held on
your account.

However, if after investigation Product and Branch Accounting find
no discrepancy to compensate for the amount held you will be
advised and the item will be unblocked from your account and
recovery sought via your next request for payment statement.
Equally, if you do not have evidence to support your claim you will
remain liable for the shortage.
