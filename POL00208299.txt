Hi Andy

1am reviewing all the documents you have sent again — primarily re the points we talked through regarding processes
I commented on.

I'll let you know today if any points arise from that.
I have two other observations:

1. The Introductory section — minor typos pages 3,4,5 but also short bit of extra text on page 6
a. Many branch errors (including the two examples above) are most easily identifiable in branch. They
would not be evident to Post Office Ltd unless a complaint were made by a customer — top of page
6
b. Save when it conducts and audit.....physical cash is ACTUALLY in a branch, ONLY THE EXPECTED
AMOUNT PER HORIZON (item )
c. Andon page 3 at the very foot would it be fairer to say “remit or scope” as opposed to “professional

expertise”. I don’t know. I go with your judgment there.
2. Girobank section 17

a. 4.2.3 “If there was a discrepancy, the Subpostmaster could correct the Horizon records. For example
if there had been an actual deposit and a paying slip for £150 but the Giro PDR as keyed in by the
Subpostmaster said £1,500 then the Subpostmaster could reverse the £1,500 and rekey the £150 as
per the deposit slip, bringing the branch into balance.

b. 4.2.4.....sent to SANTANDER via Royal Mail. The Subpostmaster would then perform his end of day
cut off routines.”

c. 5.1 Second Sight refer to one part paying in books. In fact what the customer has used subsequent to
3 part paying in books is a card and a “cash ladder” (form G7001). The cash ladder is the table of £10,
£20 etc that the depositor would fill in to help their own count and to help the Subpostmaster check
the deposit. It is not retained by the Post Office. The fact of the situation is that Post Office and the
Girobank deposit process moved to the industry standard of card based deposits where there is no
paying in book. This is in no way unusual.

Thanks, Rod
