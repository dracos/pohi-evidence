Thanks Paula and no problem about zipping off.

I was very impressed with Tony and think he will do a very good job. I'd certainly encourage him to come forward with his views
not just on his part but the wider process (not least of all because it will ensue his bit fits neatly in with the rest and visa versa. It's
also reassuring to meet someone of his experience who was so clear that our chosen route was the right one.

So I'd give him enough time in the design stage to ensure that he manages a smooth landing for us which I am sure he will do.

For the Board today I went through the papers and sent Chris quite a comprehensive set of CFO comments/questions on Mon. We
had a chat yesterday and a follow up call last night - decent progress. On the cost reduction I'd like to see more pace and sizzle and
suspect he will need help to both design the new operating model and project manage the implementation. On supply chain I agree
with the conclusion that it's not a business we should be in (ie sell services) and therefore we should get out soonest and let someone
else deal with this back office process. Said to Chris we need to be much more imaginative about how we do that but with £60m pa
in play we have lots of different options.

Look forward to the debate

don't want us lurching to be overly generous or hesitant when the facts are clear. His independent steer will be helpful.
