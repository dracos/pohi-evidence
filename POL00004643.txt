27" September 2001

As per your instructions from your helpline I am putting my report about a missing

item from todays stock delivery in writing.

The missing item is a single mini sheet of flags and ensigns, value £1.08, only 49
were delivered and not the 50 sheets as stated on the advice note.

I would also like to take this opportunity of querying the reporting procedure, not only

has it cost me a lengthy conversation with your helpline at long distance, day

telephone rate, to initially report the shortage and give all the details. But I have had
to pay a member of staff to stay on longer to put the request in writing. So in addition

to the £1.08 refund I am entitled to I also need to levy a £10 administration cost.

I know that bureaucracy runs wild in anything the Post Office does, but surely this is

taking it to a new extreme. It was all a different story when we discovered a load of

extra stock included with ours a few months ago, a telephone call soon put that right.

Your sincerely
