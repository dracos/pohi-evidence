The appendices cover the following topics:

SmartMan Interfaces

This appendix gives details of the interfaces needed to support the use
of smart cards.

Cryptography and Key Management

This appendix gives details of the functions for key management in the
ICL Pathway environment, including the distribution of keys to post
offices.

System Management

This appendix describes the system management interfaces and the
facilities that must be considered when designing and developing an
application. Support for the interfaces must be incorporated into a new
application so that it can be configured as part of the Horizon system.
The necessary facilities must also be provided by the application for
handling by the integration, testing, release, and support activities
within ICL Pathway and Horizon.

interactions and the use of standard NT print spooling capability for the
back office A4 printer. Details of the NT interfaces are not given here,
as the default printer is used, but the smart card interfaces are
included in this document.

2. Data where this defines the business rules and the result of counter
transactions. All interfaces between applications are data driven. Each
application needs to provide data to support EPOSS functionality and
the models of this data, and the data that contains the rules needed by
all applications, are defined within this document.

3. Impulse where this determines when and under what conditions the
application is invoked. These are generated by use of peripherals or by
use of the buttons that define common functions within the Desktop
environment. The data involved is identified within this document.

3.1 Data driven

All business applications that have been developed within the OPS
domain, such as APS, are data driven. Those that are developed in the
future also need be data driven. The Riposte Message Server (RMS)
interface within the TMS Messaging Middleware provides the secure data
interface for all applications and for the Desktop components themselves.
In this environment, application interfaces are data interfaces supported
by the command sets provided as part of the Riposte Message Server and
other Desktop components. Defining the rules for each application in data
has the following advantages:

« It removes the need to ‘hard code’ business rules into the application
making them easier to change when business circumstances change.
Strict control has to be exercised however over such data interfaces in
order to establish the impact of migrating from one version to another.

e It makes rules that apply to more than one application readily available
and consistent across all applications that use them.

e It enables a consistent approach to be adopted when defining the way
messages are displayed to clerks during a customer session.

3.1.1 Data ownership

The data that passes across each interface is ‘owned’ by a particular
application and service. Some data is created by one application to be
shared with others. Any data that is application-specific, provided it
conforms to the system wide rules given later in section 4, can be defined
in the most appropriate way to support the processing undertaken by that
application. Any data that is shared must be formally defined and these
definitions are given later in this document.

3.1.2 Data interface types

The data interfaces used by each application within the OPS contain four
types of data as illustrated in Figure 3-2:

1. Business Reference Data

Business Reference Data defines business rules. This is supplied by
POCL across the Reference Data Interface as Type A or B:

e TypeA

Type A data can be applied automatically without any manual
interventions. Product price is an example of this type of data, or
the definition of a token such as a bar-coded bill.

e TypeB

Type B data requires manual intervention by ICL Pathway before it
can be applied. Scales data is an example of this type of data; ICL
Pathway enrich the data provided by POCL with Scale Service
product numbers.

2. Client Reference Data

Client Reference Data defines the business rules that are specific to a
particular Client. This Reference Data is not normally supplied via the
POCL Reference Data System interface but is delivered across a
client-specific interface. POCL Client Reference Data is handled
directly by applications such as APS.

3. Implementation Reference Data

Implementation Reference Data defines how a facility or function is
implemented, the messages to be displayed to the clerk and system
variables. This is supplied by ICL Pathway as Type C or D:

e TypeC

Type C data is used to define the temporal data needed by
business applications, and the menu hierarchy used to define the
products and applications available on all menu screens displayed
to the clerk. The definition of a product button is an example of this
type of data.

e TypeD

Type D data is used to define application- or Desktop-specific data
such as messages to the clerk and implementation parameters.
4. Transaction Data

Transaction Data defines the result of a transaction for both EPOSS
and any Client involved, and includes, for example, the amount
transacted, the product code used and Cash Account mappings.

Figure 3-2 Application interface data types

3.1.3 Business and Client Reference Data

Business and Client Reference Data define the business rules that must
be followed by the application. The rules come from two sources and
therefore have two owners:

e Token definitions: the definitions of any bar-coded paper, magnetic
cards or smart cards that must be processed by the application. This
data is owned by POCL and it forms part of the overall POCL Reference
Data set. This data is formally defined in the POCL Application Interface
Specification (AIS) and Technology Interface Specification (TIS)
appropriate to the application. This data is provided from the POCL
Reference Data System to the ICL Pathway Reference Data
Management Service. After conversion into attribute grammar format,
the data is distributed to the appropriate outlets.

e POCL data defining the product and accounting rules to be applied.
Again this data is owned by POCL and is provided via the same
mechanisms as token definitions.

e Client data definitions: the definition of client-specific rules such as
tariffs. This data is owned by POCL on behalf of the Client. This data is
formally defined in the Application Interface Specification (AIS) for the
application and is provided via a separate interface that is responsible
for ensuring that it is distributed to the appropriate outlets.

Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

3.1.4 Implementation Reference Data

Each application and the Desktop itself must have implementation level
reference data defined for it that covers:

e Definition of the mappings of all menu buttons on the screen to either
system or application functions. This data is defined in the OPS Menu
Hierarchy, which is maintained via the Operational Business Change
process. It is owned by the OPS service, and is not covered further in
this document.

e Definition of all messages output to the clerk. This data is owned by the
application to which it belongs and must be available to the writers of
counter procedures

e Definition of any receipts and reports produced by the application.
Again this data is owned by the application and must conform to the
definitions and layouts laid down in the Horizon Reports and Receipts
document.

e Definition of system variables such as the mode or type of session in
which the application is being executed. This data is owned by the OPS
service.

3.1.5 Transaction data

Each application must ensure that throughout a customer session the
appropriate transaction messages are recorded against the list or stack of
transactions maintained for the clerk, to indicate all the products or
services transacted during a customer session. This data is produced and
owned by the application, but must be shared with EPOSS for both Point
Of Sale and Cash Account purposes. There are occasions when additional
data needs to be recorded as the transaction proceeds, such as the status
information concerning smart card values, and this data can be created
independently of the transaction data and at the most appropriate time.
This data may or may not be sent to a Client.

3.1.6 Data Forward Compatibility

When data needs to be added or changed to cover changes or new
functionality, it is important that forward compatibility is maintained and
that both old and new versions of the data can be processed correctly
during a migration period, by any existing or changed application code.
Existing applications that have changed, or new applications, will coexist
in the distributed estate during the period of migration, and data remains
available until it is archived.

To achieve forward compatibility, the following rules must be followed:

e Both the changed data and new data attributes must be treated as new
data.

© 2000 ICL Pathway Limited COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Page: 24 of 173
FUJ00001368

FUJ00001368
ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS Ref: TD/STD/004
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

e Processing in existing applications will ignore the new data and will not
create data in the new format, so any agents that deal with the data
during the migration period must be capable of processing both old
and new data.

e Processing in the new or changed applications will use only the new
data.

e For deleted items, the existing application will continue to create the
attribute during migration, but any harvesting agent involved should
ignore the attribute once the changed or new application exists in the
estate. For agents that load data, the attribute will have to be provided
until it is no longer required.

3.1.7 Optional and Null Data

Not all data is required in all circumstances. For example, many items that
are sold in post office outlets are fixed priced, but there are some that are
not, and these are defined in Reference Data with minimum and maximum
permitted values. There is no need to record the minimum and maximum
values for fixed price products, since they have no meaning. Data
attributes such as these are therefore optional and should be omitted if
they have no relevance.

In other circumstances, it may be a business requirement to record the
absence of value, in which case the data value should be left null. For
performance reasons null data items should be kept to a minimum. Any
data items that represent true and false values should be optional items,
with the values set so that data is included for the exceptional case, but
not for the normal case.

3.2 Command set

The command set defines the call interfaces to the Riposte software
components that provide the environment in which each application
operates. The commands:

1. Provide access to the various kinds of Reference Data through the
Riposte Message Server interfaces.

2. Allow transaction and Client data to be created via both the Message
Server and Retail Broker interfaces.

3. Support interactions with both peripherals and the Desktop controls via
the Peripheral Server and Retail Broker respectively.

The Riposte software provides these interfaces except in two cases. For
smart cards, ICL Pathway has developed a generic solution and in the
case of A4 printing, standard NT facilities are used.

3.2.1 Application subset

The Riposte environment provides both the underlying Message Server
capability and the components that make up the Desktop itself. Any
Message Server command that impacts the OPS service is not to be used
in application code. These are identified in section 5.2.3 (Peripheral
Broker interfaces) and 5.5.3 (Message-handling interfaces). Similarly, any
Desktop commands that could impact a whole customer session by, for
example, cancelling the whole session, should not normally be used by
applications, unless the whole session is controlled by the application.
These commands are identified in section 5.3.1 (Retail Broker interfaces).

3.2.2 Data handling

The interface to the Message Server via the Riposte Broker is shown
below in Figure 3-3. It allows both persistent data such as the various
classes of Reference Data to be read, and transient data such as
Transaction Data to be written. If data is displayed to the clerk via the
transaction stack, the Retail Broker interfaces are used and the messages
are written to the message store at the end of the customer session. All
other data is written to or read directly from the message store.

3.2.3 Peripheral commands

All peripherals with the exception of the back office A4 printer are handled
via Peripheral Server commands. NT interfaces are used to communicate
with the A4 printer. The interfaces provided via the Peripheral Server for
the Horizon system are described in later sections and cover:

¢ Bar-code readers

e Magnetic card stripe readers
e Smart card readers/encoders
« Scales

e Touch-sensitive screen

e Tally roll printers

3.2.4 Desktop buttons

The Desktop displayed to the clerk is controlled by a number of OCXs that
define the shape, content and position of all the standard controls and
those controls available to the application developer. Use of a standard
set ensures that the image presented enables the clerk can react ina
consistent and predictable way. The Desktop estate, which comprises the
areas allocated to system and menu buttons, the transaction stack,

instructions to the clerk and messages that require actions, is controlled
by the Riposte software but allows the input and output of application
specific messages and data.

3.3 Impulse invocation

All the applications within the OPS are invoked by impulses. An impulse is
generated when peripherals are used or when specific events occur.
Touching a button on the screen or a message arriving at the counter
position are examples of impulses that create events. The impulses can be
divided into three types, as shown in Figure 3-4:

Figure 3-4 Impulse types

Different types of impulse are generated at the beginning and end of a
clerk session, at the end of a customer session and during the dialogue
with the clerk that results in the transaction being completed.

It is possible for an application to receive and process messages when no
user is logged on; the results are displayed at an appropriate time when
the user next logs on.

For a definition of sessions, see section 3.4.1.

3.3.1 Clerk session impulses

Clerk session impulses relate to the clerk logging on to and off from the
desktop service. A clerk may log on and off more than once a day, or not
for many days, depending on work patterns. The log-off may be initiated
by the clerk, or forced by the system after a defined period of inactivity.

3.3.2 Customer session impulses

As far as the customer session is concerned there is no initial impulse, but
final settlement completes the session for all applications. There are other
functions such as session discounts that can apply at the session level, as
well as dealing with any outstanding balances. The settlement impulse
allows the application to deal with any additional processing not provided
by the EPOSS application.

3.3.3. Transaction impulses

During a customer session, any number of transactions may take place
using the applications available within the OPS. These transactions are
normally initiated by the use of a token such as a bar-coded document,
magnetic card, or smart card. If none of these is appropriate, a button on
the Desktop screen when touched provides an impulse to initiate the
application transaction. It is possible also for the application to be initiated
by the receipt of a message that has been distributed from the centre.

Once a transaction has been initiated, it is possible that before the
customer session is completed, the clerk will return to the home menu, a
previous menu, or even suspend the session whilst dealing with another
customer. It is also possible that the customer may change his mind and
either decline to complete the transaction or change details within the
transaction. If the transaction being completed needs to check details held
by an external system, an enquiry is made and the application waits for
the result of the enquiry to be received at a message port. All these
scenarios provide impulses to allow the application to take the most
appropriate action.

Once the transaction has been completed and there is an outstanding
balance, the MoP (cash or cheque or vouchers, for example) must be

established, together with any additional functions such as transaction
discounts.

3.4 Application structures

The structure of applications within the OPS depends upon three factors:

.

Applications must support the session structures inherent in the
Horizon system.

Each application must be constructed so that it can support the range
of impulses it receives within the session structure.

For each impulse type, the application must be capable of interpreting
and creating the nested data structures provided by the Riposte
messaging software.

3.4.1 Support of session structures

The session structure is illustrated in Figure 3-5 and reflects the following
system and accounting imperatives:

The Cash Account Period (CAP).

The fact that the clerk may log on and off more than once during the
period that the outlet is open.

EPOSS must support POCL accounting processes, so Client sessions
must be nested within an EPOSS session.

End of Day (EoD) processing has to be co-ordinated so that the same
data is sent both to TIP and to Clients; this can result in customer
sessions being started and finished on different trading days.

The clerk must be able to transfer a session from counter position to
another (in most circumstances).

The clerk must be able to suspend a session and to start another one.

The system must be allowed to log off a user who has exceeded the
system’s parameter for the maximum elapsed time allowed for
completing a session.

e Any dialogue with the clerk to obtain additional data or to deal with
errors or options must be correctly structured.

e Transaction data recorded as a result of the dialogue must be
consistently maintained.

The structure for processing each impulse is simple; complexity is only
introduced as the result of the number of different types of impulse that
may be received and which must be processed.

The environment established for each application, shown in Figure 3-7,

includes:

e Configuration data such as NT registry settings and Riposte variables.

e Reference Data, as described earlier, for both business and system

context.

e Recovery data that supports the suspension of a session and also

session transfers.

3.5 Nesting of data

The Riposte message structures are de-normalised in that they allow
blocks of data to be repeated and allow the nesting of data, each set of
data contained within angle brackets. The kinds of structures used in
Riposte messages are illustrated in Figure 3-10. All messages include
data attributes provided by Riposte; those created by applications include
attributes created by the Retail Broker. Application data is separately
identified and when used by more than one application, must follow the
conventions identified in sections 4 and 5 of this document. Applications
interpret and create attribute grammar strings using Riposte-supplied
functions.

4 Business Functions

This section describes the business functions that are supported by the
Horizon system and the context within which application development
takes place. It describes the concepts involved and how they are handled
by the system. It identifies and specifies the structures that are required
and that may be used to pass data between different system elements.

The section describes the following topics:
e The Horizon EPOS Service

« Settlement

e Stock unit management

e Reporting

e Balancing

Business is transacted in an outlet by a clerk (or other employee) at a till,
using a shared or individual stock unit.

Stock units

Each outlet operates one or more stock units. Although there are many
patterns of working, typically one clerk is responsible for the contents of
any one stock unit, so it is possible to reconcile (balance) them on
demand.

Balance Period

The Balance Period defines the periods between committed balances.
There may be many Balance Periods for a particular stock unit within a
Cash Account, particularly when the responsibility for a stock unit is
handed over from one clerk to another — possibly owing to part-time
working practices. Note that in the case of a shared stock unit, several
physical drawers may comprise the stock unit.

Cash Account Period

The outlet reporting period is by Cash Account Period (normally a week
running from Thursday to Wednesday) although a facility is provided to
extend the Cash Account Period if necessary.

Sessions

During a Balance Period, business is transacted in sessions. A mode of
operation is associated with each session and is one of the following:
Sale, Refund/Reversal, Remittance, Revaluation, Transfer. The current
mode is checked by the system before a transaction is performed.

Transactions

Transaction records are collected into sessions and written to the
message store. They refer to individual products that have been
transacted. Transaction record additional data is written to the message
store for some product types; it is derived from Reference Data supplied
by POCL and is used to capture additional data for a POCL Client.

4.1 EPOSS

The Electronic Point Of Sale Service (EPOSS) is the Horizon application
that provides Electronic Point of Sale (EPOS) functionality. EPOSS is
driven by the rules that define the products that can be sold, their retail
price and any business constraints, such as discounts, that apply. This
section describes how products are defined and sold in EPOSS, and the
structure of the data interfaces involved.

The interfaces described in section 4.1.3 are those that provide EPOSS,
TIP and other Client applications with transaction and Cash Account
details.

The interfaces described in section 4.1.4 and 4.1.5 describe the
Reference Data structures that define POCL products and tokens.

4.1.1 EPOSS processes and products

Product definitions are supplied by POCL in the form of Reference Data,
which is distributed to the outlets so that EPOSS and other applications
can use the same set of business rules. Not all data is relevant to each
outlet and data is delivered only to those outlets that require it; its
distribution is determined by a number of data items defined in Reference
Data.

Data that is required by all outlets is referred to as core data. Non-core
data is data that is required by only some outlets: Vehicle Licensing, for
example, is performed at a limited number of outlets and only they receive
the relevant data. New and changed Reference Data is supplied by POCL
and POCL Clients in files that must conform to the appropriate Application
Interface Specification (AIS). Once validated by the ICL Pathway
Reference Data Management Centre (RDMC) POCL Reference Data is
converted into a format suitable for transmission to outlets, using Riposte

It is the structure of this data, held in attribute grammar format, which is
described below. Each application at the counter has access to this data
and must use it to ensure that the correct accounting data is recorded, and
that any additional data required by POCL or the Client is captured when a
transaction is completed.

All products have a unique reference number and a number of
characteristics that are referred to in the Horizon environment as
attributes.

Products with numbers in the range 10,000 — 20,000 are reserved as
private products required by ICL Pathway. The range has been agreed
with POCL.

4.1.1.1 Product attributes

Product attributes are those that are required to support the transaction of
the product, such as price and description, and are as originally defined in
POCL Reference Data before its transformation into the Reference Data
that is transmitted to the counters. Products include settlement products
(Methods of Payment) as well as traded products and services.

4.1.1.2 Product relationships

There may be a relationship between two products, ensuring that they are
traded together. An example of this is the range of postal order products,
which must always be transacted with an associated fee (mandatory
relationship). Transcash may be transacted with or without a fee
(non-mandatory relationship).

4.1.1.3 Product pre-conditions

There may be pre-conditions governing the use of a product, and these
are defined in Reference Data. Within the EPOSS application, for
example, TV licence stamps can only be used as a settlement product if a
TV licence has been transacted earlier in the same session. This pre-
condition is checked both when the Method of Payment (the TV licence
stamp) is selected and again at the point of settlement. If the transaction,
TV licence, is voided before settlement is selected, then the MoP, the TV
licence stamp, must also be voided before settlement can be completed.

4.1.1.4 Additional data

Products are made up of ‘core’ and ‘extended’ attributes of which some
attributes or attribute groups are defined as optional. The core attributes
apply to all products and the extended attributes apply only to certain
product types.

EPOSS has only one set of extended attributes. It is called ‘Additional
Data’ and is used to capture additional data that is specific to a particular
class of transaction. Different classes of transaction expect different sets
of additional data and these are recorded as separate Client transaction
attribute groups.

4.1.1.5 Session Effect attribute

The SessionEffect attribute describes a product’s behaviour at point of
sale in absolute terms, thereby allowing the system to calculate the
session balance in differing functions such as Serve Customer and
Refund/Reversal.

ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS Ref: TD/STD/004
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

The SessionEffect attribute defines ‘In’ as meaning an increase in the

balance due to the Post Office. An example of an ‘In’ product is a stamp
sale or a National Savings deposit. An example of an ‘Out’ product is a

green or violet Girocheque.

The attribute does not drive the accounting and reporting mechanisms; an
‘In’ product may not always appear on the receipts side of the printed
balance report. For example, for consistency, Rent Summaries appear on
the same side of the balance as Rent Vouchers.

4.1.1.6 Token impulses

Token impulse definitions identify and route data from data capture
devices through to interested applications, transforming the data into the
elements required by the target application.

The token impulse contains core attributes and a repeating attribute
defining each element of the token data. Elements have a defined ‘Picture’
that is used to identify a token when it is read and to uniquely identify its
type.

Tokens are only valid in assigned modes, ensuring that token driven
transactions only take place in an appropriate context. For example, an
automated payment card may be swiped and will invoke the relevant
application when the clerk is in ‘Serve Customer’ mode, but in ‘Rem In’
mode, it will have no effect.

Token input is validated against token definitions registered by the
application with the Peripheral Server. Because of special security
requirements, a separate process deals with details for smart cards.

4.1.1.7 Selling a product

A product is sold when it is transacted during a customer session, via the
Retail Broker interfaces, and appears on the transaction stack. A customer
session may consist of the sale of a single product or it may be a series of
transactions that terminate when settlement of the complete session
occurs. At this point all the transactions on the stack are committed and
the generated transaction records are written to the message store.

The sale of a product is started when a product is selected from a menu or
when input is received from another peripheral device, such as a card
swipe. Whatever the route, the required transaction must be identified,
and after any additional clerk interaction to capture additional data, a
transaction record created. For token input, default transaction details,
derived from token data can be used.

Some products have mandatory links with another product, which may
result in several transaction records being generated. A transaction on the
Retail Broker stack may contain several records that constitute a single
transaction; for example, if a postal order is transacted, its associated fee
generates a second record.

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

Transactions are described in a similar way to products and contain core
and extended attributes. The core data applies to all transactions, and the
extended data only to transactions of a specific type. One extended
transaction type is Additional Data, which is a transaction where specific
extended data has been captured from Reference Data, for purposes
irrelevant to the core EPOSS. Data other than this must be supplied using
a separate structure that is specific to an application and Client.

4.1.2 EPOSS data model

EPOSS data interfaces are based on the need to access the Reference
Data that defines POCL products and tokens, and the need to provide
EPOSS and the POCL TIP system with transaction and Cash Account
details.

These interfaces are described in sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 as data
models, in a structured manner that identifies the ‘owner’ of the data (the
software responsible for its creation), and the ‘recipient’ of the data (the
system outside the ICL Pathway service to which it is sent).

In these data model diagrams, the leaf in each structure represents the
data item that must be provided to support the interface. If the item is
optional, it is marked with an ‘o’. If it can occur many times in the same
structure, it is marked with an‘.

The data models are implemented as attribute grammar, which is itself a
structured way of defining data and so lends itself to this approach.

4.1.2.1 Attribute grammar structure

Attribute grammar defines each data item as an item name followed by a
colon (:) and the data itself. Each data item is delimited by < and >
characters (angle brackets).

The sequence of attributes is not important. Any application processing
this string looks for the name or value, rather than its position. Similarly,
the application ignores any field that is of no interest.

Attribute name cannot be null and can contain no full stops, angle
brackets, colons or double quotation marks. Attribute value is either a
string or an attribute grammar string and can contain blanks but not angle
brackets. Some other characters, notably ampersands, can cause
difficulties; refer to Escher documentation for details. Where these
characters can be accommodated, the resolution is to include two
consecutive instances of the characters in question.

The structure of messages can become complex; Riposte’s redit utility
can be used to display the nested structure of attribute grammar. The
example:

<EG1:<AAName:<AANext:bbb><BBNext:ccc>><AAOther:yy>>
appears as follows, using the redit utility:

<EG1
<AAName:
<AANext:bbb>
<BBNext:ccc>
>

<AAOther:yy>
>

It may be useful at this point to refer to section 5.5, which describes basic
Riposte functions and concepts, before continuing with the rest of
section 4.

4.1.2.2 Transient records

The data records created to support EPOSS and TIP, and any other Client
application, are transient; they are deleted from both the correspondence
servers and the counter after an expiry period, which is defined (in days)
by the application and which varies depending upon the business rules
that apply. The expiry period should be as short as is consistent with the
business rules so that system performance and capacity are not impacted.
Minimum and maximum values for expiry are defined at system level and
may override application-specified values.

At the correspondence server there is a separate audit function which
ensures that all messages created, either at the outlet or correspondence
servers, are archived for a period of 18 months for audit purposes.

4.1.2.3 Persistent objects

The data records that define Reference Data are by their nature temporal
and remain as persistent objects until their defined ‘End Date’ is reached.
Non-Reference Data persistent objects do not have an expiry date and are
not temporal in this way. The attributes of a persistent object remain
unchanged throughout a transaction, even if a new version of the
persistent object becomes current during the duration of the transaction
(see section 6.3.4 for information about Desktop reload). However,
because the current product data persistent object is obtained each time
the product is transacted, it is possible for different versions of a persistent
object to be used during a single customer session. If a new version
becomes current after it has been transacted during a session, any
subsequent transaction of the product will use the new version of the
product data persistent object.

All Riposte messages, whether transient or persistent, have the same high-
level structure. They all:

e Start with a defined attribute or tag
« Contain transaction data
e Contain security data including Cyclic Redundancy Check data

e Define each data item as an item name followed by a colon (:) and the

Each transaction in a transient message has to be identified and this
identification is provided automatically by Riposte. If the message is
written via the Retail Broker, it contains items that identify it in a session
context. If the message is not written via the Retail Broker, this session
data is not present.

Each application has to create the following data:
« The data it needs to support its own Client application.

e The data needed by EPOSS to support its Electronic Point Of Sale
(EPOS) requirements as defined in POCL-supplied Reference Data.

e Other data required by EPOSS for Cash Account reporting purposes,
also defined by Reference Data.

Each level of the data model is described separately in the following
sections.

4.1.3.1 Riposte level

It is at the Riposte level that the identification of the overall transaction is
maintained. The post office and counter position are identified, as are the
time at which the transaction occurred and the clerk or system responsible
for creating the transaction. Most of this data is passed to TIP and can be
passed to Client systems.

4.1.3.2 Retail Broker level

If the Retail Broker is used to create the message, session and stock unit
data is automatically included in the message. Session data identifies the
sequence number that applies to all transactions in the session: each
transaction has its own unique transaction sequence number within the
session. Times are recorded in hours, minutes, seconds and time fractions
(TFs).

Mode identifies the mode in which the transaction was conducted. For
applications other than EPOSS these cover normal Serve Customer (SC)
mode, reversal either in session or not (RV, ER) or fallback recovery mode
(REC).

dealing with products, as this information is required by POCL’s
Transaction Information Processing (TIP). If it is possible to transact more
than one unit of the product, both the quantity (Qty) and sale value
(SaleValue) have to be recorded. The sale value is signed to indicate its

relationship to the stock unit.

Figure 4-9 Persistent object

Each persistent object has to be identified. The identification is a
combination of that provided by Riposte, and any temporal information
recorded for that object. Persistent objects fall into two categories:

e Persistent objects that apply to Reference Data

From the point of view of the interfaces needed for application
development, it is the Reference Data definitions for products, Cash
Account mappings and tokens that are important. There are many
other types of Reference Data records but these are either desktop- or
EPOSS-specific. Reference Data persistent objects always contain the
attribute name ‘RData’ in their attribute grammar strings (see section
4.1.4.2).

e Persistent objects that do not apply to Reference Data

Types of non-Reference Data persistent objects define messages to
the clerk and error messages. These are application-specific and
belong to collections whose names are defined in section 9 of this
document.

Non-Reference Data persistent objects do not have a tag ‘RData’ (see
section 4.1.4.2).

4.1.4.1 Riposte level

The name of each persistent object is held at the Riposte level, together
with the name of the collection to which it belongs. Each Reference Data
object is temporal in that it has a start date and an end date. To support
this concept, Riposte maintains a separate object that points to the latest
version of the object. The suffix within this object is used to determine the
latest version.

Not all Reference Data is applicable to each outlet and it is the ‘Depend’
attribute that defines this relationship for all product data.

4.1.4.2 Reference Data types

The types of Reference Data that have a direct impact on application

development are:

« Product Reference Data

Defines the POCL products that can be transacted at the counter.

e Cash Account definitions
Define the relationship between the products and Cash Account lines.

* Token definitions

Define the structure and content of data on bar-codes, magnetic cards

and smart cards.

(see section 4.1.4.10)

(see section 4.1.5)

The RData tag defines the start of the data that is passed down to Desktop
applications. The Reference Data required to develop new applications
includes product, cash account and token definitions. It is possible that
other kinds of Reference Data may also be required for a new application,
in which case such Reference Data will have its own data structures.

4.1.4.4 Product constraints

There can be constraints applied to transacting a product, such as the
minimum (MnV) and maximum (MxV) value that can be sold in one
transaction. Similarly, the minimum (MnQ) and maximum (MxQ) allowable
quantity can be defined.

It may be mandatory for a receipt to be produced when the product is
transacted (SR), in which case the receipt number (Reptno) and receipt
type (RT) can be specified.

Some products must be transacted together, in which case there is a
mandatory product (MP) relationship. Some products can be reversed
(RV) in which case a reversal authority may be required (RA). Other
products can be voided (VO).

There may be a default service type (ST).

If data has to be captured when the product is transacted, this data has to
be defined item by item. For each item, the information displayed to the
clerk is defined in terms of the prompt (P), the name of the item being
captured (N), the caption used when it is captured (C), and a number
associated with the order (O) in which the items are captured.

For validation purposes, the format (F) and data type (S), as well
maximum (Max) and minimum (Min) values are defined. If the data fails
validation, the message (VM) to be displayed is identified. If any action is
allowed on the data (A) it is specified, as is the default (D) value presented
to the clerk.

If options are to be displayed to the clerk, they are listed in terms of the
text that identifies the option (Text) and the key value set of the option is
selected (Key).

4.1.5 Tokens
Tokens are a distinct subset of persistent objects and are described in this
section.

There are currently three types of token:

e Bar-coded documents

e Magnetic stripe swipe cards used for automated payment
e Smart cards

For each of these token types, a different subset of information is present
on the token. The data that is present on each token type and a list of the
data specified in Reference Data for each token type are described in
sections 4.1.5.1 — 4.1.5.4.

The definitions of tokens, as given in the collection established for each
application, are used by their respective applications at start up each time
the Desktop is reloaded to register with the Peripheral Server the tokens in
which they have an interest. If a smart card is used, the Smart Card
Manager is called. Unrecognised tokens are ignored.

Bar-codes can normally be scanned at any point within the Serve
Customer hierarchy. The Peripheral Broker uses a Validation Object to
check the definitions of the formats held in Reference Data to determine
which application is interested in the bar-code. Failure to recognise a bar-
code correctly can cause the wrong application to be invoked. This can
occur if the definition of the characteristics of the bar-code are such that
the definitions could apply to the bar-code produced for more than one
application. Bar-codes, which are numeric, are normally identified by a
combination of the following characteristics:

¢ Total number of digits that form the bar-code.
e Known values for specific digits within the bar-code.

If it is not possible to define the bar-code uniquely using these recognition
parameters, as is the case for LFS, the application has to set the mode
context prior to the bar-code being read in order to ensure that no other
application can receive the token impulse.

For each token type, Reference Data defines:

e How the token is identified by its token identity (TID) and optional
token name (TN).

« The data format on that token.

e Interface definitions to be presented to the application when the token
is invoked.

e Validation that has to be applied to that token.

« The way the token data is sliced to allow identification of data and its
validation.

e The modes in which the token may be used.

The reference data definitions received via POCL Reference Data at
present define the bar-codes, magnetic swipe cards and smart cards that
are needed to support Automated Payments via APS, Benefit Payments
via OBCS and EPOSS functionality via EPOSS and LFS. If different
tokens are required, the POCL Reference Data interface will have to be
updated.

For further information on the technology used in magnetic cards and
bar-codes please consult the appropriate POCL Token Technology
Specification. These specifications define transaction data, the way the
token is processed by the clerk and the use of check digit algorithms.

The examples used in the following sections are APS transactions, since
they have the most complex set of attributes.

4.1.5.4 Smart card
4.1.5.4.1 Token format

The format of each token is different for each smart card application.
Unlike other applications, data read from the smart card reader is handled
not by the Riposte Desktop and the Peripheral Broker, but directly by the
Smart Card Manager, SmartMan. SmartMan identifies the correct Card
DLL for the inserted card and notifies any interested application that an
impulse has been received.

4.1.5.4.2 POCL Reference Data

Persistent objects for each smart card application are held in Reference
Data. More details of smart card applications and their architecture and
interfaces are given in section 5.2.4 and Appendix A, SmartMan
Interfaces.

4.1.5.5 Token format

The format of magnetic card and bar-code tokens is defined in terms of the
length of fields (for magnetic cards and bar-codes), the security data on
the token, the tracks that are used (for magnetic cards) and any definition
of composite fields that need to be created from individual data items on
the token. For smart cards, the name of the DLL to be called and the cash
limit are specified.

Required length (Len) of the token, is specified if it is fixed length, or the
minimum (MinLen) and maximum (MaxLen) lengths, if not. The length of
the amount field (AMTLength) is also defined.

For smart cards, the definitions needed to complete the security checks
are given. For lower level security requirements, the POCL-supplied check
digit routine (CDig) is defined.

For card tokens, the track to be selected (TrkSel) is given if appropriate.
The composite fields definition identifies the elements to be included
(Element).

4.2 Settlement

This section describes the following concepts:
« Settling a customer session

¢ Committing a customer session

e Refunds and reversals

e Swapping between customer sessions

e Transferring a customer session

e Sending settlement data to Clients

4.2.1 Settling a customer session

A customer session is settled when Methods of Payment are accepted and
balance has been achieved. The Riposte Retail Broker Session Manager
handles the settlement of transactions and is activated when the clerk
touches the ‘Finish’ button. It is also invoked if a forced logout occurs (see
section 4.2.2.2 for a description of the forced logout process).

A user application can be called by the settlement process. EPOSS uses
this call to present the Method of Payment (MoP) menu and to ensure that
the net value of the session is eventually settled to zero net value.

4.2.1.1 Methods of Payment

In general, the outstanding customer session balance can be settled by a
single Method of Payment or a combination of two or more MoP (part cash
and part cheque, for example).

The methods of payment for settlement are dependent upon the actual
transactions in the session log. When the settlement function is invoked,
the system presents the user with a list of available MoPs. Product pre-
conditions determine which MoPs can be used to settle particular
transactions (see section 4.1.1.3).

4.2.2 Committing a customer session

4.2.2.1 Session completion

When a session is completed and balance has been achieved, the details
of the session are committed, a number of records are written to the
message store and a receipt may be printed. Both sides of the transaction
are always written to the message store: the sale of the product itself and
the amount and type of the payment (unless the balance of the transaction
was zero before settlement).

The number of records written depends upon the number of transactions
performed within the session, the type of products being transacted and

the methods of payment being used. Except in the case of a zero-value
transaction, which writes a single record to the message store, the sale of
a product and the associated payment from the customer are recorded as

two or more separate records. The example in Figure 4-33 shows three
records written to the message store for the sale of a TV licence, settled
with saving stamps and a cheque.

Figure 4-33 Attribute grammar: product sale and settlement records

All transactions written via the Retail Broker after settlement have the
same Sessionld and are treated as an atomic unit for the purposes of
committal and replication. This is true whether the session completes
normally, involves a session transfer or is terminated by the system, but it
is the responsibility of the application to deal with recovery situations.

4.2.2.2 Temporary lock and forced logout

If a terminal is to be unattended for a period of time, the clerk can use the
Temporary Lock facility to prevent anyone else from using it. When the
clerk returns, the password has to be re-entered.

A session is timed out after a period of inactivity (when there has been no
input from any of the peripherals) of a pre-configured length. After this
time, a user logon screen is displayed saying that the session is currently
locked by that user and that the user’s password needs to be entered to
unlock the screen.

If there is a further period of inactivity after a session has timed out, the
system forces a permanent logout. This results in the user being logged
out, and the Riposte logo appearing in the centre of the screen. If there is
a customer session in progress (including a suspended session), it is

committed against cash and written to the message store. The Method of
Payment in this case is recorded as cash even if there is a product pre-
condition (see section 4.1.1.3).

The system does not produce a receipt. When a user logs on again after a
forced logout, the Reprint Receipt function can be used to produce a
session receipt showing the transactions committed.

4.2.3 Reversals, refunds and voids

There are different rules and procedures for reversals, refunds and voids,
according to the token type and application involved. The business rules,
defined by the Client, must be interpreted within the application code.
These rules include whether or not reversals have to take place on the
same day as the original transaction (prior to End of Day), and whether or
not they are permitted if the counter position being used is not
communicating with the rest of the positions in the outlet.

4.2.3.1 Reversals

Reversals and refunds may be performed if POCL’s accounting and
business rules, on behalf of the Client, allow them.

There are two types of reversal:
e A linked reversal

The user must enter the transaction session number to initiate the
reversal. The existing transaction is not deleted from the message
store but an additional compensating transaction is created. This is the
recommended reversal method. In line with the business rules, a linked
reversal is compulsory for some transactions. A transaction may be
reversed once only, using the same stock unit and during the same
balance period and CAP as the original transaction. Some transaction
types (AP, for example) cannot be reversed once End of Day has been
completed.

e Anunlinked reversal (refund)

An unlinked reversal is performed if a customer wishes to obtain a
refund for a purchase for which they have no receipt, or if it is
necessary to perform a non-specific reversal for balancing purposes.
Unlinked reversals must be in the same CAP but may be in a later
balance period than the transaction being reversed; they are
accounting corrections and do not require the original transaction to be
identified. For an unlinked reversal, a negative sale is transacted and
written to the message store.

4.2.3.2 Voids

A transaction can be voided (cancelled) within a customer session
provided that the customer session has not been committed and that the
Reference Data supporting the product allows that product to be voided.
(To void a transaction, the user selects the Bin option and then selects the
transaction in the stack.) When a transaction is voided in this way, no
entry for it is written to the message store.

Once a product defined in Reference Data as being non-voidable is added
to the stack, the reversal function is the only method available to cancel
the transaction. If the user tries to void a non-voidable product, the system
displays a message saying that voiding is not allowed. AP transactions
cannot be voided once an amount has been entered and a receipt has
been printed. If, for example, a customer wants the money back, the
transaction must be completed and then reversed.

4.2.4 Swapping between customer sessions

Riposte allows the clerk to start a new customer session before
completing the existing session. The existing session becomes the
swapped session and allows for such situations as the customer needing
to leave the counter to fill up a form before completing a transaction. The
clerk is enabled to serve the next customer and then to revert to the
swapped session when it becomes possible to complete it. No more than
two sessions can be open simultaneously. The clerk is not permitted to log
out if there is an incomplete (swapped) session. When applicable, the
system still invokes a terminal inactivity timeout (see section 4.2.2.2) and
then a forced logout. The forced logout commits the suspended session.

Swapping a customer session is logically similar to transferring a session
(see section 4.2.5). There may be business and technical reasons why
both swapping a session and transferring a session may be prevented, as
described in section 4.2.5. The prohibitions so far identified are concerned
with data integrity, as in the case of AP smart cards, and with volumes of
data, as in the case of the display of large pick lists.

For full details of session swapping, refer to Escher’s Riposte Desktop
Session Management.

4.2.5 Transferring a customer session

The user can transfer a current session to another counter position by
logging on at another terminal. The session transfer function allows the
user to log on at another terminal, without having to log off at a previous
one. Any activities that are being carried out appear on the new system in
exactly the same state as on the previous system.

During a transfer session, the Desktop (Riposte) transfers all the
properties of the OCXs and its own state; the states of variables within the

ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS Ref: TD/STD/004
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

applications also need to be transferred. Two types of data can be
transferred during a session transfer:

e String
e Unindexed Visual Basic collection of strings

To support session transfer, an application obtains a handle to the
TRState object. During session transfer, TRState calls each application
on the transfer-from PC via the SaveState method.

For full details of session transfer, refer to Escher’s Riposte Desktop
Session Management.

Session mobility depends upon the business rules and may be locked for
some sorts of transactions. For example, AP smart card transaction
sessions cannot be transferred, since removing the smart card completes
the transaction and inserting the smart card into another reader starts a
new transaction.

Interfaces for locking and unlocking are as follows:

e The LockUser interface is used to set a lock with user name and an
EventType of ‘TransferLock’.

« The UnlockUser interface is used to clear a lock with user name and
an EventType of ‘Unlock’.

e The CheckUserLock interface is used to find the status of a lock with
user name. Both the LockStatus (0 if unlocked, 1 if locked) and the
actual EventType is returned.

4.2.6 Sending settlement data to Clients

Transaction level reports by stock unit may be printed on Clients’
stationery using the counter printer or, if the physical size or layout of the
stationery demands it, the A4 outlet printer. The reports conform to
POCL’s specification on behalf of the Client and are produced at stock unit
and office level as required.

The agent layer of TMS transforms Riposte messages from the Desktop
into records in the Client Interface table, which are then available to Client
servers. For a general description of this interface, refer to TMS
Architecture Specification. For details of the agent interface, refer to
section 7.

4.3 Stock unit management

The sale of each retail product is recorded as a separate transaction
against a specific user and stock unit. The context that provides this is
established automatically at logon and requires no action by applications.

Stock units are units of accountability that may relate to one individual or
may be shared among a number of clerks, and contain stock: fixed price
stock items, customer- and Client-specific tokens, retail stock items, cash
and transaction vouchers. Each outlet has at least one stock unit.

The number of stock units and their set-up is under the control of the
manager of the outlet, as part of the office administration functions.

4.3.1 Individual and shared stock units

Stock units may be defined as individual or sharable. Individual stock units
allow for a single user at any one time. Sharable stock units may be in use
by more than one user at any one time. In addition, each user is restricted
to using only one stock unit at a time.

Users are always attached to a stock unit. When they are not attached to
a serving stock unit, they are attached to the default stock unit, which
limits the functions available to them.

There is no detach function. The equivalent is to attach to the default
stock unit.

4.3.2 Stock unit balancing

Stock units can be balanced, as often as is required, within a Cash
Account Period. Balancing involves the declaration of stock and cash by
denomination. An office balance is produced at the end of the Cash
Account Period by amalgamating the stock unit balances. The system
provides an office level snapshot, at any time, of transactions, cash and
stock levels, across all stock units. The same facility is available to
provide an instant snapshot of the transactions and contents of any single
stock unit.

For more details of stock unit balancing, see section 4.5.

4.4 Reporting
The interfaces that are available for applications to produce receipts and
reports are as follows:
e Receipts

A receipt generator, available via Cashier, which is supplied with
Escher’s Design Studio product.

e Reports

Visual Basic custom code should be used to produce reports to be
printed on Aé4 office printers.

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

4.4.1 Receipts

Escher’s Design Studio product provides a set of templates and add-ins
for common receipt layout types that can be adapted to the needs of a
particular application. The receipt formats can be saved to the message
store, or locally to a file, using the Build menu in Design Studio. They are
printed using peripherals accessible from a Riposte node. For details of
the Receipt Layout Editor, refer to Escher’s Design Studio Receipt Layout
Editor User's Guide.

4.4.2 Reports

All the reports and receipts produced by the Horizon system are specified
in Horizon OPS Reports and Receipts. For historical reasons EPOSS uses
a dedicated report generator package, which is not available to other
applications and which will not be used in future developments. Other
applications use the generic facilities provided by Riposte’s Peripheral
Broker (see section 5.2 for a summary). Full details are contained in
Riposte Peripheral Broker API Reference Manual in Riposte’s
documentation set.

4.4.3 Cash Account Report

The Cash Account report comprises a set of tables each listing the
accumulated totals of a set of contributing product transactions. The totals
are either value or quantity, or both, depending on the product.

The mechanism used to track and record the transaction data is
Reference Data. Reference Data is organised into a hierarchy of nodes.

Each level is ‘owned’ by POCL or by ICL Pathway. Levels 1 and 2 belong
to POCL, and 3, 4, 5 to ICL Pathway. However, changes to Level 2 may
affect report scripts, so all such changes can only be made in consultation
with ICL Pathway.

Primary Mappings (see section 4.1.4.9) define how the transactions are
summarised in Serve Customer mode.

The Riposte Session Manager handles the transaction stack (as described
in section 4.2.1). When the session is settled by the counter clerk, either
by pressing ‘Finish’ and a suitable method of payment, or by swiping a
card, the total set of transactions for that session is written to the message
store as a single entity. This single entity provides the accumulation of
transactions that are printed on a customer receipt, or session receipt.

The Cash Account Report is compiled after all value product transactions
for each transaction mode for the period have been extracted from the
message store. The sale of a blue game licence, shown in the diagram
above as ‘Serve Customer’ mode, is summarised as part of value Stock
and MoP under the accounting node hierarchy, both as a licence going out
of the outlet, and cash coming into it. In the Cash Account hierarchy, the
licence is reported as contributing to the Total Receipts table, and the
cash as contributing to Value Stock and Vouchers: Table 5 in the Cash
Account Report.

4.5 Stock unit balancing

Within EPOSS there are a several processes, invoked from the Riposte
Desktop, that manage the administration, balancing, and reconciliation of
stock units. These processes track the movement of stock into and out of
the outlet (remittances) and the transfer of stock within the outlet.

Each clerk is attached to a stock unit, which must be balanced, according
to the business rules, by the end of the Cash Account Period (CAP). All
active stock units are balanced and rolled forward into the next Cash
Account Period (CAP); any inactive stock units must be rolled forward into
the next CAP. An inactive stock unit is reactivated and needs to be
balanced if it has been revalued during the CAP.

The Cash Account Period can be extended if necessary, in which case the
Cash Account Period becomes the week number to which it has been
extended and will be out of step with current week number.

The sum of all the stock units’ balances allows the outlet Cash Account to
be derived, by working forward from the last balance. When the balance is
taken and the outlet rolls into the next CAP, the Riposte message store is

marked, and a clean start is made using the brought forward balances.

Horizon OPS Reports and Receipts gives details of the contents of the
Cash Account Report and how it is derived.

Specification. A summary of the information is included in this section,
together with a description of the following components:

e Peripheral Broker Interfaces

e Retail Server and Broker Interfaces
e Desktop Interfaces

e Riposte Functions

5.1 Architecture

Counter applications operate within the framework of Riposte and support
EPOSS. They have access to various common Riposte functions for
recording transaction details, settlement, user access control and session
management.

Counter applications make use of Reference Data to control various
detailed aspects of their operation. Reference Data is distributed from a
central services Reference Data Management Centre (RDMC). The data is
stored as persistent message data within the message stores on each
counter PC at each outlet, where it is accessible to applications using the
normal message store API.

5.2 The Peripheral Broker

The Peripheral Broker (also known as the Peripheral Server) provides a
common OLE interface to all Riposte applications. It supports the use of
input and output devices and manages spooling and queuing. The
Peripheral Broker hides the details of the interfaces to all peripherals
connected to the counter PCs, and yet makes the facilities of these
available to all terminals.

The peripherals supported include:
e Bar-code readers
e Magnetic card stripe reader

e Smart card reader/encoder (via the SmartMan interface: refer to
section 5.2.4)

« Scales

Scales are shared between terminals, although each has its own direct
connection (for more details of the Scales interface, refer to OPS
Architecture Specification).

« Touch screen

e Counter printers (printing on A4 printers is controlled by standard NT
services)

Desktop applications make use of a Peripheral Broker API to obtain input
and direct output, without needing to know about the capabilities of
individual devices. If changes are made to the configuration of devices
supported by the Desktop, the Desktop must be restarted (see also
section 6.3.4).

The overall architecture is shown in Figure 5-2.

Figure 5-2 Peripheral Broker architecture

The Peripheral Broker supports the following features of the Riposte
Desktop:

e Aninput event, such as a bar-code scan, can activate an application
automatically.

e Riposte applications can share input and output devices transparently
across the network.

e Aninput event can be sent to multiple applications simultaneously,
allowing the first available operator to manage the transaction. For
example, if two counters share a set of scales, the placement of a
package on the scales can be handled by either counter position,
depending on which is available.

e Output to printers can be precisely laid out and previewed on-line
using an HTML browser.

e tis possible to queue output to A4 printers asynchronously, so that
applications are available for continued use.

ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS Ref: TD/STD/004
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

There are primarily two functions that the Peripheral Broker provides for
user applications:

e  It accepts and routes input events from a number of attached input
devices.

e It processes data to be written to devices such as printers or smart
cards.

The Peripheral Broker's functions are described in detail in Escher’s
Riposte Peripheral Broker API Reference Manual. The names of the
methods described in this manual are, in most cases, the same as the
Riposte 32 API function with the word ‘Riposte’ removed; exceptions are
listed in the manual. This manual identifies those calls that have been
superseded and gives guidance on the methods to use.

5.2.1 Peripheral Broker output

The following sequence of methods is used within applications to ensure
that standard output jobs are handled correctly (for a description of the
methods used, see Table 5-1):

1. BeginJob is called to create a job entry in the Peripheral Broker. This
method returns the job ID that must be passed in all subsequent calls
to the Peripheral Broker. The BeginJob method takes a number of
parameters, including the Application Callback Object, the application's
name, the job type (which is used to assign the correct device to the
job), or the specific device name, and finally whether the job is to be
synchronous or asynchronous.

2. For every line of data to be sent to the output device, the WriteData
method of the Peripheral Broker is called, passing it the unique job ID
returned from the BeginJob method.

3. When all the data has been sent to the output device using the
WriteData method, the EndJob method is called, using the unique job
ID returned from the BeginJob method.

5.2.1.1 Error handling

If an error occurs during processing of an output job, an application may
be notified as follows:

e If the job is asynchronous, a call is made to the application’s
DeviceErrorHandler method. The call includes the error details.

e If the job is synchronous, the return value of each function call to the
Peripheral Server must be checked for the value ‘False’. If an error
occurs, a call to the ErrorDescription property of the Peripheral
Server returns the error that occurred.

Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

If an error occurs, the current job can be cancelled using CancelJob, or
started again at the exact point where the error occurred using
ResumeJob. Table 5-1 gives details of these methods.

5.2.2 Peripheral Broker input

The Peripheral Broker monitors input devices for data and routes data to
the correct application. When data is read from one of the input devices,
the Peripheral Broker first passes that raw data to the Validation Object
(see section 4.1.5.10), which matches it to a token definition that has been
registered with it by the application. The Validation Object will then return
the event name and the raw data in a parsed form to the Peripheral Broker
(for further details of the Validation Object, refer to Escher’s Riposte
Validation Object Developer’s Guide). The Peripheral Broker also
searches its list of registered events for a match. Once found, the
application associated with that event is sent the data via the application's
Callinterface.

So that the Peripheral Broker can associate data with a particular
application, the application must register information about the event as
follows:

e Register the event’s data and its format with the Validation Object.

e Register the event's name and pass its call-back object to the
Peripheral Broker via the RegisterEvents method.

5.2.3 Peripheral Broker interfaces

This section briefly describes the programming interface of the Peripheral
Broker DLL object. For full details of this interface, refer to Escher’s
documentation Riposte Peripheral Broker API Reference Manual.

The Peripheral Broker's methods and properties are accessed by using
the EGPeripheralBrokerLib external type library interface. Object
methods in this library accept as arguments both values, and attribute
grammar messages supplied by applications.

The Peripheral Broker also implements the EGBroker interface, which is
described in section 5.3.

The objects listed in Table 5-1 reside in the EGPeripheralBrokerLib type
library.

5.2.4 Smart card system architecture and Interfaces

The software functions that support the handling of smart cards consist of
a number of layers as shown in Figure 5-3:

Application Layer ‘SmartCard Manager
(eg APS)

ISmartCard and ISmartMan Interfaces Layer

‘SmartCard ‘SmartCard ‘SmartCard ‘SmartCard

Figure 5-3 Smart card architecture

Smart Card Manager handles the result of all smart card impulses. It is
responsible for identifying the CardDLL associated with the inserted card
and notifying any interested application that an impulse has been
received. The Smart Card Manager software acts as a buffer between the
smart card reader, the Peripheral Server, the application and the
CardDLL.

The Smart Card Manager, SmartMan, provides the technology-
independent functions common to all card types such as retrieval of
Reference Data definitions and access to the smart card itself.

The technology-dependent DLLs perform those functions that are specific
to a particular type of card, such as updating credit details, extracting
meter readings and encryption. There is an interface defined for
ISmartCard that must be implemented by each CardDLL. Each CardDLL
communicates with SmartMan through a separate ISmartMan interface.

The application level interfaces cover:

e Identification of the CardDLL.

e Identification of the Card Technology.
e Identification of the Token Types.

e Definition of the action to be taken by the clerk. This may be to
abandon the transaction.

The definition of these interfaces are given in Appendix A, SmartMan
Interfaces.

5.3 The Retail Broker

The Retail Broker co-ordinates the various applications in terms of a
customer session and adds contextual information, such as stock unit
names, to messages. It supports the concept of a mode and may make
certain Desktop functions unavailable; for example, the Logout function is
not available while the counter PC is in Serve Customer mode.

This section lists the interfaces that are available to add the sale of a
product as a transaction to the stack, to cancel transactions, and to deal
with any additional processing required at the point when a session is
settled. It includes others used to access the message store for other
reasons: scanning, writing, and manipulating persistent objects.

The Retail Broker object implements three interfaces:
« EGBroker

EGBroker is an abstract class that is implemented within each broker.
Its implementation is specific to each broker. It provides mechanisms to
initialise, terminate and check the initialisation status of objects.

e EGRetailBroker

EGRetailBroker is an interface that provides mechanisms for
managing transactions as they are written to the message store.

e EGRetailBrokerClient

EGRetailBrokerClient is an interface that provides the mechanism for
settling transactions and for writing the transaction details to the
message store. It assigns a user-defined transaction type and a unique
transaction key to each transaction.

The Connect method lets an application connect to an instance of the
Riposte Broker. It must be called first in an application before any other
Riposte Broker method can be called.

5.3.1 Retail Broker interfaces
Table 5-2 lists the Retail Broker Library interfaces.

5.4 Desktop interfaces

The desktop interface is populated using a standard set of OCXs, which
ensures that its consistent appearance and behaviour is maintained.
OCXs are provided for application developers to use in building their
applications; they are not accessed directly, but via the Desktop, using
Riposte scripts. This restricts developers to the Riposte OCX collection
and rules out the common Visual Basic development practice of using
custom-designed OCXs. It is possible to modify an existing OCX by
specifying different values for some of it is attributes such as panel style
and field length.

A number of standard OCX actions control common features of the
Desktop:

e Desktop Button

The Desktop Button moves the user back to the main menu (for the
current mode).

ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS Ref: TD/STD/004
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

e Prev Button

The Prev(ious) Button returns the user to the next screen up in the
hierarchy, either the menu screen from which the transaction was
selected, or the previous transaction screen in the case of an
application that has a dialogue with the user.

¢ Bin Button

The Bin Button takes the user into ‘Remove Mode’. If it is allowed
under the application's rules, an item subsequently selected can be
removed (from the stack).

¢ Info Button

The Info Button takes the user into ‘Help Mode’. (Help for some OCXs
is completely managed by the Desktop.) Note that Escher’s HTML
help, indicated by the ® symbol, is not implemented in the Horizon
system; because of the complexity of counter procedures, help is
provided in a set of documents that is available to all counter clerks.
The use of HTML help has performance implications, which are
discussed in Appendix C, System Management.

Application developers select the OCXs that are appropriate for each
application, via scripts and screen dialogues, and Riposte controls others
that maintain the consistent behaviour and appearance of the Desktop.
The available OCX types are as follows:

¢ The Calendar and Clock OCX displays the date and time in the stack
estate when the stack does not contain any transactions. Application
developers cannot specify its use, as it is entirely controlled by Riposte.

e The Help OCX provides information about any screen object that the
user selects. Information is displayed in a speech bubble with a yellow
background. Application developers supply the text and the Help OCX
controls how and where on the screen it is displayed.

e Card and Button OCXs are used to offer options to the user. The Card
OCX is a simple button that the user touches to make a selection. A
Button OCX has an identical function but has a more complicated
format with a tabbed caption.

e The Trans OCX is used for all panels that display information to the
user, but cannot be altered or selected. It is normally displayed with a
Card OCX to enable the user to react to the displayed information.

e The Script OCX is a panel that tells the user what data to enter and how
to proceed. It is always displayed with one of the input OCX types:
Calculator, Options or Message/Error.

e The Calculator OCX is a standard display format used to enter
alphanumeric data.

« The Options OCX enables the user to make a selection from a list of
alternatives.

« The Message/Error OCX gives information about a transaction or an
error, and offers one or two courses of action.

e The List OCX provides a structured list format with navigation and
search facilities. It has a number of uses, including the provision of
Product Look-Up and Declaration lists.

Other aspects of the design of the man-machine interface (MMI) are
described in the Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide.

5.5 Riposte functions

Riposte supports a number of message-handling APIs that are
implemented via Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanisms. They
support natural C or C++ interfaces to a local or remote application.
Functions are implemented as OCXs that can be multi-threaded within the
Windows NT environment and which support Visual Basic error-handing
mechanisms so that they can be used by desktop applications that are
coded in Visual Basic.

There are three layers of APIs:

e The Message Layer, which includes standard facilities for creating and
manipulating messages.

« The Persistent Object Layer, which includes additional facilities for
creating, updating, searching for and selecting persistent objects.

e The Reference Data Layer, which provides additional facilities to select
records that are effective and applicable to the caller. Reference Data
is a particular example of persistent objects, and is used to pass
parameters to applications and to make applications aware of changing
data. Reference Data messages can be created with an ‘effective date’
in the future, and the Reference Data interface, if called in an outlet,
will not return the record until that date. Similarly, some Reference
Data is only applicable to some outlets (for example, not all outlets sell
Vehicle Excise Licences). Data is only returned if it is relevant.

The three layers are shown in Figure 5-3. An implication of this diagram is
that Reference Data is accessible through the persistent object APIs as
well as its own APIs, and everything is accessible via the Messaging APIs.

5.5.1 Messages

All information used by Riposte is held as messages in attribute grammar
format (see section 4.1.2.1). Most messages are created as a
consequence of information being passed down to counter applications, or
as a result of customer transactions at the counter. The methods that are
available for generating and retrieving messages, some of which are
referred to in this section, are documented in Escher’s Riposte Broker API
Reference Manual.

5.5.1.1 Replication

Messages contained in the message store of any counter PC are
replicated to all other counter PC nodes within the outlet and to the central
Correspondence Servers. Data replication into and from this local
message store is essentially transparent to local applications running on
the counter PC, which access the message store using the Riposte API to
create, retrieve or parse messages independently of any replication
activity.

5.5.1.2 Message types
Messages are used for the following purposes:
« Transactions

When a customer transaction is committed, a set of messages is
written to the message store. If a system failure occurs before the
transaction is committed, any messages created within the transaction
are rolled back.

e Enquiries and responses

For example, a request for messages that satisfies a set of criteria (see
also section 5.5.1.5 for information about ports).

e Audit and monitoring information
« Authorisations and instructions
For example, OBCS foreign encashment authorisation.
« To define the text of instructions to counter clerks.
¢ To maintain a session context
«e To record system events such as a user login or use of a card.

All messages have a unique message ID and record the group at which it
was created and the node within the group. The group is derived from the
Financial Accounting Division (FAD) code by dropping the check digit
character. The node is the machine number within the group, and
sequence number is within that node. Riposte does not store a message it
receives from another node unless it has the preceding message from that
node. If it has not, it requests the missing messages from the other node.

Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

5.5.1.3 Markers

The sequence number field within a message identifies its position in the
sequence of messages generated by that system. Although there is no
relationship between the sequence number fields of messages from
different systems, Riposte supports the concept of a marker. A marker is a
string that holds a series of the latest sequence numbers for each system
in the group, so it is possible to state that a particular message precedes
or follows a given marker.

Markers can be used to delineate a cut-off point for a set of messages. For
example, when it is necessary to balance the outlet at the end of the day,
a marker can be used to decide which messages are balanced, and which
are held over to the next day.

Markers are also used by Riposte to co-ordinate message stores in the
event of failures.

5.5.1.4 Checkpoints

Checkpoints apply to a whole message store (to all Correspondence
servers in a cluster) and are used by Agents to control the recovery of
information after a failure. Refer to TMS Architecture Specification for
information about clusters

5.5.1.5 Message ports

If a counter application creates a message that contains an enquiry or
update, it creates a message port waiting for a response, using the key of
the message ID of the enquiry or update. The message port is set to time
out after a time specified by a configuration parameter set in a persistent
object.

Real Time Message Ports may be used by Agents to ensure that priority
messages can be processed immediately by the message port, without
waiting for the message to arrive in sequence. Note that delivery through a
Real Time Message Port cannot be guaranteed, and duplicates may also
arise under certain recovery scenarios.

5.5.2 Persistent objects

Persistent objects provide a means of permanent storage of standard
values and other data. They have additional properties over and above
normal messages, of which the two most important are:

e The content of a persistent object can be changed by the creation of a
new version; Riposte always returns the latest version.

e The latest version of a persistent object is never purged. Earlier
versions are purged on the same basis as normal messages.

ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS Ref: TD/STD/004
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

For details of the structure of persistent objects, refer to section 4.1.4. It
should be noted that persistent objects are used only for Reference Data
or for messages to the clerk.

Use of persistent objects for any other reason can have significant
performance implications. The rules that define their usage and the way
performance implications are defined and modelled are stated in Appendix
C, System Management.

5.5.2.1 Persistent object collections

Persistent object collections provide a means of grouping like persistent
objects together. The persistent object store corresponds in many ways to
a database table. The collection name corresponds to a table name, and
the object name to a prime key. Where more than one message has the
same collection name and object name, the one with the highest version
number is returned, unless the ‘deleted’ flag is set in the highest-
numbered version, in which case no record is returned.

5.5.2.2 Reference Data

The counter applications are heavily dependent on Reference Data
needed to instantiate them and to feed other components of the system
with information generated by POCL or its Clients.

Reference Data is stored within Riposte as persistent objects. Each item of
Reference Data has an effective date associated with it, which allows the
data to be downloaded to the counters before it is needed, and to become
available automatically on the effective date. The data is not read directly
from the persistent objects by the counter applications. Instead, there is an
effective date algorithm that is used to provide the calling counter
application with the appropriate value for the Reference Data it requires,
based on today’s date.

Business Reference Data (Type A and Type B Reference Data) becomes
available whenever it is read by an application on the effective date; all
times used are GMT. For Client Reference Data the same applies.
Implementation Reference Data (Type C and Type D Reference Data)
becomes active on the effective date, the first time the Desktop is loaded
on that day.

5.5.3 Message-handling interfaces

The Riposte Broker provides methods to retrieve messages, to parse
messages, and retrieve attribute names and values. Similarly, there are
methods to enable an application developer to construct a Riposte
message and define its attributes. (Refer to section 4.1.2.1 fora
description of attribute grammar structures.) The following sections group
the methods according to their use and give a brief description of each.
For full details of these and for additional methods, refer to Escher’s
Riposte Broker API Reference Manual.

6 Other Functions
This section describes the interfaces that support the following features of
the system:
e Administration
e Security
e Availability
e Usability
e Performance
¢ Resilience

6.1 Administration

6.1.1 User administration

The functions that are available for managing users and security are as
supplied by Riposte, and are not configurable by individual applications.

Riposte provides facilities for users in outlets who have the system role
‘Manager’ to define users, to change their passwords, and to delete users.
Other facilities enable the manager to specify:

e That a password must be changed when a user next logs on
e Auser’s roles

A user can have one or more than one role. The functions available on the
menus to a particular user are determined by the access rights available
to the role(s) selected. Users who have more than one role on the system,
have all the access rights that are defined for each of those roles.

The system supports the following roles, known as ‘user groups’:
e« ENGINEER: This role has only a hardware diagnostic capability.

e AUDITOR: This role gives access to the limited functionality that
supports the auditing process.

e AUDITOR E: This role has full manager rights, and is only used in
emergency situations if another employee needs to take over the post
office.

e SUPPORT: This role has only administrative functionality to create
users. For instance, it is used if a manager forgets his or her password.

« MANAGERS: This role allows all access to all functions. User
administration is restricted to this group.

« SUPERVISORS: This role has access to all counter and some
administrative functionality.

e CLERK: This role has access to all the counter functionality.

e SETUP: This role operates only on initialisation of the system. The only
rights this group has are administrative ones in order to create a
manager user. Once this has been completed, the group must be
deleted.

Groups not appropriate to outlet users (MIGRATE, ENGINEER,
AUDITOR, AUDITOR E, SUPPORT and SETUP) cannot be allocated to
new or existing users. These roles can be assigned only by the system
start-up process for agreed user names.

6.2 Security

System security is achieved in a number of ways:
e By controlling access to desktop menus and applications
e By the use of encryption

e By the use of digital signatures

6.2.1 Users

Access to the Horizon desktop is controlled by the user administration
functions described in section 6.1.

6.2.2 Menus and applications

Part of the data held within Reference Data defines the mappings from
buttons or impulses to applications and to counter users. It also
determines which component of the application handles the button or
impulse. Not all applications and their associated buttons and impulses
are available to all users. Some are reserved to the outlet manager and
others to auditors. The access controls must be defined and set up as part
of the application design. They include the user-to-application privileges
associated with each of the user groups. New applications need to define
their own controls.

6.2.2.1 Access Control Lists

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are defined, like everything else in Riposte, in
an attribute grammar syntax (see Appendix C, System Management).
They provide an ‘allowed list’ and a ‘denied list’, with the latter taking
precedence.

Some messages (or parts of messages) need to be signed. The Access
Controls define which these are, and also allow the application to verify
the signature on signed messages that it receives.

6.2.2.2 The MenuSecurity collection

The MenuSecurity collection in Riposte Reference Data defines each
menu in terms of user access; each button on a menu may be specified
separately for access purposes, or the same access rights may apply to
an entire menu screen.

Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

6.2.3 Digital signing

For integrity-critical products, such as APS, standard simple public key
technology is used for digital signing.

Under public key technology, protected messages are digitally signed by a
private key and validated using the private key’s matching public key.

Transactions are digitally signed at the post office and then signature-
verified at the harvesting agent that takes the transactions from the
correspondence servers, or vice versa. Complete files of transactions are
signed before transmission to Client hosts.

Applications and agents use cryptographic functions in order to sign,
verify, encrypt or decrypt data or files. The cryptographic functions shield
the application from requiring knowledge of the Key Management
Service’s (KMS) managed keys used to perform these operations. For
details of the functions available for cryptographic operations, refer to
Appendix B, Cryptography and Key Management.

The harvester or application verifies that the data in each transaction is
valid by checking the digital signature added by the counter. Any invalid
transactions generate an error event in the NT Event Log. These failing
transactions are investigated manually.

6.3 Availability

Optimum availability is achieved through a combination of factors:
e Reliable components, both hardware and software.

e Detectable failures, so that a failed component is immediately detected
and notified to the support organisation.

e Resilience, so that major components are replicated or include retries
and error processing to minimise the impact of failure.

e Recovery and repair processes that can restore a failed component or
system to normal operation speedily.

e Distribution, installation and activation processes that can be used to
install and configure components remotely to fix an identified problem,
or to minimise the disruption when a key component is out of service.

e Measurement techniques that may be used to determine the overall
availability of the services provided by the information system and
whether these conform to agreed service levels.

The availability requirements for the Horizon system are specified in a
number of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The Horizon system is
required to be available to the clerk for normal counter operations during
working hours. It also runs a number of unrelated applications that have to
be scheduled in such a way that they allow ICL Pathway to keep within the

terms of the Service Level Agreements and so that they do not interfere
with each other.

6.3.1 End of Day

Applications that produce external data need to be synchronised in their
view of ‘End of Day’. If this is not achieved, reconciliation processes
between external bodies will throw up anomalies. End of Day in this
context means the identification of the transactions that count as
belonging to the current day’s transactions and those that will be included
in tomorrow's.

End of Day is indicated by the arrival of an End of Day (EoD) marker for
each outlet. However, the production of an End of Day (EoD) marker is
derived from POCL outlet Reference Data that defines the opening and
closing times of each outlet. If the outlet opens on a particular day, the
time at which the processing of EoD is initiated, and the marker written, is
set to closing time plus 30 minutes, unless this would result in a time later
than 7pm, in which case 7pm is used. If the outlet does not open on a
particular day, EoD processing is initiated at 7pm.

The operation here is driven by the requirement that the same data is sent
to all Clients and POCL via TIP. Where an outlet does not report End of
Day by the time the latest time for this signal, no data is sent to any Client
or TIP. If a counter is offline, the End of Day processing does not occur.

A generic harvester reads these EoD markers. For each one that it
receives, it updates a persistent object in a virtual group that is used to
delineate which outlets may be harvested for the day. All other harvesters
only harvest messages from outlets that are recorded within the virtual
group.

The EoD marker is written to the mainstream message store, rather than
to the active message store (which may be the training one). There are
two types of EoD marker, private and public. It is the public markers that
are used for harvesting. Each counter position creates its own private EoD
marker and it is the responsibility of the Gateway terminal to create the
public marker and mediate between private markers in recovery situations.
If a counter position is unavailable at End of Day, the EoD marker is
created when the position becomes available again. One EoD marker is
written for each ‘missing’ day.

Transactions added to the message store after the EoD marker has been
written to it appear as ‘tomorrow’s’ rather than ‘today’s’ transactions in TIP.

6.3.2 Disconnection

6.3.2.1 Disconnected outlets

If an outlet becomes disconnected because of a communications failure, it
can continue to be used for the majority of applications. Some transactions

© 2000 ICL Pathway Limited COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Page: 134 of 173
FUJ00001368

FUJ00001368
ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS Ref: TD/STD/004
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

cannot be performed because of particular business rules. Transactions
that require on-line queries or verification can be performed by using a
Helpdesk telephone connection. When the communications link is
restored, Riposte updates the correspondence server with all the
messages that have been written to the message store since the last
connection was made.

The rules about which transactions can be conducted when there is a
communications failure are business-specific.

6.3.2.2 Disconnected counters

Many outlets contain multiple counter systems, and so the loss of one (for
example through power supply failure) does not prevent the use of other
counters.

Riposte ensures that transactions completed at a counter are replicated
both on the other counter PCs within the outlet, and on a number of
correspondence servers in the data centres. It provides for automatic
recovery of transaction data. If a counter PC fails, its transaction can be
completed at another counter PC within the outlet.

An application can determine the status of all nodes that belong to the
group by use of two Retail Broker commands:

e NextNode makes it possible to establish all the neighbours in a group.

e GetConnections makes it possible to establish whether or not any
data has been received from a node within two Riposte marker
exchange periods. Exchanging markers is the method used by Riposte
to synchronise neighbours.

The rules about which transactions can be conducted when the counter is
disconnected are business-specific.

6.3.3 Reboot

The POLO process is invoked to unlock the counter PC's filestore during
its boot process. Most of these services will fail if they run on a locked
filestore, and so they cannot be started automatically by Windows NT.
Instead, they are defined as ‘started manually’, and it is the POLO process
that starts them. They are recorded in a registry entry that is read by
POLO. This mechanism ensures that no user-accessible desktop functions
can run until the Post Office Manager has successfully executed a POLO
process.

6.3.4 Reload

In the Horizon environment, Windows NT reloads the Riposte Desktop
overnight. If the counter is in use, the reload is postponed. This reload is
necessary to ensure that new versions of persistent objects are picked up.

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

The persistent objects are used to configure some applications, and to
specify the menu buttons and their meanings.

A utility called PathwayLoad is used to start (and stop) the Riposte
Desktop. When it is necessary to update the restartable software on any
counter PC overnight, the following sequence is automatically executed:

¢ Call PathwayLoad to close down the desktop (it uses APIs provided by
Riposte)

e Shut down the Riposte-related services

e Shut down the Riposte Message Server(s)
« Update the necessary software

e Restart the Riposte Message Service(s)

e Restart the Riposte related services

¢ Call PathwayLoad to start the desktop

6.4 Usability

The different functionality of the component Horizon applications is
blended into a single user interface, where consistency is achieved
through using the defined set of facilities provided by the Riposte
software. Certain conventions ensure that similar actions performed in
different applications produce similar effects. For example, a numeric
value that is entered incorrectly produces an error message worded
similarly and in the same position on the screen, whether it is the sale of a
stamp or the payment of a savings account withdrawal.

The system must be intuitive and discoverable to the user. Intuitive in this
sense means that without guidance the user can deduce from the system’s
responses what to do next. Discoverable means that where any action is
not obvious, it can be deduced. In neither case should the user be led to
an irrecoverable position.

In order to achieve this, the following guidelines are followed:

e The system identifies at each point in a dialogue all the options open to
the user. This is achieved using a combination of displayed
instructions and prompts in text and pictorial form.

e Similar user interface styles are used in similar situations.
e Users have options available that enable them to change their minds.

e Prompts only require confirmation when the next action cannot be
undone.

The Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide defines the interface
standards as described in the following sections.

6.4.1 Screen types
The screens within the Horizon system are of three main kinds:
e Menu screens from which to navigate to the required function or task.
e Transaction screens to input data or perform a specific task.
e Report screens for selecting, previewing and printing reports.

The menu screens present the user with a maximum of sixteen buttons (in
addition to navigation buttons) with which to select products, applications
and lower-level menus.

The transaction screens present a combination of buttons, information
panels and data input panels.

The buttons that enable the user to choose an option or take a particular
action are activated via the touch-sensitive screen or the keyboard. The
data input panels allow the entry of data using the on-screen keypad or

© 2000 ICL Pathway Limited COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Page: 137 of 173
FUJ00001368

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

the keyboard, and the information panels give instructions to the user and
information about the status of the transaction. Some applications may
also be activated by swiping a magnetic card or via a bar-code reader.

The consistency of the appearance of both menu and transaction screens
is controlled by the use of the standard Riposte Desktop application
interface.

The elements of screen layout that it controls are as follows:
« The shape and position of navigation and function buttons.
e The shape and position of the buttons on menu screens.

e The shape and position of data and information panels on input
screens.

The following aspects can be varied under the control of the application
programmer:

e The types of panels and buttons that are used.
e Particular effects using text colour and non-default panels.
Global visual attributes such as background colour are system-wide and
are not under the control of application programmers.
6.4.2 Desktop components

The Desktop is laid out using a number of buttons, panels and scripts,
which are assembled into named software component types known as
OCXs. Some of these types are entirely under the control of the Riposte
software and others are available to programmers to use in their
applications.

6.4.3 Panel and button styles

Each OCX type has a number of different properties, including the style of
the panels and buttons that are used and the text that is displayed on
them.

Panel and button styles used by the Desktop are either as supplied by the
Riposte Desktop application interface or are customised versions of them.
6.4.4 Data types

Within the Horizon system, data input is handled by Riposte. Formats
remain consistent, irrespective of the source of the data.

Depending upon the task, data can be input using one or more of three
methods:

e Using a scanning device such as a bar-code reader, smart card reader
or a magnetic card swipe.

« Selecting options using the touch-sensitive screen.

FUJ00001368

ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS Ref: TD/STD/004
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

e Using the keyboard.

6.4.5 Navigation

Navigation between screens is achieved by selecting an item from a menu
or by using general navigation facilities to skip menu levels or return to a
specific level. The options depend upon what mode the user is in. In
‘Serve Customer’ mode, for example, the user is returned to the ‘Serve
Customer’ menu when the Home key is selected. In other modes, the user
may be returned to the ‘Transactions’ menu.

External impulses such as bar-code scans navigate to the correct screen
for processing the input. For example, if the bar-code of a Child Benefit
order book is scanned, the appropriate transaction screen is displayed.

General navigation facilities are provided by the Riposte Desktop
application interface. The application programmer, however, can modify
navigation requests within an application by trapping them and processing
them as necessary.

6.4.6 Functions

Among the generalised controls that are provided are a ‘Bin’ facility that
enables the user to remove a transaction from the stack if the business
rules allow it, and a ‘Suspend’ facility that suspends the current customer
session so that a new one may be started.

6.4.7 Menus

Menu screens are used as a means of offering the user a set of options.
The user selects an option and is then presented with a screen for
performing a task, or with a further menu screen from which to make a
selection.

Riposte controls the overall appearance of menus and the absolute
positions of the buttons. The application interface enables the programmer
to specify the relative position of each option button so that they can be
arranged in a way that is most convenient for the user.

6.4.8 Messages and help text

Information and error messages are handled in a consistent way using the
Message/Error OCX. A number of guidelines are defined in Horizon Office
Platform Service Style Guide for the consistency of messages.

6.4.9 Icons and colour

Icons are used to assist in the rapid identification of products and
functions, as well as adding to the visual appeal of the Desktop.

Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

Guidelines are provided in Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide for
the design of icons and for the use of colour in icons, backdrops, panels,
buttons and scripts.

6.4.10 Reports and Receipts

The designs of reports, till receipts and slips, depend on their contents
and usage as well as the stationery on which they are printed. Current
definitions are included in OPS Reports and Receipts. The Horizon Office
Platform Service Style Guide describes the style generally adopted for
reports and receipts.

6.5 Performance

Performance is a measure of the rate at which a system is able to perform
useful work, its throughput and the responsiveness with which the results
are presented. There are a number of factors to be considered when
designing new applications, in order to minimise the impact on the existing
OPS application services.

6.5.1 Service Level Agreements

As for availability, performance criteria are specified in a series of Service
Level Agreements (SLAs). The three main areas covered by SLAs for
performance are illustrated in the following examples:

e On-Line Transactions

A complex set of maximum transaction times is defined. They range
between 20 and 33 seconds, depending on the type of transaction.

e Transaction Information Processing

Files must be delivered to POCL’s Transaction Information Processing
Application (TIP), which handles transaction data returned from
Horizon, by 03:00 on the day following that to which they refer.

e Reference Data

Reference Data that is authorised and delivered to ICL Pathway by
20:00 on a particular day (day 1) must be available to the following
percentages of outlets by the start of core days 2, 3 and 4 as follows:

Type \Day 2 Day 3 Day 4
IMMEDIATE 7% 09% (100%
ADVANCE b 9% (100%

6.5.2 Performance monitoring and measurement

Monitoring mechanisms allow performance parameters and volumetric
data to be extracted. They vary from platform to platform. Where it is
possible to monitor behaviour against predetermined thresholds, any
instances in which the thresholds of key measurements are exceeded, are
notified as events to the Tivoli Systems Management software.

Various monitoring mechanisms are available as follows:
« Windows NT

Use is made of the Windows NT Performance Monitor. This is
especially useful in measuring the performance of the Riposte system
on counter systems and correspondence servers.

e Riposte

All messages generated by Riposte are time-stamped. As well as
helping with message synchronisation, these timestamps are gathered
by the Data Warehouse and are used to check ICL Pathway’s
conformance to the agreed SLAs. Riposte itself maintains over 100
statistics that can be accessed via the Windows NT Performance
Monitor.

6.5.3 Performance modelling

The loading on all the key components of the system are modelled by ICL
Pathway as the workload grows and as new services come on-line. This is
achieved by the construction of a resource model that predicts future
component loadings based on volumetric information and system
performance parameters.

The output from this model is fed into the design and development
processes and helps to identify where performance shortfalls are likely to
occur. Early warning of performance issues is necessary to enable
designers and implementers to review and modify designs and
implementations (where appropriate) or to recommend changes to the
system configuration before performance is endangered.

The model's algorithms can be tested by comparing the predictions, once
calibrated, with the system's real behaviour.

A number of performance models are used and focus on components of
the system that are heavily used, or where there is a requirement to
process on-line or batch workloads within the SLA constraints.

A sizing activity estimates the resources required to process each of the
main workload components. The resource loading is generated by
applying the resource estimates to the throughput model. The model can
be used to identify performance deficiencies within the system. It can also
be used to evaluate alternative solutions.

A system model is used to link together the component resource models
and to allow the impact of one component on another to be assessed. It
enables questions about the effect of changes in transaction mix and
volumes to be answered across the system.

The volume of counter and batch transactions to be generated by a new
business application must be forecast accurately so that its effect on
system loading and throughput can be assessed before development is
started.

Designers are required to provide information about new applications to
ICL Pathway. ICL Pathway can then model and assess the application’s
impact.

6.6 Resilience

6.6.1 Message replication

Riposte ensures that transactions completed at a counter are replicated
both on the other counter PCs within the outlet, and on a number of
correspondence servers in the campuses. It provides for automatic
recovery of transaction data. If a counter PC fails, its transaction can be
completed at another counter PC within the outlet.

6.6.2 Agent managing of message recovery

Agents are responsible for managing recovery and message
re-synchronisation between the host layer and the counter layer following
a failure.

Riposte contains transaction features that allow multiple messages to be
committed as one atomic unit. These ensure that messages are replicated
as a unit, and another processor cannot read one message in the
message run until all the messages in it have been replicated to that
processor.

Equivalent facilities are available at the host layer within SQL, and must
be designed into other application types as appropriate.

Bulk agents must mark their work chunks as ‘in progress’ as soon as they
start to process them. If the agent fails, it is detected by a bulk monitor
running on the host central server. The bulk monitor initiates a recovery
process that recovers the failed work chunks.

Enquiry agents and interactive agents run as Windows NT Services.
Failure of one of these is detected by the Tivoli Systems Management
software which then restarts the agent.

The general strategy towards message recovery is:

duplicate them.

7 Agent Interfaces

This section describes the generic structure of agents used by ICL
Pathway and the constraints that must be recognised in the design of their
interfaces. It is recommended that all agents follow this strategy.

7.1 Introduction to agents

A new application is likely to need a new agent component to extract the
transaction data it needs for a Client. Agents are unique to applications
and do not interact with agents belonging to other applications. The
structure of agents is shown in Figure 7-1.

Figure 7-1 Agent structure

Agents are responsible for transforming the format of transaction data
messages between that required by the Host and that required by the
counter application. The transformation can take place in both directions.

Riposte holds the data in ‘unnormalised’, attribute grammar format,
whereas the Host application can hold the data in a variety of formats,
commonly as database tables, such as Oracle, or flat file structure.

Figure 7-2 shows the relationship between data associated with a banking

Agents can process messages either individually, or in bulk. Agents are
therefore designed specifically to use either one method or the other.

Typically, agents are written in C.

7.1.1 Flat File format

For the purposes of this document, a flat file is one that is manipulated by
a File Management Service, such as NTFS in Windows NT, as opposed to
a database that is manipulated by a database management system such
as Oracle. ICL Pathway normally expects that flat files be encoded using
ISO 8859-1.

The format of flat files may be dictated by other suppliers, such as
Microsoft. If the files are under the control of ICL Pathway, it advised that:

« Files include both a header and a trailer.

e Files include a record count, and sub-record counts, where
appropriate.

7.2 Types of agents

Agents are grouped in three categories:

e Bulk agents: Inbound or harvester, and outbound or loader. Bulk
agents process bulk messages or records.

e Interactive agents: Inbound or harvester, and outbound or loader.
These process single messages or records (events).

e Enquiry agents: These process messages requiring authorisation or
acceptability.

The structure of agents depends on whether or not the Host application
uses an SQL database, as this interposes SQL client and server
components into the data path. Such components are not present in the
Flat File model.

There are also agents that ICL Pathway uses to manage aspects of
messages, such as the General Acknowledgement Agent, described
below.

Note: In the diagrams in this section solid lines indicate the flow of data,
while the broken lines indicate a call.

7.2.1 General Acknowledgement Agent
The General Acknowledgement Agent serves two purposes:

¢ It demonstrates the success and timeliness of the arrival of data from
the Data Centre to the counter.

e  Itcan trigger an additional process if a message does not reach its
destination within a predefined period of time.

As shown in the diagram below, there are two variants of this agent:
e On one of the counter PCs at an outlet

This acknowledges the receipt of regular data, including Reference
Data, from the Correspondence Server in the Data Centre.

e Inthe Data Centre
This acknowledges the receipt of messages from the counters.

The messages issued by these variants of the General Acknowledgement

Agent are shown in the following table:

The set of messages handled can be extended, and the way they are
handled can be tailored. There is a standard persistent object for each
message type; and default handling styles for particular message types.

Bulk agents

Bulk agents operate on all messages of any specified type held in the

Riposte message store.

7.2.2.1 Bulk harvester agents

These have similar structure to the interactive harvester agents, but they
are started by a scheduler (Maestro) to harvest all the messages that have
accumulated in the Riposte message store, rather than waiting on a
message port for the arrival of a message and processing it as soon as it
arrives.

Bulk harvesters run at defined periods, depending on a combination of
performance requirements, SLAs and data volumes. Maestro schedules
such agents automatically, but the agents must have their own control
mechanisms to identify the outlets to be harvested.

For SQL-based bulk harvester agents, the structure is shown in the

Figure 7-4.

Typically each instance of such harvester agents process a sub-set of the
outstanding messages on an outlet by outlet basis. harvested records are
re-formatted into the format needed by the Host. When all outlets have
been harvested the harvester exits.

Non-SQL (Flat File) bulk harvesters generate a set of flat files. The Host
application may manipulate the flat files directly, or it may bulk load them
into a database for manipulation (using the SQL flat file load option).
These harvesters should operate between markers in the Riposte
message store. (More than one flat file may be needed.)

Non-SQL bulk harvesters have the structure shown in Figure 7-5.

7.2.2.2 Bulk loader agents

The structure of these depends on the complexity of the Host application,
and whether or not it uses an SQL database.

Simple SQL-based bulk loader agents have the same structure as
interactive loaders. The Host passes records to the agent and the agent
passes them to the Riposte message store.

A bulk loader agent where the Host uses an SQL database is shown in
Figure 7-6.

The Host assembles the records to be loaded and a number of agents are
then started in parallel by the scheduler. When all the agents have
completed their processing, a check process verifies that all the records
have been successfully input to the Riposte message store.

Flat File bulk loader agents receive the flat files from the Host application
and reads the records serially, passing them to Riposte. The structure is
shown in Figure 7-7.

the SQL client, causing the client to read the record from the SQL server.
The interactive agent calls the SQL client to read the record and process
it, including passing it to the Riposte message store using the Riposte
Application Programming Interface.

7.2.3.2 Interactive harvester agents

An SQL based harvester is shown in Figure 7-10. It runs at designated
times of the working day, listening for the arrival of Riposte messages of
the type it is designed to harvest. Such messages are then processed and
the results written to the SQL database's Client Interface Table by a direct
call to the SQL Client.

7.2.4 Enquiry agents

Enquiry agents are invoked by a counter application and acquire data and
pass it back to the application.

The counter application creates a Riposte Priority Message that includes
the enquiry (or update) and its message ID. It next creates a message port
waiting for a response. The message port time out should be set by a
configuration parameter set in a persistent object. Real Time Message
Ports allow Priority Messages to be processed immediately rather than
waiting for the message to arrive in sequence. Delivery through a Real
Time Message Port is not guaranteed, and duplicates may occur, so
agents using Real Time Message Ports must be designed with this in
mind.

7.3 Interface constraints

The constraints that need to be accommodated in the design of an Agent
are presented in the following sections, the general constraints first then
those more specific to particular types of Agent: Bulk, Interactive and
Enquiry.

7.3.1 General

1. Transactional Integrity must be maintained. This is the preservation of
all messages that comprise a single transaction as a single entity for
processing. Agents have to ensure that Riposte messages are never
lost, though they may be duplicated.

© 2000 ICL Pathway Limited COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Page: 154 of 173

FUJ00001368

ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS Ref: TD/STD/004
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

2. Agents must support multi-threading or multiple instances to optimise
the use of the limited number of agent servers.

3. If two or more agents require access to the same set of transactions
within Riposte, they must obey the principle of Vertical Application
separation, and each must retrieve the transactions for their own use.

4. Data can be harvested twice by the same application.

5. All agents must have an application interface specification, defining the
nature of interfaces both in attribute grammar and host syntax

6. If anew application adds a new attribute to any message type that is
harvested by the TPS harvester agent for input to TIP and the Data
Warehouse, the impact of adding the new attribute must be
highlighted. The TIP AIS is described in Pathway to TIP AIS.

7. Monitoring and managing progress when processing SQL records:
Either by marking individual or groups of rows as processed in the
Client Interface Tables; or by maintaining a ‘progress marker’ in
separate control tables. The progress information must be updated
before issuing a ‘Commit’. Riposte transactions must also be
completed before the ‘Commit’.

8. Fetch units: (these are collections of records retrieved by an SQL*net
call. The size of a fetch unit depends on the optimum number of
records that can be retrieved and the associated memory available in
the Agent Server, and is an example of the kind of parameter that must
be specified in the Application’s AIS.

9. Checkpoints: these are collections of markers applied to the whole
message store (to all Correspondence servers in a cluster). An agent
that fails is restarted by Tivoli — the agent must restart from the latest
message store Checkpoint — thus ensuring that all relevant messages
are processed.

Note that there are some conditions that Tivoli cannot detect (a looping
agent, for example).

Checkpoints are expensive to write and so should not be written too
frequently.

10.Recovery — agents must manage the recovery and message
resynchronisation between the Host layer and the Counter Layer
following a failure.

Riposte contains transaction features that allow multiple messages to
be committed as one atomic unit — thus the messages are replicated as
a unit and cannot be processed individually until they have all been
replicated.

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

11.General Recovery rules:

e Applications must be able to detect duplicate messages and ignore
the duplicate.

e Applications must guarantee not to lose messages, though they can
duplicate them.

7.3.2 Bulk agent constraints

1. Bulk agents run continuously and Maestro is configured to initiate their
processing when needed.

2. Bulk agents mark work chunks as ‘in progress’ as soon as they start to
process them - if there is a failure, the bulk Monitor detects it and
initiates a recovery process to recover the failed work chunks.

7.3.3 Interactive agent constraints

1. For SQL driven interactive loader agents, alerts may be lost
occasionally, but to ensure that no records are missed, the SQL Client
also reads the table on a regular time schedule.

2. Non-SQL interactive harvester agents: because clusters are essentially
discrete message stores, one such harvester must run in each cluster.
Clusters are groups of correspondence servers, organised in this way
for performance reasons. Normally only one instance of a harvester
can run in a cluster at a time. For more information about clusters in
Horizon, see TMS Architecture Specification.

7.3.4 Enquiry agent constraints

1. Enquiry agents: if these agents need to go outside to an external
source to gather data, they must set a time-out period that is just longer
than the SLA agreed with the service provider. In order to handle line
failures, the timeout must be significantly less than that of the counter.

2. The current ICL Pathway policy is that Enquiry agents run under
Windows NT; their failure is detected by Tivoli, which will restart them.

8 Systems Management

This section describes the following topics:

« Reference Data: this section describes how Reference Data is
accessed, the temporal nature of such Reference Data and the
process used to maintain such data.

e Event reporting: this section describes the application interfaces to be
used for event reporting, including the reporting of exception
conditions.

e Software packaging: this section describes how software comprising
new applications is to be handed over to ICL Pathway for system
integration testing, and the documentation needed to support such
handovers. It gives an overview of the system and integration process
and subsequent processes leading to implementation of the new
application.

e Diagnostics: this section describes the requirement to make
diagnostic information available so that errors can be interrogated
centrally.

8.1 Reference Data

Reference Data can be received from POCL in the form of a Reference
Data element following an associated Operational Business Change
(OBC) Form, which gives prior notice formally authorising the change.
Note that those changes classed as ‘Basic’ do not require prior
authorisation via an OBC form; examples of basic changes are changes to
product prices, product names, and certain business rules (whether a
product is voidable or reversible, for example).

Type A Reference Data is received from the POCL Reference Data
System (RDS) as a data file in a format conforming to the POCL
Application Interface Specification Reference Data to Pathway, and is
automatically input to the ICL Pathway Reference Data Management
Centre (RDMC).

Type B Reference Data follows a similar route, but is subject to manual
intervention before it is released into the live estate.

Types C and D Implementation Reference Data are dealt with as Work
Packages.

An explanation of the various types of Reference Data, including the types
required to support an application, is given in section 3.1.2.

For further details see Appendix C, System Management.

Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 18/02/00

8.1.1 Change Control

Most of the change control process is outside RDMC with Customer
Services entering details of change requests into RDMC once a change
has been agreed. The actual change reference is generated outside
RDMC. Reference Data can then be associated with the change
reference. This Reference Data is held within RDMC and is not visible to
RDDS until Customer Services release the change reference into the
RDDS environments.

8.1.2 Classes of changes
The Reference Data changes are classified as follows:

1. Class 1 Standard Reference Data changes — These changes require
only data validation. They do not invoke the Change Control process
and thus can be implemented rapidly.

2. Class 2 Business Rules changes — These are subject to Change
Control as they affect ICL Pathway’s levels of service. They are subject
to data validation.

3. Class 3 Logistically Constrained changes — These are subject to
Change Control since they incur logistical constraints such as
installation of equipment.

4. Class 4 Extended Functionality - These changes are subject to
Change Control, data validation and testing.

5. Class 5 New Functionality - These changes are subject to Change
Control and code changes as well as data validation and testing.

Class 1 changes are handled on their own, whereas all others have to be
associated with the relevant Reference Data Change Request that came
from POCL. This association is performed by the POCL Reformat process,
which inserts the change reference and data class into each data line
requiring them.

8.2 Event reporting

Tivoli Event Management is used to gather information about the past and
present behaviour of the managed components, and pass this information
back to the systems management centre. It has two principal components:
Event Server that collects and assesses events, and Event Console, which
displays the status of monitored nodes to an operator.

Within the OPS/TMS environment, events originate from one of two
sources:

e NT Event Log (from all NT processors)

e Tivoli Distributed Monitoring (this is a sentry program which monitors
managed nodes, including counter PCs).

As illustrated in the above diagram, it is the responsibility of the delivery
unit, whether internal to ICL Pathway or external, to supply not only the
items grouped into products, but all the information and values required.
This is the ‘installation’ in the diagram, and the tools and processes of
Configuration Management, CM, enforce its provision. The main CM tool
is PVCS, from Merant.

8.3.2 Development steps

The following is necessary in order for a development group to deliver
software to ICL Pathway:

e Register Configuration Items in the PBS

For a new product on a new platform that has not already been set up
within PVCS, there must be an appropriate Physical Design document
that defines all the physical components involved. Physical Design
documents cover hardware in terms of the capacity of CPU, memory
and discs, and additional components such as Ethernet cards.
Software is defined in terms of the release of NT software required, the
Service Packs that apply, any drivers required for additional cards and
the dependencies on security software, Riposte, Tivoli and auditing
and archive.

e Submit Configuration Items to PVCS

The files placed in PVCS must have attributes entered correctly; where
material is supplied to reproduce an executable, it must be supplied in
the form of a ZIP or TAR file.

Each delivery from development to PIT must detail the content of the
delivery and any dependencies together with installation instructions.

The files are actioned to ensure they are ready for delivery to PIT, and
are captured in the product baseline.

e Create product baseline

PIT requires a full product release, containing the full set of files
required for the product. A baseline is produced from within the
appropriate workset, and against the design part for the product.

During the creation of a product baseline the attributes must be set to
indicate the target release for the product, and to identify to which
platforms the new version of the product should be applied.

« Handover to PIT

Once the product baseline is created, all suitable attributes are set,
and the contents verified, the baseline is actioned to the next state.
This automatically places the baseline in the pending list for each PIT
user.

« Handover to live
This is addressed in Appendix C: System Management.

8.4 Diagnostics

It is necessary to make diagnostic information available for interrogation,
wherever an error occurs on the distributed estate. The information
created by the application to aid diagnosis must be recorded on the node
on which the error occurs, in such a way that it can be interrogated
centrally. For example, it is important that each DLL records its version
number when it is loaded, as it is possible that not all outlets, or nodes
within an outlet, will be running the same software version.

How diagnostic information should be provided is described in Appendix
C, System Management.

The name of any entity must be unique; if an application uses persistent
objects, it must use a unique set of collection names.

A balance must be maintained between performance, including storage
space occupied, and comprehension of a name. Names should be as
short as possible while preserving clarity. For this reason ICL Pathway
requires that application names be abbreviated to three characters and
that ICL Pathway allocates them.

Capitals are used for application names, with the next level of entity being
expressed in mixed case.

9.2 Applications and components

From a configuration management viewpoint, an application and its
components are collected into worksets, allowing for multiple development
streams, each workset holding a complete set of the items needed for a
release.

As development proceeds, the contents of the workset are baselined, to
give a frozen ‘snapshot’ of the state of the items at a point in time.

Figure 9-1, below, shows the cycle in which items from development are
incorporated into a baseline, which is then tested. As development
proceeds and further items are added, the previous baseline is exported to
anew workset, forming a new baseline which is tested.

When development of the application has reached a suitable stage, after
testing the baseline a release is built which can be deployed operationally.
Figure 9-2 below shows this part of the process.

9.4 Naming major configuration items

This table shows, for each entity, the format of the ID, fuller ID or Part Variant, and the full description of the entity. For each
entity the first row shows the general case, and the second an example.

For any Release, there can be more that one Site specific component, and within a Site there may be more than one
Platform (PC or server).

Within a Platform the components are typically Applications and Operating Systems.

For each entity, such as a Release, there is an ID, for which the Part Variant is a more specific attribute, such as V2.0 in the
example shown.

9.4.1 Defining an application

An application, developed by either ICL Pathway or by an external
supplier, must adhere to the standards specified in Table 9-2.

The target version number is the number allocated to the specific version
of an application. That version of the application is delivered on to a
specific version of a platform for a given release of ICL Pathway. Thus the
application is delivered against the target version number. This allows a
release to be defined from the outset.

There is an attribute that can denote a project team’s internal application
version number or a supplier version number.

9.5 Transient messages

These are data records created to support EPOSS and TIP and any other
Client. They are archived after an expiry period, specified by the Expiry
attribute, and determined by the Clients business rules. Transient
Messages have the following generic structure:

Transaction

f I 1
Application Identification EPOSS Data Client Transaction

f I I I
Application Temporal Data Debit Credit

Expiry

[
< EPOSSTransaction EPOSS Transaction

Figure 9-3 Transient message

The naming convention for the Application Identification is to use three
upper case characters: ABC or APS, for example. Note however, that
although historically some applications have four characters, the rule is
now to use three.

There are essentially three classes of Transient Messages:
e Transactions — monetary

e Administration — Non-monetary, office facing that must be recorded.
An example is the receipt by the office of a benefit order book, or
cheque book.

e Event — Non-monetary (with respect to a Stock Unit), customer facing
that must be recorded. An example might be a payment split across
several Client accounts.

Type Generic name IExample
ITransaction APPTransaction \OBCSTransaction
Administration JAPPAdmin APSAdmin

Event APPEvent (ABCEvent

9.6 Persistent objects

These are records that have a start date and an end date. The number of
persistent objects that an application uses should be kept to a minimum.
This is because the more persistent objects, the more adverse the effect
on the performance of the system.
9.6.1 Collection name
The main collections that are used by an application are:
« Products
e Error Messages
e Tokens
e Training Data
e Training Messages

Training data and messages need to be considered separately. ICL
Pathway should be consulted for the rules covering their creation.

The collection name is formed from the application name, abbreviated to
three upper case characters, followed by an abbreviated form of the type
of collection. Example: ABCTkns.

Table 9-3 lists the main types of collections, giving an example collection
name together with a definition of the identifier for the items that make up
the collection.

Table 9-3 Collection names

There are also system collections such as events, which defines the
content of the Event Log reports (for details see Horizon OPS Reports and
Receipts), and various EPOSS collections defining the use of such things
as Scales, and the Impulses from input devices.

9.7 Attributes

The naming of attributes within messages has to reflect two conflicting
requirements:

e The need to be able to easily identify the attribute when diagnosing
errors

e The size overhead implications of long attribute names.

The conventions for assigning attribute names can be summarised as
follows:

e Names are made up of one or more elements, where each element
supports the qualification of the identification of the element. For
example, the Locked attribute identifies whether or not a stock unit is
locked and LockedBy identifies the user who locked it.

¢ Capitals are used at the start of each element of the name (LockedBy
and StockRootNode, for example).

e Abbreviations are used where they are meaningful (Txn in Txnld and
TxnData, for example).

e Consistency of abbreviations should be maintained, as shown in the
previous example.

e Obvious abbreviations, such as TID for token identity, should be used
where possible, to keep names short. In these abbreviations, all
characters are capitalised.

9.8 Events

All applications events must be recorded in the NT Application Event Log.
Recorded details about the event must include:

e Its severity.
e The name of the application that generated it.
e The version of the application code involved.

It is also necessary for each application to be capable of being managed
remotely in terms of restart after an error, or installation of a new version
of the application.

More information on how events are recorded, the constraints imposed on
event management by a distributed remote estate, and the rules
associated with restarting applications is given in Appendix C, System
Management.
