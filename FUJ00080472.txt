4.0 FUJITSU SERVICES HORIZON SERVICE DESK
FOR THE POST OFFICE

4.1 Introduction
This plan covers the following technical services:
Horizon Service Desk (HSD)

HSD is operational Monday to Friday from 08:00 to 18:30, and on Saturday from
08.00 to 14.00 and is comprised of four functional groups:

Front line Service desk staff:
This team takes calls direct from Post Masters or calls passed through from the NBSC

Incident Management Team (IMT)

This team effectively manage and report on any incidents impacting the desk, providing
reporting for the customer and internally. This includes VIP sites/MI and DR instances.
The team also measures all SLAs both contractually and internally.

Communications Management Team (CMT)
This team manage network issues with third party e.g., BT.

Major Account Controllers (MACs)

This group’s role is to monitor and liaise with third parties who provide the
engineering service. Specifically to escalate calls to the third party and provide a point
of escalation to the end user.

Please refer to the Systems Management section of the Horizon Support Service
Continuity Plan (REF3) for details on the reporting of Out Of Hours incidents, e.g. for
operational issues at Post Office Limited or AP client sites.

Much of the infrastructure, e.g. TfS, is common to the HSD and SMC teams as an
incident management system and by RMGA as a Problem Management system, these
services are provided from a shared location at either SDCO1 or SDCO2.

4.1.1 Horizon Service Desk (HSD)

All calls are taken in STEO4. The HSD service is provided out of normal HSD hours
only by the use of a voicemail service.

The HSD provides the following services:

e Support for the following callers:
e Authorised Post Office (Outlet) Staff
¢ Authorised Post Office Limited Staff

e All other authorised users as stated in the Call Enquiry Matrix
DSP/HQ/OPS/001

4.2.1

© Incident logging and all diagnosis for callers entitled to use the Horizon Service
Desk

¢ Call resolution or routing in line with contractual measures.

© Central point for information on the working state of the overall infrastructure
(calls may be passed to the SMC depending on the information required).

¢ Responsibility for the overall management of the call from inception to resolution
with regard to ensuring overall call progression is in line with contractual SLT’s.

e Escalation of incidents where they are likely to breach their individual SLT or
constitute a possible or actual business risk.

e Responsibility for analysing and escalating received incidents and for providing
information on SLT conformance, incident trends and call-handling timescales.

The Incident Management Team is a team within the HSD who deal primarily with
SLA monitoring, Trend Analysis, the Escalations process, Major Incidents, Customer
Complaints, Daily Hardware and network call-backs.

The IMT is broken down into two areas; those who deal solely with the daily hardware
and network call back reports and those that deal with all other aspects of the role.

HSD uses the secure RMGA network to gain access to the TIVOLI management
system.

Common Infrastructure

Voice Systems Features

With the introduction of the Single Point of Contact all calls into the Horizon Service
Desk are routed via a single number operated by BT. This service has been stated to
provide 100% resilience for call delivery into the HSD, and therefore Fujitsu Services
has not provided any additional resilience in order to operate using this service. The
invocation process for changing operational call plans has been modified to reflect the
source of call delivery (being via Post Office Limited during normal operational hours
and via BT at other times).

The HSD is located at a single site in Stevenage (STE04).

The STE04 HSD site has a target ISDN30 bearer receiving Post Office Limited calls
via BT Command Link. The STE04 bearer is supported by two ISDN30 bearers, one
of which has 15 live and 15 spare channels. Calls are automatically cascaded to the
supporting bearers when the target bearer is busy.

In the event that the HSD site in STE04 is rendered inoperable (e.g. building
evacuation), then calls can be either re-directed to a voicemail service, or redistributed
to the HSD disaster recovery site in BRAOI, using BT remote divert and Command

Link. If this cannot be handled automatically by the Network ACD or BT re-routing,
then the ‘remote divert’ will be used to manually re-route calls within the BT network.

All calls diverted to the HSD disaster recovery site are directed to a direct dial number
on the BRAO! Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX).

Remote diverts can be activated, by approved managers, via the Post Office Limited
NBSC or, if OOH via the alternative contact point (refer to the HSD Contingency
Process). This may need to be used in conjunction with the temporary transference of
reinforcement staff from the inoperable centre to a DR site.

HSD uses a Fujitsu shared service for call management called Commander. This
service utilises a multiple server configuration in STE04 which provides automated
resilience in the event of a single server failure.

4.2.2 IT Systems TRIOLE for Service

The TRIOLE for Service (TfS) system is located at SDCO1 (Fujitsu Southern Data
Centre) and is accessed via the Fujitsu Corporate network. There are two application
servers operating as a single system. The loss of one server will cause a loss of
capacity and resilience. All users will be able to run from a single server but those users
that had been logged into the failed server will need to log in again to be connected to
the remaining server.

Engineering incidents, which are to be passed into FMS for resolution, are transferred
from TfS over the OTI link into the D1 system and then to CRISP /Touch system.

4.2.3 Electrical Power

To provide contingency against mains power failure, the HSD TfS system is covered
by UPS and generators in SDCO1, and the HSD telephone communications equipment
in STE04 is also covered by a UPS and standby generator. In the event of power loss
at cither of these locations it is expected that continuous power is provided, initially by
the Un-interruptible Power Supplies and then by the generators.

5.0 Testing Strategy
5.1 Initial Testing

The initial testing of all business continuity contingency plans is documented in the
Business Continuity Test Plan (REF4). For details of the test objectives for the
Horizon Service Desk and services and for an overview of the test, see test 10 in this
reference.

5.2 Ongoing Test Strategy

This refers to how the contingency measures in place for the Horizon Service Desk
(HSD) services will be periodically tested to ensure they are current and reflect the
service model as the services matures.

Fujitsu Services Horizon Service Desk Ref: CS/PLA/015
Business Continuity Plan Version: 12,0
COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 20-Nov-2008.

This will be provided by an ongoing series of business continuity tests at a
predetermined frequency for the duration of the Fujitsu Services RMGA contract. The
nature of these tests is reflected in the Business Continuity Test Plan (REF4).

6.0 Preventative Measures

It is a fundamental philosophy of the RMGA solution that wherever technically
possible, all components of the service are designed in such a way as to ensure
maximum resilience to failure by way of eliminating all possible single points of failure.
i.e. to cover both performance and resilience by providing multiple platforms,
performing similar functionality.

This concept is extended to the provision of the Horizon Service Desk, thus allowing
the Service Desk to be delivered in part, or indeed in total, from one or more Service
Desk sites (including Disaster Recovery sites) should the need arise.

7.0 Preparedness Measures

Preparedness in the Horizon context is defined as those measures taken to ensure the
technical solution and business processes supporting that solution deliver the service
that they are designed to deliver in such a way as to meet and exceed the service level.

7.1 Service Management & Delivery

From a business perspective, this process starts by establishing very exacting and
specific service level agreements with all suppliers to the Horizon Service, which are
constantly monitored and reviewed.

The provision of operational documentation for all aspects of service delivery is
mandated and allows RMGA to ensure that the service is being delivered in a
consistent way that satisfies not only service level requirements but also the quality
model.

7.2. Risk Analysis

Section 10 contains a risk analysis of the Horizon Service Desk service provision. This
is supported by a more detailed risk analysis managed by the FSCS Horizon Service
Desk.

This identifies potential risks to the services, the assessed probability of that risk
occurring, the impact of that risk becoming a reality and the contingency activity or
plans necessary to contain such an occurrence with minimum impact to the service.

Business Continuity Plan Version: 12,0
COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 20-Nov-2008.

8.0 Contingency Measures

Contingency measures are defined as the actions to be performed in the event of a
service break to enable business impact to be minimised during the service outage prior
to recovery being completed.

Contingency measures will include the recognition, activation, incident management
and initiation of recovery procedures.

8.1 Recognition

The Horizon solution includes a Systems Management capability to monitor and report
on events that occur upon the infrastructure platforms involved in the Horizon service
delivery.

Most events that could lead to a break in the HSD service will be recognized by,
operational staff detecting a loss of infrastructure (such as power, phones etc), or
through observation by one of the support groups using system monitoring equipment.

In addition major hardware components (network links and servers) are remotely
monitored and faults can be reported by the monitoring services.

8.2 Activation

Once an event has occurred that will impact the provision of the HSD, a service call
will be raised with the most appropriate support unit via a call to the internal Fujitsu
Services helpdesk service (7799), or direct to the support unit.

8.3 Incident Management

In the event of a major incident the HSD Duty Manager will take command and follow
HSD procedures (REF 10) to implement appropriate actions.

If the incident cannot be resolved by the HSD at the time of the call it will be routed to
the appropriate support unit for resolution. At the same time if the incident meets the
HSD escalation criteria, it will be escalated to the appropriate Fujitsu Services RMGA
CS Service Delivery Manager or Duty Manager. The RMGA CS Service Delivery
Manager or Duty Manager will use the RMGA Incident Management Process (REF6)
to decide if a problem exists.

If the criteria for Cross-Domain Business Continuity Management are satisfied the
RMGA Duty Manager will escalate the incident to the Fujitsu Services RMGA
Business Continuity Manager as a Business Continuity incident.

Note: Post Office Limited may also escalate Business Continuity incidents directly to
the RMGA Duty Manager.
8.4 Initiation of recovery procedures

Where this is a RMGA only problem, recovery would usually be instigated by the
support team charged with supporting the equipment upon which the failure has

occurred, as soon as possible, and certainly with intent to resolve the problem within
the relevant Service Level Target.

Depending on the severity of the problem, there may be some dialogue between the
RMGA Duty/Problem Manager and the support function to agree on the most
appropriate course of action.

Where there is a Cross-Domain problem, the resolution would be instigated at the time
when all parties affected had agreed the course of action.

In the case of a Business Continuity incident, this would be after the Business
Continuity Team had agreed a plan of action, see section 11 Plan Activation.

9.0 Recovery of Normal Service

All aspects of the HSD service infrastructure within RMGA are managed operationally
by FSCS. As such, the process of recovering from an event causing an impact to the
service will by definition involve FSCS, and or other support services within Fujitsu
Services, in performing an operational activity to resume the full service.

FSCS have prepared operational procedures that are referenced from the index
(REF8). The procedures either document the recovery activities from all possible
failures in the end to end service, or reference related operational documents used by
Fujitsu Services.

For simple problems, normal service could be resumed without the need to notify the

RMGA CS Service Delivery Manager or Duty Manager, for more involved problems

the Duty or Problem Manager would liaise with the support teams, agreeing when the
recovery action should be run, and then carrying out that activity.

10.0 Impact & Risk Assessment

The table below summarises the identified risks to the provision of the HSD services.

As a matter of normal operational practice, a call would be placed against HSD (or
other Fujitsu Services support unit) if any of the identified risks materialised.

The intention is that the list identified can act as a guide to personnel assessing and
managing any significant incident affecting the HSD.

The table within section 10.1 contains a column identified as probability with a range
of 0 to 4. These estimate the probable risk of failure. It must be emphasised that these
are not percentages and should be considered simple weighting factors.

As a guideline the following occurrence ratings have been allocated:

Rating
0 Less than one incident is predicted per year

1 One incident is predicted per year

2 Two incidents are predicted per year

3 Approximately three incidents are predicted per year

4 Ensure that appropriate contingency measures are taken e.g. duplicate

routing or the holding of spares on site.

The probability of complete failure of major elements of the service is low because:

There has been a high level of resilience and duplication built into the
infrastructure.

2, Extensive validation has been performed upon the infrastructure.

FSCS HSD Service Management and the Fujitsu Services RMGA project team
have developed a vast knowledge of component failure and service availability
over the life of the service.

10.2 Summary of Contingency Actions

10.2.1 BT Telephone Call Delivery System, via IVR (NBSC), to HSD.

There is no contingency action to be performed by HSD over and above normal operational incident
processes and the actions identified within the above risk tables. This is a BT supplied service.

10.2.2 Loss of Functionality in STE04 for HSD

If STE04 (the primary site in Stevenage) is unavailable for use by HSD provision has been made for
staff to re-locate to facilities in BRAO1, another Fujitsu Services site in Bracknell. If BRAO1 disaster
recovery site is invoked the RMGA Duty Manager is to arrange that all staff occupying HSD DR
desks on the forth floor are instructed that they are to be vacated.

In addition a provision has been made to allow phone contact to be re-established once staff have
relocated, via a BT command switch. During any period when HSD is unavailable to take calls, the
calls will be directed to the voicemail service. Once staff are operational at the alternate location the
voicemail calls will be processed and the callers will be called back. There is about one hundred PCs
in STE04 that can be used for TfS, and other related services (including the MAC function), and
forty PCs in BRAOI.

10.2.3 People

Human Resource Management processes are in place to manage the normal turnover of staff.

10.2.4 Manual Processes due to total loss of TfS Incident Management System

In the event that the TfS servers have failed at both SDCO1 and SDC02, or are inaccessible, or are in
the processed of being failed over, manual processes will be used to log calls until such time as TfS
can be returned to service.

10.2.5 Loss Of access to Tivoli / KMA / One Shot Password System

In the event of the unavailability of Tivoli at STE04, including and PCs used by the SMC, for an
extended period of time (at least 3 hours) then temporary relocation to BRAO1 shall be considered.
There are twenty five Tivoli PCs in STE04 and four at the DR site in BRAO1.

In the event of the unavailability of all of the KMA (Key Management) Workstations (there are
seven in STE04 — and one in BRAO1), or all One Shot Password Systems in STE04 (there are six in
STE04 - two in BRAO1), including the loss of any that may be available in the SMC, for an extended
period of time (at least 3 hours) then temporary relocation to BRAO! shall be considered.

10.2.6 Loss Commander — call management

In the event that calls are not being passed by the normal call management system (Commander) it is
possible to switch to the use of the standard ACD (Auto Call Distribution) system, however this may
limit call management capability and reduce the number of calls being handled.

If whatever has caused the Commander system to be unusable is also preventing use of the ACD
system then calls will be diverted to voice mail and consideration given to a moving to the DR site.

11.0 Plan Activation

Once the criteria for Business Continuity involvement has been satisfied, i.e. an MBCI Trigger from
the table of risks above (section10), and after a call has been placed, and appropriate details logged
with the HSD (where possible), the problem ownership is passed to the RMGA member of the
Business Continuity Management team.

After compiling all relevant information, and if necessary communicating this to the other members
of the BCMT listed below (section 12), a full impact assessment will be conducted to determine if
the Fujitsu Services RMGA Business Continuity Management Process (REF7) will be invoked. This
will be done in conjunction with Senior Managers, relevant Business Units, and Expert Domains, as
appropriate

If the Joint BCM processes are invoked, the next step will be to agree who from the BCMT owns
the MBCI.

The BCMT will then agree a plan of action and agree upon the recovery and contingency activities
to be carried out. The planning will be done in conjunction with Senior Managers, relevant Business
Units, and Expert Domains, as appropriate.

The agreed plan will then be monitored and reviewed until such time as the MBCI impacting the
affected service has been resolved, and the MBCI closed.

Refer to REF 18 for full details of the Fujitsu Services RMGA Business Continuity Management
Process.
