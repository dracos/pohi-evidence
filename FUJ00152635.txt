All

(Not to be passed on)

Spoke to Dianne and the latest (last Friday) is that Mr thomas has now asked for a lesser charge to be considered which
he 'might' plead guilty to???

This has come about since his own IT Expert has had a look at the evidence !!

Dianne states that it will be conditional upon his conformation that Horizon ‘in no way' played a part in this loss, so we
wait and see, meanwhile Dianne is hoping to come back to us by end of week on who is required and the details.

She has my number and has stated she will call me as soon as she knows something.

Diane,

least by Friday 15th} GRO if)

Specifically,

* Should I be planning to travel to Caernarfon on Sunday 24th?
* Do I need to make Hotel Bookings (if so where / how long)
* What exactly are the arrangements? (Address with Postcode, time etc.)

As I said before, I'm happy to pick up details of late changes (or a cancellation) on the morning of Sunday 24th and
adjust any arrangements as necessary. I'd prefer to have a definite positive / negative confirmation at that time either by
email or phone. Who should I contact? Is it you?

Regards

Gareth

Diane,

I thought I'd keep you updated:

former!)

I'm prepared to travel up to Caernarfon on Sunday 24th, but will clearly
need final confirmation as to whether it is still "on" that Sunday. I
can check emails on the Sunday, or will pick up voicemails on my mobile.
I'll also need guidance as to whether or not to make hotel bookings in
Caernarfon! I

Hi Gareth,

Anyway, we are still hopeful that it will be resolved prior to the trial
but we have to plan it as if it will go ahead.

All witness's will have to be present on the lst day unless the defence
has

agreed there statement and dont wish to ask any questions about that

evidence. It is pretty much as you see on the TV really but remember
that

you will have sight of your statement prior to taking the stand and can
only be asked questions specifically about your statement.

A lot can happen between now and Sept 25th as Mr Thomas defence are
still

asking a lot of questions so we will wait with anticipation.
I will keep you informed and many thanks for your flexibility, it is
very

much appreciated

Diane,

I understand also that the trial is in Caernarfon. Do you have any idea
as

to how much time will be involved and what exactly is required? I've
never

been to court in any capacity and my knowledge of such things is based
on

films and TV (which I'm sure are inaccurate!)

Gareth
