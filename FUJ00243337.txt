Please go ahead and raise the 1st PO for £13k only at this stage.

When the scope of work has been agreed for the second stage a PO can be raised for the balance.
Regards

James/ Stephen,

Please see attached the draft letter of engagement and terms for the KPMG Horizon
review.
I believe that these have now been approved by the project team, Sourcing and Sourcing
legal.

I understand that the next step is to obtain account approval and since this is not funded
by client revenues this will need approval by Steve Clayton.

Please note that Stage 0 (value £13k) is scheduled for March and that there is a
contractual break point before proceeding to Stages 1 and 2, therefore the firm
commitment will only be for stage 0

Stage 0 will also deliver the final pricing for stages 1 and 2 which will depend upon the
volumes of controls that are to be tested in these stages.

Regards
Tim

Peter,

Do you mean you are seeking approval for the maximum total spend for which there may
be a few decision points along the journey?

You are correct that this is the initial investment, however I need to get approval for the
possible TCV.

Agreed — and we were going to take baby steps... not sure where this has gone but not in line
with the last meeting I attended.

Peter, you and I need a call with Stephen on this.
