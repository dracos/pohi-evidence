Rod,

I’ve just had a call from Luke. He has proposed a practical solution, which involves him reading the relevant
extracts to you and then you can decide if it is worth obtaining the documents via legal process. Please can
you give me a call when you have a minute to discuss?

Best regards,

Johann

Private & Confidential - SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE - Sent in Connection with the Post
Office Group Litigation

Luke (cc’ing Johann Appel, Post Office Head of Internal Audit),

Following our telephone call on Friday, Post Office Ltd is trying to locate:
a 2010 Ernst & Young management letter; and/or

Royal Mail Group Audit Committee or Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC) minutes for
2010/2011.

These audit-related documents are sought to assist our preparations for the Post Office Group Litigation
“Horizon Issues” trial. That trial will take place in March 2019 to determine (primarily on expert evidence)
technical issues concerning the Horizon IT system used to record transactions in Post Office branches.

By way of context:

¢ In his report filed on 16 October 2018, the Claimants' expert Jason Coyne refers to issues with
Credence (a back office accounting system which uses Horizon data) to support his conclusion that
Horizon may not be reliable.

¢ The Credence issues are mentioned in EY’s 2011 management letter (disclosed in the Group
Litigation) and concern weak change controls and a lack of documentation to approve fixes and
patches.

* To address the Credence issues, EY recommended that Post Office require its IT provider Logica to
segregate the roles of developer and implementer, maintain complete and accurate records of any
changes, and periodically audit the achievement of service level agreements.

¢ EY’s 2011 management letter notes that in 2010 Post Office management stated that Logica had been
asked to comply with EY’s recommendations and ensure appropriate role separation and that further
work would be carried out on this, hence our request for the 2010 EY management letter.

¢ The 2011 EY management letter did not however comment on whether the issues had been fully
addressed as this particular issue was not within scope.

¢ Weare therefore trying to determine whether any other audit-related documents disclose whether these
issues were addressed and if so how, hence our request for Royal Mail Group Audit Committee or
Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC) minutes for 2010/2011 which may address this issue.

I hope that clarifies our request. Please let me know if not.

We are unfortunately running on a very tight timetable, so any prompt attention you could provide to this
would be very much appreciated so that if appropriate, disclosure can be made as soon as possible this
week. I do of course apologise for the short notice.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss or require anything further.

With thanks and kind regards, Rodric
