Dear All
As a brief update, the Judge has set the following timetable for the recusal application:

Post Office to file a further witness statement by 12pm on 26 March

Cs to confirm whether they will oppose the application by 12pm on 27 March
Cs responsive evidence to be filed on 29 March

Skeletons on 2 April

Hearing on 3 April

Further thoughts will follow shortly on the drafting of the witness statement and skeleton argument once we have
discussed these documents with Counsel in more detail. But if there are any questions in the meantime, please let
either Tom or me know.
