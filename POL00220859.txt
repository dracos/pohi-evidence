We have previously discussed this. We now need to consider whether or not we action this, presumably. It seems to
me that this has the potential to be incredibly time consuming and costly and we need to consider to what end.
Has there been any further progress on this since we last discussed?

Thanks
Belinda

This is a long outstanding request that was left with Andy Holt. (Full email archives for 2008 for Martin ROLFE — a POL
employee working at Bracknell)

The request was passed onto CSC for action by them.

I would be grateful for an update on this as the underlying issues now apply to a number of cases.

Many thanks

With best wishes

The request is for all of 2008 for employee Martin Rolfe
We require both Sent and Received — ideally the entire NSF file from the backup of the Domino server

Depending what is found, there may be further request for an extended time frame or emails relating to other
employees.

Remind me the name of the person and the time frame of emails you want — I have given CSC clarity on the
requirement, they just need this to progress. Presume you want both sent and received.

Does that cover your requirement.
