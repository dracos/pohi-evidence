Thx angela,

Tracy's covering for Jackie today - I'm sure we can do an electronic signature.

On the process my concern would be if they didn't record the cheque correctly at the time of transaction. The manual entry
would have picked this up. Are we fixing one problem but creating a different one?

Regards,

Kevin,
Thanks. Is Jackie able to insert your electronic signature and send back to me?

Finance concurrence already given to the CAF. This activity is already within the BSP business case so the
CAF and one pager completes the governance requirements.

The current in-branch procedure is reliant on the user manually verifying that cheques on hand match
the Horizon system. This is the problem area that the new process will address and in doing so reduce
errors in that the Horizon system will automatically pull through the rem out figure rather than the user
inputting the figure into Horizon..

Hi angela,

This looks good thank you. I'm happy to sign off the caf. Have finance signed this off and is there any
governance eg short form business case this needs to go through?

On a technical point, previously, didn't the manual entry of cheques reconcile with what they'd entered
into horizon at the time of the transaction? How do they now ensure they've got it right?

Thx

Kevin,

Attached is a CAF that requires your approval. This is to progress with a Horizon
improvement for the cheque rem out process in branch. The attached one page
explanation gives more detail. Would you be able to turn this around asap please as we
need to get this change in to the March 2015 Horizon release if we are to realise full year
savings of £85k in 15/16.

Thanks,
Angela
