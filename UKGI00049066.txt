Dear

Thank you for your letters, with enclosures, to the Prime Minister and of 1 and 15
March to Stephen Byers, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, concerning your
daughter, Mrs Wolstenholme, and the termination of her contract as subpostmaster
at Cleveleys Modified Sub Post Office. Your letters have been passed to this
Directorate in view of our interest in Post Office matters and I have been asked to
reply. I apologise for the delay in doing so.

I should first explain that it has been the policy of successive Governments since
1969 that decisions relating to the day-to-day running of the postal businesses
including contractual terms and arrangements with subpostmasters, are the
responsibility of Post Office management. The Government's role in Post Office
matters is confined to broad issues of general policy and overall financial control.

However, I have been in contact with Post Office Network (PON) headquarters and
I understand that there was extensive contact between Mrs Wolstenholme and PON
regional staff about a range of issues, including the possibility of your daughter
making representations to the PON Sales and Service General Manager, Eric
Logan.

Yours sincerely

Mike Whitehead
Postal Services Directorate
