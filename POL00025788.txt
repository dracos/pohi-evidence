Hi Andy — I attach two documents:

Mark ups to the paper you drafted after our call last week.

The underlying questions paper from Second Sight, wherein I have added a table which explains the various
forms of suspense accounts

Separately I know I need to forward you the “suspense releases spreadsheet” and I am also nearing
completion of the other questions in Second Sight’s Report 2.

Please have a look at the attached and then I wonder if we may be able to speak tomorrow.

Thanks, Rod
