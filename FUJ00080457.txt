Integration Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0010).

Fujitsu Services shall provide a non dedicated service desk function sharing the
resource with other Fujitsu Services customers as described within this Service Desk,

interruptions are service affecting and will inform Post Office when the affected
services will be restored as documented within the Working Document entitled:

a professional manner whenever dealing with callers, complying with agreed Service
Desk behavioural standards. Fujitsu Services shall ensure sufficient skilled resources
are available to cover for holidays, sickness and natural wastage within Fujitsu
Services.

7 Fujitsu Services shall provide on line access to the Incident Management System call-
handling tool to Post Office. Post Office shall inform Fujitsu Services as necessary of
all Post Office staff who are authorised to access the tool.

18 To the extent that such notification is required by law, Fujitsu Services shall be
responsible for ensuring that Service Desk Customers are notified that calls may be
recorded for training and monitoring purposes.

19 Fujitsu will monitor the quality of the Service Desk Service to ensure that it meets the
Post Office specifications as documented within the Working Document entitled:
“Service Desk Joint Working Document” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0010). This may include
the recording of calls, where this is reasonably possible, for the purposes of
monitoring call control, customer satisfaction, knowledge and system use. Post Office
will agree the method and timescale with Fujitsu Services and reserve the right of
audit of any internal quality scoring.

1.20 Where Post Office chooses to carry out user satisfaction surveys, in the event that
any such survey results are pertinent to Fujitsu Services’ provision of the Service
Desk Service, the relevant survey results shall be shared with Fujitsu Services at the
next meeting of the Service Management Relationship.

Contacting the Service Desk

Branches will contact the Service Desk either by using the SPOC telephone number,
selecting the appropriate IVR option for the Service Desk, or via the Web Interface.

All Post Office internal departments including NBSC, Post Office Clients and the
SCT will contact the Service Desk using the telephone numbers provided within the
Working Document entitled: “Service Desk Joint Working Document”
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0010,) which vary depending on the time the call is made to the
Service Desk.

Fujitsu Services internal departments will contact the Service Desk using a dedicated
telephone number which vary depending on the time the call is made to the Service
Desk.

Incident Management

The Service Desk first line agent will answer the call and welcome the caller. The
caller will be asked a number of appropriate and agreed questions to validate their
identity and ensure they are authorised to speak to the Service Desk. Where callers
are unable to successfully complete this validation, the call will be terminated by the
Service Desk.

If the NBSC has referred the caller to the Service Desk, caller validation will have
already been completed by the NBSC. Further call validation will not be completed
by the Service Desk, other than to confirm the identity of the caller. Should the caller
subsequently be found or shown to be unauthorised, Fujitsu Services will not be liable
for giving information or advice to such callers.

Those callers passing validation checking, or who have been transferred from the
NBSC, will then be asked the nature of the call, and the equipment or the
functionality affected.

in relation to the Incident, in which case that unique reference number will be used.

The Incident record will contain the information as described within the Working
Document entitled: “Service Desk — Joint Working Document”
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0010).

The Service Desk first line agent will take the details of the reported fault and then
may refer to a knowledge base and undertake diagnosis. The diagnosis may resolve
the Incident in which case the Service Desk first line agent will close the Incident
with the agreement of the caller.

as described within the Working Document entitled: “Service Desk Joint Working
Document” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0010).

Incident as described within the Working Document entitled: “Service Desk Joint
Working Document” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0010).

Calls that do not fall into the categories listed within the Working Document entitled:
“Service Desk Joint Working Document” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0010) but that are
relevant to the NBSC will be classed as inappropriate to the Service Desk and the
caller will be referred to the NBSC for further advice.

Calls that do not fall into those categories listed in the Working Document entitled:
“Service Desk Joint Working Document” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0010) and are not
relevant to the NBSC will be classed as inappropriate and the call will be terminated
by the Service Desk.

Management System can be found in the Working Document entitled: “Service Desk
Call Enquiry Matrix and Incident Prioritisation Document”. (CS/FSP/002).

The Service Desk Service will set callers’ expectations when the Incident is not
resolved on the initial call and update the caller in line with the expectations set. This
does not include the provision of routine Incident updates where the Incident is being
resolved within the appropriate SLT unless Fujitsu Services has committed to a
resolution time with the Branch.

assess whether on average, in the relevant Service Level Measurement Period, the actual
number of calls is more than 110% or less than 90% of the limit. In making that assessment,
Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall consider the cause of any monthly peaks in excess of
the monthly averages during the period and disregard the measurements in respect of those
months where the peaks have arisen as a result of a Fujitsu Services Default. If, having made
this assessment, Post Office and Fujitsu Services agree (acting reasonably), that the actual
number of calls is more than 110% or less than 90% of the limit applicable within any three
(3) consecutive months, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall meet to discuss, (acting
reasonably), any appropriate action, which shall include consideration of the amount of the
Charges for the Service Desk Service which may be increased or decreased to reflect any
increase or decrease in Fujitsu Services' costs as assessed on an Open Book basis. Any such
adjustment to the Charges for the Service Desk Service shall be agreed under the Change
Control Procedure.

It is expected that 10% (ten per cent) of Incidents will be logged by Branches via the Web
Interface.

Any increase in the percentage of Incidents logged via the Web Interface will instigate a
review of the price of the Service Desk Service quoted in Schedule D1 of this Agreement and
a revised price per Counter Position assessed on an Open Book basis and agreed between
Post Office and Fujitsu Services. Any such adjustment to the Charges for the Service Desk
Service shall be agreed under the Change Control Procedure.

If circumstances arise such that Post Office requires urgent changes to the level of service for
the Service Desk Service, Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to extend the level
of service as soon as reasonably practicable to whatever is required by Post Office for a price
to be assessed on an Open Book basis and agreed between the Parties. Any such adjustment
to the Charges for the Service Desk Service shall be agreed under the Change Control
Procedure. In these circumstances, any appropriate SLTs in force will be suspended.

Assets and Licences

Assets

There are no assets associated with the Service Desk Service.

2.5.2

The Service Desk Service will ensure that all third party software licences from time to time required
by Fujitsu Services to provide the Service Desk Service are maintained to ensure they are current and
valid for the version of third party software being used at the time. Where a licence or its associated

Service Desk Service will ensure that the appropriate renewal process, as defined by the appropriate
software vendor or licensor, is completed and a new licence is concluded prior to the expiry date to
