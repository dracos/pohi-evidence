For info.

Alan has told the Chris Brooke at the Mail that we will be making an announcement next Friday. He will probably

quote Alan on this, and of course I didn’t deny we were very close to making an announcement. He has our
statement which of course that says we are working with the JFSA towards this.

He did ask me if mediation meant compensation. I didn’t get drawn either way just confirming working closely with

the JFSA to make sure this mediation process is in place.
