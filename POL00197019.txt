Who is responsible for — our public commitments?

Feonminens Towne]

1. The creation of a working party to work collaboratively to complete Angela
the review of cases started by Second Sight last year. This would

examine the themes identified by Second Sight and consider all

cases brought forward by the JFSA and MPs, together with any new

themes which emerge from these cases. The JFSA have been invited

to join this working party.

2. Areview chaired by an independent figure to determine how an Susan
independent safety net might be introduced to adjudicate in disputed

cases in the future. Again the JFSA and other stakeholders will be

invited to take part in this process.

3. Anew Branch User Forum to provide a way for sub-postmasters Angela
and others to raise issues and insights around business processes,

training and support, directly feeding into the organisation's thinking at

the highest level. A key task for this forum will be to review support

processes and training to ensure they meet the standards expected

of the Post Office.

Objectives:

+ Second Sight exit the investigation in the medium term

+ Retain the confidence of key stakeholders (JFSA, JA, other MPs and SS)
+ Reduce our investigation costs

+ Create an enduring capability for independent investigation

+ Keep aligned to the Parliamentary Statements

+ Augment Second Sight with Post Office employees who will work under the oversight of Second
Sight

+ Propose that at first this is Angela and two assistants, with the view to grow the team to meet
demand

+ Second Sight step back from the detailed work (hence less cost) and play an oversight role

+ The POL team establish a reputation for independence of mind, integrity, and thoroughness in their
investigations

+ Once credibility of the POL team is established Second Sight give them the seal of approval and
pass the baton on to them.

As a reminder some of The continued input of Second Sight is
