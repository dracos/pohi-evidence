Who in POL had the idea to have a review into Horizon.Given my strong support for the integrity
of the Horizon system over 5 years ,I am disappointed that my views on this course of action
were not sought,I am also surprised that after leaving messages with POL no one has picked up
the phone to talk through this contentious decision.

Please can Alwen contact George as I'm out this pm, and make sure that we have a process for
capturing ‘interest’ that comes in via the Fed.

George thank you for this. We will be completely open and transparent. I'd like to get this cleared
up for everyone.

ASAP thanks

Paula

Dear Sir/Madam

Ref; Thorney Post Office, 5 Abbey Place PE6 , Computer Systems
failure.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18535354

I have previously written to you regarding a computer errors not balancing
correctly at the end of each day and my 63 year old mother having to use her
POL00143243
POL00143243

own money to balance the system. After constant checking, as my mother use
to work in a bank and has been a sub post mistress for twelve years she is
more than able to do this basic task, however, the system still did not balance
even when on paper it should. Because of this she has had to use her own
funds to balance the system or be accused of being incompetent or
fraudulent.

After weeks of telephone conversations by my Mother with unhelpful staff
from nameless Post Office personal I contacted your organisation in order for
your support and advice.

Your advice was close to useless your support was non existent and my
Mother was just insulted by a man stating the obvious over the telephone.

So please explain to me the link I attach below and why after several letters
you did not bring this to my attention?

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18535354

I would like you to contact Mrs G Taylor at Thorney Post Office, 5 Abbey
Place, Thorney PE6 and apologise for your lack lustre performance and how
you are going to support her further as I thought is the whole point being a
paid member of National Federation of Sub Postmasters.

Yours sincerely

Paul Taylor
