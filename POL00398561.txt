Risks, Horizon Extension, Transition and IPR (507) FUJITSU

= Separate conversations on Strategic Topic. Since the last exec meeting there have been a number of
separate discussions covering Risks, IPR, Horizon Extension and Exit activities. The focus today is on
linking these conversations and reconfirming Fujitsu's consistent position with regards to these subjects.

= Exit support. FJ is fully committed to comply with its contractual obligation as defined in the current
contract, with regard to all associated activities as these materialise under Post Office direction.

= Subcontracting. FJ do not intend to provide subcontracting services to any 3" party as part of transitioning
to the Post office new operating model.

® Horizon Extension Service. LS original request was for a 12-18 month extension of service, commercially
concluded by end of Financial Year 31 Mar 2015. Lack of progress from CT submitted coupled with POL
identification of changes to internal Governance protocol make this an unrealistic target at this stage. There
is concer that this may limit the ability to provide the necessary runway to implement the refresh activates
based on the previous programme which addressed 35% of the estate and was delivered in 24months.

= IPR. Post Office have been made aware that certain documents Post Office is proposing to share (or has
shared) with potential Next Suppliers under the Towers Due Diligence Process contain aspects of Fujitsu
IPR. Whilst Post Office may, in certain limited circumstances (e.g. provided such sharing is reasonably
required for the bona fide potential Next Supplier to submit a detailed tender), have the right under the
Horizon Agreement to share such documents with such parties, this does not change the fact that Post
Office needs to secure a release from Fujitsu to enable third parties to use this IP. It is Fujitsu's
recommendation this IP release is completed as soon as possible to avoid any potential unlicensed use of
Fujitsu’s IP and ensure that Post Office does not inadvertently breach the Horizon contract.
