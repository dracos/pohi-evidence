Everyone is Customer Facing!

Our customers must be the focal point at all times and our
behaviour will reflect this

« We are more focused on customers than internals

« We spend more time with customers than we
currently do

« We spend more time preparing for customer
meetings than internal meetings

* Our internal review packs reflect our current thinking
and conversations with customers
