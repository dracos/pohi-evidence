Chief Financial Officer's Report
Mr Harris presented his report FSMC/07/02.

Mr Hirata expressed thanks for Fujitsu Services’ contribution to the
group.

In response to questions, Mr Courtley advised that it would be a
challenge to achieve the profit target that FS had committed to for
the year to 31*' March 2007 but the importance of exceeding that
target was recognised. It was unlikely to be known before the end
of the year whether the stretch target of £172 million could be
achieved.

Mr Harris explained that the percentage increase in operating
expenses forecast for the 07 full year budget was greater than the
percentage increase in revenues due to the inclusion of TDS and
the way TDS classified costs. If TDS were removed, in fact,
operating expenses were £14 million below MTP.

PBT of £173.7 million was proposed, being the incorporation of the
TDS business case at a loss of £3.3 million for the cost of funding
the acquisition with the FS MTP of £177 million.

Following a discussion about the negative impact on revenues of
the loss of the bid to Centrica and delays on the DIl and NHS
projects and the positive contribution to revenues of TDS and,
potentially, other projects in the pipeline, it was eventually agreed
that FS would cover the costs of funding the acquisition of TDS and
would revise its budget for PBT for the year to 31%! March 2008 to
the £177 million projected in the MTP.

Major Bids Report

Mr Courtley presented the Major Bids Report FSMC/07/03 drawing
attention to the Reuters bid which was a global outsource of desk
top support. This would be a good reference for other global
customers if it were won but competition was fierce because
competitors recognised that there was a further opportunity with
respect to Reuters in-house development of operational software.
He raised concerns about the ability of other Fujitsu companies to
deliver support capability to FS commenting that it was unfortunate
that FS had to use a subcontractor in the USA rather than a Fujitsu
company. In Asia, FS had already demonstrated to Reuters that it
could provide service from Singapore and had been able to build
upon that.

Major Accounts Report
Mr Courtley introduced the Major Accounts Report FSMC/07/06.

He advised that with respect to the NHS Account, there had been
increased press comment this week as an FS employee had made

This had disturbed both the customer and FS and action was being
taken to regulate the situation.

place of the current processes with Citibank.
