2. Training and Support

2.1. I Received initial training from Defendant I Yes. Pending access to any training records
re: Horizon when introduced inI that Post Office may hold, my recollections
1999/2000 (Yes/No) are as follows:

Horizon was introduced to the branch in
February 2000. Prior to it being installed, I
attended a one day training course held by
Post Office with my wife.

A trainer from Post Office also attended the
branch for 1 week (5 working days) following
the installation of Horizon. When I was not at
work I attended the branch and the trainer
showed me how to use Horizon.

I thought the training provided by Post Office
was inadequate. It was clear that the trainer
lacked the knowledge and understanding to

CS/2128851/1 2

POL00066256
POL00066256

demonstrate how to use Horizon.

Rob McLachlen, a Retail Line Manager, also
attended the branch some 3 weeks after
Horizon had been installed to assist me and
my wife with the balancing process. We
could not get the branch to balance.

Mr McLachlen did not really help. It was
clear that he also did not know what he was
doing and we resorted to using the manual
provided by Post Office. Mr McLachlen left
the branch around 10pm but My wife and I
remained there until 11pm trying to achieve a
balance.

2.2.

Received initial training from Defendant

2.3.

Defendant re: Horizon? (Yes/No, and if
yes give date and brief details of any
training said to have been inadequate or
inappropriate)

I received no further training from Post
Office.

2.4.

Contacted Helpline to seek advice re:
Horizon and/or alleged shortfalls?
(Yes/No, and if yes give approximate
date and brief details of any advice and
responses said to have been inadequate
or inappropriate)

Pending access to any helpline call logs that
Post Office may hold, my recollections are as
follows:

No. I did not contact the Helpline regarding
Horizon and/or alleged shortfalls.

Apparent or Alleged Shortfalls

3.1.

For each apparent or alleged shortfall
attributed by the Defendant to the
Claimant and in relation to which
complaint is made, specify:

(a) Amount(s):
(b) Date(s):
(c) Paid by the Claimant to the

Pending access to full transaction and
account records from Horizon, I am only able
to give approximate figures, although I do
have a clear recollection of payments having
been made by me.

Shortfalls under £100

I regularly paid small amounts of money into

Defendant? (Yes/No, and dates I the branch to make good apparent shortfalls

of payment). whilst my wife was Subpostmistress. I cannot
(d) How did the Claimant treat the I recall the specific dates and amounts but I

above amounts in the accounts I would estimate that I paid around £2,000.

and why?
Shortfalls over £100

Again, I cannot recall specific dates or I
amounts when apparent shortfalls arose. I
do recall that the first large shortfall was for
the sum of £5,000. This occurred after
completing the balance procedure.

I always helped my wife complete the
procedure. My wife usually counted the
motor vehicle licences of which there were
around 800 and I would undertake the rest of
the process. When Horizon showed there to
be a shortfall of £5,000 I assumed that this
was an error and thought that it would
eventually return via an error notice. I
therefore altered the figures on Horizon to
make the branch balance as I could not
afford to make good a loss of that size.

The missing sum did not return and more
shortfalls began to occur. If the shortfalls
were over £100 I did alter the figures which I
input into Horizon to achieve a_ perfect
balance. I genuinely thought that the system
would eventually correct the errors and in the
meantime, the branch could continue to
trade.

! did not tell my wife about the shortfalls as I
did not want her to worry or affect her health.

4, Audit and Investigation

4.1. I Did the Defendant conduct one or more I I can vividly remember the audits (and/or
audits of the branch prior to termination? I investigations) taking place, however, in
(Yes/No, and if yes give date and brief I relation to specific dates, I will require access
details) to Post Office's audit records. In the
meantime, I can give approximate details as
follows:

2 audits took place before Horizon was
introduced at the branch. I was not present

CS/2128851/1 4

POL00066256
POL00066256

when these audits took place.

The third audit took place on 13 May 2004. I
was not at the branch when the auditors
arrived but my wife called me and mentioned
that an audit was taking place. I therefore
attended the branch to tell the auditors that
Horizon was showing a discrepancy of
around £63,000.

My wife did not know about the discrepancy
and was in total shock. The auditors asked
me what I had “done with the money”. I was
shocked by this. I had not taken any money
from the branch. However, I could not
explain the apparent shortfalls.

The auditors found a shortfall of £64,435.24
to which a further net amount of £931.22 was
added in respect of further transactions.

Two investigators arrived at the branch. I
recall that I was taken into a room where the
investigators had set up a tape recorder. I
was questioned under caution.

The interview was like an interrogation. I
was asked over and over where the money
was. I told the investigators repeatedly that I
had not taken any money.

The investigators also asked me when the
shortfalls had started. I told the investigators
that I didn’t know, but the investigators
persisted. I therefore told them that it had
happened over a period of 3 months, just to
provide them with an answer. However, it
was obvious from the cash accounts that the
shortfall had accrued over a much longer
period. In the end, we agreed on 1 year but I
do think it was a longer period than this.

During the interview, I also gave the
investigators permission to review my
financial information. To my knowledge, Post
Office never did this.

! provided a statement to the investigators
admitting that I had covered up the alleged

CS/2128851/1 5

POL00066256
POL00066256

shortfall from the Post Office and my wife.

The investigators then questioned my wife,
even though it was clear that she knew
nothing about the shortfalls and she was
suspended by Post Office.

4.2. I Was there an investigation carried out by I No. I have seen no evidence of any adequate

believe that Post Office did not do this. Ata
subsequent court hearing Post Office’s legal
representative asked the judge for
permission to access my _ financial
information. I explained to the judge that I
had already consented to this. Post Office
could not explain to the judge why they had
not already looked at this before bringing
charges against me.

pressure from Defendant for a reason
related to alleged shortfalls (Yes/No, and
if yes give date and brief details)?

5.7. I Did the Defendant prevent or impede I Yes. Following the termination of my wife’s
sale or transfer of the Claimant's I appointment, Post Office gave us just 3
business? (Yes/No, and if yes give date I months to sell the business. We initially
and brief details) advertised the business for sale for the sum
of £120,000. This would allow us to
discharge our loans. However, with little
interest from buyers and the time constraints
put on us by Post Office, we were forced to
reduce the sale price to £80,000.

A couple of offers were made but they fell
through. I do suspect that Post Office had
something to do with this. We subsequently
received an offer of £60,000 which was
significantly less than what the business was
worth. However, we were in a desperate
situation and therefore, agreed to accept
£65,000.

The sale subsequently fell through as Post
Office, without our knowledge and/or
consent, offered to sell the licence to the
branch to our buyer. Therefore, she did not
need to buy the business from us.

Eventually the Post Office gave the licence to
the temporary Subpostmaser, Tony Beety.
We were informed about this on 11

CS/2128851/1 7

POL00066256
POL00066256

November 2004 by the then Retail Line
Manager, Jayne Kaye.

Following Post Office’s suggestion, My wife
and I had allowed Mr Beety to run the retail
business whilst he was temporary
Subpostmaster. He paid us rent for this in
the sum of around £600. I did ask Mr Beety
to buy the business and he said that he
wouldn’t take the branch even if it was given
to him. Nonetheless, he did take the licence
from Post Office. I suspect that he already
had an agreement in place with Post Office
when I approached him. Mr Beety did
purchase the retail stock from us at cost price
for a few hundred pounds.

prove that I had committed Theft. He
gave them until 28 January 2005 to either
provide evidence or alter the charges
against me. Post Office subsequently
amended the charges but asked that the
Theft charge lie on file.

I was sentenced to 9 months
imprisonment which was suspended for 2
years. In addition, I was ordered to pay
costs in the sum of £1,000 which I was to
pay in monthly instalments of £50.

licence to run the post office to the temporary
Subpostmaster. We therefore were left with
