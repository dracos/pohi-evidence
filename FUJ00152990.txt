Andy

I requested the events to be checked to support your witness statement; I've had a chat with Gareth this
morning and as no transaction data has been requested it is pointless going further with the exercise.

However, you may like to check Anne’s comments against the calls in your witness statement.

Penny,
Anne has looked at the event logs.
She's identified a number of things below to check out.

Are you able to check out the specific times she has indicated, firstly to see if anyone was Logged on and
secondly against Andy Dunk’s Call logs.

If you need some help with the specifics, then please let me know.

Gareth, sending just to you initially.

1 know you have even more on your plate than I do, but my involvement has always been
unofficial and on the basis that I had time to do it. If I need to do more detailed analysis on
this (and I'm not sure what I would be able to find, without knowing what their specific
problem was) it will have to be officially agreed with my manager - you can instigate that if
you like, but I don't think I can keep volunteering.

There are several entries on the 1 Sysman 2 126023 tab which require some further
investigation. I've added some highlighting.

Counter 1 on 2/3 May 2006, and 4 Feb 2008. I don't know whether the counter was
replaced, or whether the messagestore was deleted and copied from another counter. The
Powerhelp / TfS calls may illuminate this.

I don't know if the counter was used while these errors were occurring - it may have been.
If they have any complaints specific to these times, perhaps they should be checked out???

There are some isolated timeout waiting for lock messages, but in general these appear to
be associated with checksums being written. To be on the safe side, it could be checked
whether anyone was logged on

counter 1 or 2, 3-Apr-2007, 20:30
counter 2 28-May-2008, 01:33
counter 1 18-Aug-2008, 11:04

and if so check the messages to find which processes were in contention.

It is notable that the branch does not have the repeated lock messages which were a
feature of the Callender Square problem.

Error Message: Error in node retrieval for node(s) 1010 - as far as I know this hasn't been
investigated but on the other hand no one has complained of a problem linked to it. I'll try
to check it out.

Penny,
I attach the results of the query.

Note that on the advice of Alan all BAL events are included for the date range. They
are identified by a blank FAD. They may not be relevant for a Horizon counter.
