I thought we were not having signatures - it's not usual practice? (Other than Neil)

Hi,

Paula and Chris aren’t signing the Chief Execs and Financial review under current plans ~ just the balance
sheet - so she isn’t being left out. I think it should be all three of these or none at all and Neil’s was
different as it is a statutory requirement. There is nowhere logical to sign these three sections without
a signature point at the bottom so it would look odd. The signature section could be typed back in, as I
said below, but the final version needs to be landed with Merchant Cantos today to be ready so we need
a final decision on this very soon.

Regards,
Sarah

Feels odd that Alice is the only one not signing!

So although not a requirement I would include Alice especially as Neil has signed his (Yes I know that’s a
requirement!) just thinking about optics

Thanks

Hi Mark,

Following that discussion the whole typed sign off section was removed from the bottom of the
Chairman’s, Chief Execs, Financial Review and Directors Remuneration.

That left no logical place to put the signature so I asked Alwen’s team to check the requirements earlier
this week and there is no statutory requirement for the chairman’s or chief execs reports or financial
review to be signed. There is a requirement for the directors remuneration to be signed so we added
back Neil’s name and title into the report and he has signed that page (but only the typed name will
appear in the published version}, As we don’t need to do the other signatures we aren’t planning to sign
those pages(....unless you want to add back the typed sign off on the bottom of each?). I have
confirmed EY are satisfied with this approach.

The only statutory signatures required therefore are Paula’s and Chris’s on the consolidated and
company balance sheets and Alwen’s on the directors’ report.

Regards,
Sarah

I'm not sure I understand the point about removing Alice's signature?

We decided to remove all actual signatures from the published report based on advice from nick
Kennett.

So no signatures should actually appear in the published copy.

Hi all,

Neil has signed his pages and I am holding them until Tuesday as he’s away next

week. Karen is finalising the accounts with Merchant Cantos to have a final set available
for full signature on Monday. Angus Grant from EY is not available on Tuesday so he will
sign his pages on Monday afternoon (dated 16") and EY will hold them until they
receive our signed balance sheets. The only remaining signatures required are Paula’s,
Chris’s and Alwen’s (as the decision was taken to remove the sign off on Alice’s
Chairman’s report) and the I understand the pian is to do this at 9am on Tuesday before
the Board meeting. Alwen should be sending an invitation soon if that still works for
timing.

Angus has a call booked with Susan on Monday about the Horizon report but I think this
is just for completeness of their records as ry conversations with Jeremy, the senior
manager, confirmed that they agree with our view that there should be no provision.

We are nearly there!

Sarah

Hi all,

Following Chris and Mark’s guidance we are still going ahead. [t has just come up that
Neil McCausland is in France next week so we will be seeking his signature this week

POL-0098786
(dated 16 July) so that we have the full set of signatures once the others sign on 16
July. Ernst & Young are lined up to sign in the afternoon of 16 July.

i have sent EY the Second Sight report, our comments and our press release and had a
conversation with Jeremy, the senior manager. As expected they asked about

the impact on the accounts and I have assured him that we believe there is no impact.
Once they have read the report, Angus may ask for a call with Susan but hasn't done so
yet.

Regards,
Sarah

Subject: Signing the Annual Report and Accounts

Hello,

We need to confirm plans for signing the accounts if this is to take place at the Board
meeting on 16 July. There are some final checks that Ernst & Young need to do next
week on the final draft as well as last questions on events since the year end. We will
also need to insert the date in all the appropriate places and prepare the copies for
signing.

if we sign on 16 July the printed copies should be ready for publication in w/c 29 July but
this could be delayed until w/c 5 August if that was more convenient. As we have
discussed before, beyond that would be stretching it too long.

We have a statutory obligation to lodge the accounts with Companies House at which
point they are public and my understanding is that the deadline for that is 9 months
after year end although EY advised me that pics have to do this within 4 months. Not
that we want to follow Royal Mail necessarily...but the latest Royal Mail has published
was 26 October in 2007 but it is usually May or June. I understand that around 26 July is
still the plan for this year.

Please could you confirm if we should go ahead with the final checks with EY and
finalisation ready for 16 May signing?

Regards,
Sarah
