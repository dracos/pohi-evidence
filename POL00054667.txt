Introduction

[ve been asked to comment on_the Expert Witness report produced by Charles
Mclachlan in the case against SIME associated with Rinkfield

[only have a paper copy éf the report and started reading through it. 1 then realised
that some of it was familiar and so opened up an.catlier report produced by Prof
McLachlan for the West Byfleet case (2 Interim Reporb.

1 have carried out a quick comparison of the two report
identical (F would need a Word version of the Rin!
thoroughly). T'produced a Witness statement on 2" Feb 2010 which addr

West Byficet report and most of the comments in that still apply.

and to a large extent they are

Comments on new text

3.1 Section 2.2

1)

2.2.2 describes

sues with Travellers Cheques.

I don’t believe that this issue is described accurately. re anomalies in
the way in which the system stores details of Travellers Cheques and Currency
and reports on them. However although this may cause confusion, it does not
result in any losses.

I have conducted some experiments on a Horizon terminal and have some

detailed responses:

a. 2.2.2.1; When ‘TC Stock is remitted in, then the “Volume” represents,
the Currency Value of the Travellers Cheques (ic $500 in the example)
and the value is zero. Horizon doesn’t assign any value to a TC until it
is sold. This should be clear in the Remittance Receipt. If a Balance
Snapshot is done at this point than it will show a Balance of 500 US
dollar TCs. Nowhere in Horizon will the value 41 appear.

b. 2.2.2.3: Selling $50 of will change the Stock Quantity to $450 on.
the Balance Snapshot (or Stock on Hand Report) and also appear on
the TC Sales report correctly. However, I accept that on the Balance
Snapshot under the Receipts section it does show a Volume of 1
against the TC sales rather than 50. ‘This actually represents the fact
that there has been one Sale, but does not affect the actual Stock
Levels. It should also be noted that on this report there is a further
entry with zero value and a Volume of 1 that represents the change to
the change in the level of TC Stock. Again the Volume of one
represents a single sale and does not represent any value associated
with the Dollars TCs sold.

c. 2.2.2.4: Idon’t understand where this observation has come from.

de 2.2.2.5: TL agree that this would be nonsens
is not the case.

if this was the case, but it

e. 2.2.2.6: The system does allow negative stock values to be held ona
temporary basis. This is to allow stock to be sold before it has been
recorded on the system as having been remitted in. Also, as the system
does not keep running totals of the stock levels (but rather calculates
the level when requested by taking an Opening Figure and all
movements due to sales, Remittances etc), and so would be unable to
easily enforce preventing Stock levels from going negative. However I
agree that it makes no sense in the real world and any negative stock
levels need to be resolved before a Stock Unit can ¢ balanced.

1 don’t believe that th ue is described accurately. ‘The system docs not
allow the scenario as described to occur, However I can think of slight
variants on the scenario that could occur and can explain the behaviour of such
cases. Again, this would not result in any losses. to either the sub-postmaster

Section 7 consists of a number of bulleted items for possible further investigation.

In general I sce no problem with such investigations other than that they will require
significant resource and time to carryout and are unlikely to result in any further
clarity. T will comment on those that I see-as potentially affecting Pujit

1) Bullet Ls This may require co-operation from Fujitsu in providing logs for
comparison. Note that given HING-X is in mid roll-out then this is unlikely to
be of any benctit unless done in the next week or two.as rollout is due to
complete in August 2010.

2) Bullet 2: I’m not sure that we are in a position to do this for the Horizon
system. The UI was based on Escher’s Riposte and an agreed style Guide
with POL.

3) Bullet 3: I don’t know if such logs exist
4) Bullet 4: This is a normal ARQ L believe
5) Bullets 5, 6, 8 to 11: these are for POL and not Fujitsu

6) Bullet 7: Not sure exactly what is required here. It sounds like details of
Banking Reconciliation reports relating to the Branches. Not sure if these are
easy / possible to provide or for how long they are retained.

7) Bullet 12: Not sure about scope of this. Is it just counter fixes for that
Branch?

8) Bullet 13: [thought I'd covered this in a Witness statement for West Byfleet.

‘The rest of section 7 is various press cuttings. Finally there are 2 almost legible pages
that describe how Charles thinks a Card Payment system works, but is nothing like
Horizon.
