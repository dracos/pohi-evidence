Exec Summary of position

Back
Office

Network
Tower

EUC

Horizon
Anywhere

No active transition activity is now required

Horizon contract extended

Base assumptions in Trinity —

* HNGX counter application retired by March 17 and superseded by HNGA
* BNS solution provided by new network provider from March 17

* Test rig service contract obligation to extend beyond March 17

POL are planning to Exit POLSAP Apps before Hosting — Hosting extension past 31st March 17

Exit note for Application States 5th Oct 16 transfer date

Credence/MDM Hosting being extended, 6 months current estimate with Option to terminate early

Fujitsu working closely with Back Office on POLSAP and Credence migrations to develop creative solutions for the tight
schedule

Service continuity remains a concern due to challenging schedules

Post Office have not determined the timing, scope or nature of network transition and Fujitsu is not currently in Exit
Post Office have requested an extension of the BNS, CMT and OBC services past March 17

Authorisation to start the HNGX study is imminent, but the more critical BNS study remains outstanding. This is a pre-
requisite for the extensions noted above past March 17

POL have decided to return to Computacenter for Branch Counter Refresh solution as of 1 July 17

ATP now signed and reengagement underway initially to revalidate the requirements

Planning reengagement underway but significant dependencies remain with other suppliers before a plan can be fully
developed

Works left unfinished as a consequence of the hold on CT1944 will now need to be progressed

Issues and Risks € rufirsu

= Transition

= Major Risk: POL transition plans complete BIP roll-out in October 2017. Fujitsu HNGX counter and BNS services end in March 17.
No solution has yet been agreed to address this gap. Action required now to maintain Branch service

= A number of extensions POLSAP hosting , Credence Extension, HNGX and potentially networks will drive extension or
replacement of legacy components and impact needs to be reviewed and agreed holistically. (In the Power down of the DR site a
considerable number of components failed on startup, 9 disks, several blades and routers due to age. )

= Commercial, Quality & Compliance
= Outstanding Purchase Orders value of £555k plus 2" quarter cover for CT1848
m= Unpaid invoices unresolved at £902km (June £868k, May £693k, April £682k)
= Patching continues to be deployed to Live service within target (90 days) of availability from 3 Parties

= Outstanding CTs and CCNs
= EUC ATP not progressed

= 11 CTs where work done but commercials not signed totalling £379k. Includes CT2062b HNGA Hardware Support Continuation,
CT2104a for support to POL Remediation Activity and Bluecoat appliances are now technically unlicensed from a support
perspective

@ Service

= Portable Appliance Testing of Devices in Branch ( last performed in 2011) Rom submitted as requested.

= Reference Data open loop and historic items. Compounded with move of team on basis Horizon ending In progress fortnightly
meetings with Atos and POL

= Branch Network expires March 2017
= Forward schedule of change now completely full to end of year
= Service Descriptions need sign off

= End to End model

= Now that transition has commenced with EUC tower and Sl/Service Desk in place, Fujitsu are no longer responsible for end to end
model. Governance/ review is required. Example — pin pads being moved in branches, decommissioned PCs (counters) still on
network, security model etc
