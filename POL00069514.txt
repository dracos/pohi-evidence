I had a telephone conversation with Helen Rose (her call) coming back to me on a voicemail
I had left with her. She had read the latest version of the statement and she thought that it
was better in terms of the balance snapshots.

However she wanted to make a further change to paragraph 8. She said that as soon as
the sub postmaster was suspended, the compliance test then became irrelevant. Had it been
a normal audit ie had Castleton been carrying on, the test would have been completed and
the sub postmaster would have been told to get his act together, but she wanted to
emphasise that the compliance test failure werenâ€™t themselves the reason he was dismissed.
He was dismissed because of the loss of stock.

Confirming that I was going to speak to counsel about the statements this morning and I
would email her an amended version.
