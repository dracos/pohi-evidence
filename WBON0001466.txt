David, Gideon
Would you mind reviewing the attached over the weekend?

This is a very early and initial summary of the key findings in the Judgment. PO have asked for something
like this by close on Sunday so that they can start mitigation planning on Monday morning.

I would very much like to be able to say that you agree with me on point 1.6 but do say if you don't.
