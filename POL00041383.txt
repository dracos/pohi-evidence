One could say (especially if a pedant) that it’s not part of Horizon’s functionality....

All
Deloitte have approved the remote access section save for one minor change ~— to add the words in yellow:

Except for Global User access and Balancing Transactions, Horizon is designed so that transactions recorded on
Horizon that make up a branch's accounts are either input or approved by branch staff before they form part of the
relevant accounts.

The reason for this change is that one could arguably say that a transaction that has been amended using administrator
access has not been approved by branch staff. However, administrator access is not part of the system as designed, but
a tool to change the system. Hence, the above wording clarifies this point.

Kind regards

Rodric ~ it's just the remote access section (copy attached). There are no other parts of the letter that deal with Horizon /
technical material on which Deloitte / FJ could have any informed input.

i think that makes sense, but could you please send me the paragraph numbers so I can see what it is we are relying on
Deloitte for instead of FJ?

Subject: FJ approval of letter [BD-4A.FID26896945]

Jane, Rod
Rob and I have spoken re the need for Fu's approval of our letter.

Rob's preference would be to send the letter past FJ but we recognise the time pressure and the reality that FU will not
turn this around in 24 hours. So, the pian is that, as long as Deloitte give us the ail clear (which then m ises the risk of
there being any factual errors), then the letter can go without Fu’s prior approval. This leaves a residual risk that FJ may
complain / disagree with the letter but, in my view, it is an acceptably small one.

We will copy the letter (as sent) to FJ so that they are in the loop and can comment if they wish.
I've sent the fetter to Deloitte for their comments. They should respond today.

Rob ~ is this a fair summary?

Jane / Rod - are you happy with this approach?

Kind regards
Andy
