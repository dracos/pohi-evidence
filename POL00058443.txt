Further to my Statement of 24" June 2009, I would now like to add the following.

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services (Fujitsu), Post Office Account, since 11 March 2002
as an IT Security Analyst where I am involved in IT Security for the Post Office Account. I
have a working knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a
computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised by Fujitsu to
undertake extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system and to obtain information

regarding system transaction information processed on the Horizon system.

I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.
Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to the business
of Fujitsu. These were compiled during the ordinary course of business from information
supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of
the matter dealt with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of
the information or cannot be traced, since the nature of the helpdesk involves many engineers
all at differing levels and any number could be involved in a particular call. As part of my
duties, I have access to these records, but I was not involved with any of the technical aspects
of these calls. This area is not my particular area of expertise and I make this witness
statement simply to help clarify the call logs for the benefit of the Court.

Continuation of statement of Andy Dunks

An important element of the support provided to sub-postmasters and Counter Clerks is the
Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). The HSH is the Horizon user's first ‘port of call’ in the event
of their experiencing a problem with the Horizon system or requiring advice and guidance. If
the system were to malfunction, Upon discovery the Horizon users (i.e. the sub-postmaster or
counter clerk) would raise a call to the HSH seeking clarification or advice. HSH is a service
run by Fujitsu Services for the Post Office. I have been asked to provide information pertaining
the working condition of the Horizon system. The following information constitutes the calls
logged by HSH recorded during the period January 1st 2005 to June 30th 2005 for the West
Byfleet Post Office - Branch Code 126023.

I have reviewed the HSH calls pertaining to the West Byfleet branch during the period
January 1st 2005 to June 30th 2005. There were 13 calls from branch Code 126023 to the
HSH. All the calls are of a routine nature and do not fall outside the normal working
parameters of the system or would affect the working order of the counters.

Call reference details and an overview of each call are given in date order below:

There are a many abbreviations that the HSH use in their call details, here are many

explained:

NBSC - Network Business Support Centre

PM - Post Master

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account since May 2005. I perform the
role of Service Delivery Manager and am responsible for service delivery of all Post Office
change. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a
computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd and knowledge of the processes
used when Horizon kit is uplifted from closing Post Office Branches.

Horizon’s documented procedures stipulate how the Horizon System operates, and while I am
not involved with any of the technical aspects of the Horizon System, these documented
processes allow me to provide a general overview.

The serial number of the Gateway PC base unit at West Byfleet Branch (FAD Code 126023) is
YBSHO011567 and I have documentation from Triage Services confirming repair and software
reload of this unit prior to its deployment to the West Byfleet Branch.

On arrival at Triage Services on the 23rd of January 2008 base unit YBSHO11567 was
subjected to a standard clean, test, and application reinstallation as per standard process,
Triage Services state that no malfunctions were found and as a result no repairs were carried
out to this unit and it was placed in storage awaiting redeployment.

All relevant data is held on Triages Services “MAX” system database.

The base unit with serial number YBSH011567 was finally redeployed to West Byfleet Office,
Branch Code 126023 on the 4th February 2008 and since its installation the Branch Manager
at this address has logged 29 Service Calls with the Fujitsu Services Horizon Help Desk. Once
redeployment has taken place all previous location history is overwritten on the Fujitsu
