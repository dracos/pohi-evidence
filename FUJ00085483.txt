OG : Good morning. Please can we have an update on the progress of this issue.
0112-08-29 14:44:25 [ Fenning, Sue Joy]

OG : This issue relates to source data received in POLSAP from Horizon via the
LE files. The affected profit centre (branch) is 020511 and general ledger
ccount 627237 : Post & Go PING Matching.

similar incidents was previously investigated re. branches 007113 & 200518 which
as now cleared (A1040049 refers).

n example the customer has provided shows amounts of £115.05, £46.88, £52.13 &
75.23 totalling £289.29 received on the file from Wincor and into POLSAP via BLE.

he same (contra) amounts are also showing as being received from the branch when
the TA has been accepted and are closed items in the account (netted off to 0.00).
jowever, there is another amount of £289.29 which just has the date in the
ssignment field.

he TA?s seem to be going out to the branch OK and being accepted but POLSAP is
lso receiving a reversal amount on the file as well.

urther details below:-

jlocument Date : 09.08.2012 (POLSAP document no. 8005592079)
n Idoc generated from the BLE file contained values of:-

Hh15.05 (DR), assignment PG 3 50865919 (TA out

75.23 (CR), assignment PG_3 50865922 (TA accepted)
otal value 289.29 (CR)

he values with an assignment of PG_3_xxxxxxxx are expected to match and clear
iving an overall balance of 0.00 which has happened. Assignment value
IPG_3_xxxxxxxx is passed through on the file.

he Customer is querying why there is an additional posting of 289.29 with a
lefault date assignment i.e. 20120809. What is the source of this reversal amount
ontained in the same BLE file?

Its the data coming from Wincor? Did something change at branch 020511 (The
alleries) in July?

his only appears to be happening for branch 020511, other occurrences are from

[Start of Response]

Postings on the TfS call refer to a similar previous incident (A1040049 => Peak
PCO0219432), which was resolved between POL and Wincor Nixdorf; no details of this
resolution are available to us.

his incident is a week old, but only came to SSC late last night.

[The trading-date in this call, 2012-08-09, is three weeks ago which too old for us
ito be able to see the incoming file from Wincor Nixdorf.

hecking the BLE file for FAD 020511 for 2012-08-09 (IF20120809005.BLE):
the PG entries are:

here is no evidence of a fault in HNG-X, and without the incoming file from

resolved before closing this call.

jorizon is receiving PG data for 6 separate PG tills at the branch, but only 4 of
them have associated stock units. This causes the entire subfile for the branch to
© Held, and the transaction data is not being sent to POLSAP. However the TA data
for the 4 tills which are properly associated IS being sent through, and I think
this is probably the cause of the POLSAP anomalies.

he two unassociated tills are not doing any cash transactions - this is a known
roblem (see PC0218702), and means the PM isn't prompted to create an association.
his may need fixing via MSC.

ther branches on the report may also need similar action. We have found that
007113 has been closed for 18 months, so the PG txns were misdirected, but I don't
nderstand exactly what happened (see question at end of first evidence file).

Following a change made centrally to facilitate this, the stock unit associations
for the two new Post and Go terminals have been created by the branch and all the
eld external data (43 different days) has now been processed and passed through
to POLSAP in BLE file IF20120914005.BLE.

je strongly recommend that POL monitor the SubfilesOnHold report which is sent to

them daily, so that any other external terminals with problems can be investigated
wickly in case a similar correction is needed.
