FYI below and attached -— this is the original Helen Rose report and the original email chain. I can't find anything after this
date in our records as I think that Rodric took over from this point. Clearly at some point this document went to CK and
CK produced the attached advice in July 2013 that triggered the disclosures of the report to some convicted SPMRs.

The report did appear to include an Appendix — not sure why this was redacted when sent out by CK. I'll send an email to
Simon Clarke asking for his thoughts on this.

Please note that Dave's comment below about this report not relating to a Spot Review is incorrect — this is Spot Review
1, which fully explains the issues being raised by Helen Rose in her report.

Kind regards
Andy

Rodric,

Please find associated a report from our Fraud Analyst, Helen Rose, in respect of
Lepton SPSO. This office doesn’t feature as part of our 2™ Sight Spot Reviews,
but the subject matter is Horizon (and indeed Credence) related. Could I ask
that you consider the report and feed any comments back, as it could be a
potential issue at some stage.

In summary, the specifics concern a ‘system reversal’ of a transaction following
a system failure. This is normal practice, but the Horizon logs (and Credence
logs) indicate that the reversal is an ‘existing reversal’, implying that the
reversal was manually entered by the clerk/Subpostmaster.

I think there’s a remote possibility that this could be a problem in terms of
using the data for evidence/prosecution purposes, but nevertheless it is still a
possibility. Myself or Helen are happy to talk through anything that requires
explanation.

Regards,

Dave Posnett I Accredited Financial Investigator
