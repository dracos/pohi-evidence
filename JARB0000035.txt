Mr Alan Bates
Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance

GRO

Iam extremely grateful to you for coming to the meeting this morning, which I thought
went very well indeed. Until you mentioned your own case, I had no idea how affected your
life has been by this issue. It is no wonder that you feel impelled to help others who have
found themselves in the same situation, and you have my admiration for this.

I hope that now the Post Office can edge towards an agreed understanding with you and
the Alliance. It is in everyone's interest that it does so. I hope also that my suggestion that
you both deal directly with each other was not misconstrued. I much prefer direct dealings
in most things, as in this way, fewer misunderstandings tend to arise, and the task at hand
gets accomplished much more swiftly. I am, of course, happy to step in and help if and
when it is felt that this might be needed.

My office will continue to pass to the Post Office those cases that come to us via MP’s
offices. I would be pleased if you were to simply keep me informed about progress from
your end, so that I know what the state of play is. I have a great deal of interest in this
issue, and hope that now we are underway, a resolution will appear within the not-too-
distant future.

Thank you for all your effort thus far.
