Desktop Components

3.1 Introduction

This chapter describes in more detail the visual components that are used to build the
Desktop screens.

As described in Chapter 2, screens are composed of a number of panels, scripts and
buttons that are assembled into named component types known as OCXs. OCXs are
provided as a toolbox for application developers to use in building their applications.

Application developers select the OCXs that are appropriate for each application and
Riposte controls others that maintain the consistent behaviour and appearance of the
Desktop.

This chapter is organised as follows:

3.2. Summary of OCX types and usage

The OCX types used are as follows:

e The Calendar and Clock OCX display the date and time in the stack estate when the

stack does not contain any transactions. Application developers do not need to
specify its use, as it is entirely controlled by Riposte.

e The Help OCX provides information about any screen object that the user selects.
Information is displayed in a speech bubble with a yellow background. Application
developers supply the text and the Help OCX controls how and where on the

screen it is displayed. The Help OCX can be invoked by selecting the ‘Info’ button.

e Card and Button OCXs are used to offer options to the user. The Card OCX is a
simple button that the user touches to make a selection. A Button OCX has an
identical function but has a more complicated format with a tabbed caption.

e The Trans OCX is used for all panels that display information to the user, but
cannot be altered or selected. It is normally displayed with a Card OCX to enable
the user to react to the displayed information.

e The Script OCX is a panel that tells the user what data to enter and how to
proceed. It is always displayed with one of the input OCX types: Calculator,
Options or Message/Error.

e The Calculator OCX is a standard display format used to enter alphanumeric data.
e The Options OCX enables the user to make a selection from a list of alternatives.

© The Message/Error OCX gives information about a transaction or an error, and
offers one or two courses of action.

e The List OCX provides a structured list format with navigation and search
facilities. It has a number of uses, including the provision of Product Look-Up and
Declaration lists.

Table 3-1 summarises how and where these OCXs are used. Section 3.3 gives more
details and an illustration of each type.

Table 3-1 OCX types and uses

Each OCX has a complex set of properties, some of which may be specified by
applications programmers. For example, the Trans OCX may use a number of different
panel styles. This chapter gives a brief description of each OCX type and the guidelines
for its use. Chapter 4 describes the panel and button styles that determine the
appearance of OCXs.

3.3.1.1 Description

The Calendar and Clock OCX display the date and time and additional reminders: the
stock unit in use, the user, stock unit type, the current cash account and balance period
and the current transaction mode. Their format and display are managed completely by
the Desktop and are not under the control of application programmers.

3.3.1.2 Guideline

The Calendar and Clock OCX display the time and date. This OCX is displayed on the
stack estate when there are no transactions on the stack and is not directly controlled
by the programmer.

3.3.3, Card OCX

Figure 3-3 Card OCX

3.3.3.1 Description

The Card OCX is a simple form of command button. When it is selected, an event is
triggered.

The Card OCX is used for all menu buttons and for option buttons on transaction
screens like F1 - F5 in Figure 3-13. Each Card OCX displays a picture file, a caption
and a key name. It may also have a shortcut key defined.

See Chapter 4 for details of styles that can be used in the Card OCX.

3.3.3.2. Guidelines

e All simple options are displayed using a Card OCX. Several Card OCXs can be
displayed on one screen if there is more than one choice that the user can make.

e A Card OCX can display more than one icon and caption if it is being used for a
sequence of related actions.

e If, when the Card OCX is selected, the user has to wait while the system processes
the request, the user must be made aware of the fact. The Wait data type (egg-timer
icon) is used to display an explanatory message: ‘Checking for negative stock...’,
for example.

3.3.4 Button OCX

Figure 3-4 Button OCX

3.3.4.1 Description

The Button OCX is similar to the Card OCX but is more flexible and more complex;
for example, it has more than one icon position. The Finish button displays a pound
sign as well as the accounting sense of the transaction ‘PAY’ or ‘TAKE’. The caption
and key name are displayed at the top of the button on a tab that is capable of
displaying a longer caption than is possible with the Card OCX.

3.3.4.2 Guideline

The Button OCX is used for transactions on the stack and for the Finish button. It may
be used in other positions if it is necessary to display a longer caption than is possible
with a Card OCX, or additional text fields.

3.3.5.1 Description

The Trans OCX is a panel that displays information to the user. It is for information
only and cannot be selected or used for entering input. In Figure 3-5, the Produce
Report panel is a Trans OCX and displays details of the report selection criteria.

See Chapter 4 for details of panel styles that can be used in the Trans OCX.

3.3.5.2 Guideline

The Trans OCX is used to display information clearly, at a point in a dialogue where
the user needs to select options. It is used in conjunction with at least one Card OCX,
which enables the user to respond to the displayed information.

3.3.6.1 Description

The Script OCX controls user input. It consists of a panel with a caption, prompts for
user input, and areas that echo the data entered.

In Figure 3-6, the right-hand panel is a Script OCX. The name entered in the User
Name field of the left-hand panel (Calculator OCX) is also displayed in the User Name
field of the right-hand panel (Script OCX) when the user touches the tick or presses
Enter.

Figure 3-7 illustrates how the Script OCX continues to display the completed Name
field when the left-hand panel has changed to process the user’s password.

When a number of actions have to be performed by the user, each action on the Script
OCX is highlighted in turn.

When the user is asked to input data, the text of the Script OCX is kept as concise as
possible and repeated on the Caption of the matching Calculator OCX.

3.3.7 Calculator OCX

3.3.7.1 Description
The Calculator OCX enables users to enter the following data types:

e Alphanumeric

e Date
© Numeric
e Currency

Details of how each of these data types is handled are given in Chapter 5.

The Calculator OCX is normally used in conjunction with a Script OCX, which
displays instructions and also the data that has been entered so far. The user is
presented with a numeric or alphanumeric keypad, as appropriate. Figure 3-6 shows a
Calculator OCX that accepts alphanumeric input; the OCX shown in Figure 3-8 is used
for numeric input.

The Calculator OCX adjusts the size of the data input area to match the maximum size
that is defined in the application. The associated MaxLength parameter is used by
application developers to ensure that the input area exactly fits (if possible within the
constraints of the panel size) the maximum length of the data to be displayed or input.
Associated with the parameter is an audible indicator (bleep) that warns the user that
maximum length has been exceeded and that the data that is being entered currently
will be ignored. The bleep also warns a user who tries to delete more characters than
are present in an input field.

The user enters the data; any mistakes can be corrected either by touching the cross,
which removes all the entered characters, or by using the back arrow button to delete
individual characters up to, and including, the mistake. There is no mechanism for
correcting a single character in the middle of a field, other than by deleting all the
characters that follow it.

When the user touches the tick (or presses Enter) to indicate that data entry is
complete for the current field, the data field is validated. The nature of the validation
depends upon the application.
