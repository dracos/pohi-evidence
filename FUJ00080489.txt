1 Introduction

The purpose of this document is to define the incident handling scope of the
Horizon System Helpdesk. It details the call sources and incident types
expected from those sources. The grouping of incidents contained within this
document reflect the sources of callers into the HSH and the incident types as
defined in the NR2 PPD document set.

The document will be used as the control point for all incidents handled by
the Horizon System Helpdesk. All future growth in incident sources will be
sized, evaluated and reflected in this document to ensure effective support is
identified in advance of incident handling.

This document underpins the Horizon System Helpdesk PPD and it is
underpinned by several other documents that describe incident prioritisation,
incident coding and incident routing through the ICL Pathway support
structure. The complete document set is designed to scope the operation of
the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH) and is used to manage incidents
through the ICL Pathway support structure.

2 Scope

The document reflects the anticipated steady state operation of ICL Pathway
from NR2 onwards.

The Horizon System Helpdesk provides a the single contact point for all
technical problems arising within the ICL Pathway operating domain, from
outlets, POCL and its clients where there are links into the ICL Pathway
systems and for reconciling data or information across those links as
business incidents.

The document describes at a high level those types of incidents likely to be
made from these pre-determined sources and is supported by the outlet
counter procedures and documentation. It identifies call types from POCL or
POCL Client systems for technical or business reconciliation incidents, which
are reported from, agreed sources or helpdesks within POCL or its Clients.
These sources operate within these agreed call types and use the same
incident matrix approach to incident management. The matrix also describes
incidents reported from users and support groups operating within the ICL
Pathway environment.

ICL Pathway support

Technical support for the ICL Pathway operation is provided by various
suppliers working together to provide a complete and seamless service. The
support structure is divided into different skill areas and to different levels of
expertise.

Support or request for information is obtained by calling the Horizon System
Helpdesk on i The Horizon System Helpdesk provides first
level support for all technical issues. The Horizon System Helpdesk staff will
record details of the issue or request by ascertaining information from the
customer regarding the nature and impact of the problem, the helpdesk
operator will be able to resolve or diagnose the problem during this initial
telephone conversation. Should the operator fail to resolve the problem at this
time, he will route the incident onto a second line support unit and inform the
customer of the next expected action.

ICL Pathway call profiles

All valid calls to the Horizon System Helpdesk will be recorded as incidents
and allocated an incident number. Each incident is allocated a separate
number and not grouped as one incident (For example, an Outlet Manager
with two printers broken will be given two separate incident numbers).

Once closed, an incident may not be reopened. Any further incidents with the
operation or equipment will be registered as a new incident.

Call severity and prioritisation

All incidents recorded at the Horizon System Helpdesk will be allocated a
priority level dependent on the nature and importance of the incident.

Priority levels range from A through to C and each level is subject to a
different target resolution to fix time, these target times are controlled by
contractual or Service Level Agreement (SLA) targets.

For example an A priority incident relating to a hardware problem in a Post
Office is allocated a target call to resolution time of 4 hours.

Call sources and classification

Incidents types contained within this document are aligned to the operational
and support activities surrounding the ICL Pathway services and estate. The
sources of calls to the HSH are pre-identified and have been equipped with
procedures of logging an incident on the HSH. As each incident is registered
the HSH operator will diagnose the nature and area of the incident and
classify the incident as one of the following classifications:

e Hardware

© Software

e Network

e Operation

e Security

« Advice and Guidance
e Reconciliation

e Implementation

e Change (planned or unplanned)
« Documentation

9  POCL client interface incidents

9.1

POCL client interface systems operational incidents

This section deals with incidents that affect the organisational and data interfaces into ICL Pathway, they are typically incidents that are
reported by the NBSC helpdesk and MUST be cross referenced to a corresponding incident number on the other desk. OSD operations
or SSC may also report against these incident categories, if so, an incident will be logged by HSH on the corresponding helpdesk. The
protocols surrounding escalation and prioritisation of these incidents are outlined in the SCOP (Reference PDA/SVM/CP/001) and it is
intended to agree them in detail in operational Level Agreements between ICL Pathway and the various client organisations.
