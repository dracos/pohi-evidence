Subject: James Arbuthnot - Meeting with MP's

Alice and I have agreed that we will follow the well worn path for the above meeting and will attempt to replicate how the
conversation went with JA/OL.

Please can Alwen update/re-shape the briefing note. The rough outline of the JA/OL meeting was as follows:
« JA — Overall introduction
* Alice intro — take the issues seriously etc
+ Paula follow on — confirm this and outline the challenges we face in addressing these issues and how we plan to
explain to them the integrity of the system and the improvements that have been made in our
training/support/escalation processes.
* Angela — talk through two or three anonymous examples
+ JA-— explain how he was persuaded/reassured and to present his recommendations of a forensic accountant
+ Paula — explain/offer to investigate MP’s individual cases and have the process validated by the FA.
* Alice/JA — gain agreement/finish meeting

Alwen — I'm sure it would be helpful to you if you and I grab 10 mins over the next couple of days just to go through this.
Thanks in advance for your help.

Finally, we need to pull together the brief/timing for the FA and Alice and we have agreed that either one of us (whoever
has the diary availability) should ‘interview’ the individual , so that we are happy with their engagement as well as
technical ability. Who will progress the brief/timing? I have just noticed that we have committed to go to the MP meeting,
having found a FA suitable to carry out the task. Susan can you help with this? Any queries at all please don't hesitate to
ask as this is really important — it may be just what we need to resolve the outstanding challenges on horizon.

p.s. Just to be on the safe side I'll ask Mia if its possible for the 4 of us to arrange a conference call for Friday.
