There were a number of unreasonable requests made by the defence which after consultation with various
departments, including Andy Winn have beén refused by Legal Services. If the defence wish to pursue these
avenues then they would have to apply to the judge as to why. they require this information and it would then
be up to him to decide whether their requests should be provided by Post Office® Ltd.

[have copied a paragraph from the e-mail sent by Jarnail Singh, Post Office®:Solicitor to me , which confirms
the above. The e-mail was sent on the 28th July 2010 and I have not been informed of any response to it
from the defence.

“Our view in respect of the access to the system in the Midlands and Chesterfield is that this is exactly the
‘same information or material they were seeking before and as they were told previously that if they want
disclosure of these items which we feel is not relevant that we are not prepared to disclose these and we are
under no obligation to grant them access as they require and if they wish they can make a Section 8
application to the Court. I confirm that I have accordingly written to them on these lines”.

Hi John

‘The last update I had on the above was in July, the Defence Solicitors had requested they had access to the
operations in Chesterfield. This was discussed by Andy Winn/ Rod Ismay. I have today spoken with Andy
Winn and he has informed me that Rod had made a decision to not allow this. Therefore could you please
update me with the latest progress on the case.

Kind regards
