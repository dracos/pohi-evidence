POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF DAPHNE COURTNEY

|, Daphne Courtney, will say as follows...
INTRODUCTION

1. | was a Counter Clerk at Honiton Post Office for approximately 28 years.

2. | was a Horizon Field Support Officer for approximately 2 years, along with
other members of the team. We were given training before going out to
various Post Offices to support Postmasters during the transition from paper
based to computer based. We had a Team Leader,

3. The hours worked varied - some days would be normal office hours, but some
days we would start about 16.30 and possibly work until midnight.

4. Some Postmasters who had previously used a computer found the
experience easy. But others without any computer knowledge found it really
quite difficult. Also Postmasters who worked alone found things more difficult
than those in a team who had other people to question about less common
transactions. There would be extra help for the Postmasters on their first
balancing day after the Horizon installation. So for some people the support
was sufficient, but others were going to struggle.

5. | was not aware of any errors or glitches in the system.
