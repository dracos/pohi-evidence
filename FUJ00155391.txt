Please see note below from Anne, and attached spreadsheet containing events which remain after known event filters
have been applied. This data covers 2006-7, which is not unusual. Anne's comments need to be part of our
discussion tomorrow.

Kind regards
Penny

Branch 132001:

Counter 3 had disk errors and was replaced on 12/10/2006.
Further counter 3 disk errors 24/3/2007 - this time cleared by a reboot.
FUJ00155391
FUJ00155391

Counter 1 Lock event writing checkpoint 4/4/2007 02:30 - I think safe to assume this is benign.

When such long periods are covered, especially at branches with many counters, there are almost certainly
going to be some events which look alarming but are, as far as I'm concerned, not particularly unusual over
the estate as a whole. We wouldn't normally investigate them unless there were some grounds for thinking
they had caused a problem - maybe because the PM queried something, or something showed up on the
reconciliation stream.

Trying to justify and assess them so long afterwards, without knowing what / when the problem was, is not
feasible. While I'm happy to help out with this in the short term, I think I'm being pulled much further into
this than I should be. So someone is going to have to work out what Security's approach to this is. In the
meantime perhaps we should just continue to check the lock events since those are the ones which have
been proved to be associated with a financial problem in a handful of cases.

Any thoughts?
