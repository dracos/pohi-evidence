Subjec Horizon Comms Call
t

No problem Mark.
I appreciate it's tricky with everyone's busy diaries. But in order to manage this reputational issue
most effectively, our top priority will be to ensure everyone can attend one conference call a day for
the next four working days, to ensure there is one forum for important decision making about our
Communications approach, as publication date draws near.

As Mark says, it would be great to have you all available at this daily conference call so we can also
integrate Portland into our discussions and properly benefit from their independent perspective. It may
only require 10 or 15 minutes on some days.

May I suggest an agenda along the following lines:

1. Media Strategy - Mark

Overall approach

Statement update

Q&A update

2. Internal Communications - Richard

3. Stakeholder Relations - Mike

4. AOB

Lesley, Alwen, Mark, Martin and Susan - given that your diaries are likely to be the most busy, are your
PAs able to co-ordinate the best times? we'll then flex our diaries to accommodate.

Thank you everyone
Nina
