Dear Ruth

Post Office Limited v Mr L Castleton

I refer to our telephone conversation today.

As discussed, I enclose two copies of what should hopefully be the final version of your witness statement
for approval. I have amended paragraph 9(c) to reflect the fact that you prepared the weekly cash
account on Thursday mornings as opposed to Wednesday and that the reboot therefore happened on
Thursday 1 April 2004.

If you are completely happy with the witness statement, please sign and date both copies and return one
copy to me at the above address.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible and thank you in anticipation of your assistance.
Kind regards

Yours sincerely

Stephen Dilley
Solicitor
for and on behalf of Bond Pearce LLP
