All

Ron has asked for more information about the problems we discussed a month or so ago.

I plan on sending him the attached report. I would also like to send him the letters we sent to sub postmasters for the
receipts payment problem but will need to ask Rod for these.

For discussion at our Friday 10am meeting.
Simon

Simon: you mentioned to me, about three weeks ago, two system defects or bugs. You said they had affected about 64
SPMRs as I recall. One had led to a £9,000 or so shortfall that had been investigated by Andy Winn and, as I understood
you to say, that amount had been written off and then later discovered to have been caused by the defect/bug.

Now here's the point: lan and I agree that those two defects need to be mentioned in the Interim Report. POL is going to
have to disclose them.

What we will need therefore is a short, clear, report on what happened. We will need that next week in order to cover the
matter in the Interim Report and the July 8th Meeting.

Hope you can do that.
Thanks and regards.

Ron.
