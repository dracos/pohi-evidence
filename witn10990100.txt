                          POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                 FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF HARRY BOWYER




I, Harry Bowyer, will say as follows:



INTRODUCTION

1.     I am a former employee of Cartwright King Solicitors (CK) and held the

        position of in-house barrister. I was made a director of the firm during the period

        covered by this Inquiry (one of about 30 — I held no equity in the firm).



2.     This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

       (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 26th

       February 2024 (the "Request").



BACKGROUND



3.     I joined CK in the summer of 2008 from the independent Bar where I had been

       in practice since 1990 (called in 1989). My practice was entirely criminal and

                                        Page 1 of 38
                                                                                          WITN10990100
                                                                                    WITN10990100




       included both prosecution and defence.

4.     When I joined CK I was the first employed barrister in the firm but over the

       next few years the firm expanded their advocacy department by employing a

       large number of barristers and solicitors with higher rights to cover almost the

       entirety of their Crown Court work. CK would still brief out work that was a

       long way from their offices.

5.     When I joined CK they had 3 offices, Nottingham, Derby and Leicester. They

       embarked on a period of rapid expansion by acquiring other firms of solicitors.

      At their peak they had around 20 offices from London to Newcastle. This

       involved a great deal of fairly ruthless reorganization as they cut away the

       dead wood.

6.    The Advocacy department at its peak was based in Nottingham and run as far

      as possible like a set of chambers. The Nottingham Office had an area for the

      advocates, the clerking team and any pupils. The Head of the Department

       was initially one of the Equity Partners, Steve Gelsthorpe. This was then taken

      on by Andy Cash and latterly by Mark Hopwell.

7.    I handed in my 3 months' notice at CK in December 2015 and left just before

       that expired in February/March 2016.



Relationship between Cartwright King ("CK") and Post Office Limited ("POL")



8.    I did have some involvement with POL prior to April 2012 which came about

      as Andy Cash introduced the then Royal Mail Group (RMG) work to CK. He

       was based in the Derby office but spent a great deal more time in Nottingham

       when he became head of the Advocacy department. The RMG work was more
                                      Page 2 of 38

                                                                                  WITN10990100




      provincial at that stage but in 2012 Andy Cash brought the POL work into the

      firm which was nationwide in nature.

9.    The bulk of the POL/RMG work was done by Martin Smith, based in Derby

      and Andrew Bolc based in Leicester. They would prepare the cases and brief

      them out to counsel. The RMG work involved some of the same type of cases

      as the later POL work but also involved postmen stealing from the mail.

10.   When he was in Nottingham Andy Cash would ask my opinion about the

      POL/RMG cases both informally and, on occasion he would ask me to settle

      an indictment or an advice on evidence. This would involve the file being

      brought to Nottingham so that I could work on it. It would then be returned to

      the lawyer working on it and I would be unlikely to see it again as it would

      usually be briefed out to counsel.

11.   During my time at CK I never prosecuted a trial for either RMG or POL. I

      prosecuted a sentence at Nottingham Crown Court — I cannot remember the

      name and I appeared more regularly, after we stopped the prosecutions, at

      directions hearings to adjourn cases when we thought that a new expert was

      to be instructed to replace Gareth Jenkins.

12.   I prosecuted one case which involved the manager of a Crown Post Office

      (i.e. a Post Office run by POL not a sub postmaster) after we stopped

      prosecuting the Horizon cases as that case did not rely upon Horizon

      evidence.

13.   I have been asked to set out who I worked with at CK on POL cases. Initially,

      as above, my main contact was with Andy Cash who asked me for early

      advices, advices on evidence and to settle indictments on an ad hoc basis

      when he was in Nottingham. I had a full criminal case load at this time and the
                                   Page 3 of 38
                                                                                       WITN10990100
                                                                                     WITN10990100




      RMG/POL requests were sporadic. Martin Smith and Andrew Bolc had the

      conduct of the files and I had little to do with either of them before 2012 except

      when I visited the Derby and Leicester Offices when I had work at the Crown

      Courts in those cities.

14.   The situation changed in late June 2013 just before the Second Sight Interim

      report was published. We became aware at CK through conversations that

      Martin Smith had with senior POL executives that the Second Sight Interim

      Report would reveal the existence of bugs in the Horizon system.

15.   Simon Clarke, one of the in-house barristers at CK, had been briefed in an

      Horizon case and discovered through a conversation with Gareth Jenkins that

      Gareth Jenkins knew of the matters that were to be mentioned in the Second

      Sight Interim Report of 81h July 2013 and had failed to disclose them.

16.   Simon became the head of the Post Office Department shortly afterwards and

      instituted the Sift program to make disclosure to the relevant convicted POL

      defendants. During the Sift procedure I worked for long periods of time in the

      Derby Office to be close to the files and conduct the reviews. This involved

      working closely with Simon Clarke, Martin Smith and other junior employees

      of CK who would be responsible for record keeping. We also had members of

      the independent Bar to help with the reviewing process. Andrew Bolc would

      occasionally attend the Derby Office during this process.

17    During this time we thought that POL would be instructing an independent

      witness to replace Gareth Jenkins and POL were continuing to investigate

      cases which began to pile up awaiting prosecution. These were known as the

      "Stacked Cases."

18.   My direct contact with POL personnel was fairly limited. The point of contact
                                    Page 4 of 38
                                                                                       WITN10990100
                                                                                 WITN10990100




      between POL and CK was Martin Smith who was the constant presence in

      the Derby Office — Simon Clarke and I were often out at court on non POL

      criminal work. I had dealings on the telephone and by email with Jarnail Singh

      who I understood to be head of crime at POL. I only met him face to face 2 or

      3 times — once when Simon Clarke and I visited the POL offices in London at

      Old Street to discuss possible expert witnesses and the other occasions were

      when Jarnail Singh came to Derby. My visit to Old Street was the sole

      occasion that I met Rodric Williams but I was in contact with him occasionally

      by telephone or email.

19.   As a result of the "stacked cases" I was in touch with some of the POL

      investigators in those matters - the ones that stand out in my memory were

      Helen Dickenson and Chris Knight.

20.   I am asked for my view on how the working relationship between POL and CK

      functioned during my time at CK and if there were areas for improvement.

      Plainly the whole relationship between POL and CK was completely

      compromised by the lack of honesty and transparency by certain people at

      POL and Fujitsu who sat on the shortfalls of the Horizon system that they had

      known about for some time. I do not know who knew what and when and

      would be unable to identify those who sat on Horizon's shortfalls.The reality

      is that CK shut down prosecutions within days of the Second Sight Interim

      Report being published when it became apparent that we had a dishonest

      witness, Gareth Jenkins. Had these shortfalls been properly disclosed in a

      timely manner then the prosecutions would have been stopped much sooner.

21.   It is probably fair to say that the CK Post Office Department would have

      benefitted from proper oversight from the earliest stages from people with
                                  Page 5 of 38
                                                                                     WITN10990100
                                                                                    WITN10990100




      actual experience of prosecuting cases rather than different individuals in

      different offices doing their own thing.

22.   When it was appreciated by Simon Clarke that POL had a big problem with

      their expert (at that stage we did not realise that they had a big problem with

      Horizon itself) steps were immediately taken to prevent further prosecutions

      on tainted evidence, implement a review scheme and to revisit past

      convictions with a view to disclosure and to obtain an independent expert. The

      weekly hub meetings were established and the whole response was overseen

      in due course by Senior Treasury Counsel, Brian Altman QC (as he was then).



Knowledge of Horizon



23.   I am asked as to my understanding of the Horizon system during my time at

      CK whilst acting for POL. This is a difficult question to answer accurately as

      my knowledge has accrued over time and some elements I am not sure of

      now owing to the passage of time. I was slowly drawn into the Post Office

      work as described above and during the Sift process I reviewed dozens of

      cases both Legacy and Online. I have kept an interest in the issue since

      leaving CK and have read the Judgement of Holroyd LJ in Hamilton & others

      as well as watching some of the evidence in the current Inquiry. To say what

      I knew and when is quite difficult except for a couple of standout moments.

24.   One of the more seminal moments was the publication of the Second Sight

      Interim Report. This sticks out as we heard rumours immediately before

      publication that the report was going to say that they had found bugs in

      Horizon. Up until that stage we had been assured from all sides that the
                                   Page 6 of 38
                                                                                       WITN10990100
                                                                                 WITN10990100




      system was robust and that there was nothing that could undermine the

      integrity of the system. My information came from a number of sources both

      from within POL and what I had picked up from within CK. I cannot, at this

      point, remember specific conversations.

25    My understanding of the Horizon system was that it was an accounting system

      used by Post Office in a couple of forms since the turn of the century. I was

      told that it processed millions of transactions each day and was capable of

      balancing the cash and the stock. I was aware of the difference between

      Horizon Online and Legacy.

26.   We were assured that there was no "back door" into the system for Post Office

      or Fujitsu to alter the figures unbeknownst to the Sub Postmasters (SPMs).

      The fact that there was a "back door" only came to light when we got hold of

      the Deloitte report. Again I cannot remember who told us that there was no

      "back door" but I can remember the shock when the Deloitte report said that

      there was one.

27.   I only heard of bugs in the Horizon system after the publication of the Second

      Sight Interim Report in July 2013. I was not aware of the extent of the bugs

      until Hamilton and others which was heard long after I left CK.

28.   Whilst I was at CK we were assured that the system was robust. The Second

      Sight Interim Report whilst reporting that they had come across two bugs did

      not find anything "systemic" that would account for the losses allegedly

      sustained by the SPMs.

29.   I was told very little about the training offered to the SPMs.

30.   My understanding of the difference between Horizon Legacy and Horizon

      Online is relatively limited. The main difference between the two was that
                                    Page 7 of 38
                                                                                      WITN10990100
                                                                                 WITN10990100




      Horizon Online was a contemporaneous system whereas Horizon Legacy had

      to be downloaded when the system was not in use.

31.   I received no formal induction on the Horizon system from POL other than a

      training day on the system with a number of external counsel who prosecuted

      POL cases. I did not know these counsel and cannot remember their names.

      I am afraid I cannot remember where this course was held except that it was

      north of Nottingham. The course itself was not a great deal of use as it was

      effectively the sort of training a new cashier would get. The training did not

      cover reconciliation of balances. The instructor positively refused to answer

      questions on how the system could be defrauded.

32.   I am aware that my knowledge of the Horizon system has/had gaps in it. I

      currently do not understand how the POL accountants managed to acquire

      what must be hundreds of thousands of pounds in extra funds from SPMs

      repayments without noticing it.

33.   I was not aware of any bugs in the system until shortly before the Second

      Sight Interim Report when Martin Smith was told that the Second Sight Interim

      Report would disclose bugs in the system.

34.   I was not aware that the system was not robust until after my time at CK had

      ended.

35.   To a large extent the gaps in my knowledge are as a result of non-disclosure

      of the issues by POL.

36.   I am asked what steps, if any, did I take throughout my time working at

      Cartwright King to further your knowledge of the Horizon IT system, and any

      bugs, errors or defects within it. I was, of course, interested as to whether

      there might be any mileage in the claims that Horizon might be to blame for
                                  Page 8 of 38

                                                                            WITN10990100




generating false figures. I was interested at the time in any possible attack

that might be mounted on the system. The following matters suggested to me

at the time that the system was robust:

    i)      POL's assurances that they and Fujitsu found the system to be

            robust with no faults that could produce shortfalls.

     ii)    The scale of transactions being conducted — millions of

            transactions conducted daily in thousands of Post Offices

            apparently trouble free.

     iii)   The fact that very few of these problems were being reported in

            the Crown Post Offices.

    iv)     The full admissions to theft in a substantial minority of the cases

            that I sift reviewed.

    v)      The different types of alleged offending encountered. Some were

            alleged to be removing money to meet other expenses. Others

            were allegedly asking pensioners to reenter their PIN when

            making cash withdrawals, others were allegedly falsifying

            postage. There was no obvious "one bug fits all."

    vi)     We were told that there had never been any alleged surplus

            figure generated by the system. (The Second Sight Interim

            Report rebutted this!)

    vii)    The cavalier use of logins — for example post it notes with login

            details left on the terminal. Login details shared with other staff

            etc.

    viii)   False accounting by SPMs to cover shortfalls rather than using

            the correct reporting procedures.

                                                                                      WITN10990100




           ix)     Independent corroborating evidence from the alleged victims of

                   these offences or other members of staff reporting use of POL

                   money being used inappropriately.

           x)      The lack of any successful attack on the system in the cases,

                   even where experts were instructed.

           xi)     The Second Sight Interim Report which stated that they could not

                   find any systemic fault with the system.

37.   I appreciate that the above is all susceptible to confirmation bias but the reality

      is that we had no firm evidence that there were bugs in the system until the

      Second Sight Interim Report was published and very shortly after that we

      stopped the prosecutions.



POL Prosecutions and Horizon Issues



38.   I was aware from the beginning that the Horizon system was being challenged

      by the Sub Postmasters for Justice group. As I have said above the first

      confirmation that there were any bugs in the system came with the publication

      of the Second Sight Interim Review.

39.   I am asked to consider an advice that I wrote on 11th July 2012 in relation to

      the prosecution of Kim Wylie [POL00180894]. I am particularly asked if I recall

      the POL response to a previous advice in this case written in October 2010.

      have not been provided with that October 2010 advice and cannot recall its

      contents nor its reception from POL.

40    The "apocryphal evidence on the internet and elsewhere" would have come

      to my attention through discussions with colleagues and by reading the media
                                    Page 10 of 38
                                                                                       WITN10990100
                                                                                     WITN10990100




      both online and print. The Sub Postmasters for Justice group were making

      their case loudly at this time

41.   In July 2012 I had no reasons to doubt my instructions that the Horizon system

      was robust and had seen no evidence to the contrary.

42.   I was not involved in any contested trials for POL and, at this stage, I am not

      sure that I had even been in court instructed in an Horizon case as I have

      stated above. My involvement had been limited to early advices and settling

      of indictments when I was asked to by Andy Cash. This was very sporadic

      work.

43.   I do not think that CK were involved in the instructing        Second Sight or the


                                                                of
      work that they were instructed to do. I was told   of




                                                              their instruction by Andy

      Cash very shortly before the Wylie advice of July 2012 which was prompted

      by the Instruction of Second Sight. As Andy Cash was head of the Post Office

      Department at CK at that time I feel sure that he would have told me if he/CK

      had had any input into their investigation.

44.   I had little understanding of what the Second Sight Review would entail over

      and above what I put in my advice.

45.   I state my concerns about the Second Sight Independent Review in my advice

      of July 2012. These included whether cases would have to be adjourned

      pending the Review, the inevitable challenge to the integrity of the system in

      every contested case and, as I say in my advice, the argument being raised

      that, "there is no smoke without fire and we would not have needed to audit a

      bomb proof system."

46.   I am asked what alternative course of action I would have adopted. I make

      clear from my advice that I was unhappy with the way that Fujitsu would not

                                                                                     WITN10990100




      cooperate without charging enormous fees to do so. On the basis that the

      system was robust I would have required Fujitsu to demonstrate that the

      system was robust, that there were no mechanisms through which the

      shortfalls claimed by the SPMs could have been caused by the mechanics of

      the system. It was my view that it was in the interests of Fujitsu to nip this in

      the bud early and were I POL I would have demanded that this should happen

      but there was no appetite from POL so to do.

47.   When I stated, "until the 2nd Sight investigation is concluded we will be in a

      limbo" I meant that POL would be in a position where people would be able to

      refer to the as yet unfinished review. This could be used as a reason to delay

      cases until the Review had reported or should cases proceed before Second

      Sight had reported POL would be vulnerable to the "no smoke without fire

      arguments."

48.   I do not know what the response from POL was to my advice that this was a

      "firefighting position" except that I was told by Andy Cash that they did not like

      the advice. I was not asked to advise formally on the issue after that.

49.   I was aware that there was an attempt to collate the previous challenges to

      the Horizon system under Helen Rose. I don't think that I saw the product of

      this collation.

50.   I am asked to comment on an email exchange between Andy Cash and Jarnail

      Singh [POL00143377]. I was copied into this email chain but wrote none of

      the emails. I am asked, in particular, what I thought of Jarnail Singh's position

      as regards my advice. I was of the view that he was somewhat over optimistic

      as to the limited effect of commissioning the Second Sight Review

51.   I cannot recall any further consultation between me and POL — there was

      certainly no formal advice sought from me but there may have been email or

      telephone correspondence on the subject. I was aware that Helen Rose was

      collating material for the expert to be instructed. My feeling was that this

      advice was something of a damp squib and did not give it much thought until

      Second Sight produced their Interim Report the following year.



Helen Rose Report and Gareth Jenkins Expert Report



52.   I am asked to provide my reflections on an Email exchange between Mr

      Jarnail Singh and me regarding 'Horizon Integrity Project, dated 6 August

      2012 [POL00141416]. This appears to be a response to my advice of 11th

      July 2012 [POL00180894]. Helen Rose had been detailed to gather the

      information requested in that advice so that we could have all of the attacks

      made in court on the Horizon system in one place for an expert to deal within

      a subsequent report.

53.   I cannot recall the "chat" between me and Jarnail Singh mentioned in the

      email.

54.   I am asked about an email exchange between Mr Jarnail Singh and me

      regarding Horizon and the Kim Elizabeth Wylie case, dated 12 September

      2012 [POL00020489]. I am not sure that I saw the completed Helen Rose

      report on this matter. At this stage POL work was something that I dipped in

      and out of whilst conducting my defence work out of Nottingham. I would

      respond to emails and give advice when asked but I did not have a general

      oversight in 2012.

55.   In the email exchange [POL00020489] I express my preference for an

      independent Expert Witness. The potential for allegations of bias or actual

      conflicts of interest, as in the event were plainly relevant, were obvious. The

      problem was that Gareth Jenkins had been fielded as an expert before and

      had not been attacked in that manner and the point had not been taken by

      previous prosecution counsel, defence counsel or Judges involved.

56.   I was made firmly aware that finding an expert in the limited time available

      who could realistically match the experience of Gareth Jenkins with the

      system and in the teeth of resistance by Fujitsu over opening up their systems

      because of concerns about commercial sensitivity was impracticable.

57.   I cannot recall having any further input into the expert report but may well have

      done. As I have said above I did not conduct any of the trials in Horizon cases

      and was not involved in their day to day litigation.

58.   I am asked to consider my email to Martin Smith regarding the Gareth Jenkins

      report [P0L00096997], dated 12 October 2012 and to explain what my views

      were on the report. Specifically, with hindsight, did I think that the report was

      sufficient and transparent. I cannot recall the report but at the time I seemed

      to be happy with it. The idea was to have a report that would go to the

      robustness of Horizon and deal with the attacks that had been made thus far

      and why they were not valid and would provide the basis for dealing with any

      fresh attack on the system. At this stage our instructions were that the system

      was robust in its entirety and it is difficult to see what, with the knowledge we

      had then, we could have done. The defence should have been put on notice

      of what previous attacks had been made and why they were not valid and we

      provided an expert for defence experts to have a crack at if they could.

The Second Sight Interim Report, July 2013



59.   I am asked if I was aware of any discussions between OK and POL in relation

      to preparing a public response to the Second Sight interim report? I was not

      aware of any such discussions and cannot say if any such discussions

      occurred.

60.   As far as CK's concerns with the Second Sight Interim Report were concerned

      we were very much alive to the fact that a system that we had been told was

      robust did indeed have bugs in it. This was plainly going to cause POL

      difficulties.

61.   I remember being taken aback when we discovered what the Second Sight

      Interim Report would contain as it flew in the teeth of what we had been told.

      Again it was not of direct concern to me as I was not a member of the Post

      Office Department.

62.   I did become involved when I was approached by Simon Clarke who told me

      about the conversation that he and Martin Smith had had with Gareth Jenkins

      in late June over a case that Simon was prosecuting.

63.   The thrust of the conversation was that it was Gareth Jenkins who had

      provided the information about the two bugs mentioned in the Second Sight

      Interim Report. This was clearly not consistent with statements that he had

      given in the criminal cases that he had been involved with.

64.   The implications of this were plainly enormous and it was our joint view that

      POL could not continue to prosecute on his evidence and there would have to


                                  Page 15 of 38
                                                                                         WITN10990100
                                                                                       WITN10990100




      be a revisiting of previous cases with disclosure in mind. This was unlikely to

      be popular with POL and our employers, CK.

65.   The Management at CK turned out to be supportive of our position - the matter

      was canvassed at the highest levels with the equity partners as POL was an

      enormous client even for a firm of the size of CK. Simon wrote what was later

      called "The Clarke Advice" on the 15t1 July 2013, which effectively stopped

      the prosecution of POL cases by CK some 7 days after the formal publication

      of the Second Sight Interim Report until an independent expert was engaged

      which never happened.

66.   POL were philosophical in regard to disclosure of the Second Sight Interim

      Report to current and previous defendants. The attitude then was still that the

      system was essentially robust and, once the new expert was instructed, they

      could prosecute again. They were very concerned at the new cases being

      investigated piling up.


The CK Case Reviews (Review Protocol [POL00129452])


67.   The CK case reviews were designed to bring the attention of convicted

      defendants to matters that should have been disclosed to them during their

      prosecutions. This was initially limited to the Horizon Online cases. I was not

      involved in settling the protocol but I have little doubt that had I asked for any

      changes they would be implemented.

68.   In broad terms the process operated by the relevant files being subjected to a

      first Sift. This was carried out by various solicitors at Cartwright King (including

      Martin Smith and Andrew Bolc) and those cases that passed the first sift

      criteria were subjected to a second sift which was conducted by counsel.

                                                                                 WITN10990100




      Initially the only counsel involved were Simon Clarke and myself but later

      counsel from the independent bar were instructed. The operation was

      conducted from the CK Derby offices to give easy access to the files. If

      disclosure was required we were advising POL to disclose the Second Sight

      Interim Report and the Helen Rose Report.

69.   I have been asked to consider a number of case reviews and reflect upon the

      same and I do so. The point of the reviews was to set out the reasoning

      process for disclosure I am not sure that second guessing my decisions then

      has much purpose bearing in mind that the whole process was fundamentally

      undermined by POL's lack of disclosure of all of the bugs then known about

      and the presence of a "back door into the system all of which we had no

      inkling of at that stage and would, I am sure, have made a difference to the

      review process.

70    Jamie Dixon [POL00297631] I advised disclosure of the relevant material in

      this matter

71.   Tahir Mahmood Sethi [POL00168922] this matter involved full admissions

      to the auditors and in interview to effectively the amount missing. The

      defendant pleaded guilty in the Magistrates' Court. No disclosure was made

      on review. In my view with the knowledge I had then this advice is

      unexceptionable.


72.   Nicholas Mackrill and Amanda Mackrill [POL00021272], In this matter

      Nicholas Mackrill admitted and pleaded guilty on a limited basis to theft and

      Amanda Mackrill stood her trial on the theft count and was acquitted. She was

      sentenced to false accounting which she had admitted.

73_   Nicholas Clark [POL00294610] The defendant admitted taking POL funds in

      interview and in a note to the auditor. He pleaded guilty to false accounting.

      advised that no disclosure should be made and in my view on what I then

      knew this advice was unexceptionable.

74.   Vijay Parekh [POL00294429] this matter involved full admissions to taking

      money for his own purposes to the auditors, in interview and the author of the

      pre-sentence report. No disclosure was made on review. In my view with the

      knowledge I had then this advice is unexceptionable.

75.   Gillian Howard [POL00021207] in this matter the defendant admitted false

      accounting to cover losses that accrued in her Post Office. Her solicitors

      offered a plea to fraud on the basis that she covered the losses and had made

      no financial gain. There was evidence that a son of one of their employees

      had been committing thefts from the secure area which was not disclosed. I

      was concerned about this case at the time and having reread the advice I think

      that I should have advised disclosure not of the Second Sight Report but of

      the subsequent thefts - despite the admissions to false accounting and the

      basis of plea of no financial or material gain being honoured by the Judge and

      the Crown.

76.   William Giles [POL00294501] This Horizon Legacy case involved a

      purported loss of over £186,000. The defendant admitted stealing money from

      the Post Office but disputed quantum. The indictment was amended to a lower

      figure of £164,152.95 and the defendant pleaded. No disclosure was made

      on review. With what I knew then I think this decision, was not unreasonable.

77.   Deborah D'Arcy [POL00091783] In this matter I advised disclosure of the

      Second Sight Interim Report and the Helen Rose Report.

78    Jahira Begum [POL00021270] In this case I advised disclosure of the

      relevant materials. I have been asked to comment on [POL00021285] which

      is an email from me to Martin Smith telling him that we should disclose the

      Second Sight Interim Report.

79.   Kathleen Crane [POL00198128] Horizon Legacy case Defendant pleaded

      guilty to Fraud and no disclosure advised. Again this case is on the line with

      the protocol. She pleaded guilty at an early stage and with what I knew then

      my advice was reasonable.

80.   Robert Clay [POL00294422] The defendant pleaded guilty before primary

      disclosure would have been made and was not dealt with on the basis of his

      admissions. With what I knew then my advice was reasonable.

81.   Daljit Singh Benning [POL00294514] I advised disclosure of the relevant

      material.

82.   Alison Henderson [POL00061747] I advised disclosure of the relevant

      material.

83.   Peter Huxham [POL00294518] I advised disclosure of the relevant material.

84.   Ravinder Manku [POL00040024] This is an early advice on an unconvicted

      defendant rather than a disclosure advice on a convicted defendant.

85.   Anthony King [POL00168935] This was not really an Horizon case. The

      defendant was generating rejected labels and using them as paid postage. He

      pleaded at an early stage. On what I knew then I see nothing exceptionable

      about this advice.

86.   Siobahn Sayer [POL00294524] I advised disclosure of the relevant material

      in this matter.

87    Angela Hodgson [POL00294516] I advised disclosure of the relevant

      material in this matter.

88.   Alison Henderson [POL00294503] I advised disclosure of the relevant

      material in this matter.

89.   Pauline Greenhalgh [POL00294502] In this case I did not advise disclosure.

      With hindsight, even with what I knew then, I think that I should have advised

      disclosure to comply with the protocol.

90.   Mahesh Patel and Prakesh Patel [POL00142328] This is an early advice on

      unconvicted defendants rather than a disclosure advice on a convicted

      defendant.

91    Mohammed Luqman [POL00168939] This was case where there were

      admissions to theft and a guilty plea at the first opportunity so disclosure would

      not have arisen. On what I knew then I see nothing exceptionable about this

      advice.

92.   Neelam Shanez [POL00198136] I advised disclosure of the relevant material

      in this matter.

93.   Linda Wrigley [POL00294425] This was a case where there were

      admissions to theft and a guilty plea at the earliest stage. The defendant

      expressed surprise at the total sum alleged. I advised no disclosure. On what

      I knew then I think that my advice was reasonable.

94.   Katherine McQue [POL00294520] I advised disclosure of the relevant

      material in this matter.

95.   Sunil Patel [POL00294498] In this case the defendant pleaded guilty at the

      first opportunity and admitted taking POL funds in interview. On what I knew

96.    Sennapathy Ponnampalam Narenthiran [POL00294522]                    I advised

       disclosure of the relevant material in this matter.

97.    Ali Hashmi [POL00168926] This was a guilty plea at the first opportunity in

       the Magistrates' Court. There were full admissions to theft and false

       accounting. On what I knew then I see nothing exceptionable about this

       advice.

98.    Gregory Harding [POL00142279] This case pleaded on the first appearance

       in the Crown Court on the basis that the defendant had not taken the money

       which had been lost "in the normal course of business." I advised no

       disclosure. On what I knew then I think that my advice was reasonable.

99.    Rabina Shaheen [POL00294526] I advised disclosure of the relevant

       material in this matter.

100.   Timothy Brentnall [POL00294428] In this case I did not advise disclosure.

       With hindsight, even with what I knew then, I think that I should have advised

       disclosure to comply with the protocol. I rather think that I was influenced by

       the Judge sentencing on the basis of no loss and the defendant's admissions

       in interview.

101    Jacqueline McDonald [POL00006579] I advised disclosure of the relevant

       material in this matter.

102.   Valery James [POL00294499] In this matter there were admissions to taking

       over £90,000 from the Post Office and there was no real dispute as to the

       for the review process. I would have been involved in the decision-making

       process. Brian Altman KC in his review of 15th October 2013 [POL00006581]

       at paragraph 64 suggests that it was because all of the Post Offices were

       balanced on the rollout of Horizon Online which would make sense.

105.   I am asked to comment on [POL00147344] where it is stated that "CK

       deliberately set a very low threshold" for deciding whether to disclose the

       Helen Rose report or Second Sight report to the Defence. The document

       referred to is an email from Jarnail Singh who appears to be referring to the

       CK Sift protocol [POL00129452] where the phrase is used. The idea was that

       the initial sifters would pass the case on for a second sift using a very low

       threshold and the second sifters would disclose the information where it might

       have been disclosable had it been available at the time.

106.   I am asked "In [POL00147344], it states that a new prosecution policy was

       almost ready to be put into place. Please explain any role that CK played in

       drafting this new prosecution policy." I am not sure to which prosecution policy

       this refers. I know that Simon Clarke was settling a prosecution policy but

       understood that there may have been other policies also being circulated.

       had little to do with this side of things.

107    I am asked with the benefit of hindsight, how, if at all, should the review have

       been conducted differently? Plainly the review was conducted on the false

       premise that the only material that needed to be disclosed was the Second

                                                                                  WITN10990100




       Sight Interim Report and the Helen Rose Report when it must have been

       known at POL and Fujitsu that the problems with Horizon ran much deeper.

       We were under the impression that whilst there were a couple of minor bugs

       revealed by second sight and we had a problem with a dishonest witness the

       Horizon system was fundamentally sound and once that had been

       demonstrated by an independent expert witness that prosecutions would

       proceed again. If we knew then what we know now then there should have

       been a root and branch reappraisal of the past prosecutions and a complete

       moratorium on prosecutions based on Horizon until it could be demonstrated

       to be sound.

108.   I am asked, "Were you (or others CK) involved in discussions about

       termination of ongoing prosecutions following the Second Sight interim report

       and/or the CK case review? If so, please explain." At the time we had

       suspended prosecutions until we had a new expert. The expectation was that

       such an expert would be found and prosecutions could continue. Plainly some

       cases were already in the system and decisions had to be taken as to whether

       these could be adjourned or whether the prosecutions should be discontinued.

       In the meantime POL was investigating new cases which were building up in

       quantity. These were referred to as the "stacked cases." As POL dragged its

       feet on instructing a new expert these too became too stale to prosecute and

       so we advised their discontinuance. I was involved in these discussions.



Mediation Scheme



109    I was not involved in the mediation scheme except on the outer edges.

110.   I am asked to comment on [POL00145821]. This is an email from Andy

       Parsons of Bond Dickenson to Martin Smith, copied into Rodric Williams and

       Jarnail Singh. It required and urgent response and Martin asked me to

       respond which I did in red below each point in Andy Parsons' email. CK had

       little input into setting up the mediation process but were asked to advise

       where the process might affect defendants with POL convictions.

111.   I am asked to comment on a number of documents entitled "Response To

       Initial Complaint Review & Mediation Scheme Post Office Preliminary

       Investigation Report." These are reviews of documents prepared by, I think,

       Bond Dickenson for the mediation scheme which they asked CK to respond

       to. It is very difficult to comment on documents taken by themselves and

       without sight of or reference to the documents to which they refer. It was my

       strong view that SPMs who had been convicted or who were in the stacked

       cases should not have been included in the mediation scheme. My view was

       that their proper remedy was by way of appeal to the Court of Appeal.

112.   The mediation scheme was run through Bond Dickenson and the email

       correspondence shows that their grasp of criminal procedure was sketchy at

       best.

       of stacked cases when it appears that cases that were still potentially to be

116.   [POL00061199] Hughie Thomas This case was prepared on limited papers

       — there was no defendant interview available and no way to tell how strong

       the prosecution case was — it was already 9 years old in 2014 when this

       document was prepared. It was my view that the proposed summary and

       concessions proposed should not have been made on such limited

       documentation.

117    [POL00108373] Terence Walters I make no suggestions to alter the

       proposed text.

       telephone numbers. I see nothing exceptionable in this concern.

119.   [POL00142454] This is an email asking either Simon Clarke or myself how to

       respond to an email from Messrs Howe + Co solicitors about the Helen Rose

       Report. I do not know whether Simon or I responded to this email or what that

123.   [POL00206241] Wendy Buffrey This was a briefing note on this applicant's

       mediation application. On what I knew then this note was unexceptionable.

124.   [POL00206240] This is Jarnail Singh's email in response to the above briefing

       note.

125.   [POL00077936] This is not my document but refers to the case of Haji

       Choudry which I had reviewed.

126.   I am asked how the Mediation Scheme actually operated and I am not in a

       position to answer this. Our involvement was limited to settling some case

       summaries or editing others and limited advice as to disclosure. They were

       not using the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA) rules so

       we were limited to advising on the consequences of disclosure rather than

       disclosure itself.

127    I had very little direct contact with Bond Dickinson. I don't think that I ever met

       any of their lawyers. Requests seemed to come via Rodric Williams but I was

       occasionally emailed by Andrew Parsons and others, usually when there was

       a deadline and Martin Smith was not available. During this period I was not

       working exclusively on POL work and had my criminal case load based in

       Nottingham as my mainstay work.

128.   I am asked to comment on [POL00209747] which is my advice on "Criminal

       Applicants to the Mediation Scheme Convicted of False Accounting." I cannot

       recall who asked me to settle this advice.

129.   I am asked for my views on the efficacy of the mediation scheme for applicants

       with criminal convictions. I was not privy to the results of any such mediations

       but my attitude at the time was that it was entirely unsuitable for those with

       criminal convictions and those still under investigation for criminal offences.

       was full of misgivings about the complete lack of criminal experience in Bond

       Dickinson and the complete lack of understanding of disclosure in criminal

       cases including basic GDPR.

130.   In [POL00046590] (an email to Martin Smith) I refer to the opinion of a POL

       investigator that an alleged robbery was an "inside job." "The current version

       refers to the officer's suspicions that the robbery was not genuine but this was

       not part of the prosecution case nor was it aired with the defence at the time.

       I do not think that it is safe to allow such conjecture in the Mediation Response

       and have edited accordingly." This allegation had never formed part of the

       prosecution case and I had seen no evidence to support such an allegation

       against the SPM. I did not see how an unfounded suspicion against the SPM

       could be relevant to any issue in the mediation.

131.   I had no contact with the JFSA or Second Sight and had no views on their

       approaches. I was certainly interested in their product when it was produced.

132.   I am asked what my view was of POL's position during the mediation scheme

       that the Horizon IT system was robust. This view did not surprise me as my

       instructions were that it was robust. At the time POL were looking for an expert

       in order to restart prosecutions based on the system.

133.   We were not kept in the loop as to the progress of the mediation scheme so

       would have been in no position to have an opinion on the speed of progress

       of the mediation scheme.

134.   I had no insight into the abilities or resources of Second Sight to form any

       belief as to their ability to carry out the work in the mediation scheme.

135.   I was not in a position to assess the adequacy of POL's disclosure to Second

       Sight or the SPMs. We only had sight of a limited number of documents and
                                    Page 27 of 38
                                                                                      WITN10990100
                                                                                    WITN10990100




       those related to Criminal applicants only. We certainly did not see the totality

       of disclosure to a single applicant let alone all of them.

136.   I do not have sufficient information to have any views on the access to

       adequate representation of the SPMs at the Mediation Scheme.

137.   I do not know if the Mediation Scheme operated in such a way as to fulfil its

       intended purposes as I had very little part in the process.

138.   I am unable to comment on the adequacy of the Mediation Scheme as a

       process to facilitate settlement discussions between SPMs and POL. I never

       heard of any positively resolved mediations and certainly played no role in

       them.

139.   I am asked to set out what I consider the successes and failures of the

       Working Group and the Mediation Scheme to be. I was not involved in any of

       this and am unable to comment on any successes and failures.

140.   I am asked if I am of the view that SPMs faced any challenges in seeking to

       obtain redress from POL. To an extent I did not have a proper oversight of the

       SPM's position as I was only involved in the criminal cases. Plainly the main

       difficulty that the SPMs faced in getting redress was the failure of POL to face

       up to what was happening and concealing the evidence that it was.

141    I am asked to consider Brian Altman KC's "Interim Review of Cartwright King's

       Current Processes." [POL00006583] dated 2 August 2013 and my response

       [POL00066807] dated 13th August 2013.

142.   I had no issues with Brian Altman's Interim Review but it has to be

       remembered how fast things were moving in July and August 2013. Simon

       Clarke spoke to Dr Jenkins on 28th June 2013, The Second Sight Interim

       Review was published on 8th July 2013 and Simon Clarke wrote the "Clarke

       Advice" on the 15th July 2013. Brian Altman wrote his Interim Review on the

       2nd August 2013 by which time the Review Process had been set up and the

       first advices on disclosure had been written. The weekly POL Horizon call had

       also been set up.

143.   The purpose of my response, dated 13th August 2013 was not to criticise but

       to update, address all of the concerns raised and deal with new ones that had

       arisen with all of the new processes.

144.   I am asked to address the meeting on 9th September 2013 between Brian

       Altman KC, various POL employees, various CK employees and various

       Womble Bond Dickinson employees [POL00006769].

145.   I am asked what I made of Brian Altman's advice that "Fujitsu should be kept

       at "arms length as a third party." I cannot recall what I thought about this at

       the time.

146.   I am asked how POL responded to Brian Altman's recommendations in his

       interim review. I cannot say how they reacted. The main liaison between POL

       and CK was Martin Smith so any information would have been trickled down

       through him.

                                                                                     WITN10990100




147.   The view at the meeting was that the bugs were of very limited effect and that

       the system would be given a clean bill of health by an independent expert.

       The systems to be put in place were to ensure that any further bugs would be

       known about and properly acted upon.

148.   I am asked to consider Brian Altman KC's "General Review of Post Office

       Prosecutions" dated 15th October 2013 [POL00006581]. I do not remember

       seeing this document at the time and cannot say what reaction I had at the

       time if any.

149.   I am asked what my view is of Brian Altman KC's analysis of POL's strategy

       and process of review and the nature and scope of CK's review. My view is

       that he was correct. On what we knew at the time what we were doing was

       reasonable. We identified the problem that we thought that we had i.e. Gareth

       Jenkins and his non-disclosure of the bugs revealed by The Second Sight

       Interim Review. We suspended prosecutions, we set up the Wednesday Hub

       and began a review of cases to inform the defence where we thought that

       disclosure should have been made. That review was twice stated by Brian

       Altman QC to be "fundamentally sound" both in his Interim Review (paragraph

       15) and General Review (paragraph 170).

150.   I do not know why Brian Altman KC was only provided with two case files at

       this stage. Had he wanted more he could have asked for them and would have

       been provided with them. I do not see how the provision of further original files

       may have affected his conclusion on the identification of flaws in the review

       process. He was given the final advices where the reasoning was set out. He

       states that he might not have come to the same conclusions as reviewing

       Counsel on some of them (paragraph 172). Unless it is suggested that he

                                                                                     WITN10990100




        should have rereviewed each of the cases ab initio then, in my view, his

        approach was reasonable.

151.    I have been asked to consider the final version of Brian Altman KC's report

       "Review of Post Office Ltd Prosecution Role", dated 19 December 2013

       [POL00112937]. I do not know what input CK had into this report. I had no

       input into it myself. I was not in direct contact with Brian Altman KC either by

       email or telephone and even with my response to his interim report I asked

       that he might be shown it rather than sending it directly to him. As far as I can

       recall I have only met Brian Altman at the meeting of 9th September 2013 in

       his chambers.

152.   Again I am not sure that I have seen this report before. I note that Brian Altman

       KC does not criticise the CK Review process having read 31 of our reviews.

153.   I am asked for my general view on the content of this report and I think that

       had Brian Altman KC known then what has come to light since he wrote the

       report his views would have been rather different. This highlights the problems

       with an Inquiry such as this one in that it is almost impossible to judge the

       actions and opinions of those who did not know then what came to light later.

154.   I am asked whether there is anything further relevant to the inquiry's terms of

       reference of which I think the Chair should be aware? It is my view that were

       it not for Simon Clarke's telephone call to Gareth Jenkins and the action that

       he and CK took on that as a result the prosecutions would have continued for

       many months afterwards as there was an enormous appetite in POL for them

       to recommence.

155.   The reality is that there may be grounds to criticize the way that CK conducted

       the POL prosecutions however they did fulfil their role as external lawyers in
                                   Page 31 of 38

                                                                                  WITN10990100




         calling a halt to the prosecutions and immediately implementing steps to

         address the faults in the Post Office prosecutions as they perceived them at

         the time.




Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
