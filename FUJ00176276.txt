SUBMISSION TO POST OFFICE DATE: 2"% March 2022

SUMMARY OF WORK:

The audit system stores data, depending on its type, for a default period of 7 years or 18
months. Post Office previously asked Fujitsu Services to retain audit data beyond the default
periods until 30th April 2022. The original purge date was 12th October 2014.

Post Office now require Fujitsu Services to further extend the data retention periods until
30th April 2023. Audit systems can be configured to delay restart of purging until after this
revised date, however Fujitsu Services shall only retain the data whilst the data resides on
the Audit Support Facility in the Data Centres. Fujitsu Services shall not be obliged to retain
the data once; that data resides on the replacement to the Audit Support Facility provided by
the Next Supplier, or; the Data Centre Operations Service has expired or been terminated;
whichever the sooner.

The Eternus storage deletion prevention date is not being changed. This means that any
audit data older than 7 years or 18 months is not protected by the Eternus deletion
prevention.

CHANGE WORK ORDER DELIVERABLES:
Fujitsu Services will:

© Configure the audit system to delay the restart of purging until 30" April 2023.

IMPLEMENTATION TIMEFRAME:

Exact dates for progression of this change to be agreed between Post Office and Fujitsu
Services upon approval of this CWO and supply of a valid Purchase Order.

Changes and/or re-prioritisations of entries in this schedule may be required as a result of
potential impacts/conflicts relating to resource and infrastructure caused by this CWO.

Facility provided by the Next Supplier, or; the Data Centre Operation Services has expired or

Other:

There is a risk that this requested extension fails in development because of some
unforeseen system limit, and so it will be necessary to modify the audit purger to overcome
the system limit. Any modification to the audit purger will be subject to a subsequent CWO.

The Eternus disks are, as previously advised to Post Office, end of service life, and so become
increasingly likely to fail as time goes on.
