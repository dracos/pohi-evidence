I spoke to Mark Westbrook about Gareth not attending. His view is that is ok but not the best option.

I think we should respond to FJ along the lines below:

Pete

Thanks for letting me know about Gareth. This meeting is very important for us and our Counsel, so please can you
be sure that Torstein will be able to address the questions. We're very tight on time before the Defence is due so we
are unlikely to have another opportunity to meet with Counsel again. It would be very frustrating to hold the meeting
and not be able to get clear answers on the day.

Regards
Rodric

I have not asked Gareth to attend at this stage as I think Torstein and I can answer most questions on Horizon
unless we get into the deep detail where we can call Gareth in if required.

Hope this is Ok.

Chris, Mike,

Thank you for agreeing to meet with our external legal team to help us prepare our defence to the allegations made in
the Post Office Group Litigation.

I set out below the details for that meeting. Please note our legal team has also asked Mark Westbrook from Deloitte

to attend to join up the work he has been doing for us over the past couple of years in response to the Claimants’
allegations. I understand Mark is well known to Pete and Torstein through that work!
