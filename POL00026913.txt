I need an urgent review and mini <taskforce> on this one. It probably needs to link up heavily with
Angelas work as FSC are mentioned extensively - Angela cfi. I don’t know how we respond to this but

can we section a few inside people to get all over it and give me/ Al/ Paula evidence and understanding.

Dear both,
This needs looking into please.

https://problemswithpol.wordpress.com/201 5/1 1/10/the-error-in-
horizon/?iframe=true&theme_preview=true

Can I have a report that takes the points in order and explains them.

Tim McCormack is campaigning against PO and Horizon. I had another note from him this am which
Tom will forward, so you are both in the loop.

We must take him seriously and professionally

This particular blog is independent of Sparrow but clearly related in that it appears to present similar
challenges that were raised in the course of the scheme.

I'm most concerned that we/ our suppliers appear to be very lax at handling £24k. And want to know
we've rectified all the issues raised, if they happened as Tim explains.

Thanks.

Paula
