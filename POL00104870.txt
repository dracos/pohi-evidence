Interviewing Suspects in Prison
1. Establishing the Location of a Prisoner

1.1 England & Wales. In order to establish or confirm the location of a
prisoner enquiries should be made by speaking with HM Prison Service
Inmate Location on , they will ascertain in which
establishment the inmate is imprisoned.

1.2 Scotland. Investigators should make contact with National
Intellig the Scottish Prison Service on {”
or email

1.3 Northern Ireland Investigators should contact the Prison
Intelligence Office, Northern Ireland which is in
the Police Service of Northern Ireland on }

2. Obtaining the Permission of the Governor

2.1 In England and Wales obtaining the permission of the Prison Governor
can be facilitated by the Prison Intelligence Officer. (Each prison
has a Police Officer attached to them as a Prison Intelligence
Officer). Contact should be made with them as they will guide
Investigators through the requirements of the particular prison
establishment. In Scotland the National Intelligence Bureau and in
Northern Ireland the Prison Intelligence Office will assist
investigators in obtaining the permission of the Governor.

2.2. Investigators should note that some prison establishments do have
tape recording facilities which are appropriate for interviews under
caution. Nevertheless Investigators should establish exactly what is
available at the prison as some of the recording equipment may fall
short of what is required for a suspect interview. (Namely the
facility to record dual tapes and put a time stamp on them). If
appropriate equipment is not available then Investigators will have
to gain permission of the Governor to take recording equipment into
the prison establishment.

2.3. All three jurisdictions will require a written request detailing
brief circumstances of the reason for interview and the fact that it
will be conducted under caution. Form GS092 Prison Interview Letter
should be used as guide for the written communication.

ing in Prison Hints & Tips

3.1 When interviewing in prison the inmate is entitled the same rights as
if they were not in prison, including the right to have a solicitor
present and if it applies an appropriate adult and interpreter. As
such prior to the interview and to prevent a wasted visit it is worth
ascertaining if the inmate wishes to have a solicitor present and if
so make arrangements for them to attend. Investigators should also

establish if an appropriate adult or an interpreter will be required
and again make necessary arrangements.

Intervi

3.2 If the inmate refuses to be interviewed then the Criminal Law Team
should be consulted on the necessity to conduct the interview,
bearing in mind that the inmate will probably refuse to answer
questions. Investigators should note that the police can require an
inmate to remain at an interview, as if they were under arrest at a
police station, if they are being interviewed about an offence which
may result in charges. As such a suspect can be compelled to remain
at an interview with RMG Investigators if a Police Officer is
present. Of course the inmate can always refuse to answer all
questions.

Should the Prison Governor refuse to allow an interview in the prison
and it is thought necessary to conduct one then liaison should be
established with the police. The police can arrange for the inmate
to be produced from prison custody into custody at a police station.

If the prisoner admits a criminal offence and Royal Mail Group Ltd or
other body later decides not to institute criminal proceedings the
Prison Governor must be informed without delay by letter. It should
embody a request that the prisoner be informed of the decision.
