Dear All
On Tuesday the Board asked for information on three things this week:
e A paper on Transitional Support Services with Fujitsu which we agreed would be considered by corresponded

e The impact of the Financial Services Junction insurance changes, and the continued Transitional Support from
Fujitsu, on the strategic plan and bottom line (including the P&L and cashflow changes)

e@ The impact on Horizon/Second Sight on our insurance cover.

The first two points are covered by the attached and the final one is explained by Chris below

Insurance

We discussed what impact the current Horizon issues might have on our insurance on which we are advised by our
insurance broker, Miller. Their view is that whilst other insurance policies may be impacted the most likely one is D&O —
this has the added complication as it is the only policy we share with RM and was placed by their broker, JLT. The excess
on this policy varies under different criteria but the main one is £25k on each and every claim. A meeting is being set up
with JLT and Miller to ensure they are fully briefed on the issues before JLT engage with the insurer.
