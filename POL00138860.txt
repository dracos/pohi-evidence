Thanks Alwen.

I appreciate this is the product of a lot of hard work and careful thought. There is no risk free solution and the way we
have to manage it today is unattractive. I support the proposal because it allows us to get a bit on the front foot and
demonstrate our very positive intent to be fair to all concerned. It also allows us to make a step towards an end game.
Of course, that could trigger a reaction, in parliament, the media or the courts but if it does, it is probably only hastening
the inevitable.
