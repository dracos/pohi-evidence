Itt does look as if there was a problem with last weeks balance - cutoffs and
some final OBCS transactions were done on counter 3, then balancing continued
lon counter 4, but this did not seem to know about what had been done on
counter 3 (there were many underlying Riposte timeout messages). The

transactions were entered again; I need to ascertain whether they were sent
to TIP twice and whether the PM is out of pocket.

lave spoken to PM who confirms there were problems and is worried that they
y continue this week. I'll contact her tomorrow a.m. to see how they have
lot_on.

lr) Response :

eM balanced ok. She has reversed the transactions which she had had to
reenter (the original ones were included in the new CAP). This was all caused
by counter 4 being unable to see messages recently written on counter 3 when
the stock unit was being balanced.

lfhere is no accounting discrepancy here, but there is @ problem in that the
JPM was allowed to balance with no warning that the counters weren't
communicating. MSU informed that I'm sending this to devt for further
investigation.

summary of problem: 22/1/2003: PM was balancing. She reported that counters 3 and 4 were both very slow on 22 and 23rd Jan.
counter 4 event log shows many "An unexpected error occurred while attempting to insert a message. Timeout occurred waiting for
Hock. (0xC1090003)." It looks as if messages written on counter 3 were failing to be replicated to the counter 4 messagestore.
kop marks written on counter 1 at 18:00 are 1:604508 (18:00), 2:1227066 (18:00), 3:1072850 (18:00), 4:471001 (18:00) Rollover
narks for su AA written on counter 4 at 18:55 are 1:604654 (16:44), 2:1227075 (18:44), 3:1072553 (16:46), 4:471195 (18:49) Hence
counter 1 can see all the other counters, but counter 4 hasn't got messages from counter 3. This caused various problems: Balance
snapshot on counter 4 was missing some transactions - PM reentered them, then found (next day) they were in twice. PM confused
land unhappy. No warning given that counter was effectively disconnected - she was allowed to balance. Event storm on Tivoli.
counter daily CAC figures inconsistent with SU rollover. Eight other sites have had similar event storms in the last month, so
this isn't a one-off. Always during balancing (sometimes immediately after Declare Stamps, but not consistently). Cleardesk seems
to stop the events, though in this case the counters were still running slowly. This has been investigated before, but no cause
