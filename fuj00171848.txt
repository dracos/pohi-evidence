    Fast ARQ interface does not provide the user with any indication of duplicate records/messages.

 is omission means that we are unaware of the presence of duplicate transactions. In the event that duplicates are retrieved and
 turned to POL without our knowledge the integrity of the data provided comes into question. The customer and indeed the defense
 d the court would assume that the duplicates were bone fide transactions and this would be incorrect. There are a number of
 gh profile court cases in the pipeline and it is imperative that we provide sound, accurate records.

Andy and I have looked at this. We think the method most compatible with existing behaviour is

Check for duplicates for HNGx in a similar method to how duplicates are checked for in Horizon. For Horizon they are le:Iitimat.ely
logged in the audit log and then ignored (because it is just that identical messages are stored by mistake in more than one
transaction filo). For HNGx, in the Fast ARQ case, their detection will cause them to be logged in the QueryLog and a count kept
of how many there are; they will not be ignored.

If this    count is greater   than 0 then bError will be set and the block of code 4~                  ~    h~~~~               ~       ~               1~~

I have built a prototype QueryDLL.dll which solves this problem. Now if duplicate HNGx messages are detected the Fast ARQ fails
at the client with the message "Filtering Failed" displayed at the bottom of its form and on the server in the QueryLog there are
detailed messages describing the duplicates found.

I attach a zip of the source (with the changes done marked up by this PEAK number) plus details of the test run in a test plan in
evidence attached and labelled "Prototype Fix".

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT OF FIX:

SPECIFY THE HNG-X PLATFORMS IMPACTED:

The platform: is set and is the "Audit Serv.,i".

TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

HNGx can rarely produce transactions with duplicate Journal Sequence Numbers. At the moment, when running a FAG ARQ on the audi t
server, these duplicates are not noticed. This means that the evidence presented by the Prosecution Team may show duplicate
transactions without it being noticed; the Defence Team may spot this and call into the question the integrity of our data.

LIST OF KNOWN DIMENSIONS DESIGN PARTS AFFECTED BY THE CHANGE:

 UDIT EXTRACT SVR

  E ANY OF THESE DESIGN PARTS AFFECTED BY APPROVED CPs/PEAKS in HNGX Release                .

Yes they are, but HNGX Release 2 has been live for quite a wh.i I'::.

RELEASE 2 IMPACT:

The change affects FAST ARQs; FAST ARQs were brought in at Release ?.

DEPENDENCIES:

This fix has no particular dependencies.

DOES THE FIX REQUIRE ANY MANUAL DEPLOYMENT BASELINES:

The fix does not require any manual installation; it will just he a replacement file.

DEV EFFORT IN MANDAYS:

The coding cf the fix is complete, however further regression tests need to I,

2 days for further regression tests and the handover.

IMPACT ON USER:

HNGx transactions with duplicate JSNs may not be noticed. This will call into question the reliability of evidence presented by
the prosecution team.

IMPACT ON OPERATIONS:

The prosecution evidence will be more consistent and so prosecution cases will go though more smoothly.

                                                                                                                     FUJO0171848
HAVE RELEVANT KELS BEEN CREATED OR UPDATED?

It was not felt that a KEL was required because there arc only two people in the prosecution team and they are both fully aware
of the problem.

IMPACT ON HORIZON TO HNGX BRANCH MIGRATIONs

There is no impact on migration to HNGx. All ottices are now migrated to HNGx and so it is ompossible that anything would ; . . .- i.
this now.

IMPACT ON TEST:

The test team need to regression test Fast ARQs and filtering in slow ARQs. They need to run some specific tests when there at [:
duplicate Horizon transactions (they should just be ignored as theyare at the moment) and duplicate HNGx transactions (they will
now cause a Fast ARQ to fail which used not to be the case).

RISKS (of releasing and of not releasing proposed fix):

If the fix is not released then duplicate HNGx transactions will continue not to be noticed by the prosecution team which will
call into question their evidence.

There are no particuioo risks in releasing the fix. All QueryDLL fixes supplied recently have gone though with no reported
 roblems.

LIST OF LIKELY DELIVERABLES:

 ueryDLL.dll

LIST OF THE ABOVE ALREADY DELIVERED FOR THE PROPOSED RELEASE:

No on.

LIST OF THE ABOVE ALREADY DELIVERED TO A RELEASE LATER THAN THAT PROPOSED:

 one.

LIST OF THE ABOVE LIKELY TO BE REDELIVERED INTO THE PROPOSED OR A LATER RELEASE:

Sarah Selwyn has requested an audit maintenance release prior to the next DC_AUDIT planned release due to go live on 14/05/2011.

Five Peaks are requested for this maintenance release: PCO205805, PCO205806, PCO206531, PCO206590, PCO206622.

This is an edited version of the text of Sarah's original email to Sheila Bamber:

 e would like to get these Peaks targeted ASAP since these are impacting SSC and the Litigation Support Group in their support of
the Post Office litigations. There is a risk that these teams will not be able to fulfil their OLTs to the Post Office as defined
in SVM/SDM/SD/0017 (Security Service Management: Service Description).

 e would like to request an earlier test and deployment slot for PEAKs that are causing a significant business impact on the SSC
and Litigation Support teams ? the PEAKS for earlier deployment are:

PCO205805 and PCO25806 - Litigation Support Group need to detect/highlight duplicate JSNs - enhancements to AUW to support
duplicate JSN detection and reporting
PCO206531 - SSC ? takes too long to analyse events associated with ARQs due to the large volume of BAL events requires a chang:a
to the filtering of financially significant vs benign events. A change to the presentation of the events to SSC is also required
to speed the process up.


Testing acquirement a:

PCO205805 and PCO25806 ? use test files which include duplicate HNG-X transactions perform Fast ARQs which will now not tail or.
duplicate detection and checking the spreadsheet output which will now report overlaps and duplicates. Test Horizon ARQs with
duplicate JSN present to show duplicates ignored. Regression test for files with no duplicate JSNs both fast ARQ and filtering in
slow ARQs.
The BAL events reported in the event files output will now be of a smaller volume, nominated benign events will appear in the
rejects files (and this will constitute a large volume of total events) and the events spreadsheet will have a column heading at
the top of the spreadsheet. Regression test Gaps reporting is still present on spreadsheets. If time permits the workbook with a
number of spreadsheets as described in the PEAK rather than by manual process by the litigation team. However, this is yet t-.<- U--
confirmed.


(Since Sarah's original email PCO206590 and PCO206.622 have been raised to deal with issues around the large number of event :;.
PCO206531 is now solely to deal with the presentation of events.)

It has now been decided that the detection of duplicate HNGx messages will not terminate the FAST ARCs. Duplicates will be logged
 y QueryDLL at the server initially in QueryHandler.log and eventually in the close log both for Horizon and HNGx transactions.
Duplicate HNGx transactions will also be logged by the client in its spreadsheets but duplicate Horizon transactions will be
eliminated at the server silently since they are known always to be benign.
