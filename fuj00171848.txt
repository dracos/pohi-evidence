The Fast ARQ interface does not provide the user with any indication of duplicate records/messages.

This omission means that we are unaware of the presence of duplicate transactions. In the event that
duplicates are retrieved and returned to POL without our knowledge the integrity of the data provided
comes into question. The customer and indeed the defense and the court would assume that the duplicates
were bone fide transactions and this would be incorrect. There are a number of high profile court cases in
the pipeline and it is imperative that we provide sound, accurate records.

Jandy and T have looked at this. We think the method most compatible with existing behaviour is as follows -

FUJ00171848
FUJ00171848

[check for duplicates for HNGx In a Similar method to how duplicates are checked for in Horizon, For Horizon they are legitimately
logged in the audit log and then ignored (because it is just that identical messages are stored by mistake in more than one
transaction file). For HNGx, in the Fast ARQ case, their detection will cause them to be logged in the Queryhog and a count kept
lof how many there are; they will not be ignored.

ff this count is greater than 0 then bError will be set and the block of code
if (bError)
{

//The Fast ARC must be stopped.
CTraceFile::Trace (TL_ERROR,"The Fast ARQ is being terminated because there are %ld crypto errors, %ld errors and $1d
laps found.", 1fotalCryptoErrors, lfotalErrorsFound, 1TotalGapsFound) ;
set Status (CRFIQueryRequest ::E_ABSTRACT FILES FAILED) ;
return;

}
jodifed to log the number of duplicates found.

i will produce a prototype to confirm that behaviour is acceptable.

[DEVELOPMENT IMPACT OF FIX:

7:56 User:Gerald Barnes

SPECIFY THE HNG-X PLATFORMS IMPACTED:

the platform is set and is the "Audit Server"

IECHNICAL SUMMARY:
liNGx can rarely produce transactions with duplicate Journal Sequence Numbers. At the moment, when running a FAS ARQ on the audit
server, these duplicates are not noticed. This means that the evidence presented by the Prosecution Team may show duplicate
transactions without it being noticed; the Defence Team may spot this and call into the question the integrity of our data.

Ht was not felt that a KEL was required because there are only two people in the prosecution team and they are both fully aware
lof the problem.

IMPACT ON HORIZON TO HNGX BRANCH MIGRATIONS

[there is no impact on migration to HNGx. All offices are now migrated to HNGx and so it is impossible that anything would affect
this now.

IMPACT ON TEST:
[the test team need to regression test Fast ARQs and filtering in slow ARQs. They need to run some specific tests when there are

Sarah Selwyn has requested an audit maintenance release prior to the next DC AUDIT planned release due to go live on 14/05/2011.

rive Peaks are requested for this maintenance release: PC0205805, PC0205806, PC0206531, PC0206590, PC0206622.

[this is an edited version of the text of Sarah's original email to Sheila Bamber:

le would like to get these Peaks targeted ASAP since these are impacting SSC and the Litigation Support Group in their support of
the Post Office litigations. There is a risk that these teams will not be able to fulfil their OLs to the Post Office as defined
lin SVM/SDM/SD/0017 (Security Service Management: Service Description) .

je would like to request an earlier test and deployment slot for PEAKs that are causing a significant business impact on the SSC
land Litigation Support teams ? the PEAKs for earlier deployment are:

leco205805 and PC025806 - Litigation Support Group need to detect/highlight duplicate JSNs - enhancements to AUW to support
duplicate JSN detection and reporting

pco206531 - SSC ? takes too long to analyse events associated with ARQs due to the large volume of BAL events requires a change
to the filtering of financially significant vs benign events. A change to the presentation of the events to SSC is also required
to speed the proc

Sup.

eating requirements:

Jpco205805 and PC025806 ? use test files which include duplicate HNG-X transactions perform Fast ARQs which will now not fail on
Jtuplicate detection and checking the spreadsheet output which will now report overlaps and duplicates. Test Horizon ARQs with
duplicate JSN present to show duplicates ignored. Regression test for files with no duplicate JSNs both fast ARQ and filtering in
slow ARQs.

l'he BAL events reported in the event files output will now be of a smaller volume, nominated benign events will appear in the
rejects files (and this will constitute a large volume of total events) and the events spreadsheet will have a column heading at
the top of the spreadsheet. Regression test Gaps reporting is still present on spreadsheets. If time permits the workbook with a
Juumber of spreadsheets as described in the PEAK rather than by manual process by the litigation team. However, this is yet to be
confirmed.

(Since Sarah's original email PC0206590 and PC0206622 have been raised to deal with issues around the large number of events.
Pco206531 is now solely to deal with the presentation of events.)

It has now been decided that the detection of duplicate HNGx messages will not terminate the FAST ARCs. Duplicates will be logged
by QueryDLL at the server initially in QueryHandler.log and eventually in the close log both for Horizon and HNGx transactions.
jbuplicate HNGx transactions will also be logged by the client in its spreadsheets but duplicate Horizon transactions will be
eliminated at the server silently since they are known always to be benign.
