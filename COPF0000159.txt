FOS User: Andrew Lazzarin Workstatio:

Meeting with Robert Daily and Susan Winters of Post Office and Laura Irvine of
Brechin Tindal Oatts sols (advisor to PO) they will send me info to show who was
logged in for the relevant dates with suspect transactions and who was working
those days. They think that Horizon is not as bad as it is made out to be and
may be in a position to give us a statement in due course to say that the

relevant bits of the system worked properly. I should get a full transcript of
interview to see what acc said about use of logins
