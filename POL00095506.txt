+1 = You is currently in test in a selection of
branches and inclusion in the January events
is key but this will need careful but
inspirational positioning. We are working with
the events team to this effect.

Initiated a feasibility study to deliver this
capability and will integrate with Learning for
All and other initiatives. We are planning
delivery first quarter 2005

The proposition will be refined in a business
case seeking authority to proceed to contract
that will be presented to the February Board
meeting.

The legal fees represent the total
requirement to take the business through to a
new contract.

Submitted as agenda item.

Commenced as part of wider influencing
plan.

Article was submitted before the deadline for
the December issue. The article did not
appear and we will be asking the NFSP why
they did not use it.

Civil Orders: Where fraud had been perpetrated

Dec Board

I have received a report about the way we
apply Civil Orders as of now and‘am
concerned that we are not properly exploiting
the 2002 Proceeds on Crime Act. I have
asked, therefore, for a speedy update of our
procedures to do just that.

The specific action was to assess competing
financial services products and to
communicate that these would not be
covered by our compliance and AML training.
The latter has been done via focus
communications and an article will be
appearing in The Subpostmaster. A list of
competing products is being compiled.
Considering the continuation of the NFSP
subsidy will be undertaken in the light of
overall developments and information
gathered covering products (eg including
travel).
