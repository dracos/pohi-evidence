Subject: RE: Panorama

Mark,

As we have agreed with Mel, Fujitsu is NOT planning a separate response, but as always, we are
happy to support & contribute to the Post Office's rebuttal, and will refer any enquiries we receive
following the broadcast to your Press Office.

In terms of the whistle-blower, I guess my candid response is that we will need to see/hear what
they say, and then decide whether a response is required. However, we are NOT planning on the
need for a response - and to be clear - if we did feel the need having seen/heard it, we would
discuss that with Mel first.

Tam very happy to join a call, or leave it to Mel/my team - we are confident in how all parties
have acted in this situation, but these are some of the challenges that we have to face as major
brands - it was the same when I was doing your job, as I am sure it is for you today!

Simon, James.

As you will know Panorama is planning a programme on the Post Office and the Horizon
computer system on August 17. We have issued a very strong rebuttal and statement.

I understand that Fujitsu has issued a short line to the programme and I understand why. But as
you will know the programme plans to feature a whistleblower who will make allegations which
we are unsighted on except in broad terms.

I wanted to get a sense from you as to how you plan to respond: will you put someone up to deal
with media generated off the back of a Panorama? I am concerned that however far fetched the
allegations they could be regarded as "new" and a detailed rebuttal will be necessary.

Can you let me know your thoughts? We might also look to have a call today or next week?

Best wishes
Mark
