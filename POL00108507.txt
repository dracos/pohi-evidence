I think this needs to be escalated. I have copied Lesley and Chris for information. I do not see how Fujitsu can
keep putting back the date. They are expecting us to pay for this and we need to know exactly what we are
getting.

Chris/Lesley

This concerns an ongoing attempt to get Fujitsu to stop destroying data for a temporary period to ensure they do
not destroy data relating to cases in the Scheme between the time of the original application into the Scheme
and the submission of a full case questionnaire which will indicate exactly what data we need to extract from
Fujitsu to properly investigate the case.

Pete, Andy,

Due to various issues with dependencies, we need to revise the likely date that we would expect to be ina
position for you to approve suspension of data purging.

POL-0106604
POLO0108507
POL00108507

It is now unlikely that we would be able to implement the change any earlier than the last week in June.
In view of the attached email from the Change Sponsor, can you confirm that you do still want to proceed?

If so, our Change Management need you to contact your Commercial and Change Management teams, to
convert the ROM (3170) into a Change Request.
We can then convert our present CP into an 'implementation' CP and proceed accordingly.

Many thanks, and regards,

Andy

Further to our conversation yesterday, I have discussed with Chris and we have agreed that we should proceed
with the proposal from Fuzitsu to stop destroying data for a period of 6 months (with the possible extension to
12 months) as set out in the attached ROM.

However:

I understand that the ability to do this is on the basis that the audit data migration strategy is accepted
(referred to in the ROM as 'Change to Audit Data Migration Strategy; acceptance of new Storage (Fujitsu
CSHE) to store new Audit data as early as possible, ahead of completion of copying historic data from old
storage to new (which will also take longer)') and that you are proceeding with this project with the agreement
of Chris Aujard. Could you please resend him the email that you sent him setting out the details of this project.

I understand that Fujitsu have not provided us with an exact timescale within which they can actually
start the suspension of data purging but estimate that this can start no later than the back end of May. We must
have some indication of when that might happen before we finally sign this off - if there is a danger that there
will be slippage on this then we should not proceed. Is there any guarantee about the timescales, and, what is
the risk that the data migration strategy is delayed.

But subject to that, good to go asap.

Fujitsu have finally produced a ROM for this work.

If you are happy with the content and costs, we need to raise a new CR for them to do the work. Am I right to
assume that budget is available as part of the Branch Support Programme?

Please advise.

Both

Iam now going to raise a formal Change request (via Dave/Gerry) to get this assessed so we can make an
informed decision. My informal conversations with Fujitsu have unearthed some challenges to implementing
the request, we have a dependency on a project to upgrade the audit log data servers as these are currently
running out of space. It will be a few months before these servers are ready and our request could not be
implemented until then. There will also need to be some work to impact assess other aspects of the system,
once the request is submitted Fujitsu will inform us whether we there will be a charge for this impact
assessment.

Can you both confirm the requirement I am going to include in the CR. I am specifically interested in the
timescales as this will affect how much disc storage is required. I am out next week, if there are any updates or
decisions required (e.g. spending money) Gerry will be in touch.

Andy

Retention of Fujitsu data
Request that Fujitsu stop purging

- audit log data
- help desk call data (HSD call logs)

Post office envisages this policy will remain in place for 6 months but would like the flexibility to extend this
for additional months (up to a maximum of 6).

POL-0106604
At the end of this time PO would like Fujitsu to return to the current policy on purging data.
data retained during the above period would need to be purged in the usual way.

Belinda, I agree with your programme board comment below. I think the programme shoul

Re future cases, my view is that we should get a proper decision about suspension of destruction about non-
scheme cases. A proper retention policy exists for a purpose and I do not think we can put a blanket ban on
destruction. The issue is to make sure no information is destroyed relating to cases in the current Scheme.

I think we should get the prog. board to consider this, get a proper decision and then implement it.

Belinda,

So was I; I remembered having the conversation but couldn't recall the output and couldn't locate an e-mail
chain to support my understanding hence my note to Andy.

You will recall that this was raised at our Dec meeting with the investigators. For this particular case I believe
the info was located from another source (Kath will confirm). From this point on Shirley and Kath have
assessed their cases and made the necessary requests to Fujitsu - hence Andy's comments about the cases on the
cusp. So for the cases in the Scheme this shouldn't be a problem. Shirley and Kath - please action Belinda's
request in her note below.

Future cases that might come our way via whatever replaces the Initial Scheme might be a challenge. The
question therefore is for how long do we want to stop destroying information? I suspended destruction of paper
files at Iron Mountain over a year ago and this naturally adds to our cost base. We should be able to take an
informed decision on this once we know what follows the Initial Scheme.

I agree that we must do this and ask Fujitsu to make sure this happens and urgently. I was under the impression
that it had already been done. I had thought that it had been.

I would also like to know of any cases in the Scheme where we request data but cannot access it because it has
been destroyed and when the data was destroyed. Would that be possible?

We have not asked for this to happen, we agreed to prioritise cases on the cusp so we got the data required.

I can raise a CR requesting this but will probably need some impact assessment, there will also be a cost
associated.

Let me know if you want this to happen.

Andy,

I know we discussed this but I can't recall the detail of the conversation. Have we now asked Fujistu to suspend
destroying data when they reach the 7 year point? Tony Hooper has asked for reassurance on this across all our

date/information storage points.

Fujitsu have not been asked to retain records for longer. Fujitsu did however ask (in the scheduling meeting)
for any cases falling close to the 7 year retention limit so they could extract these.
