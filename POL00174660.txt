ALAN BATES & OTHERS v POST OFFICE LIMITED

Privileged Users — Draft Executive Summary

The Claimants in the Group Litigation have asserted that Post Office / Fujitsu has the ability to
add / delete / change transactions recorded by branches without the consent / knowledge of a
postmaster and that this may have been the cause of discrepancies in some of the Claimants’
branch accounts. We understand that the allegation has been formulated in several different
ways:

1.1.1 Post Office / Fujitsu have the ability to log on remotely to a Horizon terminal in a
branch so to conduct transactions.

1.1.2 Post Office / Fujitsu have the ability to conduct transactions (either remotely or locally)
under another user's ID.

1.1.3 Post Office / Fujitsu have the ability to push transactions into a branch's accounts
without either a postmaster's (a) knowledge or (b) consent.

1.1.4 Post Office / Fujitsu have the ability to amend or delete transactions entered by
branch staff on Horizon (and can do so in a way that is hidden from postmasters).

The way data was handled by Horizon materially changed in 2010 with the introduction of
Horizon Online. Horizon and Horizon Online therefore need to be addressed separately.

Horizon Online

In simple terms, data input in branches is not stored locally on systems in branch. The data is
sent on a transaction by transaction basis from the branch to the Branch Database (BRDB)
which is a central Post Office server (hosted by Fujitsu). The BRDB then disseminates that data
to various other places (such as Post Office finance systems, etc), including sending a copy to
the Audit Sto The Audit Store is another server hosted by Fujitsu and is intended to be the vel
master record Of all branch transactions. In usual circumstances, it holds that data for 7 years. ©
When branch staff lookup transaction records, the terminal in branch contacts the BRDB to
retrieve the necessary information. Given that branch accounts (as seen and operated in branch
by postmasters) draw on data from the BRDB, additions, edits or deletions in the BRDB could
impact upon branch accounts.

The integrity of transaction data (as recorded in branch and then communicated via the BRDB to
the Audit Store) is protected in the following ways-

1.5.1 Counter transactions (ie. those transactions that originate in branch due to the actions
of branch staff) are given a unique number of 1 greater than the previous transaction
so that the data can be checked for missing or duplicate transactions.

152 Counter transactions are also digitally signed (i.e. a unique “hash” is applied to each
message) so that the accuracy and validity of the transaction data can also be
checked.

1.5.3 Non-counter transactions (ie. those generated by Transaction Acknowledgements that
originate from Post Office) must be confirmed by branch staff before they are
accepted into the RDB. Once accepted, a copy of the raw data file is also sent direct
to the Audit Store.

1.5.4 When data is sent from the Branch Database to the Audit Store via the Audit Server it
is sealed (while in the Audit Server) and a database of sealed files is maintained so
that when data is subsequently retrieved from the Audit Store, its integrity can be
checked.

1.6 Setting aside the "remote access" issues discussed below, in our view:

1.6.1 the controls in Horizon are an effective way of ensuring that the transaction data input
by branch staff (counter and non-counter) is recorded in the BRDB and Audit Store;

1.6.2 it is extremely unlikely (though not impossible) that the data input by branch staff and
as recorded in the BRDB and the Audit Store would be incomplete or inaccurate;

1.6.3 in the event that data was incomplete or inaccurately recorded, the controls in Horizon
provide effective tools for identifying such issues; and

1.6.4 therefore a suitably skilled and qualified person could review the raw data from the
Audit Store to determine whether any data was incomplete or inaccurate.

‘7 In response to the allegations made at paragraph 1 above, we confidently believe that:

1.7.1 Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu have the ability tadog on remotely to a Horizon
terminal in a branch so to conduct transactions.

1.7.2 Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu have the ability to conduct transactions (either remotely
or locally) under another user 's ID (unless thatuser shares their password but this
would be a breach of operational procedure).”

1.7.3 Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu have the ability to push transactions into a branch's
accounts without either a postmaster's (a) knowledge or (b) consent, except for
Balancing Transactions:

(a) BTs are visible in the transaction log produced in branch and are displayed using
the unique identifier XXXX (which is different form the usual User ID that branch
staff would expect to see).

(b) BTs do not require formal acceptance through the Horizon terminal by branch
staff (unlike transaction corrections and transaction acknowledgements) and so
can be pushed into the branch accounts by Fujitsu.

1.7.4 Fujitsu (but not Post Office) has the ability to amend or delete transactions entered by
branch staff on Horizon — this is addressed below.

1.8 A limited number of authorised Fujitsu personnel have sufficient privileges to theoretically add /
delete / change data in the BRDB (Privileged Users). These users may also have access to
other systems, such as the Audit Store, however in the current circumstances access to the
BRDB is the most important as it is the BRDB that generates the branch accounts and is the
data used to hold postmasters liable for shortfalls.

1.9 Post Office personnel do not have this Privileged User access and we have seen no evidence to
make us believe that they ever had such access, however there is no historic record of all the
Privileged Users that there have ever been.

1.10 Changes to a branch's transaction data in the BRDB by Privileged Users would be visible to
branch staff. The amended transaction would show up in a transaction log produced in branch
but it would not be flagged as a change by a Privileged User and would appear like a normal
transaction generated in branch.

1.11. We would expect a system such as Horizon to have this type of Privileged User access as it will
be used to undertake maintenance on the system or to implement updates. Such access comes.
with a risk of it being misused, either by accident or maliciously. It is impossible to eliminate this
risk entirely (within Horizon or any other IT system) and so systems generally have robust
controls over the use of Privileged access so to reduce the risk or misuse or to make it
detectable.

we need to tone down wording somewhat.

1.12 Akey control in Horizon is the segregation of access permissions between Privileged Users who
can access the BRDB and those users who may access the Key Management Server (KMS).
The KMS holds the digital keys that underpin the controls listed in paragraph 1.5. Segregation
of Privileged Users from KMS users ensures that a Privileged User cannot get around the
controls in paragraph 1.5 and therefore cannot cover up any changes they make in the BRDB. If
a proper segregation of duties is in place, any changes by a single Privileged User to the BRDB
would be detectable in line with paragraph 1.6.4 above. This does not eliminate the risk of
misuse entirely as there could be a conspiracy between a Privileged user and a KMS user.

1.13 jwerough our enquiries, we have identified that certain current Privileged Users [how many?]
have access to the KMS such that they could theoretically cover up changes they make to the
BRDB data. This is a failure by Fujitsu to implement its own segregation of duties policy. We
are unable to determine how long this vulnerability has existed as records of historic users are
not kept.

1.14 Despite this vulnerability, in our view it is extremely unlikely that actions by a Privileged User
would be the cause of shortfalls in a branch.

1.15 First, Horizon has adequate functionality (in the form of transaction corrections and
balancing transactions) to resolve the vast majority of imaginable operational errors in
branch or technical errors in Horizon. There is therefore little need to use Privileged
access to manipulate transaction data so to resolve an error — such use would be very
rare and a last resort.

There is no perfect record of all Privileged User access, however our enquiries indicate
that Privileged Users only access the BRDB approximately XX times per month. A
sampling of the access logs shows that each access related to an authorised work order.
None of those work orders required a Privileged User to change any branch transaction
data (they related to wider system support). These enquiries therefore support the
conclusion that Privileged User access is nog hping used to change branch transaction
data as a matter of usual business practice.”

[Moreover, since July 2015 Horizon logs the actions of Privileged Users If a Privileged
User attempted to switch of the logging of their activities it would "break" the system. If
a Privileged User tried to delete the log of their actions that would log a delete action
(which would be highly unusual and therefore easy to spot), which means that a
Privileged User could never completely covered their tracks.]

1.16 I Second, any change to a branch's transactions in the BRDB by a Privileged User would
be visible to Post Office, Fujitsu and branch staff and Fujitsu has the data and expertise
to track down that the root cause of the change was the actions of a Privileged User.
This means that should a Privileged User have incorrectly changed a branch's
transaction data, it is very likely that it would be spotted and resolved.

1.17 Third, there is a theoretical risk of a Privileged User maliciously changing a branch's data
and successfully covering up that fact that those changes were made by the Privileged
User (due to Fujitsu's failure to segregate duties) but in our view this is a microscopically
small risk:

1.17.1 The steps that would need to be taken arthis to be successful are arduous
and complex. Few people in the world would have the technical expertise to
do this, it would require the writing of a bespoke computer programme, the
circumvention of several other control measures and deployment of the fraud
in a very small window of opportunity. We believe it would take weeks if not
months of work and planning to pull this off successful.

1.17.2 In light of the above, we cannot envisage any possible incentive or motivation

for why a Privileged User would do this absent being involved in some form of
massive criminal conspiracy.
