1. INTRODUCTION

This document provides a technical overview of the Pathway EPOSS
components. A short description of functionality and a diagram illustrating
relationships with other EPOSS and Riposte components is included for each
component.

The EPOSS Accounting and Reporting components are the subject of a
separate technical design document.

2. SCOPE

This document does not document the methods and properties exposed by
EPOSS components.

RUN-TIME OBJECTS

The run time objects are the EPOSS components that will be resident on each
Pathway terminal to drive the EPOSS functionality.

EPOSS CORE

The EPOSS Core Object implements the business rules surrounding Point of
Sale activities.

Driven by reference data, this component provides the functionality for
transacting Products. This functionality includes defining the Desktop User
Interface for data entry, committing transactions to the Desktop Stack and
managing integration with other applications.

All impulses (Token, Button and PLU) result in a call to the CallInterface of
EPOSS Core.

The Interaction between EPOSS Core and other Riposte and EPOSS
components is illustrated below :

EPOSS IMPULSE
The EPOSS Impulse Object handles the definition, management and routing of
all Impulses. Impulses fall into 3 categories :

1. Menu Hierarchy / Buttons

2. PLU Impulses

3. Token Impulses
Once defined, the Riposte Desktop and Validation Objects manage the
invocation of the required application whenever an Impulse fires. The EPOSS
Impulse definitions are defined by reference data. All Impulse reference data
is stored as persistent objects.
The diagram below illustrates the relationships between the EPOSS Impulse
Object and other EPOSS and Riposte components.

EPOSS SETTLEMENT

The Settlement Object has several responsibilities :

1. Ensuring that a session is not ended until the session balance is

zero;

2. Providing quick access to designated EPOSS Products (Settlement
Products);
3. Providing fast settlement (automatic generation of a balancing
transaction) using designated EPOSS Products (Settlement
Products);
4. Generation of a Session record;
5. Consolidation of Session information for subsequent receipt
production.

The EPOSS Settlement Object integrates with the Riposte Retail Broker using
existing hooks. All committal of transaction and session information to the
Journal is handled by the Retail Broker.

Relationships between the EPOSS Settlement Object and other EPOSS and
Riposte components is illustrated below :

EPOSS LOOKUP

The EPOSS Lookup Object allows EPOSS components to retrieve reference
data items from the Journal. This extra layer of abstraction from standard
Riposte facilities is provided for a number of reasons.

1. To simplify the complex problems of EPOSS reference data management
by providing hidden mechanisms controlling the availability of persistent
objects in the office;

2. To provide a caching mechanism for commonly accessed persistent objects
if necessary;

3. To provide commonly required functions for accessing collections of
persistent objects.

The lookup server is used by all EPOSS components making use of reference
data (persistent objects).

EPOSS STOCK UNIT

The EPOSS Stock Unit Object provides functionality surrounding the area of
Stock Unit management and information about the currently logged on User /
Stock Unit. Functions include :

1. Provision of Stock Unit Attachment information;

2. Provision of current Accounting Period information (Cash Account
Week and Balance Period);

Validation of Stock Unit logon;

Creation / Deletion of Attachments;

Creation / Deletion of Stock Units;

Management of Stock Unit Smart Cards

yy

a

The various Stock Unit Management functions will result in the creation,
deletion or amendment of Persistent Objects and Stock Unit Smart Card
contents.

The information provided by the EPOSS Stock Unit Object regarding the
currently logged on Stock Unit session is used by the EPOSS Settlement
Object and EPOSS Core Object when writing Session and Transaction through
the retail broker.

The following diagram illustrates the Relationships between EPOSS Stock
Unit and other EPOSS and Riposte components.

EPOSS BALANCE

The EPOSS Balance Object provides the EPOSS balancing functionality.
Responsibilities include :

1. Validation of a balance request (ensuring all required pre-balancing
activities such as Cash Declaration are complete);

2. Production of the Balance Report using the Report Server;

3. Control of rollover into the next balancing period and production of
required opening stock figures persistent objects;

EPOSS DATA SERVER

The EPOSS Data Server provides a generic summarisation mechanism
whereby Journal messages can be grouped and totalled using a reference data
driven Accounting and Reporting hierarchy.

The Data Server is used primarily by the EPOSS Report Server to group and
summarise for individual reports. It is also used by the EPOSS Balance Object
to transparently derive product totals for the production of opening figures as
part of the rollover process.

The Data Server is driven by a hierarchy of Nodes and Accumulates. The
design of the Reporting and Accounting Hierarchy is the subject of a separate
Technical design document and is not described fully here.

The relationship between the EPOSS Data Server and other EPOSS and
Riposte components is illustrated below :

EPOSS REPORT SERVER

The EPOSS Report Server provides all of the EPOSS Reports and Receipts.
The Report layouts are defined by reference data and stored as Riposte
persistent objects.

The EPOSS Report Server is only concerned with the presentation aspects of
reporting, making use of the EPOSS Data Server to derive grouping and
summarisation values.

The Report Server provides the ability to output to either Counter Printer,
Back Office Printer or Print Preview window. For printing, standard Windows

printer drivers are used.

The reference data that defines report layouts is the subject of a separate
technical design document and is not described in full here.

Server and other EPOSS and Riposte components.
