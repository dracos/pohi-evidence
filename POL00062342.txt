I recommend we challenge by having Susan follow up her letter to BBC Legal with a phone call to then
legal contact and record the challenge.

BBC will likely respond that its editorial, but we can then press for a single editorial point of contact
{Radio 5 liklley to be different from One Show etc).

Please confirm if you’re happy.

Absolutely agree re challenging - this is the kind of area where we need to do so.

Hi All

There was a piece on BBC 1 lunchtime news today featuring Julian Wilson and JA. Very
similar messaging to the Radio 5 piece. A couple of Matt Prodger’s comments seem to
go too far though. He says that the issue does not affect every Post Office, which
implies a large number affected and that there is little evidence that this has affected
customers, as we know there is no evidence. This feels like something we should
challenge.

No sign of anything on BBC Look North.
