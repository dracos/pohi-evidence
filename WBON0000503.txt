Andy,

The CCRC have asked a few further questions about the KEL.

I have put my comments in red below. Is there anything you would add?

Thanks

Paul

We note the description at paragraph 50(4) of the defence, and also your previous description by email dated
13 November 2016. Taken together, I think these answer most of Amanda’s original questions about the KEL.
However, can I please ask:

e Paragraph 50(4) of the defence refers to the KEL as a “document” in the singular, am I right in
thinking it exists as a single document rather than multiple different logs? YES, IT IS A SINGLE
DOCUMENT

e In terms of scale, in your email of 13/11/2016 you referred to “thousands of entries” and
“voluminous entries” in the KEL, is it possible to say how many pages the document runs to?
ANDY — PRESUMABLY ONLY FJ COULD ANSWER THIS? DOES THIS QUERY
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE USUAL PROCESS OF BEING PUT IN A QUEUE OF
QUESTIONS FOR FJ OR ARE YOU HAPPY FOR ME TO ASK PETE NEWSOME
(MY PREVIOUS FJ CONTACT ON THE KEL) DIRECT?

e In your email of 13/11/2016 you stated: “We have asked Fujitsu for some random examples of
these entries, and will provide these to you in due course”. I don’t think we have received any
examples to date. I would be grateful if we could see some sample pages, as this would give us
a clearer idea of the kind of information the KEL contains, and whether further analysis of the
document is likely to be of any relevance to our review. WE HAVE THE EXAMPLES BELOW
FROM FJ. I WILL SUGGEST ROD PROVIDES THESE WITH HIS NEXT UPDATE EMAIL TO THE
CCRC.
