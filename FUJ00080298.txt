POA Operations Incident Management Procedure

Fe)
FUJITSU

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

1. Introduction

1.1 Owner

The owner of the Incident Management process at the local POA account level is the Fujitsu POA
Service Delivery Manager responsible for Incident Management within the POA account.

1.2 Objective

The objective of this document is to define the procedure for Incident Management in the POA
environment. The procedure is the local implementation of the Fujitsu corporate Incident Management
process (C-MSv1.3). Reference to process in this document is within the context of the corporate
document C-MSv1.3. For the purpose of this document an Incident is defined as:

“Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may cause, an
interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.”

The quality of the service includes the protection of the confidentiality of business, personal and card data
as defined by the POA Information Security Policy (SVM/SEC/POL/0003).

The document applies to all Incidents raised by the POA MAC or by SMC (out of hours or from systems
monitoring tools), where they are related to the Fujitsu outsourcing contract. N.B calls presented to POA
MAC / SMC that should be placed with the Atos Service Desk are transferred/ referred from POA MAC /
SMC to Atos Service Desk.

For clarity; Post Office Limited (the customer) appointed Atos as their Service Integrator including the
primary service desk function (Atos Service Desk, which may also be referred to as SISD).

The scope of the process is from the receipt of an incident by the MAC / SMC, through to the successful
workaround or resolution of the incident.

For clarity, it should be noted that the MAC team are responsible for managing/owning Incidents between
08.00 and 20.00 Monday to Friday, 08.00 to 17.00 Saturday and Bank Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding
Christmas Day. The SMC assume this responsibility out of hours, i.e., outside these hours. The SMC are
responsible for escalation of incidents to the POA OOH Duty Manager.

The key objectives of the process are (C-MSv1.3)

Log, track and close all types of incident requests

Respond to all types of incident requests

Restore agreed service to the business as soon as possible

Resolve incidents within the target timescales set for each priority level within the Service Level
Agreement(s)

Resolve a high number of requests at first contact

Ensuring incident priorities are linked to business priorities

Keeping the user informed of progress

Reduced unplanned downtime

Improved Customer satisfaction

1.3 Process Rationale

The primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal service operation as quickly
as possible, thereby minimising adverse impact to the business. In turn, this ensures the highest level of

service quality and availability. Normal service operation is defined here as service operation within
Service Level Targets (SLT).

Demonstrating a professional approach to Atos, the Service Integrator contracted to POL, and Post
Office Limited (the customer) and their clients.

1.4 Mandatory Guidelines

It is important to maintain a balance between:
a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer
c) Assessing which incidents are major

The following guidelines should be adhered to.

e During the MAC Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 20:00 and Saturday 08:00 — 17:00 and
Bank Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding Christmas Day.) the MAC should be the first point of
operational contact between Fujitsu and the Atos Service Desk. Outside these hours the SMC.
acts as the first point of contact.

e Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the MAC is handed over to the SMC
outside the MAC Core Hours.

2 ‘Inputs

The inputs to this process are:

e  AllIncidents reported by Contact with the MAC / SMC. Contact is defined as voice, e-mail, incident
transfers over the HDI interface from the Atos Service Desk or Tivoli Alert as the methods of
communication with the MAC / SMC and fall into the following categories:

°

oo000

°

Business process error

Hardware or software error

Request for information e.g. progress of a previously reported Incident
User complaint

Network Error

Logging via HNG-X web interface

e Severity and SLT information.

¢ Evidence of an Error.

e System Alerts received automatically from transaction monitoring tools. Due to the urgent nature of
some of these alerts, they may be dealt with directly by SSC, with an update of workaround or
resolution supplied to MAC / SMC. It should be noted that these alerts enter the process at step 3,
and are not subject to steps 1 & 2 of this process.

Risks and Dependencies

3.1 Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation procedures.
Non-availability of the MAC / SMC Incident Management System. Mitigation is given in the MAC /
SMC Business Continuity Plan.

Non-availability of the HDI interface with the Atos Service Desk.

Non-availability of the OTI links to core & external service desk tools.

Lack of information given to the MAC / SMC regarding changes, Atos or POL Business updates,
request for changes, status of Problems etc. Processes must be followed to lessen this risk, such as
the Change Management and Problem Management Processes.

Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff

Unavailability of sufficient tools for Incident diagnosis

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems

The provision of inadequate staff training within the MAC / SMC, SDU's or 3" party suppliers
Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering.

3.2 Dependencies

This process is dependent on:

Effective Incident handling by the MAC / SMC
The known error information being available and kept up to date with all errors as the root cause
becomes known to Problem Management

« Knowledge database kept up to date with POL business and services knowledge

¢ Fujitsu infrastructure support of the MAC / SMC tools

e Appropriate training plans / skills transfer of desk agents.

e Appropriate training needs to include hardware, software and networks support staff, SDU's and 3"
party suppliers

e Effective routing of calls to SDUs and third parties

e Effective escalation procedures and the maintenance thereof within Fujitsu, POL and third parties

e Governance of Incident / Problem Management procedures

e Effective feedback to POL through Service Management ORFs, contributing to end user education
and reduced Incident rates.

e Internal feedback to improve the Incident / Management Process.

e SLT and OLA knowledge and understanding across all Fujitsu and 3 party support

e POA, SDU and 3% party consistent co-operation in incident identification and resolution

Throughout the Incident, the MAC / SMC retains ownership for monitoring and keeping the call raiser
informed of progress, unless the incident is specifically software related, in which case SSC hold the
responsibility for confirming details of closure.

The MAC / SMC manages the complete end-to-end Incident process.
Activities include:

Regularly monitoring the status and progress towards resolution of all open Incidents

Note Incidents that move between different specialist support groups, indicative of uncertainty and
possibly a dispute between support staff

Give priority for Incident monitoring to high-impact Incidents

Keep affected users informed of progress without waiting for them to call, thus creating a pro-active
profile

Monitors SLT and escalates accordingly. If an Incident has no associated KEL or, it is complex and
involves multiple SDU's, or if it has been unresolved for an extended period, MAC will alert the POA SDM
to the existence of a pattern likely to produce a Problem.

Updating MAC / SMC TfS Knowledge Articles from information supplied from SSC KEL. This may be
applied as a direct copy or amended for use by the agents, dependant upon the technical complexity of

9 Appendix A: Security Incident Reporting

9.1 Scope

This annex outlines the process regarding the investigation, and reporting of all security incidents
concerning the HORIZON Network and all IT equipment, and any Payment Brand incident (PCI).

9.2 Aim

The aim of these instructions is to ensure that details of all IT related security incidents are reported to
one central point and that any follow up investigations are managed in an efficient and auditable manner.

9.3 Changes

These work instructions are primarily for use by the MAC team, the POA Security Team, the POL
Security Team, and SSC staff. Approval from POL is to be gained before any significant changes to the
work instructions are implemented. All readers are encouraged to propose changes to Work Instructions,
in writing, to the POA Security Manager.

All incident documentation is subject to review and update by the business continuity and information
security teams as part of the lessons learnt process following an incident and following the annual review
of the incident process as part of business continuity.

9.4 POL Incident Handling Guidance

All POL incidents will still be handled in accordance with existing POL guidelines. This document does
not replace these, or, indeed, replace any part of the content - rather it lays down the POA framework
under which the work is carried out.

9.5 IT Incidents

9.5.1 Incident Definition

9.5.1.1 An information security Incident is: "an adverse event or series of events that compromises
the confidentiality, integrity or availability of Fujitsu Services Post Office Account information or
information technology assets, having an adverse impact on Fujitsu Services and/or Post Office Ltd
reputation, brand, performance or ability to meet its regulatory or legal obligations." This will also extend
to include assets entrusted to Fujitsu including data belonging to Post Office Ltd, its clients and its
customers.

9.5.2 Incident Categories

Incidents can be categorised in many ways, they can occur alone or in combination with other incident
categories and can vary significantly in severity and impact. It is important that all incidents are
recognised and acted upon.

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

9.5.2.1 For the purpose of illustrating the impact of incidents two levels of severity have been
defined (Note: in practice the assessment may be less straightforward):

A MINOR incident will normally have limited and localised impact and be confined to one domain,
resulting in one or more of the following:

e Loss or unauthorised disclosure of internal or sensitive material leading to minor
exposure, or minor damage of reputation

e Loss of integrity within the system application or data, leading minimal damage of
reputation; minimal loss of customer / supplier / stakeholder confidence; negligible cost of
recovery

e Loss of service availability within the domain, leading to reduced ability to conduct
business as usual; negligible loss of revenue; minimal loss of customer / supplier /
stakeholder confidence; negligible cost of recovery

e Individual attempts to breach network security controls shall be treated as a minor
security breach.

e Subject to discussions with the POA Duty manager due to high volume of calls relating to
the same type of incident it may well be a requirement to follow the POA Major Incident
Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) following the advice from the POA Duty Manager.

A MAJOR incident will have a significant impact on the Network Banking Automation Community
resulting in one of more of the following:

e Loss or unauthorised disclosure of confidential or strictly confidential material, leading to
brand or reputation damage; legal action by employees, clients, customers, partners or
other external parties

e Loss of integrity of the applications or data, leading to brand or reputation damage; loss
of customer / supplier / client confidence; cost of recovery

e Loss of service availability for applications or communications networks, leading to an
inability to conduct business as usual; loss of revenue; loss of customer / supplier / client
confidence; cost of recovery

e Aconcerted attempt or a successful breach of network security controls shall be treated
as a major security breach.

NB. For a Major Incident the POA Major Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) should be followed.

9.5.3. Examples of IT Incidents
e Theft of IT equipment / property, including software
«Malicious damage to IT equipment /property, including software
e Theft or loss of Protectively Marked, caveat or sensitive IT Data.
e Actual or suspected attacks on the Fujitsu Services POA Network or Information System.

e Potential compromise of systems or services at the Data Centre through evidence
retrieved and presented by Police or POL's card acquirer.

e Attacks on Fujitsu Services Post Office Account personnel via Information Systems. (I.e.
Harassment, Duress

The above list is a non exhaustive list of examples. Any other IT related incidents
reported, will be considered and passed to the appropriate authority for action.

9.5.4 Containment

Whenever an Incident is identified which presents a serious threat to conduct normal business it should
be contained and isolated as quickly as possible. This will mean Platforms that appear to have suffered
virus attack or other malicious code attack need to be quarantined immediately to prevent further spread.
It may also be necessary to isolate network connections that appear to be the source for Denial of
Service threats or where they have been subjected to suspected hacking attack.

If the incident relates to card data, the environment may be subject to a Forensic Investigation imposed
by POL's merchant acquirer. In this instance log data will need to be reviewed and analysed.

9.6 Reporting

9.6.1.1 Anyone reporting a security Incident should be encouraged to notify their Line Manager in the
first instance. The Line Manager will gather as much detail of the incident as possible, following company
procedures. He or she will undertake an initial local investigation into the incident, ensuring that in the
case of missing equipment or materials that they have not just been misplaced. Information gathered will
be entered into the initial case report template (ICR).

9.6.1.2 If the severity of the Incident is considered as Minor but warrants further investigation the
Line Manager should immediately log a call with the MAC team, stating that they are reporting a security
incident, giving brief details. Please note that in certain cases there may be circumstances where no
details of a sensitive nature should appear on the call log. Having logged the call and obtained a call
reference number, the Line Manager may then continue with the investigation, and act as a liaison
between the person reporting and all concerned parties. Once logged, the investigation will thereafter be
referred to by the Call Number.

9.6.1.3 All Incidents reported to the MAC team with a call reference and even when classified as
Minor should still be forwarded to POA Security Management to determine if there is a Security Impact. It
is important that for any incident investigated the correct procedures are adopted regarding evidence, as
the information collected and recorded may be used for evidential purposes at a later date

9.6.1.4 If the severity of the Incident is considered as Major the Incident details must be reported
directly to the POA Security Manager immediately. Contact details are available on Café VIK. Depending
on the type of Incident and the severity of the incident POA Security will make the decision to escalate
the details to the POL Security. In the case of Data Centre incidents specifically Security will also inform
the Data Centre Manager if this has not already been done. Regardless of the severity of the incident,
when a compromise in card data occurs the incident must be reported to POL Security so that POL can
comply with it's contractual obligations with it's card acquirer.

9.6.1.5 In the event of a Major Incident Security trigger for Fujitsu Services Property, the POA
Security Manager MUST inform the Group Property Security Team who will be alerted either by
telephone on a 24/7 basis or the next working day via our Incident Reporting process and the actual or
potential impact of the incident dictates which route is followed.

The Group Property Security Team then take responsibility for interfacing into the corporate process by
entering reports on to the corporate system

9.6.1.6 In all cases relevant details should only be recorded and discussed as necessary between
the person investigating or Line Manager dealing with it and any relevant parties who need to be included
in the investigation. Information on any incident must not be passed to anyone who is not directly
involved with the investigation without the authority of POA Security Manager and the POL Head of
Information Security.

9.6.1.7 I Once a call is raised with the SSC the call will then be placed on the call stack of the POA
Security Team, who will monitor the incident, assist or advise the Line Manager if required, and be
available to take over the investigation should the need arise, but always be able to respond, within 2

9.7 Investigation

9.7.1 Policy

Although all security incidents will initially be reported to the POA Security Manager in order to have one
point of contact for all parties, some or all of the investigation requirements may be passed to one or
more of the following for further action. The decision of delegation will be determined by the POA Security
Manager in association with POL Information Security Incident Manager.

9.7.2 POL Security / Investigation Team

9.7.2.1 In the event that the reporting of an incident is passed to POL Security or the Investigation
Team, all details of the investigation, and final outcome or reference details, should be recorded on the
initial case report (ICR) and details will be recorded in the security Incident Log. It is important that for any
incident investigated the correct procedures are adopted regarding evidence, as the information collected
and recorded may be used for evidential purposes at a later date.

9.7.2.2 In the event that the POA Security Manager takes ownership of an investigation, he will
report the results to POL Head of Information Security and POL's Business Continuity Manager.

9.7.2.3 During any investigation the Investigator must comply with the appropriate legislation and
compliance requirements and regulatory or standard requirements.

9.7.2.4 All initial investigations should be carried out at the earliest opportunity and any queries
should be directed to POA Security Manager. Investigation must be reliable, stand up to scrutiny and
potential cross-examination and evidence must be properly obtained, recorded and time stamped.

9.7.3 External Investigator

9.7.3.1 Should it be considered necessary the incident might be passed to an external Investigator or
forensics team, who will ensure that any data required for evidential purposes is captured and
investigated using a systematic approach which ensures that an auditable record of evidence is
maintained and can be retrieved. In some cases, where a compromise to card data is involved, two
Forensic Investigation teams may be involved. One team operating on behalf of POL gathering the
required audit logs to use to analyse and investigate the problem. A second Forensic Investigations team
may be imposed to investigate on behalf of the card acquirer and card schemes. In all incidences where
a Forensic Investigation is involved, the Forensic Investigators will be shadowed by POL's Legal and
Security Teams.

9.7.4 Evidence Rules

9.7.4.1 Rules of Evidence

Before undertaking security incident investigation and computer forensics it is essential that investigators
have a thorough understanding of the Rules of Evidence. The submission of evidence in any type of legal
proceedings generally amounts to a significant challenge, but when computers are involved the problems
are intensified. Special knowledge is needed to locate and collect evidence, and special care is required
to preserve and transport evidence. Evidence in computer crime cases differs from traditional forms of
evidence in as much as most computer related evidence is intangible and is in the form of electronic
pulse or magnetic charge, hence the need to use specialist teams. That said the information collected
and recorded from the Operational areas is equally important and must be recorded with due care and
diligence.

9.7.4.2 Types of Evidence

Many types of evidence can be offered in court to prove the truth or falsity of a given fact.
The most common forms of evidence are Direct, Real, Documentary and Demonstrative.
Direct Evidence

Direct evidence is oral testimony whereby the knowledge is obtained from any of the witness's five
senses and is in itself proof or disproof of a fact in issue. Direct evidence is called to prove a specific act
such as an eye witness statement.

Real Evidence

Real evidence also known as associative or physical evidence is made up of tangible evidence that
proves or disproves guilt. Physical evidence includes such things as tools used in the crime, and
perishable evidence capable of reproduction etc. The purpose of physical evidence is to link the suspect
to the scene of the crime. It is that evidence that has material existence and can be presented to the view
of the court and jury for consideration.

Documentary Evidence

Documentary evidence is presented to the court in forms of business records, manuals, printouts etc.
Much of the evidence submitted in a computer crime case is documentary evidence.

Demonstrative Evidence

Demonstrative evidence is evidence used to aid the jury. It may be in the form of a model, experiment,
chart or an illustration offered as proof.

9.7.5 Process

In most cases response to a reported incident the initial investigation will be carried out by a nominated
investigator normally the POA Security Manager or his nominated deputy. POA and POL Security
Teams will be on hand to provide backup and assistance if required. When seizing evidence from a
computer related crime the investigator will collect any and all physical evidence such as the personnel
computer, peripherals, notepads and documentation etc., in addition to computer generated evidence.

There are four types of Computer generated evidence:
e Visual Output on a monitor
e Printed evidence on a plotter
e Printed evidence on a printer

e Film recordings on such digital media as disc, USB stick, log files, tape or cartridge, and optical
representation on either CD or DVD.

The investigator will endeavour to obtain as much original evidence as possible. In the event of a court
appearance the court prefers the original evidence rather that a copy but will accept a duplicate if the
original is lost or destroyed or is in the possession of a third party who cannot be subpoenaed.

9.7.5.1 Following the initial investigation and where considered appropriate, the investigator will
report to/ liaise with the local Police and/or other external Agencies; this will only be done following
consultation with the POL Head of security and POL Head of Information Security or substitute.

9.7.5.2 Copies of the initial and follow up reports will be submitted to relevant authorities and details
of all investigations will be held on file by the POA Security to aid any subsequent trend analysis.

9.8 REMEDIAL ACTION

9.8.1 On Completion of report

When the final report of an investigation has been completed, it should be passed to the relevant
authority for follow up action, the results of which should be referred back to the POA Security Manager.

9.8.2 Completion of Investigation

When an investigation is closed the POA Security Manager will ensure all details of the investigation
have been recorded and can be made available for subsequent future analysis.

9.8.3. UNIRAS Reporting

On call closure, the POA Security Team will complete and notify UNIRAS where required. Thereafter the
incident will be reviewed to identify the lessons learnt and the processes and relevant documentation will
be updated as appropriate.
