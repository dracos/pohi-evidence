WITNESS STATEMENT OF TORSTEIN OLAV GODESETH

I, TORSTEIN OLAV GODESETH of Lovelace Road, Bracknell, Berkshire RG12 8SN
WILL SAY as follows:

1 I am employed by Fujitsu Services Limited (Fujitsu) as Chief Architect on the

Post Office Account.

2. I am authorised to make this statement on behalf of Post Office Limited (Post
Office), the Defendant in these proceedings, in relation to the Horizon Issues trial
listed for March 2019. This is my second witness statement in relation to these
proceedings and has been prepared in response to the witness evidence
submitted by the Claimants and the report submitted by the Claimants' IT expert,
Mr Coyne.

3. The facts set out in this statement are within my own knowledge, or if they are
outside my knowledge, I have explained the source of my information or belief.
As I described in my first witness statement, Horizon is a large system and
therefore it is not possible for one person to have a complete understanding of all
corners of the system. I have therefore consulted with colleagues who work in
the areas that are covered by this statement to ensure that my understanding of
them, and the issues related to them, is correct. I have identified those

colleagues below.

4. My background and roles at both Post Office and Fujitsu is set out at paragraphs
5-7 of my first witness statement dated 27 September 2018.

5. In this statement I:

5.1 respond to certain points made in the witness statement of Charles Alastair
McLachlan;

5.2 explain how certain bugs in the Horizon system came to light and were resolved;

5.3 respond to paragraphs 5.156 and 5.159 of the report by Jason Coyne, the
Claimants’ IT expert; and

5.4 respond to paragraph 2.5 c) of the witness statement of lan Rutherford

witness statement.
THE ROLE OF PROFESSOR MCLACHLAN IN THE TRIAL OF SEEMA MISRA

7. In order to respond to Professor McLachlan's statement, I think it is important to
first set out the background in relation to the case of Seema Misra (who I

understand from Post Office's solicitors to be a Claimant in these proceedings).
8. I understand from Post Office's solicitors that:

8.1 Ms Misra was a Subpostmaster at the West Byfleet Post Office who was charged
with theft amounting to £74,609.84 and false accounting, in that she had made

false entries on Horizon to cover up the theft;

8.2 Ms Misra pleaded guilty to false accounting and not guilty to theft, but she was
convicted of theft by a jury on 21 October 2010.

8.3 Post Office was represented by Cartwright King, who have informed Post Office's
solicitors that

8.3.1 Professor McLachlan’s final report dated 4 October 2010 consisted of a
series of anecdotal assertions suggesting issues with Horizon but gave
no direct example and no evidence in support of his conclusions, save

for a short email from Gareth Jenkins at Appendix C of the report; and

8.3.2 on the issue of disclosure, the defence in the case of Seema Misra
made repeated applications for disclosure which, both in Cartwright
King's view and in the opinion of the trial Judge, amounted to little more

POL00029051
POL00029051
9.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

than ‘fishing expeditions’. At the commencement of the substantive trial
the trial Judge was again called upon to rule in a disclosure application

and again he refused to direct further disclosure.

Professor McLachlan put forward a number of hypothetical problems with Horizon
in an interim report dated 21 September 2009 and further reports on 19
November 2009, 3 February 2010, 12 February 2010, 25 February 2010 and 30
September 2010 before submitting his final report on 4 October 2010. Many of
his points related to process issues rather than technical issues with Horizon and
they had been discussed with Fujitsu prior to the trial, as can be seen from
Professor McLachlan's reports, in particular the "summary of findings" section of

his final report.

Professor McLachlan alleges at paragraph 9 of his statement that he "found it
difficult to obtain all of the information and disclosure which [he] thought was
necessary in order to provide [his] opinion to the criminal court’. However, I
understand from Gareth Jenkins that Professor McLachlan requested information
that was not necessary and/or obtainable. For example, he wanted to undertake
a forensic examination of the old Horizon system but this could not be examined
as the last Horizon counter had been removed prior to Ms Misra's trial in October
2010.

PROFESSOR MCLACHLAN'S WITNESS STATEMENT

11.

I agree with Cartwright King that Professor McLachlan's report consists of a series
of anecdotal assertions that there could be issues with Horizon without providing
any direct examples or evidence in support (save for one email from Gareth
Jenkins of Fujitsu (who acted as Post Office's expert witness in the Misra case)
which relates to an issue which occurred at the Callendar Square branch in
Falkirk which was shown to have not affected Ms Misra's branch). I address
those assertions below.

CALLENDAR SQUARE

12.

13.

At paragraph 10 of his statement Professor McLachlan states that he "became
aware, extremely close to the initial listing of the trial of Mrs Misra, of a bug in the

Horizon system known as Calendar (sic) Square".

The Callendar Square bug occurred in 2005 (it therefore related to Legacy
Horizon). At that time I was working as an independent contractor to Post Office,
acting as a technical advisor on IT projects. While I do not have first-hand
knowledge of the issue, I have reviewed documents relating to the issue {POL-
0296514, POL-0296843, POL-0011264, POL-0017084, POL-0444055 and POL-

0444056} and discussed it with Gareth Jenkins and my understanding is as

follows:-

The issue was discovered when the Subpostmaster at the Callendar Square
branch reported that he could see a transfer on some terminals but not on
another and asked for this to be investigated. The Subpostmaster had
experienced a receipts and payments mismatch when balancing one of their
stock units, as can be seen from PC0126376 {POL-0296843};

Sometimes it is necessary to transfer cash between different stock units in a
branch. For example, one stock unit may be running short on cash, so the
Subpostmaster or branch staff may transfer some cash from stock unit A to stock
unit B. Another example is that cash received into a branch is remitted (or
remmed) into one stock unit creating a need to distribute that cash among the
other stock units so that they are all equipped to perform transactions;

Horizon handled the transfer by requiring the Subpostmaster to complete a
Transfer Out transaction for one stock unit and a corresponding Transfer In
transaction for the receiving stock unit. The Transfer Out transaction resulted in a
message containing relevant details about the transfer being created and
replicated to all counters in the branch. The Transfer In transaction used details
from the message to complete the transfer, as confirmed in PC0126376 {POL-
0296843};

A bug in the Riposte software which was used to replicate data between counters
in the branch at the time meant that when the Subpostmaster completed the
Transfer In on one terminal, the message indicating he had done so was not
replicated to all the other terminals and he was able to duplicate the Transfer In at
a second terminal {POL-0296843};

Once the bug had been reported by the Subpostmaster and investigated by
Fujitsu, advice was provided to Subpostmasters by Post Office. I have not seen
this advice but I understand from speaking to Gareth Jenkins that it would have
told Subpostmasters to take extra care in handling transfers and to avoid

duplicating Transfers;

If a Subpostmaster inadvertently duplicated a Transfer this meant that when the
Subpostmaster came to balance the branch's stock units, while the total for the
amount of receipts into the system and the total for the amount of payments out of
the system should have matched (owing to the double entry book-keeping

principle), in this case they did not match;

14.1

14.2

14.3

15.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

I understand from Gareth Jenkins that this mismatch would have also resulted in

a reconciliation failure being flagged to Fujitsu in Horizon overnight processing;

I also understand from Gareth that when the error occurred, Riposte was
attempting to replicate messages to terminals and a system event was raised
indicating that there was a problem (i.e. saying a timeout had occurred). The
system event was visible to Fujitsu;

The bug was fixed in a new release of the Riposte software received from Escher
{POL-0296843}.

As Professor McLachlan notes in paragraph 12 of his statement, "Mr Jenkins
concluded that the Calendar (sic) Square did not impact Mrs Misra's branch." I
understand from Mr Jenkins that Professor McLachlan was in agreement with Mr
Jenkins’ conclusion. Mr Jenkins summarised the reasons for this in his email to
Mr McLachlan of 8 March 2010 and I agree with those reasons. In summary:-

the manifestation of the bug was clearly visible in the branch records for
Callendar Square, whereas there was no sign of its occurrence in Ms Misra's

branch records;

the bug had been resolved more than a year before the relevant period in Ms
Misra's branch by the software fix distributed to the entire network in March 2006,
ie. the "S90 Release"; and

Mr McLachlan was provided with the West Byfleet event log' which showed him
that the events associated with Callendar Square were not present at Ms Misra's
branch. The problem at Callendar Square produced a visible trace of “events” in
the event logs, in particular, an event called “time out waiting for lock” which
means that information which Horizon was trying to communicate to the terminal
(i.e. the Transfer) was effectively locked out from the terminal. In the Callendar
Square branch, this problem was visible on the event logs multiple times (which
are available to Subpostmasters in branch). It could also be checked on any
Balance Reports or Branch Trading Statements from a branch: these would show
that receipts and payments do not match and that the trading position is not zero
(in normal circumstances receipts and payments should match and the trading

position should be zero).

I understand from Matthew Lenton (Fujitsu's Post Office Account Document

Manager) that this bug affected thirty branches, resulting in mismatches at twenty,

‘ I understand from Post Office's solicitors that event logs are explained in the first
witness statement of David Malcolm Johnson.

POL00029051
POL00029051
16.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

and that Fujitsu has established this for the purposes of this statement using the
event logs described above.

While the issue at Callendar Square was reported by the Subpostmaster after he
spotted a receipts and payments mismatch, it would have been picked up in any
event by a batch process that is run every night which picked up the mismatch
(this may also be described as a reconciliation process). Each mismatch flagged
would generate a Peak (Peak is browser-based software incident and problem
management system used by Post Office Account which enables details of the
incident and diagnostic progress to be captured in a searchable format and allows
the tracking of problems from detection through to resolution). Fujitsu would then
inform Post Office and provide the information required for Post Office to contact

branches affected by an issue.

USER ERRORS

17.

18.

Mr McLachlan states that for the Misra case he "identified a number of issues that
could give rise to user errors in branch including user interface, screen calibration
and other operating procedures that are attached to the branch terminal, however
the SPM would not necessarily be aware of such errors" (paragraph 17). Mr
McLachlan did not identify any specific cases/branches; these were hypothetical

points.

One of the key design aims of the Horizon user interface was that it would be
easy to use and could be used by those with no IT experience. Appendix B to
{POL-0444058}, which was applicable at the time of Mr McLachlan's report,
shows the design principles followed in deriving the Human Computer Interface
and the design standards applied to keyboard-to-screen mapping, panels and
buttons. Chapters two and three describe the types of screens that make up the
system, their function, layout, characteristics and amounts that can be entered
{POL-0444058}. The screen layout as shown is simple and has three main areas:
navigation buttons at the top; menu buttons in the lower left hand side and a
“stack" area in the lower right hand side. The menu buttons are used to either
select a sub menu or to transact a specific product. The stack area shows what
items the customer has purchased in the current session, with a running total at
the bottom clearly showing what money is owed either to or from the customer.
Adding a value of an item is done using the screen in Figure 3.8, either by using
the numeric keys on the keyboard or by touching the numbers on the screen.
These all appear to me to be industry standard user interfaces and so I do not
know what specific concerns Mr McLachlan had (if any).

POL00029051
19.

20.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

Mr McLachlan refers to the fact that the touch screen had to be re-calibrated from
time to time so that the touch of the user on the screen properly activated the
button under the finger rather than another part of the screen (paragraph 18). He
states that "if the user failed to notice that the screen needed recalibration they
could, for example, touch the image of a button representing [1] and actually
activate the button representing [2]'. As shown at figures 2.1 and 3.8 (Exhibit
TOG2 pages 1 to 2), the buttons on Horizon were large and would need to be
widely out of alignment to give rise to the type of error that Mr McLachlan is
suggesting. In the event that this did happen every touch would be incorrect and
it would be obvious to a user that the wrong button had been pressed. For
example, if the user pressed "cash deposit" but the system registered "cash
withdrawal" the stack would show a "cash withdrawal" and the running total would
show a payment to the customer rather than a payment from the customer. This
is made even more obvious by the payment box on the bottom of the stack going

green (for payment out) rather than red (for payment in).

I understand from Post Office's solicitors that David Malcolm Johnson deals with
how screens are recalibrated and responds to Mr McLachlan's points about the

fast cash button in his second witness statement.

PAPER VOUCHERS

21.

22.

23.

Mr McLachlan states that the branch terminal does not create a paper voucher for
every transaction (paragraph 20). Whilst that is correct, all transactions are
logged and any user with access to Horizon can obtain a report of the
transactions carried out in a branch over a certain period (currently up to 60

days).

I disagree with Mr McLachlan's assertion at paragraph 20 of his statement that
“there were opportunities, even in the branch before the data is transferred out, of
there being issues (Calendar Square being one of them) in relation to which the
system does not provide the ability to reconcile in the branch". The daily cash
declaration and periodic balancing processes are explained in the witness
statement of Post Office's David Malcolm Johnson. Variances can be
investigated using the transaction log, which contains details of all transactions

carried out in a branch over a certain period.

I do not agree with Mr McLachlan's allegation that if a branch produced hard copy
receipts for all transactions as and when done, these would enable
Subpostmasters to check whether the transaction logs are correct or contained
phantom/corrupted transactions. The Subpostmaster is able to print the
transaction log at any time.

POL00029051
POL00029051
24,

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

Further, the Callendar Square issue was identified because the Subpostmaster
spotted a receipts and payments mismatch while balancing a stock unit. Once

spotted, the issue was straightforward to resolve.

PAYMENTS MADE TO INCORRECT CUSTOMER ACCOUNT

25.

26

27.

28.

29.

In paragraph 21 of his statement Mr McLachlan refers to an issue where a branch
would scan an automated payment transaction with a bar code reader for a
customer but when the next customer came to the branch with an automated
payment barcode, the payment the second customer made would go to the
previous client account, with all future customer barcode scanned payments
taken on that particular terminal at that branch defaulting to the first client account
at the time the barcode reader becomes faulty. Professor McLachlan also
concludes that this scenario could result in a shortfall in the branch.

The problem arose from a bug in the interface between Riposte and the barcode
reader which meant that on the rare occasion the previously read barcode was
returned. Where this bug occurred it would not have resulted in a shortfall in the
branch accounts as its effect would be to allocate the funds received by the
branch to a different customer account from the intended one. It would not affect
the amount of cash that that the branch should hold (i.e. there would be no
discrepancy in the branch accounts).

Fujitsu implemented a code change to assist with diagnosing the bug and this
diagnostic code led to an event being raised in the system log (which is visible to
Fujitsu only) so that Fujitsu could investigate with any branch where the issue
occurred. The incidence of this bug was small (Fujitsu was able to check for
instances of the issue by checking for the relevant event in the system log) and it
was not practical to collect sufficient diagnostics to allow Escher to establish the
root cause or to fix it. Rather, the Horizon code was enhanced to provide a
warning message to the user when it detected that a barcode which had been
used recently was being used again. This meant that there was no practical need

to fix the bug.

I understand from Post Office's solicitors that they requested further information
from the Claimants' solicitors to investigate the points made by Professor
McLachlan in paragraphs 16, 21 and 22 of his statement and that no further
information has been provided (Exhibit TOG2 pages 3 to 6). Without it, these
allegations lack any substance and so cannot be dealt with.

I do not intend to respond to paragraphs 23 and 24 of Professor McLachlan's

witness statement as I have already covered the remote alteration of branch

POL00029051
POL00029051
Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

accounts in my first witness statement. However, I have been asked to respond
to paragraphs 9.15 to 9.19 of Mr Coyne's report as regards global branches.

GLOBAL BRANCHES

31.

33.

BUGS

34.1

34.2

34.3

In paragraphs 51 to 56 of my first witness statement I explained that there are two
global branches (which relate to Horizon Online only) that are used solely for
support purposes and that Global users are a category of users that can log on at
any branch (with the exception of users with a role of ADMIN who can only log on

at Global branches).

Mr Coyne refers to a “further global branch recorded as WAKO01 Branch Code
999993" in paragraph 9.17 of his expert report. This branch is no longer used

and was closed in September 2016.

Mr Coyne's allegation at paragraph 9.18 of his expert report that "An instance of a
global branch would allow Fujitsu to create global users and to input transactions
within core Horizon systems as though they had been entered from a physical
branch" is not correct. To enter a transaction for a physical branch would mean

that Fujitsu would have to be physically present at that branch

Similarly with paragraph 9.19 of Mr Coyne's expert report, where Mr Coyne
alleges that "/t is entirely possible that investigation could be further conducted by
Post Office to identify any transactions held within the BRDB containing the
Branch Codes [...]. Such would identify where and what transactions had been
performed by Fujitsu global branches and not a Subpostmaster". This allegation
is meaningless because to enter a transaction a global user has to be physically

present at a branch.

In addition to the Callendar Square issue I have been asked by Post Office to

explain how the following three bugs came to light and were resolved.
the receipts and payments mismatch in September 2010;
the local suspense account issue in 2011; and

an issue which occurred at the Dalmellington branch in October 2015.

Receipts and payments mismatch

35.

At the outset it should be noted that while I understand that this bug has become
known as “the receipts and payments mismatch bug", a receipts and payments

37.

39.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

mismatch is actually a symptom of the issue. As explained above, the bug that
occurred at the Callendar Square also caused a receipts and payments

mismatch, as well as the local suspense account issue which I explain below.

In September 2010 a bug in HNG-X (Horizon Online) caused a receipts and
payments mismatch in some branches. I understand from Gareth Jenkins that
the issue was initially identified as a result of Fujitsu's monitoring of Horizon
Online system events and not as a result of calls from branches. Fujitsu's
Software Support Centre (SSC), which provides 2™ and 3” line support, monitors
system events as a matter of course.

The effect of the issue was that discrepancies declared on Horizon disappeared
from the Horizon counters in some branches when a user followed certain
process steps, but the discrepancies still showed within the back end branch
account (i.e. on POLSAP).’ The issue only occurred if a branch cancelled the
completion of the trading period, but within the same session proceeded to roll
into a new balance period or trading period. This was an unusual sequence of
events.

Each Post Office Branch should roll into a new trading period every four or five
weeks (trading periods are broadly aligned to calendar months so there are forty-
eight four-week and four five-week trading periods each year). When
discrepancies are found when rolling a stock unit over into a new trading period,
the user is asked if the discrepancies should be moved to the local suspense
account. If the user cancelled the rollover at this point (the user was (and is)
offered the option of cancelling) then the discrepancy returns to zero in the local
cache.°

In this case, if the user cancelled the rollover at this point there was no
corresponding double entry transaction generated in the local cache and so the
local cache was in an unbalanced state. At the next screen, the options are to
‘Print’, 'Preview' the trial balance again, re-attempt the rollover or cancel the
rollover. If the rollover was cancelled, then no problem was created. However, if

the rollover was re-attempted at this point by the user, the rollover continued with

? POLSAP is Post Office's back end accounting system.

* The local cache is memory used by the Counter application to handle the rollover. It
holds a summary of all the transactions for the period being rolled over and is used to
generate the opening balance figures for the new balance period and also the reports that
are printed as part of the rollover process.

It is created by obtaining the relevant information from the Branch Database at the start of
the rollover process and is updated as various transactions generated by the rollover
(mainly associated with discrepancies and local suspense) are processed.

the corrupted local cache. This is explained in a Fujitsu document entitled
“Correcting Accounts for "lost" Discrepancies" {POL-0010769}.

This created the following consequences {POL-0010769}:

(a) There was a receipts and payment mismatch corresponding to the value of
discrepancies that were ‘lost’. If the user didn't check their Final Balance
Report carefully, they would be unaware of the issue since there was no
explicit message when a receipts and payment mismatch was found on the
final balance (i.e. when producing the branch trading statement). The user
was only prompted when one was detected during a trial balance.
However, an application event of type 117 was generated in the Horizon
Online system events and so was the system event of type 902 or 903. It
was the monitoring of these events that resulted in the issue first being
identified.

(b) The local suspense will have no record of this specific discrepancy which

should have been transferred to it.

(c) The data used for the Branch Trading Statement would also have a zero
value for discrepancies at the end of the period. When the Branch Trading
Statement is produced this would result in a similar receipts and payment

mismatch.

(d) The level of discrepancies when viewed at the Branch no longer matched
the level as seen in POLSAP or POLMIS.

If the bug was not present, then the discrepancy would have been transferred to
the local suspense account and that would have been cleared by further dialogue
with the Subpostmaster requesting correction of the discrepancies {POL-
0010769}.

The issue affected 60 branches. The affected branches were identified by Fujitsu
searching for the relevant event created by the issue in the Horizon Online
system events. The fact that this issue generated the event types referred to
above means that we can be sure that all instances of the bug were identified by

the events being escalated by the SMC team from the monitoring programme.

The simplest way to correct the issue would have been to introduce the lost
discrepancies in a subsequent period and allow the normal rollover process to
correct it. However, this would have required transactions to be injected into the
system, which was not considered the most appropriate solution by both Fujitsu
and Post Office. Instead, I understand from Gareth Jenkins that adjustments

were made in POLSAP to write off the discrepancies in all the affected branches
(which were still visible to POLSAP) and, if this impacted on the Subpostmaster,
then they were reimbursed. I understand from Gareth that it was not necessary to
correct any branch accounts because once the affected branches had rolled into
a new trading period, the receipts and payments mismatch did not impact on their
accounts.

As explained above, this issue resulted in an error code being generated which
allowed Fujitsu to identify all the branches affected by this problem. Fujitsu
corrected the bug so that discrepancies were no longer lost when the user
selected ‘cancel’ when asked if the discrepancy should be transferred to local
suspense using a code fix. In order to ensure that the problem was fixed correctly,
Fujitsu ran the proposed fix on a test system to ensure the discrepancy was

handled correctly.

As soon as the code fix was implemented and tested it was rolled out to all
branches such that the problem did not re-occur. In the meantime, I understand
from Gareth Jenkins that SSC closely monitored the events generated by the
issue and maintained a spreadsheet of affected branches which was shared with
Product & Branch Accounting (now known as the Finance Service Centre, i.e.
FSC).

Local suspense issue

46.

47.

48.

This bug caused a small number of entries in local suspense accounts from 2010
to be reproduced in the affected branches' local suspense accounts for the same
monthly trading period in 2011 and 2012. This led to Subpostmasters making
good discrepancies again in order to clear their local suspense accounts in 2011
and 2012 despite those entries having already been settled in 2010. In effect,
some branches inadvertently suffered the same loss three times or benefited from

the same gain three times over the course of three years.

The bug was discovered in January 2013 when two Subpostmasters, who
experienced the largest discrepancies, raised the issue with Post Office. I
understand from Gareth Jenkins that Post Office could see the impact of the
problem in their back end system and wrote off the discrepancies experienced by
the branches.

The bug occurred because (as set out in the Gareth Jenkins note at Exhibit TOG2
pages 7 to 12):

Data in the Branch Database is regularly archived/deleted when it is no longer
required. There are different rules for how long different types of data is retained

and when it is deleted.

As a result of some changes that were made on 3 July 2011 to the Horizon
archiving strategy relating to Stock Units that had been deleted in a branch, any
branch that deleted a Stock Unit at the end of 2010 which had a local suspense
transaction in that Stock Unit before it was deleted were left in the table used for
constructing the branch trading statement. This meant that as trading periods
cycle around each year, these branch trading statement records became visible in
2011 when the same trading period was reached.

The effect of these old records was that as far as the system was concerned the
affected branches’ local suspense accounts included the amounts carried over
from the previous year. These orphaned records were created between 16
November 2010 and 9 December 2010.

When the trading period was balanced this would result in the total value for local
suspense being calculated incorrectly and the Subpostmaster being asked to
make good an incorrect amount. It is at this point that transactions would be
generated into the audit trail reflecting the fact that the Subpostmaster had
cleared the local suspense account for an incorrect amount (Exhibit TOG2 pages
T to 12).

At the equivalent trading periods in 2012 and 2013, the problem re-occurred and
one of the affected branches reported the problem to Fujitsu on 25 February 2013
(Peak PC0223870) resulting in a detailed analysis of this issue and finding the
orphaned branch trading statement records. The root cause was determined by
28 February 2013 and a preliminary report was sent to Post Office. A further
update was sent on 14 March 2013 with a full analysis of the issue and all the
affected branches (Exhibit TOG2 pages 7 to 12).

When the problem was investigated in 2013, 14 branches were identified that had
such historical records in the table used to generate the branch trading statement
report (which was the root cause of the problem) (Exhibit TOG2 pages 7 to 12).
Five of the affected branches had experienced losses, seven had experienced
gains and two had experienced both a loss and a gain. One loss was for £9,800,
one gain was for £3,100 and the rest were less than £161 (Exhibit TOG2 pages 7
to 12).

The old records that caused the issue were deleted so that they would not cause

a further issue in future years.

Also further checks during the balancing process were introduced to identify any
occurrence of this situation so that alerts would be raised to indicate to support
staff that a situation that should never occur has occurred and thus trigger
immediate investigation. These changes were progressed through the normal
support route for a maintenance release of the Horizon counter code (Exhibit
TOG2 pages 7 to 12).

I understand from Gareth Jenkins that no changes needed to be made to the

audit logging process, which worked as designed.

In order to explain this scenario it is useful to set out the role of Horizon Online in
managing the movement of cash between core and outreach branches. Outreach
branches are typically small part-time branches using a village hall or a mobile
van which enable services to continue to be provided to communities which would
not otherwise receive them. A Subpostmaster who operates a core branch and an
outreach branch requires the ability to record the fact that a pouch has been
prepared and remitted out of one branch and to record that a pouch has been
received and remitted into another branch. I understand from Gareth Jenkins that
from a Horizon perspective, the remittance out and the remittance in are
independent transactions and they are reported through to Post Office systems
which are able to reconcile the remittances.

Dalmellington Post Office operated outreach services at Bellsbank and

Carsphairn. Dalmellington was the core branch.

I understand from Gareth Jenkins that cash deliveries were received at the core
branch and then cash was transferred to the outreach services via a ‘branch to
branch’ remittance. This involved the scanning of a bar code to transfer the cash

onto Horizon from the core branch to the outreach services

I understand from Gareth Jenkins that on 8 October 2015 the Subpostmaster
undertook a transfer of £8,000 to her outreach services by scanning a bar code.
The Subpostmaster asserted that:-

when she accepted this into her outreach branch, the transfer replicated four
times for which she had Horizon receipts totalling £32,000.00; and

the core office was not showing a discrepancy, but the outreach service was

showing a discrepancy of £24,000.00.

The issue was investigated SSC who established that:-

the user logged into stock unit AA of the outreach branch which required an
immediate cash declaration (as part of the business process);

stock unit AA timed out and logged off due to inactivity;

the user logged back into stock unit AA later and undertook the remittance
delivery transaction (pouch delivery, manual transaction). Two delivery receipts
were printed, the user pressed ‘Enter’ and a "Rem In" slip was printed by Horizon.
At that point Horizon should have displayed the 'Remittances & Transfers Home’
screen, but the Pouch Delivery screen was still showing, with ‘Enter’ enabled.

Pressing ‘Enter’ again repeated the remittance in and further receipts printed;

the user pressed ‘Enter’ four times, instead of the required once, and
subsequently the amount of £32,000.00 was entered into Horizon instead of
£8,000.00, the actual amount of cash that had been remitted out of the core

branch;

each of these actions was visible to the user with separate receipts being printed
for each transaction. They were also listed in the transaction log reports available
to the user. The multiple remittances created by the Subpostmaster were easily
recognisable as such in transaction logs and Horizon’s integrity was maintained —

all the events were captured accurately and separately within the system;

The issue was resolved by the issuing of a transaction correction on 27 October
2015 for £24,000.00, prior to the completion of the Branch Trading Statement on
29 October 2015.

This issue only had the potential to affect Subpostmasters operating the Core and
Outreach model. SSC reviewed logs to identify where this or similar scenarios
could have occurred identifying pouch barcodes which have been remitted in
more than once. In total 112 instances of ‘duplicate barcodes’ were identified to
have occurred since the introduction of Horizon Online (the issue did not affect
Legacy Horizon). I understand from Gareth Jenkins that Fujitsu's analysis was
shared with Post Office to enable Post Office to issue Transaction Corrections or
advise Subpostmasters how to take corrective action (Exhibit TOG2 pages 13 to
27).

PARAGRAPHS 5.156 TO 5.159 OF JASON COYNE'S REPORT

62.

At paragraphs 5.156 to 5.159 of Mr Coyne's report, Mr Coyne refers to the Post
Office Account Customer Service Problem Management Procedure document
which specifies certain key performance indicators with regard to Problem
Management. Problem Management is described in {POL-0152874} as “The aim

of Problem Management is to investigate, eliminate or prevent causes of
Incidents and Known Errors regarding POA & POL Infrastructure/information
System and to prevent the recurrence of Incidents related to these errors. To
achieve this aim, Problem Management seeks to establish the Root Cause of

Incidents and then start actions to improve or correct the situation”.

I have spoken to my colleague Steve Bansal, Fujitsu's Senior Service Delivery
Manager, who has informed me that the Post Office Account Customer Service
Problem Management Procedure document was introduced by Saheed Salawu,
Fujitsu's former Horizon Lead Service Delivery Manager and that Saheed Salawu
left the Fujitsu Post Office Account in around February 2013, before the new
procedure had been implemented. I understand from Steve that Saheed
Salawu's replacement did not wish to implement the changes and therefore the
records referred to by Mr Coyne in paragraphs 5.157 to 5.159 of his report do not
exist, as we continued to follow the previous existing reporting methodology.

When Legacy Horizon was in place Problem Management was reported in a
specific section within the Service Review Book (SRB). The Service Review
Book was “the primary input into the Service Management Forum reporting on
performance against SLT’s” {POL-0106087}.

From September 2010 these SRBs reported metrics only against contractual
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and as there are no contractual SLAs for
Problem Management, it is not covered in the SRB reports between September
2010 and 2014

For the years 2014 to 2017 there are annual Problem Review reports {POL-
0143345, POL-0146645; POL-0151871} and Exhibit TOS2 (pages 28 to 50).

Further, the interface between Fujitsu / POL / Atos is described in {POL-
0146857}. The Problem Management Operational Review Forum is described at
section 10.1. The forum meets at either fortnightly or monthly intervals, originally
with POL, then with Atos, and now with Atos and POL. The meetings are
documented via the Problem Review Tracker (which is maintained and shared
with Atos weekly).

When a new live incident is generated via the Major Account Control team (MAC)
or SMC team a check is made for an existing applicable KEL, that KEL reference
being added to the incident. If there isn’t an existing KEL that applies, then for
significant incidents, a new one will be raised following incident resolution {POL-
0444057} and (Exhibit TOG2 pages 51 to 52).

PARAGRAPH 2.5 C) OF THE WITNESS STATEMENT OF IAN RUTHERFORD
HENDERSON

69.

At paragraph 2.5 c) of his witness statement, lan Henderson explains that he was
concerned with "/gJaps in the numeric sequence of transactions". I understand
that Mr Henderson is referring to Journal Sequence Numbers (JSN) and Session
Sequence Numbers (SSN) here. I have spoken to Jason Muir, Operational
Security Manager at Fujitsu and I understand that:

A JSN is "a unique number used by a counter in a given branch which can be
used to identify the audit data. JSNs are always increasing but should not have
gaps in their sequence" {POL-0148800}. JSNs are used for many on-line requests
other than basket settlements (for example, a password change, log on, or
anything that requires auditing when going to the data centre from the Counter).

An SSN is "a unique number used by a counter in a given branch which can be
used to identify a Basket (or session)" {POL-0148800}. The SSN is calculated as
the last 6 digits of the JSN at the start of the basket; being 6 digits they will wrap
around from 999999 to 000000. They may be reused (but not for at least 7
years).

It follows that if a JSN is allocated for a purpose other than the start of a basket,
between the start of one basket and the start of the subsequent basket then there
will be a gap in the SSN sequence but nevertheless a full sequence of JSN.
