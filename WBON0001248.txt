I think we should flag to BEIS/UKGI in advance given the possibility (even if remote) of this being picked
up by the press.

Equally we should flag to GE, the Board and the auditors. I’ll draft a note and circulate shortly for comment.

Thanks Andy — I am not sure, I will pick this up with Jane on Monday, as I am on leave tomorrow. I note the
following sentence may indicate that we don’t and provide insight into what appears to be a rather crude
tactic ahead of Tuesday:

should be relied upon solely as a suitable guide for the purposes of proportionality considerations in costs budgeting.

126896945]

All

Please find attached each parties' skeleton arguments for the CMC next week. Most of this was expected. There was
one surprising paragraph in the Claimant's skeleton:

39. The likely aggregate value of the case is estimated to be of the order of £80 to £90 million (or in excess thereof,
subject to further quantum analysis and formulation).s1 The Claimants have not been directed to produce detailed
schedules of loss, though the Schedules of Information contain detailed information on relevant heads of loss. The
range given here derives from the Claimants’ solicitors’ analysis of the information contained in the Schedules of
Information. By its nature, it is an estimate based upon present information. There are inherent difficulties to setting
out the quantum of these claims at this stagessand the figures should be relied upon solely as a suitable guide for the
purposes of proportionality considerations in costs budgeting.

This is the first time that we have had any aggregated claim valuation (and this is much lower than the total of their
SOls).

A few thoughts:

Mel — just FYI in case this is reported in the press.
Rod — do you need to tell UKGI about this?

Mark — do we need to tell the auditors?

Kind regards
Andy
