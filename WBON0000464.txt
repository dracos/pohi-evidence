Jane

Understood. I didn't realise a new policy had been adopted in January so, as you say, this is irrelevant and does not
need to be disclosed to Freeths. We may however need to disclose the previous version that would be applicable to
some of the Claimants. Amy (BD) will speak to Amy (POL) to determine what these docs are and then we can take a
view on whether to disclose them.

Kind regards

Andy

Amy Prime has been in touch with Amy Quirk regarding our prosecutions policy. Attached is the version
which was approved by the POL Board in January this year. We are also in the process of finalising an
Investigations Policy. Neither of these is relevant to any of the claims being dealt with by Freeths, as they

post-date those claims, so I would be reluctant for either of these to be disclosed to Freeths without further
discussion.

Kind regards,

Hi Jane,

Sorry about this. The request regarding our internal prosecution policy relates to the below. Amy is aware we
follow the CPIA guidelines in respect of investigation and that full code test review is applied to any case
file seeking to be submitted via ERO prior to it coming to you for consideration as to charge decision /
summoms. However, as part of the horizon piece she asked for a copy of the internal prosecution policy
document. I am assured these will not be sent anywhere externally without your sign off and the requirement
is part of bond dickinson support of the Post Office and not as a request from any other source.

Sincerely Amy

Hi Amy

Thank you for following this up.

For your information, we are aiming to provide the disclosure documents to Freeths by the end of this week. So as
to allow us time to review the Investigation guidelines and consider / discuss with you whether these should be
disclosed to Freeths, it would be appreciated if we could be provided with them by tomorrow evening.

Kind regards

Amy

Hi Amy,

There is an internal prosecutions policy this runs in line with CPIA and CPS best practise in respect of ERO
decisions/ full code test etc.

I will give you a call.

Dear Amy

Tam assisting Andy Parsons with the Horizon dispute.

Further to your previous discussions in relation to the disclosure of Post Office's investigation guidelines to
the Claimants' solicitors (please see the attached emails for your reference), I understand that rather than
there being internal Post Office investigations guidelines you instead follow the CPIA and CPS best
practise.

The Claimants' solicitors have requested additional information in relation to any investigation guidelines
and, so as we can ensure that we provide the correct response and documentation, it would be appreciated if
you could confirm which best practise documents are followed (please could you provide a copy of these or
a link to them online) and confirm that Post Office does not currently have / follow internal investigation
guidelines.

If it would be easier to discuss the above please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards

Amy
