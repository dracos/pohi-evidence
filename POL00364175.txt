Attachment: _DOC_154958621(1)_15th Witness Statement of Parsons - Recusal.DOCX
All

As per my discussion earlier today with Gideon, we have added more sections of the Judgment to the attached
statement. Our approach has been to include anything that we might rely on, unless plainly not relevant to the
application. The objective being to avoid any challenge on appeal that a point in the Judgment was not put to Fraser
on the application.

All comments welcomed.

Kind regards
Andy

Hi Gideon, Stephanie

Please could you let me know an ETA for the witness statement being circulated — not chasing, just planning
diaries.
