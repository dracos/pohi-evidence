CAPS and Card Programme Board Action Notes

10 July 1998, Terminal House, London

Issue 5 (Horizon only)

Altending: George McCorkell (Chair), Dave Miller, Vince Gaskell, Peter Crahan, John
Delamore, Ken Davenport, Frances O'Connell, Val Curran, Tim Cutts.

Apologies: Alexis Cleveland, John Codling, Lis Astall

1. Live Operations

1.1 Dave Miller opened his report to the Board with an update on the ‘Lost transactions' issue.
Extrapolation of the current losses to final volumes would represent £1.5m / month.
Investigations are on-going, but the prevailing view from Pathway is that some form of
user error is associated with the majority of the lost transactions. However, Horizon
believe that the system design should be such that it will preclude or eliminate the scope
for user errors of this type. Horizon are continuing to work with Pathway, to eliminate the
causes of such errors at source. Dave Miller confirmed that the lessons learned from the
identification of the causes of these ‘lost transactions' will be fed into future Model Office
testing.

1.2 Peter Crahan suggested that it may be an appropriate time to conduct a thorough review
of service management, a view which was supported by Dave Miller.

AP 5.1 (H)
Dave Miller / Peter Crahan to discuss the establishment of a working group to
conduct an end to end review of service management.

1.3 Vince Gaskell raised the issue of the Sequent Box failure discussed earlier in the CAPS
and Card Programme Managers report to the Board and enquired if a post incident review
had been conducted. Dave Miller undertook to investigate the current position and advise
accordingly

AP 5.2 (H)

Replanning and Acceptance

Dave Miller advised that the sponsors were continuing to work together on delivering a
workable plan. A checkpoint meeting was planned for 14 July 1998 where discussions
would be held with Mike Coombes (of ICL Pathway).

John Meagher has been appointed to take forward Acceptance on behalf of Horizon.

Additional staff will be recruited to assist in this task. Peter Crahan advised that Paul
Wooton (on behalf of CAPS) would make early contact with a view to achieving an

agreed Acceptance process by the end of July 1998.

Risks and Issues

Dave Miller reiterated the risks and issues contained in his report to the Board.
Reference data;

- a team was to be established within Horizon to focus on finalising the outstanding
requirements for Reference data.

High Level Test Plan/scripts & draft test plan from CAPS re PACS;

- Vince Gaskell pointed out that to date, CAPS had delivered all the required products in
accordance with plans provided from CAPS. The items highlighted were on the plan but
were not yet due to be delivered. He also indicated that an equivalent management plan
had not yet been received from Pathway or Horizon

Future releases

George McCorkell highlighted current concems over the absence of realistic timing for
Release 2+. Dave Miller acknowledged these concems and undertook to communicate
them at future meetings with ICL Pathway.

Contractual issues

Peter Crahan raised the number of outstanding CRs that had been on-going for some
time. He agreed with Dave Miller that they would meet to discuss how to progress
longstanding CRs.

AP 5.3 (A)
Peter Crahan / Dave Miller to meet to discuss longstanding CRs.

Horizon Action Point updates
AP 3.1(H) - it was agreed that the note provided from Andrew Simpkins and continuing
work on the replan would effectively clear this action point. AP cleared.

AP 3.3(H) - the meeting was advised that contrary to information previously provided,
the Product Assurance forum, together with the other fora would be initiated. CAPS

the Programme Board is reinforced and formalised. Peter Crahan and Dave Miller agreed
that a final PDA transition board should take piace which would confirm that the fora are
in place and operating. AP cleared
