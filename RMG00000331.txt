Royal Mail Group Board Governance Questionnaire 2012

This report summarises responses to face-to-face interviews and a two-part questionnaire on the
operation and governance of the Royal Mail Board. All Board Directors were interviewed and all
completed the questionnaire. The interviews were broad ranging and help to provide context for
the questionnaire responses.

The questionnaire has 2 parts:

Part 1 comprises 11 distinct sections and a total of 76 questions on a 1-7 scale, where 1 indicates
dissatisfaction and 7 indicates satisfaction. In addition, respondents are given the opportunity to
write comments under each section.

Part 2 asks respondents to assess the level of Board engagement at Royal Mail for six business
activities, indicating both their rating for current engagement and desired engagement.

Here, we report on both the quantitative data from the scaled questions and the qualitative data
from the written observations and interviews.

We show, where appropriate, the overall means for individual questions taken from the databank of
a wider sample of Boards drawn mainly from the FTSE 100, but also including not-for-profit and
some enterprises based outside the UK. The databank therefore does not constitute a directly
comparable or random sample, but is included for illustrative purposes and to show where there
may be patterns in high and low scores on other Board surveys using similar questions

Appendix 1 shows questionnaire results by rank order. Appendix 2 shows wider databank means by
rank order. Appendix 3 shows the gap between Royal Mail and the wider databank means.
Appendix 4 shows the distribution of responses for each Board member across the 76 scaled
questions in Part 1. Appendix 5 shows the gap between Royal Mail 2009 & 2012 Mean Scores,
Appendix 6 shows a bar chart comparison for section Mean Score between Royal Mail 2009 & 2012
and Appendix 7 shows bar chart comparisons of mean scores for the Board, Executive Directors,
Non-Executive Directors and the wider databank.

Questionnaire responses

Overall, the results show that Board members express satisfaction with various aspects of Board
governance and functioning. In Part 1 53% of questions are at and above the mean from the wider
databank and 67% have a rating of 5.5 or above on a seven point scale. 52% of questions score the
same as or higher than the 2009 Board assessment results.

Particular strengths are:

* Board leadership and culture (qs 49-56)
* Audit and Risk Committee (qs 57-63)
* Corporate governance (qs 24, 16, 50)

Also strong - by comparison to wider norms and/or the previous 2009 assessment - are:

* — Utilisation of directors’ experience (q 3)
* Agenda focus on relevant issues (q 11)

But data from Part 1 also suggest areas for improvement which include:

* Resourcing, remit and operation of the Remuneration Committee (qs 70-76)
* — Structure and membership of Board committees (q 8)
* Number and length of meetings (qs 6, 7)

In addition, some commentary and questionnaire responses indicate concerns around:

* Setting of performance objectives (q 43); monitoring of performance (qs 44, 47)
* ~ Quality/quantity of information flows (qs 34, 35)

In Part 2 responses show a Board which could be more engaged in several priority areas, in
particular:

* Innovation and new products; and strategy for growth
* Customer focus

Interview responses

Context and recent history

Interviews enabled discussion of issues free from the constraints of the questionnaire design, while
at the same time giving opportunity to comment on key themes emerging from the pattern of
questionnaire responses.

Board members stress the unique context of the RM Board — in relation to the shareholder
relationship; demanding market conditions; pace of technological change; mix and scale of
operations and so on. These comments mirror those expressed in the 2009 Board assessment. As
before, they describe a context of considerable complexity.

Since 2009 the Board has been in a period of transition. One NED joined as the last assessment was
completed - three more NEDs arrived during 2010. A new CEO and CFO were appointed in the same
year.

Given the diverse backgrounds of those simultaneously appointed to the Board, directors describe a
period of learning and adjustment. At the same time, they recall Board focus on short-term survival
—with a constant check on whether Royal Mail could be regarded as “a going concern”.

Recent developments in relation to pension plan liabilities; balance sheet restructuring and a new
regulatory framework are seen to have resolved many questions about the financial health of RM.

With a more settled Board - and short-term challenges addressed - the focus turns to preparation for
privatisation. How well set is the Board - and the business - for a transaction likely to take place
within the next 18 months?

Board members describe a “highly charged” atmosphere; events unfolding at “breakneck” speed; a
business even more “in the spotlight”; increasing work pressures; and a set of potentially “career
defining” business challenges.

How, then, can the Board equip itself to actively shape this new agenda?

Board capabilities

The interviews indicate a Board more confident in its capabilities — and confirm many of the positive
questionnaire responses. In particular:

* The Board is perceived as substantially strengthened by its newer members (both NEDs and
EDs).

* NEDs are seen to bring appropriate experience/expertise relating to, for example,
government/regulatory environment; public utility privatisation; marketing/customer insight
and so on

* NEDs are seen as more aligned and knowledgeable; better able to understand the business;
more engaged and demanding; more aware of their respective roles — and, as a result, more
respected by the EDs

RMG00000331
RMG00000331

Royal Mail Group Board Governance Questionnaire 2012

* Internal dynamics and key relationships appear to be excellent; culture and teamwork are
strong

* ~The Chairman is universally praised — typical comments include: “clear on priorities but
enables discussion”; “strong but listens”; “supportive”; “excellent mentor for newcomers”;
“handles complexity’; “appropriate skill set for transaction”.

* The CEO is also described in very positive terms: “a force of nature”; “hands on”;
“energetic”; “challenging” “a powerful communicator of our case — to the shareholder, and
the regulator”; “successfully engaged with the unions and staff”.

* The Chairman-CEO relationship is seen as strong and well place to handle anticipated
challenges

* Audit and Remuneration Committees are regarded as well led

* Board agendas are appropriately focused and, in the main, business effectively dispatched

On all these important dimensions - relating to membership, priorities and dynamics - the Board
compares well with others and seems set to handle RM’s anticipated transition.

Areas for improvement
This is not to say that members did not express concerns — for example, around:

* Shared understanding of “operations”; the challenges of modernisation; and the “people
factor”

* The extent to which EDs constructively invite help from NEDs

* The need for newer NEDs to continue their learning

* The appropriate and timely provision of information (in a fast changing context)

* Political tensions surrounding the operation of the Remuneration Committee and related
retention issues

More broadly, several express the view that whilst the Board appears strong on many dimensions,
the business remains “at risk”. Consequently questions are raised about shaping the organisation
and maximising performance in the run up to the anticipated transaction in ways which can produce
a successful outcome (whatever this may look like). How can the Board facilitate:

* Development and communication of a strong growth story/strategy

* Capability to execute or deliver a growth strategy

* Greater customer focus and insight

* Development of change management/transformation/IT capability

* Robust management structures; metrics and information flows

* Greater awareness of the levers that can be pulled (and those that cannot)

Next steps

The areas for improvement that emerge from the questionnaire and interviews are likely to be
interconnected not discrete. Further, the weight attached to each varies by Board member.

RMG00000331
RMG00000331

Royal Mail Group Board Governance Questionnaire 2012

When asked to consider positive outcomes from this assessment directors’ responses fall broadly
into two sets.

One favours an early and explicit “airing” of any differences amongst directors on the business risk
factors referred to above - as a step towards building agreement on how to address them.

The other focuses more on fine tuning what might be called Board mechanics — for example, number
of meetings and their length; Committee membership; operation of the Remuneration Committee;
and length and quality of Board papers.

These two sets are not mutually exclusive. Together with some of the more detailed observations
emerging from the questionnaire they might form the start point for further Board discussion.

(Note Mean Board score for 2009 is included below the 2012 score in brackets throughout)

The mean score for this section comprising eight items is 5.5 out of a possible 7.

* Utilisation of Directors’ experience (q 3) has improved since 2009

* But other scores have fallen and compare unfavourably with the wider mean- in particular
those relating to committee structure (q8) and the number and length of meetings (qs 7 and

8)

* Several comments relate to meeting length and to Committee membership

Comments from questionnaire

NED

1 With regard to the structure of committees, I don’t believe that the present ‘all in’ approach is
incorrect, but I think the proposal to review this is the right one even if we decide to stay as is.

2 I These comments obviously relate to the current governance obligations. The governance
challenge will become more complicated and onerous post transaction, and particularly if
listed. The Board should start to think about the implications.

3 I Some Board meetings are too long

4 — All NEDs sit on the Rem Committee and the Audit Committee thus defeating one of the
purposes of having Board Committees. I would prefer a conventional approach where
committee membership is a subset of NEDs with appropriate and relevant experience

5 I Question 7 is unhelpfully worded. My view is that we meet too infrequently, given the range
of issues that we are facing, and that the meetings are too long as a consequence. But saying
that the length of meetings is inadequate doesn’t convey the latter point. In response to
question 5, I am not aware of a written statement of expectations of Directors, but I do not
particularly think this is a problem

6 I The meetings are often too long. This may be because we are trying to cover too much with
too few meetings.

ED

8 I Ihave marked 4 where I am not aware whether this is an accurate statement or not

9 I 1. We need clarification of mandate of RemCo

Comments from questionnaire

NED

a. Believe more time should be spent on bigger picture strategic issues, customer trends and
revenue development. Should consider weaving these in more to Board meetings...perhaps
quarterly than a one off event in the summer

2 An attempt has been made to cover the groups’ principal risks during the Board cycle, by
using the lens of real business issues. Whilst the intention is good, the execution has not been
as systematic as I would like.

3 Broadly the Board works well and there has been increased focus on what matters

5 The process of setting the agenda is opaque to me - I assume it happens between the
Chairman and the executive. However, I have no problem with that. The Chairman quite
effectively picks up on issues that arise in the meetings, and suggests issues that need
consideration at future meetings. And if there is an issue that I want discussed, I can easily
raise it with the Chairman and he is responsive.

6 See above. Board meetings could be even more productive if pace is kept up, with tighter
chairing.
ED
8 As an Executive it is easier to judge but the Chairman is very active in defining what is to come

to the Board and getting balance

9 9. We do the best we can. Sometimes things come up requiring discussion without prior
notification.

2 Having all Directors sit on all committees has its merits, but does provide an opportunity for
some to ‘sit back’ rather than forward. This increases the burden on committee Chairs.
3 Consideration is being given to a Finance Committee which may prove very helpful in any run-
up to an IPO
4 Too many Executive Directors — should be restricted to CEO and CFO although recognise the
difficulty of changing at the moment - Comment on committees as above

NED

1 Don’t believe that the criteria for NEDs has ever been written down or articulated. Not been
party to a discussion about make-up, overlaps, gaps etc.

2 Continuous professional development is encouraged, but no idea if colleagues make the effort
- maybe it should also be reported on

3 Diaries are a problem; with a Group like RM there is a need for more flexibility. The Group
should diarise 2012 and 2013 meetings as soon as possible.

5 Diary management is always a problem with busy people. And there has recently been a
tendency to move meetings around late in the day, which wherever possible should be
avoided.

a. There is no deep customer experience represented at Executive level. Could also combine
with greater digital experience.

2 I have a generally high regard for the capability and performance of the executive team. But
Royal Mail is a difficult environment for word class talent to thrive in — mainly because of
shareholder limitations. The Board needs to monitor closely the stability of the executive
team in light of this.

3 Small number of Exec Directors is appropriate

4 The Exec Directors act as a team when in the presence of the NEDs. Hard to tell if they act as a

team outside that environment although no evidence to suggest that they don’t. The CEO is a
dominant personality.

NED

2 The Board is an effective forum for proactive strategic leadership, but our role in terms of
performance setting is much more reactive. I don’t believe that we are close enough to
the business drivers to challenge management's performance expectations. The group
almost feels like a super tanker — set on a certain path and very difficult to manoeuvre.
Also, performance has to date been dominated by cash metrics and quality of service
metrics. If the group is listed, notions of ‘return’ will become critical and there is no DNA
in this area.

3 Communication with shareholder is largely through Chairman; recent dinner was helpful

5 My scoring here reflects two things. First, although we have clear targets, the process of

Second, we have had one very serious failure of management and internal audit controls
which was very concerning — are there other instances of which we are unaware

Board Leadership and Culture

The mean score for this section comprising eight items is 6.1 out of a possible 7.

All but one question (q56) score higher than the wider mean databank.

Board leadership (q 49), Chairman/CEO role differentiation (q 50), teamwork/constructive
relations (qs 52, 55), participation (q 53) and open communication (q 54) are scored strongly
Some scores and comments suggest that meeting management and succession planning are
areas for possible improvement

3 Succession planning for NED’s has been unnecessary as Board stability is viewed as
important pre IPO
5 I think that the Board meetings are not managed as well as they could be. There is a
tendency for long presentations on occasions from the executive, going through papers
that we have read, and the discussion can be allowed to go on too long. But this s a minor
criticism — generally Board meetings are very effective.

1 Would like to see this Committee complimented by a strategic discussion about talent
and the performance/potential of key executives.

2 The NomCo has not really had to work in ‘anger’, so its difficult to judge its effectiveness

3 Not a year for much NomCom activity

4 Not sure whether there is a separate Nominations Committee. If there is I don’t believe it
has met this year therefore no ratings given

5 I haven't felt able to comment on this because I think Nominations Committee has

operated rather informally — see my comments above on the appointment of non-execs

Remuneration Committee

The mean score for this section comprising seven items is 4.8 out of a possible 7.

This section receives the lowest overall mean score.
Although the leadership of the committee is positively assessed — with an improved score

from 2009 — the resources and information provided to the committee are seen as
inadequate (qs 75, 76) and this produces the lowest scores in the entire assessment.

Comments echo these concerns and raise issues relating to terms of reference, management

2 Poor staff work and incomplete papers complicate the RemCo job. The rem consultant
seems ok, but management is weak. It’s also unclear how deep and in what areas RemCo
needs to get involved beyond Exec Directors.

3 As with the ARC, RemCo could have fewer members, provided attendance is guaranteed.
Astep change is required in the operation of the Committee. This will start with new
Terms of Reference.

4 There are too many committee meetings. Remuneration is politically sensitive but I have
rarely known a company have as many rem committee meetings as we do. The quality of
information coming from the HR function to the committee is of variable quality to put it
politely.

5 RemCo is one part of the machinery which does not work at all well, mainly because it is
very badly served by the HR Director, and despite having a very good chairman. This is an
issue that needs to be sorted urgently.

Analysis of Board Responses to Part 2 of the Questionnaire:
Board Priority Tasks

* There are substantial spreads in responses on several Board priority tasks

* Although improvement is desired across all areas, current and desired engagement levels
are closest for modernisation of core activities and government relationship

* Greatest scope for improvement is in the area of innovation and new products and strategy
for growth; and in customer focus

* EDs appear more satisfied with engagement levels on modernisation and differ significantly
from NEDs on the need for greater customer focus (they want less). By contrast, they
express a stronger desire for exposure to executive management
