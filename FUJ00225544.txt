Subject: Witness statement - South Warnborough

Andy
I've made 1 or 2 minor amendments ........... put all the text into the same font, spelling of South Warnborough and also
put (7???) following some acronyms so can you explain in full .........0.... (i know some are explained later in the

statement but to make things easier for a barrister & jury any acronyms should be explained the 1st time they appear in a
statement). Most of the explanations of the calls make sense to me aside the one below and which appears to suggest a
fault . can you simplify what this one means ?

Wed 21 April 2004 23:17 Call Reference E- 0404211106 — New call taken by Richard Postance: Critical NT (??)_Error
occurred at 23:02:11, 21/04/04 on H09290400101. 'the device \device\scsiportn did not respond within the timeout
period’. Resolution: An automatic error event was picked up by the SMC (System Management Centre) [2nd line
support] and a call was logged.

The SMC referred to KEL (Known Error Log) database ref: rcoleman1253J and PCarroll909Z. A remote reboot of the
counter was carried out, which did not resolve problem.: An 'A' Priority call raised E-0404220123 to contact and advise
PM for manual reboot. Call Closed by Kevin Pearson 22/04/2004 09:48

Here's my updated statement,
(See attached file: WS South Warnboro 092904 updated (call logs AD).doc)

once you have amended can you please post direct to Graham Brander:

Address

Cheers
