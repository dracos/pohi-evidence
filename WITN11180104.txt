Mr Elliot Jacobs

8 February 2024

Dear Mr Jacobs,

As you are aware, the Assurance & Complex Investigation (A&CI) team (formally known as the Central
Investigations Unit) at Post Office Limited (POL) conducted a fact-finding investigation with your
assistance. I am writing to you to inform you that this matter is closed from the perspective of A&CI.

The matters centred on two main themes:

1. Did you, in your capacity as a Non-Executive Director of POL, make false or misleading or
incomplete declarations on a ‘Renumeration form for Directors and Other Key Management
Personnel’ completed by you on or about 22 June 2022.

2. Did you, through your ownership of UOE, fail to address or service a shortfall debt owed to POL
accrued by UOE.

In respect of the first matter, our findings are that the training and advice you were provided in relation
to the completion of this declaration was such that it was unreasonable for you to know whether your
financial position with POL should or should not have been declared. Therefore, A&CI has
recommended that this matter should not be taken further. We have also recommended to the
Corporate Secretariate that the instructions, training, and advice to future potential Directors is
improved in respect to this declaration. This has been logged with Group Assurance for them to monitor
the changes in approach.

In respect of the second matter, I understand that you have for some time now been liaising directly
with Central Operations Director, Melanie Park, to address the shortfalls at your branches and to reach
a mutually agreed outcome. Now that this arrangement has been agreed, A&CI can close the fact-
finding investigation.

I can, therefore, confirm that our fact-find in relation to these matters is now closed. I would like to
take this opportunity to thank you for your patience, and cooperation in this matter.
Yours sincerely,

John Bartlett
Head of Assurance & Complex Investigations
