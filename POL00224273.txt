Hi Kevin
It was just the note below;

We wanted to update you on media coverage around Sparrow.

As you know, we published our report on Tuesday. There was a very
limited media reaction.

Yesterday, James Arbuthnot MP raised the issue in Prime Minister's
Questions. He accused us of sacking Second Sight and destroying
evidence. David Cameron was well briefed and responded in a helpful
way.

This prompted some media activity but I am glad to say it was confined
to BBC Radio Five Live and even then outside prime time. There was no
TV coverage or focus on any of the flagship outlets and nothing in the
newspapers this morning.

We engaged robustly at senior levels in the BBC to support our strategy
of minimising media attention and, therefore, potential brand damage.

This will return when Second Sight's report is leaked, as it surely will be,
and if the Select Committee reports. We are engaging with Select
Committee members to impress upon them that this is more complex
than some would suggest.

We will keep you updated.
