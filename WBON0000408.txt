The POL board has approved today a way forward on Project Sparrow. In short, the plan is:
. Post Office adopt a presumption in favour of mediating all non-criminal cases within the

Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme;
. the Working Group overseeing the Scheme role ceases and is closed; and
. the current engagement with Second Sight be terminated.

I've attached the Board and ExCo papers â€” please do not forward to anyone else (POL are keeping this decision
extremely confidential for now).
