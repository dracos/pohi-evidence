Agree, the 1,548 is manageable — please can you liaise with Joel and Beth in the Southampton office (cc'ed) to review

these documents. I want to keep Plymouth clear for the email accounts.

They will need a full briefing on the scope of documents which need to be disclosed, including the requirement to
disclose all adverse documents we come across. I think we adopt the same approach as the previous board minutes
(ie. redact everything which is not relevant).

Thanks

Thanks for the update Amy.

We are now in the process of extracting and imaging this data ahead of processing.

I see that we have a total of 84 files, amounting to less than 5GB, uploaded to folders GE Documents and
Board Papers.

This puts the estimated processing cost at £400. However, a number of the files are zipped and so the final
data size/processing cost is likely to increase.

Should this data be de-duplicated against the existing document pool (including nearline archived items) or
only within itself (or not at all)?

Kind regards

Hi Dan

I don't know what happened with the hard drive (user error probably) but the encryption process didn't speed up and it
seemed to want to encrypt itself before any data had been put on it. I will send the hard drive back to you. The
documents have instead been uploaded to the FTP.

Please could you process into Relativity the documents in the folders named:
Board Papers (20 June 18 Extraction)

GE Documents (extracted 20 June 2018)

Could the documents please be kept into two separate folders in Relativity, one named Board Papers and the other
named GE Papers.

Many thanks

Morning Dan

Is it possible to try a remote forensic extraction of the POL documents today? I am meeting with the custodian at
11am and if this doesn't work then we can just drag and drop the documents. No worries if not but thought it might be
worth a try.

Many thanks
