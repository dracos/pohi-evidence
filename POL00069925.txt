I had a telephone conversation with Mared Hughes of Hugh James in relation to the ???. She
updated me as follows: Bajaj complaint is that no matter what he does, the system crashes.
He has not made any specific complaints - they are all general accusations. She has asked
Bajaj to be more specific. Bajaj claims that the Post Office is not taking his complaint
seriously, for example that they haven’t attended his Post Office. In addition, the dates of
his calls to HSH and MBSC do not tally with the dates he says the system crashed. No claim
has been issued. He was suspended, but made a loss good of £8,000. That is a loss that
accrued over a period of about a year. He says there are ongoing problems. She doesn’t
know if he has since been dismissed and will check this and will come back to me. She will
also send me a summary in writing.
