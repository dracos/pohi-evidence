The Chesterfield View

DIT was problematic for TP; DIT 1 and the first DIT 2 reducing
confidence (but the second run of DIT was reported as ‘successful’)

TP believe that 33 days is needed to be certain of migration; MOT is heed Udens.
only 21 days, E2E has been extended to 33 days, but is deficient in NG wes
other areas

The weekly testing meeting is “very politically driven...issues don’t
get aired”

Concern that serious problems get watered down at each transmission
stage e.g. “Is everyone clear that we have not yet done a cash account”

a)
Concern that some problems from MOR 1 were never addressed, e.g. Juggs.

Model Office Environment

Simulating 7 offices gives sufficient range and volume
Inspection of the scripts shows them to be thorough and well specified
The control of the office environment is good

The rate of script and operator errors is no worse than should be
expected, and does not detract from the primary purpose of MOT

The timespan of 21 days is adequate for the primary purpose

The Model Office Environment is well planned and executed; fit for 4

purpose and to best industry practice
(so long as it sticks to its purpose)

— on22/10aBA file failed, loosing a further 1/2 day
— no interface files sent to TIP so far due to dates synchronisation

Reference Data

Reference Data is Central to many of the issues

* the current design of 3 independent feeds is messy
* Noevidence of cash account data mapping

— TP believe this was agreed by all parties (and is now planned to be
done)

* how can we verify that each time fresh data is dropped, the reference
data is correctly replicated

* balancing accounts could be due to a double error

Experience at other sites suggests there will be considerable I bes.

(Le. the current process is wrong for the type of testing proof we need
for TIP)

An extra run of MOR does not focus on areas of uncertainty

POL00028435
POLO0028435

Actions to Reduce Risk

1. Confirm the primary purpose of MOR’T is about office working and
procedural issues. In discussion with the parties, allow the Model
Office team to drop tasks concerned with financial integrity IF a
necessary to secure primary purpose. \lagesed ws
Sx Hare we 2. Construct a different test to demonstrate financial integrity (possibly x ie x
it fine? ? based on DIT). The cost of this would be significantly less than ee
another MOR run, and could proceed in parallel. & for Imthdagoah Hn

3. Review with Pathway whether they are getting value from current run
* of E2E. A quicker route to the end goal might be to stop, give Pathway

time to rebuild the system and then restart

Contingency Actions

4. Drop automatic interfacing of Cash accounts (TIP), but any underlying
problems would remain.

5. Offer only one migration option (either manual or 1c) to reduce the xX ast bed oy
complexity of testing.

6. Reduce the number of offices in.live trial so that the anomalies can be I
coped with

These actions are all unattractive in that they descope the programme.

Reporting

¢ Allanomalies found in MOT noted on an incident report

¢ After removing incidents which are not product defects, PinICLs are .
raised for rest.

* Daily reports are written by the MOT, showing Incidents and PinICLs
raised

BUT

¢ PinICLs are closed once Pathway believe they have solved the
problem

* Itis believed that errors may reappear in later releases, but there is no
system for tracking -

The data collected does not give Horizon a view on system stability

Resch. nracde te Lase an amesmenk §\ Oro

Needs for Test Reporting

* The daily reports demand much effort yet cast little light on trends and
stability

* Pathway needs to own an independent view of system stability

* This can be achieved using Incident Reports

[ Reports should not be closed until Horizon have verified the I
solution

¢ Aweekly testing report should show,
— Outstanding brought forward, raised, solved, Outstanding carried

oe) area affected (e.g. TIP) and product area
— The graph of outstanding each week is the most useful indicator of
stability.

¢ Pathways view will often be different; occasionally the two views
should be reconciled.

Communications within the
programme

© “Our views are sought, but appear to be ignored if not on message”
© “Don’t get feedback on PinICLs”, but this may be changing

These concerns, together with the previously mentioned problems of
working together, draw us to consider the extent to which the roles

and responsibilities of the Testing Group are serving the Programme.
