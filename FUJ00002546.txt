3 Annex A: Transaction Benchmarking Service

3.1 HNG-X
3.1.1 Summary

The Transaction Benchmarking Service provides a measure of transaction time performance for an
agreed set of transactions which may be varied at any time subject to the Change Control Procedure
and agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu Services. The Working Document entitled:
“Transaction Time Benchmarking Process” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0017) gives details of these
transactions.

Performance measurement (or transaction time benchmark evaluation) is limited to the Business
Capabilities and Support Facilities of the nominated transactions, no account being taken of any
manual or human/computer interface components.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Transaction Benchmarking Service shall not include the provision of
video transaction time benchmarking.

3.1.2 Service Definition

Transaction time benchmark evaluation shall be carried out in accordance with the method described
in the Working Document entitled: “Transaction Time Benchmarking Process”
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0017).

Transaction time benchmark evaluations shall be auditable at all stages of the process.
Documents to be retained include:

(a) _ the data giving the record times of the transaction time benchmark test transactions;

(b) aspreadsheet comprising the processed transaction time benchmark results, the
data captured from the timing exercise and the intermediate processing, including
any agreed revision made thereto following review by Post Office; and

(c) _ the test scripts.

Such documents shall be retained for a period of seven (7) years from the date of the relevant
transaction time benchmark.

Transaction time benchmark evaluations shall be supported by this document and the performance
statement Fujitsu Services shall provide to Post Office in writing arising out of each evaluation
undertaken in accordance with the Working Document entitled: “Counter Transaction Time
Performance - measurement and results”.

The contracted transaction time benchmark target times against which the transaction time
benchmark evaluation shall be measured are stated within the Working Document entitled:
“Transaction Time Benchmarking Process” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0017).

The Working Document entitled: “Counter Transaction Time Performance - measurement and
results” shall be up-issued following every benchmark evaluation and shall include:

(a) amendment(s) to the transaction time benchmark target time(s) arising out of agreed
Business Capabilities and Support Facilities changes resulting from the
implementation of a Change Request under the Change Control Procedure including
reasons for any such adjustment;

(b) _ the new transaction time benchmark system component and aggregate times relating
to the Release under examination;

(c) _ the variance between the new transaction time benchmark times and the transaction
time benchmark target times; and

(d) _ the variance between the new transaction time benchmark times and the previous
transaction time benchmark times.

The data recording part of the transaction time benchmark evaluation is carried out prior to the
implementation of a Release. This is not to say that the Software implementation is dependant in
any way upon the transaction time benchmark exercise or the results arising there from. It is the
successful completion of testing, which is conducted under the control and management of Post
Office that leads to the implementation of the software into the live environment as described in the
CCD entitled: TST/GEN/STG/0001 “HNG-X Testing Strategy”.

The Transaction Benchmarking Service comprises transaction time benchmark evaluation of
individual Business Capabilities and Support Facilities component times defined in the Working
Document entitled: “Transaction Time Benchmarking Process” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0017).

The Business Capabilities and Support Facilities component times are generated from the execution
of a representative set of transactions on a test rig within a test environment representing a real Post
Office Branch as far as is reasonably practicable, with normal counter operation.

The outcomes of the transaction time benchmark evaluation are compared against the counter
system component target times and the results of the previous transaction time benchmark
evaluation. Any adverse variances are analysed and explained as far as is practicable.

The initial transaction time benchmark evaluation results shall be presented to Post Office for review
within six (6) weeks of the commencement of the implementation of the Release in question.

The final transaction time benchmark results are formally presented to Post Office in accordance with
the Working Document entitled: “Counter Transaction Time Performance - measurement and
results”.

Regardless of whether the results of the transaction time benchmarking exercise have been
delivered, in the event that a Release is implemented and there is an obvious degradation in
performance in terms of transaction times and such degradation is visible to Users at the Branch and
reported to the Service Desk, the Incident identified by Fujitsu Services as causing the degradation
will be resolved in accordance with the Incident and problem management process set out in section
2.1.2 of the Service Management Service, Service Description and the Working Document entitled:
“RMGA Operations Incident Management Procedure” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018). To the extent that any
such Incident is caused directly by any action of Fujitsu Services in breach of its obligations under
this Agreement, the resolution of that Incident will be at Fujitsu Services’ cost.

The transaction time benchmark target times, where applicable and carried forward to the next
Release are subject to a five (5) per cent uplift with each Release to accommodate the likely increase
in system contention arising from increased functionality and complexity inherent in the Release.

Whenever an agreed system change affects one or more of the measured system components, the
transaction time benchmark target times shall be reviewed and amended by agreement between
Fujitsu Services and Post Office (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

The transaction time benchmark target times may also be changed as the result of an agreement
between Post Office and Fujitsu Services to change the transaction time benchmarking method.
Under such circumstances Transaction Time Benchmark Credits gained under the previous
transaction time benchmarking method shall be carried forward.

When, on completion of a transaction time benchmark evaluation, the counter system component
timings prove to be greater than the transaction time benchmark target times, this shall be deemed a
“Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy”.

In the event of a Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy the following provisions shall apply:

(a) Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld) a method of rectification, including a timetable, (a “Rectification Plan”) for
each Benchmark Time Discrepancy (which plan may involve the agreement of an
adjustment to the transaction time benchmark target times);

(b) _ if the Rectification Plan requires changes to be made to the provisions of the
Agreement including any CCD or Contract Referenced Document (CRD) changes
shall be made pursuant to the Change Control Procedure;

(c) any changes to the HNG-X Service Infrastructure required to rectify a Transaction
Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall be made at no charge to Post Office;

(d) each Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall not be a Default unless
the Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy is material and within ninety

Discrepancy the Parties have failed to reach agreement upon a Rectification Plan
and the Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy has not been rectified by
Fujitsu Services. In such a circumstance that material Transaction Time Benchmark
Time Discrepancy shall become a Default upon expiry of that ninety (90) Working
Day period; and

(e) a failure by Fujitsu Services to comply with a Rectification Plan (and therefore fail to
rectify the Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy) shall be a Default.

Management Service, Service Description.

3.1.3. Service Levels and Remedies

There are no Service Level Targets associated with the Transaction Time Benchmarking Service.

3.1.4 Service Availability

The establishment of the test environment shall be scheduled in the Release plan so that the
Transaction time recording part of the transaction time benchmarking exercise is completed before
implementation of the Software Release.

The Transaction Time Benchmarking Service shall be provided upon request to Post Office, (ina
timescale to be agreed with Fujitsu Services) following the implementation of an agreed change
resulting from a Change Request under the Change Control Procedure.

3.1.5 Post Office Dependencies and Responsibilities
Post Office shall review and approve:
the Transaction Benchmarking Service results;

any revision to the contracted transaction time benchmark target times or the latest
transaction time benchmark times;

all other plans and documents to be submitted by Fujitsu Services pursuant to this Annex A
