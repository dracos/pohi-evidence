See below. LGQC is sticking with “strong” prospects of success.

Ps. I'm ok for the meeting with Al tomorrow.

Dear Andrew,

I haven’t downgraded anything. ‘Reasonable’ was not my word. I believe we have a strong case because the

POL-0020435
POL00023956
POL00023956

Judge decided more than he should have done or was necessary for him to decide at the Common Issues trial.
He was asked on many occasions both before and during the trial to take great care not to trespass into the
territory of the future cases and I believe that he wrongly failed to heed that request. Many of his observations
are expressed as firm conclusions rather than cautious preliminary expressions of current thinking and that point
was not seriously challenged by the other side in the recusal hearing. If he had case managed the litigation in a
more disciplined way all this could have been avoided.

The latest recusal judgment is an aggressively strong defense by the Judge of his personal position. This is not
surprising. He dug himself into it in the first place and he’s now in the business of digging himself out. The
collective view of the team - having observed him during the trial - was that this is what he would do and his
refusal to recuse himself coupled with his refusal to give leave to appeal against that judgment was predicted by
the team. As previously explained I also believe that in all the circumstances Post Office has no real alternative
choice but to pursue appeals to the Court of Appeal against both the recusal and the Common Issues judgments.

All that said, and as previously advised, I cannot give a guarantee of success in the Court of Appeal. There are
always risks associated with litigation. I think Lord Neuberger’s view on prospects should also be sought by the
clients.

Regards,

Tony

Tony — do you have any comment on the question below? If you read up from the bottom of this short email
chain this should hopefully make sense.

Hi Andy

Sorry to be petty - LGQC told me when I met him (feels like ages ago) that we had ‘strong grounds’ to bring
the application for recusal. When I challenged him on what our prospects of success were, he said (not an exact
quote ....) he wouldn’t say ‘strong grounds to bring the application’, unless there were strong prospects of

SUCCESS .....

That now seems to be down graded to ‘reasonable’ ...... If that is deliberate then I need to be able to explain to
the Board why.

Counsel's view on the prospects of success on appeal has not materially changed following the recusal
judgment. They continue to believe the appeal has a reasonable prospect of success. If anything, Fraser has said
a few things in the judgment that may even help demonstrate apparent bias.

Kind regards

Andy

Now that the Counsel team have had a chance to review yesterday’s judgment, is there anything in that which
changes their view of the prospects on appeal? I have been specifically asked this by the Board so an early
answer would be helpful!

Thanks
