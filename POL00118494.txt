Have just finished at Bond Dickinson.

They have a good session with SS this afternoon and have found a possible way forward to look at themes rather than spot reviews
which will lead to a report in Oct although SS still anxious about this deadline.

Spoke to Susan on the way over. She is very cross about not being invited into the Board today and not being able to explain the
process going forward, including the criminal cases.

I told her that it wasn't an easy session and that the Board were concerned about the way SS had been managed.

She asked whether Alice had explained the background to their appointment, I didn't comment, but Susan is right that Alice was
involved in the choice not to go with one of the Big 4 and that it had to be independent report.

I didn't feel I could add any more Paula, so I didn't, but I think Susan will phone you tonight or tomorrow as she wants to
understand her position following the Board meeting.

If you want to call do so, but I will be traveling until about 8.30

Thanks
Alwen
