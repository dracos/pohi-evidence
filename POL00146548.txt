Susan was minded to slow this down: Brian Altman (our uber gc) may recormmend that POL cease prosecuting
altogether - therefore why waste the time and money committing to this person. This piece of work is not widely known
within POL.

Hugh. Best to ask Simon Clarke of CK who was present at Icl and attended the meeting with Expert and is very
experience criminal counsel and dealt with vast number of POL Horizon issues.

Jarnail

i think Lesley and Hugh should sign this off. Lesley from an IT perspective, that these CVs will mean they will understand
and be able to explain Horizon. And Hugh to say whether their background will be creditable in Court

Thanks

Alwen

For criminal prosecution and Civil litigation cases it is is essential for Post office to instruct expert witness to
produce expert reports on the impact of second sights interim report on the Horizon system. Please find
attached both CV from Professor Kramer and Professor Dulay from Imperial college London who have agreed
to undertake the expert witness work. Please let me know who has to sign this off in terms of exco and the
board.

Thank you.

Subject: Professor Kramer

Dear All,
Please find attached an e-mail received from Professor Kramer containing his CV.

You will see from the summary on page 1 of his lengthy CV that he has previously worked with
Fujitsu. I asked how long ago that was and have been informed that it was over twenty years ago as
part of a research project.
