SCHEDULE B2
BUSINESS CONTINUITY
1. GENERAL
1.1 Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the Applicable Services are supported by Business

Continuity Plans. Where requested by Post Office and agreed by Fujitsu Services (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) Fujitsu Services shall ensure that new
services are supported by Business Continuity Plans.

Fujitsu Services shall provide Post Office with a copy of every Business Continuity Plan,
as and when created. Without prejudice to Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of the
Business Continuity Plans set out in this Schedule B2, the Business Continuity Plans shall
not be subject to Post Office approval.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the Business Continuity Plans for the Applicable
Services are compatible with the overall service continuity framework set out in the CCD
entitled “HNG-X Business Continuity Framework” (SVM/SDM/SIP/0001).

Ownership of all contingency actions shall be identified in the Business Continuity Plans.
Contingency actions to be undertaken by Post Office in the event a Business Continuity
Plan is activated, shall be agreed by the Parties before inclusion in that plan.

The Business Continuity Plans shall include activation procedures and time periods within
which the contingency measures shall be activated.

The testing strategy for Business Continuity Plans shall be in two distinct parts:

1.6.1 _ initial testing before commencing the implementation of new services introduced
under the Change Control Procedure; and

1.6.2 regular testing of relevant Service components.

The Business Continuity Plans, the scheduling of regular tests and the review of such
tests shall be subject to joint periodic review (at least four times per year) by the Business
Continuity Managers, the findings of such reviews to be reported to the Service
Management Relationship.

When a contingency or continuity operation is invoked as a result of a fault in the
Applicable Services provided by Fujitsu Services, then the provisions of the relevant
Service Description(s) that are affected shall continue to apply.

Fujitsu Services shall co-operate with Post Office and provide such assistance as is
reasonably requested by Post Office for the purposes of business continuity and fail-over
testing of End to End Services (excluding the elements of End to End Services provided
by Fujitsu Services). In the event that such co-operation and assistance is requested by
Post Office, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall agree the method of working and the
periods for, timing and frequency of such testing so as to minimise disruption and risks to
