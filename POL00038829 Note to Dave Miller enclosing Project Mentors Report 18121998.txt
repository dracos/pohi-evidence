Dear Hamish,
independent Gonsuttant Review of BAPOCL Payment Card programme

Privileged and confidential, Prepared int contemplation of litigation
Position paper on Requirements Analysié

We have now completed & provisional version cf our position paper on requirements
analysis, a copy of which | atiach. We are of the opinion that the findings of this paper
give serious concem that the Payment Card System has been developed in a manner
trot creates a breach of the contract relating to the requirement in Clause 702 of the
Authorities Agreement to work to ‘good industry practice’ and that the impact of the
breach is fkely to be that the system will not be Rt for purpose unless extensive re-work
is cared out before implementation, causing further delay and additional investment by
Pathway and the Authorities,

The following paragraphs summarise the key conclusions from chapter 2 of the paper:

"We nave performed a requirements analysis fer BPS, which is predominantly a BA
system element, From our analysis we conclude that Pathway have made no attempt to
undertake requirements analysis in accordance with normal industry practice. This is
despite their having access to the SSR and subsequent requirements since April 1996.
Much of this work coud, and should, have been cone during the demonstrator period.

in more specific terms, we conclude that:

. DSS's requirements were complete in scope et the time of cantract signing, but
incomplete in detal, as was only fo be expected;

« only af @ detailed jevel were there gaps and contradictions in the OSS's
understanding of their requirements;

« Pathway failed to satisfactory enatyse the DSS's requirements during the
procurement process and as @ result significantly underestimated the effort and time
sequired to develop their solution;

* in the pedod since contract signing Pathway cave failed to satistactonly analyse the
OSS's detailed requirements. AS a result they have designed end partially built a
system without knowing wheinerit fully meets the DSS's requirements.

Pathway have failed to employ good praction’ techniques for establishing detailed
requirements, in broach of Clause 702 of the Autnorities Agreement. None of Pathways
claims thet requirements were poorly defined and ¢ or have since been expanded to

mised add weight fo the case thaf they have failed fo undertake satisfactory

Our experience of systems where requirements heave not been analysed satisfactorily is
that the system fails fo mwet the users’ needs. Ar effective acceptance test will identify
many such failings, necessitating considerable rework. The result is a
‘extension of the fime and cast required to complete tho system and roll it out. The
altemalive is fo allow unacceptable processing in the operational environment, with
unpredictable and potentially damaging resutts.

fn our opinion the fajure to satisfactorily analyse the requirements for the Benefits
Payments System makes it unlikely that the usec needs wil be met by the cument
Pathway system.

We do not believe, from our understanding of other elements of the complete Payment
Card System, that these other elements have been analysed using better techniques
than for the Benefits Payment System, $0 there is a concem that user needs for these
elements will also not be met by the current Pathway system.

We would be grateful f you woad pass these conclusions to the Authorities so that they
may consider their impact on the current delibarations.

Expert review of BAIPOCL Payment Card Programme
Position Paper - Requirements Optimisation

INTRODUCTION

Background

As part of the expert review of the BA/POCL Fayment Card Programme, we have
reviewed ICL Pathway’s undated paper of 53 pages entitled “Selection of Examples
of Problems Facing Pathway As Set Out In The Pathway Position Paper Dated
6 March: 1998". ‘Their paper presents @ number of claims about changing and
undlear requirements.

Investigatian of those ciaims required us to uxamine the business requirements
expressed at the tims of contract signing and compare them against the current
understanding of the DSS's requirements. We therefore reviewed documents from
both the Authorities and ICL Pathway which contained the definitions of those
requirements.

We were surprised to discover that no detalied analysis of the requirements, an
essential process for successful [T developmert, appears to have been performed.
To allow us to compare current requirements with the original requirements, the
review team therefore selected the Benefits Payment System CBPS"} element of
the system as a sampic, and assembled a draft requiremants analysis.

This work was based on documents from both the Authorities and Pathway,
together with vary limited informal discussion with BA staff at Terminal House.

Purpose of Document

This paper sets out our findings from analysing the requirements from the BPS, in

terms of:

+ identifying what approach Pathway adopted to establish the detailed business
requirements,

* considering the validity and merits of the clains made by Pathway;

« assessing the probable past and future irepact of the approach adopted by
Pathway.

Scope

Effective business requirements analysis is needed to achieve a satisfactory,
comprehensive business design. This can then be used as the basis for the
technical design of the high resilience, high volume system to deliver the required
service. We have not been able to consider whether the technical design process
nas been conducted satistactorily.

We have to date considered only the BPS system. Further work has recently
started to perform @ similar assessment ‘of the upproach adopted for other elements
of the system, such as EPOSS. Neverthelass our findings are, in our view,
sufficiently serious to bring into question the whole of Pathway's design process.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPACTS

introduction

From the succeeding Chapters of this paper it can be seen that we have performed
an initial requirements analysis of the BPS elemunt of the systam. We had expected
to base this on documents developed by Pathway showing 3 detailed analysis ot
the contracted business fequiremants Such documents do not appear to est and
we had to base our analysis on the original and current business requirements.

At present, we have no access to Pathway's internal documentation, and
consequently cannot tell for certain what Pathway have done in terms of
requirements analysis. However, 10 documents recognisable as formal, or indeed
informal, requirements analysis papers appeer to have been passed 10 the
Authorities. 11s. possible thet format analysis has been carried out by Pathway, but
we consider this unlikely from what we have seen and from the continuing problems
experienced in development of the system.

Conclusions

it must be remembered that so far we have ‘only performed the requirements
anatysis for BPS. which is predominantly @ BA system giement. However, from our
analysis we conclude that Pathway made no attempt to undenake requirements
analysis in accordance with nommal industry practice. This despite thelr having
access to the SSR and subsequent requirements since Apfil 1996. Much of this
work could, and should, have been done duting the demonstrator peried.

in more specific terms, we conclude that:

« DS's requirements were complete in scape at the ame of contract signing, but
incomplete in detail, as was only to be expected;

= only at a dotuiled level were there gaps and contradictions in the DSS's
understanding of their requirements;

« Pathway failed to satisfactorily analyse the DSSs requirements during the
procurement process ‘and as a result significantly underestimated the effort and
fime required to develop their solution:

«in the period since contract signing Pathway have failed to satisfactorily analyse
the DSS's detailed requirements. ‘Ag a resull they have designed and partially
built a system without knowing whether fuly meets the DS's i

» Pathway have failed to emplay ‘good practice’ techniques for establishing
detailed requirements, in breach of Clause “02 of the Authorities Agreemant.

None of Pathway's aims that requirements were: poorly defined and for have since
been expanded to necessitate on optimised solution are guetainable. indeed, the
very examples they have raised add weight to the case that mney have failed to
undertake satisfactory requirements analysis.

Impacts on the Programme to Date

inveduction

Withoul having completed an analysis of the business requirements set out is the
contract, Pathway can naver have been in a position to understand the detail of the
those requirements. Without that detail it is not possible to develop a system level
specification to bridge the gap between requirements and program specifications.
Without such 4 system specification & ig very difficult to design programs in a way
which ensures that all system requirements ere fully catered for.

“Opumisation"

Failure {o complete requirements analysis ana the consequent lack of detalles
understanding of what is required is, we believe, ai the heart of Pathway's
complaints that the Authorities are “seeking to optimise the system’. What they see
as optimisations are in realty the detailing of che business requirements which @
competent analysis would have identified:

« much more comprehensively,

« much earlier in the project, giving all parties more opportunity to consider and
agree options:

» at a point where they could have been incorporated into a coherent design at
minimal cost.

Estimating and Planning

Requirements analysis is 4 fundamental requirement for estimating the effort
required to develop software. ‘The most accurate estimates can be produced from
program specifications, themselves produced trom 4 system specification which is
lise’ derived from detailed requirements analysis, However, there are well
accepted tools, such a8 Function Point Analysis. which enable reasonable estimates
to be made from the functions identified during requirements analysis. Without
astimates it is not possible to establish resource requirements nor to develop @
soundly based schedule.

‘Other Elements of the System
While we have so far only completed work on the BPS system element, we have
professional analysis will be apparent in other
areas as we come fo review tham. This concem is supported by a number of
interviews with Authorities’ staff, from which it is apparent that Palfway are logtne to
release design decuments to BAPOCL. While they have on oeeasion cited
intellectual Property Rights as a reason for refusal, we are becoming increasingly
suspicious that the real reason is Urat the right level of documentation simply has
not been developed.
Of particular concem is the EPOSS system. We ave informed that at 4 relatively
early stage Pathway wanted tho ‘Authorities, principally POCL, to be involved with
the design of this element. The plan was to use the Rapid Application Development

APPROACH

Assessment of Pathway “Examples”

Many of the examples quoted in Pathway's paper claim that initial definition of
Many ante was of peor quality, and / of that there, es, Been, eu
expansion of those requirements. To assess the validity of those claims, Wo
needed to compare the requirements as defined at the award of cantract with the
current definition of those requirements.

Ag set out in Appendix A, requirements anatysit. is the vital first step in tuming high
level business requirements into systems speuifications from which software can
sucoesstully be developed. We had anticipated therefore that our comparison
would be between 3 requirements analysis post-contract and the current version of
that analysis, We could find no evidence in either the Horizon library list or OSS
fbraries of such an analysis. Discussions wih OSS staff at Terminal Hause,
Norcross and Longbenton failed to identify any «unrecorded but relevant documents.

We therefore axamined the Pathway documents set out in Table 2.1 below, to
agsess whether they in whole of jn part could be considered as supporting
Requirements Analysis.

Draft Requirements Analysis

This work was based inifiaily on the final version of the Authorities’ Statement of
Service Requirements CSSR’). This document was issued to potential suppliers, in
draft in December 1995. and as & final version in April 1996. While not @
contractual document, in our view this is a well produced and thorough document
which would have given any potential supplier the opportunity to gain a thorough
understanding af the system through analysis and questioning.

We used the SSR to draw up a Logical Deta Model (LOM) and Data Flow
Diagrams (DFDs*), both welt understood tools common to most formal analysis
methads. Appendix A sets out a more detailed description of requirements analysis.
This provided us with @ detailed analysis of the original requirements,

Once the initial analysis was complete, we reviewed other available documents to
determine if these changed the analysis in any significant way. The documents
reviewed at this stage were principally those produced by Pathway. although we
‘also considered a number of CAPS definition documents. uring this second stage
we also produces definitions of the principal tunctions, These are written using
indentations to show a logical structure, offen degoribed as structured English.

Changes Found

‘Once the requirements analysis was completed. we compared the LDMs and DFDs
based on the SSR with their equivalents derived from the current status, We found
no changes of any real substance, although, as would be expected:

» there was more detail in the later LOM, but noticeably only in terms of their being
additional attributes to each of the data entites. There were no new data
entities;

* the functionality (es depicted In the OF Ds) was litte changed, and in the main
such changes as there were reflacted the identification of processes to deal with
exception conditions.

it is of interest to note that, without attampting (0, the process aiso

jaentified one of two exception cases in terns of business process, While these

Tay have been identified hy Pathway and ‘ of the BA, these cases are nol

documented in the programme's technical library.

in our view, the changes found would have been identified by any reasonably

competent analyst following te methods we used or any of the major methods

widely available. Given the SSR as background, and the little time tequired, we
consider much of the functional requirements unalysis could have been completed
by suppliers before the contract was awarded.

Time Scale

Our analysis took four weeks effort from a singla consultant, spread over a pariod of
two months. Research on other issues occupied the remainder of his time.

Requirements analysis is an herativel task, which makes i difficult to be precise
about the amount of time spent 9 each individual activity, However, 8n
approximate break down wauld be:

« Initial (SSR) data model - 2 days
« Current data model - a further 3 days

« OFDs- 1 week t

« Structured English - 2 weeks |

While acknowledging thal the abave dork has so far only been completed for BPS,
we believe the smati amount of time requires suggests that the business
functionality of this element of the ole system is fac from complex, and can be
easily and rigorously modelled using standard tools.

FINDINGS

‘The Authorities have provided their own responses to the issues raised within the
Pathway paper. Of the 10 items presented in the paper, he following are related to
OSS requirements:

«Extended Verification Procedure

* Foreign Eneashment Rules

« DSS Reference Data

« Contradictory and Misleading Requirements
« Change Control issues

Extended Verification Provedure

issue
The early history of EVP requirements definition ifustrates the Authorities”
interference in design, and enhancement of the contractual requirements.”

Analysis

Pathway's siatement of the issue says it all - “he contractual requirements for the
Extended Verification Procedure (EVP) are vaiue and lack sufficient definition for
Pathway to develop its solution....". This being the case, why did Pathway fall to
take steps to estaplish the detalied requirements?

Foreign Encashments

issue

*The Authorities failed to comprehensively express their business rules for foreign
encashments which Pathway required to know in onier to develop Benefit
Cee ee Service BES") functionality, The foreign encashment rolaled
requirements are poory defined and of fmited use. Pathway has been forced to
Gokine foreign encashment business rules for the DSS. These difficulties have beer
compounded by the PDA's failure to property manage this issue.”

Pathway's summary of what happened:

“The DSS's inconsistent approach to ts own business aules in this regard became
clear in the course of workshops during October 1996. Pathway produced @
document interpreting DSS foreign encashment rules in December 1996, after
which extensive comments have continued 10 be recelved from the DSS and the
PDA, some conflicting. suggesting atlemative rules. Version 5 oF Pathway's Foreign
Encashment Paper is ‘currently under review.”

42.2 Analysis

The following observations can be made:

+ aS the Authorities had failed to comprenensively express their business fules,
why had Pathway not produced we detailes analysis that would have revealed
the gap?

« Why did it take until October 1896 to convene workshops to address foreign
encashments when the contract was signed May of that year

+ Why did it take @ further 48 months to get to version § of the document ial was
stil to be agreed? Only 2 relatively smail piece of logic is necessary (0 describe
the requirement. This does not require 18 months: work.

43 DSS Reference Data

43.5 issue

“Contractual requirements in response of OSS Reference data are virtually non
existent, Pothway has had to seek and reconcia extensive information in respect of
DSS reference Data from 3 omanisations (CAPS, (TSA and Blectronic Data
Systems (EDS) in order to develop ifs solution. These organisations have not
adopted a uniform or co-ordinated ‘approach to the issue and Pathway has, in effect,
been canying oul the DSS’ work of analysis in this area. Information has been
lacking, inconsistent between the 3 organisatvons, and generally of poor quality,
This has involved Pathway in extensive analytical work not envisaged under the
Related Agreements, abortive work and rework, involving cost and delay. The

43.2 Analysis
it Pathway had performed the detalled data analysis, the ‘geference’ entities would
have been Identified and specifications established with OSS, Because the
definitions need to be complete and precise, any gape would have beon identified at
fn early stage and appropriate steps taken fo fil the Gaps. (There are some 12 sets
of definitions passed by CAPS to PASICMS relating to business reference data. A
are Kemet Pao data model and could have been defined in detail dung the
is).

‘tne issue of ‘no single point of responsibilty withia the DSS. Responsibility was
dispersed aoress three organisations: CAPS, (TSA and EDS.’ is probably valid,
However, the analysis would have allowed Patnway to say “this is the data, who is
supplying it and in what form?”.

Pathway fail to distinguish between the definition of data as against the specific
values the data can take ¢.9. ‘Payee Role Nescription is a 20 character alpha
numeric attribute’ and “Payee Role Description can take the valves “Beneficiary”,
“Appoi ‘etc, The first is always important for specification and design. The
second it only important where specific values or ranges of values are identified in

A logical data model identifies which attributes are mandatory and which are
optional. Certain attributes in the reference date are optional, For Pathway to state
that ‘This only startod fo become apparent in about August 1997 when Pathway
received test data” is in effect a clear admission of the failure to analyse
requirements satisfactorily.

Contradictory and Wisteading Requirements

Issue

“4 number of the Authaties contractual requirements contradict other contractual
requirements, or do not accurately describe what (he authorities have subsequently
articulated to be their requirements. For example, requirement 94373 states that
whan a customer is no longer fo be supported by the Cont Management Service
{CMS), an ‘end of intorast’ notice will be sent to Pathway by the DSS. Pathway must
react to this notice by implementing a permanent card stop jor that customer. This

there has been @ previous card stop. Requirement 34/3 also potentially confiets
with requirement 716 and the Senice Intertace Definition dated 9 Fobruary 1996. A
further example of conflict is the requiraments relating to summarised receipts. In
each case, the conflicting requirements cause Pathways work programme to be

clarified with the PRA and the Authonities. The difficulty 1s exacerbated by the PDA's
and the Authorities’ lack of appreciation of the consequences of attempting to apply,
offen ii-defined, operational rules and procedures used in the existing paper based
system to the new aufomated system.”

45  Ghange Control Issues
Three examples are quoted by Pathway:
« Temporary Tokens & Casual Agents (CCN117)
» Unmatched Encashments
* Continuation Receipts
However, each relates to the following primary issue raised by Pathway.

45.4 Issue

“The conduct of the Authonties and the PDA in dealing with a number of change
control issues has often created significant prosiems for Pathway. The Authorities’
lack of knowledge of their own real requirements, conflict between the Authorities
and their requiremants; an inconsistent approach by the Authorities to Pathway; the
PDA's failure to properly manage the change control process; and prolonged
negotiations between Pathway and the PDA over change contro! time, cost and
requirement issues have adversely affected Pattway's ability to develop ihe
solution, Pathway has been faced with extens've delay, increased costs, abortive
work and rework,

45.2 Analysis

Change control is an essential component of an (T development. However, where
requirements are imprecise there iS significant mom for interpretation and change of
interpretation by the parties involved, A detaiied requirements analysis will provide
the focus for discussion of those requirements, with mo room for different
interpretations. The lack of such an analysis for the Card Programme provided
tertile ground for extended negotiations over changes. ‘The requirements were never
‘nailed to the floor.

As indicated elsewhere, this process ‘ef analysis could and should have been
started by Pathway during the procurement phase. To complain about the issue two
years later shows poor management and technical direction.

REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
‘What are Business Requirements?

Most IT systems are built to support businesses and organisations in carrying out
their aims. There are two main classes of peuple involved in installing a new IT
system, Gusiness Specialists and {T Specialists. These two groups fave very
different sets of skilis and knowledge.

« The business specialist understands what the business does, how it works and
what challenges are facing the organisation. They are business focused. Their
expertise in IT will seldom 9° beyond using @ word processing package Of
spteadshest.

+ The IT specialist designs, bulids and tests IT systems. Their particular area of
exportise is focused on computer ‘sofware and hardware, They may have some
knowiedge of the particular business area in which they are working, however
they are not he experts. indeed, having completed one IT system they will ofter:
develop another for 6 totally different appiication,

This nas been tue since the earliest computer systems and ig stil true today.
However, although they must ‘work clasaly tegather, they have found i difficult te
communicate ideas, definitions and agreements about what the business objectives
are, and how the computer solution will meet the business needs. They might have
a common language, in say English, but each has their own extensive jargon. They
use the same words to mean different things and have different words te mean the
same thing. The opportunities for misunderstanding are legion.

The early 19706 saw the first steps in establishing a standard set of activities and
techniques which could be followed by both groups and were thos a means of
reaching a common understanding of the business requirement and the computer
solution. These have evolved over the years, however the fundamental approach
has not changed, nor have the basic techniques used during the process. ‘The steps
can be summarised as follows:

4. Establish the business requirements,

2. Specify an iT solution which meets these requirements;
4. Develop the IT solution to the specification:

4. Implement the IT solution within the business.

Like a production fine, tne products of each uctivty are input to the next activity.
Different mixes of skills ore required for eact: activity. For example, iin activity 1
business knowledge is particularly important whereas in activity 3, specialist
‘expertise in (T is the primary need,

However, it is not just the sequence of steps that is important. During each slage,
specially developed techniques are used to establish shared understanding and
from that agreement on what the iT solution will do and how it wil address the
business needs.

A2 Identifying the Requirements
A214 Statement of Requirements

‘the first step will be to for the business to construct an agreed definition of the
scope and broad functionality of the required {T system. yn the case of BA/POCL
this was the SSR, which was later formalised as the contract requirements
catalogue. Such documents ean be used as a fist step in specifying the IT sokution.
However, the level of detail supplied about business processes, business rules and
business data is not enough to aflow the iT specialist to complete the specification
of the system te allow detailed design and development to be performed. A further
step of analysing the requirements is essential.

A22 Analysis of Requirements

Three areas need to be addressed:

4. The information about the business that needs to be held within the [T system

2. The business rules that have to be followed by the programs within the IT
system

3. The business events that will cause partioula programs to be executed in the IT
system

The analysis needs to be performed by specitists skilled in the use of particuter

fools and techniques that have been devaioped specifically for this task. Two

techniques are particularly important:

1. Logical Date Analysis - a technique used to produce & complete and
unambiguous definition {the Logicat Oata Model) of all the business data that
is to be stored and manipulated within the new IT system.

2. Functional Analysis - @ process to ensure that the business rules for

manipulating the business data defined in the logical data mode! are aiso
complete and unambiguous.

Note that both forms of analysis are focusing on the business requirements and do
not address issues of how the IT system js fo he designed. Indeed, itis possible to
perform the two aclivities without a view to implementing @ computer system af ail,
However, ‘Lit often appropriate to identify some constraints on the hype of solution
being sought €.9. the system software needs to be the same as existing fT aystems:
the Fea fect of the computer sereen/ keyboard should be consistent wit)
company standards; for What period the systent is to be ‘available’ each day. Such
requirements should be kept clearly separated trom the business requirements.

The final product of the analysis should be 2 requirements trace which identties
how every requirement in the requirements catsdague is embodied in the analysis.

The computer will need to support and implement selected business functions.
‘These business functions take data as inout, perform some actions upon itt and
deliver some results €.9. THe Encash Payments business function qnight identify the
payments for a selected customer, make the encashment. mark each payment as
tencashed’ and produce a receipt.

As their name suggests, OFDs describe how data flows between the various
business functions to be implemented in the computer system, it also identifies the
‘events’ on the boundary of the new systern which will cause something to be done
within the computer system ¢.g. & Post Office has been temporarily closed. This
event needs to be fed to a function of the system to change the recorded status of
the Post Office to ‘temporarily dosed’.

The process of ouilding the DFD allows cominon functions to be identified (ie.
things that are done for more than one reason) 5° that a single description of the
function can be produced. Examination of the data that flows between the functions
also helps identify any data that might have been missed in the Logical Data Model.
Where flows hava a complex sequence of daia ems, these wil be described in
detail using structure diagrams.

A compuler programmer needs a complete and unambiguous definition of the
business functions that are to be replicated in the comouter programs. Narrative
descriptions are inadequate, Structured English {sometimes known «8S.
pseudo-code) allows for precise definitions that both business and [T specialists can
understand. A simple example might be:

¥
The payment’s first-payment-due-date Is less than or equal to today
And
The payments payment-expiry-date 15 equal to or greater than today

Thea
Encash the payment
End-if

‘The functional descriptions refer to the entity types and thelr attributes as identified
in the logical data model. This may be supplemented by fists and tabtes, but the
Syuctured Englisn ts essential for unambiguous dafinition of business rules. tenis
missing from the logical date madel are also identified during this activity

‘The components of the requirements analysis described above are in business
terms only. Indeed, they could be produced without consideration of the computer
solution, However, it is often the case that the pusiness organisation already has IT
systems with which the new system fs te communicate, or has standards for such
companents as computer operating systems. These need io be clearly identified
and recorded so that the IT designers may take them into account when producing
the detailed design of their soltion.
