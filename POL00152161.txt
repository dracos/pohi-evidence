Subject: Panorama
All

As you will probably know, Panorama is planning a piece on Post Office and Horizon, repeating many of the allegations
already made in various programmes. Angela is fully engaged and the programme is due to air on June 29 (though this
may change).

If it does air, I am proposing a robust response, primarily aimed at informing and reassuring our people. I will be
discussing this with colleagues tomorrow but wanted to outline my preferred approach.

In advance of the programme (which we would expect Panorama to try to publicise) I would like to:

- hold a conference call with Crown regional/area and branch managers to inform them about the programme and offer
opportunity to ask questions

- do the same with relevant network teams, inc FCAs but to be guided by Michael and team

- send a message from Paula to whole business alongside a filmed interview with Angela

- use our internal channels (Subspace news etc...) social media proactively to publicise our messages
- engage with MPs

- consider paid media channels (ie full page newspaper ads - Mel is working on possible copy while Pete's team has
costed this option up)

I would be keen to get your input to this approach and support in executing it: the critical thing for me in this (apart from

vigorously rebutting the allegations and defending the business) is to make sure we reach the front line with reassurance
and information. Given Panorama's reach and influence we can expect colleagues to have questions and I would like to
reach as many as possible in advance.

Please do come back to me and thanks in advance for your help.

Best wishes

Mark
