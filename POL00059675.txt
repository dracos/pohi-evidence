Dear Sirs,
Re: Khayyam Ishaq
Trial at Bradford Crown Court — 25" February 2013
Further to the additional evidence please warn Gareth Idris Jenkins and Lee Heil to attend at
trial and given oral testimony.
Further to the service of the additional evidence at page 43 Stephen Bradshaw is
penultimate sentence states that no problems or discrepancies have been reported since
the transfer to a new interim sub-postmaster since the suspension of Mr Ishaq in February
2011, with regards to this could you please clarify whether further enquiries were made i.e.
as a full audit been undertaken since February 2011 and if so what was the outcome of that
audit.
If no discrepancy has been highlighted from a subsequent audit then please be on notice
that we will require that data to commission our own audit.
I look forward to your response and hopefully we can both work diligently so that this
matter can progress on the 25" February 2013.
