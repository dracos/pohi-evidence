To summarise the note from FJ:

- It was possible to do something equivalent to a BT on Old Horizon.
- Any "BT" would show in the master transaction logs.

- Searching for BTs would be a big job.

Based on Pete's previous comment that searching all transaction records could take months, I think we may need to find
a way to reduce the scope of the exercise.

I'll give this some thought and come back to you with a suggestion.

Kind regards

Have you managed to make any progress on this? Ideally, it would be good to get at least an outline view on cost and
timings by close of business tomorrow.

If possible, we would like to start with a broad approach so to understand when BTs have been used across the whole
POL estate. This will of course depend on the cost of that exercise. If you could provide an indicative cost, then POL
can take a view on whether it wishes to narrow the scope.

Is there a branch in particular that is the focus or wider?

Pete

We've spoken previously about Balancing Transactions on Horizon. For a number of reasons, POL now need to
understand in as much detailed as possible when BTs have been used historically.

In our previous discussions, you confirmed that there had only been one use of a BT since the rollout of Horizon
Online (around 2010). I understood that to look back further than this would be more difficult due to Old Horizon not
logging BTs in the same way as Horizon Online. However, my understanding was that FJ could, if needed, look back
through the transactions logs for Old Horizon to search for BTs — is that correct? This will of course be limited by the
availability of transaction data which will likely only go back to around 2008 / 2009.

If it would be possible to search the available transaction data for BTs, please could you let me know how difficult it
would be to do this? If it is a significant task, please can you provide an estimate of time and cost?

Kind regards
Andy
