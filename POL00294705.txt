Kevin/Angela,

Happy New Year to you both.

In advance of our meeting tomorrow, please find attached a document detailing the main events over the past 12
months in relation to this branch. Apologies for the length but I felt it important to detail the entire series of events as
Mrs. Athwal is likely to want to discuss everything afresh.

Tomorrow morning I will send through a file containing all relevant letters and correspondence that you may wish to
refer to throughout the course of the meeting.

Speak tomorrow
Tracy
