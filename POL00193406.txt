Another thought on this. As part of my handover someone needs to “own” of the master spread sheet. I think it can
be either of you — but something we can agree on Thursday.

Also, worth pointing out that some of the JFSA cases are ambiguous. I will ask Alan for clarification, in line with the
table attached.

Regards, Simon

All
Please find attached the master list. The names from BIS were all new to me, neither JFSA or MP cases.

Hi both,

Could the three of us meet up on Thursday to ensure we have everything in order before Simon departs. I
have 1030am until 1pm available so if we could start at 1030 and then see how we get on that would be
helpful. Would you send me an invitation for the time slot you can make please.

I'm keen to establish for my peace of mind that we have a master list of cases by categorisation ie MP
cases; JFSA cases; internal live cases etc. I don’t currently have this and Martin Humphries’ note of today
emphasises this.

I’ve set up a meeting with Ron and lan (?) for Wednesday with a view to reviewing where they are with
their cases and agreeing ways of working going forward. Andy — are you able to join us? The meeting is
from 11am until 3pm in Swindon distribution centre.

In terms of me getting a small team together to review the cases alongside Second Sight I have put out a
request for 3 people to be released from Network. One was from within NTP — Neil Ennis has confirmed he
will not be able to release. The other two are from within Michael Larkin’s regional structure — he’s not
confirmed either way yet but said he would come back to me tomorrow; let’s see where we get to
tomorrow.

Thanks,
Angela
