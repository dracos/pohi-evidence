Top Business Level Risks

Risk profiling workshops have been held for the five directorates for which they were scheduled. The outputs are being
consolidated with a view to providing input to an ET level refresh of POL's risk profile.



Completed reviews

Since the May 2009 report to the Risk and Compliance Committee, there have been no reports produced for POL



POL Ooen Actions

There is currently one overdue action from the WH Smith Financial Benefits review. The expected completion date is now mid
June.

There are 23 other remaining actions from seven IARM reviews. 21 of these are on schedule.

Of those for which timely completion is at risk, one, relating to Retail Cash Inventory Management, may slip beyond the end of
June target date. In the other case, proposed Equal Opportunities legislation may lead to a reconsideration of the validity of the
action.

• Overall Retail Cash In Tills holdings were under target by £42.5m.


Mitigating actions, update and status
• ONCH 300 - this programme of assessing branches payments v cash on hand has almost concluded. The number of branches reduced due to
   various factors and focus was directed towards high risk branches. £327k has been returned from 12 visits to branches and £983k has been returned
   following 14 scripted telephone calls to branches, a total of £1.3m returned. There are 5 audits outstanding, to be undertaken in the next couple of
   weeks.
• A new ONCH programme is planned to commence in July, to include new analysis of branches across the network and further review of lower risk
   branches not dealt with as part of the ONCH 300 programme.
• The new ONCH programme is subject to discussions around possible activities during the migration of all branches to Horizon Online. Opportunities
   are being explored which may result in a wider piece of ONCH activities within the business, supported by the Security Team.

Commentary
• The level of audit activity performed to date exceeds the current year to date plan
• Reduced event driven activity has allowed more risk based activity to be performed
• 65% of all audits undertaken up to period 2 have been targeted through risk based selection (including those initiated by P&BA,
  Cash Inventory, Security and Network Support as well as risk model outputs)
• From the available figures 6% of financial audits (selected on a risk basis), in period 2, resulted in the suspension of the
  Subpostmaster
• Net accounting discrepancies from financial audits year to date totals £859k
• 6% of branches audited, year to date, are responsible for generating 79% of accounting discrepancies
• 21 audits year to date have revealed net discrepancies totalling £676k
• An audit was completed at Cygnet House Cash Centre on 12th May 2009 and this identified a "some improvement required

Topcomm QofS Reporting
The Q1:2009 accuracy audit has now been completed with passes being reported, pending completion of the comparability stage, in
all 5 quality of service measures. This is the first time a pass has been reported for Service Provisioning since the beginning of the
managed service provided by BT. The decision has now been made by Ofcom to revoke the Topcomm scheme and, therefore, the
reporting of the Q1/Q2 results will be the final ones in the current format. We await confirmation from Ofcom on what, if anything, will
replace the Topcomm scheme but, in the interim, discussions have been instigated between Compliance, Operations & Marketing to
decide how we move forward, pending the result of the Ofcom consultation.
Crown Office Declaration of Compliance
The report on the results of last year's Annual Declaration of Compliance (ADC) has been issued and has included a
recommendation for a revised future approach, moving to a quarterly declaration on key themes and using Horizon for a self audit
testing. Consideration is also being given to extending a revised approach to parts of the agency network.

Network Change Audits
The Q4 audit, covering October to December 2008, has been completed and the report issued. Four quarterly reviews have now
been completed, covering the calendar year January to December 2008, and overall the schemes have been found to be well
operated with the bulk of compensation and grant payments made accurately. An IARM review is now awaited, prior to an assurance
statement being issued to DBERR, and this review is planned for July 2008.
Assurance Activity in Progress
• Review of the Compliance Framework
• Confidential Waste Assurance Review — To ensure that actions, generated as a result of the Information Commissioner Inspections
in 2008, have been implemented and review current levels of compliance in the Network.

• Network Change Audit Q1: 2009
• Review of recruitment processes — Covering vetting and induction training arrangements (aligned to an action arising from the NS&I
audit)

There will be a delay in completing the self assessment questionnaire (SAQ) for Payment           April       Sue
Card industry (PCI) on the portal. This is because a Royal Mail Group (RMG) project - OLP2 -      2009      Lowther
insist on a non compliant payment method, instead of using the standard Portal Payment
Manager (PPM) which is under development for all transactions processed on the portal..
PCI compliance is across the organisation, so RMG will not be able to submit their SAQ until
all business functions are compliant. If we have a delay in the portal the card schemes will
not look favourably upon Post branch, especially should we also have any delay on Horizon
Next Generation. RMG have a further risk that by preparing this application to go live without
full PCI compliance, the merchant acquirer may prevent live operation. There will be a
subsequent knock-on to POL.

February 2009
All projects have Received Communication from Group Treasury that BT BuyNet has to be
used. (Not in Post Office control)
The Likelihood of risk is now reduced because there is a clearer understanding. Likelihood
scoring now 3 and Impact 5 (out of 5).
March 2009
The work to implement BT Buynet has been undertaken and implementation is now expected
by the end of the month.
April 2009
Some work still to do to retrofit BT Buynet solution to existing products. Full implementation
is now expected by October 2009
June 2009
Travel Insurance have indicated a reluctance to move to BT Buynet at this point in time. This
is being followed up, because it will cause problems on PCI certification and also
maintenance contract for Retail Logic will have to be renewed for a further year for Travel
