Indicators 09/10

Commentary
The latest results show a drop in overall performance from last month (87% to 85%). This is mainly due to reduced levels of
compliant Bureau transactions over £5k, from 90% in April to 84% in May (which is more in line with the level of compliance

recorded in 2008/9). However, the Compliance Mystery Shoppi

e Scorecard

improvement, with an increase in score from 69% in April to 77% in May.

JA WTLL session on Credit Card was delivered in January
2009. Given the wider implication of the result of this
kcenario, a further WTLL session is being planned in June
(with a view to covering the broader regulatory issue, beyond
hat identified for credit cards)

There has been limited improvement, following the recent impl

lementation of remedial actions. Given that these have tended

to focus on training and communication initiatives, there is a need to explore (with Network Management), more innovative

approaches. Plans are in place to explore this further at a Compliance Workshop with the Account Managed segment )

Top Business Level Risks

Risk profiling workshops have been held for the five directorates for which they were scheduled. The outputs are being
consolidated with a view to providing input to an ET level refresh of POL's risk profile.

Completed reviews
‘Since the May 2009 report to the Risk and Compliance Committee, there have been no reports produced for POL.

POL Open Actions

There is currently one overdue action from the WH Smith Financial Benefits review. The expected completion date is now mid
June.

There are 23 other remaining actions from seven IARM reviews. 21 of these are on schedule.

Of those for which timely completion is at risk, one, relating to Retail Cash Inventory Management, may slip beyond the end of
June target date. In the other case, proposed Equal Opportunities legislation may lead to a reconsideration of the validity of the
action.

+ From all cases closed, year to date £237k has been recovered against identified losses of £360k.
+ The current year to date figure for recoveries is 66%.

+ The Security Team currently has 56 cases on hand, with a total loss £4.8m being investigated under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

+ Through the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 legislation, the security team continue to robustly restrain identified assets. This has

resulted in significant funds being recovered when cases are progressed to Confiscation that may otherwise have been dissipated.
Case Reference 0708/0269 was concluded following a Proceeds of Crime 2002 Confiscation hearing at Kingston Crown Court on the 27% May 2009.

branches not dealt with as part of the ONCH 300 programme.

+ The new ONCH programme is subject to discussions around possible activities during the migration of all branches to Horizon Online. Opportunities
are being explored which may result in a wider piece of ONCH activities within the business, supported by the Security Team.

B2. Assurance Activity - Headlines

Topcomm QofS Reporting
The Q1:2009 accuracy audit has now been completed with passes being reported, pending completion of the comparability stage, in
all 5 quality of service measures. This is the first time a pass has been reported for Service Provisioning since the beginning of the
managed service provided by BT. The decision has now been made by Ofcom to revoke the Topcomm scheme and, therefore, the
reporting of the Q1/Q2 results will be the final ones in the current format. We await confirmation from Ofcom on what, if anything, will
replace the Topcomm scheme but, in the interim, discussions have been instigated between Compliance, Operations & Marketing to
decide how we move forward, pending the result of the Ofcom consultation.

Crown Office Declaration of Compliance

The report on the results of last year's Annual Declaration of Compliance (ADC) has been issued and has included a
recommendation for a revised future approach, moving to a quarterly declaration on key themes and using Horizon for a self audit
testing. Consideration is also being given to extending a revised approach to parts of the agency network.

Network Change Audits

The Q4 audit, covering October to December 2008, has been completed and the report issued. Four quarterly reviews have now
been completed, covering the calendar year January to December 2008, and overall the schemes have been found to be well
operated with the bulk of compensation and grant payments made accurately. An [ARM review is now awaited, prior to an assurance
statement being issued to DBERR, and this review is planned for July 2008.

Assurance Activity in Progress
+ Review of the Compliance Framework

+ Confidential Waste Assurance Review — To ensure that actions, generated as a result of the Information Commissioner Inspections
in 2008, have been implemented and review current levels of compliance in the Network.

insist on a non compliant payment method, instead of using the standard Portal Payment
Manager (PPM) which is under development for all transactions processed on the portal.
PCI compliance is across the organisation, so RMG will not be able to submit their SAQ until
all business functions are compliant. If we have a delay in the portal the card schemes will
not look favourably upon Post branch, especially should we also have any delay on Horizon
Next Generation. RMG have a further risk that by preparing this application to go live without
full PCI compliance, the merchant acquirer may prevent live operation. There will be a
subsequent knock-on to POL.

Post Office Ltd priorities for a number of group wide functions differ. Our clients are
becoming more proactive in asking for assurances around data loss and data protection
techniques (Department for Work and Pensions in particular) for which Post branch need
an immediate solution. The risk is that RMG are working to a longer term strategy, which
gives rise to a lengthy evaluation and large scale project approach. Whilst we endorse that
strategic objective, we need our supplier to provide robust interim solutions now. Our
requirements as a financial services organisation demand them.

Delay in HNGX is causing a delay in completion of the Audit. The fact that we have track
