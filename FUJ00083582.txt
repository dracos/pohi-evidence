Subject: Run Map Timeout (PC0057957)

Hi Gareth,

T can confirm (having checked with Drew) that a timeout of this sort is likely to be benign in the sense that it should not result ina
message store corruption.

However had the operation which was affected by this timeout been a message server internal operation, for example and index
maintenance thread operation, then an additional error event should have been logged.

Therefore a possibility is that an API call has timed out and the application is not checking for error events.
In terms of progressing this I would suggest the following:

(a) Get the LFS Agent code checked to confirm that all API calls have error checking. I am happy to do this if the developers are
prepared to send me the source.

(b) Continue to try and reproduce this problem. Knowing what the Agent is doing (either source code or some design documentation)
would be useful.

If you want me to contact the LFS team directly then please let me have a contact name.

Many thanks
Mark
