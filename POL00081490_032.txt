Thanks Brian,
I've amended paras 2 and 30 of the statement to reflect Andy's concern (copy attached).
1. Is para 2 now ok?
2. Does Andy feel comfortable with para 30 or should that be deleted?
3. Anne Chambers + an independent IT expert should be able to deal with any technical
queries, but just in case, is there anyone at Fujitsu apart from Andy who could give this witness
statement who would be able to answer any technical questions if required?
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Kind regards.

Andy has concerns over his statement in that although it clearly states he is authorised to
undertake extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system and to obtain
information regarding system transaction information processed on the Horizon
system...(which he has done), and that it is not his particular area of expertise,
he is only authorised to do this extraction work and is not or was not,
technically involved with any aspects of any of the calls. As such he would not
be able to answer any technical questions which might arise concerning a
particular call. The nature of the helpdesk involves many engineers all at
differing levels and any number could be involved in a particular call.

Should a call be disputed or highlighted as a concern it would be prudent to make this
known prior to the court case so that an appropriate technician can be provided to
respond.

In view of this, do you think the following paragraph (which concludes the statement),
sufficiently explains this, hopefully to avoid an embarassing situation?

J should add that this area is not my particular area of expertise. I have a
yeneral knowledge of these procedures and have made the comments
above to aid the court. Do you feel able to say this: On the basis of my
overview of the call logs there does not appear to be any reasonable
grounds for believing that the information stored on the Horizon system
would be inaccurate because of improper use of the computer terminal.

Thanks Brian.

Before I disclose this to the other side, please can you just confirm that the latest excel you
sent me (copy attached) also encapsulates the data contained in the previous one you emailed
me on 16 June (copy attached) about software updates?

Kind regards, Stephen

No problem, I realise there are time issues here and we have placed some focus on this one, we have not
done any tidying up of the information, it is straight as it comes from the database and imported into Excel.

Hopefully it is what you require.
Kind Regards

Dear Brian,

We have recently had a meeting with Counsel to review this case. One of the issues arising is
