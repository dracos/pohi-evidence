Rodric

M029 is one of the cases where we have re-drafted the exec summary of the report. I'm happy with that attached final
version of the report however it refers to an officer's report and also a related investigation document — both attached.

Wayne, in Angela's/Shirley's team, has confirmed that the transcripts of the interviews with Thomas are not on the
prosecution file. This therefore appears to be a case where both prosecution documents are important to prove the
conclusions reached and there are no alternative documents on which to rely. Having reviewed both prosecution
documents I cannot see any material that appears controversial. As this is a high profile case, it may be prudent
however for either you or CK to quickly review the prosecution docs to confirm that they may be disclosed.
Unfortunately, I cannot see any alternative approach (even redacting the docs will be of limited use as we need most of
the info in both docs).

Please can you let me and Shirley know how you wish to proceed? I'm happy to liaise with CK if you want to go down
that route.

Kind regards
Andy

Please can you send me a copy of document 7 — the "Post Office Investigation Legal document"?
Do we have the transcripts from the Thomas' interviews with POL security?

Ihave accepted the changes and am now happy with the document. Please remove Doc 002. Would you please ensure

Shirley,

T have reviewed and made a number of tracked changes as I wanted to bring out the nil value transactions as the
probable explanation for some of the Applicants losses - he admitted to doing this at interview and if happened only a
couple of times a week he could have racked up considerable losses over a period of a year. Would you review please
and let me have your comments.

Thanks,
Angela
