Hi Saf, I’m good thanks. Just been with family in an area that doesn’t have very good phone signal (which can
be a good thing!) so apologies for not replying earlier. I hope you are ok and all safe in Bolton? The riots are

appalling.

lam just waiting for Nic Marriott to send me some information. So I should be able to pull everything together
in the next couple of days.

Best wishes, Amanda

Hi lan

In terms of SEG/GE, could you please provide me specific remuneration details from 2019 for the following;
Ben Foat

Zdravko

Geoff Smith

Angela Williams

I would like to see the pay structure in January 2019 and each year, to date, including increases or changes to salary,
including bonus plans, LTIP plans and side bonus arrangement.

I was made aware during 2023, at a Board meeting, that all the above had received salary changes, bonus payments,
LTIPs, side bonus letters and / or agreed post-employment benefits and I am not seeing that reflected on the data you
have sent.

lam aware Goeff Smith was due to receive a bonus if he delivered Belfast exit (which he didn't and was a waste of public
money). I am keen to understand other deals/incentives for these individuals that have been offered but not necessarily
paid.

I would like to see what was the max % or £ to all bonus payments and what was actual.

Could you let me see the side letters in relation to the above.

Thank you

Saf

Hi Saf
Apologies for the delay in sending this over, but it has taken longer than expected to pull some of this together.

In relation to your request for information relating to Exec pay since 2018, and in agreement with Amanda, I have pulled
together the attached, which is presented over 5 tabs.

This shows the annual % increases applied to CEO, CFO and GE (now SEG) in relation to the wider colleague population
for each year in the period.

I have also included information on national UK salary trends and how POL compared, plus the movement in National
Minimum Wage and Average UK salaries, to show overall growth in average UK pay over the same period. Finally, I have
overlayed this with changes in PM Rem for each of the years. Using a baseline of ‘1’ I have shown in a table and graph
how the growth in Exec pay relates to growth in Postmaster rem.

Ihave also copied the latest reported CEO pay ratio (taken from last year's DRR), which might be helpful context for you.
Other than the CEO and CFO's pay which is published in our annual report and accounts, due to GDPR I am unable to
share the individual salaries of any other POL colleagues, as this is confidential information and we do not have their
consent to share it.

Ihave also shown a summary table of leavers at Remco Grade (historically, GE) by leaving reason, by year.

I appreciate you may have been looking for greater detail in some aspects, but I'm sure you can appreciate our
obligations under GDPR to protect colleagues' personal data- but I do hope that what I have provided gives you some

helpful context.

Thanks
