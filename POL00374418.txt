Performance

In terms of detail regarding the suspensions:

£61,631.30 audit shortage - no admissions - no repayment and queries over Company operating Franchise

Operator arrested and bailed re theft of customers wallet within branch

Subpmr hospitalised and on life support - branch closed since 09/04/14 and defunded 01/05/14

£31,409.32 audit shortage - Subpmr admitted misuse of £30k to support retail business

SPMR arrested and bailed, loss of £26,394.26 made up of incident loss, cheque fraud and what appears to be a rolling loss -
Police investigation continues following robbery at branch. Assistant has been arrested and admitted to staging an incident
and cheque fraud - he has been detained

SPMR £85.06 over at audit, evidence of the Subpostmaster reintroducing a large amount of cash and there was also a large
discrepancy in the cash declaration made on the 28th May. Inconsistencies in explanations provided by the SPMR and on
assessment of the information available the risk to POL funds for further investigation be conducted while the SPMR remained
in post was too high.
