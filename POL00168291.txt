Dear all

As you know we have been engaging with the BBC Panorama programme in recent months in relation to Sparrow.
Despite the programme having been postponed twice, I am sorry to report that it is now due to air on August 17 (and
has been included in BBC schedules). We continue to push back very hard with the programme and are exploring
every possible avenue to challenge their unsubstantiated allegations.

As with the previous planned programmes, we will be implementing a full communications plan with a particular
focus on assuring colleagues across the network. I will update colleagues further as this develops but you can be
assured we will be providing colleagues (and particularly those in customer/postmaster facing roles) with clear
rebuttal and contact points.

With the documentary airing tonight, I do not plan any communications to colleagues on Panorama until later in the
week, followed by concerted communications after the final documentary is aired next week.

Alwen, you may wish to send this to the Board?
Best wishes,

Mark
