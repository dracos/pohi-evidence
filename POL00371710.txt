| would have though the 14 unlikely as it is too recent. Hugh can we check, or is it quicker to ask Gareth lesley
| will certainly be sharing this with Janet on Monday

This is massively important

Is there also a possibility that all incidents — 14 and 64 — have been referenced in court?

ly Witness Statement for the MISRA case

Lesley,

Attached is my final Witness Statement for the Misra case. This was heard in Guildford Crown court in October
2010 and concerned West Byfleet Post Office.

Page 14 covers my response to a problem that had been identified in an earlier case (that involving Lee Castleton
who took POL to court for unfair dismissal which he lost).

Do you need me to dig out anything more on this? | think the key point is that the fact that Horizon did have bugs
has been discussed in court and POL still won the case.

Regards

Gareth
