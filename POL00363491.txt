Owain, Gideon

Angela's statement is pretty much done. There is one section that I'd like to discuss with you. Itâ€™s the section on
Horizon at para 103.

Your original comments are also attached where you deleted much of the Horizon section.
I think this needs to go back in.

Is one of you around for a call?
