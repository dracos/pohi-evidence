Rodric,
Further to our call earlier we will take steps to issue the call and protect our position.

We will arrange for it to be stayed immediately following service and also make clear in our covering letter to Mr Walters
that we have issued so that we are protecting the position and it will not impact on the mediation scheme.

Many thanks

ires in 29/11/13 - Mr Terence Walters Your Ref: LIT/263431/MPD 2540988

Dear Alison, Rodric and Zoe,
Further to the emails below has a final decision been reached in relation to this claim?
I appreciate that there are several factors that do not make this a straightforward decision but we need to issue shortly.

Whilst costs are a serious factor, in light of the on-going mediation scheme, we would seek to stay the case
immediately to allow the mediation to run its course. This would stop costs from rising and would still allow the claim to

WBD_000678.000001
WBONO0000808
WBON0000808

be dealt with within the context of the mediation. If a claim is not issued the debt will not be recoverable (assuming Mr
Walters will not agree to pay!) and we will lose that pressure, which may be useful in the context of the mediation.

On balance I would recommend issuing a claim to protect our position and allow us the possibility of recovering the
debt at some stage in the future or at least allowing it to be a factor and dealt with within the context of the mediation

I am happy to arrange a telephone conference if that would help just to run through the pros and cons of this case.
Many thanks
Andy

Hi Rebecca

I have just been having a look at this case as I have inherited it from a colleague.

After reviewing the documentation Mr Walters DOB is the im $o this is not the same person .

Going back to available options I don’t think it would viable to issue a claim as the debt is only £11,846.37 and it
could the same or more I think the best oprion would be to close your file.

Alison/ Rodric

What are your thoughts on going forward, issue a claim or close the file? due to the limitation period expiring on
the 29"" November 2013

Kind regards

Importance: High

Good morning Stacey,
I hope you had a nice weekend.
Background

I write in respect of the above matter, which I understand was to be kept on hold until we receive further instructions
from either Alison or Rodric.

Current position — Limitation Issue/ Potential IVA

Having reviewed the documentation it would appear that an audit was conducted on 29 November 2007. As such, the
limitation period expires on 29 November 2013. In addition, having carried out an insolvency search on Mr Terence
Walters it has revealed a Mr Terence David Walters (TDW) entered into an IVA on 23 August 2013. The address for

er an hour away from Mr Walters previously known address. The date of birth (DOB) we have for TDW is
i I would be grateful if you could please review your documentation and confirm whether this matches Mr
“Waliers DOB. Should there be a direct match, we would need to submit a proof of debt to the IVA practitioners acting

WBD_000678.000004
WBONO0000808
WBON0000808

on behalf of Mr Walters in order for them to recognise the debt and get POL added to the list of creditors, you may well
have to address the Horizon issues a lot sooner than anticipated.

If there is no match, your available options going forward are as follows:

1) Issue a claim (without service) before the limitation period - At the date of issuing the claim, you will have
four months to the serve the claim on Mr Walters. This will ensure POLs position is protected from the limitation
period expiring and will therefore allow POL until the middle of March 2014 to internally make decisions
regarding the Horizon matters. In accordance with our pricing brochure, the costs to issue proceeding will be
£2,500 plus VAT, due to the fact that the matter is complex with the disputed Horizon issues. Should you
continue with this option, you may wish to consider that should the matter go to trial (which is highly likely)
costs can be up to £7,700 plus VAT.

2) Close the file — Given the various raised disputes by Mr Walters, you may wish to consider whether it is
commercially viable to continue with this matter.

Please feel free to contact me should you wish to discuss this matter.
I look forward to receiving your instructions.

Kind regards,

Hello Stacey,

That's absolutely no problem at all, I will continue to keep this matter on hold.

On a completely separate matter, I have now drafted the Particulars for Andrew Mead and await Will's approval. As
you are aware he will be in Chesterfield with yourselves tomorrow so I anticipate sending the draft across to you on
Monday.

Have a nice afternoon.

Thanks, Becky.

I hope you’re well.

In regards to the case below I have spoken to Alison and she says it was one of the cases where the integrity of
Horizon was challenged therefore we received a claim against us. As far as she is concerned the claim against us has
been put to bed but the outstanding debt still remains so our part of the case needs to remain open but be put on
hold until further instruction.

She is currently in talks with several colleagues over these cases and will be in touch in due course either personally
or via Former Agents.

I hope this helps.
