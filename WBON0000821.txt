Thanks David.

I know I am sounding like a cracked record, but we need to get SS to articulate clearly (in writing) what they mean
when they say our reports do not “sufficiently deal with the issues raised by applicants”, i.e. by stating how and
why the response to a specific allegation is deficient (Linklaters’ draft letter on SS’s Castelton report would be an
example of how to do this!).

SS had a similar crack at us in the July 2013 Report with the Spot Reviews, even though: 1) they did not raise this
with us beforehand (so at least that’s some progress); and 2) did not challenge their substance, only that they were
“overly technical” (an extraordinary statement from forensic accountants investigating an IT system).

I therefore would not want them to use our case reports (some of which they have had for months) as a vague and
generalised excuse for their inability to produce appropriate work product in a timely fashion. Conscious that they
might try to do this, I made sure the first reports sent over to them expressly sought their input on form, content
etc (see attached Angela Van-Den-Bogerd email of 28 November 2013 at 12:35), which may weaken their ability to
do this.

Kind regards, Rodric

David / Chris — FYI below. SS have cancelled our meeting tomorrow to discuss the factfile and will not be producing
their thematic report by tomorrow either.

I'm not sure that there's a lot we can do to force this situation but I still think that a meeting at some stage with SS is
critical. However, it may be useful for Angela and I to call Ron before the WG call about (1) their workloads and (2)
their comments below about problems in POL's reports as this is the first time I have seen this complaint.

Open to suggestions.

Kind regards
Andy

Angela: It really won't make sense at this point for us (or even just Chris) to
have a face-to-face with you. We (all three of us) are totally engaged at the
moment dealing with:

¢ working on our Thematic Issues Report (as we will report tomorrow to the
Working Group (and in more detail on Tuesday), the Report is not available,
even in draft form, because there is much work still to be done both by
ourselves and by POL in order to get to the bottom of the issues raised by

WBD_000691.000002
WBONO0000821
WBON0000821

the applicants and not least because the content of POL's responses on
the 15 cases so far completed simply doesn't sufficiently deal with the
issues raised by applicants).

e dealing with the pre-review of the incoming CQRs

© processing the Reports that you have sent us on those cases that you've
finished with

So... let's try this week to just get by on phone calls and emails.
Obviously, as a result of this, Chris will not be travelling to Bristol tomorrow.

Best regards, Ron.

Hi Chris

To confirm arrangements for tomorrow — I have arranged for us to use BD offices in Bristol with a 10am start to allow
for travelling. A parking space is booked for you should you decide to drive (the parking is underneath the building
and the entrance is around the back). Bristol Templemeads train station is also quite close.

It would be helpful to see a copy of your generic approach in advance of the meeting. This report is due today and will
no doubt be uploaded to Huddle. If this happens after 330pm today would you mind sending me an e-copy as I will be
travelling with no access to huddle.

Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
