                                            AD `ICE




1.   'ollou tng Judgment in Past Office Limited             Castyton I have been asked to
     provide a short written advice on the key points that have emerged from my
     involvement in the case as           whole and that :judgment in particular.        f should
                                      a




     emphasise that this Advice has been written as a short preliminary overview and
     should not he relied upon as providing a final and definitive consideration of all steps
     that should he taken in order to ensure that the post Office derives maximum
     advantage from the judgment.


2. The first point is that it is easier to sue a suhf-postrnast;r on an account produced by
     hint than try to prove that a loss has arisen € n the business. 'lying to prove such a
     loss, if it is pnsthL to alt.        nnmJy dt hcult taranskc          and wt fl inevitably be
     expensive and. auee_consuming.


'. The second paint is that the Post Office derives a significant advantage in litigation if
     the suss-postmaster boars the burden of proof to show that the account sued on by the
     Post Office, such        the Cash Account (Final), is wrong, rather than the Post Office
                         as




     ha, i.ng to prove that the account sued on is right.


4. This reversal of the burden of proof cart. only occur if the Post Office is suing on the
     suh_postmaster's own account, i.e. on a formal                        produced by the sub-
                                                             account




     posttmmaf,. r and tendered by him to the Post Office as his confirmed
                                                                       m e statement of the
     trading that has occurred.

     is onli' likely to be treated
     the sub nost:niaster (ii) at least in circumstances where he is contra:tua l' requirort to
     Froduce and verifY,; the figures as accurate, but preferably where he t€ rnia]ly certifies
     the flgur€s as such, and (.ii3 where the suh- ustinaste              p.It'            signs off




                                                                                                       €




                                                                                                           e
                                                                                  sicOly
     accounts as such.     ': , ur).n     ens eket'onicaUy.


Cu   the third and final point is that if and when it is decided that a sub-postmast :r is to be
     suspended or removed from post, he should he required. in accordance with the terms
     of his contract, to produce and sign a final account to the date of his removal, ,ihefer

     or not the Post Office has conducted its own audit. The purpose of requiring This is
     simply to rely on the reversal of the burden of proof and remove me necessity € uo gh
     riot the d.es€rahiilit:y) of having to real) the auditors to prove he loss.

    I hope you`ve had a great Christmas and New Year

    Just to recap on where wed got to before you went away and to update you on the
    current position:

    1. Towards the end of the trial, during the latter part of Anne- Chambers (Fujitsu)
    evidence, she stated that in 2004 when s h e investigated, she looked at the Tivoli Events
    logs, She said that these were not documents which Fujitsu had previously given to us
                                                                                                                                                 POL00090437

6. On 21 December 2006 I sent the' Tivoli Events Log to Mr casts<eton. The court has
now orde ef: that if Mr Ccstleton wishes to pursue his application for a further hearing,,
the .i €r 0                                                               .

what exact'                  it is he is seeking        and whether          ;e intends      to proceed.            My impression         is
that he doesn't really know himself, but that h 1L °r.ver relevant the document ;• , he ,,hi
try and make as much as possible out of it and that 'cc w                tie: Home end up in Coot a

  . cc'a'cc -' op ;i 3licc,t-on for permission to appeal. C. •, tics ether bend, his stance is
iFt      t     further costs and I have made the point to him in en3-respondence so that at
the appropriate time, we can draw this to the Court's attention.

8. It is possible that if the judge dismisses Mr Castieton's application next Thursday,
that we will get judgment on the same day. Either way, I will keep you updatred.

Kind regards.

1 have received some very good news about this case but now need the business to make are urgent
         upon ifs f tursconiuc:

Cur on .fir al Calm earnest ^:::Ai": ion3 was in the recio `: of 25K and he then ente e?d a defence and
counter claim for 250K but of more €once:rn brought the whole `JuZliti€ v of th e HORIZON system into
giuestion, As a wait we have expended a tot of legal accts to ensure that trio defence 10 those
 Eic: i.)%i 3oris is as perfect        i (?'..? s l,ie


On Friday Carrtletons solicitors ;r-r'ern:led thrdr tie1"ance, cc nte_c?a€rn to reduce their counter cairn to
11K.

Last, nightour harrd.ster received a compromise offer from Cat; tleton#`s solicitors pro bab€y- brought on by
the tact that they a.,; c wa ged to serve their statements on Friday together with their accountants    report.
We suspect that thOr accountants report has not supported their clan.
The Ira € c:ff&r is as Chow::
1, they otter tlhe sum of £22730 in settlement of our claim
2. our costs or the standard basis
3, they bract s. t€:3 agree to nay rent or get the temp to pay rent for the continued occupancy of
      Manna      Dove
4.   th% s :. ei'I. un io pa -, ihuwages              of the assistant emplo'y'ee there
3,    they vw at?i esther       from us         2 •,lira that proceedings were ss €e ! purely to recover a debt and that
     there was:     no   aila.g.at   :on   of   c snonesty




We can respond in a number of ways.

3 ii,,Aiy   I think tl nt, e can alt agree tha their demand                           at ? a..r. .. a ...rtnr      be aceer,<ted -.)ecaunc: ._s .. Fa;r'd

tkr"'O:Csi"#t 'l,y as we have never pleaded              that t,>Fa._ tleton was dishonest                   there is no problem with us
agreeing to to s deF a      We believe mat he is seeking                                  to go back to work in the city and as such a
statement  horn €.€s could be very valuable to him.

Thirdly the offer is defective in that it does not mention interest at all which we are entitled to on the
debt

Pourthiy no offer has been made to give a declaration to the effect that he withdraws ail his allegations
about
the HOR1ZON system

Fifthly as we made a Par: 6 utter to him in Janam of'2'006 sating that if he would Pay our full claim
we t`Aoi -€ J not seek our L. to whch ho nt acted .he is now nbl€ued to o - alt z_sty an the                      iv

succes     fr. party would recover between 50 05th of the costs expended. Any distacie i s 'Eacivet in
favoured the paying party. Costa on tr:e indern :,}y basis means one recovers almost all of ones costs
and any dispute is resolved in fatic,. r of the rocemng party. So there is quite a, diffe€encee between The
two.

                                                                                                        POL00090437




Sixthly the reason given for not paying the fi.,€=, amount of'the claim is spurious as we have
demonstrated to them on a number of occasion that therm is no basis for their allegation that the
accounts were '3.509,18 short on week 49.

Seventhly the position in respect of costs is not as clear cut as it appears ai first because tie Courts
have an a bili.ty to cap the amount of costs awarded so as to make them proportionate to the size of the
claim. However they have to take a number of factors into consideration not merely the size of the
claim but the conduct of the parties, ours has been impeccable, the importance of the issues to the
parties, proportionality of the costs incurred to the size of the claim has however been emphasised in a
recent Court of Appeal decision. Therefore there is a risk that by rejecting an offer of standard costs
that the Court could decide to cap the costs at say 60K and then award only 88°% of that. Costs to date
including the work in progress and the work wtiich the accountants have done together with Counsel's
toes come to approximately 140K.

However the trial is still a little while off and I think that we should aim for Castieton agreeing for
judgement to be entered against him in the full mount plus an agreement that he will consent to the
   ymont of a fixed sum in respect of costs. As a trade off we can otter the letter confirming that there
was no dishonesty and agree that we will not seek interest at an indemnity level. The benefit of having
a Judgement against him in the full amount is that we will be able to use this to demonstrate to the
network that despite his allegations about HORIZON we were able to recover the `ill amount from :h ires.
It will be of tremendous use in convincing other postmasters to think twice about their allegations.

Ever `1          :tter otter is rejected we still have time to negotiate but as we move nearer to the
                     are incurred daily so it is vary important that we reach a decision and

As we discussed last week I arm writing to update you or) certain points that came out of
my discussions on the Castleton case with Richard Morgan of Maitl nd Chambers.

Overview

Richard Morgan believed the case to be one with a good chance of success but he did
vvan that was dependent upon the accountancy evidence staching up in our favour (1
return to this below) and also upon an acceptance cf the costs in    sing this matter to
trial. We have discussed costs before. I also return to this point Leow.

A further point made by Richard Morgan was that we should endeavour to move the
main area of focus in the case away from the Horizon -system it possible. Rk-hard
suggested a method to do that would be to prove (: p.rsetr13a) °.h- physical cash losses at
the Marine Drive branch by reference to all the uthe eucumentaisuncreated amid the
transactions, not simply by reference to what was in fact recorded cr1 the Horizon
system. So for example when -. cheque is; _ on: ted there rS 'as I undersand it) a
counterfoil filled out which ,5 sent off dri ly by the sub postmaster, with all cheques
eventually ending up at EDS. If the Horson system was later found not to match the
physical rem ittances €n error nonce is generated. One of the issues in this case > that
there were fey,, error noti ces generate,,) suggesting toot the physical
                                                                      .al rem ttances did
match the Horizoi, :nput,s Clean y5 to attempt '..v luck into such natters in the level of
detail likely to be required will be costly and two consuming.

Amendment of the        articullars of Claim

Richard Morgan would like to make some few minor amendments to our particulars of
claim. Currently they are drafted      plead your claim on a breach of con ear'1- basis(i.e.
                                    to




the suh-postmaster`s obligation to make good the losses as contained his contra—U,A
Richard would like to go on to ai:so include a plea that the sorb--riostrnaster is your agent
and therefore has a duty to account to you for all losses in any event. This is not a
major amen 1ent and CCastletcn's lawyers already acknowledge he is an agent ekny
consequential amendments will, therefore, be limited. € he reason for the amendment Is
to put the case at its strongest and I suggest that such an amendment be made. I would
be grateful for your vow uro this.

Fujitsu

In this matter Fujitsu are clearly going to play a role. I understand that Fujitsu are
currently       ri at the matters raised in a :otter of 25 July 2006 from Castletons
lawyers (cops unclosed for ease of reference). One of the pivotal issues in this matter
Will hr tie arithmetic used throughout and I would like to know the answer from Fujitsu
as soon as possible to the points raised by Castleton's. lawyers. Is there any pressure
you can bring to bear upon Fujitsu to cause them to answer this letter in the near future?
I would be roost grateful if you would consider this.

One other point raised by Richard was the integrity of the Fujitsu product generally. Just
to c:onfirru, I understand that ftc= r'ml Mail/Post Office know of no Issues
                                                                          :.s, .e th the Fujitsu
system and are confider: fiat it oper=ates correctly, Please dine rs i €.: with me if you
have a different view.

Which Court?

You may recall that Castleton's lawyers had this matter transferred from a local court to
the High Court in London. Richard is strongly of the view that it is possible a High Court
judge may take an adverse v i ew,,, that this matter is before him given that, initially at
least, it is a claim for between f '5,00) £11,00€0. i ichard feels that we should write to
Castleton€'s lawyers and suggest that given the nature of the claims the matter should be
transferred to the Central London County Court - Chancery Div. lion. Richard has a high
                                                                                                              POL00090437

Counsel also 3<aised the issue of the possibility of costs capping he. the court asserting
that costs sins up to a c{   in level should be awarded This could come up as an issue if
the s<udee rakes a em on proportionality (he. costs verses revel of claim). There are, of
course, argurner t that can be deployed to try to counter this issue -- should it in fact
come up - but I thought it worth raising here.

As we discussed (and S,f olrojes for raising this matter again - I know you are aware of
this advice - but I raise it }--ere for the sake of completeness', the costs of pursuing this
claim ml sic r: ificantly exceed what is at stake. Accordingly, even if you win, the P,O will
aimoss cerr :n,y not make a net gain as your costs will be assessed and possibly capped
       _.

  s        odor  .aa r i €s nr}c u,_ r. Accordingly the purpc e of pursuo g this claim now is
    t t.o mobs         :-n,anci3l recovery, but to defend the Horizon system and hopefully
send a. ,O C< - message to other subpostmasters that the P.O will take a firm line and to
deter others from raising similar allegations.

Summary

The above; I bel ieve, covers the main issues of substance that were discussed, is have
not sought to rectord all the dots ` of all the matters covered. Once you have had the
chance to c.or sider tie: above T v,, ould clrsateful f you could give me a call or drop me an

   Dear Graham and Dave,

   On Thursday of this week (18 May) we b n .,c to exchange with Mr O.astleton's solicitors al l
   info relevant to the claim and countercidim wroch either helps or hinders us.

   I understand that you may have obta ed =€Enslavant N ,,,SC and HSH call logs. I already
   have:

   HSH call logs from 28 January 2004 to 24 April 2004
   NBSC call logs from 19 January 2004 to 23 April 2004.


   Please can you forward to me today those call logs from 1 December 2003 to 19;'20
   January 2004. January 2004 is more important than December 2003, because it is when
   the losses really started accruing, but both would be ideal.

   In case you do not have these call logs, I aria copying this email to Andrew else and
   Brian Pinder who may be able to assist.

   I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

   Kind regards.

  Stephen Dilley

        s responses thus far haven't really helped answer                                £iris posed, in tapir Caase, their
        responses have been i   £af to say the least,

My own op n€on therefore is that PD Ltd needs to cover off all questions relating to office
mis-balancing & transaction details, (we should have NBSC call records detailing any issues bought to
our attention) and that Fujitsu should provide us with a general statement for each case (as per the
statement above from Bill Mitchell) detailing calls mare to the HSH. If you agree then l will ask Brian
Pinder to provide such a statement in respect of Marine Drive & Torquay Road covering the periods
detailed above.

No doubt we'll spear. soon.

Mr Castleton`s case is that any shutfah is eno ,.ly the fault of problems with the Horizon computer and
accountiap system at the Manna ha lve. Post 00cr. and '.,rot the PO wrongfully terminated his Sub

We attach copies of the to Owing;

A. Without preiudire letter dated 30 September from Mr Castleton's solicitors to Bond Pearce LLP,

3, Bentley Jennison€€'s Report dated 23 September and attachments;

C. White & Hoggard's Report dated 18 August.

Bentley Jennison state that def aides have probably been brought forward despite the fact that: they
have been enrered nato the si sae„se account entry, They suspect this is because the Horizon system;
oespite they          account en.try, has faked to recognise the entry on the deny snapshots. They have
                   suspense



  awn this conclusion through lookin -t at the dacr•ep ncy of 23,509.1B on Thursda F.          February 2001,                  .2   6

such, Mr Castief. n's Defence, 'appears to hold potentia; merit based on the limited documentation" they
have so far reviewed. White -& Hoggard reach ,a s.i€ iiar conclusion in their Report,

Mr Castleten bel' ves that if he can ohl_un fur. 3er documents. such as the daly ampruats. to will be able
to unde tare a manual reconciliation of he cash ac unf: it order to substantiate his l,:elr::+f that the losses
are not real but attributable to corn outer error. We attach an email from Fujitsu to Richard Benton at the
Post 00 e dan c. 5 Ma 2 ;4 :r which- i-ugi°su sta>:a „It is possible that they are not accurately recording all
transachoris on the system" and that there was no evidence whatsoever of any system wb,;em,

      (a) There was natl ,ir          tJ`:rir€n with Horizon, because it simply reflect              the information entered on to

            report was obtained d:rectiy by our client as a "second opinion'` on the rrethodol gy that our client had used
            in reviewing the available documentation, To avoid any question of part ality7, we commissioned Bentley
            Jennison to consider the same documentation as had been available to Mr Richardson, as well as his rep;rt,
             as to eoounent en whether they agreed with its findings.

This schedule: also shows that cumulative deiicthncies of fg,243,10 were put Into a suspense

The identical amounts of £3309.18 point to two         cnsthle scenarios, either that (a   there has

I am unable to explain the € ifference of 50 pence between the suspense account iµ:ur , a? d the

Mr Castleton infbrnied them this was a manual entry foUowlrsg nstructions from Horizon

The £3,589.68 appears to represent the entry on the suspense account (Documentent 4) for the
same ansount, processed on 27 February 2004 which I -, °ould expect given the daily snapshot
entry.

Suspense account

A. a€npenso account is p, .fer iy w)'e by accowitants to `park' transactions that have either
been erroneously posted and are pending ;,orrection, or which3 as is the case here, are
trarisaationa that are either aunrenou ilfed or unexplainable.

From my experience, the impact of a suspense posting would allow a line to be drawn under
the cumulative deficiencies on the daily prints, effectively resetting the figure to Zero which
should be reflected as such on the end of day= print.

However;, it is evident that on the end of day print (Document. 5) there is still a deficiency of
 ~fi„09.18, n.. twsthstsndsrgtns suspense account entryg.

For the final day of week 49, Wednesdays 3 March 2004, the entry of £3,509.
recorded, however the total detidderacy now re ws £3,512.26 (Document 6), an inure we ci
£3,08, and supported by the final Horizon Cash Account print (Document 7).

1 note that in week 49 the cost of a first class stamp was 28 pence. The increasee f £.3,08
could, therefore, represent (and in line with Andrew Richardson's opinion) a scenario
whereby a book of 12 first class stamps was sold, but only money for one single stamp was
taken (be (12 a 0,2) — 0.28).

Having already concluded that the syst rr should have no longer been recognising the
£3,£:9.13 (posted to suspense) on a daily basis., the only discrepancy for the week should, in
my opinion, have been the 3,0 deficiency apparently bonze on Wednesday 3 March 2004.

The system has, therefore, appeared to overstate the deficiency for the week by the amount of
the deficiency in week 48, being £3,509.1.8.

The report of White & ioggard essentially appears to reach the same conclusion, in that this
sm has been erroneously double counted.

Based on this approach, the integrity 4ci` t ~ system is heavily dependent upon weekly figures
being both accurate, and carried fon,varb correctly.

In the isolated case of week 49 this appears not to have taken place, with the implication that
errors could, theoretically, have been double counted over a number of weeks,

As such, Mr Castleton's defence, that the root of the problem lies with the inaccurate figures
produced by Horizon, appears to hold potential merit based on the limited documentation I
have so far reviewed.

necessarily mesa that it has been replicated for other weeks. This can only be checked
through an analysis of the daily snapshots for all relevant periods.

Andrew Ricl . ;.w l s conclusion that , the balance gf,proo abilities wcnn/i sagest that it is
quite likely thut this has nice h« >pened in earlier periods is, I suspect, a little patmaturc and

The documentation .I would ideally need sight of (further to that listed in your letter dated 11
April 2005, and .presuming such papers were used in the nonnal course of business at the
branch) to gain a clearer picture of how Horizon worked, and whether it was working as
intended, .is as follows:

    • Daily sn apshc:ls ft r the fi r.'. i€.:ft rec din , r rrrin,£r, and followina the alletred

      if considered cost effective; it may be appropriate to analyse the pe-iod .h em when
      Horizon was first used in the branch to gauge the effectiveness of the system hoar
      Day One

    • Copy of the full audit report following the inspection made by Helen follinworth
      and Chris Taylor, on 25 March 2004, to include a breakdown of the week 51 balance
      off11,210,,56 (Document 2)

    •   P&A reports produced for week, 39-53, summarising surras paid to customers in
        allowances through vouchers, and any vouchers supporting the reports

    • Cash and stock count at the points in time when Mr Casticton began/left his post as
      subpostmaster

    • Events log produced by the Post Office centrally, summarising which individuals are
      working on the Horizon system, and when the various reports were produced within
      the branch -- for weeks 3952 inclusive

      I understand from ray telephone
                                   aze conversation with you that this amount was input manoaily°
      under instructions from Horizon technical support which probably explains the difference of
      50p from the previously mentioned sure of £3,509.18.

      If the sun of £33,509,68 is indeed the same entry as the sum of £3,509.18 recorded in g I
