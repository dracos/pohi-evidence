Subject: Croxton Kerrial PO - Subject To Legal Privilege
Jarnail,

I've received the following enquiry, how should we approach this;

Chris Knight contacted me to let me know that a Barrister prosecuting a CPS case had asked about
Horizon issues. The case concerns a ‘fake’ robbery by the former Subpostmaster (defendant - Player) at
Croxton Kerrial Post Office. The robbery amount was £3,200.00 and a subsequent audit identified a
£650.00 loss in the branch (£3.85k loss in total). The Barrister had heard about faults in Horizon via the
press and asked Chris if the Post Office were satisfied that there were no faults with the audit or whether
the case he is prosecuting would be affected by Horizon integrity. Chris asked the Barrister to google 2™
Sight and he could see the reports findings. Chris is meeting with the Barrister this week re other evidential
matters and if the Barrister wants more Horizon information or to talk to someone about Horizon issues,
Chris will put him in contact with you, or Martin Smith in your absence.
