Hi SecOps,

I`ve had a query from POL. regarding some data extracts that have been run for CT1.231. 'Security Analytics- data
extracts'. The question they have is if they (PoL./Detica) identify some transaction types to be suspicious and want to
investigate / analyse those further, what would we require from POL/Detica to get the data corresponding to those
particular transaction types for a period which extends beyond last 62 days?

Pete Jobson thought that POL have a contracted limit of audit queries that are "pre-paid" and that if they exceed this
limit then they have to negotiate for more. Are you able to confirm what the agreed BAU process is?

Many Thanks,

Zara Brooke

I think that the answer to these questions is:

      1)    Me or Gareth Jenkins — I may be on hots for the last week June and 15` week July
      2)    Raj Bains and Andy Dunks (SecOps team) are responsible or Audit extracts. You will have to check with them.
            My understanding is that POL have a contracted limit of audit queries that are "pre-paid" and that if they
            exceed this limit then they have to negotiate for more. I think they have quite a few left in the bag this year
            so they should be ok. Speak to the SecOps team to find out what the agreed BAU process is.

In addition, you need to poke Saurabh as to when he wants his next extract — remember it needs setting up early — I
may be on hols for the last week June and 15` week July

Hi Zara,

I have a couple of things that I need to discuss.

      1)     Detica clarification queries: We identified as part of CR that there would be some queries from Detica after
             they have had a chance to look at the data extracts provided to them. Could you please let me know how and
             to whom to raise these queries? If I need to set up a conference call, whom do I need to invite for the same?

      2)    Historic Data: It is understood that Fujitsu maintains 62 days worth data and the older data gets archived. I
            am aware that Fujitsu is able to track some cases for Post Office from the archived data. My query is if we
            have identified some transaction types to be suspicious and want to investigate / analyse those further, what
            would you require from us to get the data corresponding to those particular transaction types for a period
            which extends beyond last 62 days.

Please do let me know if you need clarification on any of the points mentioned above.

Thanks & regards,
Saurabh
