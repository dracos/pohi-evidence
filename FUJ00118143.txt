1) A new paragraph 3.6 shall be added to Schedule G1 to the Codified Agreement as

follows:
3.6 Data Errors

3.6.1.1 Subject to.sub paragraph 3.6.3 below, ifthe Contractor discovers any error occurring
in transaction-records or.cash account stream-records other than the errors described
in sub paragraph 3.6.1.2 below (“Data Errors”) prior to the relevant record being
transmitted by the Contractor to POCL over the TIP Interface, the Contractor shall
not transmit the relevant record but shall retain it and promptly issue to POCL a
manual error report complying with sub-paragraph 3.6.2 below (a “Manual Error

Report”).
3.6.1.2 The following errors shall not be Data Errors:-

3.6.1.2.1 errors which are caused by invalid data input by Users in Outlets and are
not detected by the process introduced by the Accounting Integrity Control

Release;

3.6.1.2.2 errors caused by Reference Data (correctly applied by Pathway) which
preclude transactions from being correctly taken into account in the

subsequent cash account;

3.6.1.2.3 Cash accounts which are incomplete by reason of erroneous Reference
Data provided by POCL.

3.6.2. Each Manual Error Report shall include a full specification of the relevant record
following correction of the Data-Error (the “Repaired Data”), in a format suitable for

POCL to key into a POCL Data input facility.

Electronic Submission of Repaired Data

3.6.3 If in any cash account week the number of Data Errors exceeds 50 the provisions of
paragraph 3.6.1.1 above shall not apply in respect of Data Errors occurring in that

cash account week (except to the extent that Manual Error Reports shall already have

been submitted to POCL). In that event the Contractor shall, unless otherwise agreed
by POCL:

a) withhold the relevant record;

b) correct the relevant Data Error; and

c) submit the relevant record containing the Repaired Data for electronic

transmission over the Data Interface.

Where a Data Error shall not have been discovered prior to transmission of the
relevant transaction record but is subsequently discovered by the application of a
weekly checking process (such Data Error being hereafter referred to as a “Weekly
Data Error”) the provisions of paragraph 3.6.3 above shall not apply to such Weekly
Data Error. Instead such Weekly Data Error shall (subject to paragraph 3.6.6 below)
be dealt with by the issue of a Manual Error Report as specified in paragraph 3.6.1.1
above notwithstanding that the total number of Data Errors in the relevant week may
have exceeded 50.

If the number of Weekly Data Errors exceeds twenty in any week the Contractor
shall, in consultation with POCL, review the process introduced by the Accounting
Integrity Control Release with a view to enhancing such process in order to detect the
relevant Data Errors prior to transmission of the relevant data and to identify and

correct root causes of such Data Errors.

If the number of Weekly Data Errors exceeds fifty in any week POCL shall be entitled
to require the Repaired Data relating to such Weekly Data Errors to be dealt with in
accordance with sub paragraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 3.6.3 and not paragraph
3.6.4.

The Contractor undertakes that it will apply on a daily basis those checks required by
the TIP Control CCD to be so carried out and that all Data Errors discovered thereby
will then be dealt with in accordance with sub-paragraph 3.6.1.1 or 3.6.3 as

appropriate.

The Contractor undertakes that the delay between the occurrence of a Data Error (or

in the case of a Weekly Data Error, its detection) and the notification of the Repaired
FUJ00118143

FUJ00118143

Data to POCL (either by manual error report or electronically pursuant to paragraph
3.6.3 above) shall not exceed five working days.

3.69 Where the Contractor ‘is required to make-an assumption in order to correct a Data
Error and/or present Repaired Data, the Contractor shall make such assumption and

promptly inform POCL of the assumption made.

3.6.10 The Contractor.shall pay to POCL 30 days after the end of each month-a sum to
compensate POCL for its costs in dealing with Manual Error Reports equal to £150
per Data Error discovered after transmission of the relevant data and £100 per other

Data Error occurring in the cash account weeks ending during that month:

Other Discrepancies

3.6.11 The Contractor shall, following discovery of any discrepancy of the nature described
in paragraph 3.6.1.2.2 or 3.6.1.2.3 above, promptly issue a report to POCL containing
a brief description of the discrepancy and shall co-operate with POCL to investigate

and resolve such discrepancy.

CR/ACD/376 Version 0.9 Dated 234 September 1999); paragraph 5.3.3. thereof shall
be amended as appropriate to be consistent with the provisions of Clause 1 of this
