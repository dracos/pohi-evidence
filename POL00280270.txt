Subject: Confidential and privileged

Ben, I have been made very uncomfortable by an issue at Little Milton Post Office
approached me recently because they had been asked to pay a significant amount (£3-4k) to us. Kim Abbots
got involved but could not explain what had happened remotely. At my suggestion an audit was held and
the belief now seems to be that there was no loss, just mis-booking of stock and mi-remming of cash.
However, Kim has not yet been able to explain things to my satisfaction.

Could you please work with Kim while I am away to understand what has happened and answer two
questions.

1. Is our understanding of what is happening in branch sufficient for us to be able to ask for money or
suspend Postmasters — it doesn’t feel like it.
2. Secondly, should there be any implications for our defence of the GLO.

Given our shareholder’s focus on a rapid settlement, I would rather you looked at these questions without it
being clear I am asking — I haven’t used the whistleblowing process to protect privilege but I am asking for
that confidentiality and protection. You do not therefore have my permission to discuss this elsewhere,
other than talking to Kim about the specifics.

Is that OK?

Kind regards Al
