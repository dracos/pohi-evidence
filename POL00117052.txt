Thanks for sending this to me. This is what always happens. But we need to tell some home truths this time and I
will (and have).

Really appreciate the heads up.

Gavin
I hope the attached helps.

I'm afraid that I fundamentally disagree on Part Two. I am sure it is being written to support litigation
against us. But I have tried to cover Paula’s point below in the update note. And Mark has offered his
view.

Let me know if you need anything further

Ho Gavin, or even Hi Gavin!

Could you make sure the above has a bullet on the SS Report and how we plan to
welcome, respond, comment, use it to show the progress we have made on the
themes it will cover, etc. At the last discussion, Mark and some of the team were of
the view that we should try and stop it. Both Alice and I believe that would be
unhelpful and play into the (false) narrative about secrecy etc.

Thanks, Paula
