Rachel,

lam concerned at the engagement approach being taken here, we are fully on board to support but all approaches must
come through Post Office by the correct change process.

If this needs clarifying, please let me know and we can steer you to the right people.

Rachel,
Can’t you use the report | have already sent you? There is no mention of the case on the report.
You should really be addressing such requests through Post Office Ltd rather than directly to myself.

As far as | know there is no commercial cover in place for me to spend any time on such activities (and that includes the
case of Nemesh Patel).

Regards

Dear Gareth

Re: Horizon expert report

As you may already be aware, your expert report detailing the reliability of the Horizon system has
been served as evidence in a number of Post Office cases that are at various stages of the court
process, most of which are listed for trial in the early part of next year.

It should be noted that to date, most, if not all cases raising the Horizon system as an issue, have been
unable/not willing to particularise what specific issues that they may have with the system, and how
that shapes the nature of their defence.

As we already have your detailed report, I would like to serve it in each case listed below. All of the
following cases have raised issues with the reliability of the Horizon system:

1. Jamie Dixon Trial date - TBC

2. Khayyam Ishaq 25th Feb 2013 trial at Bradford Crown Court

3. Angela Sefton & Anne Neild 21st Jan 2013 trial at Liverpool Crown Court
4. Nemesh Patel 14th Jan 2013 trial at Peterborough Crown Court

5. Kim Wylie 17th December 2012 trial at Newcastle Crown Court

6. Grant Allen 10th December 2012 for PCMH at Chester Crown Court

Your expert report has already been served in the Nemesh Patel case. I would like to serve your
report in the remaining cases and have attached a case summary of each case listed above so that you
may familiarise yourself with the facts of each case.

I would like to stress that I do not anticipate that all of the above cases will reach trial stage. Please
could you read the case summaries attached, and send 5 original signed and dated copies of your
report to me as soon as possible.

POL-0096721

POL00097138

Jam conscious that there are a couple of cases coming up in December. In order for me to serve your
report in time, please could you either send the copies of your reports via special delivery and/or as
an email attachment.

If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me

Kind regards

Rachael
