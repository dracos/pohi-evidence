Hi Tracy,

Just checking that is 6 months extension from the original proposal which was due to end in December rather than 6
months from today?

Thanks

Paul

Hi Lesley,
Hope you had a good Easter weekend.

I sent a message to Leena this morning advising that we have agreed to extend her exceptional payment for a further 6
months, at which point we will review again. I think that seems reasonable.

Leena hasn’t responded to my message yet but I don’t see any reason why you can’t visit, as long as we are all aligned
on the proposed way forward.

Many thanks,

Tracy

Hi Lesley,

To confirm our discussion earlier today that we will continue payment up to and including the end of June and cease it
thereafter. Either you or Debbie will communicate that to Leena and also raise the subject of the opening hours
discrepancy.

Thanks

Hi Paul,

I support your view that the payment should be stopped. Giving fair notice of two months would be wise and I
agree that we need to get the communications right.

I shall make sure that Lee Taylor and Pete Marsh are aware of the upcoming change and potential for a
complaint.

Hopefully, Jayne (?) will be able to provide the written evidence of the original agreement. That was before my
time, so I don’t have anything, I’m afraid.

Kind regards,

Lesley

Hi All,

See below, the exceptional payment at Yateley is up for review. It is currently at iG er month and was only ever
promised for 6 months on the condition that the branch extended its opening hours from 3pm up to 5.30pm each
weekday and from 9-12 on Saturdays.

The data on iMaps suggests that they are open to 5pm now on weekdays (better than they were but not what was
asked) and still not open on Saturdays.

1am therefore minded to withdraw the payment (happy to go for another 2 months to give them fair notice), but
wanted a view from those on the ground first please.

Thanks

Paul

Hi Paul,

Further to our conversation this is what I think the current situation is:-

Processed for June (8 days) - ft

Amount due for full period of June is

Balance due §_ _! (Bacs ready for this amount)

In addition: -

3 months notice for the outreaches currently 3 visits /12 hours

( Bacs payment to be adjusted)

Goodwill payment for inconvenience -

(Bacs to be drawn up)

Ongoing Exceptional Premium payment - f° ‘4 1** July — 31% Dec to support staff costs for branch to remain open.

(Set up in CFS)

I think we are going to open her record and remove Ramesh’s name so that the history of this case is capture within the
record.

Speak to you at 2pm

Hi Paul,

These were the issues that Leena mentioned to Sheinaze yesterday when she spoke to Leena. Assume these will all be
covered by the additional payments you’ve detailed below but worth checking.

Pay issues raised diet Sheinaze today.
.

believes the missing amount is the NT premium payment which hasn’t been paid as part of the notice.
e Leena also stated she’s missing 2-day sessions for the outreaches; the amount was not clarified.

Thanks,

Tracy

Hi All,

Just wanted to give an update on discussions this morning around the postmaster bereavement situation at Yateley.

The plan is that Sheinaze will be calling Leena (the postmistress) at 4.30 this afternoon at which point we should have a
complete package put together to walk her through. As it stands I expect this to be made up of the following
components:

1. Aone-off payment to cover any missing payments that resulted from the contract being terminated early

2. Aone-off payment to cover the three month notice period that has now been served on the 3 outreaches that
the branch had previously been servi

3. Aone-off goodwill payment of £GRO!

4. An exceptional payment for the next 6 months of £989! per month to cover the cost of a part-time member of
staff for 3pm-5.30pm each weekday afternoon and 9am-midday on Saturdays. This will be conditional on the
branch re-opening for those hours (it’s currently closed during those hours).

Sarah is currently working on the breakdown of the payments for 1 and 2 above. Sarah, Sheinaze and I will then get
together this afternoon to ensure that Sheinaze has everything she needs for the conversation at 4.30

If anyone has any further suggestions or questions on this then please feed them through this group in good time
Kind Regards

Paul
