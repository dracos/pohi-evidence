6.2 UKGI risk appetite statement

The Board discussed the risk appetite paper in detail and agreed that the last paragraph of the
paper was too broad and needed to be extended further to re-define what is meant by
reputational risk and to include the UKGI KPIs and objectives.

Action: for the CFO to re-phrase the final statement of the risk appetite paper to include UKGI’s
KPls and objectives. The paper should then be sent back to the Board for approval.

Following the Board meeting the risk appetite was amended and the revised risk appetite
statement, stated below, was approved by the Board.

operational, execution and reputational risks. In those circumstances where it may be
necessary to take some risk in order to deliver the organisational objectives, UKGI will rely upon
its governance structure to mitigate risk.

Risk will be monitored and controlled by systematic review by the Board, by the Executive
Committee, by the Risk & Audit committee and through a regular review of the risk register. In
