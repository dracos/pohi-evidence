Hi Andy,

David Cavender has had discussions with David Neuberger and Tony Grabiner, both of whom have made
suggestions for the substantive appeal of the Common Issues Judgment. He needs my help on the Grounds
and Skeleton Argument for that appeal.

I think I am better deployed on that than I am on Horizon, at the moment at least. I can pass my sections of
the closing to Rebecca and Simon on Monday, if that is what we think best. Tony may be disappointed, but 2
juniors should be enough given the relaxed timescale.

Can you sort this out so that I can start in earnest on Monday, please?

Best,

Owain
