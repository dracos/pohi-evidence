I have been employed by Post Office Ltd for 25 years. For the last 10 years, I have undertaken
the role of Branch Auditor. The purpose of this role is to verify the assets held at Post Office
Branches are correct and that the transactions are performed to the required specification to
ensure the security of the Post Office assets, it's customers and it's clients.

On Wednesday 31* May 2006, I arrived at North Bransholme Post Office, accompanied by my
colleague Lyn Eastwood to undertake an audit at the branch. Diane Hoyles, Area Intervention
Manager and Janet Skinner, Subpostmisstress were present.

The cash was checked and was found to be short by £58,942.41. There was also a shortage in
the stock element of £274.02. This made the total loss at the branch £59,216.43.

I informed Diane Hoyles of the total loss and also telephoned Diane Matthews, Investigations
Manager to inform of my findings.

I was informed by Diane Hoyles that the branch would not be reopening and that all the cash
and stock would have to be despatched from the branch. I remmed the items off the Horizon
system and placed them in pouches for onward despatch.

I obtained a one shot password, which allows me to place the shortage into the
Subpostmisstress's late account. The amount of £59,216.43 was posted at this time.
