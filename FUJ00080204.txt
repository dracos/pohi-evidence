1 Introduction

Peak is a browser-based software incident and defect management system. It is the Helpdesk system
used by Post Office Account (POA) Third and Fourth Line Support Units. It enables diagnostic details to
be captured in a searchable format and allows the tracking of problems from detection through to
resolution.

Peak was written in-house by the Software Support Centre (SSC) and is now supported by the Peak
Administrator and Development Staff.

2 Scope

This document is targeted at people trying to use the Peak call management system to:
* raise new Peak calls or incidents
e view/update Peaks
* route Peak calls
* manage evidence
e close Peak calls
* and much more
The purpose of this document is to serve as a user reference to accompany the Peak client interface.

The client application actually interfaces with an SQL database via several underlying tables and a
limited number of views. Technical details about related tables and files are not included in this User
Guide.

Peak administrative functions and specialist functionality for Release Management, Change
Management and Request Management are also beyond the scope of this document. These functions
can be found in the Main Menu page but only if you are a member of the relevant teams.

3 Outline of this Document

All the screen shots shown in this document are just examples. Peak is highly configurable so the same
screen may look slightly different or have different de/activated buttons for each user depending on their
role, browser and user configuration as defined in Preferences, etc.

Throughout this document, the same convention has been used to refer to buttons and screens/pages.
The page name is shown on the top left hand side of the screen and is referred to in this document in
italics whilst the buttons are shown in bold. So “Close Window in Call Details” means the Close
Window button in the Cai! Details page.

Usually, there is more than one way to get to the same function but the main methods are shown below.

1. Using menu driven commands under the main headings: File, Call, Options, Conference, Admin
and Help

2. Using shortcut keys
Shortcut keys only work on the Main Menu screen and only exist for a limited number of
functions. These are shown throughout this document within square brackets: “[ ]”.

3. Using the buttons in the Main Menu

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED

So, for example, to go to the Preferences screen, you can use one of the following methods:
1. Via menu, Options/Preferences
2. Via shortcut, press “p” (not “P”) whilst in the Main Menu.
3. Via Main Menu: Preferences button
The 4 main screens within Peak mentioned extensively throughout this document are:
e = Main Menu - series of buttons; many are duplicated in the drop-down menus
© Call List - displays a list of incidents; shows one line per call
e (Expanded) Call Details - displays the (expanded) details of a particular call
« Add Response - where you can add a response to a call

The best way to use this document is to familiarise yourself with the basics by reading the first 6 sections
of this document and then look up your specific function/screen/button/function via the Table of Contents

(§0.1).

Note that on many of the pages within Peak, if you hover over the buttons you can get tool-tips with
more help.

4 Getting Started with Peak

You will need access to the Fujitsu Corporate LAN, a browser and a username/password; which is.
supplied by the Peak Administrator.

Once you have all these elements, you may start using the Peak system immediately, as all the facilities
are available on HTML pages. Some users prefer to use the Java enhanced features offered but some
preparatory work is needed and this option is due to be phased out.

e Peak2 — Primary server
e Peak3 — Standby server

In the event of a fail-over, if Peak2 is still available, a redirect page will be put in place otherwise Peak
users will be e-mailed with the Peak3 URL.

4.1 Connecting to Peak from sites other than BRA01

If you are connecting to Peak from an external site (other than BRAO1) and it is taking a long time to
display the initial Peak Logon page or if Peak is just generally really slow then it may be due to slow
DNS name resolution.

The DNS name resolution from external sites to the Primary Peak servers is very slow and impacts all
requests. To remedy this, add the following entry into your c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\Hosts file:

<Peak2_IP_address> peak2.peak.fs.fujitsu.com

where <Peak2_IP_address> can be found in the FAQ page (within Peak via drop-down menu
Help/FAQ).

To speed up access to Peak from home, if you have broadband/ADSL then you should not need to make
any changes. But if you use a dial-up modem, we recommend that you use the AJAX grid and customise
your search to display only those fields that you are interested in (otherwise by default many superfluous
fields will be displayed).

4.2 Peak Support

The Peak Administrator is responsible all administrative functions that need to be done within the Peak
system, including

* creating/updating/deleting users, teams, products, product groups, releases, companies, etc.

« — restricting functionality so that only selected users/teams can raise new calls (for a limited set of
releases) or clone calls, etc.

Peak Development staff are responsible for supporting the live system and they are custodians of the
Peak Enhancement Register which is a Word document which details all the Peaks and verbal/e-mail
enhancement requests we have received.

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED

To contact Peak Support, please use one of the following methods:
1. Send an e-mail to the appropriate group mailbox:
for administration support (e.g. users, Peak routing, etc.)

for system support (e.g. bugs, enhancements, etc.)
2. Raise a new Peak call with the details and route it to the ‘Peak HelpDsk’ team.

4.2.1 User accounts

In order for a new user to be configured their Management must e-mail the Peak Administrator with the
following information:

e User's full name

e Fujitsu Personnel number

e Required permissions e.g. read only, normal or administrative
e Peak teams they should be a member of

4.2.2. Password rules
Peak passwords must adhere to the following rules:
e minimum length of 7 characters

e MUST contain at least one capital letter, lowercase letter and non-alphabetic character (digit or
special character such as *, %, #, etc.)

e last 6 passwords cannot be reused
Passwords will expire automatically after 50 days

New or locked users will be assigned a password by the Peak Administrator which must be changed at
first logon. Users also have the option to change their own password if they feel their existing one has
been compromised via the New password button in Main Menu (§20).

4.2.3 Lifecycle of Peak calls

All Peak calls go through the following lifecycle and each call must pass through each stage in turn:

e Open Initial state of a Peak call

« Pending Incident is being investigated

e Final Investigations have finished —Final response is sent back for approval
e Closed Final state — call is closed on the Peak system.

Peak will enforce this call lifecycle so it will not allow a Final response to be entered unless the current
status is Pending and a call cannot be Closed until its status is Final.

Once an incident is closed, it will remain, at least, on the Peak database (it is not archived or deleted) so
you should be able to search on calls going back to the switch-over from PinICL to Peak.

4.2.4 Role Permissions

A role is assigned to each Peak user which determines what that user is allowed to do on Peak; which
affects which screens and buttons are dis/enabled for that user. Most Peak users belong to the ‘No
administrative role’ which has permissions to do the following (usually dependent on the status of the call
and which team the call is assigned to):

Edit Call Type (Status=Open, Pending or Final) and (Assigned to user’s team)
Edit Summary (Status=Open, Pending or Final) and (Assigned to user’s team)
Edit Subject Product (Status=Open, Pending or Final) and (Assigned to user's team)
Edit root cause (Status=Open, Pending or Final) and (Assigned to user's team)

Add Progress (Status=Open, Pending or Final) and (Assigned to any team

Edit Reference (Status=Open, Pending, Final or Closed) and (Assigned to any team)
Add Reference (Status=Open, Pending, Final or Closed) and (Assigned to any team)

Edit Product (Status=Open or Pending) and (Assigned to user's team)
Add Product (Status=Open, Pending, Final or Closed) and (Assigned to any team)

Edit Evidence (Status=Open, Pending or Final) and (Assigned to user's team)
Add Evidence (Status=Open, Pending, Final or Closed) and (Assigned to any team)

Raise new call

Route call (Status=Open, Pending or Final) and (Assigned to user’s team)
Action call (Statu: pen or Pending) and (Assigned to user's team)
Clone call (Status=Open, Pending or Final) and (Assigned to user’s team)
Send Final (Status=Open, Pending or Final) and (Assigned to user’s team)

The ‘No administrative role’ is not allowed to change the Target Release, Priority, Contact, Close calls,
Send over OTI, Reopen calls or Enter SQL in Query Builder.

If your role has been set up incorrectly, please contact the Peak Administrator.

4.2.5 Locked user accounts

If a Peak user fails to log in after 3 attempts, the account is locked and the user will get the following
warning:

Windows Internet Explorer

d Account reset Following 3 Failed logan attemps, Peak will automatically email you a new password,

Fig.4.2.5: Locked account warning

Peak will then automatically reset the password and send an e-mail containing the new password to the
mailbox of the registered owner of the user account.

4.2.6 New Products and Product Groups

If you have searched the existing products/product groups and feel that a new one is required, e-mail the
Peak Administrator with the following information:

New Product

« Product Name

e Existing Product Group

e Owning Peak Team
New Product Group

e Product Group Name

e Description

e Product Family

e Owning Peak Team

* Contact Point

4.2.7. Companies

This is an enhanced security feature of the Peak system. It restricts people from different companies
(Infinite, SSC Website users and POA Joint Testing) looking at or searching for each other's incidents.
The rules for viewing incidents are:

e Any incident a team in a user’s company has raised
e Any incident assigned to a team in a user’s company
e System administrators may view any incident

If you are routed a call, you can place an Action on your team/yourself (see §8.21) which will continue to
make that call visible to you even though it is routed back to the originating company. Correspondingly,
if you add sensitive information or evidence to a call which has an action on a different company, these
details will a/so be visible to that company.

4.3 Sources of Peak Calls
Three main sources can create Peak calls: They can be created by:

* external Helpdesks (e.g. TRIOLE for Service, TS)
(aka Customer calls/OTI calls/OTI Provider calls)
Once the Helpdesk have determined that the problem is software and gathered evidence, the
call details (along its TfS call reference) are sent across OTI interface to raise a new Peak call.

* Quality Centre (QC) system
(aka Test or QC calls/non-OTI calls)
QC is the defect handling system used by the Test Teams which can raise new calls on Peak.

«Peak itself
(aka Internal calls/non-OT1 calls/OTI Consumer calls)
These types of calls can be routed around the Peak system or sent to external Helpdesks like
Tfs.

4.3.1 TRIOLE for Services (TfS)

TRIOLE for Services (TfS) is the Helpdesk system used by Post Office Account (POA) First and Second
Line Support Units to capture incident details raised by Branches, Post Office Limited and the NBSC
(similar in function to Peak).

Each TfS incident has a unique call reference (e.g. TfS 3195922) which is an incrementing integer
however this is used for other internal references other than Incidents so can not be used as a count of
the total incidents raised.

4.3.2 Open-Systems Teleservice Interface (OTI)

The Open-Systems Teleservice Interface (OTI) is the interface specification used to send call details
between Helpdesk systems. Primarily this is used to receive incidents from TfS into the Peak system
and transfer progress details back from Peak to the originating Helpdesk and vice versa.

Initially when an OTI call is received on Peak, it is routed to the OTI Administrator team (currently the
SSC) and has a status of Pending and ‘Call Logger:_Customer Call_ -- EDSC’. The OT! Team is tasked
with checking the integrity of incoming OTI calls and then routing them on to the relevant Peak
teams/stacks or to QFP (§8.20.1) — this activity is known as “prescanning’.

All updates or responses will be sent back over the OT] to update the originating Helpdesk; except for
‘Progress Only’ updates. It should take 2 minutes for Peak updates to appear on their TfS call and for
TfS updates to appear on their Peak call.

Note that the maximum size of response that TfS can cope with is 4Kb so be aware that because of this
limit when sending responses back across the OTI the TfS update may be truncated.

Once the OTI call has a Final response from a non-OTI enabled team, the incident will be routed back to
the OTI Administrator team to check the integrity of the closure response before closing the call on
Peak; which sends the final response back across the OTI and passes ownership back to the originating
Helpdesk. The Helpdesk can then continue working on the call (checking back with the Branch, route the
call onto another Helpdesk, etc.) before closing the call on their system.

Note that whilst a Peak call is being investigated, the Helpdesk could accidentally close or withdraw the
associated OTI call. Withdrawing the OTI call will automatically change the associated Peak call status
from Pending to Closed. But closing the OTI call will not change the Peak call status so any updates
made on Peak will not be passed back across the OTI.

4.3.3 Quality Centre (QC)

The Quality Centre (QC) is the system used by the Test Teams to manage test scripts. When one of
these scripts fails, it is reviewed and if they believe the failure was due to a build or software defect they
can get QC to create a Peak incident.

Incidents from QC do not come via the OTI link. Initially, QC incidents are logged as being raised by
‘Call Logger: QC Peak Interface user’ in the ‘QC Interface’ team and routed to the QFP team/stack. If the
QC user is also a Peak user they will be shown as the ‘Call Logger’ instead. Any evidence will be
transferred from QC to the associated Peak (but not from Peak to QC).

Any new comments in QC are passed on to Peak and new progress in Peak is passed back to QC. QC
progress is stored in HTML; therefore all updates in Peak from QC will be presented as HTML. It takes
up to 10 minutes to transfer updates between the Peak and QC (via the QC interface).

When Peak investigation is complete and a Final Response is entered, the incident is routed back to the
QC Interface Team waiting closure agreement from QC. If a Final Response of ‘S/W Fix Released to
Call Logger’ is selected, the incident must have a Baseline reference of the fix otherwise the response
will be rejected by Peak.

If the QC users are happy with the response, they can agree closure and the Peak call will be is
automatically closed otherwise they can reject the closure and the call on Peak would become active
again. Peak users may not close a QC raised incident, only a closure agreement message from the QC
system can do this.

7 Displaying Call List — call list

The Cail List page enables you to view a list of existing calls — ranging from all open calls on a particular
stack/user to calls with a particular Reference.

On entry to the Cail List screen, the default query or the last query loaded is displayed. For new users,
the default query is set up by Peak but this can be changed via Query Builder (§11.1.5.1).

There are three versions of Call List (called Incident List in HTML) grid which can be configured via
Preferences (§13.7):

Fig.7c: Call List - AJAX version (with bottom row of buttons)
© Java

For more details see APPENDIX A: Java. But note that we are hoping to phase out this option so there
will be minimal references to it in this document so use this at your own risk.

At the very top of the HTML/DHTML and bottom of the AJAX/Java Call List screens, there is a row of
buttons containing some useful functions — most are described in the following sections otherwise they
can be found under the major section headings. There may also be a (second) row of buttons at the top
of Call List screen which show any customised queries that you have set up using Query Builder (§11) —
only the first 9 queries will be displayed in alphabetical order and the disabled query is the current query.

7.1 Full List/Sub Set (HTML/DHTML/Java)

These buttons will only be activated, if they are applicable. If no calls are selected, then both buttons will
be greyed out. As soon as at least one call is selected, Sub Set will be activated.

To view a subset of the displayed calls, select the subset (by using CTRL and clicking individual calls or
in HTML grid, tick the boxes) then select the Sub Set button. To return to the full list of calls, select Full
List.

7.2 Bulk Update (HTML/DHTML/Java)

This button will only be activated, if it is applicable. If no calls are selected, then the button will be greyed
out. As soon as least one call is selected, Bulk Update will be activated.

Bulk Update enables you to update a group of calls (maximum is 100 calls) with the same information in
one go. For example, if more than one call needs updating with the same type of details e.g. Summary,

Top Collection, Progress Text, you do this by:

» Click Bulk Update button to open up the Bulk Update form (which is similar to the New Call page)
where any changes will be applied to all the selected calls.

7.3 Change Layout (HTML) and Save Layout (DHTML/Java)
A lot of the column properties within the HTML/DHTML and Java Cail List can be customised and then
saved; there is no method to alter the layout of the AJAX grid.

To customise the HTML layout, select the Change Layout button to display a sub menu for resizing and
moving the columns in the grid then save any changes by pressing Save Layout or Cancel Layout.

To customise the DHTML and Java layout, this can be done within the Call List grid itself:

» To change the column width

Point the mouse at the dividing line on the right side of the column till the cursor changes to a
horizontal arrow “<>” then click the left mouse button and drag to the new preferred point and
release the mouse.

» To change the order of the columns
Click and drag each column across to the desired position

» To sort a selected column
Point and click the relevant column heading
Note that changing the sort order in this way will only affect the current display; the order is not
saved. If you wish to save a sort order, edit the query via Build Query (§11.1.8).

> To resize the window
Use standard Windows techniques with the mouse (this information is not saved as a preference)

» Then select the Save Layout button
Any layout changes you make will only apply to the current query.

If you create a new query by editing an existing query and saving it to a different name then the layout
will also be copied over from the original query.

To configure which column headings are actually displayed in the Cail List page, use Query Builder to
edit the ‘Display Fields’ within the relevant query (§11.1.9).

7.4 Refresh

This forces an immediate update of the data in the call grid to show any changes. There is an automatic
refresh timer and this can be set via Preferences (§13.5).

7.5 Copy (HTML/DHTML/Java)

You can use the Copy button to copy all the incidents in the Cail List (including headers) into the
clipboard as a tab-separated list which can then be pasted into e.g. an Excel spreadsheet which can then
be manipulated or printed (§14.1).

On the HTML Call List, IE5+ is required and it may take some time to copy a large grid, the information
will be available as soon as the Copy button is re-enabled.

7.6 XML (HTML/DHTML/Java)

The XML button will retrieve the call details for all incidents in the current Call List and display them on
one page; in a format similar to the Expanded view.

This page could then be printed using the browser print option; where each incident will start on a new
page.

This feature could be used to send copies of a Peak call or a list of incidents to someone by e-mail. To
do this, you need a compliant XML parser (IE6+):

» Create a call list to display all the incidents you wish to send.

» Press XML which will eventually open a new window showing the complete call defaults for each call
in the current query.

>» Use the File-Save feature of the browser to the save the XML file to local disk.

> Copy the style-sheet from the Peak share (\\peak2\share\PeakStyle3.xs!) to the same location as the
XML file. Open the XML file in a Text Editor and change the second line that points to the style-sheet
from:

<?xmi-stylesheet type="text/xsI" href:
to
<?xmi-stylesheet type="text/xsI" href="PeakStyle3.xsI"?>

> Now e-mail both files to the end user.

» If the recipient opens the XML file in a browser that complies with xslt standards (IE6 or Firefox), the
call details will be displayed.

7.7 Search Grid for Text (DHTML)

The Search Grid for Text button, which only appears in the DHTML grid, will search the call details of
all the incidents in the current Call List. If it finds an incident which contains your text anywhere within its
call details, it is highlighted in the Call List page.

The text near the top of this Cai! Details screenshot shows that this user has 8 Peak broadcasts “(8

unread)”, Clicking on the icon “M4” will take you back to the Main Menu to enable you to read or delete
any read messages (§29).

Updates to the call will appear in an area in the middle of the Cal! Details page called the Progress field.
If you click on the Expand button, you will be able to see the progress updates, references, collections
and Products listed on one page.

If a button background is orange, this means that at least one item has been are defined for this button.
For example, the screenshot above shows that there are some References, Collections and Evidence
associated with this particular call.

If a button has ellipses “(..)” after the name (e.g. Business Impact..) then another screen will be
displayed asking for more information but if the button name does not have ellipses (e.g. Route) then
that operation will just happen.

You can send someone a link to a specific call, so they will be taken straight to the Cai! Details page for
that call, by copving the relevant URL into the e-mail:

8.1 Call Reference

All Peak call references begin with “PC” followed by a 7-digit number which uniquely identifies each call.
The call number is assigned automatically when the Peak call is created.

The Call Reference for live incidents, that is those of ‘Call Type: L’, will appear in red in the HTML and
Java Call Lists (§7).

8.2 Call Logger

The ‘Call Logger’ field will contain the name followed by the team of the user who raised the call on
Peak. For customer calls, this team will be the OT! Administrator team (currently the SSC). For QC calls,
this field will contain the QC PEAK Interface team.

When a Final response is added to the call, it is automatically routed back to the Call Logger to approve
the response.

If you click the ‘Call Logger’ hyperlink, then a new e-mail template will be generated addressed to the
Call Logger with the subject “Query regarding Peak PCnnnnnnn you logged”.

8.3 OTI Provider call/OTI InTransit/OTI Down

You can determine the status of the OTI interface link (§4.3.2) by looking at the Cal/ Details of any OTI-
originated incident:

e OT Provider call shown if the OTI is up
° OTI Down shown if the OTI is down

The OTI up/down status is set on Peak manually by SSC when the OT! Administrator informs them of a
change in state (§21).

e = OT inTransit “=” shown briefly when a Peak is sent to an external Helpdesk (e.g. TfS) to
raise a new incident at that desk

e OTI Consumer shown when a Peak has been received by the external Helpdesk. It will
remain in this state until they send back a Final response.

If the status is stuck at OTI in Transit, then you can click on the icon “ >)" to retry the send to the external
Helpdesk.

8.4 Release

This field holds information related to releases pertaining to a particular Peak call:
e Reported In indicates which release the fault was found in
e Requested For indicates which release the fix should be applied
« Proposed For indicates which release the fix is proposed for

e Targeted At indicates which release the fix is targeted at — this can be changed throughout
the lifecycle of a call

e Released At indicates which release the fix was actually applied

Press the button with the ellipse icon “(...)” which is next to the ‘Release’ field to display the Releases
screen where you can view the release history, select a release type and release then Add it to this call.
If you have administrative privileges then the Delete button will be enabled for you to delete an existing
release. Generally, this field is set when the Peak is first created and is subsequently updated by
members of the Release Management team.

The fields under the headings ‘Description’, ‘Date Out Dev’, ‘Date Out PIT’, ‘Date Into Test’, ‘Date Out
Test’, ‘Date Out Live’ and ‘Deploy Groups’ are automatically filled in if you choose a release type of
‘Targeted At’ and select a release which has those properties associated with it; usually set up by
Release Management.

All roles may be set the ‘Reported In’ release but the ‘Targeted At’ option is only available to roles with
the Administrative privileges (§4.2.4).

8.5 Top Ref/References

References are used to relate resources of information to a call. These references may be used to
search and display a specific set of calls via Quick Search or Query Builder.

The References button will take you into the References page where you can Add Reference, Delete
existing references and nominate a Top Reference which will make that particular reference visible in
the ‘Top Ref’ field on top-level Cail List and Call Details pages.

To add a reference to an existing incident:
» Select the reference type from the ‘Add Reference Type’ drop-down list (e.g. ‘MSC’).

> If necessary, change the template for the reference type by using the ‘Expected Format’ drop-down
list (e.g. ‘043Jnnnnnnn’ and ‘043Jnnnnnnn-nn’).

>» Type in the ‘Reference Value’ — which must be of the ‘Expected Format’ - then Add Reference.

Many references are hyperlinks to external resources e.g. TfS calls, SSC KELs, MSC Tasks, Release
Notes, documents, etc. For example, if a call was raised on TfS, the TfS call reference would appear as
a hyperlinked top reference (like 3245056). Clicking on this link will take you directly to that particular call
in TfS but first you must set up your TfS login details via Preferences, see §13.24.

If you add a reference of type ‘Product Baseline’, next to the Add Reference button, the icon “”” will
appear. If you click this icon, you will be able to search then select from a list of current software
baselines by typing in a minimum of 4 characters.

Once the incident has been associated with more than one reference, the background to the References
button will turn orange in Cal! Details (as shown in Fig.8).

° etc.

When you raise new calls, it is possible to set the ‘Call Type’ field to default to a certain call type via
Preferences (§13.23). The ‘Call Type’ chosen may affect the list of priorities displayed in the drop-down
list. Similarly, if you subsequently change the ‘Call Type’ which means that the current priority is now
invalid, the ‘Priority’ will automatically change to the lowest possible priority.

8.7 Priority

Each call must have a priority associated with it. The priority levels start from “A” to “Z” with “A” being
the highest priority level and “Z” the least.

For example:
eo A business is stopped
° B business is restricted
» Cc non-critical
° D internal

Calls logged as “A” priority will be shown in red in the Cail List page (§7).
Priorities are originally set by the Call raiser and may be modified on Peak by authorised roles (§4.2.4).

When creating new calls, if ‘Default Logging Call Type’ was selected in Preferences (§13.23) then the
lowest priority available will be the default priority. Choosing a valid priority activates and populates the
‘Target Date’ and ‘Target Time’ fields at the bottom of the New Call screen.

Each new user will have a default alert (§17) to e-mail them if they are assigned an ‘A’ priority call.

Note that changing the priority on Peak will not automatically update the priority on the external helpdesk
if the call originated over OTI.

8.12 Business Impact

The ‘Impact’ should give a brief description of the perceived impact, in terms of cost and scope that the
incident is having on the customer or estate and is used by the Business Impact Forum (BIF) (§8.20.2).

An impact can be added, deleted or updated via the Business Impact button. After typing in the Impact

text, you can spell check the text by selecting “¥_” (§9.2), Clear Text (to remove the text you just typed
in), Delete (to delete an Impact), Restore (to revert back to the last saved text) or Save Changes.

Once added, the text of the Impact will appear in orange in the Cail Details page; the first 63 characters
(depending on the font) will initially be displayed but you can use the right-arrow key to see the first 80
characters. The full impact text can be seen in the Expanded view and printouts.

8.13 Summary

The ‘Summary’ field is used as the title of the call and can be amended as long as the call has not been
closed. You can amend this field by typing text immediately into the ‘Summary’ box then click on the
Save Summary button to commit the change.

The first 63 characters (depending on the font) of the ‘Summary’ field will initially be displayed in the Call
Details page but you can use the right-arrow key to see the first 100 characters. The full summary text
can be seen in the Expanded view and printouts.

The text in the ‘Summary’ field will appear greyed-out if the user’s role does not allow changes or if the
call is closed (§4.2.4).

8.14 Links to KEL (Known Error Log)

These 3 icons take you directly to the Known Error Log (KEL) via the SSC website (which uses identical
login credentials as the Peak system). See §28.1 for more details.

8.14.1 Search the KEL

The “#” icon enables you to search the KELs on the SSC Website for the best matching KEL for this
call after highlighting some text in the Progress Narrative. You will be taken into the SSC website to a list
of KELs that contain the highlighted text.

The icon “ a. gets Peak to suggest the best matching KEL given the existing symptoms in the call.
Peak will automatically select the important words from the first progress of the incident and then search
the KEL using these words. You will be taken into the SSC website to a list of the top 10 matches.

8.14.2 Create new HNG-X KEL

Clicking the icon “ * will create a new KEL after you highlight some text in the Progress Narrative
(which will appear in the ‘Symptoms’ of the new KEL). You will be taken into the SSC website “Create
HNGX KEL” page where the ‘KEL Title’ and ‘PEAK Call Ref’ have also been automatically populated
from the Peak call.

8.15 Progress

The area in the middle of the Call Details page is referred to as the Progress field. It displays a trail of
where the call has been (audit information) and previous updates made to the call. Two background
colours can be configured via Preferences to distinguish between different Progress updates (§13.13).

The text displayed in this area is read only; not editable and can contain links to References, evidence,
user details/teams/admin and embedded HTML.

To see an expanded view of all the Progress Narratives (without the scrollable area) use the Expand
button.

8.15.1 User Details

In the Progress Narrative, if the user's name appears (usually after an update) as a hyperlink then by
clicking it you can find out more information about that user such as phone number, e-mail, teams they
are members of and admin details.

user and with the ‘Subject’ field pre-populated with the text: “Peak Incident PCnnnnnnn’.

If the user name does not appear as a hyperlink then that user has since left the Company and been
removed from Employee database.

8.16 Root Cause

The ‘Root Cause’ field is visible only from Cal Details page. As a standard user, the root cause can be
changed only if the call is on your Team's stack (§4.2.4). A ‘Route Cause’ must be specified before the
call can be closed.

8.17 Collections

A Collection is a group of related calls. All the calls within a Collection can then be retrieved by building
a query using the collection name (e.g. Collection - Equal To - <Collection_name>, see §11.1 for
details).

If the incident has been associated with least one collection, the background to the Collections button
will turn orange in Call Details (as shown in Fig.8).

First a Collection must be defined (as described in §16) then incidents can be associated with (and then
removed from) that Collection by pressing Collections:

=e secie Tiana eASET an
Fig.8.17: Call associated with 2 Collections

If there are any Collections already associated with the call then it will be shown in the top section of this
screen (as shown in the Fig.8.17).

To add the call to an existing Collection, select the collection name from the ‘Add Incident to Collection’
drop-down list then Add to Collection which will then create an entry in the top section of the screen.
Note that the ‘Add Incident to Collection’ drop-down list will only display Collections which you have
permissions to update i.e. all public collections, your own privately created collections and your team’s
private collections

To remove this call from a Collection, press Delete on the relevant Collection line. The Delete button will
only be enabled if you are the user who added the incident to the Collection or the Collection owner,
otherwise it will be disabled.

You can also make a collection the top collection (which means that it will be displayed in the Cal! List if
the ‘Top Collection’ column is configured), press the Set Top on the relevant Collection line. Note that
the Set Top button will only be visible if this call belongs to more than one collection.

You could define a new Collection via this Collections page by pressing the Edit Collections button
which will take you straight into the Collections definitions with a blank Collection (§16). Or you could
edit one of your own Collections by selecting the name via the ‘Add Incident to Collection’ drop-down list
and then pressing Edit This Collection. Note that if you will be shown a blank Collection if you select a
Collection that you did not create.

8.18 Show/Hide Audit

The Progress field can hold progress text (responses added by users) and audit information (such as Call
Type, Root Cause, References, Routing, etc.); which are effectively changes to all call attributes other
than progress text.

You can adjust what is shown in the progress field by using the button which toggles between Show
Audit and Hide Audit. Use Show Audit to view more than just the narrative text and Hide Audit to
display progress only (no admin information). This toggle will then affect all calls viewed via Cal! Details.

Note that toggling the Show/Hide Audit buttons will affect the ‘Initial Audit View ON’ field on the
Preferences page (§13.10) and vice versa, and also the Expanded view.

8.19 Add Response to a call

See §9.

8.20 Routing call to another team/user

Calls on Peak can be transferred between teams and within teams to individuals by first changing the
‘Routing Team’ and/or ‘Routing User’ fields (using the drop-down lists) then pressing the Route button.
The default value is the currently assigned team and user. Users with the standard role may only route
Open calls that are assigned to one of their teams.

If you know the user you want to route a call to but do not know which team(s) they are a member of,

you may search for a user by pressing the ellipse button “(...)” which is next to the ‘User name’ field. This
will display the “Choose a user” pop-up window that lists all the valid Peak users. Under ‘Select User’,
choose the name you are looking for and then ‘Select Team’ will be populated with any teams that they
are members of. Choose the appropriate team and press OK to copy these details back into your original
form or Cancel.

Usually you will be able to route calls directly to individuals within a team. However team restrictions can
be set up by the Peak Administrator, to prevent the routing of calls directly to members of a team.
Instead the call will be routed to the “_Unassigned_” user within that team. This set-up is applies for calls
routed to the EDSC, when a Prescanner within the SSC is responsible for routing all new unassigned
calls to individual users.

Note that in the Cail! Details page, only the short name of the ‘Routing Team’ are displayed. But if you
have IE7 or later, if you hover over the team name in the drop-down list a tool-tip will appear with the full
team name.

8.20.1 QFP Team

The Quality Filter Process (QFP) team is the gateway into Systems Integration (SI) for non-S! teams, so
all calls must be routed to this team for progressing by any SI team.

The members of the QFP are representatives of all the SI! design/development units. Allied to the QFP
Team is the QFP Forum which has a role similar to the Release Management Forum (RMF) but which
authorises the release of fixes into baseline releases, rather than the live estate. For more details see

document reference DE/PRO/015.

8.20.2 BIF Team

The Business Impact Forum (BIF) team is the initial review body for incidents raised by the live estate.
They meet daily to discuss all Peaks on their stack and decide, depending on the business impact,
whether a fix is justified. If it is not then the call is closed with a KEL otherwise the call will be routed
through to Development to investigate and provide a fix is required. This relies upon Business Impact
statements (§8.12) from the support and Development teams.

If an incident is urgent, it may by-pass the BIF team straight to Development but this should be stated in
the Business Impact.

First change the Routing Team (and User) fields to the relevant team and user that you want to place an
action on and then press Action.

Once the incident has an action defined, the Action button toggles to Remove Action, the button
background changes to orange in Cail Details and the actioned team is displayed above the button (e.g.
“Action on xOSR_GDC’” as shown in Fig.8.21).

This will cause the actioned user/team to see this call in assigned queries as if it is on their stack but the
call is not actually assigned to them. By default, you will not get an alert if call is actioned on you but this
can be configured via Alerts (§17).

Once the tasks related to that call have been completed, you can Remove Action.

Note that if you action a team in another Company then that will allow them to access the call (§4.2.7).

8.22 Subject Product

Each Peak call must be related to at least one product. If the incident has been associated with more
than one product then the background to the Products button will appear orange in the Call Details.

The first product associated with a call is automatically designated the default ‘Subject Product’ which
means that it will appear in the Call Details page. To change the default product, click the relevant
Subject button in the Products form.

Note you will not be allowed to modify the Products if your role does not have the necessary privileges
(§4.2.4). Consequently the middle section of the screen (as shown in the Fig.8.22) will only be visible for
privileged roles to add a product to a call:

» If you know the product group and product then select a ‘Product Group’ which will then
automatically populate the ‘Product’ drop-down list with only relevant products, then click Add
Product.

Or

> If you only know the product (but not the product group) or you wish to see a list of all the available
products then use Find Product. Start typing the product name into the ‘Product name search’ field
and the products matching the text you entered will be displayed. Click the relevant Select Product
button and this product/group will be copied into the Products page, then select Add Product.

If the product cannot be found then you can ask Peak to add it by clicking the ‘Request a new product’
link which will generate a new e-mail template addressed to Peak with the subject “Product request”.

The Build Chunk, Deployment Group, Live, LST, SV&I headings are the release (deployment) groups
and the rigs supporting the platform. If the ‘Product Group: HNG-X Platforms’ is selected then these
fields will be automatically populated. This information was imported from the Platform Hardware
Instance List (PHIL) document.

8.23 Expanded call details

The Call Details page displays limited progress text, to view the progress full-screen (without the
scrollable area), click the Expand button to get an expanded view.

8.23.1 To save call as a file

The Expanded Call Details page is similar to the Print view and from this page, you can save the call to a
HTML file:

>» From the Explorer File menu, select “Save As”.
> Inthe “Save Webpage” information box, respond Yes to saving webpage.

The ‘Assignee’ field shows you who the call is currently assigned to. The user name and team are
concatenated and displayed in this read-only field. A call can be assigned to only one user at any one
time (whilst the action may be placed on another user).

Clicking on the hyperlink in the ‘Assignee’ field will generate a new e-mail with the ‘To’ e-mail field
populated with the full e-mail address of the assignee as well as the ‘Subject’ field populated with the
text: “Query regarding Peak PCnnnnnnn you have assigned”.

8.25 Clone a call

Pressing the Clone button will create a duplicate Peak call and display it in the Call Details page. The
clone will look exactly like the original (including all progress history and references) except for the
following:

Call Reference The clone will have its own unique Peak call reference
Call Logger Name of the Cloner and their default team
Top Ref A reference to the master call is made the top reference.

Similarly in the master call, the cloned call is made the top reference.
Most of the original references are removed other than those to external

systems.
Call Type “C — Cloned call”
Contact Name of the Cloner
Status ‘Pending — Potential Problem Identified’
Progress Some details about the creation date, time and user of the cloned call are added

at the top, before the progress history from the master call.
An update showing that this call was cloned, the original call reference and

“ser are appended to the end of the original progress. Similarly the cloned call
reference will be appended to the end of the master call.

Routing The clone is automatically routed to the Cloner’s default team and username.

Assignee Name of the Cloner and their default team concatenated together.

Evidence Links to all the evidence items are copied across

Two separate incidents will then exist on Peak (with different call references) which can be dealt with
independently. Call cloning only takes place on Peak so if the call originated from the OTI link, a
duplicate call will not be created on e.g. TfS.

Usually you will be able to clone calls however team restrictions can be set up by the Peak
Administrator, to prevent all members of a team from cloning calls. If you wish this feature to be
enabled/disabled for your team, first check with the Team manager then contact the Peak Administrator.

Note that you may clone closed calls but only if your Peak role allows you to do so (§4.2.4).

Generally, to add a file as evidence to a Peak call:

>» Inthe Evidence page, type in the ‘Source File Name’ (which is a mandatory field denoted by the
orange background) or use the Browse button to display the standard Microsoft Windows “Choose
file” window to locate your file then click Open.

v

(Optional) If Peak has not correctly filled in the ‘File Type’ or ‘Compression Type’ then update these
fields.

> Type in a ‘Description’ of the type of file or evidence attached (mandatory)
The ‘Description’ field will used in the hyperlink text in the Progress Narrative; which if clicked can be
used to open the evidence item.

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED

> (Optional) Choose the ‘Source OS’ (Operating System).

» Click Add Evidence to include the chosen file to the call, the new evidence is added to the list of
evidence at the top of the page.

When an evidence file is uploaded, it is given a unique internal name starting with the Peak call
reference and ending with its character extension (e.g. PC0101234_123456.doc). Therefore when you
open the evidence item, Windows will know which program to use to open it. But if you choose
Download, the file will be saved using its original file name.

Compressed files can be added to calls but only if they do not need to be obfuscated.

8.26.1.1 Encryption of evidence
Peak can be used to handle secure data by encrypting data which is uploaded as evidence.

Selecting the ‘Encrypt file’ option will update the Progress text to log that a file has been placed in the
encryption queue. The encryption job runs every 10 minutes and will compress the file, convert it into a
Self-Decrypting Archive (SDA), add the evidence item and update the Progress text with a random pass-
phrase (minimum of 10 characters) along with a link to the encrypted data.

If encryption fails for any reason, the file will not be made available to download, the Call Progress will
be updated with a short error message and the User who added the evidence will be sent an e-mail.

Once available, another Peak user will be able to download the encrypted (*.EXE) file and enter the pass-
phrase to decrypt and access the data.

For additional security, encrypted files are deleted 28 days after the call is closed.

The software used to create the SDA is open source software AxCrypt which encrypts using AES-128
File Encryption.

8.26.1.2 Obfuscation of evidence

Before evidence containing personal/sensitive data can be passed to external Peak Companies (like the
Fourth Line Offshore Support team in India GDC) it must first be obfuscated. To ensure this happens,
the Obfuscation Tool has been integrated into the Evidence page.

The following files must be obfuscated before being sent offshore:
* counter PostOfficeCounter log
* counter message log
e BAL message log
e database exports
Files not listed above (e.g. BAL OSR logs) do not require obfuscation and may be attached in full.

Each file type has its own list of patterns that it is checking for, so you MUST select the correct type of
file (e.g. ‘BAL Message Log’) after selecting ‘File Type=Obfuscated File’ and/or ticking ‘Obfuscate file’. If
the wrong file type is selected, the incorrect pattern file will be applied to the log and sensitive data may
not get obfuscated.

If you are uploading evidence that has been logged by anything other than the default debug level (i.e. if
you change the Log4j reporting level) the output will have to be checked manually for sensitive data.

The obfuscation job runs every 11 minutes and will obfuscate the file, add an evidence item and update
the Progress text with a link to the obfuscated data.

If obfuscation fails for any reason, the file will not be made available to download, the Call Progress will
be updated with a short error message and the User who added the evidence will be sent an e-mail.

If the source file takes longer than 10 minutes to process, obfuscation will be aborted. If the source file
contains anything other than plain text, the obfuscation will fail with “error 11” because it did not find any
tokens to apply the pattern checks to.

More details including a definition of the error codes can be found on the SSC Web Site in WAD019
“Obfuscation Tool for evidence to External Peak Companies”.

You could continue to route the call to the relevant team/user whilst waiting for the evidence to complete
obfuscation (see §8.20) when you will be asked to confirm that the incident may be passed to the
external company with the attached evidence.

8.26.2 Opening/Downloading (All) attached evidence

You can view evidence attached to a call, retrieve a copy of a particular file or retrieve all the files
attached to a call.

To view a file attached to a call, use the Open button within the Evidence page or you can click on the
link in the Progress text. But this only works for unzipped files since Windows Internet Explorer is called
directly to view the file; the file will not be unzipped before it is displayed

To retrieve one set of evidence, click the relevant Download button or the Download All button on the
top to retrieve all the non-archived evidence for the incident. When you select Save for the first time that
day, you will have to navigate to the correct directory. After this, the browser should remember the last
directory used for the rest of the day. FireFox has configuration parameter for setting the directory of
downloaded items.

Note that the Open and Download buttons may not be enabled depending on your level of privilege.

8.26.3 Deleting attached evidence

For security reasons, encrypted files are automatically deleted 28 days after the call is closed. If this has
happened, the files on the Evidence form will have all the buttons (Open, Download, Delete and
Update) replaced by the text “ARCHIVED” (as shown in Fig.8.26).

Evidence for other types of calls is not automatically archived but you can manually remove evidence by
clicking the Delete button next to the relevant file within the Evidence page.

8.26.4 Updating attached evidence

To update an evidence file which has already been uploaded to Peak, clicking the relevant Update
button. This will populate the ‘Details of file to be added/amended’ area in the bottom section of the
Evidence form with the details of the evidence item. Then you can make any necessary changes: from
changing the evidence description to replacing the file then press Update Evidence to save your
changes.

8.27 Close/Reopen Peak-originated calls

The Close/ReOpen button will only be enabled if the call originated from Peak and your Peak role
allows it; otherwise it will appear greyed out (§4.2.4).

Within the Call Details page, this button toggles between Close and ReOpen depending on whether the
Peak call is open or closed.

For details on closing OTI-originated calls, see §9.4. Closed OTI-calls cannot be reopened using Peak.

8.27.1 Closing Peak calls

You will only be able to Close Peak-originated calls and only if:
* you are a member of the Assigned team
*® you are a member of the Call Logger’s team
e you have Administrator privileges

«you have set a Final Response Category (via Add Response) and a Root Cause — but only if
the call has been through the rest of the Peak lifecycle (§4.2.3)

Once the call is closed, many fields and some buttons are disabled out but it is still possible to add a
response and the ReOpen button will remain activated.

8.27.2 Reopening Peak calls

You will only be able to Reopen Peak-originated calls and only if:
e you are the Call Logger
* you are someone from within that user's team

Clicking on Reopen will immediately reopen the call and assign it to the current user and team. Full
functionality will be returned; all the fields and buttons will be enabled again.

Note that instead of reopening a call, you could clone a close call; but only if your Peak role allows you
to do so (§4.2.4).

8.28 Last Progress

This a view-only field which displays the date, time and user who last made an update in the Response
Text or Progress box for this call.

8.29 Target

This field is automatically populated with a date which is generated from the Call Type, Priority and
date/time when the call was raised on the Peak system.

For example, the generated targets for incidents of the Call Type ‘L’ (Live incidents) are:
Priority A= 1 day

Priority B = 3 days

Priority C = 5 days

Priority D = 10 days

9.1 Progress Narrative

Information that has already been added to the call is displayed in this field and is not editable. The
content might have been transferred to Peak via the OTI or it could be text input into Progress box of the
New Call page when the incident was first created.

Text highlighted in blue in the ‘Progress Narrative’ window indicates a link to files such as evidence,
MSCs and SSCKELs that are attached to the call.

9.2 Progress Text/Response Text/Final Text
The title of this window will change dynamically depending on the ‘Response Category’ selected:

e Progress Text if ‘Response Category: Progress Only’
Updates of this type will not be sent to the external Helpdesk; they will just appear on the Peak.

e Response Text if ‘Response Category: Pending’
Final Text if ‘Response Category: Final’
These types of updates will be sent to the external Helpdesk (TfS or QC).

Each progress update has a unique ‘name’: #Progress1, #Progress2, #Progress3, etc. The name can be
determined by manually counting the number of preceding updates or in the tool-tip name; by hovering
within the relevant update. This enables you to create links which point directly to a specific update. So if
you wanted a link to the 12th update of incident PC020804 in another call, add a Call Reference with the
value ‘PC020804#Proqress12’. Alternatively, you could send someone the complete lin!

You can embed HTML into a progress update by including the text “[HTML]”; which will apply to all the
text in that update. For example,

[HTML]

Spell Checking

Clicking the icon ” enables you to spell check the text in this window. The Spel! Checker pop-up will
be displayed and allow you to step through potential spelling mistakes and select from a list of
alternatives. To replace a word with an alternative, click on it in the drop-down list or move on to the next
mistake by pressing Skip Word. When complete, to copy the new text back into the Progress window
press Done; which can be used at any time to skip the rest of the spell check.

This feature is also available when creating new calls (§12.3).
Format XML

Highlight the relevant text in the Progress window then click the icon ” to check the format of the

XML and make it more readable.

9.3 Progress Templates

Templates may be used to provide forms for the user to complete or guidelines for information required
for a type of incident. The ‘Progress Templates’ drop-down list, on the Add Progress page, gives a list of
possible pre-defined text templates that may be applied to the response box. When a template is
selected the corresponding text is appended to the Progress area; which can then be edited before
selecting a Response Category and pressing Save.

To create, edit or delete a Template see §26.

9.4 Response Category

Some guidance on Response categories is available via the Main Menu: Procedures button (currently
only available to OTI Administrator roles).

Several Final response categories shown in the ‘Response Category’ drop-down list have an orange
background (e.g. ’62 — Final — No fault in product’) this indicates that they are black mark closure
categories for the filtering teams and they count against that team’s filtration targets. These categories
should only be used in those cases where the filtering team should have been able to resolve the call
themselves or they did not provide the appropriate evidence as requested in a KEL.

Depending on the call type, the process below may also be described briefly in the helpful text
underneath the ‘Progress Templates’ drop-down.

9.4.1 Responding to Non-OTI Originated Calls

If you type in a Progress update but do not select a Response Category, the default is ‘Progress Only’.
This response type will just save the update to the Peak call; so, for QC incidents, the update will not be
sent to QC

Pending responses will also only appear on Peak call except for QC incidents when the update is also
copied back to QC.

Selecting a Final response will route the call back to the Call Logger who should check if they are happy
with the response and either close the call or return it for more information (e.g. ’52 - Pending -
Response Rejected’).

But for QC incidents, a Final response will route the call to the QC Interface team and a resolved
message will be sent to the QC interface. If the QC user is happy with the response they will send a
‘Closure Agreed’ which will close the Peak or a ‘Fix Rejected’ which will route the Peak back to the last
team. For more details, see §4.3.3.

9.4.2 Responding to OTI Originated Calls

Whilst the OTI call is in the Pending state, all updates or responses will be sent back over the OTI to
update the originating Helpdesk; except for ‘Progress Only’ updates (which only update the Peak call). It
should take 2 minutes for Peak updates to appear on their TfS call and similarly for TfS updates to
appear on their Peak call. Note that any OTII updates over 4Kb sent to the TfS Helpdesk will be
truncated.

Once the OTI call has a Final response, the incident will be routed back to the OT! Administrator team
(currently the SSC) to check the integrity of the closure response before closing the call on Peak; which
sends the Final response back across the OTI and passes ownership back to the originating Helpdesk.
The Helpdesk can then continue working on the call (checking back with the Branch, route the call onto
another Helpdesk, etc.) before closing the call on their system.

9.5 Effort (hours)

This field was used by Release Management process to identify the expected man effort the fix to a call
will require.

However with the introduction of Release Planning, this field is now no longer used.

9.6 Forecast Date and Development (ManDays)

On the Add Progress page, these are fields that may be populated as part of the Release Management
process.

When a Fix Impact is added by Development to a Peak, the expected date of the fix will be completed
and it is entered as a ‘Forecast Date’. The amount of time that the fix will take to complete is entered as
‘Development (ManDays)’.

Both these fields are available to be displayed on the Cail List and to be searched for using Query
Builder.

However with the introduction of Release Planning, these fields are now no longer used.

10 Searching for Calls

There are 3 ways to search for a particular call or a set of calls:

® Quick Search for simple searches if you have a reference (e.g. Peak, TfS, etc.)
e Freetext searching to search for text within a call
e =Query Builder for more complex searches — see (§11)

A very quick way to view a call is to enter the Cai/ Details page of another call and then modify the Peak
reference bit of the URL address so it looks like: “...?Call Reference=<other Peak reference>”.

10.1 Quick Search — find call [f]

Quick Search provides a facility for searching for a call based on the references that can be added to
Peaks (call reference numbers, Release Notes, KELs or TfS call references).

a Peak such as Release Notes, KELs or TfS call reference (§8.5). No wildcards are allowed in this field
and it is optional to include the “PC” Peak call reference prefix.

Then choose the relevant radio buttons depending on the kind of search you wish to do, then select

» Decide whether you want the search to find calls ‘Equal To’ or ‘Like’ the Reference entered.
» Define the range of the search - ‘Search All Calls’ or just ‘Search Open Calls Only’.

If only one result from the search is found then the call it is displayed directly in the Cail Details page but
if more than one result is found then the calls will be displayed in a Cail List grid.

10.2 FreeText searching

SQL server offers a facility for string comparisons similar to Internet search engines returning results and
a matching score or rank. The index used for this searching is held outside of SQL Server, which means
that these queries do not have the same impact upon Peak as searching the Progress Text via Query
Builder.

First, you will need to configure the type of search that is to be performed and then start the search by

pressing the icon “

e Wildcards - Partial word matching is possible using the “*” character. (e.g. “Config* “ would look
for all words starting with “Config”)

e Match ALL words - Search for progress updates that include all the search words (i.e. AND
function). This is the default.

« Match ANY words - Search for progress updates that include any of the search words (i.e OR
function). Note: This will take longer than the match ALL option and may timeout.

¢ Limiting matches - Restrict the returned matches to 50, 100 or Unlimited (9999).

e Ordering - The returned matches are listed in order of relevance then latest date. But if you
select the 'Order By Date’ it will default to Unlimited matches.

SQL server ignores some keywords which are removed before the query is executed. If your search
consists entirely of ignored words a warning will be displayed.

Each progress update is searched individually (rather than the entire incident) so some Peaks may
appear more than once in the results list.

Since the index is only (incrementally) rebuilt every Sunday morning at 06:30, any progress that was
added during the week will not be available for searching instantly.

If the keywords appear in the progress text more than once its ranking score will increase (out of 1000)
and the match will be listed higher in the results list.

Try to make your search as specific as possible, a single word search may match several hundred
updates. If they all have the same rank then only the first 50/100 matches will be displayed and may not
include the incident you were really interested in.

If you want to see all the calls in the result list in a Call List grid, press the Create Call List button at the
bottom of the page. This will call up the Multi-Query form and automatically generate a CSV list with just
the matched call references (§11.3).

Some of the information above can also be found on the FreeText page (““] FreeText searching
help”), click on the icon “#” to see the help on FreeText searching.

11 Queries

Queries are pre-defined search criteria which can be used to find calls quickly.

If you have not defined a default query (usually if you are a new user), Peak will create one for you which
will be used to load up the Call List on first logon — this usually displays open calls in all of the user's
teams. This query can be edited by the user via Query Builder and new queries can be added and saved
in the Query List for future use.

11.1 Query Builder - build query [b]

The Build Query page has several parts and functionalities. Searches can be simple or complex;
depending on how many conditions need to be satisfied.

Query builder acts as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where users can use drop-down lists to select
fields, operators and values to generate ‘Peak Query Code’ (which will automatically generate the
underlying ‘SQL Query Code’).

11.1.1 Search Title

If you are going to store this query for retrieval in the future, it is recommended that you type some
descriptive text in this field to help distinguish this query from others.

If no title is entered, then the first 50 characters of the ‘Peak Query Code’ will be used.

11.1.2 Field to be compared, Operator and Value

These three components are combined to produce a search condition. More complex queries can be
generated by defining more than one condition. Results are displayed only if the resulting query is true.

The ‘Field to be compared’ drop-down list contains columns in the Peak call that are most frequently
searched. If the column you wish to search on is not listed then e-mail the Peak Administrator to request
that it is added to the list.

Example of a simple search To retrieve a list of all (open and closed) calls progressed by me in the last
week:

> Select the following from the drop-down lists:
Field to be compared = Progressed By Me

Operator = Greater Than
Value = [LAST WEEK]

» Click either the Add (and) or Add (or) button to populate this condition into the ‘Peak Query Code’
as:
Progressed By Me — Greater Than — ‘[LAST WEEK]

and automatically generates the underlying ‘SQL Query Code’.

>» Atthis point, this simple query can be saved or just run using the Save Query and/or Run Query
buttons.

11.1.3 Add (AND) and Add (OR)

The Add (and) button is equivalent to the logical AND operator where all conditions have to be true for
the query to be fulfilled.

The Add (or) button is equivalent to the logical OR operator where only one of the conditions has to be
true for the query to be fulfilled.

The ‘Progressed by’ query option allows you to search for progress added by another user. Due to the
possible number of matches it is recommended that at least another condition is also added.

Example of a more complex search To retrieve a list of all (open and closed) calls progressed by the
user Tom Banks yesterday.

» Create the first simple search condition:

Progressed by — Equal To — ‘Tom Banks’
Click either the Add (and) or Add (or) buttons to populate the Peak and SQL Query Code fields.
» Create the second condition:

v

Date Last Updated — Equal To — ‘[YESTERDAY]’

» Since both conditions must be true for this query to produce the desired results then Add (and) must
be used to combine both conditions with the “AND” operator in the Peak and SQL Query Code
windows:

Progressed by — Equal To - ‘Tom Banks’ AND Date Last Updated - Equal To - ‘(YESTERDAY]’

Note that if Add (or) was used, instead of Add (and), then you would get a list of all the calls ever
progressed by the user Tom Banks as well as a list of all calls last updated yesterday (by anyone).

11.1.4 Parse Query and Clear Query

If you have the SQL role then after you have made some manual changes in the ‘Peak Query Code’
window, use Parse Query to check the validity of the ‘Peak Query Code’ before populating the ‘SQL
Query Code’ window with the equivalent update.

If you do not have the SQL role then Parse Query will be done automatically whenever a query is saved
or run.

Clear Query will reset all the fields in the Build Query form.

11.1.5 Add Events

Peak events, such as when an incident is routed to a particular team, can be added to a end of a
completed query

A pop-up window similar to Build Query is displayed. Simply select the fields, operators and values for a
simple or complex event search then click Add To Query and the event will be added to the end of the
‘SQL Query Code’ or Exit.

11.1.5.1 Set as Default Query

Selecting this option will make the current query your default query which will be loaded automatically
upon logon and will be shown as your default query in the Query List (§11.2).

11.1.5.2 Share Query

Selecting this option will make the current query a shared query which can then be listed and executed
from the Query List page by any user (§11.2).

order the results from the query will be displayed in the Calf List page.
» Select the columns you wish to sort on by highlighting them in the ‘Available Sort Fields’ window.

» Choose the ‘Order Direction’ (ascending or descending order).

» Click the >Add Ordering> button to migrate your selected columns into the ‘Ordered Fields’ window.
This box shows the fields that will be sorted and the field at the top will have the highest priority. You
can change the priority of the fields by highlighting the field in ‘Ordered Fields’ and clicking on the up
and down arrows “E” and “i” to increase or decrease its priority order.

If you want to remove one or more sort fields, highlight the field(s) in ‘Ordered Fields’ then click the
<Remove Ordering< button.

11.1.9 Displayed Fields

The set of fields: ‘Available Display Fields’, ‘All Fields’ and ‘Displayed Fields’ allow you to define the
columns to be displayed when the results of the query are returned in Call List.

To speed up display, deselect ‘All Fields’ and customise the ‘Displayed Fields’ list so just those columns
that you are interested in are displayed.

The functionality here is similar to that explained for Sort Fields (in §11.1.8).

The default set of columns listed in the ‘Displayed Fields’ window can be configured via:
e ‘Set as Default’ (§11.1.9.2) or
e ‘Default Query Fields’ in Preferences page (§13.11)

The ‘Call Reference’ column is a mandatory field which is always shown in ‘Displayed Fields’ and cannot
be removed.

Note that the order of the displayed columns is not configured in Build Query but in Call List (§7.3).

11.1.9.1 All Fields

This is just a quick way to display all the columns and overrides the columns listed in the ‘Display Fields’
window. By default, this box is unchecked which activates the >Add Field> and <Remove Field<
buttons.

11.1.9.2 Set as Default
This allows you to configure the default columns for all new future queries:
» Edit an existing query so it has the fields you wish to be default in its ‘Displayed Fields’ window.

» Tick the box named ‘Set as Default’ then Save Query. Note that the query must be saved for the
default fields to take effect.

» This will add the new default ‘Custom’ option to ‘Default Query Fields’ in Preferences. Although the
default option, you will still be able to change it to one of the other predefined options (§13.11).

11.1.10 Retrieve Query
Click to display a list of all your saved queries in the Query List page (§11.2).

11.1.11 Save Query

Click to store the current query in the Build Query page for future use. The query will then appear in the
Query List page (§11.2).

11.1.12 Run Query
Click to cause the selected criteria to be run against the Peak database — without saving.

If the query is successful, the system will automatically open the Cail List page displaying all the calls
that matched your criteria.

Fig.11.2: Query List showing Shared searches and Query Texts

If you are a new user, initially this list will just contain the default query set up by the Peak Administrator.
You can change the default by creating a new query and ticking its ‘Set as Default Query’ box
(§11.1.5.1). You will not be allowed to delete your last (default) query; otherwise Peak will not have a
query to load at logon.

Shared searches are just queries that can be shared with everyone else on Peak (§11.1.5.2). The ‘Show
Shared Searches’ field is a toggle which will hide/display the list of queries that have been shared and
allows you to Run, but not update, them.

The ‘Show Query Text’ field is a toggle which will hide/display the Peak Query Text and underlying SQL
Query Text for your specific and shared queries.

12 Creating new Calls — new calls [n]

When a new incident is reported, there must be a formal way of tracking and fixing the problem, an
incident or call must be raised and this can be done from an external helpdesk (TfS/QC) or from within
Peak depending on who the incident is being reported by e.g. Post Master via HSD, Events via SMC or
Testing via Testers.

This section explains how to create new Peak incidents. These calls are known as non-OTI originated or
OTI Consumer incidents which can be sent across the OTI to generate Helpdesk calls.

If you cannot create a new Peak call it could be because you are a member of the ‘Read Only’ role.
Contact the Peak Administrator if you wish to change this.

Fig.12: Create new Peak call page

Peak will automatically populate the ‘Call Logger’ and ‘Team’ fields with the information based on your
user account details but you can change the ‘Team’.

The mandatory fields are initially shown in orange and are: ‘Reported In Release’, ‘Call Type’, ‘Priority’,
‘Summary’ and ‘Subject Product’. As each mandatory field is populated, its colour will change from
orange to grey (normal). When the last mandatory field has been completed, the Route button will be
activated and when selected, a new Peak call reference will be generated then the call will be assigned
to the specified team or individual

The current process does not allow Development to raise new calls or clone calls. They have to contact
someone in the OTI Administrator team (currently the SSC) to do this task on their behalf.

Generally the fields on this page are as described in sections: §8: Displaying Call Details and §9:
Responding to a Call. If there is a difference in functionality or more explanation is required then they
are listed below.

12.1 Reported In Release

Each team has their own list of possible releases when raising a new call. The list changes if you choose

a different call logging team. If you are a member of multiple teams you may do this at the time of

raising a new call by changing the ‘Team’ in the top selection box.

If the release you require is not available in any of your teams, contact the Peak Administrator to make

the release available to the appropriate team.

For more information, see §8.4.

12.2 Top Ref

If you wish to define a top reference when creating a new call, the procedure is very similar to that

explained in §8.5, when adding references to existing Cail Details.

To add a reference to a new incident:

> Select the reference type from the ‘Top Ref’ drop-down list (e.g. ‘MSC’).

> This will display two boxes to the right of ‘Top Ref’ which are equivalent to the ‘Reference Value’ and
‘Expected Format’ fields in the References page (§8.5).

12.3 Response Text/Progress Text

The title of this window (Response Text or Progress Text).will change dynamically depending on the ‘Call
Type’ selected.

Any information deemed relevant can be added as text to the call. Within this window, you can embed

HTML into a progress text and run spell checker “

For more details about this field see §9.2.

12.4 Response Category

The contents of the ‘Response Category’ drop-down list will vary depending on the ‘Call Type’ that was
selected.

Use this drop-down list to define the response category of the text that you entered in the ‘Response
Text/Progress Text’ field (Progress Only or Pending).

See §9.4 for more information.

12.5 Target Date and Time

‘Target Date’ is the timescale within which a fault Peak call should be resolved. It is dependent on the
Call Type and Priority so once both of these fields have been selected, the ‘Target Date’ and ‘Target
Time’ fields will both be automatically be generated from the current date and time.

‘Target Time’ is displayed in local time.

See §8.29 for more information.

12.6 Auto Route/Route

All new calls must be initially routed to a Peak team. If required, that Peak team can then route the call
onwards to an external helpdesk like TfS.

Calls can be routed to teams/users within Peak or to external systems like TfS; but only if your Peak role
allows you to do so (§4.2.4).

Once the mandatory fields have been completed, the Route button will become enabled. By default,
new Calls will be routed to the ‘Call Logger’ but you can specify another team or user (via the ‘Manual
Routing’ drop-down lists and Find User) then click Route. This will commit the details of the call to the
Peak database, allocate a unique Peak reference and route the call to the relevant stack.

If the Route button does not become activated when all the other fields in the New Call has been
completed, this could be because you are running an older version of IE which does not correctly handle
the javascript commands that enables this button. You can either upgrade to (at least) IE6 Service Pack
1 or set the ‘Priority’ of the call last, which will cause a page refresh.

Note that the Auto Route button has been permanently disabled and will be removed in the future.

13.3 Size Call List for Fullscreen

This option only applies to the HTML and Java grids.

By default, the HTML Call List grid comes with a set of scroll bars which can be removed by selecting
the ‘Size Call List for Fullscreen’ option. This also means that if you print the page in landscape you will
get a nicer printout of the call list; without the scroll bars (§14.1).

In IE, to toggle between full-screen mode (which removes the IE menus and tabs and fills the whole
screen with just the Peak window) and the regular view, select View/Full Screen from the IE Menu bar or
press F11. Selecting this option with a Java Call List grid will resize the display for IE full-screen mode.

13.4 Automatically Fullscreen Call Details

To ensure that whenever you display the Cai! Details page it will always open in a wider and bigger view
select the ‘Automatically Fullscreen Call Details’ option.

13.5 Automatically Refresh Call List

This option only applies to the HTML, DHTML and Java grid (not AJAX).

Set the frequency that Peak should refresh or update the incidents in the Call List (default is 10 minute
intervals). If you do not select this option, you can use the Refresh button in Cail List to force a refresh
whenever you wish.

13.6 Display Horizontal lines in the Call List

Horizontal lines are drawn between each call in the HTML and Java Call List grids.

13.7 Display Queries in HTML Grid

If you select this option, you can then choose which one of three HTML grids (HTML, DHTML or AJAX)
the results from queries (via the Call List page) is to be displayed (default is HTML). If you deselect this
option, the HTML, DHTML and AJAX options will be disabled and Peak will use the Java grid.

The HTML version is robust in that it will work with most browsers but it has the limitation in that any
more than 100 rows will cause the query to slow down so this grid should only be used if the call list has
less than 200 rows.

The DHTML version has the benefit of being a dynamic grid with improved functionality (i.e. client-side
sorting, dynamic column sizing and column ordering) but it may be slower.

The AJAX version is a simple, lightweight grid but with very fast XML data refresh (once every minute).
This fast refresh rate is achieved by just getting back the changed text; not the whole page. But the
disadvantages of this grid is that it cannot be customised, sorted or columns re-sized and there is no bulk
update.

With the Java grid you can resize the columns, drag and drop columns and narrow columns and you can
load as many as 15,000 rows without losing speed. But, unlike with HTML/DHTML when no preparatory
work is needed before Peak can be used, Java must be installed and the ODBC configured before use.
Also be aware that this option is due to be phased out soon.

For a pictorial representation of the grids, see §7.

If selected, the same background picture that was set up in the ‘Current Background’ field (§13.2) will be
displayed on the Logon page otherwise it will display the default Peak mountain background.

13.21 Stretch background images (IE only)

If the background picture is smaller than the screen resolution, the picture will be tiled in the background.
If selected, the picture will be stretched to completely fill the background and only works on IE browsers.

13.22 Fix (Java) Call List size

This allows you to customize your Java Call List to a specific size rather than the default full screen and

14 Printing calls

Several options exist within Peak for printing incidents depending on what type of print output you want.

14.1 Print a call list

If you want a printout which is effectively a screen capture then, at the appropriate screen, select from
the IE menu: File/Print which will display the standard Microsoft Printer options window. This method can
be used to print a HTML/DHTML/AJAX call list. Note that in HTML, if you set the ‘Size Call list for
Fullscreen’ option in Preferences then the scroll bars will not appear in the printout (§13.3).

To print a Java call list, just press the Print button at the bottom of the Call List page.
Note that the Java grid is sized to fit all the fields on the page so if the printout is tiny then remove some
of the displayed fields in the query (see §11.1.9).

Another method that can be used to print the call list is to use Copy from the Call List to copy the grid
into an Excel Spreadsheet and then print its contents. For more details see §7.5.

14.2 Print individual call details

To print the call details for a single call, first view the incident via Call Details or Expanded Call Details
then use the Print button provided by Peak.

14.3 Print multiple call details — multiprint [m]

Call details from several incidents can be printed in one go by using this option which can be invoked
using one of the following:

1. Main Menu: click the Multi print button
2. drop-down menus at the top of each page: select Options/Multi-Print
3. shortcut key: press “m” key on the Main Menu page (“[m]”)

An empty Multi-Print screen will be displayed when called via the above 3 methods. In the ‘Calls to be
printed’ field, type in a comma separated list of the call references to be printed (e.g. “PC0083330,
PC0089261, PC0093131”) then press the Print Calls button else Cancel Printing.

4. (HTML/DHTML/Java) Multi Print button in Cail List. This button will become activated as soon
as you select at least one call.

To select the calls, in HTML use the tick boxes on the left-hand side of each call and in DHTML/Java
CTRL+click individual calls. As soon as you press Multi Print Peak will start printing the first call.

Each call reference starts off in the ‘Calls to be printed’ window then it is removed as the Microsoft Print
window appears for you to select the printer and click Print. Then depending on whether the print was
successful, the call reference will appear in ‘Calls printed’ or in ‘Calls in Error’.

Note that the Microsoft Print window will be displayed before an attempt is made to print the incident (as
well as for each retry). This is because Multi-Print opens a new hidden page for each call and
automatically prints it before moving on to the next call. IE does not allow for web pages to print
themselves without prompting the user.

16 Collections [c]

Collections allow a user to group a set of related calls under a defined name. These calls can then be
retrieved by building a query using the collection name (e.g. Collection — Contains - <Collection_name>,
see §11.1 for details).

To define or create a new Collection:
» Decide who you want to be able to update this Collection.
e Private/Any Team restricted to the creator (default)

«  Private/<Team> restricted to any user in the selected <Team>
In this case, Peak will automatically add the text “(Team)” to the end of the Collection description
in the ‘Add Incident to Collection’ drop-down list.

e = Public unrestricted; anyone may update this Collection — tick ‘Public’.
In this case, Peak will automatically add the text “(Public)” to the end of the Collection
description in the ‘Add Incident to Collection’ drop-down list.

Note that anyone who adds a Peak to a Collection may also remove them. But the owner may
remove any Peaks from a Collection.

To update an existing Collection, use the ‘Select Collection’ drop-down list to choose the relevant
Collection name. Note that the drop-down list will only display collections that you have permissions to
change i.e. your own public and privately created collections.

Once a Collection has been created, the Create Collection button is disabled but the Save Changes,
Restore to saved, Delete Collection and Remove All Incidents buttons are available. The Collection
can now be populated with calls via the Collections button in Cail Details (§8.17).

After having updated any of the fields in this Collections page, for the change to take effect use the Save
Changes button otherwise Restore to saved to ignore any updates and restore the Collections page to
the last saved version.

If there is at least one call associated with a collection, you can press the icon “!’, next to the legend
“There are N Calls in this collection’, to display an embedded list of these calls. From here, you can click
on the Peak reference link to view the call details or Remove a particular call from the Collection. Note
that the Remove All Incidents button will remove all the calls associated with a Collection.

Delete Collection will remove the selected Collection and any associations that this Collection had with
any calls will also be severed.

Here follows some examples of the ways Collections can be used.

Example 1 Release Management review a number of Peak incidents each week. Usually they e-mail out
a list of these calls to all those involved in the review and they print and read the list before attending.

Release Management could create a new Collection named ‘RMF to be reviewed’, then they can add
those calls to be reviewed at the next meeting to the collection.

Release Management could then create a new Query that lists all the calls in this Collection
(Collection — Equal To — ‘RMF to be reviewed’)
and mark it as shared.

The review members could run this shared query to create a call list of those calls to be reviewed, they
could highlight all the calls and use multi print to print all the calls.

The Collection could be kept up-to-date with and new additions to the review, if they want other people to
be able to add calls to this collection they would make it public.

Example 2 Peter is in the Support Unit. Sometimes he may diagnose a call which he then passes on to
Development, however he would be interested in the progress of this call and would not like to lose sight
of it. He can create a private collection, add any calls of interest to it and create a query to display all
calls in the collection.

17 Alerts [a]

Alerts are activated when a specified action or trigger takes place. You can configure what types of alerts
are generated and what action will trigger those alerts from the User Alerts screen.

To create a new Alert:
> Type in aname and summary description for the Alert
>» Decide which single action will activate the alert from the ‘Activates when’ drop-down list:
* Call arrived on a team
« Call assigned to a team member
* Call closed
e Target Release changed
e Call arrived on system
° etc.
> Select the type of alert you want delivered using the ‘Delivered by’ drop-down list:

© Email

a HTTP link to the Peak call

« Mobile Phone SMS (Short Message Service)
delivered to your mobile phone. Once ‘Mobile Phone SMS’ has been selected, a field will appear
for you to type in a mobile phone number. If you have registered an Alert phone number with
Peak (e.g. when your Peak user was created, §4.2.1) then this number will be retrieved and
displayed but you can change it.

If you wish to register or change your registered Alert phone number on Peak, get in touch with
the Peak Administrator.

e PEAK user message
shown in the Main Menu page immediately after you have logged in (§29).

>» Adjust the following set of fields to further specify your alert or leave them unchanged; so everything
is matched:

e Assigned Team/User equals
e Priority equals

e Logger Team/User equals

« Call Type equals

e Actioned Team/User equals
e Release equals

e Collection equals

For example, to create an alert when a call arrives on any team then just set the trigger as ‘Call
arrived on team’. But to generate an alert when a call arrives on a specific team, you must also.
select the team name from the ‘Assigned Team equals’ list.

Fig.17: Updating an existing Alert

All new Peak users are automatically set up with an enabled alert which will send them an e-mail when
they are assigned an ‘A’ priority call but you can change this alert so that the e-mail triggers on calls of
any priority. To update an existing alert:

» Click on the alert that you wish to change at the top half of the User Alerts screen, which will
highlight the alert in orange and then update the bottom half of the form with its details.

Change ‘Priority equals’ to ‘Any’

Update the ‘Named’ and ‘Summary Description’ fields to reflect this change in functionality

vVvv

To create a new Alert and keep the existing ‘A’ priority alert, press Clone Alert.
To save these changes to the existing alert, press Save Changes or Restore to saved to cancel the
changes and Delete Alert will remove this Alert altogether.

You will not be alerted to changes that you yourself have initiated. Therefore if you assign a call to
yourself and you have an alert which triggers when you are assigned a call, you will not receive the alert.

18 Conferences

This feature allows any Peak user to create a forum or conference for discussing a topic. Each root
conference may be further broken down into 3 levels of sub-topics or sub-conferences.

A Conference may have a status of open/closed and public/private. Only invited users can read, update
or create sub-conferences for Private conferences; invited by the conference convenor/creator. Whereas
any user can read, update or create sub-conferences for Public conferences.

There are two ways to navigate between the Conference functions:

1. Using menu driven command under the main headings: Conference/Summary, View
Conference, Search and Maintain.

2. Using the Conference menu bar which appears in all of the Conference screens:

26 Templates

If you find that you or your team are typing in the same or similar text over and over again in call
responses, you should use templates. You will be able to call up the template from the Add Progress
page (via the ‘Progress Templates’ drop-down list), edit it before saving it as your response (§9.3).

Templates can be used by anyone but they may be owned by a particular team to restrict editing.
To manage templates, use the Templates button on the Main Menu.

To create a new template, set ‘Select Template=New Template’, type in a ‘Template Name’ and specify
the ‘Owning Team’ (from any of the teams you are a member of); this restricts further changes to the
template to members of that team only. Type in the template text and when finished press Add
Template.

To edit an existing template, select the template name from the ‘Select Template’ drop-down list. You
will be allowed to change ‘Template Name’, ‘Owning Team’ or template text then press Save Changes
or Restore. Otherwise use Delete Template to remove the template from the System.

28 Links to external systems

28.1 Known Error Log (KEL)

The Known Error Log (KEL) exists on the SSC website and is a collection of known defects, incidents
and problems that can be searched using a combination of keywords.

The KEL system can be accessed directly from the Search KEL or Raise KEL buttons on the Main
Menu but only if you have a UK or SSC domain login. If you are a non-UK or non-SSC domain user
then you will be presented with the NT domain login window.

KELs are primarily used by First and Second Line Support to determine if the problem being reported
has been seen before and therefore can be resolved without routing the call on to Peak. If a KEL exists
then it should contain useful information such as the extent of the problem, who the call should be routed
to, any work-around information, if a fix is due to be released, etc. If a KEL does not exist then the call
can be routed to the Peak System along with evidence for further investigation.

Hints on searching the KEL can be found by clicking on ‘KEL searching’ on the KEL Search web page.

Usually KELs are created when a software error has been identified; this can be by First or Second Line
Support, the SSC or even Testers (QC). If the KEL is raised with Peak call reference, then the KEL
reference will be automatically added to the Peak as a ‘Reference’ (§8.5). KELs may also be created for
non-software problems which could cause many Branches to phone the Helpdesk with the same issue.

If you are unable to create KELs but you can log onto the SSC Website, contact the SSC to enable this
facility.

Any calls returned from Development should have an associated KEL which may need to be updated by
the SSC before the closure response is sent back to the Originator. This ensures that KELs contain
current information so that the Helpdesk are always referring to the latest and relevant information.

Helpful guidelines on how to create KELs can be found by clicking on ‘KEL create notes’ and ‘KEL
formatting notes’ on the Create HNGX KEL web page.

28.2 Documents

The SSC website holds lots of support documentation generated by Development (e.g. High and Low
Level Designs, Support Guides, etc.) and Post Office Limited (e.g. Branch Focus issues, Operations
Manuals, etc.).

The Document Searches page can be accessed directly from the Documents button on the Main Menu
but only if you have a UK or SSC domain account.

28.3 TRIOLE for Services (TfS)

TFS incidents may be viewed by connecting to the TfS website which requires a TfS account.

Any Peak incidents which were transferred over the OT! from TfS will have an automatically generated
‘Top Ref’ of 'TRIOLE for Service’ containing the TfS reference. Clicking on this reference will take you
directly to the incident in TfS; provided you have set up your TfS logon credentials (§13.24).

29 User Information

Peak Support can broadcast messages to all Peak users, a particular company, specific team or user.
Usually these messages are used to advise users of new developments in Peak and any planned
outages.

New users automatically receive all messages broadcast since Peak first went live.

If a new message is delivered whilst you are logged in, you will not see the message until the page is
refreshed. When you have read a message, you may be removed from your list by pressing Delete.

User information is sorted in date order with newest messages at the top but this order can be changed
by clicking on the arrow “i”or “E¥” next to the User Information button.

You can also find out about the status of your messages within the Call Details page. At the top of this
page, next to the title “Peak Incident Management System” it may say e.g. “3 unreadiaal” which means
that you have 3 messages which have not been deleted. Clicking on the icon @ will take you back to
the Main Menu to view user information.

Note that you cannot avoid seeing new messages in the Main Menu screen. Even if you tick the
Preferences option ‘Open Default Call List when Logon’ (§13.16), you will not be able to by-pass the
Main Menu if you have any undeleted or new messages. With this in mind, you could create an alert to
send you a Peak User Message when it is triggered (§17).

A APPENDIX: Java

To use Peak you do not need to install Java; as all the facilities are available on HTML pages. But some
users prefer to use the enhanced features offered by Java; even though this option is due to be phased
out.

A.1_ Installing the Peak Alerter

The Peak Alerter is a client-side program that will monitor a selection of your queries for any changes. It
effectively connects to your profile, reads all your queries, converts them to counts and runs them every
minute.

If the count changes, a balloon help will display the Query Name and the change count. This provides a
much quicker alerting system than e-mail but may be missed if the user is away from their desk.

The latest version also allows for messages to be sent to other users of the Peak Alerter software
directly.

To install Peak Alerter, make sure that you have Java installed, open the share \\peak2\share and copy
the folder PeakAlerter to your local disk. Double-click peakalerter.jar to run the program.

The first time it runs it will request your Peak username (which will be remembered from that point on).
You may copy a shortcut to your StartUp folder for the alerter to run automatically when you log on.

To identify which queries you wish to monitor, add a “#” (hash) symbol to the start of the query name.

B APPENDIX: Peak Encryption

With the introduction of encryption to sensitive Peak pages (Logon and change Password screens), your
browser may try to warn you whenever you access an encrypted page from an unencrypted one that the
Peak Certificate has not been signed by one of the trusted Certification Authorities.

You will get different alerts depending on the browser being used. To make the Peak Certificate trusted
so that the alert will no longer appear follow the steps described on Peak in Help/FAQ.
