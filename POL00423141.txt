POLARC12/8 INTRODUCTION

(a) A quorum being present, the Chairman of the Committee opened the meeting
and welcomed all those present.

(b) The Chairman noted that the Committee would not be able at this meeting to
discuss Risk Management in detail, as the executive team were still working
through the processes and the necessary recruitments had not yet been
completed. The approach to risk management would be a matter for
particular focus at the next meeting in February.

POLARC12/9 GOVERNANCE
(a) The Chairman asked MZ to talk through the new format proposed for the

Terms of Reference of the Committee, including an outline schedule of
matters to be discussed and a form of standing agenda.

(b) Following discussion, it was agreed that the revised Terms of Reference for
the Committee, dated November 2012, are approved and adopted subject to
an amendment in 2.1 to clarify that the HR & Corporate Services Director and
the General Counsel were the same role.

(c) These Terms of Reference would be included in the pack of corporate
ACTION: Company governance documents to be approved by the Board in January 2013.
Secretary
(d) The Committee requested that the banking and treasury delegated authority
limits discussed at the Board meeting on 23 October 2012 should return to
the ARC in February for discussion and that outstanding balances and any
ACTION: CD breaches by counterparties be brought to the attention of the ARC.

(e) The Committee asked for sight of the internal audit reports completed since
April 2012, and a status report on the audit actions to be presented at the
ACTION: MZ February meeting.

(f) IThe Committee requested discussion at the February meeting on:

(i) the policies in place to mitigate against key business risks (a paper to be
produced by the Head of Risk Governance); and

(ii) the process for establishing and ensuring compliance by the Business
with those policies and with regulatory requirements. It was recognised
that this exercise would take some time, with priority areas starting to
become clear over the course of 2013.

ACTION:MZ/SC
(g) The CFO and HR & Corporate Services Director would then lead a session at
the Board to give comfort that the Business understands its regulatory risks
and has the policies in place to monitor and mitigate.
ACTION: CD/SC.

POLARC12/10 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND HALF YEAR TRADING
STATEMENT

(a) CD presented the latest draft of the half-year trading statement. It was noted
that the DVLA decision had now been announced and could therefore be
included in the statement.

(b) It was noted that the trading statement had not been reviewed formally by
Ernst & Young but it was confirmed that the basis of preparation was
consistent and that there had been no major changes in accounting policies
or practice.

(c) IThe proposed date for release of the statement to the press and general
public was 22 November 2012. Discussions would be held separately with
the Shareholder.

(d) The Committee discussed the tone of the statement and the comments
received to date from members of the Board and it was agreed that final
comments would be input by 14 November, after which the statement

ACTION: CD would be re-circulated to the Board for final approval.

ACTION: Company (e) A copy of the final statement and press release would be circulated to the
Secretary Board.

(f) I The paper presented by SH, setting out an approach for preparation of the full
year accounts for 2012/13, was considered.

(g) After discussion it was agreed that:

(i) I Post Office should not take advantage of the exemptions from being a
wholly owned subsidiary of a UK parent producing group financial
statements;

(ii) Post Office should continue to report under UK GAAP but the
consolidated financial statements will be under IFRS;

(iii) the Post Office Annual Report and Financial Statements should be
prepared as one formal document for lodging at Companies House;

(iv) Post Office should include the additional Business Review disclosures
applicable to quoted companies where appropriate;

(v) Post Office should aim to meet the elements of the UK Corporate
Governance Code and DTR disclosure requirements on corporate
governance that are appropriate; and

(vi) Post Office should comply with legal requirements concerning the
disclosure of directors’ remuneration but would not seek to go beyond
the statutory level of disclosure for the financial year 2012/3.

A full analysis of Post Office’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance
ACTION: Company Code was under way and would be provided for discussion by the Committee
Secretary at its next meeting.

There appeared to be nothing which would prevent the Post Office from
confirming that it upheld the principles of the Code, even if some of the
detailed recommendations would not be applicable to a Government-owned
organisation.

POLARC12/11 RISKS — HIGH RISK CONTRACTS.

The CEO, LS and HF joined the meeting to provide an update on the
information security issue which had recently been faced by the Post Office.

An approach to establishing the risk profile of customer data held within the
Post Office had been set out in the paper from LS and this was discussed.

The Committee thanked the CEO and the Business for the rigour with which
they had handled the issue and asked for a short update report in mid-
December followed by a formal report on information security for the next
ARC meeting in February, including a noting paper on High Risk Contracts.

The Committee asked to be kept informed in the meantime of any actions
necessary to mitigate against any actual or perceived liability on the part of
ACTION:LS the Post Office.

POLARC12/12 INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDIT
(a) SC, AG and JM joined the meeting.

(b) MZ was introduced as the new Head of Internal Audit. He explained the
future audit team he was recruiting for the Business and that going forward
the audit plan would be based on the key risks which would be signed off by
the ARC. He confirmed the activity in the Audit plan for 2012/13 and that
Royal Mail’s Internal Audit Team would assist Post Office up to 31 March
2012.

(c) The Committee agreed that there may be a need to monitor the increased
strategic risks driven by separation and transformation, but that there also
needed to be a focus on compliance within the Network.

(d) IThe Committee asked for a summary of the areas covered by RMG Internal
ACTION:MZ Audit reports to be presented to the ARC in February.

Stephen Collins left the meeting

(e) AG, the Ernst & Young Audit Partner responsible for the Post Office external
audit, reported that the previous year’s audit had been finalised. He expected
that 2012/13 would be a challenging year for the Business in several areas
because of separation and major change, and that the audit would need to
focus on separation, pensions, and taxation with an overlay of IT. He set out
the proposed approach to external audit of the full year accounts and the
outline timetable. The detailed focus of the audit would be:

(i) Revenue recognition and the accounting treatment across diverse
revenue streams;

(ii) Counterparty risk;
(iii) Pension valuation and accounting;
(iv) Separation accounting risks; including pensions and treasury;
(v) Valuation of accounting provisions;
(vi) Risk of fraud/burglary in the Network and Cash operations;
(f) The ARC was comfortable with the approach, alongside the separate
ISAE 3402 IT audit which had been jointly commissioned by the Post Office
and Fujitsu.
(g) The Chairman asked at what level of materiality the E&Y team would report.
AG explained that this would be similar to previous years. Although E&Y did

put a figure on P&L materiality, they would propose to report any identified
audit adjustments above £600k to the Committee and, as a general rule,

insist on changes to the accounts for any single item or accumulation of items
with an effect of over £5-6 million. This was accepted.

(h) The Chairman informed the meeting that he would pick up the Ernst & Young
fees with the CFO outside the meeting
ACTION:AM/CD
(i) I The external audit plan was agreed. The external auditors left the meeting.
POLARC12/13 MATTERS REFERRED TO ARC BY THE BOARD

Governance of the “Eagle” Contract

(a) NK joined the meeting.

He presented the paper and explained the governance processes now in

place with the Bank of Ireland (Bol) following agreement of the new contract.

The Committee was informed of the arrangements and the governance

committees put in place to monitor performance. The Committee asked that

the minutes of future Regulatory Risk Committees (RRC) be provided for the
ACTION: NK ARC.

(b) NK noted the termination rights currently contained in the contract. Bol was
obliged to provide certification within 15 days of each quarter end to assure
Post Office that Bol was meeting its requirements in respect of:

(i) Tier One Ratio and Capital buffers
(ii) Liquidity
(iii) NSFR requirement

and that it had not breached any of the terms of the contract creating a
Termination Obligation.

(c) The Chairman asked if this gave the Business sufficient warning of any
problems. NK assured the Committee that the Bank was obliged to give Post
Office early warning of any capital or liquidity problems and Post Office had a
buffer above the regulatory and statutory requirements set by HM Treasury
(HMT), the Bank of England (BoE) and the FSA.

(d) Post Office had also established a system for tripartite meetings with HMT
and BoE, to which the FSA was also invited. The purpose of this meeting
was to give Post Office a medium to long term view of the banking
environment and how any developments might affect the Post Office.

(e) NK explained that the FSA would soon be splitting to form two organisations:
the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA). This should lead to a strengthening of regulatory
relationships and give the Business more comfort.

(f) The Committee asked NK to provide an interim update on the regulatory
ACTION: NK position in September 2013, 6 months after the changes had taken effect.

Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential

(g) IThe Chairman noted that it would be useful at the same meeting to look at
ACTION:NK scenarios in which Post Office would need to respond to a termination event.

(h) NK reported that Post Office deposits had grown substantially above the
planned £16.6 billion target agreed with the FSA. The parties were working
together to agree a commercially sustainable position on pricing for Bol whilst
ensuring protection for Post Office customer assets and the Post Office
brand.

NK explained the securitisation of assets by Bol and noted that the new
contract required consent from the Post Office to securitise any Post Office
customers’ assets. The terms were designed to ensure that Post Office
customers’ assets were managed effectively but also ring-fenced in the event
that a transfer to an alternative provider became necessary.

NK then left the meeting.

Uncommitted Credit Facilities

ACTION: (i) I The CFO asked for the Committee’s views on the proposals relating to
CD/Company uncommitted loan facilities which had been put forward to the Board. He
Secretary noted that banking counterparties would require a resolution of the full Board.

(j) I The Committee discussed the proposals to enter into two loan facilities. CD
confirmed that these proposals had been discussed with the Shareholder and
no concerns had been expressed.

(k) I The Committee endorsed the following recommendations to the Board:

(i) approval for Post Office to enter into external borrowing facilities up to a
maximum value of £100m, such that external borrowing of up to £50m
may be drawn down at any one time;

(ii) approval for the CFO and Head of Corporate Finance to conduct
negotiations with counterparties and sign and deliver the loan and
related documentation

(iii) approval for the form of Board resolution included in the paper, subject
to review by Susan Crichton (Head of HR and Corporate Services).

POLARC12/14 ANY OTHER BUSINESS

ACTION: (a) It was agreed that the schedule of meeting dates for 2013 should be revised
Company to allow for meetings in February, May, September and November. The
Secretary Company Secretary was asked to recirculate the dates.

POLARC12/15 CLOSE

There being no further business, the meeting was declared closed.

T&D Reviews — It was agreed that a full root & branch review of the in-branch T&D framework would take place following the full deployment of the
video mystery shopping programme.

Savings Mystery shopping results for T&D Reviews in Q3 showed some slight improvement on Q2 results; with a caveat that Q3 volumes were lower
than those undertaken in Q2. It was agreed that the success of the credit card re-accreditation programme would be assessed at the end of Q4
Financial Promotions — Deterioration in quality of submissions from POL is impacting on Bank ability to sign off promptly. An action was agreed to
review stakeholder responsibilities in light of the recent structural change and the need for clarity of accountability in the new structure for the different
elements of the FP production and approval cycle. It was agreed that it would be helpful to bring in the Product Managers as part of the review.
-Video Mystery Shopping - Feedback received to-date suggests that the pilot has been a success. However, a date has not yet been agreed for a full
rollout. The Committee agreed that the next phase should, include counter staff as Banks risk is not limited just to FS’s.

The Mortgage Pilot 3 month interim review showed positive indicators following post validation calls which were carried out on small sample of 14
customers. The Pilot will continue lead by 10 Mortgage Specialists. Further discussions took place re the expected outcome of the pilot and next steps.

Key discussion points:

Governance:

th

Key decisions of 16" November were approved and all open actions were updated.

BOI (UK) Regulatory & Operational Risk Monitoring:

T&D Reviews — The overall rating of Crown T&D reviews for the month was Amber. Generic Reviews reported no change at amber and significant
improvement was noted on the Thematic Mystery Shopping of credit cards with an overall rating graded green (24 green & 4 red). All mystery shops
were noted to be carried out post the POL credit card training in early November.

Exceptions report was presented with additional detail on each exception following queries raised by POL at November meeting. The Committee was
advised that further monitoring would take place in Jan/Feb 2013

Generic Compliance Reviews — The Committee was again made aware of the review findings in terms of the number of staff who are unaware of the
procedure to follow in the event of a customer wishing to make a complaint - This has now increased to an exception rate of 83% over the last 3 months.
-Video Mystery Shopping pilot (phase II) — All video mystery shops associated with phase II of the pilot (a mix of credit card & savings products)
have been completed across a total of 17 locations. The assessment process was confirmed as being underway and DC advised findings to date show an
increase in Red results for phase II. . DM advised that POL will be compiling a report in relation to the performance of the pilot, which will be made
available to the committee for review once complete. In terms of full roll out of Video Mystery Shopping, POL advised that it would be preferable to
first identify whether it could be procured from one of their existing mystery shopping providers such as ABA(POL are subject to public procurement
rules which make it simpler to procure services from existing suppliers). RH confirmed that he understood the challenge faced by POL in this respect,
but stressed that any party wishing to be considered for the tender process must be capable of demonstrating their ability to deliver the service
effectively.

POJV Compliance update
Branch Mystery Shopping— the monthly report demonstrated continuing improvement in relation to the number of green ratings now being achieved.

AH highlighted the CPP mis-selling- FSA Fine and advised that POJV Compliance would be carrying out an analysis of the sales practices that led to the
FSA taking action against CPP to ensure that BOI (UK) has no similar regulatory compliance exposure. An update will be provided at the next meeting.
Gender neutral pricing — It was confirmed gender neutral pricing has been introduced for all insurance products.

Deposit Protection — Raising Consumer Awareness- while the FSA’s new rules in this regard are not applicable to POL, a range of ‘voluntary’ measures
were to have been considered by the POL Executive Committee. J. Hill took an action to circulate an update to the Committee ahead of the next meeting in
January 2013

Regulatory Risk Assessment & Management Process

Regulatory Watch List — due to the unavailability of data, this report was noted to be incomplete. AH confirmed that, assuming the data is available, an
updated report will be produced for the January 2013 meeting.

BOI (UK) Risk Planning Register — This report is not available until working day 20, it was agreed the Secretary would circulate once available. (Secretary
issued this report to the committee & attendees 21" December 2012)

Customer Complaints Report — The Complaints report (in a temporary format) was presented to the Committee and the Chairman confirmed an action to
liaise with Bob Tennant in order to agree how future Complaints reports would be presented. Separately, a POL review of Post Office Complaints was noted
to be currently underway and JH suggested POL would engage with the BOI (UK) complaints team once their review was complete. AH added that he will
restart the production of the quarterly analysis of in-branch complaints in the new year.

TCF —

Outcome I - Complaints from CMCs with regards to PPI mis-selling — It was noted that 91% complaints are not upheld and a very significant percentage
(circa 70%) did not have PPI policy for the product against which the complaint was raised. DC advised that work is in progress within BOI UK to implement
a simplified process for dealing with DSAR requests from CMC’s in relation to PPI claims. Longer term this should see a reduction in the number of
speculative complaints that subsequently come in. Several of the larger CMC’s have signed up to the simplified process, and BOI UK Risk team would be
engaging with Rob Lear of Group Customer Complaints to maximise opportunity.

Voice of Customer/Social Media Update - As NF was unable to attend the meeting, it was agreed this item would be carried forward to QBR.

AOB - Terms of References - A number of small queries were raised in relation to the TOR:(i) it was advised NK would only attend meetings on a
quarterly basis;(ii) Under the “Duties” section of the document, it was requested that “POL” is removed from “Voice of the Customer and Social media
reports”; and (iii) there was an action for the Committee to agree how its duties align to those of other POL/BOI (UK) Committees in terms of responsibility
and reporting.

2013 Schedule of meeting dates — HS confirmed that the proposed set of 2013 meeting dates are with POL for review and approval. JH committed to
reverting on the dates w/c 15" December.

6.1 Malcolm Zack provided a verbal update from the Audit & Risk Committee
(ARC). He stated the Chair of the ARC had requested an update on the
policies in place within Post Office Ltd, the availability of these policies and
whether the Business was compliant with them.

Action 1526 Put together a proposal for the next R&CC for the
management of policies within Post Office Ltd to ensure all policies are
in place, available and that the Business is compliant against them.

Action 1527 Put together a response to the next available ARC,
following the March R&CC meeting, identifying Post Office Ltd
approach to the management of policies to ensure all are in place,
available and that the Business is compliant against them.

relating to the linking of the ARC and the R&CC had been circulated in

advance of the meeting. There was no further discussion and the meeting

8. Enterprise Risk
Management
Update

8.1 Nigel Tuppen explained that a new Risk Policy had been developed in
liaison with Internal Audit and this had been circulated for approval. This was
discussed and endorsed by the meeting and it was agreed that the policy be
submitted to the ARC for final sign off.

8.2 NT gave an update over ERM and stated that Strategy and Network &
Sales directorates had not yet fully identified their key risks and that the
overall process for identifying risks was still very “bottom up”. He stated this
should be resolved by planned session with the ExCo to discuss and review
key risks.

8.3 NT explained that there was an inconsistent approach to the use of the
project server programme management tool. He highlighted that some
programmes didn’t have any risks identified on this tool. He also stated that
the development of the interface between project server and the Stratex risk
tool was in progress at the technical build stage.

8.4 The Key Risks paper was reviewed and discussed. In particular there
was a discussion around identified key risks relating to information security
and the need for a progress update on this in next meeting.

Malcolm Zack highlighted need to show the movement of the key risks for the
next update meeting. Also to consider also showing risks that are have a high
impact but low likelihood

8.5 The Programme risks were discussed and MZ queried what had
happened to justify the downward movement identified on the heat map. It
was therefore agreed at the meeting that the SPMO should be invited to
attend the R&CC to provide an update on the Network Transformation
programme to explain key risks and their movement.

Underpinning
legislation

The Post Office.V1

This policy applies to all colleagues of the Post Office.
This policy is effective from 01 April 2012.

This policy does not form part of contracts of employment. We reserve the right
to amend this policy from time to time.

The Speak Up Policy sets out the process by which workers, i.e. colleagues and
others who are contracted to personally perform work on behalf of the Post
Office, can raise concerns in confidence and if required, anonymously about
serious malpractice in the organisation in the knowledge that concerns will be
acknowledged and action taken where appropriate.

Any worker who raises a legitimate concern in good faith under this process will
not in any way be liable to disciplinary action or loss of benefits, rights or
prospects as a result of their action.

Disciplinary action may be taken against any worker who is shown to have used
these procedures to make malicious or misleading allegations.

Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity. Workers who raise concerns are
sometimes understandably concerned about their position, and may wish to
remain anonymous.

However, it is often difficult to conduct an effective investigation without being
able to discuss it fully with the person who raised the concern. The helpline staff
will ask callers if they are willing to provide a contact name and number, but
callers do not need to provide contact details.

Although the business will attempt to investigate anonymously raised concerns
wherever possible, practical difficulties may prevent investigations from being
undertaken in certain cases.

Workers are protected by the Public Interest Disclosure Act (PIDA), which
provides workers with the right not to suffer any detriment or dismissal by the
employer if they raise a concern which qualifies as a protected disclosure.

PIDA identifies protected disclosures as those which are made in good faith and
are reasonably thought to show one or more of the following:

e That a criminal offence has been committed, is being committed or is likely to
be committed

e That a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply with any legal
obligation to which he /she is subject

e That a miscarriage of justice has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur

e That the health or safety of any individual has been, is being or is likely to be
at risk

The Post Office.V1

¢ That the environment has been, is being or is likely to be damaged; or

e That information about any of the above matters is being or is likely to be
deliberately concealed

A disclosure will not qualify as protected if the person making the disclosure
commits an offence by making it.

Workers should raise a concern if they are aware of, or suspect, wrongdoing
which affects others (eg. customers, members of the public, colleagues or the
Post Office).

Some examples of situations where a worker may raise a concern are:
e Fraud

e Giving or taking of bribes

e Financial malpractice

e Misreporting

Practices that might put individuals or the environment at risk

.In the first instance workers should raise concerns with their line manager, or a
senior HR manager in the Post Office. They will either act on the information
given to them, or pass it to the relevant person who can deal with it.

It is recognised that sometimes raising a concern directly with the business will
not be possible, for example, if the worker considers that the line management
may be involved in the issue or if they have a concern about confidentiality.

In such instances workers should contact the “Speak Up” confidential reporting
line, which is run by InTouch MCS Ltd, an independent company. Access to the
reporting line can be made by phone or via an on-line web service. InTouch will
treat concerns in complete confidence and the worker does not have to provide
contact details.

The worker will be requested to provide information about their concern, for
example the history of the concern, relevant individuals and the reason why they
are particularly concerned about the situation.

There is no requirement to provide contact details. However, not providing details
may reduce the business’ ability to make a thorough investigation into the
concerns raised. All calls to the Speak Up line will be acknowledged within five
working days.

Details of the concern raised will be forwarded to the Post Office who will act on it
in the most appropriate way. Any resulting investigations will be made by people
with appropriate authority who have the technical and professional knowledge
needed for the particular case.

It is possible that the business may wish to directly contact the worker to request

additional information. This will be done only where the worker has given
express consent and are happy for a representative from the Post Office to

speak directly to them. In all cases the individual's concern will be treated
sensitively and in confidence.

Where concerns about serious malpractice are raised through other routes, such
as other business helpdesks, and the concern would appear to be sufficiently
serious to be covered by the Public Interest Disclosure Act, this should be
investigated and managed in line with this policy.

The Post Office does not have to inform a worker who raises a concern the
outcome of any investigation and in some cases the Post Office may need to
protect confidentiality or rights of other individuals and workers. However, the
Post Office may provide an update on progress where this is deemed
appropriate.

POST OFFICE LTD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Risk Management Strategy 2013-2014

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1 Inform the committee on the current status of the Enterprise Risk Management
(ERM) framework in Post Office Limited.

1.2 Request that the Committee approves and visibly leads the next stage of the
ERM development.

1.3 Recommend approval to the Board.

2. Background

2.1 ERM has been implemented by the Post Office Risk and Compliance function
during 2012. The business has nominated risk champions and risk coordinators
in each Directorate and commenced transferring information from spreadsheet-
based risk registers into a dedicated software tool called “Stratex”.

2.2 The approach has built detailed information around risks to business objectives.
The “bottom up” approach has been moderated and used to inform the Risk and
Compliance Committee of the top risks that could potentially impact the
organisation.

2.3 The Risk and Compliance team has drafted a risk policy and is building a
business controls framework.
3. Current Situation and Action Needed.

3.1 The output from Stratex provides a partial view of top risks but now needs to be
complimented by a top down view from senior executives.

3.2 The Executive Committee to support the ERM approach and apply it across the
business. The approach will need to:

e Be proportionate to the current risk maturity of the organisation.

« Recognise the different risk profiles in each Directorate.

e Be scalable and grow with the business as it develops over the next few
years.

3.3 The Executive Committee to provide the strategic top down input to the risk
framework and to fully endorse the risk management policy.

POST OFFICE AUDIT, RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE

Regulatory Risk Framework & Controls

The purpose of this paper is to:

44

1.2

1.3

1.4

2. Background

2.1

3. Activity to date

provide the Committee with an oversight of the regulatory landscape in which Post
Office operates;

describe the control framework that exists in Post Office to manage this;

provide the committee with a view of actions in place to address any identified gaps
in the framework; and

gain the committee's approval to the proposal for review of the control framework.

Prior to separation, Post Office largely relied on Royal Mail Group to set the
framework for managing regulatory risk. As an independent company, it is necessary
that Post Office has in place its own arrangements.

3.1 A refresh of the regulatory landscape (originally documented in 2004) has been
carried out to reflect current legislation, regulation and applicable codes of practice.
This has been validated and augmented by Bond Pearce LLP.

3.2 A desktop exercise has been carried out to identify:
. The impact of the regulation on each directorate;
. The primary owner of policy for this regulation;
. The accountable ExCo member,
. Monitoring and assurance controls in place to assure compliance with the

regulation.

3.3 The impact, likelihood and aggregate risk for each regulation has been assessed
and the risks have been prioritised on this basis.

3.4 The complete landscape can be seen in the associated spreadsheet ‘filename?’

3.5 The individual ExCo members have endorsed the outputs from this exercise.

4. Outputs

44 As a result of the above activity, the following list of high regulatory risks has been
established for Post Office:

Regulatory risk Policy Directorate Policy Assurance

Owner

Significant loss of I Martin Commercial Data Protection I Annual training

customer data by I Moran Policy

Post Office

Significant loss of I Lesley Strategy (inc IT I Data Protection I Supplier

customer data by I Sewell & Change) Policy contracts

inspection
programme

42 There are no policy or assurance gaps associated with the identified significant risks.

43 The full framework of regulatory risks can be found in the associated spreadsheet:
‘Reg framework — list of applicable regulations’

44 Where a gap exists in the control framework for other risks, the accountable ExCo
member has commissioned an action plan to address this within the next 6 months

5. Proposals

5.1 It is proposed that the Risk & Compliance Team will maintain the regulatory
landscape document in its new format.

5.2 It is proposed that the current status of controls will be maintained through the
Internal Control Framework, with a report produced which will form the basis of
regular monitoring by control owners with oversight provided by the Risk &
Compliance Team.

5.3 It is proposed that a summary scorecard will be developed by the Risk & Compliance
Team with a quarterly summary provided to the Risk & Compliance Committee.

6. Recommendations

The Committee is asked to:

6.1 Confirm that the regulatory framework identified is comprehensive;
6.2 Agree that the controls in place are adequate to manage the significant risks
identified;
6.3 Endorse the approach to monitoring; and
6.4 Agree that the ARC should review the scorecard and landscape annually.

POST OFFICE LIMITED AUDIT, RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE

Treasury Risk Management: Framework, Policies and Authorities

1 Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to:

1.4

1.2
1.3

Provide the Committee with an overview of the treasury risks to which the Post
Office is exposed;

Describe the actions that are taken to mitigate these risks;

Propose a framework of treasury policies and procedures to identify, manage
and control treasury risks, including:

. The associated authorities and limits.
. The governance and reporting mechanisms.

Gain approval for the framework, policies and authorities such that the
Committee recommends to the Post Office board the adoption of this
framework, policies and authorities.

2 Background

24

2.2

2.3

On the 26" March 2012, Post Office Limited took control of its own treasury
activities from Royal Mail, but to maintain continuity and to de-risk the transfer,
retained the same approach and investment limits that had been applied within
Royal Mail treasury. There have been no breaches to these policies.

A review of treasury risks of Post Office Limited has now been carried out and
Post Office has developed its own treasury policies. This paper:

. Recommends an overall approach to treasury risk management;
. Describes the principal risks the Post Office is exposed to;

. Based on the above two points proposes a treasury management
framework, which sets out the procedures to identify, manage and
control treasury risks.

The new framework, policies and authorities will be in place by 31% March 2013.

3 Treasury Risk Management Approach
3.1 The key principle of Post Office’s treasury risk management is to minimise risk

3.2

3.3

3.4

by taking a cautious approach. As appropriate, and without compromising this
key principle, the most cost-effective solutions are sought.

The treasury management framework has therefore been designed to:

. protect financial asset values.
. minimise income statement volatility.
. ensure the Post Office can meet its financial obligations as they fall due

via appropriate short term liquidity management.

. set out an appropriate capital structure and secure long term funding to
meet overall business objectives and shareholder return requirements.

The key areas of risk that treasury manages to protect asset values and
minimise income statement volatility are:

. Foreign exchange risk - arises from the holding of currency balances in
the network and cash centres to meet “on demand” requirements from
customers.

. Commodity risk — arises from the movements in the price of diesel, gas

and electricity used throughout the business.

. Interest rate risk — adverse movements in interest rates will negatively
impact the cost of funding.

. Insurance risk - Post Office has appropriate and adequate insurance
programmes in place to cover material loss categories at optimal cost.

. Adverse movements in asset values and income statement volatility are
also created via counterparty exposures as a result of treasury and
commercial activity.

Short term liquidity management objectives are met as follows:

The Post Office has access to a £1.15 bn working capital facility provided by the
Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). Funding requirements
must be notified to BIS 2 days in advance. Forecasting variances may lead to a
shortfall between the amount drawn down and the actual amount required. The
strategy to mitigate the risk of a shortfall between notified and actual funding
requirements is to hold a liquid investment reserve of £50m and to have
uncommitted facilities of £50m available for drawdown’

In addition, Post Office is a member of the Bank of England (B of E) Notes
Circulation Scheme. The scheme allows the Post Office to declare and

" Note - As facilities are uncommitted, they may not always be available for drawdown. Actual facilities
in place are £80m but drawdown is limited to £50m per working capital agreement with Department of
Business, Innovation and Skills.

Notionally “deposit” cash with B of E reducing the Post Offices funding
requirement on a daily / overnight basis. The operation of the scheme requires
the provision of collateral facilities to B of E. These are currently provided by
RBS and total £550m split £350m intraday facility and £200m overnight facility.

3.5 Long term funding is managed through on-going dialogue with Government, to
ensure an appropriate capital structure and / or long term funding is in place
over 3 -5 year time horizon. Currently, Post Office is in year one of a three year
funding plan which has been agreed with Government. This provides the

following:

. Funding of £410m in FY 2012/13.
. Funding of £415m in FY 2013/14.
. Funding of £330m in FY 2014/15.

. Working capital facility of £1.15bn expiring on 31° March 2016.
4 Recommendation

The Committee is asked to:

« Acknowledge the treasury risks to which the Post Office is exposed

e Recommend the proposed framework of treasury policies and procedures to
the Post Office Limited Board, including:

« The governance and reporting mechanisms.
« The associated approvals and limits
5 Treasury Risks

5.1 The principal treasury risks to which the Post Office is exposed are described in
this section with recommendations as to how each risk should be managed.

5.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Nature of Risk

Post Office foreign exchange risk principally arises from the holding of currency
balances in the network and cash centres to meet “on demand” requirements
from customers.’ All currencies are purchased from FRES. The risk arises
from time of purchase from FRES to sale of currency to the customer. The size
of balances on hand is determined by historic demand.

? Pre order and online sale of currency is transacted via the Post Office JV with FRES

POL00423141
POL00423141

2. Risk Management within Post Office Limited

Confidential

Size of Risk

Post Office holds balances in 72 currencies. On average, currency holdings are
approximately £58m but can peak at over £100m during holiday periods. EUR
and USD comprise over 80% of the total balance as illustrated in the table
below.

Amore detailed analysis by currency is shown in appendix 1.

Applying a policy of hedging 90% of each currency balance over £0.5m (as
described in 7.2), leaving 10% of the balance unhedged and not hedging
balances below £0.5m, the “expected” gain / loss in the income statement
would be on the approx. + / - £0.86m based on actual currency volatility over
the last 12 months.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management Recommendation

. Up to 90% of the average forecast holding 1 month forward for all
balances over £1m will be hedged where an active FX market exists.
. Hedging of forecast average holdings 1 month forward between £0.5m -

£1m is at the discretion of the Head of Corporate Finance. Hedges will
be up to 90% of the forecast holding 1 month forward where an active
FX market exists.

. Forecast average holdings 1 month forward below £0.5m will not be
hedged.

5.3 Commodity Risk

Nature of Risk

Post Office is exposed to movements in the price of diesel, gas and electricity
used throughout the business.

Confidential

Size of Risk

The annual expenditure on commodities is approximately £8m split as follows:
diesel, £3m, gas, £3m and electricity £2m. Historically, Post Office commodity
volumes have been included within the Royal Mail hedging program and it is
intended to continue with this arrangement.

The size of annual expenditure is relatively small for Post Office Limited and
hedging of commodity exposures at these volumes would not be economic on a
standalone basis. Royal Mail has much larger exposures to these commodity
types and operates a comprehensive 3 year rolling commodity hedging program
to provide financial planning certainty for future financial years. Post Office
volumes comprise the following approximate percentages of the total hedged by
Royal Mail: diesel 2%, gas 9%, electricity 9%.

As Post Office is a small participant in the overall commodity hedging program
and the values are relatively immaterial for the Post Office, Royal Mail policies
and targets have been reviewed and are considered appropriate for adoption by
Post Office.

Current hedge position for future years

The table below summarises the current hedge position across all commodities.
For FY2013/14 forecast requirements are fully hedged, FY2014/15 is 80%
hedged and FY2015/16 is 25% hedged.

Commodity Risk Management Recommendation
. Continue to participate in the current commodity hedging programmes
with Royal Mail.
5.4 _ Interest Rate Risk
Nature of Risk
Adverse movements in interest rates will negatively impact the Post Offices cost
of funding.
Post Office funding is via a £1.15bn floating rate working capital facility from BIS
maturing in 2016. Interest is calculated at LIBOR + 0.5%. Post Office earns
commission (credited to revenue) at a rate of LIBOR — 0.125% on the balances
of benefit payments held by JP Morgan. This arrangement expires in 2015 with
an option to extend for a further 2 years. In general, the refund of benefit
payments is at least equal to the Post Office borrowing requirement as the
balances are considerably larger than the facility. The commission (interest)

payable on the working capital facility.
Size of Exposure

The net interest expense is shown below. Note, this is net interest payable and

. Continue to utilise the “natural hedge” offset opportunity provided

through LIBOR based floating rate interest payable on the working
capital facility and LIBOR based interest receivable on the refund of

benefits paid on behalf of government.

5.5 Insurance Risk
Nature of Risk
Post Office faces the following insurable risks; crime, property / business
interruption, employers and public liability, motor directors and officers and
personal accident. Post Office has appropriate and adequate insurance
programmes in place to cover these material loss categories at optimal cost.

5.6 Counterparty Risk

Summary

Post Office Limited exposure to financial counterparties? primarily results from
the following transaction types:

. Individual contracts to support Post Office financial services
activity. Exposure is primarily generated through the clearing of debit
card and cheque receipts, processing of benefit payments and
collections associated with ATM withdrawals. Total exposure approx.
£420m.

. Corporate banking and Treasury activity. Principally investment of
surplus funds (covered in the Short term Liquidity Management section
5.7 below) and settlement processing. Total exposure approx. £220m

. Over the counter cash transaction services. Withdrawals via the
Post Office branch network for retail banking customers. This creates
exposures equal to the amount paid out by the Post Office on behalf of
the bank and the commission due for providing this service to each bank.
Total exposure approx. £40m

Exposures by transaction type are summarised below:

The counterparty population supporting Post Office financial activity is shown in
the graph below. Where a counterparty is shown with a £nil exposure this is
because the Post Office always has a net payable position to that counterparty.

The largest exposures are generated by clearing activity (cheques, debit cards,
ATM's), reimbursement for the settlement of benefits and investment of surplus
funds via money market deposits.

A full list of financial counterparties and net exposures is shown in appendix 3
with activity by counterparty shown in appendix 4.

Counterparty strategy and principles

. Over the counter. Continue to grow counterparties for this commercial
offering subject to appropriate counterparty credit checks.

. Consolidate corporate banking services into a smaller number of service
providers.

. Maintain banking relationships required for geographic purposes (i.e.
Bank of Ireland and Clydesdale).

. Ensure sufficient investment funds are available to diversify risk.

. Head of Corporate Finance to approve counterparty selection for all

contracts involving financial institutions (except the appointment of new
over the counter customers).

. Counterparty selection will consider the risk arising from existing
exposures to a particular counterparty when contracts are renewed /
awarded, including the appointment of new over the counter customers.

Short term Liquidity Management

Nature of Risk

Funds in excess of daily /short term liquidity requirements are deposited with
financial institutions. A combination of money market funds and bank deposit
accounts are used to manage this together with DMO. Investment of funds
creates an exposure to financial counterparties.

Size of Exposure

The Post Office will receive a second tranche of funding of £415m in April 2013
from the government. This together with daily and seasonal cash flow variation
is likely to lead to a significant cash surplus, potentially above £500m during H1
FY 2013/14. This situation is likely to be repeated in H1 F2014/F15. The current
number of counterparties and limits will not be sufficient to allow all surplus cash
to be deposited. Credit limits by investment type / category will be increased to
accommodate the additional inflow of funds. These proposed new limits are
detailed below. The Treasury and Financial Services Committee (see section
6.1) will be updated on a regular basis and will recommend changes as
appropriate.

Short Term liquidity Management strategy and principles

. Deposits with money market funds which invest in corporate /
institutional funds limited to £250m in total. Exposure to new
counterparties will be capped at £30m per counterparty.

. Deposits with money market funds investing in Government stock limited
to £150m in total. Investments in individual funds to be capped at £50m.

. Where a single counterparty has segregated institutional funds and
government stock funds, investments can be made in both funds subject
to the limits above.

. Deposits with banks limited to £30m per banking group. The number of
bank counterparties will remain flexible to provide additional investment
capacity.

. Where possible align investment activity with other financial activity with
the same counterparty but without creating additional risk. i.e. use of
money market fund from corporate banking counterparty. RBS corporate
bank account and RBS money market fund (ensuring risks are

independent).
. Maintain sufficient funds to ensure diversification of risk.

rates on currency balances held to satisfy “on demand” transactions by
customers.

FX Risk Management Policies

. Up to 90% of the average forecast holding 1 month forward for all
balances over £1m will be hedged where an active FX market exists.
. Hedging of forecast average holdings 1 month forward between £0.5m -

£1m is at the discretion of the Head of Corporate Finance. Hedges will be
up to 90% of the forecast holding 1 month forward where an active FX
market exists.

hedged.
. The maximum maturity of financial instruments used to hedge foreign

exchange exposures will be 6 weeks.

hedging instruments.

. The Head of Corporate Finance is authorised to approve financial

. The Head of Corporate Finance is authorised to determine the currencies
to be hedged.
. Transactions to hedge exposures not created by currency holdings to

meet on demand requirements must be approved by the CFO, up to £50m
and the Post Office board above £50m.

Accounting for Foreign Exchange instruments used to hedge On demand
Exposures

Exchange gains and losses on currency balances together with gains and losses
resulting from revaluing associated hedges will be recognised in the income
statement as and when they occur. Hedge accounting and the designation of
hedging instruments to underlying exposures will not be undertaken due to the
short duration of the hedges.

7.3 Commodities Risk

Risk Management Objective

Minimise the impact on the income statement of movements in commodity

prices.

Policies

. If economic to do so treasury will hedge commodity exposures forward to
a maximum of 3 years based on forecast future usage.

. The hedging time horizon for all commodity programmes and the
associated foreign exchange will be no more than 36 months.

. Major recurring fuel oil, power and gas exposures are reviewed by the
Commodity Price Risk Management Board (CPRMB). A Royal Mail
committee which meets quarterly and at which Post Office is represented.

. Permitted hedging instruments are spot purchases, currency deposits,
forward contracts, call options, matched options (e.g. cylinders) and
swaps. Futures will not be used without specific authority of the Chief
Financial Officer.

Accounting for commodity hedges

The Post Office will designate commodity cash flow hedges against forecast

underlying exposures. Unrealised gains and losses on hedges will be deferred in

reserves. This will be recycled to the income statement when the hedge matures
to match forecast expenditure.

Approvals

. Only treasury is permitted to transact hedges to protect against
commodity price movements.

. Commodity hedging counterparties are approved by the CFO.

. Commodity hedge transactions are approved by the Head of Corporate
Finance.

Interest Rate Risk
As noted in section above the risk of adverse movements in interest rates on the

an effective natural hedge.

Any changes to this strategy will be approved by the Audit, Risk and Compliance
Committee and board.

No hedging instruments for interest rate risk management are currently
authorised.

Funding / Borrowing

Policy

Borrowing is only permitted in sterling.

Annual Report and Accounts

Chairman's Foreword

It is with great pleasure and pride that I write the Foreword to the first Annual Report and
Accounts which the Post Office has ever published as an independent company.

As this Report explains in more detail, the Post Office has embarked on a remarkable
turnaround to reverse the trend of years of declining revenues, Post Office closures and a
reputation for inconvenience and queues.

Thanks to our Shareholder, the Government, we are investing £1.34 billion into the Post
Office network over 3 years up to April 2015. There is no longer a programme of Post Office
closures. Instead, we are modernising the network, increasing our opening hours, offering
new services, developing new methods of interacting with our customers, working with our
key partners in new ways, cutting costs and increasing our revenues. All of this is intended
to put the Post Office on to a secure financial footing for the long-term, reducing our
dependence on the taxpayer to the minimum, and to change our culture so that we are
always on the front foot, responding to changes in the world around us in partnership with
the key people on whom we depend for the delivery of our services. [If we are successful in
achieving these changes, the conditions for the successful mutualisation of the Post Office
should be in place - a very exciting prospect which could in itself help to secure the kind of
self-sustaining Post Office which we all want to see in the future.]

Aseries of important changes has already happened and there are many more in the
pipeline.

We ceased to be a Division of the Royal Mail Group and became an organisation in our own
right on x April 2012. Since then, I have completed the formation of my Board and we are
now operating Board governance in keeping with best practice in the corporate world. Full
details of the Board members and our Board Committees are on p y. I am delighted to have
been able to appoint such a range of able people with varied backgrounds who are all
committed to supporting and challenging the Post Office as it pursues the changes which
must be made if we are to secure its future.

We have achieved a number of notable successes in this, our first independent, year. For
the second year running, our revenues are up on the previous year despite the difficult
economic environment. We have made great headway in our plan to modernise the network
of branches run by our agents. 1200 of these branches have been converted to new
operating models which give much better service to our customers, resulting in turn in higher

footfall and turnover. And we have made real inroads on the costs of running our Crown
offices where the annual deficit has reduced to £40 million. We have also won a large
number of new Government contracts under which we are providing some completely new
services and enabling central and local government to realise significant administrative
savings. We are also offering new financial services, maintaining our appeal to customers
who come to us for the reliability and transparency of our financial offers. [Need to say
something positive about changes in Mails]

But while we are clear about what we need to do to continue these developments and add to
them, the going is not easy. This turnaround, like any other, requires people throughout the
organisation and their partners to work in new ways. We need to win new business on
proper commercial terms - something which is difficult in current economic circumstances.
And we need to reduce our high fixed costs while at the same time finding the resources to
operate on our own two feet and to modernise and innovate - catching up after years of
under-investment.

Paula Vennells, the Post Office's Chief Executive Officer, will explain in more detail about
what we have been doing and our plans for the future in the following pages.

I would like to thank her for her commitment and hard work as well as her top team and all
the people who work to support the Post Office network for their efforts to bring about these
remarkable changes and plan for what needs to follow in the coming months and years.

I am also very grateful to Donald Brydon, Chairman of the Royal Mail, for the help and
support which he has given us as we have stepped out on our own, while at the same time
maintaining a crucial commercial relationship between us.

We owe a great deal to our Shareholder whose belief in the importance of the Post Office to
the core fabric of our country, and willingness to back that belief with real investment for the
future, is central to our plans. I would particularly like to thank Edward Davey [when did he
move???], Norman Lamb and now Jo Swinson - the three Ministers with whom we worked
particularly closely in 2012/13 and their key officials in the Shareholder Executive for their
guidance and support.

Finally, I would like to thank the people who represent many of the people through whom we
deliver our services, Andy Furey, Brian Scott and George Thompson. These are testing
times for our relationships and we all know we need to work together in new ways if we are
to achieve our shared goal of a thriving, relevant Post Office secure in its future for
generations to come. They are all important members of our Shareholder Forum where, with

colleagues from other organisations with a stake in the Post Office, they are working ona
proposed definition of our public purpose.

The Post Office has a long and honourable 350 year old history. We need to hang on to the
essence of what has made it great and made it loved, while at the same time making it fit for
the future. It is in that context that this Reports and Accounts should be seen. They report on
the first steps of progress into the future - a future which blends the trust, integrity and
accessibility for which the Post Office is renowned with the contemporary relevance,
innovation and professionalism of a financially sound 21st century company.

POST OFFICE LTD

Publication of our Report and Accounts — Key Messages

4. Background and Purpose

14 The purpose of this paper is to set out plans for the publication of the Post Office’s
Report and Accounts for the financial year 2012/13. It deals with key messages and
the overall suggested tone of the document. It also proposes a timeline for clearance
of the report and sets out proposals for the style and promotion of the publication.

1.2 This will be our first such Report and Accounts as an independent company. We
should therefore seek to surprise, to demonstrate an innovative approach and to find
ways of standing out from other such reports. This paper sets out an initial direction
of travel.

2. Tone and key messages

2.1 The report is planned for publication in June against the backdrop of tight budgetary
control within the company, a difficult external economic environment which is putting
pressure on margins and discussions with Government around future strategy and
post-2015 funding positions.

2.2 We will work to align messages in the Report and Accounts with those currently
being worked up for our future strategy (on which the Communications and Strategy
teams are working together).

2.3 Subject to that process, we propose that the tone of the report should therefore be
one of:

- solid progress on fundamentals creating confidence for the journey ahead (with a
sense that in key areas, such as Network and Crown Transformation, the
turnaround has started, albeit in difficult circumstances)

- excitement at the innovation and change capabilities of this newly independent
company to deliver commercial and social value: the spirit of a start-up

- realism as to the task ahead, and empathy with subpostmasters and colleagues
as we work together in challenging circumstances

An outline report structure appears as Annex 1. An illustration of the proposed overall
tone can be seen in the initial draft of the Chairman’s Statement given at Annex 2.
A draft Corporate Governance statement and statutory Directors’ Report are provided
at Annex 3. To provide context - at Annex 4 - we also produce a draft of what the
Financial Review within the Accounts might look like based on Q3 forecasts.
Ultimately the tone, messages and approach need to be driven by what the financial
results reported will say.

3. Key messages within the Report and Accounts Document

3.1 We are a fully independent Company — a commercial business with a social purpose
- which operates and reports to pic standards.

3.2 We have made solid progress over the past year and are on track towards financial
sustainability. Significant steps have been taken as part of this: a new Board,
progress on transforming the business, the creation of the Stakeholder Forum.

We are also creating a new culture for this new independent company: more focused
on the customer, more innovative and flexible in the face of change: a culture which
recognises our unique place in society, and listens to all those with whom we
engage.

We are developing a strategy which will position us as a multi-channel company
which remains at the heart of communities — delivering key and essential services
across financial services, mails, government services and beyond.

But we are also realistic about the challenges we face, such as the economic
environment, the di I revolution and customer perceptions around relevance and
effort. We have no illusions about the hard work ahead, but our determination to
deliver the business transformation of the decade is undimmed.

We are proud to be part of the social and economic fabric of the UK. We will work
with Government to realise the commercial and social potential of our network.

Timeline

An outline of the timetable is given at Annex 5. The structure and approach to the
report will be cleared through corporate governance mechanisms in advance of year
end with Board sign off in late May and publication from early June.

Publication and promotion

We plan to produce an annual report in such a way that it reinforces our core
communications aim of both surprising and reassuring. We intend to surprise readers
about the ways in which the Post Office is changing, but also reassure that the Post
Office retains its traditional values around trust and social purpose. We intend to
seek to reinforce these points through the style of the annual report. It will be
authoritative and comprehensive, in the way one would expect from an organisation
of our size and status, but also that it surprises: that we do things slightly differently.

We propose that traditional paper copies of the report are produced alongside an
interactive digital version. We will also produce a video version, with interviews from
the chairman, chief executive, members of staff, customers and subpostmasters.

To this end we are seeking specialist agency advice and are assessing the way in
which other businesses approach their Report and Accounts (by examining examples
of last year’s publications from a range of other companies)

In the spirit of seeking to develop an innovative approach, the content of our report
will include an introduction from the Chairman and an executive summary from the
Chief Executive but could also provide space for comments and reflections from
members of staff, customers andsubpostmasters. Involving a broad range of Post
Office people emphasises the ‘surprise’ element — few companies would take this
approach — and showcases our ways of working: engaging, listening and learning.

We also plan to commission new photography for the report and engage an agency
to support this project. Work on identifying an appropriate agency is ongoing. The
project will be funded from the communications budget.

A full PR and stakeholder plan will be developed around the report, including a
launch event which we suggest takes place outside London and with regional
elements (with Board members and ExCo involvement). The PR plan will build on the
success of the media work around our half-year results.

6. Key Risks

6.1 Key stakeholders may choose not to engage in the process, and the media plan may
lead to criticism (depending on the status of wider business issues such as network
transformation). Given the ‘routine’ nature of companies producing annual report we
will have to fight all the harder to gain media interest.

6.2 We also need to ensure we engage all relevant stakeholders in the development of
the report, at appropriate levels and with clarity around their expectations.

6.3 We will mitigate these risks through effective project planning and a flexible response
to the changing external environment. We will have a clear defined early view of what

the core Report and Accounts looks like but have scope for adjustment and flexibility
in the way we implement the media / stakeholder engagement around its launch.

Annex 2

Draft_— Chairman's statement — Post Office Ltd Report and Accounts 2012/13

The Post Office is an integral part of the social and culture fabric of the United Kingdom.

I am delighted therefore to be playing a part in another important chapter in its 350 year
history by presenting its first Report and Accounts as an independent company.

This independence is important. Setting out on our own as a commercial business with a
social purpose was a landmark step in a journey which we intend will place the Post Office
on a sustainable footing. We will be less reliant on the taxpayer, and more focused on
customers and their needs in a fast-changing world.

Our vision is of a multi-channel Post Office - embracing the innovation and agility demanded
in a digital world while also retaining our place at the heart of communities. The Post Office
is changing, and will change more, but our commitment to supporting High Streets across
the UK is unwavering.

Over the next few pages, chief executive Paula Vennells will set out the steps we have taken
during 2012/13 to set us on this path towards a sustainable future.

The thoughts of subpostmasters and staff from across the business are also included. I
thank them for their work to establish the business as an independent company.

It is they who collectively hold the stewardship of this company and it is they who have
delivered the significant progress covered in this report.

I would also like to thank our partners, particularly Royal Mail Group and the Bank of Ireland,
and also the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for its support over this period. I
would particularly like to thank the three ministers with whom we worked in 2012/13— Edward
Davey, Norman Lamb and Jo Swinson - for their guidance and support.

The year saw a number of significant developments, from the further strengthening of the
Post Office board to solid progress towards the transformation of hundreds of Post Offices of

all shapes and sizes.

Independence has also led to innovative thinking about our future. This will be reflected in a
new strategy which will articulate a vision of the Post Office in 2020. In the creation of a
Stakeholder Forum, which has brought together a wide range of organisations to define the
public purpose of the Post Office, we have started to consider how our future as a
sustainable business might be enhanced by mutualisation.

Meanwhile we are continually challenging ourselves to ensure that as we change we engage
our people - customers, staff, subpostmasters - in a way which meets these mutual
aspirations: open to challenge, prepared to change, listening and learning.

The financial picture we face as we start our journey is encouraging, albeit against the
backdrop of a difficult economic climate and ever more competitive markets. You can read
more about this in Chris Day's Financial Review on page xx.

The challenges we face mean that the Post Office must be as ready as at any time in its
history to take new approaches. We must be more adaptable and, crucially, ever more
focused on the people who matter most to our business: our customers.

The Post Office needs to become the oldest company in the UK with the mentality of a start-
up business.

It is in that context that this Report and Accounts should be seen. They report on the first
steps of progress into a new future for a new Post Office: a future which blends the trust,
integrity and accessibility for which the Post Office is renowned with the contemporary
relevance, innovation and professionalism of a financially sound 21“ century company.

Annex 3 — Corporate Governance Statement and Directors’ Report

Statement on Corporate Governance
Post Office Limited (the “Post Office”) became an independent company on 1 April 2012.
Corporate Governance Principles

As the Post Office is not a company whose shares are listed and traded on a public
exchange, it is not formally required to report on its compliance with the UK Corporate
Governance Code (the “Code”). Nonetheless, the Board of the Post Office believes this is
an appropriate benchmark for reporting on corporate governance and the following report
therefore follows the model expected of large listed companies.

In its first year of independence, Post Office has established a full Board and Committee
structure and has set principles for good governance which follow the provisions of the
Code, so far as they can apply to a Government-owned entity which has no private or
institutional external shareholders.

Legal Ownership Structure

Post Office considers its principal shareholder to be the Shareholder Executive of the
Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (“ShEx”). ShEx manages the Government's
interest through a legal shareholding in the Company, in the form of one Special
Redeemable Preference Share in Post Office Limited, issued on 1 April 2012.

A strong link remains between Royal Mail and Post Office — Post Office has a long term
agreement in place to continue to supply Royal Mail products and services through its
network. That link is currently reinforced in the corporate structure by a common Group
holding company which holds shares in both the Post Office and Royal Mail main operating
companies. This will remain in place until there is a change in ownership of Royal Mail.

ie
[ Rovat Mai}

The Articles of Association of Post Office set out the circumstances in which the Board of
the Post Office must seek the Shareholder’s consent or notify the Shareholder in advance
of proposed changes in the business. Such matters include significant expenditure (over
£20 million), entry into borrowings or financial commitments over £50 million, new areas of
proposed business and changes to Board membership.

Neither Royal Mail Holdings ple nor ShEx have any day to day involvement in the
operations of the Post Office or the management of its branch network and staff.

The Board

Alice Perkins was appointed as Chairman of the Board in July 2011, marking the first step
on the road to building an independent Board for the Post Office. Neil McCausland joined

in September 2011 as the Senior Independent Director and, in the year under review, a
further four non-executive directors have been appointed, each bringing particular skills and
experience relevant to the business targets of growth, modernisation, customer focus and

business efficiency.

The Board therefore now comprises two executive Directors and six independent Non-
Executive Directors, including the Chairman. This provides a strong level of independent
challenge to decision-making and enables the Post Office to call upon a wide range of
experience and opinion. Short biographies of all members of the Board appear on page X
of this Annual Report.

The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Office (“CEO”) and the
Senior Independent Director have each been agreed by the Board and [can be found on
the Post Office website].

All Directors’ appointments and the terms under which they serve, including Non-Executive
Directors’ fees and any changes in the total remuneration for each Executive Director,

require the consent of ShEx as the principal Shareholder.

Paula Vennells, CEO and Chris Day, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), have signed
employment contracts with the Post Office dated 29 October 2010 and 3 May 2011

respectively.

The Executive Directors’ contracts require them to devote their working time to the Post

Office. Neither of the Executive Directors is a director of any public company.

The contracts provide for 6 months’ notice of termination to be given by the director and 12
months’ notice to be given by the Company. [The standard form of contract is available for
inspection on request from the Company Secretary]. [The Company maintains rights to
claw back incentive amounts subsequently found to have been based on incorrect

accounting information. Such provisions have never needed to be enforced.]

Non-Executive Directors are not employees of the Company but provide services under the
terms of an individual Letter of Appointment, signed at the commencement of their
directorship. [The standard form of letter of appointment is available for inspection on
request from the Company Secretary.]

All the Non-Executive Directors are entirely independent of the Company, having no other
connection or financial interest in the Post Office, other than as customers and taxpayers.

Board Meetings

Formal Board meetings were held X times during the year to 31 March 2013. As well as
considering strategic plans and approving new project proposals and policies, the Board
received a financial and performance update and a report from the CEO (including health
and safety) at each meeting.

One additional conference call meeting was held during the year to finalise the extension of
the agreement with the Bank of Ireland and the sale of Midasgrange Limited (“Project
Eagle”). In addition, special workshops were held to allow greater time for debate and
increase the Board’s detailed understanding of single issues such as IT and the development
of the annual operating budget.

There is a formal Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board which includes major capital
expenditure, entry into significant borrowings, acquisitions or disposals of any material part of
business and entry into different geographic areas or business activities. These are the types
of matter which could involve significant expenditure or would require Shareholder approval
from ShEx. The Board's Terms of Reference, including the Schedule of Matters Reserved for
the Board, can be found on the Post Office website.

The Board’s primary focus in the year to 31 March 2013 was on setting the strategic direction
for the business, in preparation for completion during 2013/4 of the Strategic Plan and
Funding Agreement with Government for the period 2015-2020. Three specific strategy
sessions were held in June and November 2012 and in January 2013.

The first draft of the Strategic Plan and Funding Agreement was submitted to ShEx for
discussion on [31 March 2013]. Approval of a final plan and agreement for future funding for
the period 2015-2020, to include business targets such as objectives for the size and shape
of the Post Office network and customer satisfaction measures, is expected by [31 October
2013).

In the year under review, the Board established sub-committees which met regularly during
the year to undertake more detailed reviews in specialist areas, as recommended by the
Code. Such focus areas included accounting policy and practices, risk and controls,
executive remuneration, the processes for evaluation of performance, and the nomination
and appointment of new directors or the removal of directors from the Board; and Pensions.

Board Sub-Committees
Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee

The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (“ARC”) looks, not only at financial performance
and policies, including any changes to accounting policies and controls within the business to
ensure that the directors can fulfil their statutory responsibilities to produce proper financial
accounts each year, but also at the levels of risk which exist within the Post Office and the
steps taken to mitigate against risks.

Following its separation from the Royal Mail Group in April 2012, the Post Office has been
building its own risk management, internal control and internal audit procedures and this will
be an area for further development during the 2013/14 financial year.

In the year under review, the ARC met [3] times, under the leadership of Alasdair Marnoch.
Alasdair is a Chartered Accountant and has recent and relevant experience as a Finance
Director of customer-facing and service businesses, including recent involvement with
MyCSP, the first pensions mutual organisation developed by the Government with and for
members of Civil Service Pension schemes.

One of the ARC’s primary responsibilities during the period was to review both the half year
trading statement and the full year accounts, to assess the validity of assumptions made and
the accounting policies used and to consider the ways in which Post Office should present its
financial performance as a newly independent entity.

A second major responsibility has been to promote the development of a risk management
framework suited to the complex nature of Post Office business. This will take some time
and is a key focus area for the coming year. The development of more sophisticated risk
management and control procedures and the establishment of a full internal audit
programme are areas of high priority now that the Post Office is an independent entity.

Post Office intends to implement a full Enterprise Risk Management system to help in
assessing, measuring and mitigating against risk, where this is possible, in each of the main
business areas — the Post Office Network, Mails Services, Front Office of Government
activities, Telephony and Broadband Delivery and, perhaps most importantly, in the
developing area of Financial Services. Post Office has a target to grow its public perception
as a reputable and reliable financial services organisation.

The Board recognises that it is not possible to eliminate risk entirely. A chart showing the
principal risks and uncertainties facing the business and the steps taken to mitigate against
key risks is included in the Financial Review on page X.

In this period, a new Head of Internal Audit was appointed and the transition from using the
Royal Mail internal audit function to building a new internal team has begun. This is one
element in the re-examination of internal controls within the business.

The ARC works with both the internal audit team and Ernst & Young, the external auditor.
There is no current intention to change the existing audit relationship but the ARC will
continue to monitor the independence of the auditor and will, in future years, consider
whether the audit should be put out to competitive tender, in line with best practice applying
to listed companies.

Remuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee is made up of three Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by
Neil McCausland, the Senior Independent Director. The Committee met for the first time in
October 2012, remuneration for senior executives having previously been under the control
of the Royal Mail Holdings plc Remuneration Committee.

The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the ShEx on the remuneration
of the Executive Directors. In doing so, it also reviews the remuneration policy and packages
of the most senior leadership team, being the roles which report directly to the Chief
Executive. It also obtains information on salary levels across the business and within external
organisations of comparable size in order to set remuneration levels within an appropriate
context.

The Chief Executive may attend meetings, at the invitation of the Chairman, to discuss
matters relating to the remuneration of the CFO and members of the Executive Committee
but the Committee upholds the principle that no individual may be involved in discussions
concerning their own remuneration.

The full Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found on the Post
Office website.

The Committee is able to consult on remuneration matters with the HR & Corporate Services
Director, other members of the HR team and with external consultants. In the year under
review, advice was primarily obtained from New Bridge Street Consultants on market
practice and benchmark development. New Bridge Street Consultants have no other links
with the Company which could compromise their independence.

No material changes can be made to Directors’ base salaries, benefits or incentives without
the consent of ShEx. A priority for the Remuneration Committee in this period was to agree
with ShEx performance criteria for short and long term incentive schemes in which the
Executive Directors were invited to participate.

Further details of the schemes now in place, and a table setting out the remuneration paid to
all Directors in the year to 31 March 2013, are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report on page X.

Nominations Committee

The Nominations Committee is chaired by Alice Perkins, the Chairman of the Company. It

met for the first time in December 2012, with director appointments up to that time having
been made according to specific criteria, following discussions with ShEx.

The primary role of this Committee is to recommend to the Board any changes in Board
membership and to manage the process for recruiting and replacing directors. The Board
has only recently been completed and no immediate changes are expected. The Committee
will keep under review the balance of skills, experience and diversity available within the
Board and each of the Board Sub-Committees.

The Nominations Committee will also oversee the process for Board and Committee
performance evaluation.

Diversity

The Board believes that, at this stage of the Company's development, building talent and
diversity within the Post Office community merits special attention. The Board has therefore
delegated authority to the Nomination Committee to monitor the development of a talent
management programme and to receive regular reports on diversity at all levels of the
organisation.

Post Office does not intend to operate a quota system to ensure a fixed representation of
any particular group but will seek balance in making appointments, particularly at senior
levels.

Its general policy will be to recruit for talent, using a range of recruitment solutions, including
encouraging open applications through its own website, engaging specialist independent
recruitment consultants and operating school leaver, graduate and apprentice schemes.

Over Christmas 2012 the Post Office welcomed XXX previously unemployed individuals to

work in branches over the busiest period of the year. XXX have since taken up permanent
positions in the Company.

Pension Committee

The Pensions Solution, adopted in April 2012, saw a substantial transfer of assets from the
Royal Mail Pension Plan (“RMPP”) to the Government, in return for the Government
assuming the obligations for past service liabilities. The transfer was made possible by
European Union State Aid funding.

As part of the solution, the pension fund was sectionalised, with Post Office assuming
responsibility for setting the investment strategy for funds relating to Post Office employees
and pensioners.

The Board has delegated authority to a specialist Pension Sub-Committee to appoint
professional advisers, to enter into negotiations with the Trustees of the RMPP on the
valuation of the funds, strategic asset allocation for the Post Office sections and to monitor
investment performance. The Committee reports back to the full Board so that its work can
dovetail with executive recommendations and union negotiations on pay and benefits.

In August 2012, the Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of AON Hewitt
as investment advisers. Working with AON Hewitt and with Towers Watson, the appointed
actuary for the RMPP, the Committee has satisfied itself as to the fair value of assets
transferred into the Post Office section at 31 December 2012 and has revised the investment
principles with the aim of maintaining the long term sustainability of the Scheme and
protecting against an unmanageable increase in liabilities for the Post Office in the future.

[Further paragraphs about the implications of Project Robin, if agreed, and the valuation
exercise].

Mutualisation Sub-Committee

An additional sub-committee, open to all Directors, was established to consider future
ownership models for the Post Office, following the Government's publication in July 2012 of
responses to the consultation on “Building a Mutual Post Office’. The Mutualisation
Committee met [4] times in the period.

A summary of the valuable work undertaken to date on perceptions of the Post Office and
the steps which would need to be taken to secure a successful future, whether in an existing
form of mutual structure or a different organisational model, appears on page X.

The establishment of the Stakeholder Forum to discuss the steps towards potential
mutualisation has enabled the views of many different groups to be expressed and the Board
is grateful to all those who have contributed ideas and enthusiasm to this important project.

Independence of the Committees

As membership of the Mutualisation Committee is open to the full Board, it follows that
executive directors attend and participate fully in these meetings, though the Committee
retains a majority of independent non-executive directors. The Pensions Sub-Committee is
made up of two Non-Executive Directors and the current CFO. All of the other sub-
committees are constituted solely of independent Non-Executive Directors.

Performance Evaluation

The Board intends to carry out an annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and of
the Board sub-committees. In recognition of the fact that appointments to the Board and sub-
committees were finally completed only in September 2012, the initial performance

evaluation will take the form of an informal assessment by the Chairman and Non-Executive
Directors of overall effectiveness in the period. Separately, an appraisal of the personal
effectiveness of the Chairman will be led by the Senior Independent Director.

The performance of the CEO is assessed half yearly by the Chairman as part of the Group's
standard performance appraisal structure; the performance of the CFO is similarly assessed
by the Chief Executive. The results of performance appraisals are reported to the
Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee is then responsible for assessing
whether performance criteria for awards under the Company's variable incentive schemes
have been met and for recommending payments to be made, with the approval of the Board
and ShEx.

The Executive Committee

Below main Board level, the Executive Committee is the most senior management body and
is made up of the CEO and each of her direct reports, supported by the business unit heads
who report to members of the Executive Committee.

The Executive Committee (“"ExCo”) implements the strategy agreed by the Board and
monitors business performance and development at a day-to-day level. It meets formally at
least once a month to discuss proposals for new business development, receive financial
and other performance reports, review the results of personal performance assessments
undertaken throughout the organisation and address urgent issues which have arisen within
the business requiring senior level resolution.

Under the delegated authorities established by the Board, individual ExCo members are
responsible for the decisions taken in their own area up to a set limit [value of £Xm for
budgeted expenditure and up to £Xm for unbudgeted expenditure]. Above this level there is
a process for escalation of business proposals for approval, through ExCo as a body and the
Post Office Board and, ultimately, to ShEx, if so required by the Company's Articles of
Association.

The CEO, CFO and the Company Secretary attend both Board and ExCo meetings which

facilitates and strengthens the communication channels between the senior leadership team
and the Board and its Committees.

[The Terms of Reference of the Executive Committee have been set out in writing and are
available to download from the Post Office website.]

Insurance and qualifying third party indemnity provisions for Directors
Post Office Limited maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for the benefit of all
directors and officers of the Company.

A partial qualifying third party indemnity provision (as defined in section 234 of the Companies
Act 2006) was and remains in force for the benefit of all the Directors of Post Office Limited and
former Directors who held office during the year. The indemnity is granted under article 129 of
Articles of Association or Royal Mail Holdings plc, the ultimate parent company. The indemnity is
partial in that it does not allow the Company to cover the costs of an unsuccessful defence of a
third party claim.

The new regulations for listed companies from 2013 will require the strategic report to
include consideration of human rights issues, as well as social and community issues. It
will also require a gender split for directors, managers and employees (table to be
considered for inclusion in this year’s Corporate Governance Report under the heading
of Diversity).

People

Our goal is to ensure that all employees are engaged and involved in the business and are
aligned and equipped to meet business objectives. As part of our commitment to drive better
service for customers we continue to focus on improving the quality of our leadership,
professionalising key roles and achieving greater employee involvement in decision making.
Extensive training and development programmes have been put in place to support our ambition
to create a high performance customer-oriented sales culture. This ambition is further supported
by a range of bonus schemes which are based on the achievement of business targets.

Underpinning all of this is a need for dignity at work, where everybody feels valued, is treated
fairly and equally with everyone playing a full part in helping the Company to achieve its goals.

Regular employee opinion surveys are conducted to allow employees an opportunity to express
their views and opinions on important issues. This two-way communication encourages all
employees to contribute towards making business improvements.

Corporate Responsibility

Post Office Limited is committed to carrying out its activities in a socially responsible manner in
respect of the environment, employees, customers and local communities. [Further information
will be provided in the Business Review].

Disabled employees

The Company's policy is to give full consideration to applications for employment from disabled
persons. Employees who become disabled whilst employed receive full support through the
provision of training and special equipment to facilitate continued employment where
practicable. The Company provides training, career development and promotion to disabled
employees wherever appropriate.

Post balance sheet events
To be confirmed post year end.

Going Concern

After analysis of the financial resources available and cash flow projections for the Company,
the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate that the financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis. Further details are provided in accordance with the
fundamental accounting concept in note 1 to the financial statements.

Audit information
The Directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of
which the auditor is unaware and that each Director has taken all reasonable steps to make
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of
that information.

Summary results

The Post Office has delivered a sound performance in its first year as an independent company.

Turnover has increased in three of the four core product pillars. This has enabled investment to build

the brand and drive future growth and allowed improvements in the supporting infrastructure to the

network, however, the scale of transformational change ahead remains significant and wider economic

conditions continue to be challenging

Operating profit before exceptional items was £95 million (2012 £61 million). Cashflow was

Mails & Retail
Mails and Retail revenue of £410 million (2012: £392 million) has increased by £18 million.

Royal Mail products’ turnover has increased by £11 million driven primarily by the tariff rises introduced
by Royal Mail in April 2012. [more to add at year end on the volumes growth areas.] Retail turnover has
increased by £2 million due to the collectibles relating to the Jubilee and the Olympics memorabilia, as
well as the introduction of new products [to confirm details for year end]. Income from sales of lottery
tickets has risen by £3 million as the high number of rollover draws drove sales volumes up.

Financial Services
Financial Services revenue of £280 million (2012: £265 million) has increased by £15 million.

Personal Finance Services income rose by £22 million driven by the implementation of a new contract
with the Bank of Ireland, which has increased commissions received. Savings products have
performed well — particularly x, y and z — along with the introduction of a new mortgage product. The
value of savings held in Post Office branded accounts has increased by £x million during the year to £y
million. There has been decline in the traditional financial services products, most notably a £3.3
million decline in income from NS&I as NS&! has sought to encourage customers to use its online
channel.

Government Services

Government Services revenue of £162 million (2012: £164 million) has decreased by £2 million. There
has been [continued] growth in income from the passport check and send service which is £2 million
higher. [Rate vs volume impact to be confirmed at year end]. However, the anticipated growth in
income from identity related services has been disappointing. Revenue from the Post Office Card
Account is £5 million lower as customer numbers continue to reduce. [volume and LIBOR variances vs

Telephony Services

Telephony Services revenue of £129 million (2012:£121 million) has increased by £8 million. Income
from the Post Office Homephone and Broadband product rose by £10 million primarily due to higher

Staff costs

Staff costs of £261 million (2012:£251 million) have increased by £9 million primarily due to the impact
of separation from Royal Mail Group, which is largely offset by savings in intercompany charges from
Royal Mail Group Ltd, and some pay rises.

Agents’ costs

Agents’ costs represent almost half of the cost base and have reduced by £2 million to £481 million
(2012: £483 million). Adjusting for a one-off payment made to Agents last year of [£4] million the
underlying year on year movement would be £xxm. [Need to explain further depending on outcome.]

Other Operating Costs

Other operating costs have increased by £30 million to £425 million (2012: £395 million), driven by
additional investment to drive future revenue growth and build the brand, as well as establishing the
framework for longer term efficiencies and improving the supporting infrastructure across the Network.

Share of Joint Venture and Associate profits
Share of Operating Profit from the joint ventures (First Rate Exchange Services Limited) and associate

On 1 April 2012 — after the granting of State Aid by the European Commission on 21 March 2012 —
almost all of the pension liabilities and pension assets of the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP), built up
until 31 March 2012, were transferred to HM Government. On this date, the RMPP was also
sectionalised, with Royal Mail Group Ltd and Post Office Limited each responsible for their own
sections in future. This arrangement left the RMPP fully funded on an actuarial basis in respect of
historic liabilities at this date.

Pension Plans

Post Office Limited is a participating employer within the Post Office Section of the Royal Mail Pension
Plan (RMPP) and is a participating employer within the Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan (RMDCP).
Royal Mail Group Ltd is the principal employer of the Royal Mail Senior Executives’ Pension Plan
(RMSEPP) and Post Office Limited is a participating employer within RMSEPP. RMPP and RMSEPP
are both defined benefit plans on a career average basis.

The balance sheet pension position has changed from a deficit of £206 million at March 2012, to an
asset of £xx million at March 2013. The improvement in position is primarily due to the transfer of
almost all of the pension liabilities and pension assets of the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP), built up
until 31 March 2012, to HM Government on 1 April 2012. Since 1 April 2012 xxxxXxxxxXxXxxxx.

Both defined benefit plans are now closed to new members. RMSEPP closed on 31 December 2012
and has no active members. New employees are offered membership of the defined contribution plan,
RMDCP.

The £2 million increase in operating pension costs is caused principally by changes in market
conditions, resulting in a pension charge for RMPP equating to 17.8 per cent of pensionable pay,
compared to 17.1 per cent last year. The percentage applied to the pensionable payroll is determined
at the beginning of the financial year and is intended to represent the amount by which liabilities will
increase due to employing active members for one more year.

The net pension interest credit reflects the unwinding of the discount on the plans’ liabilities, less the
long-term expected rate of return on the plans’ assets.

Pension cash payments for all Plans

Following the transfer of almost all of the pension liabilities and pension assets of the RMPP to HM
Government explained above, the future funding of ongoing pension contributions into RMPP and
deficit payments into RMSEPP is being discussed with the respective pension trustees. The payments
for 2012-13 disclosed in the table below were based on the arrangements that were in place for the

Pension deficit recovery payments by Post Office Limited have xxxxxxxxxxx. The £1 million (2012 £1

result of State Aid clearance granted on 21 March 2012 and the subsequent transfer of almost all of
the pension liabilities and pension assets of the RMPP to HM Government on 1 April 2012.

Treasury management overview

Following the transfer of Post Office Limited from the ownership of Royal Mail Group Ltd to Royal Mail
Holdings plc on 1 April 2012, Post Office Limited has operated an independent Treasury function and
manages its own financial assets (including network cash) and financial liabilities (mainly Government
loans).

The treasury function derives its authority from the Board and provides regular reports for Board
review. It has the authority to undertake financial transactions relating to the management of the
underlying business risks however it does not engage in speculative transactions and does not operate
as a profit centre. The principal financial instruments utilised are deposits and borrowings

Facilities

The terms of the Government borrowing facilities and the associated Framework Agreement impose
constraints on the purposes for which they can be used and the availability of external borrowing. Post
Office Limited's treasury policy is to minimise the amount drawn down on the loan in order to reduce
the interest charge. The facility is limited to a maximum of £1.15bn or the amount of security available
(mainly network cash) whichever is the lower. The facility is available at 2 days’ notice.

At 31 March 2013 the company was financed as follows:

POST OFFICE LTD

AUDIT, RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE
Key management personnel accounting disclosure requirements under IFRS.
1. Purpose and background

1.41 The Post Office has decided to report under IFRS and include the accounting disclosures
expected of a FTSE listed plc where applicable.

1.2 IAS 24 ‘Related Party Transactions’ has the stated objective of ensuring that financial
statements contain the disclosures necessary to draw attention to the possibility that the
financial position of the entity may have been affected by the existence of related parties and
transactions with them. These related party transactions are required to be disclosed in a
note to the financial statements.

1.3 A person is a related party if:
e — they have control or joint control of the entity
e they have significant influence over the entity or
«they are a member of the key management personnel (KMP) of the reporting entity or of
a parent of the reporting entity.

1.4 The purpose of this paper is to define the KMP for the Post Office and to ask the Audit, Risk
and Compliance Committee to note that this is the definition that will be applied for the 2012-
13 financial statements.

x Interpretation of IAS 24

241 IAS 24 defines KMP as ‘those persons having authority and responsibility for planning,
directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director
(whether executive or otherwise) of that entity.’

2.2 Interpretation of the standard suggests that the definition is intended to include supervisory
boards and anyone who has responsibility for management of a significant part of the
business, although they may not hold the title of director. If these persons are carrying out
duties normally carried out by directors they are likely to be considered to be KMP.

2.3 Membership of a ‘management committee’, which takes decisions which are delegated to it
by the Board, is put forward as an example which falls within the definition of KMP. On this
basis it is likely that the members of the Executive Committee (ExCo) will be considered to
be KMP as ExCo has authority for planning, dictating and controlling the entity's activities
under delegated authority from the Board.

3. Disclosure requirements

3.1 The accounting standard requires disclosure of KMP compensation in aggregate and for
each of the five following categories:

e Short term employee benefits: Wages, salaries, social security contributions,
holiday pay, profit share, bonuses payable within 12 months of the year end, medical

care, car allowance. We expect that the 10/11 LTIP due to be paid in June 2013
would be disclosed here.

e  Post-employment benefits: Pensions, life insurance, medical care. For defined
contribution schemes the disclosure should be the aggregate contributions payable
into the schemes for the KMP. Where defined benefit schemes are not operated
solely for the benefit of the KMP it is difficult to calculate the total recognised cost in
respect of the KMP. An acceptable alternative is to disclose the current service cost
attributable to the KMP.

e Other long-term benefits: Long-service or sabbatical leave, any deferred
compensation not payable within 12 months of the year end. We need to investigate if
the 11/12 or 12/13 LTIP (if approved) is required to be disclosed here.

e Termination benefits: Compensation for loss of office, ex-gratia, redundancy.

e Share-based payment: Share options and other grants of shares.

3.2 In addition to the above the general disclosure requirements of IAS 24 which apply to the
wider definition of a related party would apply to KMP. Therefore any transactions, or
balances held with KMP would also need to be disclosed. This would include any of the
following transactions if not captured by the specific disclosure requirements noted above:
e Purchases/sales of goods
e Rendering/receiving of services
e Leases
e Provisions of finance (loans)

* Guarantees

3.3 It is likely that the members of the Executive Committee (ExCo) will be considered to be
KMP as ExCo has authority for planning, dictating and controlling the entity's activities
under authority from the Board. Therefore there may be a requirement for the members of
the ExCo, as well as the Board, to sign a certification to confirm the pay they have
received during the year and that they have had no transactions of the above nature with
Post Office Limited as a company.

4. Conclusion

44 It is our view that, in the case of POL, the KMP would constitute the Board of Directors
and the members of ExCo and that the above disclosures would need to be made for the
POL financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013.

5. Recommendation

5.1 The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee is asked to:

Note that the Post Office Key Management Personnel under IAS 24 is defined to include
the members of the Post Office Board and the members of the Post Office Executive
Committee.

Top priority issues and themes.

Whilst the audits cover different areas with differing issues, the recurring themes
are governance, coordination and oversight.

The business risk assurance environment will benefit by more centralised
oversight and coordination. Improved visibilty to the Risk and Compliance
Committee and ultimately the Audit Committee is required. It was
comparatively segmented at the time of the review but the Risk and
Compliance team have since commenced work to update the business
controls framework, and monitoring of processes. The terms of reference
of the Risk and Compliance Committee and its linkage to the Audit and
Risk Committee has been revised and strengthend.

o NB. The establishment of the Internal Audit function in Post Office
since the audit will assist in improved coordination and oversight.

The Information Security Framework was found to be fragmented across
POL and third parties, with insufficient POL resource which did not have
enough oversight over the security activities of third parties. The audit did
recognise some improvements since the previous review. Action is being
taken to embed better information security needs in supplier contreatual
requirements, within new products and services and to develop security
training and awareness.

o NB this audit was conducted and reported prior to the recent
information secuity review undertaken by IT.

The Post Office Finance and Supply Chain systems are operated on
POLSAP. This review assessed the general computing control
environment and also followed up on progressed raised by the 2011/12
external audit on IT security related issues.

The review noted improvements were needed in a number of areas but
none of these individually of high risk. Progress is needed to resolve
interface issues between the Post and Go system and POLSAP. Control
over leavers whose IDs still had access to the system and clarity of
ownership of the end to end change management process needed
addressing. The review also noted that some progress had been made in
resolving the SAP Security issues from the external audit. Management
have undertaken further work since that review and a short follow up of
POLSAP in February 2013 should reconfirm actions taken.

Governance and formalisation was also a theme in Supplier Contract
Management which was reported at the November 13" Audit Risk and
Compliance Committee. The review noted that further work was needed
in the overall application of standard policies and procedures and
maintenance of documentation. There were differences in the way
contracts were managed and more formalisation needed in areas such as
documentation, legal review and recording of key decisions such as
authorisations. Management had work underway at the time of the
review.

A review on specific IT areas of the Horizon system followed up on
findings from the external audit Management Letter on security

weaknesses noted in the 2011/12 external audit. These focused around
the use of shared generic user accounts which had priviged access and
security policies. Actions on these and those arising from the POLSAP:
have been addressed by IT and reported through to the Risk and
Compliance Committee.

« Strengthening of the financial framework for the assessment and
selection of branches for the Network Transformation conversion
programme was needed and is being implemented. There were errors in
the sample of spreadsheet tools used and the audit highlighted that the
batching approach used was potentially allowing some branches to pass
the tests when on an individual basis they would have been marginal or
subject to further assessment. Review and approval mechanisms are in
place and it is essential to maintain these and the improved assessment
methods given the high pace of branch conversion required.

3.4 The remaining Royal Mail internal audit activity for 2012/3 includes:

Assurance support for the E&Y payroll controls

Master Data change process review (Request from IT)

Support to the Bank of England Notes Circulation Scheme — process
narrative. (This has been been completed historically each year)

Link Scheme - Annual attestation of compliance requirement. (May
commence post March 2013)

POLSAP security controls — final follow up and check.

Appendix 4 provides a summary

3.5 The recommendations status is summarised in appendix 3. Forty four actions
have been raised by Royal Mail Internal Audit for 2012 of which as at January
2013, 18 (41%), have been reported as completed. A significant tranche are due
for completion by management through February and March. Details on the
status of each action point are available but have not been included in the papers
due to size.

Commentary:

Key Business Risk Assurance

Findings -

Developing an assurance framework: POL need to do more work to identify the assurance required by the business against that which is currently
undertaken. Analysis by POL in 2012 highlighted some key gaps, but further work is needed to ensure assurance requirements are identified and met.
Implementing an integrated assurance model: Central management of compliance and assurance across the business has become outdated and
requires more formalisation to ensure clear ownership and oversight. An updated integrated controls assurance framework is now under development.
Monitoring of business critical processes: The critical business process schedule has not been maintained nor have the processes been recently
assessed. Compliance recognised this in April 2012 and have drafted a proposal to establish a suitable internal controls framework.

Reporting to the Risk and Compliance Committee (R&CC): There was overly detailed reporting of the findings and results of assurance activity to the
R&CC making it difficult to identify significant issues. This is being addressed by the re-focus of the R&CC on key risks and issues arising from assurance
activity.

Consistency of supplier compliance assurance: Although a number of key contracts require suppliers to provide POL management with evidence that
they are meeting their contractual obligations, and allow POL to audit this information, this is not standard across all suppliers.

What is being done —

Developing an assurance framework: The key assurance requirements are to be confirmed, and any gaps in the provision of compliance and assurance
activity will be identified.

Implementing an integrated assurance model: An internal controls and assurance framework is to be developed and deployed, with executive level
ownership, which covers entity level controls to ensure against key business risks and obligations.

Monitoring of business critical processes: Critical business processes will be identified and the executive level ownership of these processes will be
confirmed and agreed. Self assessment and independent validation of these processes and the associated key controls will be defined and implemented.
Reporting to the Risk and Compliance Committee (R&CC): The revised R&CC terms of reference has been agreed. There is now monitoring of
management reporting to ensure there is sufficient focus on key risk and compliance issues for management review and direction of mitigating actions.

zs
a

Consistency of supplier compliance assurance: Standard contract terms and conditions are being developed to allow POL to maintain appropriately
transparent arrangements and monitoring of performance with all key suppliers.

Information Security

Findings -

The control environment is somewhat fragmented with control over Information Security activities spread across third party providers and within teams in
both RMG and POL. The POL Information Security team have made a number of improvements to the control environment over the past two years,
including to Payment Card Industry (PCI) requirements and risk management, and POL has a direct relationship with Fujitsu which, from an Information
Security perspective, is now well managed.

The Information Security team is not provided with sufficient information to have adequate oversight of the frequency and effectiveness of a number of
activities provided by RMG, CSC, and other third parties. These activities include user access, IT asset management, and threat and vulnerability
management. Some other activities do not have well documented audit trails and are not always undertaken in a structured manner, including compliance
management and training.

The POL Information Security function appears somewhat under-resourced. The Information Security team has recognised that investment in resources
and technology is required to alleviate weaknesses in the current control environment.

What is being done -

+ Contractual requirements for Information Security (including risk, access, asset, threat and vulnerability management) are to be embedded in the new
supplier requirements as part of the IT & Change Transformation Programme.

+ A process is to be developed to enhance and monitor the engagement between the Information Security function and new product and service projects to
ensure that Information Security requirements are embedded before the services are made available to customers.

+ Compliance with 1S027001 certification is to be reviewed and a process to monitor and performance manage compliance will be developed and deployed.

* Information Security policies are to be communicated that i) require new starters to sign-off acceptance to the user policy before being granted access and
ii) make business process owners responsible for the regular performance of user access and system role reviews. A new process will monitor compliance
with these controls.

* The accuracy of the IT hardware and software asset register is to be confirmed, and a process established to manage information assets in future.

+A process for identifying and reacting to Information Security threats is to be developed, and appropriate specialist resource will be made available to
deliver this process. Regular internal vulnerability scanning for high risk Information Security services will be implemented, including those currently
managed by RMG.

+ A training and testing strategy and plan will be implemented that incorporates annual testing, and the results will be reported to senior management.

POLSAP
Findings —

Transaction data: The responsibility for reviewing exceptions on the Paystation and Post&Go to POLSAP interfaces has not been defined. The review
identified that there are approximately 800 issues which are being investigated in relation to the completeness of the Post&Go interface, some of which are
several years old. There are no predefined service levels for the resolution of these issues specified in the contract with the third party, Wincor.

Access to software: One of the 25 new and modified user access requests sampled was not correctly documented as approved, and another request
was processed as a temporary role change in error when it was a permanent change. Further testing identified six users within the P&BA team that had
left the business but still had active accounts, and nine users where the user had a role that needed removing from their profile.

Change management: Whilst a formal change management process is in place, the responsibility for the end-to-end process has not been defined.
Sample testing identified one change that had not been communicated to the POLSAP testing team.

Supplier service provision: The scope of the monthly reviews with third party suppliers has not been defined, and the results are not reported to the
Information Security Management Forum.

The 2011/12 E&Y Management Letter identified a number of areas for improving POLSAP system controls. The IA&RM review identified that there are
some areas where further work is required, where the completed action has yet to be evidenced in the operation of the control. It should be noted that
there are some completed actions that have not been in place for the entire financial year.

What is being done -

Transaction data: Responsibility for monitoring the accuracy and completeness of the interfaces between Paystation, Post&Go and POLSAP has been
assigned to appropriate members of staff. Service level agreements between POL and Wincor for the timely resolution of transaction data errors during
the interfaces between Paystation, Post&Go and POLSAP are being drafted.

Access to software: A review of POLSAP user access in POL P&BA, Supply Chain, Steria and Fujitsu is scheduled for Q3 2012/13. The process for
identifying and taking action on POLSAP user accounts where the user has left the business is to be reviewed

Change management: All POLSAP changes that require user acceptance testing will be routed to the POLSAP testing team prior to implementation.

Supplier service provision: Third party user access reviews are to be assessed to ensure that the scope includes all areas of the application that POL
determines as priority for review. The results of the third party user access reviews will be documented within the minutes of the Information Security
Management Forum.

Outstanding E&Y recommendations: All remaining actions are to be completed by the end of Q3 2012/13. IA&RM will review this progress.

Supplier Contract Management

Findings —

Governance Policies and Procedures: Although individual working practices have been developed for each supplier contract, ranging from contract
administration to commercial contract management, there are no formal standard policies and procedures that cover the whole Contract Management
function, although these are under development. There are inconsistencies between contracts over activities including risk management, supplier
engagement, relationship management, and review of service provision.

Documentation of Changes: There is a formal process in place to ensure that changes are agreed with the supplier and POL stakeholders and reviewed
by contract management before implementation. However, contract documentation, authorisations and other key documents such as minutes of
governance meetings were often stored on local hard drives rather than in a central repository. Some authorisations are informally recorded in email
correspondence and in the sample reviewed were not always sufficiently clear to evidence whether approval had been provided.

Legal Services Review: Although Contract Managers consult Legal on contract changes, there is no agreed formal process for them to review or sign off
on contract amendments, nor is there a process for Legal to review or audit contracts on a regular basis. A formal process is currently under development
between Contract Management and Legal.

Benchmarking: The right to undertake benchmarking is not included in all key contracts.

Exit Plans: Sample testing identified that the exit clause in the Ingenico contract does not specify which party bears the exit costs, and the exit clause in
the Fujitsu contract is unclear as to how Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) to the Horizon system would be transferred to POL. The Fujitsu IPR issue is
currently being managed through the IT Transformation Programme.

What is being done —

Governance Policies and Procedures: Formal policies and procedures across the Contract Management function are under development, along with a
formal process for the risk management of all supplier contracts.

Documentation of Changes: A single document repository for all authorised changes and a process to review compliance with documentation processes
are to be implemented.

Legal Services Review: A formal process to obtain Legal concurrence for changes to contract terms and conditions is currently being developed.
Benchmarking: A process to identify and assess opportunities to benchmark key supplier performance is to be implemented.

Exit Plans: Key supplier contracts are to be reviewed to ensure that the contracts cover: responsibilities for exit costs in the event that a supplier gives
notice; licences for supplier owned software; and, access to data post exit.

Horizon E&Y Management Letter Actions

Findings -

Generic privileged accounts: Generic privileged accounts remain in use on Horizon by Fujitsu.

Password parameters: E&Y recommended that POL operate a single Information Security Policy, however POL management use two separate policies,
one for Horizon and one for POLSAP respectively.

In addition, POL management have not completed the E&Y recommendation to review key password parameters, as these have not been defined.
Testing also identified two password parameters configured in the Horizon application that did not comply with the Horizon Security Policy.

What is being done -

Generic privileged accounts: A paper was presented to the November POL Risk and Compliance Committee where any residual business risks
associated with this control were accepted by IT and Change on behalf of the business.

Password parameters: Any residual business risks associated with POL having two separate security polices for Horizon and POLSAP were accepted by
IT and Change on behalf of the business at the November POL Risk and Compliance Committee meeting.

Key password parameters are to be reviewed and defined, and the Horizon Security Policy is to be reviewed and changed to reflect the findings of this
review. In addition the process for manually changing privileged account passwords on the Oracle databases and Linux operating systems is documented
within the Horizon Security Policy.

Key password parameters will be reviewed on a periodic basis. Once defined, management will perform a review of key password parameters to ensure
that the third party supplier is implementing the Horizon Security Policy.

Network Transformation Financial Controls
Findings —
Review and authorisation of investment costs pipeline: The control that is designed to assess (pass / fail) batches and individual branches has not
worked effectively, as evidenced by:
+ Errors identified in the control spreadsheets used by Network Transformation (NT) and Finance teams (subsequently rectified);
_ + Design of the spreadsheet used by Finance is such that, on an individual basis, all branches will pass the initial review;
6. + Acommercial decision was taken to pass two batches that were escalated on the basis of the initial review. The high costs associated with branches in
2 these batches is distorting the cumulative figures that are designed to be used as part of the decision process; and,
2 + No reconciliation between the source data received from Network and that processed by Finance.
° Financial Assessment prior to the branch proceed decision: Controls are in place to prevent investment in high risk branches. However, poor quality

of documentation received from Agents, results in duplication of effort leading to delays in the process. Short term revisions to the test for risks have been
introduced and accelerated the processing of branches for inclusion in the programme. This does not weaken the control as branches cannot proceed to
contract stage without having passed the full risk assessment.

No controls have been put in place in relation to the following:

+ Joint approval by Finance and Network to proceed to contract stage. However, if the actions identified by Finance to strengthen other controls are
completed then POL should give consideration to the need for this control.

+ Review, validation and approval by Finance of all contract data prior to release of contracts for agent signature, or prior to POL signature on return of
signed contracts from the agent.

wi aanIu

What is being done -

Review and authorisation of investment costs pipeline: The existing process have been reviewed to ensure that both elements of the control (i.e.
branch and batch) are achieved. Sample checks of investment batches are to be performed to ensure they have been processed accurately within
Finance. Investment batch data is to be reconciled to that provided by the Supply team.

Financial Assessment prior to the branch proceed decision: The process for escalation of branches with one / two issues from the financial
assessment is to be documented as part of the control framework. In conjunction with the Network team a document is to be produced outlining the
financial assessment process, detailing the specific requirements for use by Agents when completing their finance assessment pack.

Other controls: The need for a control requiring joint approval to proceed to contract stage is to re-considered in light of other improvement activity listed
above. A mechanism is to be introduced to ensure that the finance information that is to be included in the agents contract is reviewed by Finance on a
sample basis prior to the contract being sent out.

2.5

The Royal Mail Internal Audit function has been engaged to provide internal audit
services while Post Office sets up its own function. The ARC on November 13
2012 supported the proposal by the POL Head of Internal Audit of three Internal
Audit Managers supported by a co-source arrangement with an external provider.
The three roles will work across the business but with some specialist focus and
background.

e Audit Manager — IT
e Audit Manager — Programmes and Projects
« Audit Manager — Network and Supply Chain

The latter two roles are more generalist and are expected to devote
approximately 50% of their time in the specialist areas.

The co-source arrangement is currently budgeted for 100 man days (half a man
year) and will support the team where specific expertise or additional temporary
headcount is needed for certain audits or reviews. All co-source staff will be
under the direct supervision of POLIA.

The Royal Mail Internal Audit team were originally contracted by management in
2012 to provide an agreed audit plan and support for 2012/13 totalling 500 man
days up to 31 March 2013.

Internal Audit represents the 3 line of defence in the model of risk management
and control. Post Office also has several functions in the 2™ line of defence,
including a Supply Chain Compliance Team who conduct compliance against a
number of external standards across the cash centres and the Field Support
Advisors who conduct audits of cash and valued stock at branches with some
compliance work. These report through to management, not Internal Audit. This
paper therefore focuses on the plans for Internal Audit.

Joins March 2013
3.1 At the time of writing, the Audit Manager - Network and Supply Chain is due to

start on March 4" 2013. Recruitment for the IT Audit manager is at interview
stage and the search process for the third role is just completing.

3.2 Due to notice periods, it is unlikely that the team will reach full compliment before
May 2013.

3.3 The business has used approximately 400 man days of the 500 originally agreed
with Royal Mail. This is mainly due to delays and some cancellations of audits
earlier in the year. Royal Mail have indicated that they would be prepared to run
this over into Q1 if required.

3.4 The co-sourcing arrangement has recently commenced tendering through
government procurement processes. This is likely to run through to May before
finalised.

3.5 Recommendation 1
It is recommended that rather than a “hard break” with the Royal Mail on the 31%
March 2013 as originally planned, that the remaining contracted 100 days be
utilised to good effect in Q1 2013/4 while the POLIA team arrives and is
inducted. The exit from Royal Mail support will be completed by 30" June at the
latest. This provides the following benefits:

e Allows POLIA to complete recruitment, proper arrival and induction.
¢ Maintains internal audit activity.
« Allows POLIA audits to commence in the branch and cash areas.
¢ Smooths the transition.
e Utilises contracted days as far as possible.
The 2013/14 plan therefore provides for Royal Mail to conduct follow up work on
its 2012 audits and complete remaining work.
The ARC is requested to approve the resourcing recommendation

5.1

5.2

5.3

The traditional approach for formulating an audit plan would take into account the
organisation's information in its risk registers, the Board’s top risks complimented
by Internal Audit’s own views based upon management input and previous
experiences and audits.

However, The company risk management processes are still evolving with
bottom up risks yet to be fully complimented by a top down review — the company
view of risk is thus still in formation. Therefore the 2013/2014 internal audit plan
has been built based on the following.

e Risks structured around risk types.

e Risks identified during induction and visits to business sites and discussions
with POL management.

« Risks documented by the risk and compliance team and presented to the
Risk and Compliance committee.

e lA review of risk registers

¢ Discussions with the Royal Mail Internal Audit team and Director.

The plan for 2013/14 recognises the following outlined in section 3.

e POL internal Audit team recruitment in progress, staff will be arriving during
Q4 2013 and early Q1 2013/2014 and going through induction.

Some finalisation to 2012/2013 Royal Mail [A work needed.

Flexible approach required.

ARC to review at each quarter.

Co-sourcing going though tender for availability post April 2013.

The need for the POL IA team to gain knowledge of PO processes through
the year.

Summary of Plan and candidate list.

The Committee is referred to the “Plan on a Page” in Appendix 1. This shows a
“candidate list” with suggested priorities. The list is deliberately more than the
team will be able to conduct in the year so that the audit committee can input on
priorities and preferences. The committee is also referred to appendix 2 which
explains the reviews in more detail.

The audit plan is currently weighted for quarters 2 and 3. This six month period
will be when the POLIA audit team gains traction. Quarter 4 (Jan to Mar 14) is
left as light to allow for changing business risks and priorities, requests from
management or the ARC which will arise or to accommodate Q3 audits that
require more time than anticipated. The plan assumes an annual man day
availability of 200 man days per audit manager but plans for 80% (160 days).

The plan should allow for advisory work and ongoing support to business areas
besides specific audits.

5.3.1. The Committee should note that the team will be involved in supporting
key areas such as the development of the risk management framework.

The plan will be reviewed quarterly with the ARC to allow for repriortisation as
necessary.

Any request received from management which upon review requires significant
resource or reorgansiation of the plan will be discussed with the Audit Committee
Chairman. Small requests that can be easily accomodated and are of sufficient
risk, will be managed by the team.

The main themes for the POLIA in its first full year are to:

+ Providing on-going assurance over the change programmes
including Finance SAP, Network Transformation, the IT Change
programme and the overall management by the Strategic Programme
Management Office.

+ Establishing stronger assurance over the management of cash in the
supply chain, supply chain compliance teams and examination of the
effectiveness of the branch auditing methods, scope and techniques

+ Focus on key IT risks including security, protection of personal data
and access and governance around the System Integration.

+ There is a mix of strategic areas complimented by assurance work
over operational areas.

Recommendations 2

6.1 The Audit Committee members are requested to:
« Review the proposed plan.
e Determine the relative priorities as suggested.
« Provide any necessary direction or amendment.
Approve the plan and the flexible resourcing approach.
6.2 An approved copy will be circulated to the Risk and Compliance committee and
Executive Committee members.

POST OFFICE AUDIT, RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE

Information Security and Data Asset Review

1. Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1. Provide the Committee with an update on developments, progress and actions with
the Information Security agenda for Post Office. It is for noting purposes only.

2. Background

2.1. Since our update to the Committee in November, we have been progressing three
strands of Information Security activity, with the majority of actions completed and a
new plan generated:

Priority action plan: this covers a range of priority activities that are focused on
improving our current Information Security controls and management;

Data asset review: this is focused on producing an initial assessment of Post
Office’s top 13 supplier/partner contracts. These were categorised by potential for
significant reputational risk should we encounter a loss of our business
information;

Independent review of Post Office’s Information Security: this was to provide an
independent view of Post Office’s information security approach and a road map
of improvement activity.

2.2 This paper provides an update and actions on each of the above areas.

3. Priority action plan

3.1. The following priority actions have been completed since November:

.

Post Office staffs have been reminded about the importance of protecting
information by Data Protection awareness communication.

The Privacy / Data Protection Governance structure has been presented and
approved by the Risk & Compliance Committee.

The Major Incident Management process has been reviewed, and
improvements have been implemented, to ensure an early alert mechanism
for escalating potential security breaches to the attention of senior managers.

The Clear Desk and Screen Policy has reviewed and communicated via the
senior leadership team; assurance activity is in place to ensure compliance.

Information Security training for new staff and annual refresher training for all
staff has been finalised and will be rolled out in March.

. The Post Office Information Security Policy has been reviewed and will be
published through the Risk & Compliance Committee.

* A Data Protection Handbook providing guidance and process has been
drafted and will be rolled out to branches via Horizon and Branch Focus in Q1.

Data Asset Review

4.1 We have continued the review of our top ranked data assets held by third parties on
behalf of Post Office. A model has been developed to enable a quantitative
assessment to be carried out and this work has identified the top-13 risk areas which
are viewed as having the highest risk of brand damage and customer privacy
protection. The core contracts have been reviewed by our external law firm, and the
Information Security risk has been assessed internally; other supplementary contracts
in the chain are in the process of being reviewed. From the review the following points
are noteworthy:

4.2 Bank of Ireland whilst not currently ISO 27001 compliant are working towards this
standard and they are two thirds of the way through the process. At this stage in the
review we have not identified any significant areas for concern, but we are continuing
our work with Bank of Ireland to understand more detail of their supply chain.

4.3 RAPP who manage and host the Marketing database for Post Office hold a
significant amount of personal and account data. We understand their security
architecture which is ISO 27001 certified and the measures they take to protect Post
Office data. We are currently reviewing the amount of customer and account data
being maintained, to ensure it is appropriate and further review of the contract is
underway.

4.4 Our top 13 contracts have been reviewed with regard to Data Protection and
understanding our position from an ICO (Information Commissioners Office)
perspective, whether we are likely to be considered as controllers of the data or a
processor. In the majority of cases the contracts are clear, however there are some
exceptions which do require further investigation. Further work is required to clarify
whether operational practices accurately reflect the contractual clauses (as the ICO
takes both into consideration), and an action plan to address any gaps will be
prepared.

4.5 Most third parties have capped their liability in relation to data issues and in some
instances there are specific exclusions or limitations in addition to a cap. Where the
core contract forms part of a larger chain (e.g. POCA) there are two instances where
Bond Pearce have identified that our entitlement to recover from the third party is
capped at a sum lower than our potential liability to the end customer (POCA / HP and
DVLA / Cogent). In terms of indemnification for data issues, we benefit from
indemnities in some but not all of the contracts reviewed; some of these indemnities
are uncapped (e.g. Cogent) - which is in our favour.

4.6 The first stage of the review is scheduled to complete at the end of February, and
the minimum Information Security standards will be implemented for all top 13
contracts and an action plan for our suppliers will be agreed during March.

Information Security — Independent Review Findings

(1S027001/2)'. The high level findings have been agreed. The details are currently
being reviewed by all key stakeholders within Post Office and a detailed plan
encompassing the activities currently underway and future road map has been
prepared.

The key findings from the review are as follows:

e The Information Security team is significantly under resourced and there is
insufficient internal resource to provide appropriate security input into new and
on-going projects; or assurance activities with our key suppliers/partners. The
recruitment of a Head of Information Security is underway, and to support our
recent separation from RMG additional security specialists are being recruited.

e We do not have a comprehensive view of the Information Security risk
environment and the existing Information Security policy set is incomplete.
There is a mixture of legacy RMG policies and gaps in the policy set.

« On-going training and awareness across Post Office is not currently proactively
managed and there is no rolling security awareness campaign of Information
Security policies.

e There is a need for greater oversight and a formal assurance programme of our
third parties Information Security controls. Whilst there are some assurance
activities such as PCI (Payments Card Industry) compliance testing and
governance structures for our suppliers/partners, it is not consistent. A standard
framework is required for the management of Information Security controls
operated by third parties.

e There were gaps identified in the existing Information Security governance
forums, it is recommended that an Executive level forum will be created which
will report through to the Risk & Compliance Committee quarterly.

Deloitte have recommended an action plan, outlined in Appendix A. This has been
reviewed by the project team to assess the level of resources and support required.
In addition, we have aligned the plan with the activities currently underway. The plan
includes:

* Mobilising the Information Security team to ensure that the POL Information
Security objectives are met, with clear accountabilities and structure.

e Improve the Information Security risk control and review framework, which will be
aligned to the wider risk activities across Post Office.

¢ Implement a high level Information Assurance Strategy and supporting policies,
and wider monitoring and compliance to the Data Protection Act.

e Develop a framework of security management (including audit rights and clarity
of contracts) for our suppliers, and implement controls to address the risks
inherent in legacy contracts.

1. Bank Capital Requirements

POL00423141

POL00423141

Bank Capital

The difference between the value of a bank’s assets and its liabilities. The bank capital represents the net
worth of the bank to investors. The asset portion of a bank’s capital includes cash, government securities and
interest-earning loans like mortgages, letters of credit and inter-bank loans. The liabilities section of a bank's
capital includes loan-loss reserves and any debt it owes.

Bank Capital is made up of Tier 1 capital (Core Tier 1 (now Common Equity Tier 1) capital and non-Core Tier
1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. The most critical of these is Tier 1 capital.

Tier 1 Capital

+ The predominant form of Tier 1 capital must be common shares and retained earnings. The remainder of
the Tier 1 capital base must be comprised of instruments that are subordinated, have fully discretionary
non-cumulative dividends or coupons and have neither a maturity date nor an incentive to redeem.

* Common Equity Tier 1 must be at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets at all times.
* Tier 1 Capital must be at least 6.0% of risk-weighted assets at all times.

* Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 Capital) must be at least 8.0% of risk weighted assets at all times.

3. Bank Liquidity Requirements

POL00423141

POL00423141

Bank Liquidity

Cash and other financial assets that banks possess that can easily be liquidated and paid out as part
of operational cash flows. Examples of core liquidity assets would be cash, government bonds and money
market funds. Banks typically use forecasts to anticipate the amount of cash that account holders will need to
withdraw, but it is important that banks do not over-estimate the amount of cash and cash equivalents
required for core liquidity because unused cash left in core liquidity cannot be used by the bank to earn
increased returns.

The Liquidity Adequacy Rule, the Individual Liquidity Guidance, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the
Net Stable Funding Ratio

Liquidity Adequacy Rule
= “4 firm must at all times maintain liquidity resources which are adequate, both as to amount and quality to ensure
that there is no significant risk that its liabilities cannot be met as they fall due” — FSA BIPRU 12.2.1R

= “4 firm must ensure that it maintains at all times liquidity resources sufficient to withstand a range of severe stress
events which could impair its ability to meet its liabilities...” - FSA BIPRU 12.2.3R

Individual Liquidity Guidance

= At least annually a Bank must carry out an Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment, which is then
reviewed by the FSA (the Supervisory Liquidity Review Process or SLRP). The outcome of this process is
the FSA's Individual Liquidity Guidance (ILG), which sets out the FSA’s guidance as to the amount and
composition of the liquid assets buffer a bank should hold.

= If this is breached and a remediation plan not agreed then the Guidance can turn into a Requirement

3. Bank Liquidity Requirements

POL00423141

POL00423141

The Liquidity Adequacy Rule, the Individual Liquidity Guidance, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the
Net Stable Funding Ratio (continued)

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)

= From 1% January 2015 the LCR will come into effect, replacing the measures employed by the FSA but still
managed by them or by then the FCA & PRA. Revisions to the minimum standards have been agreed on
6 January 2013. The LCR is part of the Basel III framework.

= The LCR aims to ensure that a bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered high quality liquid assets
(HQLA) which consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in
private markets to meet its liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario.
= The range of assets that can be included in the HQLAs has been widened as part of the new changes,

ostensibly to try and free up bank lending and prevent a return to global economic recession.

Net Stable Funding Requirement (NSFR)

= The NSFR requires that available stable funding (equity and liability financing expected to remain stable
over a one-year time horizon) at least equals the matching assets, i.e. Illiquid assets which cannot be
easily turned into cash over the following 12 months. As a result of the agreement on the LCR the “Group
of Governors and Heads of Supervision” (GHOS) will now focus on developing the NSFR framework.
The aim is to introduce the NSFR in 2018.

5. Post Office termination rights in the FSJVA a
As previously presented to the Board, Post Office has a termination right if: &
= Bol’s minimum core tier one capital ratio falls below the threshold; g
= Bol fails to maintain liquid assets required by the regulator; J
= Bol breaches the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) (to the extent that these rules apply to Bol when they become 3
operational from 2018); or
= Bol, or its parent, becomes insolvent.
To support these rights, Bol must inform Post Office immediately of any threshold breach; failure to do so is in
itself a breach of the contract.
To provide the Post Office with some notice of the potential that Bol may breach a termination benchmark,
Bol must provide Post Office with regular updates of its financial position, including:
= Formal update on its capital and liquidity status and immediate notice if it becomes aware of any capital or liquidity issues
that might give rise to a termination event.
= 15 days after each public announcement of annual and half yearly results and any interim management statement Bol must
provide a certificate stating:
= Its Minimum Core Tier One Ratio, the actual Core Tier One Ratio and any Common Eauity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital buffers or
other requirements applicable to Bol;
= Bol’s regulatory liquidity requirement and its position against the benchmark;
= Any NSFR requirement and Bol’s position;
= That Bol is not in breach of the termination obligations, or of any remediation plan agreed with the regulator.
= After each half year financial announcement a senior Bol executives must provide a trading performance update.
= Bol must provide a presentation of its annual results, including a summary of any Recovery and Resolution Plan (RRP)
submitted to the regulator and summaries of any ARROW Letters received from the FSA as far as they relate to the Post
Office or Bol’s obligations to the Post Office. ()
