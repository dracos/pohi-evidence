Hi Jamie, Jason,

With thanks to those in copy, please find attached Ministerial advice seeking agreement for
officials to develop an appeals mechanism for the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS).

We will be submitting Accounting Officer advice on this issue to the Permanent Secretary
shortly, following final clearances. AO clearance is required before proceeding.

As highlighted in the advice, the Secretary of State or Minister Thomas will need to send a
letter to CST to request funding. We have attached a copy of that letter to this e-mail.

Lead private secretary: Jamie Cunningham
