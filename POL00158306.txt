TRINITY STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS PLAN FOR W/C 22 FEBRUARY

POST OFFICE CONFIDENTIAL
POL00158306

POL00158306

Trinity stakeholder communications plan — week commencing 22 February

Post Office intends to terminate legally with IBM and sign a contract extension with Fujitsu on Friday 19 February. The required OJEU notice will be sent to
OJEU on Friday night. Any outstanding negotiations with IBM will carry on in the background. This raises the (low) risk that we may need to manage
negativity from IBM or their subcontractors in the wake of the termination.

The communications approach for the publication of the OJEU notice continues to focus on ensuring that those directly impacted by the decision are well-
informed about rationale and specific personal implications.

Post Office are in the process of agreeing a joint message with IBM. In the event of any unforeseen pronouncements from IBM or their subcontractors,
before this joint messaging is agreed, we will maintain a fact-based, reactive stance reiterating the reasons for our decision, while pointing out that talks are
ongoing and that we therefore cannot comment on any detail. Our strategy will remain short and sharp, and designed to shut down questioning. This
approach is outlined in Annexe H below.

We will remain reactive with wider audiences until the issue of the OJEU notice; beyond that we will move to proactive approaches with carefully targeted
stakeholders as outlined in Annexe A. We will continue to monitor and review our proposed approaches for each stakeholder group but all communications
will remain measured in tone and delivered where possible as part of BAU relationship mechanisms.

Our overall communications positioning is constructed to make the development uninteresting in news and political terms, and to underline that there is no
change to our ultimate aim to enhance what we do for customers and to demonstrate continued effective programme management. It is also designed to
manage potential ‘disappointment’ about continuing with Horizon, amongst the very small minority who have high awareness of the IBM alternative.

Our current messaging (and therefore the key positions we will be seeking from IBM and BIS) is summarised below:

e Annexe A - positioning across stakeholder groups

* Annexe B- our core narrative for internal audiences

e Annexe C — our reactive messaging

e Annexe D — post-OJEU Q&A’s for external stakeholders

« Annexe E-a more detailed set of post-OJEU Q&A’s for internal audiences

e Annexe F —a proposed timetable of briefings to be completed once the Board has made its decision (NB: this is a work in progress)
e Annexe G — targeted briefing notes for use with identified audiences
POL00158306
POL00158306

e Annexe H— communications strategy in the event of IBM or a sub-contractor communicating a different story

The next phase of the communications plan will be to develop our key messaging and strategy around Trinity 2. Given that messaging will be heavily
dependent on both the timescales for the current business review, and the scoping and business case decisions taken as a result, our approach at this point
will be to:

Develop a positive story around the benefits which Trinity 2 will deliver to our business and our customers
e Identify the key audiences, internal and external, who are impacted by these benefits
«Create a strategy to deliver the appropriate messages to these audiences at the right time

We will develop this strategy in close consultation with project leadership.

Annexe B: core statements
Core internal narrative

As you know, our Transformation journey aims to make us better for customers, simpler to run and a great place to work. A key element of that journey is
the enhancement of our customer-facing technology.

Through the work we have been doing on point of sale software, it has become clear that we can achieve our aims for the future by retaining and
developing Horizon. We have therefore decided to end the front office software development contract we have with IBM and we are modifying our
existing contract with current providers Fujitsu.

This step, which is being taken after rigorous assessment, reflects our commitment to make our technology simpler to run, whilst at the same time it offers
better value for money. It will enable us to make our planned changes more efficiently and within a shorter timeframe, so we will begin to see commercial
benefits earlier.

‘Simpler to run’, among other things, means making change as straightforward as possible. Our new approach means we can roll out new hardware in
branch but continue to benefit from our robust, efficient (and obviously familiar) Horizon software.

Our decision is underpinned by the new information and knowledge that has resulted from the planning, scrutiny and testing of the past six months. This
has shown that we can achieve what we set out to with the IBM contract but at reduced risk and cost. Developments by Fujitsu can provide the same

functionality we had planned, along with the capability to upgrade in future.

Existing contractual arrangements with Fujitsu mean that that we are able to move forward immediately with this decision, which is in the best interests of
our branches, our business and above all our customers. To do so we are issuing a change notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.

We will continue to keep you updated and please do ask us any questions you may have.
POL00158306
POL00158306

External Post Office statement [reactive — to be reviewed against nature of enquiry]

Post Office’s Horizon computer system is robust and effective and continues to serve the business and its customers well, processing around six million
transactions a day at 11,500 Post office branches in communities throughout the UK.

It makes sense to retain and develop this system for the future, as we continue to adapt and innovate in fast-changing marketplaces. Following extensive
and rigorous assessment we are therefore modifying our existing contract with Fujitsu, who currently provide the system, to deliver the changes we will
need for the future, such as providing better capability for introducing new products and services more quickly.

This decision is underpinned by new information and knowledge through valuable work undertaken over the past six months, including that of IBM, with
whom we have been working. Our approach means that we will be able to make planned changes more efficiently, producing significant savings.

We can confirm that we have therefore agreed with IBM to end their contract with us.

External IBM statement [to be agreed with IBM]

We can confirm that we have reached agreement with Post Office to end the contract to provide new front office software for the Post Office network.
Both Post Office and IBM recognise that this is the right step to take in the wider context of the work being taken forward to transform the Post Office. It
has always been recognised by both companies that, as for any major and complex programme, the project would be subject to continual review and
assessment which could result in changes of approach.

POL00158306

Annexe D: key questions and answers for external stakeholders
Q. Why are you ending your contract with IBM?

A. Our work over the past [six] months, including work with IBM, has produced new information and knowledge. We have rigorously assessed our options
and it has become clear that we can achieve our aims by retaining and developing our existing Horizon system. We are therefore modifying our existing
contract with our current provider Fujitsu. The decision will enable us to make planned changes more efficiently and within a shorter timeframe, so we will
see commercial benefits earlier.

Q. How much has been spent on IBM’s work to date and over what time period?

A. Commercial contracts with suppliers are confidential. Post Office is subject to rigorous standards to ensure value for money and this is always a prime
consideration when assessing options and in fact our approach will produce significant savings by enabling us to make planned changes more efficiently and
within a shorter timeframe, so we will begin to see commercial benefits earlier.

Q. How much is it costing you to get out of the contract with IBM?

A. Commercial contracts with suppliers are confidential. Post Office is subject to rigorous standards to ensure value for money and this is always a prime
consideration when assessing options and in fact our approach will produce significant savings by enabling us to make planned changes more efficiently and
within a shorter timeframe, so we will begin to see commercial benefits earlier.

Q. Is this not evidence that the procurement process — that took three years — was mismanaged?

A. Not at all. A major programme such as this will always be subject to continual reviews and assessment as it progresses and six months of valuable work
with IBM has informed our options.

Q. How can you say that IBM’s work on software development has been ‘valuable’ when you are essentially starting again?

A. The work carried out with IBM has played an important part in informing our options about how we deliver the future capability we need to enhance
what we do for our customers. With new knowledge and information we have gained we are able to take an approach which will produce significant
savings by enabling us to make planned changes more efficiently and within a shorter timeframe, so we will begin to see commercial benefits earlier.

13
POL00158306
POL00158306

Q. How can you justify staying with Horizon and Fujitsu?

A. It makes sense to retain and develop a system which is a robust and effective system, currently processing around six million transactions a day in our
UK-wide network of 11,500 Post Office branches. Under their existing agreement with us, Fujitsu have been developing upgrades to the system which
delivers the future capability we need, offering us an opportunity to develop our relationship further with Fujitsu.

Q. How long is the new contract with Fujitsu for?
A. Six years, with a break clause at 4 years.
Q. Why don’t you have to go out to tender this again?

A. We have issued a Change Control Notice (CCN) under Regulation 72(1)(b) of the Public Contracts Regulations. This effectively allows us to extend the
timescale of the current Fujitsu agreement, and extend the scope, to include the enhancement of the software and a number of related services.

Q. What is the Government’s view of you ending the IBM contract?

A. The management of the programme is an operational matter for the Post Office. The programme supports the overall strategy for the business, agreed
with our shareholder. It is being carried out to ensure standards and value for money.

Q. What reaction have you had from IBM?

A. This was a commercial contract and it has always been recognised by both IBM and Post Office that, as for any major programme, it would be subject to
continual review and assessment, which could result in changes regarding how we deliver the future capabilities we need to enhance what we do for our
customers.

POL00158306
POL00158306

Annexe E: proposed, more detailed questions and answers for internal briefings
Q: Why have we decided to dispense with IBM’s services?

A: Since late last year we have been reviewing the business case for updating our point-of-sale software. We took into account the overall Transformation
picture, the shift in timescales and increased costs of delivering the planned solution. We have also developed a better understanding of the risks and
impact of the planned change. After detailed discussions we agreed with IBM that we need to take a fresh approach. IBM have been very professional in
recognising the changing nature of our business case and helping us to arrive at the right conclusion for our customers and our business.

Q: So what does that fresh approach look like?

A: We have been looking at a number of options for upgrading point of sale software, and have decided that an evolutionary approach presents the best
opportunity to maximise benefits while minimising risk. We are now proposing to retain and enhance our existing Horizon software, in partnership with our
current supplier Fujitsu.

Q: Why have you come to this decision after initially deciding to replace Horizon?

A: As our incumbent supplier, Fujitsu already have a long-standing relationship with us and understand our business requirements. There was never any
doubt that Horizon is a robust and effective system to support our current day-to-day operations, but we believed that in order to build in future capabilities
we would need to bring in a new system. Fujitsu have now confirmed that the capabilities we are looking for can be delivered through a new version of
Horizon that they have been developing, offering us an opportunity which wasn’t available at the time of the contract award.

[Alternative] Q: So why didn’t Fujitsu get the contract in the first place?

A: IBM were awarded the contract following a full OJEU public tender process. Since then IBM have helped us to develop our understanding of how to
deliver the change in such a way as to maximise the benefits and minimise disruption. This has led us to conclude that an alternative approach would be
more appropriate. At the same time, Fujitsu have been developing upgrades to their Horizon product which delivers the capability we need, offering us an
opportunity to develop our relationship further with Fujitsu.

15
POL00158306
POL00158306

Q: If we’ve decided that Horizon meets our needs after all, why are we spending money on upgrading it?

A: Horizon is a robust software that meets our day to day needs. What the current version of Horizon doesn’t give us are the capabilities we need for the
future — for instance the ability to anticipate future customer needs and bring new products or services to market more quickly and easily. Initially we
believed that to have this capability we would need to move to a different software provider, but development work by Fujitsu has meant they can now
confirm that they can deliver what we need by enhancing Horizon.

Q: What is the implication for our branches — does this mean they will see anything different?

A: We already have a robust, secure system in place. We will be installing new point of sale hardware into all our branches, while still using Horizon. We
will work with Fujitsu to deliver further flexibility that enables us to meet future customer demands as they evolve.

Q: Does this mean we have to go out to tender again?

A: We have issued a Contract Award and Modification Notice under Regulation 72(1)(b) of the Public Contracts Regulations. This effectively allows us to
extend the timescale of the current Fujitsu agreement, and extend the scope, to include the enhancement of the software and a number of related services.

Q: Terminating IBM is surely going to cost a lot — how can we justify it?

A: Our agreed approach will deliver significant savings in the short and mid-term by enabling us to deliver the planned changes more efficiently and within a
shorter timeframe. As a result we will begin to see the commercial benefits earlier.

Q: When will the programme be finished now?
This decision will enable us to complete the programme broadly within our original timescales, i.e. by the end of 2017
Q: Does this mean the Branch Technology Transformation programme as a whole has now been stopped?

A: No, there is still a great deal of work going on which is not affected by this decision. We have started work on reviewing a wide range of core services, to
see where we can make processes simpler and more effective. We are also moving ahead with our EUC Branch programme to update point of sale
hardware in all our branches.

16
POL00158306
POL00158306

Q: Will this decision impact on other parts of the Branch Technology Transformation programme?

A: No, we are still moving ahead with our EUC Branch programme to update point of sale hardware in all our branches. We are also reviewing a wide range
of core services to see where we can make processes simpler and more effective. Neither workstream is impacted by this decision.

Q: Does this mean you’re laying people off?

A: In pausing the programme we have taken care to minimise the impact on permanent or contract colleagues. Wherever possible, colleagues have been
redeployed on to other Transformation programmes. [To confirm — how many people have we let go as a result of this decision?]

Appendix H: contingency plan in event of IBM or sub-contractor communicating a different story
Background

In order to sign the extension of the Fujitsu contract without delay, it may be necessary to complete a ‘legal termination’ with IBM while negotiations on
termination terms are ongoing. We are conscious that this may lead to IBM or their sub-contractors (who will be directly impacted by the termination)
making unhelpful public statements.

This risk is mitigated both by the proposal Al Cameron has tabled with IBM, for a joint statement, and by the fact that it would not be in IBM’s interests
commercially to make negative comments. Nevertheless we need to be prepared for such a situation should it arise.

Communications strategy

In the event of a joint statement not being agreed with IBM and/or any unhelpful public statements from IBM or any subcontractors and suppliers
(including ‘off the record' briefings), our strategy will be to avoid any public argument or detail that might escalate a story. In the highly unlikely event of
IBM aggressively attacking our stance, our strategy will remain reactive; we believe the most effective response in such a scenario will be to starve the
attack of oxygen.

Our messaging is summarised below, in the shape of four potential scenarios.
Scenario 1 - general query

Q: Can you confirm that you have terminated your relationship with IBM?

A: It is not our practice to comment on ongoing commercial discussions
Scenario 2 - IBM adopt aggressive/critical stance

Q: How would you respond to [criticism] from IBM?

A: We respect our partners and commit to working with them in accordance with our contractual rights. Our overriding imperative, in undertaking a large
programme of work like this, is to ensure that we are developing the best and most cost-effective solution that we can for our business and above all our
customers.

32
POL00158306
POL00158306

Scenario 3 — decision to terminate becomes public
Q: Why did you not come to this decision earlier?

A: We have taken a responsible decision under the terms of our contract with IBM that is in the best interests of the Post Office, its people and its
customers. The option we are taking gives much greater value for money at lower risk. We have taken the decision to now end our contract with IBM after
rigorous assessment and with the benefit of new information and knowledge that has been obtained from our work over the past six months, including
work with IBM.

Scenario 4 - Sparrow-related press approach
Q: Surely your split IBM reflects the poor state of your Horizon systems and your failure to deliver a viable alternative?

A: This decision is the result of rigorous assessment and with the benefit of new information and knowledge that has been obtained from our work with IBM
over the past six months. Horizon is a robust, effective system that continues to serve the business and its customers well, processing around six million
transactions a day at 11,500 Post office branches in communities throughout the UK. Fujitsu have been able to demonstrate that by developing our exiting
Horizon system, we can deliver the changes we need for the future. We have therefore taken a responsible decision under the terms of our contract with
IBM, to retain and develop our existing system.
