Shirley (and Kath)

Please find attached my comments on M029. You will have seen most of these comments previously —
POL00125093

POL00125093

my only recent changes are to the "training" and "summary" sections of the Executive Summary.

The changes reflect the advice we have received from Cartwright King (attached) about making
concessions. In essence:

If POL concedes in any case that its old processes were inadequate, then this concession may
need to be disclosed to any SPMR involved in a criminal case. We therefore need to be very careful
about doing this as it will have significant consequences.

If POL concedes that its old processes were not followed in a specific case due to the specific
circumstances of that case, that raises a small risk of needing to make a criminal disclosure. This
should be ok but we would need CK's view on this on a case-by-case basis.

If POL concedes that the outcome of a case may have been different under its current practices
(eg. under current practices POL would have intervened earlier, etc.) then that should be ok.

In practice, the investigators (and my team here) need to be careful about how they phrase any
concession to make sure it accurately describes the situation in questions. Otherwise, we risk getting tied
up in unnecessary discussions about criminal law disclosures. You'll see that CK have provided some
suggested "safe" wording in the attached document.

Kind regards

Angela, Shirley

Please find attached BD's comments on M029, which is looking good.

We haven't run this case past CK yet for legal sign off because a one of the points made in this report
may cause them concern.

The report notes that POL could may perhaps have intervened earlier in this branch. I ran this scenario
(just as a hypothetical question) past CK earlier this week and they have responded saying that this could
cause a serious criminal risk (see attached.)

I'm meeting CK on Tuesday at 10am at Old Street to discuss this issue in more detail (you're more than
welcome to attend but they've schedule this for 2 hours so you may want to leave the lawyers to it in the
first instance!).

I've attached the report anyway so that your investigator can have a look at the few other points raised.
However, this report cannot go out until the above issue is sorted.

If you'd like to discuss before the CK meeting, please do feel free to give me a call.

Kind regards

Andy
