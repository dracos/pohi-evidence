Dear Emma,

We prosecute on behalf of the Post Office in this matter.

Please find enclosed the case summary relating to Mr Ishaq's case.

Please note Mr Ishaq pleaded guilty to theft of £17,863 of Post Office money and not the amount on the
indictment of £21,168.64. This basis was accepted by the court. The defendant pleaded guilty at the
beginning of the second day of his trial.

Should you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards,

Fernando Rodrigues
