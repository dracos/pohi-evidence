Dear Sir Greg

Thank you for your letter of 14 November to Paula Vennells about the Initial Complaint Review and
Mediation Scheme and your constituent, Mr Lee Castleton.

I would like to clarify that Post Office has never indicated that it would be willing to mediate in all
cases where Second Sight recommended mediation, I can also confirm that Post Office has had no
direct contact with Mr Castleton since he entered the Scheme either about mediation or any other
matter.

However, the Scheme is overseen by a Working Group with an independent Chair, Sir Anthony
Hooper, and comprises Justice for Subpostmaster Alliance (JFSA) Post Office and Second Sight. I
have therefore passed your letter to Sir Anthony Hooper who may wish to respond.

Yours faithfully

A
