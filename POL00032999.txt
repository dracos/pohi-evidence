o ACCEPTANCE REPORT FOR HNG-X ACCEPTANCE GATEWAY 3 “i
FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1. Introduction

This document comprises the HNG-X Acceptance Report to the HNG-X Acceptance Board for the
assessment of the progression through Acceptance Gateway 3 (AG3) — Readiness for Pilot.

The basis for HNG-X Acceptance is defined in Schedule B6.3 and some sections are reproduced within
this report.

The POL Requirements and Criteria, contained in the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue - POL DOORS
archive v1.42, and associated with AG3 are contained in Appendix A.

The definition of the HNG-X Acceptance Methods is contained in Appendix B.
The definition of the Acceptance Incident Severity is contained in Appendix C.

1.1. Scope
The purpose of this Acceptance Board is: -

‘To agree the Acceptance status of the relevant Release (HNG-X Release 1 for AG3) and provide a
recommendation to the ‘Joint Release Authorisation Board'.' The proposed options that this Board can
select from are described in Appendix D.

This recommendation is based on an assessment of the status of the applicable POL Requirements and
Acceptance Criteria and of the stage progression criteria for AG3 are described in Schedule B6.3.

The primary assessment concerns the status of any Acceptance Incidents as follows:-

Progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3 shall occur once all of the following have
been satisfied for the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria allocated to achieving progression through the
respective HNG-X Acceptance Gateway:

(a) subject to paragraph 4.6 (of Schedule B6.3 which refers to dispute handling, defect
aggregation and deferred tests), all such HNG-X Acceptance Criteria have been achieved;

(b) activities leading to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 1 (named “Readiness for Router Roll—
Out (Z1)” and HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 2 (named “Readiness for Data Centre Migration”)
must be completed and these two HNG-X Acceptance Gateways passed through in accordance
with paragraph 4.5.4.2 as pre-requisites to achieve HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3.

(b) there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance Incidents;

(c) the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents is five or fewer
and an agreed workaround exists for each of them; and

(d) there is an agreed workaround for all outstanding HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance
Incidents except for those which the Parties agree do not require a workaround.

(e) details of all Non Incidents are recorded, although they shall have no impact upon
Acceptance Gateway progression

These together with other supporting factors are summarised in the following checklists for AG3.

It should be noted that there are also defects that are not linked to POL Requirements and which are not
the subject of Acceptance Incidents. A separate assessment of the status and significance of these has
been undertaken and this will be available for consideration at the Release Authorisation Board.

Sequence.

The sequence of HNG-X Acceptance Process stages and the order of

Passage through both AG 1 &
precedence for Acceptance Gateways is defined in schedule 6.3 section 2.2 AG2

The HNG-X Acceptance Plan.

For all HNG-X Requirements, Fujitsu Services is responsible for
producing, within the timescale agreed between the Parties,
evidence to demonstrate that the relevant HNG-X Acceptance
Criterion has been met.

4.6.4 If, other than as a result of a Default of Fujitsu Services, it
is impossible for a test to be carried out when scheduled in the
HNG-X Acceptance Plan then that test becomes known as a
"Delayed Test". The non-occurrence of a Delayed Test at the
time originally scheduled in the HNG-X Acceptance Plan will not
prevent HNG-X Stage Progression, HNG-X Final Acceptance or
progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1 or 2.

Delayed Tests.

4.6.4 Delayed Tests will be carried out as soon as reasonably
practicable or at such later time as the Parties may agree
(which shall be no later than six months after HNG-X Final
Acceptance) provided that performance on that agreed date
does not, other than as a result of a Default of Fujitsu Services,
become impossible (in which event the Delayed Test shall be
carried out as soon as reasonably practicable).

Contract Schedule 6.3 will need revising (from v1.0) to change
the reference from Deferred Test to Delayed Test.
Achievement, Fulfilment & Compliance.

Gateway progression shall occur when 4.5.4.2 (a) subject to
paragraph 4.6, all (such) HNG-X Acceptance Criteria have been
achieved.

Tests have identified a number of HNG-X Acceptance Incidents
and these are summarised below. Otherwise, (and with the
exception of Delayed Tests), Test demonstrate that all other
HNG-X Acceptance Criteria have been met.

With the exception of those
tests agreed to be Delayed
Tests, all tests have been
carried out when scheduled in
the HNG-X Acceptance Plan.

The total number of
Requirements with one or
more Delayed Tests equals:

Fulfilment and Compliance.

With the exception of those
Requirements with Delayed
Tests and those that are the
subject of Acceptance
Incidents (noted below), all AG
3 Acceptance Criteria have
been achieved (4.5.1.1(a)).

1.3 Acceptance Decision

The AG3 Acceptance Board (AG3-06) was held on 21/01/10 and approval to proceed through AG3 was
granted. The decision stated that ‘...it was agreed that the high priority fixes in “Reset 4” - to be
delivered as part of Maintenance Release 01.08 — could constitute a High Severity Al if not delivered in
time for High Volume Pilot (over 272 branches). As such, “Qualified Acceptance” at AG3 was agreed,
subject to the successful delivery of the high priority items in Reset 04.

Whilst not an exact match, this is the closet to the Acceptance Board Recommendation 3: ‘Proceed at
risk through Acceptance Gateway.’

These associated conditions were discussed at the corresponding Release Authorisation Board and
recorded in the minutes of that meeting.

Key to Status

Failed (Deferred Fix) — This indicates that a Use Case has one or more defects associated with it, but
that the resolution of these defects have been agreed to be deferred to beyond start of Pilot.

Failed - This status indicates that a Use Case has one or more defects associated with it that has not yet
been resolved. See section 2.4.1. (Note that in this case these all relate to test reference data issues and
are classed as Non-Incidents).

Applicable defects are represented as Acceptance Incidents in section 3.

2.3 Delayed (Deferred) Test status

The Schedule B6.3 acknowledges that there may be circumstances when previously scheduled testing
that was targeted for completion by this Acceptance Gateway cannot now take place. Providing that this
is not due to a contractual default by Fujitsu, and the parties agree, then the tests associated with a POL
requirement may be delayed — this is known in the contract as a ‘Deferred Test’. Fujitsu are still obliged
to carry out these ‘Deferred Tests’.

For this Acceptance Gateway, Either Fujitsu or Joint Test Team has requested that tests associated with
the following requirements are given this ‘Deferred Test’ status. Quality Centre does not record this
status and so the current QC status is shown for each criterion.

2.3.1 Delayed Test Status - non-testable criteria

3 Review of status of Acceptance Incidents

The Acceptance Incidents listed below have been raised because the acceptance evidence has failed to
meet the acceptance criteria. They have been classified into three groups: -

e Those arising from defects whose resolution has been agreed to be deferred until after
the start of Pilot. These have an identifier of Al-AD-nnn

e Those arising from defects that have been raised during the assessment of the non-
testable criteria - in this case Document Review. These have an identifier of AI-NT-nnn.

e Those arising from defects that have been raised during testing and where no formal
deferral discussions have taken place. These have an identifier of Al-TS-nnn.

3.1 Acceptance Incident Aggregation

Schedule B6.3 (4.6.3) recognises that HNG-X Acceptance Incidents that are agreed to result from the
same failure or deficiency, or to affect the same operational process or business function, may be
aggregated into a single HNG-X Acceptance Incident for the purposes of the thresholds identified in
section 1.2. The following sections contain details of all of the individual Acceptance Incidents and then
identifies where aggregation has occurred.

B_ Definition of Acceptance Methods

The set of HNG-X Acceptance methods are defined in Appendix D of Schedule B6.3 HNG-X Acceptance
Process and reproduced below.

Type Description

HNG-X HNG-X Acceptance Criteria that cannot be objectively verified by a test of HNG-X
Document may be satisfied by Post Office undertaking a HNG-X Document Review. The
Review outcome of any such review will be documented by Post Office in the HNG-X

Acceptance Tracking Document. Fujitsu Services will supply a list of documents.
(and any specific references within such documents) for Post Office review,
which may satisfy the agreed HNG-X Acceptance Criteria.

HNG-X HNG-X Acceptance Criteria may be satisfied by Post Office participating in an

presenting the results of the tests.

HNG-X Tests that are run and managed by Post Office with significant collaborative
Release support from Fujitsu Services, for the purpose of verifying that the HNG-X
Validation Release satisfies the relevant HNG-X Acceptance Criteria. The combined team

will produce a joint test report presenting the results of the tests and provide

C Definition of Acceptance Incident Severity

The definition of the severity of an HNG-X Acceptance Incident is defined in Appendix A of Schedule
B6.3 HNG-X Acceptance Process and reproduced below.

High The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that would render a key element of
one or more of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or a key element of the
Infrastructure unfit for operational use, which could include:

a) not allowing Post Office to undertake one or more Transaction types;

b) not allowing Post Office to undertake one or more Transaction types using the
required business inputs or generating the required business outcome;

c) creating system performance issues which are in, or are likely to cause a, breach
of Service Level Targets.

Medium The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that would not prevent operation of
one or more of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or elements of the
Infrastructure, but would cause problems in the operational use of one or more
Transaction types.

Low The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that does not cause any adverse
operational impact in the use of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or an
element of the Infrastructure, or the HNG-X Acceptance Incident can be addressed by
a workaround without any adverse operational impact for Post Office.

Non An incident raised by either Party which, following investigation is found:

Incident

> not to be a defect;

> not to have resulted from the introduction of changes arising from Project HNG-X
and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the HNG-X
Acceptance Process; or
