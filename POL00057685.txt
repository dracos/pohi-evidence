Hi Al

Paul Southin does not start his new job until the 14" May, so thought I would just drop him a line to see if
he attended the confiscation hearing. Just spoke to Dave Posnett and he states that Paul didn’t attend the
hearing as he has been of sick for the last couple of weeks, Dave has drafted a response but is hoping
Paul will return on Monday as he has all the info locked away so will update then.

I believe that Paul has left and moved onto another job hence why I have asked Dave Posnett for an
update

Hi Paul
I refer to the latest developments below, could you please confirm if you attended the confiscation
hearing? Also I know that Ms Misra’s house had been re-possessed and back in January was being sold,

do we know how much this went for and where the money went? Obviously if the house was re-
possessed then Ms Misra would not have received any payment from the sale.
