David,
Although we have missed the target exit date (31° October), which is disappointing, the situation is:

* Stephen has been kept fully updated.

* Counting only those that we have agreed to count, the estate is at 98% functioning
* We have on a daily basis jointly agreed to delay red alert testing

« We did enter red alert testing with RMG approval today

* RMG & Fujitsu are working very well together and jointly tying to “get the win”

Sorry to burden you with this!
