system generates, whether it is for external ‘consumption’ or for
internal working purposes is also in attribute grammar format in the
form of conventional Riposte message This document describes, in

Scope

The scope of the document is limited to message data written by both
the Riposte Desktop and the desktop application The message store
is a ‘write-once’ file and therefore each message, once written, cannot
be amende Messages remain in the message store for a period
specified in an ‘Expiry’ attribute that is written with each messag When
the expiry period is reached, messages are ‘archived’ from the
message store by Ripost This is in contrast with ‘objects’, whose
currency persists until they are deleted or replaced by a later version
of the objec

Message Structure

Messages are made up of ‘Core’ and ‘Extended’ attributes of which
some attributes or attribute groups are defined as optiona The core
attributes apply to all Messages (and Objects); the extended attributes
apply to specific Message

Riposte Forced Logout

Usage

This message is written by the Riposte Desktop software to record a
user logout which has been initiated by the system detecting that the
specified inactivity and ‘forced logout’ periods have been reached.
The inactivity period is the time after which, if no user interaction with
the system has taken place, the system will execute a ‘temporary
logout’. During this time the user may log back in to the system by
entering the correct password for the current user. If, after a further
‘forced logout’ period, there has still been no user interaction with the
system, the Riposte Desktop logs the user out and commits to the
message store any transactions currently on the desktop stack. The
transactions are settled by the ‘selling’ of the appropriate product for
the type of session in force at the time, or ‘Cash’ if the session is a
normal ‘Serve Customer’ session.

4.40 Public End of Day Marker
4.40.1 Usage
This is the marker written to the message store to identify the logical
end of a business day. The marker is written only by the ‘Gateway’
node (Node 1) and is only written if all the nodes in the outlet are
communicating successfully at the time that the EOD marker is due to
be written. The writing of the EOD marker is determined by reference
to the closing time for the outlet, specified in POCL reference data.
The marker is written at current day closing time + 30 minutes or at
19:00 if no closing time for the current day is specified. If no all nodes
are communicating at the time the EOD marker is due to be written, a
‘private’ EOD marker is written instead.

4.41. EPOSS Parcel Traffic Transaction
4.41.1 Usage
This message is written by the EPOSS software to record the details of
transactions to be reported to Table 12 of the Cash Account. These
transactions differ from normal EPOSS transactions in that the value of
the transaction for accounting purposes is ‘zero’ and the value entered
during the transaction is recorded in only so that it can be accumulated
to table 12 during Cash Account production. The exclusion of the
transaction value from the normal accounting values is achieved
through the use of special ‘<PM:> attributes which do not accumulate
to the normal balance hierarchy.

transaction which equates to the service provided (e.g. ‘International

4.48 EPOSS Declaration Discrepancy Transaction

4.48.1 Usage

This is an EPOSS accounting transaction which identifies a
discrepancy between the value of a product which the system has
calculated from transactional data and the value declared by the user
during the declaration process. The transaction mode will be either
‘DDN’ (where the transaction is reducing the current stock holding
value) or ‘DDP’ where the transaction is increasing the stock holding.
These transactions are written with a compensating ‘Loss’ or ‘Gain’
transaction (Products 145 and 222) and represent the stock unit
discrepancies. The transactions are written at the time a declaration is
made if the stock unit is of type ‘Individual’ and at the time of preparing
the Trial Balance Report if the stock unit is of type ‘Shared’.
