authorisation for a specific transaction should be sought.

It is now used to group NB101 and NB102 reports together. It is set up in Post Office

Run Date This is the System Processing Date for which the report refers, i.e. all transaction
components processed by the DRS on System Processing Date dd/mnvyyyy are
accounted for on this report.

Settlement Date Settlement Date is often the same as Run Date but some Financial Institutions may
assign a Settlement Date in the future: e.g. the following Monday may be set on
transactions processed on the preceding Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

1. Introduction

This document has been compiled to specify Fujitsu Services outputs from the Data Reconciliation
Service (DRS) and the Automated Payment Service (APS) so as to enable a generic end to end
reconciliation of

1. Banking and Related Services transactions, which includes DCS and ETS
2. Automated Payment System (APS)

2 Scope

This document defines the format and content of all reconciliation reports for HNG-X, which satisfies the
DRS and APS reconciliation requirement. It does not attempt to define within the operating systems how
the transactions are processed.

This document does not attempt to define the business processes undertaken within Fujitsu Services and
Post Office Ltd. with respect to the resolution of any exceptions which may arise, nor does it scope the
requirement for any systems that may be required to assist in this process. This information can be
found in the associated documents, reference:

e SVM/SDM/PRO/0012: Reconciliation and Incident Management - Joint Working Document

3 Network Banking Reconciliation (including
Payments and ETU)

3.1 Overview
The purpose of Network Banking Reconciliation is twofold
e To provide information to Post Office Limited to allow them to settle with clients, and,

e Toconfirm that the Post Office view of transactions that have taken place matches the Fl's view
of transactions that have taken place. Where differences in these views occur then appropriate
action is taken.

Settlement is based on the client's data. Post Office receive files from the clients (or their representative,
Vocalink, in the case of Banking) providing their view of transactions that have been carried out and their
financial values (described as C4 files). Post Office then settles with the clients using the total values
within the C4 files. The DRS converts the C4 files into NB101 reports, ignoring any ‘D’ records.

The NB101 report for Banking is adjusted to reapportion transactions to the appropriate Post Office client
using an input file received each day from Vocalink. This is needed as some Post Office clients share
BINs so the total figure for a BIN as derived from the LREC file received from Vocalink must be split
between the clients sharing the BIN.

Reconciliation hinges on a unique identifier, hereafter referred to as ‘OTR’, assigned to each transaction
as it is carried out at the counter (or other device) within the Post Office estate. The DRS relies on this
OTR being quoted within the C4 files to be able to match the transactions reported by the clients with the
transaction records created with the Post Office estate known, as the C12 records.

Whenever the DRS receives the first transaction part for an OTR then a status record is created for that
OTR.

When a further transaction part is received using that OTR then the status record is updated and a
history record created showing the previous state,

FUJ00235004

FUJ00235004
ee) End to End Reconciliation Reporting
FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

When, as does happen from time to time, DRS receives a further C4 with that OTR a child record is
written to the status table. This ensures that there will be a record in the status table for every C4 record
received in the files from the clients.

3.2 Reconciliation Paths

This section describes the expected paths through the state table which is shown in section 3.3 below.

3.2.1. Normal path

The ‘normal path’ for a transaction is that it is carried out at the counter, generating a C12, anda
matching C4 record is received in a subsequent file from the FI shortly afterwards. Whilst the real
sequence must always be that the C12 is generated before the C4 is received it is quite normal for the C4
to be loaded into the DRS before the C12 as DRS receives its data in batches rather than real time.

The happy path therefore covers both options, with DRS receiving the C12 before or after the C4, and the
values on the C12 and the C4 match.

For these transactions the status recorded in the DRS is 100,

3.2.2 Zero value C12

Where a transaction at the counter or equivalent device does not proceed the technique of writing a zero
value C12 may be used as a means of recording the fact. Depending on circumstances this may result in

* NoC4 from the client (status 102)
e A zero value C4 from the client (status 103)

« Anon zero value C4 from the client followed by an equal and opposite C4 cancelling out the first.
This is explained further in section 3.2.4 below.

3.2.3. C12 followed by a C12 reversal

In some instances an initial C12 will be reversed by a C12 reversal (status 101).

Following this a zero value C4 may be generated (status 105).

3.2.4 C4 followed by a C4 refund

Following receipt of a zero value C12 from a PBS counter it is possible to receive a non zero value C4
from the Fl followed by an equal and opposite C4, cancelling out the first, in the same or a subsequent
C4 file.

The possibility of this path was introduced with PBS payments. When a payment is initiated by the
counter but then fails to complete, a zero value C12 is written and a request to undo the transaction that
was initiated is sent to the Ingenico data centre.

The state changes for the sequence where the zero value C12 arrives before the C4 and the C4 refund
are:

0 -> 102 => 4 => 106/107

When the C4 and the C4 refund arrive before the C12 has been harvested then the state changes are:-
0->2->5-> 108

3.2.5 ’ record

An FI may include a failed transaction in the C4 file sent to DRS. This indicates a failed transaction and
is converted into a D record in DRS. This is expected to match to a zero value C12 from the BRDB.

The normal path covers the options of DRS receiving the D before or after C12.

For these transactions the status recorded in the DRS is 99. These are monitored and manually cleared.

3.3 State Tables

This section lists the possible states that can be recorded against a transaction identifier.

3.3.1 Non exception states

This section identifies the states which are generated in DRS which are not Exception States.
States with values of 100 or greater are expected and/or benign and do not require monitoring.
States 1 — 5 do not indicate a problem unless an individual transaction stays in the state for too long.

This table identifies the NB102 series report section where incomplete and discrepancy States are
reported in detail.

4 This state is expected, albeit rarely, for PBS payment I 1&5 7811
transactions as explained in section 3.2.4, above.

This state is generated when, following a zero value C12 a
non-zero value C4.

Expect an equal and opposite C4 to complete (state 106)
plus generate a 107.

5 This state is expected when a C4 reversal is received I 1&5 7&11
following a C4 (but no zero value C12 has been
harvested).

Expect a zero value C12 to complete (state 108)

99 Any transaction where a D record has been received I 2 8
should end in this state; D records may also lead to an
Exception state. A D record will have no impact on any
settlement figures.

100

Matching C12 and C4 received.
This is the normal reconciled state

101

A C12 has been received followed by an equal and
opposite C12 indicating that the transaction has been
reversed at the counter.

This is an acceptable end state which does not require
investigation.

A zero value C4 may be received in this state (resulting in
state 103).

102

A zero value C12 has been received indicating a
transaction cancelled at the counter.

This does not require investigation

A zero value C4 may be received in this state (resulting in
state 105)

In the case of PBS payments a non zero value C4 may be
received resulting in state 4.

103

A zero value C4 has been received following a cancelled
C12

104

This indicates a duplicate zero value C4 following a zero
value C12. This indicates a technical problem in that
duplicate C4s are being generated but as the value is zero
there is no financial impact and so this does not require
investigation.

This state occurs reasonably regularly for ETU
transactions.

105

This indicates that a zero value C4 has arrived after a
reversed C12.

This does not require investigation

106

This state arises for a PBS payment transaction which was
cancelled at the counter where the ‘undo’ message did not
get to the Ingenico data centre in time and a payment
request was sent to the FI resulting in a C4. The payment
was subsequently refunded resulting in a second C4 for an
equal and opposite amount — and this state.

This does not require investigation

107

An entry in this state is created at the same time as a state
106 is registered for technical reasons.

Its purpose is to ensure that the OTR Status table is
consistent with the C4 tables in terms of volumes.

108

This is the final state when a C4, a C4 reversal and then a
C12 arrive in that order.

It will occur when a payment is made and then reversed at
the counter, resulting in a zero value C12 being sent to the
data centre, but the C12 is not harvested before the C4
and C4 reversal are received.

3.4.1. Reapportionment Reporting

PCI rules dictate that only the first 6 digits of a PAN (known as the BIN) can be stored and processed
within the Horizon system.

Some of the BINs supported by PBS are shared between different Post Office banking clients
necessitating a mechanism to reapportion transactions to the correct client(s).

Therefore, for Banking transactions, a reapportionment report (RAR) is received each day from Vocalink
covering banking transactions for the period of the corresponding LREC file which have a BIN which is
shared between Post Office clients. This file indicates which client the specific transaction is attributable
to.

It is expected that for every transaction in the RAR there must be a corresponding LREC file where the
record is a payment or a receipt. The RAR file will also include non-financial transactions (Balance
Enquiries and PIN changes) which are not in the LREC.

It is expected that for every record in the LREC file which has one of the shared BINs there must be a
record in the RAR.

DRSv2 processes the RAR file and records the following exceptions in its internal tables:

Exception Type Meaning

4 Record found in the RAR with no matching record in the corresponding LREC
file.

2 Record in the RAR for which the corresponding record was in an earlier LREC
file.

3 Record in the LREC file with no matching record in the RAR.

4 Record found in the LREC file for which the corresponding RAR record was in
an earlier RAR.

3.4.2 Settlement Reports (NB101)

DRSv2 produces a Settlement report (NB101) for each application each day to include all C4 files which
have been received since the last NB101 report was produced.

The report is broken down into sections according to Routing Gateway which is maintained in Post Office
reference data. Many Post Office clients can map to a Routing Gateway, with a row in the report for each
client.

Where the NB101 covers multiple Settlement dates each Settlement date is listed separately within
Routing Gateway.

3.4.2.1 NB101: Rules
e NB101 is run daily
e NB101 is broken down by Routing Gateway
e NB101 is broken down by Client within Routing Gateway

e NB101 will show ‘C4’ transactions received for ONE day only — breaking these down into
individual ‘C4 Settlement Dates’. There will be one line for each ‘C4 Settlement Date’

« NB101 will show Deposit and Withdrawal transactions in separate columns, (headed ‘Receipts’
and ‘Payments’ respectively) derived from ‘Txn_Type’

e NB101 will show a final settlement column derived in the following way:

Where the net total is negative i.e. the Value of Withdrawals exceeds the Value of
Deposits, the total will be shown as negative

e Where the volume for a given ‘C4 Settlement Date’ is nil, the date will not be reported.

3.4.2.2 NB101: Reapportionment

The position with regard to the RAR is reported on the Banking NB101 report in a column headed
RAR_Status. The following values may be reported:

Value Meaning

<blank> No RAR is needed for this LREC client, or the RAR was received for the LREC
client and there were no errors.

Waiting RAR The RAR file has not been received for this LREC client.

Missing RAR The RAR file was received for the LREC client, the RAR had some exceptions of
type 3.

3.4.3. Exception Reports (NB102)

NB102 reports are produced to detail exceptions which may require investigation and resolution. Historically NB102 reports were produced with 12 sections, but with
the introduction of DRSv2 this has been rationalised to eight.

Original section numbers are used to maintain continuity.

Many exceptions reported in Sections 1 to 6 will be resolved automatically when further C12 and C4 files arrive. Those that don't will be investigated and then
‘Cleared’ manually and given a state of F99. Where an exception has been manually cleared it will be reported in Sections 7 to 12

With the introduction of DRSv2 sections will be produced as follows:

Sections 1,2,5 and 7,8,11

One report for each application broken down by Routing Gateway (as for NB101) will be produced daily for each section, giving a total of 18 reports.

Sections 6 and 12

One report covering all applications will be produced daily for each section - i.e. 2 reports. These reports will normally be empty.

4 APS Reconciliation

On-line Counter, SSK and HiH Automated Payment transactions are committed to the Branch Database
during the customer session settlement process at the same time that the Auditable Journal records are
written. The Journal Records contain a dense set of Journal Sequence Numbers that prove no
transaction is missing or duplicated.

Offline/External Automated Payment transactions (such as Paystation transactions) are delivered in
file(s) via PODG on a daily basis. These files contain a sub-file for each Branch that contain value and
volume totals that ensure the integrity of the data contained therein. These are validated during the
transaction posting process to ensure no data loss or duplication.

The AP transactions from all data-sources are copied to a dedicated APS data store where they are held
pending their delivery to the AP Client via AP Client Files.

Note 1: AP Transactions that are mapped to Client Account No “9999” do not get delivered to
any Client.

Note 2: AP transaction performed on certain devices (Such as Payzone) do not get delivered to
any Client.

At the end of each Trading Day, all transactions for the day are validated and any transactions failing
validation will be moved to a Quarantine area. Validation failures include the following scenarios:

Invalid Negative Value

Negative values are only allowed for reversal records or if the Delivery Agreement
indicates that the transaction is an Out-payment transaction.

Unmatched Reversal

This is a reversal record where the corresponding original transaction is not present on
the current Trading Day. This may occur in certain counter recovery scenarios.

Missing Delivery Agreement

Delivery Agreement reference data controls the creation of AP Client Files. If the data is
missing for any client then the transactions cannot be delivered and will be quarantined.

Duplicate Transaction
Duplicate transactions are not expected and can only occur in the case of system bugs.

Quarantined transactions can be viewed and processed using a Graphical User Interface available to
Fujitsu's third-line support team. Where transactions were quarantined due to missing or invalid
reference data then the transactions can be moved back into the main processing stream once that
reference data has been corrected. These transactions will then be delivered to the AP Client. In the
case of an unmatched reversal, since the original transaction will almost certainly have been sent to the
AP Client then a manual activity must be in place to inform the AP Client that the payment has been
reversed. The transaction will then be archived as “manually processed”

Note 1: The BRDB Transacted value will not include transactions for Client Account = “9999" or those transactions where the Device Type signifies that the

Note 2: The Value delivered in Client Files is summed-up during the client file creation as each record is written to the file. The total for each file is recorded in the file
audit trail. Some client files include the reversals and reversed transactions and some do not. Either way, these transactions balance-out in the calculated
totals. This is not the case for File-type “BT” that includes the reversed transaction only and these have to be taken into account during the calculation of the
Client Files value.

The discrepancy columns should always be zero and an automated alert will be raised if ever this is not the case. The alert will cause an incident to be raised for
investigation.

In addition to reporting transaction values, the Branch Database also records transaction counts and raises an alert if the transaction counts do not tally. The counts
can be reported using HORIce.

When adding up transaction counts, the transacted reversals are added as positive values. However, in many cases, reversals and their reversed counterparts are
not delivered to the AP Client. This is a recognised scenario during the production of a Client File and Reversed/Reversing transactions that are withheld from the
Client Files are updated to status “Reversed (Not delivered)”. During the reconciliation of transaction counts, these transactions are counted as being dealt with
appropriately (ie: seen, understood and marked as processed).

Transactions that are performed on non-Horizon terminals are delivered to AP Clients via the Branch
Database and the APS Service. These transactions are loaded into the Branch Database and are
validated at this point to ensure that subsidiary Horizon systems can complete all necessary processing.
Transactions that fail validation are prevented from being loaded and are automatically returned to the
transaction supplier.

Due to this validation, there should be no further transaction processing failures within the Horizon
service.

However, there is a possibility that an external transaction is queried by an AP Client. This may occur if
the customer who performed an AP transaction queries or disputes the amount of the transaction. In
these instances, Fujitsu would receive the initial query but can only trace the transaction back to the file in
which the transaction was supplied. It is almost inevitable that this type of query will need to be routed
back to the transaction supplier for resolution.

This re-routing will be performed by raising a call with the Post Office Limited Service Desk.

Areport is supplied to Post Office Limited called the Rejected Sub-Files Report. Report Description:
Ordering of the report is Load Date followed by Trading Date.

The Times Rejected column will indicate how many times that the sub-file has been rejected and will
indicate whether there is an ongoing problem with poor quality data in corrected files.

If the quality of the data in the external transaction file is good then we would not expect any output from
the report.

Reconciliation for external transactions is the responsibility of P&BA not the Post Office Account
Reconciliation Service. However, in the event that entries persist on the report the Post Office Account
Reconciliation Service will contact P&BA to ask for these files to be cleared.
