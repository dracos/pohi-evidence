Spoke to Diane she will speak with her team leader
about liaising with the police in the Wendy Lyell
case. She is not convinced that Wendy Lyell is
responsible for the vast amount of the £59k. This
is because she lives in rented accommodation in a
quite run down area of Hull, with no signs of any
sort of high life. In addition Miss Skinner did not
report to anyone that she was short as would be
expected if she was not responsible for the thefts.

8 Dec 06

Spoke with Thea at Kensington Mortgages to ask if
the house owned by Miss Skinner was valued at the
time of the increased Mortgage. Thea asked for a
DPA, which I agreed to do. Spoke to Diane to
clarify what the position was in respect of the
charge was. Dianne stated that it is a case of
wait and see what happens to Wendy Lyell, but in
any event the committal is sufficient to re draft
the theft charge as false accounting if appropriate
later. In any event we will have to know the value
of the house before we decided on pursuing a
Confiscation order so DPA Fax sent (8)
