Cheers. The MDA negotiation wouldn't really affect that as it would be removing penalties that RM shouldn't have banked, and
small efficiency payments in the future. Not big deals for them in terms of the prospectus, at least I wouldn't think so.

Btw - I have just seen Richard Hatfield. He was generous and understanding. We have agreed a payment for 4 days - I suggested 5,
he said 3, so I settled on 4.

He had been v interested in the work, so I expect there could still be an opportunity re a challenge session for the new ToR. I
mentioned in passing but said it was not a proposal currently and if it materialised, I would get back to him.

A lovely man, And, I am sure we would benefit from his contribution at some future stage.

the Hansard of last week's Parliamentary debate to see how important that will be politically. So I am sure Jo S would swing into
action on this if it were necessary.

discussed; that is how the indemnity came about. They were then informed in November last year that we would be going to market.
And this year, the teams have been in frequent conversation, as we have been requesting information from RM re Romec staff
numbers engaged in delivery of PO services. This has probably escalated because of the prospectus and their requirement to disclose
business risks.

not happy with the content: although it may be legally accurate, it is not helpful reputationally. (Ironically, we have enough branches
signed up to cover the distribution though.) I'll keep you posted.

>> I agree about telling Neil about the MDA. We are short of bandwidth to re-negotiate this and it does seem a little late in the
process..... But if it meant that RM was in a weaker position (Big If) and we could win some big issues from them, it might be worth
it.

>> I was glad to hear your reassurances about Board involvement on this and on the cliff etc. And very glad to hear the better news
re Susan. I know you intend to speak to her today - good that you are doing that quickly if she is really in a better place.

>> Iam on the train to see Charlotte with loads of PO papers to read...
