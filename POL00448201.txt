1.1 Attendance should be arranged for the post incident Branch Assurance Visit (BAV) to be
carried out at the earliest possible opportunity after the initial report of the incident from the
Branch Support Centre (BSC). The Branch Assurance Support Team (BAST) should
ensure that the lead BAA attending the incident, is sent the Post Incident Report which
contains brief details of the incident.

SECTION 1 - Branch Assurance Manager Responsibilities

If the branch is a Strategic Partner (SP), the BAST should inform the relationship manager
for that SP (a list of the relationship managers can be found on the Knowledge Centre — z.
Admin — Contact Information - Multiples Account Information).

If the branch is a self-funded PO local, a BAV may not be required if cash only has been
taken. If stock has been taken, then a BAV would be required if the amount taken exceeds
£1000 of stock value.

Whilst in most cases there is a need for a BAV to be conducted as soon as practicably
possible, the branch should be contacted to ensure that BAV attendance is acceptable. It
should be noted that such incidents are traumatic experiences, and the circumstances may
not allow for immediate attendance, particularly at serious incidents.

1.2. A Major incident is classified as follows —

. Loss >£50k

* Firearm discharged

. Injury to staff or public requiring hospital attention
. Hostage incident

. Serious structural damage to premises

° Incidents at Crown Offices

. Any incident involving and ATM.

No compliance testing should be carried out at serious incidents. The fact that no
compliance testing has been carried out should be recorded on the Branch Assurance

Reporting Tool (BART).

1.3 Scheduling BAV’s out of hours (weekends/after 6pm)
e In exceptional circumstances this should be agreed by the Branch Assurance Manager.

1.4 For incidents where the loss is expected to be less than £1000, no BAV need be conducted,

provided that agreement is reached with the Branch Assurance Manager. BAST will deal
with these incidents over the telephone.

SECTION 2 — Responsibilities on site of Lead Branch Assurance Advisor
(BAA)

21 The process for undertaking a financial BAV and verification of reported figures is covered
in the Branch Assurance Process - Chapter 2 Performing a Branch Assurance Visit.
Additional activity required at robberies/burglaries are outlined in the R&B work-aid on the
Knowledge Centre — Branch Assurance — Chapter 05 Robbery & Burglary - Branch
Assurance Visit

2.2 Documents for completion can be found in the Knowledge Centre. This includes:
e Report of Stolen Non-Value — multi-purpose sheet for recording details of stolen non-
value or serial numbered stock.

2.3 Due to the unexpected nature of robberies and burglaries, it will be the responsibility of the
lead BAA to look at the Branch Assurance Portal (BAP) to ensure remittance checks are
undertaken.

24 If the incident has been initially noted as
the Security Team must be contacted on}
incident process.

but it later transpires that it is serious,
for them to enable their major

2.5 The discrepancy identified on the RBART (Robbery/Burglary Branch Assurance Reporting
Tool) should equal the figure as declared on HOL (Horizon Online) which has been settled
to the suspense account for the Robbery or Burglary, which in turn must be exactly the
same as the combined totals of the P3263’s (cash, currency and stock). All these figures
must now be recorded on the BART Results/Snapshot page just below the “current trading
position” (the table appears on the RBART when the branch assurance is designated as a
Robbery/ Burglary branch assurance visit). If these figures do not agree, then an
explanation must be shown on the RBART - the reason for this is to help the relevant duties
identify the correct losses associated to the R&B and understand the differences.

2.6 Any prior discrepancies carried by the branch should not be accounted for in the R&B loss
posted to HOL suspense account (e.g. BART discrepancy arrived at figure of £2550,
however branch carrying a £50 discrepancy prior to robbery therefore amount posted to
R&B suspense should only be £2500. If £50 was a surplus, then R&B suspense figure would
be £2600).

27 Explain to the Postmaster that a transaction correction TC, that is without prejudice, will be
raised by the Branch Reconciliation Team, and that they should:
e Accept the transaction correction immediately upon receipt.
e Instructions for processing this TC should be left with the Postmaster.
e Inform the Branch Support Centre if any cash/stock is returned to them as recovered by
either the Police or public.

be retained by Police for investigative purposes, for production at court as evidence, and

SECTION 3 - Recoveries

3.2 Where a return of property is to be made, communication will normally be established
between the Police and Post Office Security via the Branch Support Centre (formerly
NBSC), and details obtained relating to the incident and nature of the property.
