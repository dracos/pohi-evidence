Steve,

Following the Pre-trial review of this matter last Friday 27th April, the court has ordered the case not
to be re-listed before 18th May 2012 to set a trial date and in the meantime we need to serve the
dates to avoid, i would suggest asap.

I understand the following witnesses are needed at present:

i) Bill Constant

ii) Linda Collard
iii) Graham Collard
iv) Mike Wilcox

v) Graham Brander
vi) Yourself

With regard to your statement which is in effect being treated as an expert's report about the Horizon
system, the Judge has directed that you are to liase with Mr Jenner the author of the defence report,
in the usual way between experts, to identify the issues of disagreement between you. this could be
done by telephone, his contact details being! . The purpose
would be to identify prior to the trial what can be agreed and what is disputed about the Horizon
system, narrowing down the issues and making evidence quick adn relevant!

Regards.

Andrew Bolc
