POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF RICHARD CHRISTOU

|, RICHARD CHRISTOU, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION
1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 10 April
2024 (the “Request’), to the extent | have direct knowledge of the matters
addressed in the Request. The Request largely seeks descriptions of the
governance surrounding and oversight of relevant issues by the boards of
both Fujitsu Services Limited and Fujitsu Services Holdings Plc during the

period 2000 to 2012, and my role during this time.

2. | note that | have previously made a witness statement to the Inquiry dated
20 March 2023, which was submitted in response to a Rule 9 Request dated
6 January 2023 (WITN03840100, my “First Witness Statement’). Where
relevant, | make reference to paragraphs of my First Witness Statement in

this statement.

3. As noted in paragraph 1 of my First Witness Statement, | am a former

Page 1 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

employee of International Computers Limited (“ICL”) (later renamed Fujitsu
Services Limited (“FSL”)) and thereafter a former employee of Fujitsu Limited

(“Fujitsu”).

4. | ceased to have any responsibility for operational matters on 30 April 2011,
and thereafter spent a year based in Singapore acting as an adviser to
Fujitsu. | am therefore unable to assist the Inquiry with information on any

matters relevant to the Inquiry for periods after 30 April 2011.

5. The Request deals with events many of which took place over 20 years ago,
so in some cases my recollection is limited. | have therefore refreshed my
memory by reviewing the documents provided to me by the Inquiry. To the
extent those documents have assisted my recollection, | refer to the

documents using the URNs listed in the index accompanying this statement.

6. In preparing this witness statement, | have been assisted by Morrison
Foerster, the recognised legal representatives for Fujitsu Services Limited in
the Inquiry. Morrison Foerster have also, at my request, provided me with
some additional documents, to assist me in making this statement, which |
refer to later in this statement where relevant, again using the URNs listed in

the index accompanying this statement.

CORPORATE STRUCTURE OF ICL PATHWAY _ LIMITED, FUJITSU

SERVICES LIMITED AND FUJITSU SERVICES HOLDINGS PLC BETWEEN
2000 AND 2012

7. As at 1 January 2000, International Computers Limited (“ICL”) was a wholly-

owned subsidiary of ICL plc, the ultimate holding company of the group (the

Page 2 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

“ICL Group”). ICL was the UK company which carried on the ICL Group
operations in the UK and employed the UK employees of the ICL Group. The

board of ICL met for fiscal and legal purposes only.

8. ICL Pathway Limited (“ICLP”) was a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICL.

9. ICL plc also owned operations outside the UK, which were carried out through
operating subsidiaries registered in the relevant jurisdictions. Most were
wholly-owned. All these international holdings were owned by ICL Global
Investments Limited (“IGIL”) which itself was a wholly-owned subsidiary of

ICL ple.

10. On 1 April 2002, the ICL brand was replaced by the Fujitsu brand and, as a
consequence, the names of the above entities were changed as follows

around the same time:

a. ICL plc - Fujitsu Services Holdings Plc (“FSH”)

b. International Computers Limited - Fujitsu Services Limited (“FSL”)

c. ICL Pathway Limited - Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Limited (“Pathway”)

d. ICL Global Investments Limited - Fujitsu Services (Investments)

Limited (“FSIL”)

e. The ICL Group - the FSH Group

11.This was a change only in name. There was no change in the corporate

structure.

12.In particular, with regard to Pathway, its managing director, a Mr Michael

Page 3 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

Stares, continued to report directly to Mr David Courtley, as he had done
since Mr Courtley’s appointment as Chief Operating Officer of ICL in around

July 2001.

13.The change in brand and consequent changes to the composition of the
boards were first discussed at the ICL plc Board Meeting dated 1 August 2001
(see FUJ00003641 and paragraphs 70 and 71 of my First Witness
Statement). They were approved in principle at the ICL plc Board Meeting

dated 7 February 2002, (see FUJ00003644).

14. Following these changes, there was a much closer involvement of Fujitsu in
the activities of the rebranded ICL operations. More Japanese directors were
appointed to the boards of FSH, FSL, and FSIL. More employees of Fujitsu
attended board meetings as observers and were assigned as resident staff

in the FSH operations.

15.In order to make board meetings of all three companies more efficient, it was
decided that their boards should delegate their oversight of those companies
to a management committee: the Fujitsu Services Management Committee
(the “FSMC’”). The board members of the three companies sat on the FSMC.
Thus, the affairs of the FSH Group were dealt with in one meeting on one
day, rather than under three separate board meetings. The minutes of the
first meeting of the FSMC held on 29 May 2002 are contained in

FUJ00003704.

16.So far as | am aware, this structure continued in operation unchanged up to

the date of my retirement.

Page 4 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

17.Following the change in brand and the new governance structure, there was
a major change in the management structure within FSL. Mr Courtley
presented the details of his new structure to the first meeting of the FSMC on
29 May 2002, and the new structure was approved, (see FUJ00003704). It
was then implemented progressively during the remainder of fiscal year

2002/2003.

18.In particular, the five major projects, each with a designated project leader
would report directly to him for the time being. One such project was the

operation of Legacy Horizon by Pathway, (see again FUJ00003704).

19.The extension of the Legacy Horizon contract to 2010 (the “Extension
Contract’) was negotiated in the latter part of 2002, and came into effect on
1 January 2003, (see paragraph 69 of my First Witness Statement). However,
it was decided that the delivery of this contract would be better housed in FSL
itself, in conformity with the new management structure. Therefore, (as set
out in paragraph 71 of my First Witness Statement), with the consent of Post
Office Counters Limited (“POCL”, now Post Office Limited, “POL”), the whole

of the undertaking and operation of Pathway would be transferred to FSL.

20.Although the Extension Contract came into effect on 1 January 2003,
Pathway, POCL and FSL agreed to effect the transfer at the beginning of the
next Fujitsu fiscal year, on or about 1 April 2003. As part of this exercise, the
Extension Contract would be novated to FSL, (see the board minutes of FSH
dated 20 December 2002 and 28 March 2003, at FUJ00003645 and

FUJ00003646 respectively).

21.Once this happened, the Horizon project became one of the five major

Page 5 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

projects within FSL and the director of the Horizon operation continued to

report to Mr Courtley.

22.Thus, in summary, on or around 1 April 2003, FSH had two direct
subsidiaries: FSL and FSIL. Pathway, still a wholly-owned subsidiary of FSL,

was now dormant.

BACKGROUND TO MY APPOINTMENT AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FSH AND
THE NATURE OF THAT ROLE AND ITS RESPONSIBILITIES

23.From my recollection, prior to 1985, ICL plc was a public company quoted on
the London Stock Exchange. It lost its quotation when STC plc purchased the

company in 1985. Around 1988, STC plc decided to sell ICL plc.

24. Although there were a number of interested parties, ICL plc already had close
ties with Fujitsu, which, since 1980, had supplied the central processing units

for the main-frame computers manufactured and sold by ICL plc.

25.Mr Michio Naruto, a senior executive of Fujitsu had long been responsible for
this relationship. As a result, he persuaded Fujitsu to purchase ICL plc in
1989. Initially Fujitsu only purchased 80% of the shares but in 1991 increased

their holding to 100%.

26.1 first got to know Mr Naruto at this time as | was responsible, as Director
Commercial and Legal Affairs of STC plc, for the commercial and legal
aspects of the sale to Fujitsu. As shown in my CV in the Annex of my First
Witness Statement, in around 1990, | left STC plc and moved to the same

position, Director Commercial and Legal Affairs, in ICL plc.

Page 6 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

27.During the decade commencing 1990, ICL pic was run very much as a stand-
alone business, with Fujitsu participating in its management only by way of

the ICL plc board meetings, chaired by Mr Naruto, during this period.

28.1 was not a main board director, but | met with Mr Naruto frequently,
particularly during the latter part of the decade during the renegotiation of the

Legacy Horizon contract.

29.It had always been Mr Naruto's pledge, openly expressed both to Fujitsu and
the ICL Group that ICL plc would be floated again on the London Stock
Exchange, although Fujitsu would continue to hold a majority of the shares.
Originally, he committed to a float in 1995, but when the time came, due to
ICL plc’s lacklustre performance, a float did not appear feasible, and he

revised the projected date to the year 2000.

30.During 1999, the Codified Agreement was signed, and the ICL Group
management were still firmly committed to the idea of floating during the next

year.

31. Unfortunately, the general performance of ICL plc during that year and in the
beginning of the fiscal year 2000 was again not sufficient to make it possible
to float, and Mr Naruto reluctantly ordered all preparations for the float to

cease. He dismissed the possibility of floatation for the foreseeable future.

32. Around this time, Mr Naruto decided that a change in the Chief Executive of
ICL plc was necessary. Although the initial renegotiation of the Legacy
Horizon contract may have been a contributing factor, | believe Mr Naruto's

decision in this regard was largely motivated by the failure to make good his

Page 7 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

pledge of floatation.

33.In July 2000, Mr Naruto asked me to become acting Chief Executive until a
successor could be appointed to the role. | became acting Chief Executive of

ICL plc in August 2000.

34. During my appointment, | decided to act as Chief Executive, rather than as a
placeholder, and in the next six months | did as much as possible to sort out

the current problems in the ICL Group with short-term solutions.

35.The HR Director of Fujitsu, a Mr Okada, carried out a search and, together
with Mr Naruto, interviewed a short list of applicants for the role of Chief
Executive. As is often the case in such circumstances, | also applied for the
position, was put on the short list, and interviewed. | was finally chosen and

became Chief Executive of ICL plc in December 2000.

36.During my time as Chief Executive, | carried out the usual duties of a Chief
Executive responsible for the operations of the FSH Group, reporting to the
board of FSH, but also, on a day-to-day basis, first to Mr Naruto and then to

Mr Hiroaki Kurokawa, his successor.

BACKGROUND TO MY APPOINTMENT AS EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF FSH

AND THE NATURE OF THE ROLE AND ITS RESPONSIBILITIES

37.From the time of my appointment as acting Chief Executive of ICL plc in July
2000 to 1 April 2003, the ICL Group, and then the re-branded FSH Group,
was in a state of considerable change. It was only with the beginning of fiscal
year 2003/2004 that the new organisation settled down. By the end of that
fiscal year, it was felt that the FSH Group, particularly FSL was now able to

Page 8 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

move forward after the reorganisation.

38.On 1 April 2004, Mr Courtley was appointed Chief Executive of FSH, and |
was appointed Chairman of FSH and consequently of the FSMC. Up to this
time Mr Kurokawa (subsequently the President of Fujitsu) had been chairman

of the FSMC.

39.When | became Chairman of FSH, it was decided that my title would be
Executive Chairman. Although this title has no legal standing in English law,
it indicated, so far as Fujitsu was concerned, that unlike the case of many
limited companies, | was a full-time employee of the company in question with
continued line responsibility. Thus, Mr Courtley, as Chief Executive, still

reported to me on a day-to-day basis rather than only to the Board as a whole.

40.1 was also the primary link between Fujitsu and the Group, reporting to Mr
Kurokawa. This was a time-consuming task, with many visits to Japan outside

of the formal board meetings.

41.In addition, | dealt with higher-level customer visits and customer events, and
visited some of the international operations; since Mr Courtley had to spend

most of his time on FSL, as the main profit engine of the FSH Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

42. Just like all of the activities within the ICL Group and the FSH Group (together,
“both Groups”), Legacy Horizon and HNG-X were subject to the various
general oversight regimes established from time to time by the relevant Board
which governed the operations of both Groups. Many of these systems had
their origin in ICL plc during the decade of the 1990s and some from even

Page 9 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

before then.

43.1 set out below a description of such regimes to the best of my recollection,

as they existed during the decade of the 2000s.

44. During the period between January 2000 and April 2011 the relevant boards
which maintained oversight of Horizon were firstly the Board of ICL ple and

then the FSMC, (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above).

45.In addition, | describe some additional oversight put in place specifically for
Legacy Horizon, of which | have personal knowledge. | am not aware whether

any such specific oversight was put in place for HNG-X.

The Groups’ Management Cycle

46. The management cycle within both Groups was driven by Fujitsu’s reporting
obligations as a company listed on the Tokyo and New York Stock

Exchanges.

47. Thus, the fiscal year (“FY”) of both Groups, conformed to the FY of Fujitsu,
commencing on 1 April in each calendar year and terminating on 31 March in
the next calendar year. FYs were denominated by the calendar year in which

they commenced.

48.Each FY, both Groups created a rolling medium-term plan (“MTP”) covering
the next three FYs and a consolidated budget for the next FY. The MTP was
approved during November of each FY and the budget in February, just
before the end of the same FY. This budget was a more detailed version of

the first FY of the MTP which had already been approved.

Page 10 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

49.Each MTP was regarded as a reasonable forecast, but the budget was
considered a firm commitment. Any variation between the first year of an MTP
and the consequent budget was scrutinised very closely. In the case of the
ICL Group, the MTP and the relevant budget were approved by the Board of

ICL plc, and in the case of the FSH Group by the FSMC.

50.In both Groups, the MTP and the budget were created from the bottom up,
not imposed from the top down. So the various operations would create their
own mini MTP and budget, which was then consolidated at group

headquarters, prior to submission to the relevant Board for approval.

5

. This bottom-up approach was very important for surfacing major problems at
Board level. The MTP covered operational and strategic issues as well as
financial ones, and any major operational problems would appear either in
the MTP itself, as variations between an MTP and the MTP approved in the
previous FY, or as a result of a variation between the first FY of an MTP and

the budget for that FY.

Quarterly Business Reviews

52.Overlaid on this cycle was a series of quarterly business reviews (‘QBR’)
carried out to enable Fujitsu to fulfil its obligations as a listed company for

quarterly reporting.

53.In the case of both Groups, the various operational divisions would carry out
separate QBR’s which were consolidated at their group headquarters and
presented to the relevant Board by way of a report from the Chief Executive
(mainly covering operational issues) and a report from the Chief Financial

Officer, covering performance in comparison with the budget for that quarter.

Page 11 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

54. Thus, both Groups held four board meetings in each FY, scheduled for one
month after the end of each financial quarter of the FY: in May, August,
November and February. In addition to approval of the MTP in November and
of the budget in February, each meeting would consider the operational and

financial results for the preceding quarter.

55.For a complete set of meetings comprising this cycle, see the four FSMC

meetings in 2005, namely:

a. 23 February 2005 (FUJ00003583);

b. 18 May 2005 (FUJ00003670);

c. 18 August 2005 (FUJ00003674); and

d. 17 November 2005 (FUJ00003585).

56.Legacy Horizon and later HNG-X were included within this business cycle.

57. Initially, | would lead QBRs, in my capacity as Chief Executive, but once Mr
Courtley became Chief Operating Officer they were his responsibility. After
that, as Chief Executive and then as Executive Chairman, | would consider
and discuss the results of his QBRs with Mr Courtley (including those relating

to Horizon), before finalisation for submission to the relevant board meeting.

Independence of Legal and Commercial Functions.

58.When | was Director Commercial and Legal Affairs for ICL plc during the
1990s, | instituted a system whereby legal and commercial personnel

reported on a line basis to me.

Page 12 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

59. They were placed as advisers to the operations to which they were assigned,
but, in order to guarantee their independence, | carried them on a separate
budget owned by myself and set their salary and bonus structure. They were
tasked to work cooperatively with their divisions but their independence
meant that they would be able to surface any disagreement as to legal or

commercial matters to the next level of authority.

60. In the 1990s, if the disagreement continued without resolution at lower levels,

| would then have to resolve this difference with the Chief Executive.

61.During my time as Chief Executive of FSH, the Legal and Commercial
Directors (not main board members) reported directly to me, even though,
when Mr Courtley was appointed Chief Operating Officer, all the operating

divisions reported to him.

62.1 made it clear that, in appropriate cases, | would resolve any difference
surfaced to me between operational and legal or commercial management

on its merits and not automatically in favour of the operational management.

63.Naturally, when Mr Courtley became Chief Executive, the heads of the
various functions, including the Legal and the Commercial Directors reported

to him.

64. The independence of the commercial and legal functions is a very important
safety valve in case of problems arising further down in the organisation. So
far as | am aware, this separate reporting line, at least for the legal function,

continued up to the date of my retirement at the end of April 2012.

Page 13 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

Delegation of Authority
65.When | became Chief Executive of the ICL Group, | inherited a delegation of

authority from the Board of ICL pic, which governed the matters which | could
approve without taking them to the Board. This system was refined and

continued under the FSMC.

66.Such decisions were classified both by type and by value, and included such
matters as customer contracts and variations thereto, capital investments,

leases, purchase contracts and settlement of legal disputes.

67.1 was empowered to create a chain of sub-delegations for each such matter,
with progressively decreasing values at each level, starting with my direct
reports and extending to other managers at increasingly lower levels in the

relevant organisation.

68.1 do not recollect precise details of the delegation of authority, which did vary
in detail from time to time, except that | recall that | was authorised to sign
customer contracts, and variations thereof, not exceeding £50m in value. All
decisions taken under the delegation of authority were reported at meetings
of the Board of ICL plc or of the FSMC, under a regular agenda item —

‘Documents Signed and Sealed’.

69. The Extension Contract exceeded £50m and therefore was signed after prior
presentation to and approval by the FSMC and Board of FSH. See the FSMC
meetings on 20 August 2002 (FUJ00003534) and 19 November 2002
(FUJ00003589), and the Board meeting of FSH of 20 December 2002

(FUJ00003645).

Page 14 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

70.So far as HNG-X was concerned, it was reported on at two FSMC meetings,
but | do not recollect when and how it was actually approved, (see FSMC
Meetings of 18 May 2005 (FUJ00003670) and 17 November 2005

(FUJ00003585)).

Quality Controls

71.Within both Groups there was a quality assurance operation tasked with
monitoring the quality of services provided to the customer under contracts,

often referred to as the Service Level.

72.Quality control for each service provided was based on a “traffic lights

system”: Red, Amber and Green.

a. A red alert would be raised in the case of serious issues, the most
extreme of which would be an outage — a failure to provide the service

at all due to technical problems;

b. An amber alert would be raised in the case of less serious issues

which nevertheless should be addressed with urgency; and

c. A Classification of green signified that normal service to the agreed

level was being provided.

73.A red alert was always notified to the relevant customer and to the Chief

Executive.

74.Both red and amber alerts required the delivery organisation concerned to
devote extra resources sufficient to cope with the incident; and, in the case

of a red alert, to co-opt staff from other divisions, if necessary.

Page 15 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

Oversight by Fujitsu Personnel

75.In the Fujitsu headquarters in Tokyo there had been established, for some
time before the acquisition of ICL plc by Fujitsu, a group of employees
overseen by senior Fujitsu executives reporting to Mr Naruto who supervised
the operations of many of Fujitsu’s overseas companies (the “Overseas

Office”).

76. Their task was to assemble the operational and financial data from such
companies and present it at the Fujitsu Executive Management Committee,

chaired by the President of Fujitsu.

77.After further discussion and the satisfaction of any queries, the President
would decide how much it was necessary to include in his periodic reports to

the main board of Fujitsu.

78. The Overseas Office was not deeply involved in the affairs of ICL plc during
the 1990s. However, with the much closer involvement of Fujitsu after 2000,
which increased even further once the brand was changed and the FSMC
created, this Overseas Office was increased to about 40 people. The bulk of
the Overseas Office work consisted in the analysis and scrutiny of operational

and financial information from the FSH Group.

79.During my time as Chief Executive, the main link between the Overseas
Office and the FSH Group was the Chief Financial Officer of the FSH Group,
Mr Toshio Adachi. He had a dual reporting line to me and to the Chief
Financial Officer of Fujitsu. He also had one or two people from the Overseas
Office located in his department in London to facilitate the transmission of

information.

Page 16 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

80.Mr Adachi and | worked closely together while | was Chief Executive and
Executive Chairman. When | became Head of Fujitsu EMEA Regional

Operations in April 2007, he returned to Tokyo to head the Overseas Office.

81.1 then acted as the main link between the FSH Group and the Overseas Office
in cooperation with Mr Adachi in Tokyo, and his staff from the Overseas Office

who remained in London.

82.We continued to work together in the same way, as he and | progressed in
the Fujitsu organisation, until his retirement in 2009. When | ceased to have
operational responsibility at the end of April 2011, the Overseas Office and

this oversight regime still applied to the FSH Group.

Parent Company Guarantees

83.As was then becoming common with large UK Government contracts, Fujitsu
had provided a performance guarantee for the Codified Agreement entered
into between POCL (as it then was) and Pathway on 28 July 1999. It also
provided a guarantee for the Extension Contract. In 2006, Fujitsu agreed to
extend the then existing guarantee to cover the contract relating to HNG-X,

(see paragraph 74 of my First Witness Statement).

84. These guarantees required the approval of the main Board of Fujitsu and
there were in each case a series of special presentations on the contract in
question to Fujitsu in Tokyo by the relevant operation in the FSH Group,
culminating in presentation for approval of the grant of the guarantee at a
Fujitsu main board meeting. The preparatory work for these presentations
was largely carried out by the Overseas Office, in cooperation with relevant

personnel from the FSH Group.

Page 17 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

85. Thus, Fujitsu exercised another level of control on the content and signature
of contracts where a Fujitsu guarantee was required. This resulted in an
additional level of contract assurance, and an increased focus from Fujitsu

on the performance of the contract in question.

86. When Mr Courtley became Chief Operating Officer of ICL in July 2001, he
was also assigned a Japanese assistant (initially Mr Hiromichi Hirata, and
later Mr Takata Yamada) who acted as a link between Mr Courtley and the
operational divisions in Japan. At that time, Mr Courtley would head up the
presentations for parent company guarantees in Tokyo with the assistance of

Mr Hirata and later of Mr Yamada.

87. Such guarantees became a normal requirement for large contracts. In the
documents to which | have been referred there are many references to the
need for such guarantees in respect of various contracts, (see for instance

the discussion in the FSMC Meeting on 26 August 2004 at FUJ00003577).

Specific Oversight for Legacy Horizon

88. During the development of Legacy Horizon under the Related Agreements
and the Codified Agreement, a large group of Japanese Software Engineers
were brought over from Japan to London to assist in and monitor the delivery

of the project.

89. They reported regularly to their division in Tokyo. Their involvement largely
ended with final acceptance in around 1999 but some remained in the UK

during roll out until its end in 2002.

OVERSIGHT OF CERTAIN MATTERS RELATING TO THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM
90. Inthe preceding section, | have described how the board of ICL plc and later
the FSMC maintained oversight of the operations of the ICL Group and the

FSH Group respectively, including Legacy Horizon and HNG-X. | also

described some further independent oversight exercised by Fujitsu.

91. In this section, | address the Inquiry’s questions surrounding how the boards
of FSL and FSH maintained oversight of a number of specific matters relevant

to the Horizon IT System. Each of these matters is addressed in tum below:

(i) The ‘integrity’ of the Horizon IT System

92. By the word “integrity” in this context, | understand two main points arise:

a. First: Did the Horizon IT System perform in accordance with the

requirements of the relevant contract?

b. Second: What security systems existed to protect the Horizon IT

System during its operation?

93. So far as the first question is concerned, | know that in the case of Legacy
Horizon this was the case since it passed the final acceptance tests specified
in the Codified Agreement, (see paragraphs 54 to 59 of My First Witness

Statement).

94. So far as the Extension Contract provided for any changes to Legacy Horizon
(as opposed to simply extending the contract term contained in the Codified
Agreement), | do not recall that any adverse reports concerning the relevant

final acceptance tests for such changes were made to the FSMC.

Page 19 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

95. | have no knowledge of the procedure or status of final acceptance for HNG-

x.

96. So far as the second question is concerned, there were security systems in
place for all of the operations of both Groups, as the main source of revenue
in the UK was service contracts under which large quantities of customer data
were being managed. These systems would include measures to prevent
malware attacks, tampering by unauthorised personnel, regular back-ups,
physical security of the data centres where the software was hosted, and

internal audit.

97. Once the relevant development and roll out had been completed and final
acceptance had been achieved, Legacy Horizon and HNG-X were subject to
these systems just like all the other major service contracts. Any serious
breach of these security systems would have been surfaced to the relevant

board under the oversight provisions described in the preceding section.

(ii) The quality of technical support services relevant to the Horizon IT System that

were provided by FSL to POL

98. The system of quality control described above would monitor this issue, with

serious issues surfaced to the relevant board.

99. Indeed, in respect of Horizon, a red alert was reported to the FSMC meetings
on 18 March 2004 (FUJ00003590) and 9 June 2004 (FUJ00003575), (see
also paragraph 72 of my First Witness Statement). An amber alert for Horizon

was reported at the FSMC at the meeting on 26 August 2004 (FUJ00003577).

100. Other reports on service levels were made at board level where necessary,

(see for instance the minutes of the FSMC meeting of 18 August 2005 at

FUJ00003674).

(iii) The prosecution and litigation support services provided by Fujitsu Services

Limited to POL, RUG or RMH

101. As already stated in my First Witness Statement, | had no knowledge of this
issue, and | do not recall it being raised at any board meeting when | was

present, (see paragraphs 75 onwards).

102. | would now, however, like to comment more specifically on this point, in the
light of further documents not known to me at the relevant time, which have
since been provided to me by Morrison Foerster (at my request) for the

purposes of completing this statement.

103. My understanding is that the requirement in the Codified Agreement, and later
in the HNG-X contracts agreed during my tenure, was only to provide data for
the purposes of litigation support. For the relevant provisions, see paragraph
4.1.6 of Schedule A02 of the Codified Agreement and paragraph 4.1.6 of
Schedule A4 of the HNG-X Agreement dated 31 August 2006, by way of

example.

104. The contractual requirement to provide witnesses of fact by way of litigation
support seems to appear initially, so far as | am aware, in a contract controlled
document (or CCD) provided to me by Morrison Foerster entitled ‘Service
Description for the Security Management Service’ (see paragraph 3.10.8 of
FUJ00001743), as opposed to in the Codified Agreement, the Extension

Contract or the HNG-X Agreement themselves. This was first issued for

Page 21 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

approval on 6 January 2003. There is no requirement in the document for it

to be approved at board level

105. Paragraph 3.7 of this document sets out a security incident reporting and
problem management procedure, which the personnel entrusted with the
provision of the relevant services were required to observe in order to inform

the customer, and higher layers of management in FSL.

106. Such issues, if sufficiently serious, would have been notified through
successive levels of management to the Chief Executive and, thereafter, to

the FSMC. | received no such notification while | was Chief Executive.

107. Various iterations of Security Management Service Description appear to
have been issued as Horizon progressed, and the regime continued in

existence beyond my tenure.

108. In this connection, see the Security Management Service Description dated
15 October 2010 (FUJ00088683), which | understand is the last of these
service descriptions to be agreed during my tenure. This Security
Management Service Description also covers litigation support at paragraph
2.1.13, including provision of witnesses, and contains a similar reporting

obligation to paragraph 3.7 of the original document at paragraph 2.1.9.

109.1 have no recollection of seeing these Security Management Service
Descriptions nor of being made aware of their content until the preparation of

this witness statement.

The oversight of the above matters by the companies’ senior management

110. This was carried out by routine management reviews at various levels in the
relevant division, and, more formally, by the system of divisional QBRs. The
quality control and security systems mentioned in sections (i), (ii) and (iii)

above would also be relevant in this respect.

111. | would stress that regular formal meetings are not sufficient. Management
contact on a day-to-day basis is vital, preferably where possible face-to-face.
This was the system | adopted when | was Chief Executive, and which |
encouraged all my direct reports to emulate. Mr Courtley was also very much

a hands-on manager.

DISCUSSIONS WITH THE BOARD AND / SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF FSL OR
FSH

112. | discussed issues relating to Horizon with other members of the board first
of ICL plc and later of the FSMC whenever Horizon was either a specific
agenda item or it was included in a general agenda item (for instance a

quarterly financial report).

113. In the documents provided to me for the purposes of compiling this statement,
operational mentions of Horizon or the Post Office appear in ICL plc board

and FSMC minutes in the following documents:

a. ICL plc board minutes for meeting on 31 October 2001

(FUJ00003642);

b. FSMC minutes for meeting on 29 May 2002 (FUJ00003704);

c. FSMC minutes for meeting on 20 August 2002 (FUJ00003534);

Page 23 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

d. FSMC minutes for meeting on 26 August 2004 (FUJ00003577);

e. FSMC minutes for meeting on 19 November 2002 (FUJ00003589);

f. FSMC minutes for meeting on 5 February 2004 (FUJ00003663);

g. FSMC minutes for meeting on 18 May 2005 (FUJ00003670); and

h. FSMC minutes for meeting on 18 August 2005 (FUJ00003674).

114. Such mentions in financial reports then appear in the following documents:

a. Resolutions and correspondence regarding a capital injection in June

1999 (FUJ00003633);

b. FSMC minutes for meeting on 23 February 2005 (FUJ00003583); and

c. FSMC minutes for meeting on 17 November 2005 (FUJ00003585).

115. | would also have a regular weekly meeting with all my direct reports in the
UK, including Mr Courtley when he became Chief Operating Officer in July
2001. Most of my direct reports were based with me at the headquarters
office. In other cases, | would also hold meetings at the location where the
relevant director was based. Again, where relevant, Horizon would be a

subject of discussion.

116. In relation to Legacy Horizon, | held personal discussions with the senior
management of Pathway and attended board and management meetings
with them, at their premises in Feltham, in the early days of Legacy Horizon
and during the final acceptance tests, (see for instance the minutes for the

Pathway board meeting of 15 August 2000 at FUJ00003693).

WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

117. During roll out these meetings continued, but with less frequency, until in July
2001, Mr Stares (then Managing Director of Pathway) reported to Mr Courtley

when the latter was appointed Chief Operations Officer of FSH.

118. While | was Chief Executive of FSH | was in day-to-day contact with Mr
Courtley, discussing, as necessary, all issues arising from his operations

including where relevant Horizon.

119. Naturally, when | was Executive Chairman, only Mr Courtley reported to me,

but we continued to discuss major issues in the same way.

120. In FY 2007, | became employed directly by Fujitsu as Head of Fujitsu EMEA
Regional Operations. Out of necessity, my contact with Mr Courtley was less
constant. My contact in respect of Horizon from then on, until | ceased to be
responsible for operations in April 2011, was largely through FSMC Meetings

and presentations in Tokyo.

GENERAL COMMENTS
121. In this witness statement, | have set out my views on the adequacy of the
oversight of the issues listed in the Inquiry’s Request by the boards of FSL or

FSH.

122. By way of summary, the oversight of operations within the ICL Group was

carried on at the level of ICL plc and in the FSH Group at the FSMC.

123. | would also emphasise the important role of the additional direct supervision
from Fujitsu which provided a further insight for the Japanese directors on the
board of ICL plc and thereafter on the FSMC. This route became particularly
important from 2007 onwards where the membership of the FSMC included

Page 25 of 28
WITNO3840200
WITN03840200

more Fujitsu directors and an increased number of Fujitsu observers at FSMC
meetings, (see for example the attendance at the meeting of the FSMC of
14th February 2007 recorded in FUJO0003695 where there were 10 Fujitsu

observers and 3 Fujitsu Board members).

124. In my opinion, the systems | have described were sufficiently comprehensive,
with appropriate checks and balances, for the exercise of proper oversight

over both Groups, by the ICL pic board and the FSMC respectively.
