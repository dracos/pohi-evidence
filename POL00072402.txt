JMS1 attending OUT on Mandy Talbot and discussing matters. JMS1 wanted to know whether
there was any evidence at all of the monies that were alleged by Royal Mail to be
outstanding? MT indicating that she had gone through the file but was certainly not able to
find any manual documents to confirm this. JMS1 talking through a few of the issues in the
Reply and Defence to Counterclaim and saying he had slightly amended that from the
version that had been sent through earlier. JMS1 would send that through via HR1‘s email
address. MT talking about getting tired with this case. She was still not sure why the firm
had been given instructions to issue. She will revert soonest.
