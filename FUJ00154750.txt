See you in Court then, Fetters Lane is where they used to hang people out to dry. | dont suppose that type of thing happens any
more though.

That Castleton is a nasty chap and will be all out to rubbish the FJ name, its up to you to maintain absolute strength and integrity
no matter what the prosecution throw at you, WE will all be behind you hoping you come through unscathed. Bless You
