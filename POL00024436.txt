All

Please find attached an urgent decision paper on which I should be grateful for your comments. We need a decision by
142noon on Monday (so that we can action this before Freeths are able to submit their own proposal on this subject).

I hope the attached is self-explanatory but if you have any questions, please do feel free to call or email me.

Kind regards
Andy
