Hiall

I wanted to let you know about the latest developments with Sparrow.

We have today been approached by a BBC North reporter who has clearly seen a copy of the Second Sight
"thematic" Report and Post Office's subsequent letter to applicants (which makes clear our view that the report
is inaccurate.

BBC North plan to run a story on Monday about the Report. We have a short but firm line on which we will
hold. This will state that leak is highly regrettable and not in interests of applicants, and confirm our position is
that the report is inaccurate.

We will not comment further and it is essential we hold on that position to avoid giving the story unnecessary
oxygen. We will work hard to keep a lid on it, though clearly other outlets, including those who have
previously reported on the issue, may follow up on anything run by BBC North.

We are informing the Working Group as a matter of courtesy and making it clear that Post Office will not be
drawn into commenting on matters which are confidential to the Scheme.

I will monitor the situation closely and update you if the position changes.
Best wishes,

Mark
