Hi both

I have gone through M029 and M039 and made some suggested changes based on the drafting of the CRR responses
yesterday. Please see attached, with track changes where I have made amends. (Belinda, I am printing hard copies for
you now).

The response to M039 is due by COP today and although M029 is not due until next week (COP Friday 12 September)
as both Alva and Belinda are off next week it would be good to get this cleared today.

Best wishes
Jess
