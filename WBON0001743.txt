Thanks Tom

I think this is workable for now. Do we have a view on timing for feedback from Lord Neuberger?

Kind regards,

Jane

Tom,

I’ve spoken with Mark and he would in principle be happy to assist going forward.

Mark has several smaller hearings in the run up to a 6-7 week arbitration commencing the last week of May
so he has good availability over the coming months to advise and draft as required.

As things stand, Mark would then be looking from January 2020 to accommodate a hearing in the Court of
Appeal.

I hope that this assists and look forward to hearing from you in due course.

All the best,

Luke
