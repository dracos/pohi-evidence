SUBJECT: Contrantual Position with ICh Pathway

1.

As you know, we have heen seeking to protect the legal
interests of sponsors throughout the re- lanmning period
with ICL Pathway. As you may be aware, CL Pathway have
failed to complate the Operational trial by the contracted
date of 21 November 1997.

In anticipation of this breach I have had discussions with
the Programme lawyezs and agreed the way forward with
George MoCorkell and Paul Rich. In a nutsheli the agreed
couxsea of action is te write to ICL Pathway, informing then
of this breach, at the earliest opportunity.

a are therefore issuing a letter informing them of this
preach of contract but reserving our position on rights and
remedies resulting from thie breach. It is our intention,
of course, to continue discussions on re-planning the way
forward. ‘Rowaver, should we wish to use the breach at any
point in the future, including to terminate the ¢ontract,
fot to have issued the notification now woujd be deemed as
a Waiver of our rights and remedies.

attached is a copy of the letter sent to John Bennett
oday.
