Mandy,

We spoke yesterday about next steps with the additional evidence that Keith and I sent to your office. You said you would
speak to Susanne and she would/might call me back. I have not received a call as of 09:40 this moming.

I tried to contact you this morning but you are out of the office.

I would like confirmation that the additional evidence that I presented is acceptable/useful to the case and sight, of any
proposed Witness Statement that I might have to support in Court.

A call from Susanne or yourself would be appreciated.

Regards,

Jan Holmes
