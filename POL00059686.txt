After a number of meetings between Post Office Managernent and Members of Parliament in
relation to the Court cases, it was agreed that the Post Office would undertake an external
review of the cases which had been raised by the Member's constituents. As the Post Office
continues to have absolute confidence in the robustness and integrity of its Horizon system
and it branch accounting processes, it had no hesitation in agreeing to an external review of
these few individual cases.

In order to provide assurance to the interested parties, it was proposed that the review be
undertaken by independent Auditors 2° Sight. The review will be specifically restricted to the
cases raised by the MPs as well as reviewing the accounting procedures, processes and
reconciliations undertaken in relation to the cases in question. Before formal instructions are
given to the Independent Auditors, agreements will be sought from all interested parties,
namely the Members of Parliament and Justice for Sub postmasters. The Sub postmasters
requested a Forensic Accountant of their choice be appointed to oversee the Cases being
reviewed by 2" Sight and the results are expected in August 2013.

All the above is accepted based on the terms of the Review being carried out, but this is in no

Continuation Statement of Stephen BRADSHAW

way an acknowledgement by the Post Office that there is an issue with Horizon. Over the
past ten years many millions of branch reconciliations have been carried out with
transactions and balances accurately recorded by more than 25,000 different sub
postmasters and the Horizon system continues to work properly in Post Offices across the
length and breadth of the UK. When the system has been challenged in criminal courts it has

been successfully defended.
