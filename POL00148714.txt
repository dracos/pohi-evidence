1Let us not lose sight of the fact Cartwright King are specialist criminal Lawyers .They are in far better position to
advice POL with regards to expert instructions. They are acting in the best interest of their clients i.e. POL and the way
in which the report is being commissioned preserves the independence and integrity of the experts.

2.It is intended to instruct the expert to prepare the report in accordance with the scope but with the proviso that
they immediately notify Cartwright King of anything which may cause POL concern. It will enable the process to be
terminated without full costs being incurred.

3.Experts have prepared a scope ,detailing the work they need to carry out in order to prepare a report ,which will be
fit for purpose.

4.If POL have information which might assist the expert then of course it can be provided. With Deloitte report this
can simply be provided to the expert for consideration.

5.POL need to be careful not to be seen to be interfering with the expert report process. Of course it goes without
POL00148714
POL00148714

saying that POL need to avoid being manipulated by fujitsu i.e. they are the very company whose product expert are
going to review.

6.If there are any concerns with the terminology or phraseology of the scope .Please let me have those and I will feed
them back to Cartwright King for consideration.

7.Fujitsu should appoint a designated person as previously advice, so that ICL may liaise directly with fujitsu where
appropriate.

8. Let us not lose sight of the fact it is in POL wider interest to get the report (and Fujitsu) which gives the Horizon
clean bill of health.

9. The cost provided by the expert who would no doubt considered the material provided by Andy Holt and POL.

I hope this assists.

- As discussed before there is overlap with the Deloitte work. Rod can we share the Deloitte report with
Imperial College. I would also suggest we have a meeting with Julie and you to look at overlap with the
requests from Imperial College.

- I want to make sure we are really clear on scope, having read the document I think this is growing again. In
previous meetings we had agreement that the following scope would help us progress. i.e. our aim was to get
assurance that the transaction data we used in prosecutions was a true reflection of what had happened in
branch. I suggest we review the requirement again with consideration of the Deloitte work and therefore
decide what we really need it to achieve. Martin, I will pick this up with you and Jarnail.

- I have concerns about ICL’s estimate, although it looks very reasonable I am not sure they have understood
the scale of this.

I agree with Martin. POL cannot be seen to be Cheery picking the information provided to the experts or withholding
the information. Experts are independent and POL (or Fujitsu for that matter) cannot be seen to be trying to influence
the experts.

Andy,

I would not advise that the experts be instructed to look at the old Horizon system. If the experts
were to consider the old system, depending on their findings, disclosure issues could arise in
historic cases. In any event cases now being investigated and considered for prosecution will
involve Horizon on Line, which was rolled out during 2010.
POL00148714
POL00148714

In criminal law instructions and material provided to an expert must be listed in his/her report.
The defence are entitled to know what material the expert has considered in order to reach his/her
conclusion.

CK would not wish to vet information prior to sending it to ICL; it would be counter-productive
to withhold information. The experts may well refer to such attempts and missing information in

the report. This would devalue the report and make it easier for defendants to challenge.

I will explore with ICL the “fitness for purpose” heading. If there are any other points, please let
me know and I will raise them at the same time.

Kind regards,

Martin.

My thoughts...

A key question appears to be whether ICL look at old Horizon as well as Horizon Online. My guess is that POL won't
be now looking to prosecute any old Horizon cases so we can focus on HOL. Martin / Jarnail?

As to access to the SS material, I can't see in principle any issue with this. Material going to SS has been largely
vetted already. However, Martin / Jarnail — could you confirm whether an expert under criminal law has to disclose all
material instructions / source material in their report? In the civil process, the general rule is that the expert must
disclose to the Court and the other side pretty much everything they have considered in forming their opinion. If this
applies equally to criminal procedure, then CK / POL may wish to vet any material before sending it to ICL.

We may want to explore what ICL intend to investigate under the "fitness for purpose" heading. This could be as
simple as "does Horizon provide the necessary functionality?". Or, it could go wider into "Does Horizon provide a
good user experience?". From handling IT disputes in the past, I know that determining the quality of user experience
can be a very subjective question, that is difficult to answer.

Finally, I think the structure proposed by ICL really highlights the deficiencies in SS' approach.

Kind regards

Thanks.

It is perhaps inevitable Imperial college London’s experts would wish to speak to Fujitsu directly . Please let me have
the name and contact of the person who will be designated by Fujitsu to speak to the experts.

I am keen to avoid further delay. The proposed report represents good value for money and would be extremely
useful for POL purposes. Sooner we can demonstrate the system works the better.

Belinda/Andy, some of the requests relate to the Second Sights study (which would include MP cases, spot reviews
etc). Are we ok to share this information?

Jarnail, I will share this document with both Fujitsu and within IT so that we assess what ICL are requesting.

Dear All

Please find attached the initial review prepared by professor Kramer and Dr Dulay of London imperial college
consultants.

The initial review contains a proposal which is through and outlines the steps the steps to be taken and
documentation to be considered. There is a proposed work plan on page 4. As you will see it is estimated that it will
take 50 hours consultant days by Professor Kramer and Dr Dulay to complete the work.

Before we proceed with the next step, may I ascertain whether there is any views or observations or questions on
the attached documents.

regards
