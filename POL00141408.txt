Subject: CASE NO 22191 - Prosecution of J Dixon

Attachments: jamiedixondefencestatement.doc01005820120730083855.pdf.pdf

Jarnail,

Please find attached a copy of the Defence Case Statement in the case of Jamie Dixon. As you will see
he has said that, "he does not have confidence in the Horizon accounting system, or that transactions
were accurately recorded. He puts the prosecution to prove that the money is missing.”

This is therefore another case in which there will be a challenge to Horizon. I propose to talk to the
barrister whom we have instructed and explain that a robust stance should be taken at the PCMH on
3rd August 2012 ie The Horizon system works perfectly and that if the Defence wish to challenge the
integrity of it, their specific allegations should be particularised so that those particular issues may be
further considered.

Kind regards,

Martin.

Martin Smith
