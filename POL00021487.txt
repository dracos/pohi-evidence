suggestion may have been made by a DTI Minister that Mr

(ii) a non-executive director would need to be
independent of the day to day executive affairs of
the Company, and Colin Baker would not be able
to satisfy this requirement;

nominate and authorise the appointment of a
director, including the involvement of the Royal

expressed an interest in voluntary redundancy;

18 large loss making branches were under scrutiny to improve
their Profit & Loss by utilising better staff/workload scheduling
and changes to operational processes within the branch;

trials were being considered at a small number of pilot sites with
a view to developing an “enterprise approach”. The aim would
be to inject‘a feeling of “local ownership” into Directly Managed
Branches;

a series of property initiatives were taking place including 10 re-
sites, compulsory purchase orders and merger solutions;

Franchise discussions have commenced with Tesco,
Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer, Budgens, Somerfield, WH
Smith, Woolworths and Wilkinsons. Contact had also been
made with existing multiple partners, including Co-Op and TM
Retail;

two meetings had been diarised with the CWU before the end
of February with the aim of putting forward a formal pay offer.
This would include the implementation of a sales-focused
incentive scheme;

The Board agreed that Dave Miller (Christopher Jonas) would
examine the possibility of extending the opening hours of
branches by refurbishing them in such a way as to allow part of
the branch to remain open outside normal hours. The possibility
of phasing in franchising over a period of time would also be «
explored.

(d)

David Miller introduced Sue Huggins and Mike Granville to the
Board who circulated a presentation on Rural Strategy. The
Board noted that:

The Rural Strategy Programme had been set up to resolve the
post-2008 rural network and financing issues. The strategy had
been approved by the Post Office Ltd Board last year, and a
report would be required by Government that outlined the
available options by December 2005;

The intention would be for Post Office Ltd to develop a ‘flexible
framework’ for future rural service delivery comprising revenue
growth, infrastructure cost reduction and development of
customer access based on ‘core and outreach’;

Post Office Ltd would need to establish from Government the
level of rural provision required for policy reasons over and
above what could be provided commercially. A value for money
solution could then be developed to meet Government needs _

Current activity involved testing the strategy, producing a
financial model, and preparing the ground with stakeholders. A
high level report detailing the options would be required for
Ministers by June 2005.

The Board agreed that:

(i) all meetings and conversations with Government
regarding Rural Strategy would be recorded, and
Government would be provided with copies of
these records;

(ii) pilot activity would commence in uncontentious
areas to avoid results being skewed by the
heightened political sensitivities in the run up to a
general election;

(iii) a letter would be sent to Government explaining
that a reduced pilot scheme would be implemented
so as not to be politically controversial. However,
this could effect the quality information required by
the DTI in June 2005.

Ric Francis circulated a presentation which outlined the strategy

meeting. The Board noted that:

the current contract with Fujitsu was scheduled to. terminate in?
2010, and the replacement of existing Horizon could extend the
contract to. 2016;

a 30% reduction in IT costs would be required by 2008. This
would be a.key enabler for Post Office Ltd to meet its Rural and
Directly Managed saving targets;

Authority was provided in 2004 to complete the requirements
phase. Gartner have evaluated and reported and benchmarked
Fujitsu’s priced proposal;

Alan Cook commented that in practical terms contracts of this
scope.and length would require renegotiation every 2-3 years
because the business models changed so rapidly.

Assurance was provided to the Board that the new system
would have at least a similar standard of current capability.

The Board agreed that:
(i) the ‘proceed with caution’ approach should be

followed to help put pressure on Fujitsu in
negotiations;

(a) Peter Corbett circulated the latest cashflow figures and
schedule. The Business Plan presented to the Royal Mail
Holdings Board in December showed that Post Office Ltd would
become insolvent again unless balance sheet refinancing was
put into place. A solution with Royal Mail Group and the DTI
would be pursued along the following lines.

(i) agreement of a shared vision that Post Office Ltd
would become a profitable entity, earning a
commercial rate of return on.invested capital —
aspirational target circa £150m p.a.;

(ii) I agreement to pursue together a refinancing and
capitalisation of the business in accordance with
the vision above;

(iii) short to medium term cash outflows will be
covered by making available the “mails reserve” on
the Group balance sheet to POL, and by Group
paying POL for utilisation of its tax losses;

(b) The mechanics to ensure (i) — (iii) took place were
under development;

The solution assumed that RMG would have sufficient profits to
utilise Post Office Ltd’s tax losses and pay for them as per the
circulated schedule;

RMG would need to confirm that the Mails reserve would be
made available to Post Office Ltd and DTI consent would be
required;

The cashflow figures assumed State Aids clearance would be
obtained. As this clearance would not have been obtained
before the accounts were signed at financial year end, Post
Office. Ltd would need comfort that the mails reserve from
which these monies are funded would also be available for this
purpose in the event that State Aid clearance was refused;

Final confirmation regarding the position would be available at
the April Board meeting before the accounts had been finalised.

CASH CYCLE PAPER POLB(05)10

(c)

(4)

Peter Corbett presented the Cash Cycle paper to the Board.
The paper provided an update on the impact of the cash
benefits payment migrating to bank transfers. The Board noted
that:-

for a number of years the branches had a net deficit of £20b in
cash. The major customer business which had driven this had
been encashment of benefits net of small business cash
deposits in Alliance & Leicester (Girobank) accounts.

as a result, of the changes to benefits payments, the profile had
changed from a deficit of £16.8b in 2004/05 to a surplus of
£7.9b in 2005/06. This surplus would be removed from the
balance sheet by selling it to other Banks. This is expected to
provide a resolution to the cash surplus issue for the
foreseeable future but will continue to be closely monitored.

An alternative strategy if required, would be to reduce the level
of the cash deposits business. This would require a
corresponding reduction in fixed overheads. Ric Francis would
review what level of fixed overheads could be eliminated if the
cash deposits business was reduced.
