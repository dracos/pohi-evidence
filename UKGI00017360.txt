Hi Gill

I agreed with Alice that I would stay on the pension committee next year but come off the ARC now so I effectively
1am standing down from ARC at the year end.

Hope that's ok.

Thanks

Susannah

PS, Alwen, it probably makes sense now to transfer all POL e-mail correspondence that comes to me to my work
address which is susannah.storey? can you do the logistics on this or do you want me to e-mail all
the NEDS/Alice etc?

Susannah,

I note from the March board minutes that you are standing down from the ARC committee.

ls it your intention to continue on the Pensions Committee or are you intending to step down from that as
well?

Thanks

Gill
