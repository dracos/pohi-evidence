Tony instructed on 3, with Jane’s rider:

Agree on 3, but we need to handle it carefully so as not to be perceived by Worden as criticising him, nor

giving Fraser an excuse to ‘find’ against Worden! A careful balancing act is required by Tony!!!

Rod,

I'm on a busy train to London at the minute, so please forgive the email as opposed to a call.

Tony needs instructions on whether or not to ask for permission for Worden 3. The options are:-

to seek permission for supplemental reports from both sides;

to ask the court not to give permission; or

to explain the situation we find ourselves in and invite the court to form its own view on what to do next.

Our instinct is to go for option 3. Please would you let me have your thoughts.

Kind regards

Jonny
