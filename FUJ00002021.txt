1.6.

The Engineering Service comprises an on-site replacement or repair service, together
with associated backup, support and administrative functions, for Counter Equipment
at Branches and other designated Post Office locations, including Counter Training
Offices (CTOs), Head Office Counter Positions. Where possible the Service Desk
Service will provide resolution of Hardware faults, however any Hardware faults
which cannot be resolved will be passed to the Engineering Service to initiate
deployment of a Fujitsu Services Support Engineer.

On-site replacement or repair for the PostShop Branch Infrastructure is defined
within the Contract Controlled Document (CCD) entitled: “Service Integration
Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0010).

The Engineering Service shall comprise the following elements:
(a) on-site replacement of faulty Counter Equipment;

(b) _ repair and recycling of faulty Counter Equipment;

(c) limited Hardware asset tracking — base units only;

(d) Local Area Network (LAN) support;

(ec) Portable Appliance Testing (PAT); and

(f) Service Management.

Fujitsu Services Support Engineers will be appropriately trained and the Engineering
Service shall include the use of Technical Couriers where Fujitsu Services considers it
is appropriate for such Technical Couriers to carry out the Engineering Service.

Maintenance and repair of the Counter Equipment involving on-site attendance at
Post Office premises by Fujitsu Services Support Engineers shall not interfere unduly
with the ability of a Branch to serve Customers, even where the Branch has only a
single Counter Position and/or extremely limited physical space.

Fujitsu Services shall carry out visits for maintenance or repair in accordance with the
SLTs described within section 2.3.5 of this Engineering Service, Service Description.
However, the Branch Manager may clect to defer a visit to a more convenient time.
For example, in a larger Branch, if a fault occurs at the busiest time of day then the
Branch Manager may specify the start time from which Fujitsu Services may carry
out the maintenance or repair. In such circumstances, the request for service shall be
diagnosed fully but not carried out until the Branch Manager's preferred appointment
time. In this case the time in suspension shall not count towards downtime as defined
within section 2.3.5 of this Engineering Service, Service Description.

PIN Pad requires repair to Fujitsu Services by telephone to the Service Desk.
Following receipt of such a call from Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall ensure that
there is a properly functioning PIN Pad at the PIN Pad Site.

Repair and recycling of faulty equipment

Where faulty Counter Equipment is replaced as part of the Engineering Service,
Fujitsu Services will, where economically viable, ensure that it is repaired and
rendered fit for re-use in the Branch Infrastructure.

Fujitsu Services reserves the right to inform Post Office that a particular item of
Counter Equipment is determined to be beyond economic repair and, in such
circumstances, Fujitsu Services shall not repair that particular item of Counter
Equipment within the spares loop or return it for re-use in the Branch Infrastructure.

Each item of Counter Equipment returned for repair will be examined, and the fault
determined. The fault will be repaired and the Counter Equipment will be cleaned
and tested, including a check for electrical safety.

Where base units have been replaced, Fujitsu Services will clean those base units of
all data and apply a new software build which consists of a single basic image which
is updated automatically when the unit is reinstalled.

Fujitsu Services may, at its discretion, use a third party to complete the repair works,
which may include, but is not limited to, the Counter Equipment manufacturer.

Fujitsu Services may cannibalise returned units to extend the life of the spares
provision.

Hardware asset tracking

Fujitsu Services will ensure that all base units residing in Branches, Head Office
Counter Positions and Counter Training Officers will be recorded, by serial number,
as whole units (a PC base unit is classed as one whole unit even though different
components may be utilised for spares).

Fujitsu Services will record all serialised base unit assets and the exchange of serial
numbers as a result of service visits.

Fujitsu Services will record the serial number of any piece of Counter Equipment at
the point of repair to enable monitoring of the returns for multiple failures on a single
piece of Counter Equipment so as to identify rogue units to be removed from the
spares loop.

Notwithstanding sections 2.1.3.2 and 2.1.3.3. of this Engineering Service,
Service Description, Fujitsu Services will exercise control over all Counter
Equipment including component parts held by them on behalf of Post Office, at a
level appropriate for the ongoing provision of the service.

Transaction Recovery

For all Branches not yet migrated to the HNG-X Application, transaction recovery
will take place to meet the data delivery SLTs defined in the CCD entitled: “Data
Centre Operations Service: Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0003).

When the ADSL or ISDN line is not available at a Branch, a Fujitsu Services Support
Engineer (or other suitably qualified person authorised by Fujitsu Services) will visit
that Branch (a “Recovery Visit”) and connect the working Gateway PC with the Data
Centre via an ADSL / ISDN emulator, a Fujitsu Services Support Engineer's laptop
(configured to communicate with the Data Centre via PSTN) and the Branch’s
existing PSTN line.

Connection with the Data Centre will be achieved using the ADSL / ISDN emulator
in such a way that the Gateway PC communicates with the Data Centre as if it was
using an ADSL or ISDN line. Such connection shall be achieved using a free phone
telephone number.

The connection between a Branch and the Data Centre using the ADSL / ISDN
emulator and its subsequent disconnection after successful transmission of messages
to and from the Data Centre shall be carried out such that if the ADSL / ISDN line is
restored before Fujitsu Services arranges another Recovery Visit to that Branch,
normal service to that Branch using the ADSL or ISDN line will resume.

Connection between a Branch and the Data Centre via the ADSL / ISDN emulator,
laptop and PSTN line will only be applied if that Branch has a PSTN line and a
standard telephone socket that the Fujitsu Services Support Engineer is allowed
access to.

The detailed procedures for arranging and executing Recovery Visits are described in
the Working Document entitled “Process for Laptop Data Retrieval”
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0002).
