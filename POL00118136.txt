Triggers & Timescales
This document details triggers and timescale processes and in particular those relating to Immediate Open & Major Enquiry status.
Immediate notice Open Enquiry cases must be dealt with as follows:
Immediate Open Where interviews within 48 hours are appropriate and Able to progress almost immediately
Enquiry few pre-interview enquiries are needed Case to be at “suspect offender” interviewed within 48
hours where practically possible.

Major Enquiry cases must be dealt with as follows:
Major Enquiry >£15,000 (or major customer / client / reputation Case to be at “suspect offender” interviewed and

impact) where immediate response is not possible due I submitted / or closure stage within 1 month of raise

to the requirement to perform pre-interview enquiries /

analysis

All team members are reminded that every effort must be made to reach suspect offender interview stage within the timescales advised. Problems
achieving this should be relayed to line managers for concurrence, but team members should not simply rely on extending the case life by seeking
such concurrence.

Additionally, the monthly case updates, submitted for all live cases on hand, must see the progression comments for enquiries completed in enough
detail to provide a description of the case and the current status (e.g. next court date, which court, type of hearing, recovery position, awaiting CLT
advice, date of apprehension, date of interview, admissions, etc). Certainly, progression comments must be concise, but extend past one sentence
and be sufficiently informative.

All new cases will be raised by the Casework Team and will be accompanied with a case category marking.

The following is a simple table and time-line for establishing submission goals. Reviews of activity versus timescales will be undertaken by the
Casework Team, Financial Investigators and Team Leaders at 121s and other appropriate meetings.
