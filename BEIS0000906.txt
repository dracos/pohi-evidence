EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations provide for exemptions from income tax and capital gains tax in relation to
Overturned Historical Conviction compensation payments, Group Litigation Order compensation
payments and Infected Blood Scheme compensation payments and a relief from inheritance tax in
relation to Overturned Historical Conviction compensation payments and Infected Blood Scheme
compensation payments.

Overturned Historical Conviction compensation payments are made by Post Office Limited to people
who have had a conviction quashed because it involved evidence from the Horizon system. Group
Litigation Order compensation payments are made by the Department for Business, Energy and
Industrial Strategy or the Department of Business and Trade to the people who were a party toa claim
against Post Office Limited in respect of the Horizon system that was subject to a group litigation
order. The Infected Blood Scheme provides an interim compensation payment to people in receipt
of support from one of the four UK infected blood support schemes.

Schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2020 provides for exemptions and relief from tax in respect of
qualifying payments. Under paragraph 2(5) of that Schedule, the Treasury may by regulations specify
compensation payments made by a public authority or by or on behalf of the United Kingdom
government to be qualifying payments. Paragraph 3 of the Schedule provides for an exemption from
income tax in respect of receipt of a qualifying payment. Paragraph 4 of the Schedule provides
for an exemption from capital gains tax, where a disposal arises as a result of a person forfeiting,
surrendering or refraining from exercising rights in return for a qualifying payment and on a disposal
of the right to receive a qualifying payment (or an interest in such a right). Paragraph 5 of the
Schedule provides for a relief from inheritance tax where a qualifying payment is received by a
person or the personal representatives of a person and reduces the tax chargeable on the value
transferred by the transfer made on the person’s death to zero.

These exemptions and reliefs apply with retrospective effect in accordance with Regulation 1(2)
under the powers in paragraphs 3(5), 4(3)(c) and 5(7) of Schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2020. These
Regulations have effect in relation to Overturned Historical Conviction compensation payments
from 22nd July 2021, Group Litigation Order compensation payments from Ist August 2022 and
Infected Blood Scheme compensation payments from 28th October 2022.

Regulation 3 specifies that Overturned Historical Conviction compensation payments, Group
Litigation Order compensation payments and Infected Blood Scheme compensation payments are
qualifying payments for the purposes of paragraph 3 of Schedule 15. This means that there is no
liability to income tax arising from the receipt of any of these payments.

Regulation 4 specifies that Overturned Historical Conviction compensation payments, Group
Litigation Order compensation payments and Infected Blood Scheme compensation payments are
qualifying payments for the purposes of paragraph 4 of Schedule 15. This means that the transfer
by recipients of their rights in return for a compensation payment, or their disposal of the right to
receive such a payment, does not give rise to gains chargeable to capital gains tax.

Regulation 5 specifies that Overturned Historical Conviction compensation payments and Infected
Blood Scheme compensation payments are qualifying payments for the purposes of paragraph 5 of
Schedule 15. This means that these compensation payments are relieved from inheritance tax.

A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact
on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
