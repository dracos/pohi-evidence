Subject:RE: Letter from James Arbuthnot MP.

Hi, I think after yesterday's meeting we can start drafting this. Sophie, would you be able to, please?

My suggestion is that the thrust is - re the update for MPs, Paula reiterates that she wrote in confidence to JA previously
and does not expect him to use her comments re, e.g the SS report not being ready, publicly. She will consult the Chair
when he is back in the country about what could go in an update to MPs.

On the AB letter, P understands AB may be under pressure but the aim of him being involved in the WG is that he is part
of the oversight of the Scheme and with that comes responsibility. I think the approach should be that the WG
discussed the letter, that is the right place for its contents to be discussed and the Chair has written to the Minister
following that discussion. That was the right place for the discussion.

Views?
Best wishes

Belinda
