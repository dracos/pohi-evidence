Who we are

The team are made up of 10 people inc team leader. Previously the individuals worked on their
specific product area, this sometimes prevented visibility of the full picture, so going forward we
will focus on specific theft and fraud indicators to see the bigger picture.

We are now split into 3 Regions plus Northern Ireland, mirroring the Security Operations — South,
Midlands and North regions. 3 People per Region, monitoring approx 1200 — 1300 offices each

South Adam Torincsi, Andy Baker, Caroline Bramley
Midlands Richard Marples, Gill Handbury, lan Crookes
North Sandra Daykin, Mark Frost, Eleanor Kimberley
N Ireland Colette McAteer

Colette will also be responsible for identifying and escalating issues with McColl branches.

Todays purpose is to build links with all of you in FSC, so that you know who to
come to:
