Subject: ExCo paper - settlement policy

Importance: High

Dear all, please find attached a first draft of a paper for ExCo for approval of the Settlement Policy.

The paper will need to be cleared by Chris and sent out by 2pm on Wednesday. Angela and Chris are attending the
ExCo meeting and therefore will need to be able to answer questions on it.

Grateful for comments by CoP today. Feel free to make drafting as well as substantive improvements as it needs

some tidying.

Rod, would you get this cleared by Chris A when we have comments?

Best wishes
Belinda
