Subject: Witness Statement Review

Attachments: Penny's standard template Dec 05.doc

Please find attached a copy of my initial mark up of my witness statement, which I will send to Graham Ward this morning.

Penny's standard
template Dec 05.

I have not included additional applications which Gareth highlighted, I thought I'd do that once I understood more about
them.

Please let me have any comments you may have asap.
Kind regards

Penny
